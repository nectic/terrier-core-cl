SCOTTISH Eastern Investment Trust surged ahead during the six months
to July 31, boosted by the investment of more than #20m of borrowed
funds on buoyant world equity markets.
The #764m trust managed by Martin Currie of Edinburgh saw net asset
value rise by 18% to 103.8p per share, outpacing a 13.4% rise in the FT
Actuaries World Index and a 15% rise in the FT All-Share index over the
same period.
The interim dividend was raised 6% to 0.55p per share from 0.52p last
time and earnings per share rocketed 69% to 1.18p.
''Particularly good performances were achieved by the North American
and Continental European portfolio, while, following an excellent 1994,
the trust's unlisted investments continued to add significant value for
shareholders with six major realisations,'' Martin Currie said.
Scottish Eastern has total borrowings of #102m, of which more than
#25m are still held in cash. But fund manager Eric McAuslan said these
balances would be fully invested in emerging markets in Asia and Latin
America over the next month.
''We are looking to an increased exposure in South America, which will
possibly include a return to Mexico,'' he said.
Besides investing available cash, the trust may switch some
investments from North America, now seen as fully valued, into emerging
markets, he added.

Washington, Tuesday,
THE United States has detected no evidence that Iraq is preparing to
invade any of its neighbours but is moving men and equipment to the
region as a precaution, Defence Secretary William Perry said today.
''There have been some unusual deployments of Iraqi military forces,''
he told reporters in his Pentagon office. However he termed the Iraqi
military activity ''nothing that leads us to believe that any invasion
is under way or planned''.
The Pentagon announced last week that it was sending ships with tanks
and arms for as many as 22,000 troops closer to the region in response
to what it called a five-week-old pattern of unusual Iraqi troop
movements.
The United States also moved more warships to the area and advanced a
scheduled training exercise in Kuwait.
Perry did not make clear whether the unusual Iraqi movements were
continuing, but he said the situation on the ground bore little or no
resemblance to last October, when more than 10,000 Iraqi troops menaced
the Kuwaiti border before eventually withdrawing.
''It is a matter that bears careful watching, and we are watching it
very carefully. In the meantime, we're taking prudent actions,'' he said
of the Iraqi movements.
He added that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could not be trusted,
despite his new, fuller disclosures to United Nations arms inspectors
about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. ''He has deceived us many
times in the past,'' Perry said.
He said a top Iraqi aide who defected to Jordan this month had
confirmed a US assessment that Iraq had been preparing to invade Kuwait
last October. An earlier Iraqi invasion, in August 1990, was reversed
the next year by a US-led multi-national coalition.
Lieutenant General Hussein Kamel Hassan Majeed, Saddam's son-in-law,
who headed the country's secret weapons programme, also said Saddam was
planning to invade Kuwait and Saudi Arabia this month but called off the
attack after he defected along with another Saddam son-in-law, their
wives, and aides.
Perry said Saddam still had the same possible rationale for an
invasion -- his failure to get the UN Security Council to lift the
punishing post-Gulf War sanctions aimed at forcing Iraq to hand over any
remainining secrets about biological, chemical, or nuclear arms
programmes.
''A very big difference, though, is that in October 1994 we saw the
evidence on the ground -- deployments. We do not see that evidence
today,'' he said.
Hussein Kamel is still being debriefed in Jordan by officers of the
Central Intelligence Agency and other US officials. A US official, who
asked not to be identified, said the United States did not look
favourably on the possible rise to power of Hussein Kamel as successor
to Saddam.
''He's got a pretty chequered record,'' the official said.
Hussein Kamel, who was also industry minister, was granted asylum in
Jordan after defecting on August 8.
Today Rolf Ekeus, the UN official in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, met him at a secret location in Jordan.
Ekeus, who received previously concealed information in Baghdad before
going to Amman, could double-check the fresh data with Hussein Kamel,
who had built the secret military programmes.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Carers count the cost of new community system</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>RON MACKENNA</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976748552</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SHARP indictment of the Government's care in the community system
was delivered by one of Britain's largest charities yesterday.
Almost one in five disabled people are now paying for services that
previously were free, according to a study commissioned by the cerebral
palsy charity, Scope.
The charity consulted more than 1500 disabled people and 1300 carers.
It discovered that 31% of disabled people and 35% of carers are
dissatisfied with the social work service.
A co-author of the report said the care in the community system had
forced ''many to rely on the unpaid care given by family and friends''.
The Scope survey was confined to England and Wales, but charities
north of the Border spoke of similar problems.
Mr Alan McGinlay, Scottish co-ordinater of the Carers' National
Association, said it echoed a survey completed by his own charity
earlier this year, with four out of five carers stating they believed
the new care in the community system had made no difference.
He said: ''I don't think there are significant differences nationally.
Our survey concentrated on how carers saw community care affecting them.
And there is still quite a bit of concern about community care.
''The survey found one in four carers recorded a significant increase
in charges and had declined services because of that. That is a
significant figure. We also discovered that 80% of carers feel that care
in the community has made no difference, and 8% felt it had made things
significantly worse.''
Mr Norman Dunning, director of Enable, the Scottish charity for people
with learning disabilities, said that while charging was not an issue
for his client group at the moment, he expected it would be.
''Where we have experienced problems is in the length of time social
work departments are taking to carry out assessments. People are having
to wait months for them.''
Strathclyde said 97,000 assessments had been carried out in the region
last year with about one third being assessments of carers' needs.
A spokeswoman for the region's social work department said that a
means-tested charge on certain services, including home care, had always
been levied irrespective of care in the community.
''It has never been a free service, although it is free to some
people,'' she said.
She added that the average time taken from receiving a referral to
delivering the decision was about 2.6 weeks.
That figure was challenged by Mr Dunning. ''I dispute that. It is not
our experience. In one of our branch establishments in Cumbernauld,
there are 42 people who needed assessment. They were started a year ago
and are still not completed.''
Mr Brian Lamb, co-author of the Scope report, Disabled in Britain:
Counting on Community Care, said: ''First hand experiences of disabled
people and their carers show that community care is a system that is in
danger of failing its original aim to provide quality, choice and
efficiency and has in fact forced many to rely on the unpaid care given
by family and friends.''
* One in four patients are too scared to visit a doctor because of
high prescription charges, according to a survey.
A quarter of 1000 people questioned in the report by business
information group Key Note said they preferred to ignore the doctor and
just go to the chemist.
About half also said they would ask a pharmacist if there was a
cheaper alternative to what the doctor ordered.
Almost six in ten would not consult a doctor or a pharmacist if
feeling ill and trust their own judgment in buying remedies.
One in three did not trust modern medicine, claiming they did not
expect that the remedies advised by doctors would cure them at all.

THE current drought is affecting potato crops in all Northern European
countries, fuelling speculation not only about yield levels but also
possible losses from secondary growth, according to the Potato Marketing
Board.
The board warned, however, that it is too early to speculate on final
yield and the extent of secondary growth losses this season. Modern
husbandry techniques and the increased use of irrigation will ensure
this year does not mirror the poor crop season of 1976 following drought
conditions.
Varieties lifted at present are showing similar yields to last year --
and in Scotland they are slightly higher. Last week average ex-farm
prices in Britain rose by #41.14 to reach #159.96 a tonne, compared to
#139.21 last year.

<TEXT>
AS many as 500 jobs could be lost in the privatisation of British
Rail's Red Star parcels business which is being sold off for just #1,
Labour claimed yesterday.
The business is to be sold to a management buy-out team which intends
to cut the workforce from 700 to ''220 or fewer'', Shadow Transport
Secretary Michael Meacher claimed.
The team would buy the business with a ''rent sweetener of about
#1.5m'', said Mr Meacher.
He added that Labour intended to refer the sale to the all-party House
of Commons Public Accounts Committee.
Earlier, the Government said it was confident the proposed deal
represented the best value for the taxpayer and industry.
However, Mr Meacher said last night that the Government's ''feeble
defence to this scandal has already been ripped to shreds''.
He said three alternative bidders had approached Labour to say their
offers were ''substantially better'' than that of the management buy-out
team, thus refuting the claims that the existing deal was the best for
taxpayers.
Mr Meacher went on: ''BR is paying the failed management team to take
Red Star away and is paying huge redundancy bills to help cut the
company workforce by two-thirds.''
Transport Minister John Watts said the Department of Transport was
likely to approve the deal.
He added: ''It is not a tragedy. It is a successful privatisation sale
which ensures the business continues, and the railway will continue to
offer a premium, high-speed parcel service.''

. . . in your ear, Michael. I do hope you enjoyed your holiday, though
catching a glimpse of you in the corridor yesterday I thought you looked
a little pale. Not too good for the glowing image all you senior chaps
are supposed to cultivate these days. Perhaps Warner-Meek Ltd could
advise on a make-over, as the women's mags seem to call it. You know the
sort of thing, a touch of bronze pancake or the like. Never forget you
are the successor to old Adonis Lang. Anyway, enough of that. Perhaps
nature's imperfections are more appealing. I've got more important
matters to discuss. Water, in fact. No, don't fret, it's not about
leaks, at least not the sort you're thinking of. Timing could hardly be
worse but the new water quangos are meeting this week. What with all
this heat and drought a convention of dowsers in the Gobi desert would
have been more believable. Anyway, there they were, banging on about
openness and the need to work in the public eye. Now we all know that
transparency is to be the watchword of the water authorities (though
personally I prefer the phrase ''gin clear''), but what do we mean by
that?
Of course you're in favour of quangos; aren't we all? But the media
prattlers insist on accountability and democracy. Nonsense, of course.
What could be more democratic than water? It's everywhere, especially
when it's making a nuisance of itself. But we have to accept that there
is a good deal of suspicion out there and some people don't help. Gummer
for one. What possessed him to talk about meters and low-flush toilets.
Hardly a view of the New Jerusalem, is it? Then there's John Jameson in
the West with his accountability gap and Ian Young of Strathkelvin
acknowledging the fears of the average tap-turner about the
establishment of the new authorities. Not to mention that ticklish
affair in the Highlands. The problem is, the leak has sprung. All this
talk of meetings open to the public and press has created expectations.
Yes, we're in favour of it, but now we're hemmed in. These meetings
really must be open: we can't have the old council trick of three items
in public and the rest in private. You'll have to have a word in their
ear.
To be continued.

ONE could just imagine the self-satisfied grin on Stewart Lamont's
face as he sat writing his article congratulating himself on having such
''common sense'' values (August 19). But I see nothing sensible about
his views, nor do I believe that his opinions are common to most people.
Of course it is not ideal that an under-age girl should have a baby,
although it's hard to find parents who would meet an ideal standard.
But to suggest that such girls should have their children taken from
them, even though a bond of love may have formed between the mother and
child, is not so much ''common sense'' as fascist arrogance.
One can just imagine a young 15-year-old clinging desperately to the
baby she loves while men in dark suits struggle to take it away from
her, telling the girl that this is the common-sense way to solve the
problem of teenage pregnancies.
If Mr Lamont sees his values as an antidote to political correctness,
all I can say is come back political correctness, all is forgiven.

SCOTTISH farmers' representatives will raise the question of
allocation of sheep quotas from the national reserve when they meet the
new Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, the Earl of Lindsay, at
Ingliston today.
The Minister's visit to the National Farmers' Union of Scotland's
headquarters will be his first official contact with the organisation,
and the current controversy over livestock quotas will elevate it above
the level of a normal courtesy call.
NFUS president John Ross has made it clear that in his view it is up
to the Government to sort out the legal mess steming from an English
High Court decision that regulations applied in the allocation of quota
from the national reserve since 1993 are unlawful.
The NFUS was not a party to the successful legal action brought by the
English union, but as its consequences begin to be realised, it is
considering raising an action in the Court of Session to protect the
interests of Scottish farmers.
It has also been involved in detailed technical talks with the
Scottish Office, and John Ross has declared himself delighted with the
positive stance taken by Lord Lindsay. ''He seems to understand that the
high-handed attitude of the English ministry will not wash in
Scotland,'' he said.
The NFUS has already consulted its lawyers, who have asked a Queen's
Counsel to look at the possibility of raising a case in the Court of
Session, although it hopes matters will be settled by negotiation.
The issue centres on the Government's insistence that ''developers''
seeking quota from the national reserve to increase their flock would
have to show documentary proof of a previously declared intention to
expand their operation.
The High Court in England found the Government's interpretation of the
rules, contained in European legislation, unlawful and said that
documentary proof could not be demanded.
If the issue came to court in Scotland it could prove complex for
lawyers to untangle. Technically, the statutory instrument which the
English union opposed in court is still lawful here as it has not been
challenged in the Scottish courts.
The indications are that the Government will seek to ''re-run'' the
applications for quota from the national reserve, with the likelihood
that people previously refused will now qualify. As the quota ''cake''
remains the same size, some existing holders could find their allocation
reduced.
Such a move could, however, be subject to further legal challenge by
the NFU in England.
The unions on both sides of the Border will be pressing for adequate
compensation for farmers whose exclusion from quota allocation has
resulted in financial loss.
* MEMBERS of Parliament are to be lobbied by farmers' representatives
in advance of this year's hill farming review. NFUS area executives have
been asked to organise meetings with their local MPs to make the case
for an increase in Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances this autumn.
With feed and other costs rising, hill farmers, who faced a standstill
in HLCA last year, will be pressing for a substantial increase.

C PRIMROSE makes out a well-worn case against socialism (August 18).
The letter mentions various religions but not witch-doctors.
Society has a history of change and there is always a religion ready
to convince its followers that this is the way it should be and always
will be.
Socialism is not a religion. Its concept is the result of historical
research which concluded that the basis of society is economic -- how
people have to obtain the means of living.
Capitalism was an essential stage in the development of society, but
it has now outlived its usefulness. Through fierce competition among
rival companies and countries it developed the means of production and
technology to the stage where the needs of society, with the assistance
of millions of unemployed, including university graduates, can produce
the needs of society almost like water running from a tap.
C Primrose refers to that hoary old chestnut of human nature. Of
course there are differences. It depends on what school we attended and
how we were brought up. Some people like classical music, others like
jazz; some like steaks and others are vegetarians.
But so long as these needs can be satisfied, as they can be now, we
are all Jock Tamson's Bairns, and socialism is a sure-fire winner.

ALF YOUNG is, of course, entirely right (August 18). Scotland ''needs
a responsible press with the freedom to reflect Scottish aspirations and
priorities, Scottish concerns and choices''. The same is true of
broadcasting.
The resistance of Scottish readers to the blandishments of the English
price war is a clear proof of the need and desire of Scottish readers
for their own newspapers.
Alf Young is also right to suggest that the independence of the
Scottish press would be much more secure in Scottish ownership; but that
would not be sufficient by itself.
I suggest that a mechanism is needed to ensure editorial independence
and the fair and impartial appointment of the editors, perhaps by means
of a charter and a widely representative body of trustees.
With such a mechanism it should be possible for all sections of
Scottish opinion to support, and invest in, a major Scottish company.
Without it, any talk of an initiative by a group of self-confessed
Tories is bound to arouse deep suspicion. It would, in any case, be
self-defeating and a commercial absurdity.
For years the Tories have ignored and defied Scottish opinion, and
have shown that they are incapable of understanding it or reflecting it.

THE Scottish food industry will be the sole representative from the UK
next month at a major food exhibition in China, writes DAN BUGLASS.
Originally there was going to be one stand promoting the excellence of
British products, but following a lack of enthusiasm in England, Scots
will have the honour of flying the flag with seven individual companies
taking space.
Funding for the Scottish presence is coming from the Department of
Trade and Industry, while Scottish Enterprise is co-ordinating the
effort. Following last year's outstanding success, this year's
exhibition hopes to attract more than 11,000 visitors.
The event will be truly international with in excess of 4000
exhibitors participating from more than 30 countries.
The Scottish Pavilion is part of a #6.2m international food and drink
exhibition programme funded by the participating companies in
partnership with Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise
and Scottish Trade International. The aim is to boost Scottish food and
drink exports by #36m over a three-year period.
Lorna Jack, head of the food team at Scottish Enterprise, commented:
''Last year we had a small presence with 20 Scottish products on show
and it was clear that there was enormous potential in China.
''We are, of course, particularly pleased to have pulled off this
coup, in being the sole representatives from the UK. I think this
demonstrates the willingness of the entire Scottish food sector to get
out there and go for new markets.''
Burn Stewart Distillers will be exhibiting in China for the first
time, and marketing director Mike Cowman said: ''China's domestic drinks
market is fast becoming one of the biggest in the world, and we are
obviously very keen to develop trade links and establish a reputation in
what proposes to be a very lucrative market over the next few years.''
According to the latest figures, the Scottish food and drinks industry
is worth something in excess of #6000m each year, making it one of the
top five earners for the economy with a major part of that total coming
from exports.
Of the #6000m no less than half comes from whisky sales. The demand
for grain-based spirits is one factor boosting the fortunes of Scottish
arable farmers, with a sizeable tonnage of malting barley sold to China
both this year and last.

TO REGULATE or not to regulate? The answer to this conundrum can be
helped by analysis and statistics but the eventual solution lies in
ideology and the belief system of those who must make the decision.
Nevertheless, we can have some illumination along the way and this is
particularly relevant and useful in respect of that great de-regulated
jungle, the provision of bus services. The Labour Party drove into the
middle of the dispute yesterday with a strong-minded report which
successfully attacked much of the de-regulation which has fragmented bus
services throughout the country and led to a bewildering variety of
claim and counter-claim, not to mention behaviour which would have
graced the Borgias. Labour's document insists that there are fewer
passengers paying higher fares. It alleges that buses are older, thus
contributing to pollution, and that although there are fewer passengers
the plethora of de-regulated buses is travelling ever-greater mileages
in the search for dwindling numbers of customers. This does not appear
to be a healthy situation, especially when taken together with the
numerous claims of deplorable and predatory actions taken by some bus
companies in the effort to seize business from competitors.
Some in the bus industry acknowledge the thrust of Labour's figures
but suggest that they tend to convey a generalised picture which is not
applicable to those companies which have made a success of the system.
There is truth in this, but it is a patchy and partial sort of defence
and only true for certain areas of the country. Detailed evidence from
all areas is hard to find and would certainly repay some investigative
work by interested parties. Nevertheless, the thrust of available
evidence, and not just that contained in Labour's report, speaks of a
loss of services in rural areas and in large housing schemes, of fares
which, though initially low to gain business, have now climbed to a
point where travel is difficult for the old and the poor, and where the
concept of bus services as a money-making enterprise instead of a
service to a community is now paramount. This is not good enough.
Research is needed, but the suspicion must be that the de-regulation of
buses has brought great benefits to a minority of company owners, but
nothing of the sort to the general public.

YOUR report, SNP calls for end to bias on councils (August 12), quotes
Mr Andrew Welsh, Vice-president of the Scottish National Party, as
citing Clydebank District Council as a council which bars opposition
councillors from all committees.
As chairman of the policy and resources committee of Clydebank
District Council I would point out that this council operates a policy
of ''all-member committees'', thus ensuring that there is no bar on
opposition councillors.

I WAS interested to read (August 21) that I had attacked George
Galloway and Dennis Canavan. I did neither.
Certainly I defended the reforms in the Labour Party and questioned
some of the motives that lay behind the criticisms of them. However, it
has not been my habit to reduce political debate to the level of
personalities or to attack individual members in my public statements.
I realise it makes for easy reporting and ''spices up'' a story.
However, I trust that under the circumstances you will print this
letter.
On future occasions if you cannot report faithfully and without
embellishment what I say in my statements then I would rather you didn't
report them at all.

IT must have been over 40 years ago, I sadly realise, when my school
pals and I sat hunched in front of a nine-inch Murphy television set,
the only one in our street, to watch Dennis Compton hit the winning run
against Australia and guarantee the Ashes for England.
As I recall, the weather was fine that summer too; adults were
muttering that we should have been playing outside.
Well, I don't care how hot it is tomorrow or for the rest of the
weekend, I intend to follow the Sixth Test between our lot and the
Windies at every available moment from silly mid-on -- my favourite
armchair is already in that position.
What a finale, the most important Test for decades, a chance to beat
the best in the world in the climax of an enthralling series.
There has been skill and courage on both sides; Dominic Cork's hat
trick, not to mention his batting; Brian Lara oozing class and runs in
equal measure; Mike Atherton's leadership; the controlled aggression of
Curtley Ambrose; the steadfast impartiality of the umpires; the constant
snick of broken fingers, the fearful hits taken both at the crease and
in the field.
Cricket is a dull game? Sure, only for those who like their contests
to be over in 89 seconds.
Now I ought to acknowledge, for it is undeniably the case, that there
are those among us who would prefer the West Indies to triumph. They
come from the ''anyone who beats the English is a friend of ours''
school, a misguided academy of narrow nationalism.
The facts are that not only have Scots, plus Irishmen and Welsh,
contributed greatly to the England team, their descendants still do. The
forefathers of such as Alec Stewart and Angus Fraser are unlikely to
have hailed from deepest Devon or even Darlington.
It is quite healthy to oppose the English, to thoroughly dislike Brian
Moore and Will Carling, when you have a comparable team of your own to
support, manifestly absurd to adopt such a stance when one does not. End
of sermon.
I am delighted that the selectors have recalled Philip Tufnell to the
colours for the decider. For some reason which totally excapes me the
Middlesex spinner is known as ''The Cat'' -- to me he has always looked
more like a lounge lizard.
Tufnell can be a naughty boy, caught having a quick fag on the long
leg boundary, always ready to give the heckling crowd as bad as he is
receiving, likely to throw the odd tantrum if Dickie Bird turns down his
appeal.
But he is also a match-winner in the same mould as Ally McCoist (hope
they win, too, as should all true Scottish sports supporters), a man for
whom no occasion is too big.
Devon Malcolm is actually England's only genuine fast bowler, so the
Derbyshire flier should be welcomed back as well. He can be expensive,
moody, and a big girls' blouse of a batsman but, on song, the sound
which will be his trademark will be the crashing of West Indian timber.
I would like to have been at the Oval but, in truth, what with the
heat and the declining standards among spectators, I will probably enjoy
it just as much from the living-room. For that, thanks to the BBC, who
still field the finest cricket broadcasting team anywhere in the globe.
(The corporation, by the way, should listen to some of the people they
are paying to tell us about women's golf these days. At Dalmahoy and at
Woburn recently, the twittering birds, the real ones that is, made more
sense than many of the reporters).
Richie Benaud is my all-time favourite- concise, authoritative,
laconic. As a streaker was led away during this series he observed:
''There is little need for the covers to come out.''
Tony Lewis weaves his Welsh way most acceptably but the relatively new
stars -- is anyone surprised? -- are Geoffrey Boycott and David Gower.
Boycott, his ego as big as the Oval gasometer, dishes out faint praise
for the simple reason that believes he could still bat better than
anyone currently on show. Perhaps he's right.
He also mangles the language unmercifully. ''He's got to play eet more
on the front feet, 'as 'ick, if he goes back he is goin' nowhere.''
Indeed.
Gower, I suspect, will be gently twitting our Geoffrey, just as he did
when they played together. David was on about hair weaves the other day,
a topic very close to Boycott's skull.
The hours to come in the company of such men are to be savoured . . .
a famous victory even more so.

WE are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Ibrahim (Neil)
Golightly while undertaking humanitarian aid to the victims of the war
in former Yugoslavia.
Ibrahim's (Neil's) association with our community began in January,
1994, when we sent our first convoy to Bosnia. He was extremely helpful
and had dedicated much of his time in assisting the victims of the war
in the former Yugoslavia. He did this principally by ferrying aid to
those in need whoever they were irrespective of their faith or racial
origin.
Having lived there for much of the last three years he got to know
both the terrain and the people well and had the sense and wisdom to put
this knowledge to good effect. In all our numerous convoys he played a
key role in advising us on the routes, times, and places and often
accompanied our convoys to their destinations inside Bosnia.
He was a man with vision; extremely resourceful and astute. In the
complex and ever-changing situation in that part of the world he was the
person to whom many turned for advice. He was blessed with an amiable
personality and many of our members who got to know him were impressed
with his selfless determination and resolve as well as his efficiency
and wisdom.
It is a mark of the impression he made on us that as soon as we heard
the tragic news, we were phoning each other in order to console and
offer comfort to one another. It is very much as if a close family
member has passed away.
He will be sorely missed. He died for a virtuous cause -- a cause in
which he deeply believed in and we pray that he may be granted a lofty
position in paradise.

NEIL GOLIGHTLY'S death is yet another tragedy inflicted upon a
Scottish family through the savagery of the Serbs. Neil sacrificed his
life for a cause dear to him, ie to save the lives of helpless starving
people. What a noble cause and what a supreme sacrifice!
The courage and fortitude of Neil's grieved but proud parents is an
equally supreme manifestation of human generosity and dignity. It is,
indeed, an apt epitaph to the cherished memory of their brave and
selfless son.

I FIND myself shocked by the insinuation of Mr Bashir Maan that the
British decision on Bosnia is inspired by religious bigotry. Surely Mr
Maan has prospered in this country not only by his own business acumen
but also due to the tolerant society he has chosen to live in.
It is an accepted fact that the British per capita give more in aid to
alleviate the sufferings of Third World countries and recent political
and enthnic disaster areas such as Bosnia, purely on humane grounds.
Mr Maan is most fortunate in his decision to leave Pakistan, which has
become one of the most unstable areas on the planet where rioting and
religious killings are carried out regularly.
I accept Britain is not the perfect society to live in but having
travelled extensively thanks to service in the Mechant Navy, I can
assure your readers that Britain is still one of the most stable and
tolerant societies to live in.

DESPERATE things are happening in Zaire, where thousands of Rwandan
and Burundian refugees are being forced out of camps and back to their
troubled homelands. The process is inhuman and, if some reports are to
be believed, is accompanied by looting, beatings, and rape. The first
lesson to be absorbed from this continuing nightmare is that a
simplistic analysis is almost always unhelpful. The second lesson is
that the rest of the world appears to be standing aside, as it almost
always does when African problems are involved. The complexity of the
problem in Zaire is desperately difficult to unravel. The refugees, who
are mostly of Hutu ethnic origin, are in Zaire because they fled there
when the Hutu-dominated government in Rwanda fell to Tutsi rebels, but
not before around half-a-million Rwandan Tutsis were murdered by Hutus
in a transparent attempt at genocide. The Tutsis, therefore, had good
reason to flee and have equally lively apprehensions about what might
happen to them if they go, or are forced, back to Rwanda. Much the same
applies to the Burundians who fled their country into Zaire because of
similar ethnically-inspired troubles.
It is clear that the authorities in Zaire should not force these
people back into their homeland, if only on simple humanitarian grounds.
Yet the government in Zaire has its own problems. That impoverished
country has the largest refugee population in the world, estimated very
roughly at some 1.2 million souls from Angola, Sudan, and Uganda as well
as Rwanda and Burundi. This would be an intolerable burden for a
developed country. Consider, for instance, the number of refugees that
Britain has been pleased to accept from anywhere recently. What we do
have is a human obligation to try to help. This will be difficult
because the government of Zaire does not appear to be in a mood to
compromise. It has ignored appeals from the United Nations to halt the
expulsions, but these appeals might be heard with more attention if they
could be coupled with solid and sustained offers of material and
diplomatic help instead of the usual empty-handed appeals of the heroic
staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Only
prosperous Western nations can ease this situation, but will they?

A FEW years ago Scottish Enterprise kicked up some dust by proposing
to finance a feasibility study to pipe water from Scotland to quench the
thirst of the perfidious Albion. Prominent among the protesters (of whom
I was happy to be one) were a considerable number of local authority
councillors who saw within the scheme the dangers of the private
companies from south of the Border muscling into Scottish water and
turning a public service into a private market.
The Scottish Enterprise executives involved in the abortive project
may have allowed themselves a wry smile yesterday at the news that
Strathclyde region was proposing to have Scottish water sold not for
English gold but for Spanish dubloons.
According to reports, some 20 million gallons a week will soon be off
to supplement the rain in Spain while gardeners in Burntisland are
performing rain dances and looking anxiously to the heavens.
Strathclyde claims it is easier to send water to sunny Spain than to
pipe it 30 miles to Fife, or indeed other parched areas of Scotland, and
it may well be right. However, despite the fact that public criticism
has been pretty muted so far they will excuse me if I feel somewhat
uneasy about this latest wheeze.
I accept my doubts may be irrational. After all, Scotland is a country
brimming over with natural resources and we sell, or rather have sold on
our behalf, the lot. Land, oil, and gas are traded back and forth
without anyone turning a hair
Scotland already has a booming industry in selling spring water at a
considerable premium and no-one objects or should object. So why should
it be different for bulk quantities of public water, except for a
practical concern that they may be lowering the premium position of the
bottled Scottish product.
One thing that should make us at least uneasy is the clear evidence
emerging from south of the Border on the far-reaching consequences of
privatisation and treating something as vital as water as just another
consumer good. Up until now the debate has been focused on the sharply
rising cost of water and the executive perks which were just about the
only thing rising faster in percentage terms.
That debate in itself has been pretty vigorous, but nothing compared
with the present storm. The past few weeks of rising temperatures and
tempers in England has indicated a deeper process at work. It is clear
that when the private companies appealed for public cooperation to
combat the drought conditions they were met by sullen and bitter
criticism.
Virtually no-one believed that the threat of stand pipes in the
streets was testimony to anything other than company greed and
incompetence.
I'm not saying that Scottish local authorities are swept away by a
public ready to water their gardens with bath water at the first hint of
shortage but at least no-one in Scotland is seriously saying that the
councils have an ulterior motive in calling for conservation. They will
have a motive if water is needed to fulfil lucrative contracts
elsewhere.
South of the Border the implication from the Government's own
consultation document is pretty clear. The only effective method of
conservation within a private system is water metering. No other
commodity is traded generally without reference to the quantity
consumed, and if water is just to be another commodity then why should
it be any different?
Thanks to the public opposition generated in the water campaign we are
not yet down that rocky road in Scotland. However, there is little room
for complacency and the new water watchdog in Scotland is going to have
a giant task in effectively monitoring the new quangos.
In addition, the build, own, and operate schemes for private finance
are not back-door but front-door privatisation. And there is little
doubt that Strathclyde sending Scotland's rain to the Spanish plains
adds to the view of water as a commodity as opposed to a vital public
service.
And so if we are going to sell our public water then let us at least
have a debate and the protection of some clear ground rules.
First, that we should have an infrastructure in Scotland that can
supply the whole before we send water elsewhere.
Secondly, that there is a recognition that the real economic benefit
from Scotland's relative abundance of good quality water is that it
makes our country an attractive place to locate for industry and for
people.
Finally, we might remember that when it does rain it comes down upon
all of us. Aren't we all entitled to share in the benefits?

THE Scottish inter-district championship will take on greater
significance this season with a likely place in Europe to play for next
year.
This season the first steps towards the establishment of a
fully-fledged European Championship will be taken with club sides or
provinces from France, Wales, Ireland, Romania, and Italy competing in a
12-team mini competition which will run from October to December.
During the 1996-97 season Scottish and English teams will join the
competition, thus fulfilling the widely expressed desire -- not least by
this newspaper a couple of years ago -- for a properly constituted
European championship.
Although the Scottish Rugby Union have yet to make a final decision on
Scottish representation, it is virtually certain that district sides and
not club teams will fly the saltire.
Ireland confirmed yesterday they will enter provincial teams in this
season's mini-tournament. The format was discussed at a meeting of the
Home Nations' committee at the weekend and Ireland are likely to be
represented by their three strongest provinces.
Scottish club sides are unlikely to prove strong enough to face top
French, Welsh or English clubs -- which are in all but name district
sides in any case -- hence the SRU's preference that Glasgow, Edinburgh,
South of Scotland, the Exiles or North and Midlands should make up the
Scottish representation.
SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer said yesterday: ''I'm still awaiting
the details but the decision was taken that it was not feasible for us
to enter this season because of the restructured leagues and the
introduction of a Scottish Cup competition.
''We have not discussed it in detail, but my own view is that Scotland
will be represented by district sides and we will be trying to get as
many of them as possible into the new European competition,'' he said.
''We haven't yet decided how the teams will be chosen but the results
of this season's district championship are likely to come into it. That
would provide an even greater incentive for district players to do well
in the inter-district championship.''
However, at a time when the clubs are striving to maintain their
autonomy -- and even allowing for this season's new league and cup
structure -- the advent of a European competition with district
representation from Scotland will be seen in some quarters as further
emasculation of the power of the clubs.
Telfer has been a long-time advocate of the need to concentrate on the
districts along the lines of the New Zealand provincial structure where
the clubs play second fiddle to the powerful provincial sides and where
players' ties with their clubs, as opposed to their provinces, are very
much in name only.
Scotland and England were unable to change their fixtures for the
forthcoming season but with their involvement next year the championship
will cater for 16 teams.
''I'm delighted we are there at last after nine months of hard work,''
said Welsh Rugby Union chairman Vernon Pugh.
''It could have been earlier if some clubs hadn't muddied the waters,
but it will be a good thing for the European club game. We've got two
major international companies interested in sponsoring the competition
and a decision on that, and a number of other matters, will be taken
soon.''
Wales have already invited Heineken League champions Cardiff,
runners-up Pontypridd, and Welsh Cup-winners Swansea to take part, while
the French have entered their cup winners and two top league clubs.
Michael Lynagh's Treviso, Wayne Shelford's Rome, and Diego Dominguez's
Milan sides are battling it out to clinch the two places likely to be
granted to the Italians, while Romania will put forward their top club
side.
Each team in the championship, which will contain four pools, will be
guaranteed one home and one away match, with gate receipts being
retained by the hosts.
Winners of each group will go forward to the semi-finals, limiting the
number of games any team will play to four. ''That should be no great
burden on the players, but will give them a taste of standards and
competition above their current domestic levels,'' added Pugh.
Scottish International Board representative Freddie McLeod, who has
been involved in IB and Home Nations' committee talks on the European
venture, said: ''Scotland will not become involved for another year or
so and before any decisions are reached we will certainly be taking the
proposals to the clubs once we have something concrete to discuss.''

PEOPLE are waiting longer before tying the knot, according to official
figures released by the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys,
yesterday.
The findings show that men and women are, on average, three years
older when they marry, compared to a decade ago. Suggesting that, if
current trends continue, the average man in the next century will be 30
when he weds.
The figures, based on statistics for 1993, confirm previous figures
showing the number of marriages that year fell to a 50-year low. There
were 299,000 marriages -- a 4% fall on the previous year -- and 165,000
divorces, the highest number recorded.
The long-term trend to delay marriage is confirmed elsewhere, with the
average ages at first marriage for men and women 28.2 and 26.2
respectively, compared with 25.7 and 23.4, in 1983.
Just more than half, 51%, of all marriages were solemnised with a
civil ceremony, and 49% with a religious one.
Of men and women born in 1961, 62% of men and 74% of women had married
by age 30. For those born in 1951, the corresponding proportions were
78% and 88%.
The report also shows:
* The overall marriage rate for men was 37.3 (marriages per 1000
unmarried males aged 16 and more), and for women 32.4 (marriages per
1000 unmarried females aged 16 and more). This compares with 38.6 and
33.5 respectively in 1992, and 51.2 and 41.8 in 1983.
* The average ages of husbands and wives who divorced in 1993, were 37
and 35 respectively, about one year older than their counterparts who
divorced in 1983.
* The average length of marriages which ended in divorce in 1993, was
9.8 years, compared with 10.1 years in 1983.
* In 1993, there were 95,000 divorcing couples with children less than
age 16 (58% of all couples divorcing), compared with 91,000 in 1992, and
87,000 in 1983.
* There were 176,000 children aged less than 16, whose family was
broken by divorce in 1993.

the charm is laid on with a trowel, credibility flies out the window
almost from the start, and the long arm of coincidence interferes with
the plot.
Maybe the problem is that Steve Martin, while a polished comedian, as
an actor has his limitations. It would be untrue to say he can only run
the gamut of emotions from A to B, but if he ever gets as far as F it
will be a red letter day. He is, to be blunt, miscast.
Since he wrote the script, very loosely based on George Eliot's Silas
Marner, and is the executive producer, the film is very much his baby.
It may well never have been made unless he had agreed to play the Silas
role.
Comedians always want to play Hamlet when Bottom is about their limit
and Martin seems no exception. But comedians who turn actor, unless they
are actors in the first place, should only assume roles which suit their
comic personality.
Martin's personality is that of a smart alec, a resourceful deceiver,
which is why the Cyrano role in Roxanne suited him so well. Not that
things are helped by the decision to dye his naturally white hair a
distinctly dubious ginger, a guise which makes him seem at times more
child molester than doting dad.
The plot is simple. Reclusive woodcarver Martin discovers abandoned
baby on a cold winter's night. Mother has died in the snow. He adopts
the child, not knowing that its real father is the rich politician who
lives next door, Gabriel Bryne smouldering away as if he were cast as
Rhett Butler.
The years pass, a succession of highly talented child actresses play
the moppet, christened Matilda, until Gabriel gets broody. Unable to
have children by his dreary Wasp wife, Laura Linney, he decides he wants
his illegitimate daughter and a very suspect custody case ensues.
Will Matilda opt for a life of luxury, or stay with poor, but honest
Steve and his dumb shopkeeper friend, Catherine O'Hara, who may now
become more than a chum? Since nobody carries the remotest conviction it
is hard to care.
Mackinnon has handled the material as well as anybody could, and the
result passes the time harmlessly enough, although the incessant
signalling by Cliff Eidleman's score of how one is expected to feel does
become wearing. The truth is cobblers should stick to their lasts.
One of Mackinnons's television films, The Grass Arena is the film he
will dissect in his contribution to the scene-by-scene series in which
film-makers look at their work. It is based on the book by John Healey,
a down-and-out reformed by playing chess.
This chance to see the film on the big screen in advance of the
lecture is worth seizing.
The New Zealand star, Sam Neill, has made a fascinating
documentary, Cinema of Unease, about his homeland. Although not born
there, he was brought up there and he has used the country's cinema to
present his view of a society trying to find an identity of its own as
it has slowly emerged from the chains of empire.
He presents a society which is violent, obsessed with convention,
resentful of its links with Britain, striving to find a Polynesian
identity.
Although New Zealand is very different from Australia, both
country's have the British heritage to come to terms with and Neill's
film makes interesting viewing when taken with Michael Blakemore's
Australian version of Uncle Vanya -- Country Life -- in which Neill also
stars. Maybe somebody will play the two together some time.
Neill's use of clips from a vast range of New Zealand films is
inspired and the result is a picture of the country which the tourist
board may hate, but which is infinitely more intriguing than scenic
beauty could be. There may be serpents in Eden, but they are interesting
serpents.

IT was a pity about the Schumann and, to a lesser extent, a pity about
the Poulenc. These were not composers to whose songs, at this particular
point in his career, the winner of the 1991 Cardiff Lieder Prize seemed
able to bring qualities to equal those he displayed in Rachmaninov and
Ibert.
Indeed, Neal Davies sounded in some respects so out of touch with
Schumann's Opus 39 Liederkreis songs that you wondered why he had chosen
to devote the first half of his morning recital to them. But perhaps it
was not all his fault. Singers new to the Queen's Hall do not always
find its acoustics amenable to their voices. Moreover he had Iain
Burnside's heavy, cumbersome accompaniments to contend with, but
Davies's way of pecking and snapping at the notes (rendering many
shorter, quieter ones disconcertingly inaudable) was presumably his own
decision, as was his way of verging upon (and at one point crossing
into) the alien world of sprechgesang.
For the most part, this did Schumann's songs nothing but damage,
though in Mondnacht, at least, he caught something of the music's veiled
lyricism, as he also did in Wolf's Anakreons Grab. Where his baritone
voice was heard to infinitely better effect, however, was in the
grotesquerie of two little-known Rachmaninov songs, showing the composer
in his most laconic and sardonic vein.
With these and a pair of Dargomyzhky settings as evidence, Russian
song looks like becoming one of Davies's specialities. And the finesse
he brought to Ibert's four Don Quixote songs suggested that he may soon
have more to tell us about Poulenc Le Bestiaire than he did on this
occasion.

GHK have recruited the extra long arm of the law to assist them in
their fight back to the top flight of Scottish rugby. The club announced
last night that Cecil du Plessis, a 6ft 7ins, 18[1/2]-stone South
African lock, will add his considerable bulk to the Old Anniesland
playing resources.
Du Plessis, 24, a detective with the fraud squad in Port Elizabeth
where he plays for the local constabulary, has turned out seven times
for Eastern Province 'A' and 11 times for the Eastern Province 'B' side.
GHK, 1993-94 Division Two champions, have not had their troubles to
seek in recent times but, according the club president James Martin,
they are determined to bounce back from adversity and win promotion from
the reconstituted Division II to the premiership top flight.
The arrival of du Plessis is timely in view of the long-term groin
injury suffered by Scotland lock Shade Munro, who is now said to be
recovering after surgery but unlikely to participate in the league
campaign.
GHK have also secured the services of centre/wing Henry Feaunati from
Clarkston and centre Ian Macarthur from Kelso, the Poynder Park man
taking up a PE teaching post at Lomond School, Helensburgh.
The Old Anniesland club also announced that Walter Malcolm has
postponed his impending retirement, Andy Ness is back in harness after a
long lay-off through injury, and that winger Graeme Agnew is fit and
raring to go after a North American tour with the British Police side.
GHK will send a squad to Belfast this weekend for a four-way training
stint with Instonians, Malone, and Skerries.
* PROMISING prop Alan Kittle has resigned as captain of
Stewart's-Melville FP. Stew-Mel director of rugby Finlay Calder said
yesterday that the captaincy had been relinquished at Kittle's request
and he had not been sacked. Centre Les Hamilton will lead the Premier
Division II side.

* NOTHING brings out vagueness and confusion in a debate like the term
Popular Culture. This became apparent in Monday's TLS discussion at the
Book Festival when Waldemar Januszczak, head of arts of Channel 4,
pitched an audience question to Nick Hornby and Jonathan Coe. He wanted
to know whether the authors of Fever Pitch and What a Carve Up! saw
themselves producing examples of Popular Culture or just writing
literature about it.
In the chair, Mark Lawson set himself earnestly and hopelessly to the
task of coming up with a definition, and referred to the wisdom of
ex-Sun editor, Kelvin Mackenzie. The great tabloid hack once jibed that
broadsheet journalism represents ''Unpopular culture''. So we may take
from this that Hornby and Coe write Popular Culture only to the extent
that they sell a lot of books.
The debate didn't work not just because no one defined what Popular
Culture was, but because they didn't say what it wasn't. The idea that
there is a small establishment cotterie which holds sway over a central
culture while the rest of it rudely demands attention by force of
popularity produces a weirdly unreal picture of the whole system.
The way a superficial conception of popularity, combined with
references to bizarre marketing forces, distorts the cultural picture
was exposed that same afternoon by Liz Calder and Robert Gottlieb. As
major publishers of serious books who have suffered the effects of a
shrinking market, they have a knife-edge understanding of the battle
between quality and easy consumability. This is, after all, the real
polarisation in contemporary culture.
They discussed the necessity of maintaining an integrity of taste in
publishing.
Calder discovered Salmond Rushdie because he was her landlord. But his
first novel, Grimus, was a flop. Gottlieb published Rushdie in America
despite thinking there was no readership for books about India. The rest
is history.
Working out what is popular or elitist, or elite but populist, or
popular without being populist, should clearly be left up to the
soundbite merchants.
In the meantime the Book Festival has thrown up some more gems.
Yesterday afternoon Louis de Bernieres read with the kind of delight
which gives literary agility the good names of comedy and
internationalism. He is a well travelled writer who eschews the
temptations of glib cosmopolitanism. He pointed out that he wasn't
actually born in Jordan but the Woolwich military hospital in South
London.
His charm and intelligence produced one of those rare discussions in
which personal questions sat well with literary ones. He is someone
whose popularity is growing at the same rate as estimations of his
quality.

RECORD tonnage handled by the ports of Liverpool and the Medway helped
Mersey Docks and Harbour Company report a 6% increase in half-year
profits yesterday.
In the six months to end-June, pre-tax profits rose to #16.8m from
#15.9m in the first half of last year.
Containers handled at Liverpool increased by 22% and group tonnage
increased by 5.5% to 15.7 million tonnes.
The profit increase was achieved despite a #1.9m operating loss from
Eurolink Ferries, a successor to the Olau Line ferry service. The group
reckons losses in the second half from the operation will be sharply
lower.
Shareholders are to receive an increased interim dividend payout of
3.65p against 3.3p on earnings per share up to 12.56p from 11.72p.

HIGHER newspaper prices and advertising revenue and the sale of part
of its stake in BSkyB helped News International to more than double
pre-tax profits to #779m in the year to June.
Operating profits of the British arm of Rupert Murdoch's Sydney,
Australia-based News Corporation were 27% ahead at #122m, with the sale
of 10% of the satellite broadcaster to reduce the holding to 40%
bringing in an additional #410m.
Again the tax bill is minimal at just #8.3m. This means that in the
last four years, News International has amassed total pre-tax profits of
#1349m and paid just #14.7m in tax, the result of prior year tax losses.
It is paying a total dividend for the year of 3.24p, up from 1.44p.
News Corporation's own profits were ahead 11% at A$1340m (#640m),
helped by the British contribution and a good performance from the Fox
television interests in the US.
Overall group newspaper profits were 11% higher at the equivalent of
#233m, despite a dull experience in Australia, while the UK contribution
was 9% ahead at #156m.

ENGLAND'S Gary Wolstenholme yesterday realised a lifetime ambition
when his selection was announced for the Britain and Ireland team to
meet the United States in the Walker Cup match at Royal Porthcawl on
September 9 and 10 -- to follow in the footsteps of his late father,
Guy, who played in the matches twice, in 1957 and again two years later.
The only other such dynastic succession concerned Joe Carr, who played
in 10 matches over two decades beginning in 1947, and Roddy, who outdid
his father as a member of the victorious 1971 side. By coincidence, the
twelfth player to be chosen also in an Irishman, Jody Fanagan, an
established internationlist, as is Wolstenholme.
Both players were in the original squad of 23 -- only Scotland's
Graham Rankin has made his way into the team from outside the charmed
circle -- and confirmed their places with recent results. Wolstenholme
won the inaugural mid-amateur title on Sunday and Fanagan won the South
of Ireland title then reached the semi-finals of the close championship
last week.
Wolstenhlome, an insurance salesman who was 35 on Monday, won the
Amateur Championship in 1991, the week after the Portmarnock match and
missed the Interlachen encounter in 1993, a blessing in disguise,
perhaps, since the combined side suffered its heaviest defeat since the
number of foursomes and singles was doubled from 12 to 24 and their
length halved from 36 holes to 18.
Fanagan, aged 30, is a Dublin undertaker and comes from a well-known
sporting family. His father is a former chairman of Ireland's rugby
selection committee, his mother represented her country at hockey, and
his sister, Suzanne, is a current golf internationalist. Fanagan,
himself, came into golf comparatively late, having abandoned a promising
rugby career as a full back.
There is bound to be disappointment in Wales that although the country
supplies the captain, Clive Brown, no player will be in the side for the
first Walker Cup match to be held in The Principality. The nearest any
has come to making the team is Craig Evans, and he is only second
reserve, behind another Irishman, Keith Nolan.
Indeed, one of these two places, if not one on the team itself, might
well have gone to Simon Mackenzie, whose consistency in the early events
of the season evidently bloomed too late with his victories within a
week in the Scottish championship and the Leven Gold Medal. In these
matters, as Mackenzie, like Wolstenholme before him, has discovered,
timing is of the essence.
Meanwhile, the opposition's forces have begun to take shape. Half of
the American 10-man side has been nominated and the other half will be
determined after the US amateur championship, which began yesterday at
the Newport Country Club, Rhode Island, has been completed with its
36-hole final on Sunday.
The defending champion, Tiger Woods, aged 19, and his predecessor,
John Harris, 43, will be joined by Notah Begay, 22, the first native
American to be selected since the match began in 1922, another college
golfer in Alan Bratton, 23, and Tim Jackson, aged 36, the US Mid-Amateur
champion. The captain is Downing Gray, aged 56, who played in the match
three times in the 1960s. The Britain and Ireland team, with ages, is:
Jody Fanagan (Milltown), 30; Mark Foster (Worksop), 20; Stephen
Gallacher (Bathgate), 20; Padraig Harrington (Stackstown), 23; Barclay
Howard (Cochrane Castle), 42; David Howell (Broome Manor), 20; Lee James
(Broadstone), 22; Graham Rankin (Palacerigg), 29; Gordon Sherry
(Barassie), 21; and Gary Wolstenholme (Bristol and Clifton), 35.
Reserves - 1, Keith Nolan (Bray); 2, Craig Evans (West Monmouth).
Non-playing captain -- Clive Brown.

Gotu Itrottarfelag 2, Raith Rovers 2; Aggregate: 2-6
RAITH Rovers clinched a place in the first round of the UEFA Cup
despite an unconvincing draw with Gotu IF in the Faroe Islands last
night.
Goals from Danny Lennon and Stevie Crawford gave the Scots a result
which, combined with their 4-0 first-leg win set them up for a possible
glamour tie in Friday's draw.
But goals from brothers Henning and Magni Jarnskor will have caused
some concern among the Rovers management, who would have hoped to
prevent the amateurs from breaching a defence which will face much
sterner tests in the season ahead.
The Raith players spent most of the day sleeping but an hour-long
journey on the winding roads from Torshaven to the Toftir Stadium shook
some of the cobwebs off and the pre-game warm-up at the wind-swept
cliff-top pitch -- surely Europe's most remote stadium -- helped to put
some life into the travel-weary Scots.
They were joined in this tiny footballing outpost in the middle of the
North Atlantic by around 100 Rovers supporters, including a brave pair
who pitched their tent outside the stadium.
Rovers kicked off hoping to put the strong wind at their backs to good
use and were immediately on the attack, Tony Rougier driving down the
right and full back Julian Broddle finding room on the opposite flank.
With barely three minutes on the clock Davie Kirkwood sent Danny
Lennon free on the right and his cross found Ally Graham on his own six
yards out but he headed wide.
Colin Cameron also headed wide and Scotland under-21 player Crawford
passed up on a couple of chances.
Gotu suffered a blow when Faroese internationalist Pauli Jarnskor was
stretchered off with a knee injury after 12 minutes.
But the part-timers almost created a shock eight minutes later, Simun
Justinussen just volleying wide.
Raith were spurred on by that momentary defensive lap, Colin Cameron
firing a 25-yard right foot shot just over the bar.
Lennon also came close with a well-hit volley which slipped just wide
and the same player had a free kick deflected for a corner from which
Cameron blasted the ball over the bar.
Jimmy Nicholl's men appeared to put themselves firmly on the road to
the next round just two minutes later.
Lennon intercepted a pass by Alvi Justinussen and clipped his shot
over keeper Jens Martin Knudsen.
Rougier missed a sitter after 56 minutes, blasting the ball high and
wide from a yard out.
The Fifers paid for that miss when Gotu grabbed an equaliser after 78
minutes, Henning Jarnskor rising to head a corner from his brother,
Magni, into the net.
Rovers hit back within three minutes, however, when Graham knocked
down a Kirkwood free-kick and Crawford was hand to crash the ball into
the roof of the net from close range.
But the last word went to the home team when, with three minutes
remaining, Magni Jarnskor broke through the defence and sent the ball
past Scott Thomson.
GOTU IF -- Knudsen, A Justinussen, H Jarnskor, Rasmussen, Tvorfoss,
Olsen, M Jarnskor, P Jarnskor, S Jusinussen, Petersen, R Justinussen.
Substitutes -- Joensen, Mikkelsen, Ennigard, Heinason, Hansen.
RAITH ROVERS -- Thomson, Kirkwood, Broddle, Lennon, Dennis, Sinclair,
Rougier, Graham, Crawford, Taylor, Cameron. Substitutes -- Raeside,
Forrest, Robertson, Fridge, McKinlay.
Referee -- A C Howells (Wales).

MEDICAL dosage systems to high-speed X-ray monitor engineer Graseby is
''itching with frustration'', according to chairman John Jackson, writes
ANDREW WILSON.
It hopes to hear in October whether it has won a major contract for
chemical warfare detection kits for the American Abrams tank, the
spin-off being that once one Nato member has bought it, the rest will
almost certainly follow.
That would ensure a stable source of earnings for at least five years,
although at present defence is just 15% of the business.
Its 9000 series of portable measured drug dispensers, which allow the
patient to remain fully mobile while receiving a controlled and
continuous dosage of painkiller, should get US official approval before
the year ends. Graseby is a worldleader in this sector. Meanwhile, the
CDX high-speed X-ray machine used for detecting food impurities will see
sales rise from 10 units to 120 units next year at #50,000 a time.
It is the potential of these developments, which also include narcotic
drug detectors and semtex sniffers -- that may now have huge sales scope
in the US -- which is more important than the bare half-time results.
These showed pre-tax profits rising 8% to #5.37m. The medical division
benefited from strong NHS business, although increasingly growth will
come from overseas. However, the environmental side suffered from a
downturn in US business. This was because the surge in demand from
utilities to measure air particle contaminants from power stations came
to an end and there is no legislation in hand to generate new activity.
Graseby achieved a sales margin of 14% against its long-term target of
15% in the half-year to June on turnover 5% down at #45.1m.
Full-year profits seem likely to rise #1.5m or so to #11.5m, where the
shares at 147p sell at under 12-times probable earnings and offer
substantial growth potential on a two-year view.
The interim dividend has been held at 2.7p, but there could be a small
increase in the total to 6.8p for a 5.8% yield.

In Larnaca
RANGERS will unfurl the premier-division championship flag at Ibrox on
Saturday before the match against Kilmarnock.
Normally, it would be a triumphant occasion and another demonstration
of Rangers' domestic superiority, but the reaction of the club's
supporters will depend very much on what happens here tonight.
The ridiculously unjust system of having to play matches of such
significance for players, managers, clubs, and fans before the ball has
started rolling in earnest at the end of the close season again has
helped manoeuvre Rangers into a precarious position.
The sight of a seventh successive championship flag fluttering at the
top of a pole will not be sufficient to satisfy the customers who demand
and, in fact, deserve better return for their money than an annual trip
into Europe.
These people want Champions League football, yet their team's interest
in the biggest club tournament in the history of the game could be over
before the league season has even begun.
Walter Smith's team will not face a more important match this season
than the one which they will go into this evening.
Two weeks ago at Ibrox, the Rangers players experienced a kind of
pre-match fear previously unknown, and their work against Anorthosis
Famagusta was below par.
Also, and probably significantly, Brian Laudrup, who is unavailable
this time because of injury, did not perform and neither did Paul
Gascoigne, who must this evening produce something special for the
cause, whether or not the fitness experts say he is ready to assume the
dominant role.
However, does he and do the others really know what is at stake
tonight? If they do, and if they channel their anxieties properly, they
will beat Anorthosis even though the Cypriot champions have been growing
in confidence.
If the implications of this match have flown over players' heads, then
everything Rangers' chairman David Murray has been working towards will
be delayed another year, and he is wise enough to realise that chances
to join Europe's elite won't continue to present themselves.
Perhaps it would help to put all of this in perspective by pointing
out that Rangers are believed to be on #25,000 a man to qualify for the
Champions League, while Anorthosis, a refugee team from the Turkish part
of the island, are being offered #3000 each to win the biggest match any
of them have ever played.
Their best players, the three Bulgarians Ilian Kiriakov, Nikolai
Todorov, and Valentin Ignatov, and the Serbian, Sinima Gogic -- now a
Cypriot citizen -- each earn no more than #6000 a month, although they
have other perks such as assistance with housing. They and their
team-mates, who work mornings to supplement their earnings, form a
small-time team playing out of a humble, spartan ground, the Antonis
Papadopoulous Stadium.
The odds are against them and they know it, but then they are
accustomed to overcoming difficulties.
They had to flee Famagusta in 1974 when the Turks attacked and stole
their land and homes and when they settled in Larnaca they almost went
under. There seemed little point in continuing, but pride made them
build again, hence the phoenix on their club crest and their name,
Anorthosis, which means rising or reviving.
''We are not afraid of this tie,'' their coach, Georgi Vassilev, said
yesterday, ''but there are always players in the opposition on whom you
must keep an eye.''
That was a clear enough statement of intent to mark Gascoigne tightly
again, and while that wasn't a surprise, Vassilev then bemused everyone
by saying he was disappointed Laudrup was not here.
''We knew what he could do, but now we might be faced with someone
about whom we are not sure and that could cause problems defensively for
us,'' he explained.
Smith knows the score and he must strive to get his tactics correct
and consider whether or not to play Charlie Miller or even Ian Durrant,
who has a fine pedigree in European play, in midfield where Anorthosis
are capable of holding the ball.
Smith must also look to Gordan Petric, who can pass the ball
accurately and build moves from the back.
However, no matter which players he selects, each one must understand
and accept his responsibilities and they must all play with the kind of
passion and fierce determination to win which Anorthosis will employ.

NEW Zealand full back Glen Osborne, centre Walter Little, and forward
Glen Larsen yesterday joined the bulk of their All Black team-mates in
signing contracts pledging them to the New Zealand Rugby Football Union.
Osborne and Little had both been approached by rugby league clubs,
with Little rejecting a lucrative offer from Australian team Perth
Western Reds. ''I'm enjoying the game so much this year I just want to
keep playing,'' said Little, a key member of the New Zealand team who
reached the World Cup final in South Africa.
Osborne said a number of factors swayed his decision to stick with
rugby following the collapse of plans for a rebel international series
under the umbrella of the World Rugby Corporation. ''One fact that swung
me back towards rugby was the fact that the players were coming together
with the rugby union. Another thing was the fact that the WRC business
was settled,'' he said.

A GOLD vaulted ceiling rises dramatically from the floor but despite
the glimpsed ornate splendour of the Spanish court this is a place of
dark, brooding intent and Philip Prowse's open set is framed by glossy
black walls. These conceal a multitude of doors which allow the
continual stream of exaggerated exits and entrances, exacerbating the
air of cloak and dagger intrigue at large, if occasionally with a
farcical edge which leavens the otherwise somewhat overpoweringly
serious tone of this play by the eighteenth-century German dramatist
Friedrich Schiller, a playwright both neglected and undervalued in
Britain.
Robert David MacDonald's attentions should do much to redress this;
his translation for this Citizens' Theatre Company production is an
intensely vital one, bubbling with life, with love, with terror.
Reproducing the rhythms of Schiller's blank verse he yet updates the
text with twentieth-century idioms and witty flourishes.
Prowse's direction not only allows a thorough exposition of Schiller's
thematic preoccupation with the battle for individual freedom, realised
here through his dramatisation of the conflict between the tyrannical
Philip II of Spain and his only son, Carlos, it also cradles finely
nuanced performances from an outstanding cast, with attention to an
irony which keeps potential melodrama in check.
Carlos could be the archetypal tragic hero, in thrall to romantic
impulse -- the doomed love of his father's young wife -- were it not for
a headstrong nature verging on mental instability, Benedick Bates
revelling in a quixotic performance. No, it is his friend, the Marquis
of Posa (Andrew Woodall), who embodies Schiller's humanist ideal,
willing to sacrifice all for his fellow man.
This is most clearly seen in the enthralling dialogue between Posa and
the King, where the young man courageously disputes his sovereign's
despotic campaign in Flanders. It is a scene of thrilling dramatic
tension, Woodall brilliantly radiant and Giles Havergal ruthlessly
dignified as a King who has learnt sickening cruelty.
In the fifth act Prowse unleashes a stagecraft which will have you on
the edge of your seat, with a striking tableau which expresses the full
potent horror of the age of the Inquisition. Carlos is finally ennobled
through sacrifice, Bates visibly and movingly growing in stature and
strength as the golden ceiling, the weight of the establishment, presses
down.

MyPa-47 0, Motherwell 2
Aggregate 3-3 (MyPa win on away goals rule)
NOBODY hands out prizes for second place in football but Motherwell at
least deserve immense credit for coming so close to breaking a 40-year
jinx that had haunted Scottish teams in Europe.
Down 3-1 from the first leg of this UEFA Cup preliminary tie, the Fir
Park team almost achieved what no Scots team has ever done, win a tie
after losing the first game at home. They came within one goal of
succeeding and were unlucky not to be coming home conquering heroes.
They had proved themselves a far better team than My-Pa, who were
hugely relieved to hear the final whistle which signalled their
aggregate win on the away goals rule.
Alex Burns, replacing the injured Tommy Coyne, scored the opening goal
in 28 minutes, and when Dougie Arnott added a second with 21 minutes to
go, the chances of a historic evening became serious.
However, the final climb to the top of this particular mountain proved
just a little too much for the Lanarkshire team. They gave it their best
shot, but they will never forgive themselves for their performance in
the first leg.
Yet if 17-year-old Lee McCulloch, in his first season as a youth
training player, had been inches inside the post with a last minute
shot, this would have been a much different tale to tell.
Manager Alex McLeish was philosophical afterwards. ''The damage was
done two weeks ago,'' he said. ''I knew we were a better team and we
could put on a better show than we did at Fir Park, but the objective is
to get through over two legs.
''I am proud of our players for retrieving a bit of pride and
confidence. I thought young Lee had scored in the last minute and
certainly they were a worried team by then.''
When they took the field in the Saviniemi, Motherwell must have
wondered how they contrived to lose by two goals at home to a team whose
park would represent no more than a good junior ground in Scotland.
With a crowd close to 4000 on site, MyPa-47 were playing to a record
audience, another statistic which made the first leg result seem unreal.
However, when they got down to business, Motherwell showed admirable
signs of re-establishing at least some of the reputation they had lost
at home, despite the fact that Billy Davies and Andy Roddie were booked
for fouls inside the first quarter of an hour.
In one smart move, Davies might have done better than shoot past, but
Roddie did have the ball in the net following a pass from Dolan.
Unfortunately, he was judged offside.
The danger of losing concentration, which caused Motherwell so much
bother in the first game, was re-emphasised when Koskinen's free kick
found Hyypia, whose side-foot shot went just outside a post.
Keeper Scott Howie saved the day a little later when he dived to make
a marvellous stop from Kautenon, whose fierce shot looked a certain
goal. Motherwell were lucky, too, that Keskitalo smashed the rebound
over the bar.
In 28 minutes, however, Motherwell were feeling much happier with
themselves when they scored the goal that raised hopes among their
hundred or so fans in the stadium. Roddie was sent clear on the right by
a Lambert pass which was missed by the full back, and when he laid the
ball carefully in front of Burns, the striker knocked it over the line.
Howie, who had done a stalwart job in goal, made another fine save
from a Gronholm shot, but then Roddie missed a golden chance to put his
team two up. The Finnish defence fiddled about once too often and when
Arnott slipped the ball to Roddie inside the box a second goal seemed
likely, but the ex-Aberdeen man's left-foot effort slid outside a post.
Keskitalo was booked early in the second half for a foul on Martin,
perhaps a sign that MyPa were getting nervous.
When the ball broke to Davies, his shot was stopped by Jakonen but
then ran through the keeper's legs before he was relieved to recapture
it.
The Finns increasingly tried to find ways of slowing the game down, or
waste time, but the feeling persisted that if Motherwell could score
again, the ''impossible dream'' could become a reality. In 69 minutes
they did score. Roddie provided the pass for Arnott to place the ball
out of Jakonen's reach.
With seven minutes left Motherwell put on McCulloch for Roddie to add
fresh legs for the final push. But it was Howie who was the immediate
hero when he dived to push away a Kolkka shot.
The Finns made two substitutions to waste time, but it very nearly
backfired, when Motherwell's substitute, McCulloch, went agonisingly
close to scoring the goal that would have done the job, hitting his
right-foot shot past the goalkeeper but just outside the far post.
MY-PA 47 -- Jakonen, Huttunen, Viljanen, Hyypia, Koskinen, Mahlio,
Gronholm, Kautonen, Tiainen, Kolkka, Keskitalo. Substitutes -- Vuorinen,
Hellsten, Koskinen, Lindstrom, Pohja.
MOTHERWELL -- Howie, May, McKinnon, Roddie, Martin, McCart, Lambert,
Dolan, Burns, Arnott, Davies. Substitutes -- McSkimming, Philliben,
Ritchie, McCulloch, Woods.
Referee -- S Kjvelbrott (Norway).

Washington, Tuesday -- The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady
today amid signs that the economy is recovering from its brush with
recession earlier this year.
The decision by the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market
Committee had been widely expected after it cut rates last month for the
first time in nearly three years.
''The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 12.25pm,'' Fed
spokesman Joseph Coyne said in a brief statement. ''There is no further
announcement.''
Most analysts though are betting that it is only a matter of time
before the central bank eases credit again to give the economy a helping
hand as it heads into 1996.
Since the Fed trimmed a key short-term interest rate by a
quarter-percentage point on July 6, the economy generally has been
looking better.
Housing starts saw their biggest gain in more than a year last month,
rising 6.7% on the back of lower interest rates and cheaper mortgages.
The jobs market has shown some signs of improvement. Fewer Americans
are filing claims for jobless benefits and employment is up so far this
summer.
Most analysts -- inside and outside the Fed -- expect the economy to
strengthen in the current quarter, after growth abruptly slowed to a
mere 0.5% in the second quarter. -- Reuter.

IN every sense, this is a refreshing event! For while the company
dance, sing and deliver apposite quotations -- all celebrating tea, of
course -- the audience are given an assortment of classy cuppas.
The Fynaesthetes -- themselves a highly characterful blend -- want us
to perceive their performance with senses other than the standard
hearing and seeing. Inhaling and savouring the significant qualities of
Earl Grey or Rose Pouchong -- each tea carefully atuned to a particular
scene -- will, it's hoped, enhance our enjoyment of the production.
In fact, the company are thoroughly entertaining in themselves. Still,
it's an engaging concept, carried off with great style -- enough,
almost, to make this life-long coffee drinker turn over a new leaf.

AIRDRIE striker Alan Lawrence has asked the club for the opportunity
of playing in the premier division, saying that, after six years with
the Lanarkshire side, a move to Hearts is no more than he deserves.
Lawrence has been the subject of recent transfer speculation. But
neither a straight cash offer of #35,000 from Hearts' manager Jim
Jefferies or a proposed player exchange with Scott Leitch has put the
final detail on a deal.
Now Jefferies is trying to tempt Diamonds manager Alex MacDonald with
a player-plus-cash package which Lawrence finally hopes will do the
trick, especially as he passed up the chance to join Partick Thistle on
Friday.
''As soon as I knew Hearts were interested it was a possibility that I
felt needed every consideration,'' said Lawrence. ''I was 33 on
Saturday, and at this stage there will be few more chances to try my
hand with a top premier division club.
''I've given Airdrie the best six years of my career and felt that the
contract I turned down in the summer, didn't reflect that.''
* EVERTON hope to have Andre Kanchelskis signed and registered in time
to play in their Premiership match against Southampton this weekend.
A compromise looks to have been reached without the deal having to go
to arbitration after Manchester United agreed to reopen talks with
Kanchelskis's former Russian club Shaktyor Donesk, who are claiming 30%
of the #5m fee.
Everton director Cliff Finch, who has been at the centre of
negotiations, said: ''It's a lot of weight off our shoulders and a time
for rejoicing, a time for celebrating the final piece in Joe Royle's
jigsaw for this season. That's what we want; Andre in a blue shirt.''
The Russian international winger has been training alone after the
collapse of the move and the FA have already started the arbitration
process.
''Everton have gone as far as we can in this affair,'' said Finch.
There will be meetings between the Russian club and Manchester United
over the next 48 hours. I think the other two parties will see sense and
have it sorted by the end of the week.''
* DUNDEE United will again be without Maurice Malpas and David Hannah
when they face Stranraer at Stair Park tonight in the League Challenge
Cup, allowing the pair extra time to recover from injury before
Saturday's Division 1 match with Dunfermline at East End Park.
But there is some good news for United fans with striker Scott Crabbe
likely to play his first competitive game of the season after shaking
off a hamstring problem.
Meanwhile, United have released teenage midfield player Brian Burns,
who now is expected to continue his senior career with Hamilton.
* DUNDEE defender Dusan Vrto has signed a one-month contract and is
now likely to have more talks with manager Jim Duffy regarding his
future.
* THE English FA have announced that Colombia, with Fredy Rincon,
Carlos Valderama, and Leeds' #4m target Faustino Asprilla, will provide
the opposition to England at Wembley next week.
Terry Venables' side was due to meet Croatia, but their visit was
postponed on Saturday because of fighting in the Balkans.
''I'm very pleased to get a team of such quality at short notice,''
said coach Venables. They are one of the strongest teams in South
America and will be a real challenge. It is a good way to kick off the
season.''
* TERRY Butcher has emerged as the front-runner for the position as
manager of first division Dumbarton. It is believed Butcher has already
been sounded out and the reply was sufficiently positive to enable the
Boghead board to consider opening talks.
Butcher spent a period as a player last season with Clydebank to help
them during an injury-hit spell.

PAUL Gascoigne, Rangers' record signing, took a Garbo-like view of the
world yesterday as the Scottish champions prepared for their European
Cup preliminary round game against Anorthosis Famagusta of Cyprus.
The #4.3m purchase fro Lazio, whose bleached locks have been copied by
thousands of Ibrox supporters, decided against speaking to the media.
His decision came after he claimed that he had been hounded by the
tabloid press since his arrival in Glasgow. ''I went for years in Rome
not speaking to the press because of similar things.
''I am ready to do the same here for a month and if I'm allowed to
have a private life, then I will talk again. I'm being blamed for so
many things that it has become ridiculous. I cannot have a meal without
photographers around and that is no way to live.''
It is hard not to feel sympathy for the player. When Rangers players
went out together for a pre-season lunch to allow Gascoigne to meet up
with his team-mates in social surroundings, the restaurant in Glasgow
was besieged by photographers.
This has happened repeatedly and now Gascoigne, the most high-profile
player at Ibrox, has decided enough is enough.

GIVEN the major rationalisation moves which have already taken place
at Thorn EMI, the market can be forgiven for some initial confusion over
the first-quarter results. The share price see-sawed before finally
settling on a 6p gain to 1439p, not far short of its high for the year.
Even chairman Sir Colin Southgate felt constrained to caution against
extrapolating the growth rate to the year-end. But he did add that the
company's performance leads it to anticipate another good year.
The results reflect the elimination of Rumbelows' losses following the
closure of the white goods chain, the impact of the consolidation of
Toshiba-EMI on EMI Music's results, and the effect of the acquisition of
Dillons on HMV's results.
Still to come is the really big one, the proposed demerger of the
group's music interests, including HMV, and household rental businesses.
A final decision on this is expected by early next year, but the market
assumption is that this will get the go-ahead. US entertainment
predators are expected to be attracted to EMI Music, the world's
third-largest record company, in what is generally seen as a buoyant
market.
The Thorn rental business, though, is thought unlikely to attract the
same attention, at least in the short term.
That, however, is for 1996 if all goes well. Meanwhile, the combined
group's first quarter shows a 31.5% rise in operating profits before tax
and exceptional charges from #45.7m to #60.1m, perhaps a shade below
best market hopes but difficult to interpret in the circumstances.
The EMI Music division increased profits by 20% to #39.6m but this, of
course, includes full consolidation of Toshiba-EMI. After restating the
1994 first quarter to reflect this full consolidation, the advance in
sales falls from 32.5% to 8.7%, and the rise in profits to 10.6%. The
return on sales improved from 7.2% to 7.4%.
Around half of Thorn's 42.4% increase in operating profit represented
organic growth, after excluding the impact of exchange and the removal
of Rumbelows' losses of #6m for the same period last year. Trading
remains difficult in both the UK and the US, the two main markets for
this operation. But while this has hit volumes there has been an
improvement in profit margins, the overall return on sales rising to
10.2% in the quarter against 9.6% last year after stripping Rumbelows
out of the equation.
HMV, which now includes the Dillons book chain, former flagship of the
crashed Pentos group which Thorn EMI swiftly purchased from the
receiver, enjoyed a strong first quarter. Sales have surged by 65.1% to
#145m. And compared with the same period last year, like-for-like
revenues from the music stores were up 6.9% on a worldwide basis and
13.6% ahead for the UK alone. Dillons saw like-for-like sales rise 3.6%.
The seasonal loss at HMV rose from #3.4m to #7.1m, but this was in
line with expectations and reflected the increased number of store
openings and the losses, also seasonal, at Dillons for the first time.
Looking to the rest of the year, the chairman's optimism that the
group is in line for a good one should, in itself, be enough to prop up
the share price so long as there is no general collapse in the FTSE-100
index. But the prospect of a long-awaited demerger must also whet the
appetite, though clearly this must already, at least in part, be already
built into the share price.
BZW has estimated that on a stand-alone basis EMI and HMV are worth
#4400m to #4800m if demerged. But, unless EMI was to enter into some
sort of strategic alliance to try to block any bid, its worth in an
actual bid situation could be #5700m to #6400m.

ALASTAIR McCoist, who has spent the last week creating fresh records,
will be unleashed against Anorthosis Famagusta in the European Cup
preliminary round, second leg in Cyprus today.
He spent the first leg in frustration on the bench. Now, after his
recent feat, he is ready for one of the most important matches of his
career.
Two weeks ago, Rangers manager Walter Smith left the player on the
bench in the opening-leg game. Even now, McCoist, who admits to having
been frustrated then, agrees that he is not as fit as he wants to be.
''I think I'm only 85% ready to play -- but I hope that can still be
enough as it has been in my last two games,'' said the striker.
For Scotland, McCoist returned after a two-and-a-half year absence to
score the goal which will almost certainly carry the team to the
European Championship finals. For Rangers at the weekend he scored his
300th goal for the club, setting a record.
Now there is another record in his sights, and within his grasp.
McCoist is top-joint scorer for the Scottish champions in European
competition, sharing a 12-goal total with Ralph Brand.
''This is perhaps the best time for me to score another goal in Europe
and create another record,'' added McCoist.
While Smith continues to fret over his injury problems, he knows that
McCoist, for one, is ready for this match which can decide so much of
the Ibrox club's future.
Last night, Smith still had problems over the fitness of Alan McLaren,
though it seems likely that Stuart McCall and Gordon Durie will play.
''I want to give Alan every chance of being ready,'' said Smith ''The
others look much more likely to play, but I am not naming a team. There
are several possibilities for me to think about.
''This is a difficult game, but we are a goal ahead, which some people
seem to forget.
''It might not be as simple for the Cypriots as they appear to think.
I believe that they will still be cautious and then, later, if we are
still in the same position -- in the lead -- then they will take chances
and we can exploit these openings which will become available to us.''
One of the players who will be expected to move in on the openings
that may be there is, of course, McCoist. ''It was frustrating to have
to sit on the bench in the first game,'' he said, ''but I know that I am
not yet fully match fit. I am getting there, getting closer, with every
game and I am ready for this one.
''I am ready to score, and ready to make another record.
''I know that people will simply expect it to happen. I suppose they
always do. But I can live with that because you have to when you are at
a club as big as Rangers.
''I scored my 300th goal for the club at the weekend, now I can beat
Ralph Brand's record in Europe and there is no doubt that this is the
time to do that. There cannot be a better time.
''I thought that they played particularly well at Ibrox. Maybe they
did better than they had hoped for, I doubt if they can play any better.
''But we can play better and we will play better. I thought in the
second half, when Gordon Durie went on, there were chances created and
we might have scored more goals.
''We are not even thinking of defeat. We recognise that to lose would
be a disaster for the club. But no-one in the dressing room is
contemplating that. Everyone is positive.
''Everyone is remembering the last time we were in the Champions'
League and remembering how good that was for everyone in the country.
''We want to be there again and we believe that we could do so.
''Paul Gascoigne will be expected to do well, but he is the kind of
player who responds to challenge. He has shown us that already and he
will accept the responsibility he has in this game.
''Obviously we are going to miss Brian Laudrup, but the squad is
strong, and strong enough to carry us through.''
I believe that McCoist can continue his streak of luck -- a streak
which has lasted almost throughout his career -- and that Rangers will
march on to the Champions' League.
The players around the team hotel appeared confident. None of them
were contemplating defeat.
They know they have suffered in the past but they know, too, that they
have done so because of the goals they have lost at home.
This time they are in the driving seat. One goal, just one, will be
enough to kill off the Cypriots.
And who would bet against McCoist scoring a goal which would give his
club untold millions of pounds and untold prestige?

FORTUNE was smiling on the Irish and ignoring the Scots in the
Teacher's Round Britain Challenge over the past 24 hours, as the 10-boat
fleet, in turn, unstuck themselves from a windless, Welsh coast and
headed north into the Irish Sea bound for Rothesay.
Ireland's David Harte, in Pride of Erin, consolidated his lead which
he has held since leading the Five Nations fleet across the Cardiff
start line on Sunday. The two-mile cushion he has enhanced is now over
the other Irish crew, Positively Belfast, skippered by Ulster's Dicky
Gomes.
The Scots pair, Lord Inverforth (Paul Jeffes) and Glendronach (Jon
Fitzgerald), were simply left during Monday night. While the Irish now
lie first and second, Fitzgerald slumped six places to eighth. Jeffes
lies tenth.
An inshore passage around Milford Haven did the Scots most damage.
Standings:
1, Dream of Erin (D Harte) Ireland 277 miles to Rothesay; 2,
Positively Belfast (D Gomes) Ireland 279; 3, Pride of Cardiff (R Tudor)
Wales 282; 4, Belle Helene (JP Saliou) France 289; 5, Celtic Dragon (C

Hamilton 2, Airdrie 2 (aet Hamilton won 4-3 on penalties)
HAMILTON snatched a dramatic win to remove Airdrie, the B&amp;Q Cup
holders, from this new-look tournament.
Airdrie pounded the home goal early in the game, and only superb saves
from David Cormack stood between Hamilton and a drubbing.
Airdrie seemed to have the tie stitched up nine minutes from time when
substitute Jimmy Boyle scored. But Hamilton, with seconds to go, forced
the game into extra time when Gary Clark headed in a Martin McIntosh
cross from close range.
Jim McIntyre lobbed home a Peter Duffield pass to put Airdrie ahead
after 100 minutes, and 11 minutes later, Clark equalised.
Sandy Stewart's spot kick was saved and McIntosh netted to put
Hamilton in front. John Davies, Marvin Wilson, and McIntyre scored for
Airdrie with Clark and McInulty scoring for Accies, while McEntegart's
kick was saved. When Cormack saved Boyle's effort it was left to Accies'
Dugald McCarrison to net the fourth and clinch the tie, which he did.
Six players were booked -- McKenzie, McEntegart, Sherry, and Clark for
Accies, and Black and Boyle of Airdrie.

East Fife 2, Dundee 4
A HAT trick from Jim Hamilton helped Dundee to victory at Bayview.
The striker netted his first just before half-time, with Ian Anderson
having already put Dundee ahead in 24 minutes. Robert Scott pulled a
goal back in 45 minutes, but the Fifers looked out of it within four
minutes of the second half as Dave Beaton was red-carded and Hamilton
grabbed his second goal of the night.
The Methil side hit back in 52 minutes when Scott netted his second
from close range, but Hamilton restored Dundee's two-goal advantage when
he scored from George Shaw's cross.

A WOMAN lies in the dark, listening to the scrabblings and cacklings
of unseen beings behind the wallpaper. Its yellowness oppresses,
depresses her. Her two-faced husband -- cunningly played by two men
together -- never listens to her, nor do the other members of this
grotesque household.
Her madness begins to take shape. The wallpaper bulges . . . a face,
hands, press against its surface. Then, through a seam in the paper,
there emerges this mercurial creature: innocent, childlike and yet
somehow utterly evil. The elemental waif is the incomparable Yvette
Bozsik -- the best reason possible for hie-ing to Dundee.
Together with Sacha Hails she has devised a compelling vision of
mental breakdown, its slewed perceptions made comical, tragic, and
sinister by turns. Nine others join her in dance that is eerie with
self-absorption, haunted with wild imaginings. One of the finest -- if
farthest-flung -- performances on the Fringe.

BRECHIN'S Gary Mearns put third division City through to the next
round of the Challenge Cup at the expense of first division Dumbarton,
thanks to a glorious strike after 17 minutes.
Stirling Albion midfielder Tommy Tait made it four goals in three
games as Kevin Drinkell's side cruised into the second round with a
comfortable 3-0 victory over Queen's Park at Forthbank.
Tait gave Albion the perfect start in the ninth minute when he curled
a 20-yard shot high into the net.
And he steered home a second in 31 minutes after frantic goalmouth
activity.
Two minutes after the break striker Steve McCormick put the result
beyond doubt when he powerfully headed McLeod's cross home.
Berwick Rangers' poor start to the season continued when following
their 7-0 defeat in the Coca-Cola Cup by Partick Thistle, they lost 2-1
to Montrose.
Tony Cole opened the scoring for Berwick after 17 minutes when he
headed home a Mark Cowan cross.
Montrose equalised four minutes after the restart when a MacRonald
free kick was headed into the path of Derek Grant, who made no mistake.
Three minutes from time, a cross from MacRonald was thundered into the
roof of the net by Paul Masson.
Third division East Stirlingshire were no match for first division St
Mirren, losing 3-0.
Saints went ahead on 24 minutes with a fine individual goal from Barry
Lavety. Six minutes later Alex Bone was brought down inside the penalty
area and Robert Dawson netted the penalty.
Lavety increased Saints' lead in 62 minutes.
A first-half double from striker Steve Kerrigan lit up Clydebank's 2-0
victory over third division Arbroath.
Clydebank went ahead after 19 minutes when Kerrigan side-footed home
after fine work by James Grady. And Grady also set up Kerrigan's second,
with another deep cross finding the tall striker.
Arbroath striker Charlie McLean, booked just seconds earlier, was red
carded in 52 minutes.
Caledonian Thistle were left rueing an array of fluffed chances as
they lost 2-1 at home to Alloa.
A second-half strike by Danny Divers was the difference in a frantic
tie at Telford Street.
Norman MacMillan put Thistle ahead in 36 minutes when he powered a
header home. It took just two minutes for Alloa to equalise -- Dave
Brennan cleared off the line, but the ball was whipped back in to give
Barrie Moffat an easy finish.
In 58 minutes, Divers poked a loose ball past a helpless MacRitchie.
A cracking 20-yard drive from Bobby Mann midway through the first half
was enough to give Forfar victory against Queen of the South at
Palmerston.

FOUR years after its rescue from the receiver, Blairs, the Greenock
window manufacturer, is celebrating its return to financial health with
a #1m export order for Canada.
The company pioneered the manufacture of double-swing windows that can
be cleaned on both sides without resort to a ladder, but it went into
receivership in 1991 after failing to make a heavy investment programme
pay its way.
CR Smith, the window manufacturer based in Cowdenbeath, Fife, bought
Blairs in November 1991 and has nursed it back to health.
The company was losing #400,000 a year on turnover of about #4m when
CR Smith took over. But in the financial year to September 1994 it
showed a profit of #700,000 on sales of #9m.
Now Blairs has landed a #1m contract to supply high-quality
timber-framed windows to refurbish the headquarters of Canada Life
Assurance in Toronto. It beat six North American rivals to clinch the
deal and a follow-up order worth #400,000.
Gerard Eadie, chairman of CR Smith, said Blairs got the Canadian
contract thanks to its local salesman James Darrah, a Greenock man who
emigrated to Toronto 28 years ago. He has been helping Blairs secure
sales there ever since and has built up the company's local reputation.
Now Mr Darrah is a full-time employee and about 15% of the company's
sales go to Canada.
Mr Eadie revived the fortunes of the Greenock joinery by integrating
its activities closely with those of CR Smith and putting in a new
management team.
The double-glazing units for the 641 special windows being delivered
to Canada Life are being manufactured by CR Smith in Cowdenbeath, with
Blairs providing the wooden frames.
CR Smith, which manufactures conservatories as well as steel and uPVC
windows in Cowdenbeath, sells #1m of Blairs' wooden windows per year
through its own outlets.
But much of Blairs' business comes through bulk orders from local
authorities and housing associations. ''We pick up orders worth about
#600,000 fairly frequently,'' Mr Eadie said.
The company, founded as a family-run business by James Blair, now
employs nearly 200, up from 139 when it was rescued from financial
collapse.
Its parent CR Smith has a steady turnover of #25m a year, but Mr Eadie
declined to reveal the level of profit, saying only that it was
satisfactory.
He said window sales had been hit by the downturn in the housing
market and the exceptionally hot summer, but the company continued to
record strong growth in conservatory sales, which are running at
#750,000 per month.
Mr Eadie pointed to conservatories as CR Smith's main potential growth
area and said the company may eventually make acquisitions to expand
this.

MIKE Atherton yesterday accepted the England captaincy for another six
months -- then dismissed suggestions that he is close to ''burn-out''.
Chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth confirmed Atherton's
reappointment for the winter tour of South Africa and World Cup campaign
in India and Pakistan on the eve of this season's deciding Test against
West Indies.
''Mike's had a great summer and he's the best man for the job,'' said
Illingworth, which -- from a hard-to-please Yorkshireman -- was high
praise indeed.
But Atherton's reaction came as even better news for English cricket
following fresh concern over his suspect back and suggestions from
Lancashire coach David Lloyd that he needs gentle handling.
''I'm keen to stress that I'm not washed out,'' he said. ''We play a
lot of tough cricket, but I'm not complaining. Mentally and physically,
I'm in good nick.''

YOU want variety? These singer/guitarists rustled up more variety than
the Inversneckie Grocer, and although the expression ''jacks of all
trades'' sprang to mind, they can't be faulted for effort. A random
sample from their solo sets covers declining industries and the Highland
Clearances (Steele), with Barker, a singer who uses that combination of
confidence and vulnerability blues singers cherish to splendid effect,
juxtaposing Bessie Smith territory, with, what else?, Genesis's I Know
What I Like.
Like the Genesis song, their duo numbers, Dobie Gray's singalong
Driftaway and, ahem, Honky Tonk Woman, also had a ''things we've always
wanted to do but daren't'' feel, particularly the latter, although
Steele's bodhran solo was probably more animated than the original
drummer has been in years.

A TWO-week-old business which makes giftware from horseshoes is
undoubtedly the youngest at the Scottish Autumn Trade Fair, which has
moved this year to the Mark Phillips Equestrian Centre at Gleneagles,
writes IAN McCONNELL.
Alan Cameron and his business partner, Eddie Inglis, have been burning
the midnight oil in Dunfermline during the last fortnight, to get their
Shoe Design venture off the ground in time for the gift industry
exhibition.
The 150 companies being represented are expected to have secured about
#2m of initial orders by the time the four-day event ends today.
About 1300 buyers, ranging from small gift shops to department stores,
will have visited the trade fair.
Shoe Design was born after Helen McNeill, an Edinburgh-based agent for
companies in the gift industry and a friend of Mr Cameron, spotted a
horseshoe wine rack in his house. She believed his equestrian creations
could be big business.
Mr Cameron and Mr Inglis have since developed a range which includes
hat stands, plant holders, letter racks and telephone stands. Buyers
have been snapping up their products, which are very much in keeping
with the trade fair's new venue.
Trade Exhibitions Scotland, based in the Perthshire village of Braco,
has staged its autumn trade fair in Glasgow for more than 20 years.
Faced with falling numbers, it decided to switch the event to Gleneagles
and the number of exhibitors is the highest for a few years.
Gifts, covering everything from low-cost tartan souvenirs to expensive
cashmere garments, are a multi-million-pound business.
Corrie McGibbon, who set up Trade Exhibitions Scotland, has a database
containing more than 5500 retailers and distributors in the industry.
Commenting on the move to Gleneagles, Mr McGibbon said: ''We just felt
it was a better venue. It is a smaller event and people look for
atmosphere.''

CARMEL Howard's one-woman show actually has five characters. The
central figure around whom the others orbit is one Annie 'Urley
(presumably related to our Liz). Annie, an 84-year-old widow living in
sheltered accommodation in Liverpool, has a face like fizz and a nice
line in Hilda Ogden-type gaffes.
Howard's 'Urley is a brilliant tragi-comic composite of the mannerisms
and idiosyncracies of old people, and their pre-occupations with each
others medical histories.
The problem is with Howard's writing, which lets down her performance,
and which too often verges on bad taste.

<HEADLINE>Manweb move not a monopoly issue, regulator told. SCID supports ScottishPower bid</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRISTOPHER SIMS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976748606</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Council Development and Industry (SCDI) has thrown its
weight behind ScottishPower in its lobbying to avoid the bid for Manweb
being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Hamish Morrison, SCDI chief executive, has written to electricity
regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild to say there is no competition
or regulation issue which would merit a referral.
He argues that concerns about the collection of regulatory information
should Manweb become a subsidiary of a larger company could be met by
amendments to the operating licence and by undertakings given by
ScottishPower to the Department of Trade and Industry.
These provisions would enable the same information to be provided as
now, thus preserving Manweb as a comparator with other electricity
distributors, which is of particular concern of the regulator. Mr
Morrison said it could be argued that the aggregate performance of the
merged group would provide a new comparator for the larger English
distributors.
He also pointed out that a combined group would have less than 5% of
that part of the English and Welsh market open to competition, while
vertical integration could only occur if ScottishPower were to supply
power directly to Manweb domestic customers, which is expressly
forbidden under the operating licence.
Analysts believe a decision on a monopolies referral will come early
in September and that ScottishPower should be more worried about
Professor Littlechild's opinion than that of the Office of Fair Trading.
Professor Littlechild has to go through the OFT and he is submitting his
recommendation this week.
It is considered unlikely that a general inquiry will be launched into
the electricity distributors, rather that each bid will be considered on
its merits.
There was talk yesterday that Manweb was on the lookout for a white
knight, with a Continental suitor rumoured. There is certainly interest
in UK utilities. RWE, a German utility, has announced that it is looking
at the electricity sector, while Tractebel in Belgium already has a
stake in Northern Irish power stations, and Compagnie Lyonnaise des
Eaux's bid for Northumbrian Water is in the hands of the Monopolies
Commission.
The problem for those seeking a white knight is why would a company
become involved in a contested situation when there are so many other
power distributors available to quietly negotiate an agreed deal.
The stock market clearly sets little store by such talk as Manweb
shares languish well below the offer price at 886p, though they would
soon come to life if the monopolies reference hurdle was surmounted.
Meanwhile, ScottishPower's market purchases have given it a whisker
under 15% of Manweb and, having spent around #140m, it too may now wait
for the monopolies decision.
* THE American power company which is bidding #1000m for South Western
Electricity (Sweb) has extended its takeover offer until September 4.
Southern Co launched its hostile bid for the Bristol-based electricity
group last month and since then has been steadily buying shares in the
market.
It now speaks for 14.4% of the company, including acceptances already
pledged from shareholders.
Earlier this month, Sweb's neighbouring regional electricity company
Southern announced it was holding takeover talks with Sweb, but hours
later it withdrew because of what it said were problems with regulatory
uncertainty.

YOUR article (August 21) on less well-known memorials to Sir William
Wallace misses an important one. One the steps at the west end of St
Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster there is a small brass
plaque, lying amongst those recording who lay in state and when, which
reads: ''Near this spot, at the Kings Bench at the south end of the
Hall, took place the trial of Sir William Wallace, the Scottish Patriot,
on Monday, 23rd August, 1305''.
I pointed this out to a Scots friend, remarking with anger that no
mention was made of the legitimacy of the trial, the predetermined
verdict, or his brutal death. His ironic reply was: ''Ah, but he must
have been guilty. He was a Scottish Patriot''.
I am grateful to The Herald for bringing to our attention a more
honourable memorial in London to our national hero.
There is a very serious point here. The Palace containing the British
Parliament is filled with depictions of English history from before the
Union -- including a fascinating mural depicting Charles II disembarking
at Dover to be restored to his throne, with a Union flag conspicuously
decorating the edge of the painting.
There is, however, virtually no pre-Union Scots, Welsh, or Irish
history depicted. This is reflected in the heraldic embellishment of the
building itself, where English designs are hugely predominant in number.
While it might be argued that Westminster was the home of England's
Parliament before the Union, and that the Scots Parliament has left its
own memorials north of the Border, it is the case that that imbalance in
the statuary, art, and architecture of Westminster can be a source of a
feeling of alienation -- a sense of having been allowed to join the
English Parliament in 1707, rather than a new, British institution.
Perhaps the surge of interest in Wallace and the forthcoming 700th
anniversary of his death might be used to start putting this imbalance
to rights? Instead of the squalid, uninformative little plaque in St
Stephen's Hall, might not a statue of Wallace be erected outside the
Hall?
In support of this proposal it can be strongly argued that Wallace was
in his own way a significant parliamentarian. He was appointed Guardian
of the Realm by the Scots Parliament, and it was to the Parliament that
he gave his resignation after Falkirk. All of his acts were carried out
in the name of the ''Community of the Realm''.
The same cannot be said of Richard Coeur de Lion, who mercilessly
squeezed the English Parliament for all it was worth in support of his
crusade, his ransom, and his French wars, and yet is commemorated in
heroic style near the Chancellor's Gate entrance to the Palace.
Symbolism and the manipulation of myth are powerful elements in the
make-up of every polity. A prominent statue of William Wallace, standing
outside the hall where he was condemned to be the victim of one of the
more horrendous judicial murders in the history of these islands, might
serve as a powerful educational weapon in spreading the importance of an
understanding that Westminster was not supposed to be just the
continuation of the English Parliament by another name.
It might also do honour to a man fast becoming an international hero
in the wake of the film Braveheart.

JINGS, crivvens, and help ma Boab. It cannae be true. A Scottish
newspaper actually printed a full-page article with a positive slant on
a Scottish historical subject without the Scottish cringe or angling for
brownie points with the obligatory cliques on the terrors of shortbread
tins, 'eather, 'aggis, tartans and kilts (Braveheart's London beat, by
James McKillop and Keith Sinclair, August 21).
Michty me, is someone getting their books? Or wis the editor aff that
day? Or will Michael Fry and Brian Wilson be given more of the Lord
Harley Defoe gold equivalent? (Lord Harley, whose private-sector doctors
have a London street in his name, was the Union paymaster for English
spies such as Defoe who paid out the Scots pro-Unionists of his day.)
Will the resident letter-writers from Ardfern and Giffnock be given
more imperial space to re-hoist the ''Union'' Jacks by proving William
Wallace was a Unionist, or Tartan Terrorist, and King Edward of England,
sorry Great Britain, a charitable organisation for Celts and a tourist
attraction for the benefit of Scotland?
It says something for the common people of Scotland that their
national heroes are a warrior and poet, both reviled, ridiculed and
betrayed and pushed to an early grave by the pro-Anglo Establishment for
their own selfish ends.
None of their ''superiors'', both past and present, can hold a candle
to the hearts of the common people who never betrayed the love of
liberty or national identity and icons.

I AM afraid your article ''Row grows over single mothers'' (August 18)
grossly oversimplifies the issue and misrepresents what Peter Lilley and
John Redwood are actually saying. The debate should not be about single
mothers -- nor indeed single parents -- many of whom do a very good job
of bringing up their children, and never ask the state for any help in
the process.
Instead, the debate should be about the growing number of
14-16-year-olds who, through their own fecklessness, become pregnant.
Consequently, because of their circumstances, they are dependent
entirely upon the taxpayer for support.
The worrying problem for any Government is how to slow down -- and
halt -- this moral decline. One way to do so is to promote family values
which seem to have been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness
over the past few years.
People should be encouraged, through the tax system for a start, to
marry. The married person's tax allowance should be increased
substantially. Married couples should then be encouraged to wait until
they can afford children before having them -- as many couples already
do.
Therefore I believe Peter Lilley is right to look again at the
benefits to single parents who depend entirely upon the state, and who
have no prospect of employment. Some of these benefits should be phased
out and the money used to promote the family.
This is a very serious issue which should be dealt with now before the
problems get worse. It is just a pity that politicians like Donald Dewar
cannot take the debate a bit more seriously instead of resorting to
silly political rhetoric.

The Bank of Scotland has recently announced a freeze on account
transaction charges for business and personal customers for the second
consecutive year. This means that once again charges will be maintained
at 1993 levels.
This decision, which will remain in force until at least July 1996,
endorses the Bank of Scotland's commitment to providing customers with
excellent service coupled with competitively priced charges.
Clearly, there are instances where particular customers have
requirements for non-standard services which are not covered by the
bank's normal scale of charges. Charges for such services are determined
on an individual basis, reflecting the nature and amount of work
involved and are subject to periodic review.

SO MUCH for expectations. This review, I should say at the start, is
written in the face of a capacity Usher Hall crowd who quite evidently
loved everything that went on last night, howled for more, and got it.
Let's not be small in our assessment of conductor Yuri Temirkanov. He
has been artistic boss of the Kirov Opera, who themselves are in
Edinburgh this week. For the past eight years he has been music director
of the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, one of the plum jobs in the
music world, West or East. Temirkanov, in other words, is no small
potatoes; wee Yuri is up there among the big boys. And on his night, he
is among the best.
Last night, in the St Petersburg Phil's second concert of the
festival, he was pure mince. Whatever else anyone might think of last
night, it seemed clear that Temirkanov was on the wrong turf. Give him
Russian music and he'll dazzle your socks off. Last night he was in the
company of Dvorak and Elgar; precisely, he was at sea with them.
Whether or not he was temperamentally unsuitable to Dvorak's Seventh
Symphony, we can argue about. Whatever, it came over like no symphony at
all. Unlike the Eighth, which Temirkanov's colleague Mariss Jansons took
the other night, the Seventh is more of a pure, abstract symphony. The
Eighth has big, rosy melodies, blossoming harmonies, and soaring
climaxes.
The Seventh is more intellectual, which Temirkanov completely failed
to grasp. The fingerprints were all over it from the start: a shudder of
dark strings, and swirling, tempestuous music that was -- of course --
fascinating to listen to from the St Petersburg Phil, but had nothing to
do with symphonic logic. Continuously Temirkanov seemed to be trying to
make a colouristic piece out of the symphony, which plainly didn't work.
There was no logic, no drama, and it lumbered along from one movement to
another.
If it lumbered, Elgar's Enigma Variations, in the most bizarre account
I have ever heard, shuddered and stopped. Repeatedly. Temirkanov made no
attempt to introduce any continuity. Literally, following Nimrod, he
stopped as though after a slow movement. There was no ebb and flow, and
multiple attempts to Russify the music -- fast stuff like Tchaikovsky,
slow music as rich as Rachmaninov. And some of the oddest internal
orchestral balancing beyond Elgar's wildest imaginings.
Much of the playing, of course, was sumptuous. But if, earlier, the St
Petersburg's Dvorak had been all at sea, then their Elgar was becalmed
somewhere between the Malvern Hills and the Volga.

THE better-than-expected German money supply figures, with M3 falling
back 0.4% in July rather than the rise of up to 0.7% forecast by some
analysts, fuelled the dollar upwards against the mark. There were
increasing hopes of a fall in German interest rates.
The US unit rose by more than a pfennig to DM1.4880 before easing off
on rumours of central bank selling.
In contrast, the pound was again largely sidelined. It closed more
than half-a-cent weaker against the dollar at $1.5353, while against the
mark it firmed by over a pfennig to DM2.2799 by the close.
The trade-weighted index rose 0.3 to 84.4.
However, trading on all the exchanges tapered off ahead of the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Commitee meeting.

THE notion that the forces of law and order, the police, the courts,
and the prisons, could drive the misuse of banned drugs out of Western
societies had faltered badly by the end of the past decade.
America's failure was there for all to see. Having spent literally
billions on interdiction they had ended up with more crack in the black
ghettoes, more pot everywhere, more cocaine-snorting middle classes than
ever before -- and more and more violent crime, including violence
directed against the police. Drug wars were discredited.
It has, however, become increasingly unfashionable to say that. The
pendulum appears to have swung back and politicians (the interest group
which experience tells us we should least trust) immediately condemn
anyone who questions the rhetoric as irresponsible, or a loony radical,
or both. And the police, under pressure from all sides in the past three
years, have no real option but to respond.
That scenario is one reading of why we are in the midst of Operation
Eagle, the two-phase attack on Strathclyde's drugs sub-culture which is
rapidly approaching the end of its first stage involving the raising of
awareness of drugs misuse throughout the region.
Although it is too early to judge positive results, any straw poll
would be odds-on to show that the message has got through on a wide
scale because the efforts of Strathclyde Police and their allied
agencies have been unflagging. Chief Constable Leslie Sharp has turned
in his now-customary brilliant job in harnessing the Scottish media to
his cause and no-one will ever find fault with him for doing that.
The next stage, now only one week away, is likely to prove the more
controversial part of the operation. A decade ago, again in a response
to public (media?) pressure, Glasgow experienced a period of intensive
and tough policing aimed at the comparatively small heroin-using group
and their suppliers. Heroin was driven off the streets of the city; at
some points it was merely scarce, at others it was simply unobtainable,
and there were a number of results.
The most visible and traumatic was the destabilising of the Scottish
prison system, but there were others in the long term. The drugs trade
became even more lucrative for the unscrupulous men with the ability to
bankroll deals and, at the same time, thousands of strung-out heroin
users turned to their GPs for help. Lo and behold, what were they
prescribed? The tranquilliser Temazepam -- and that started a whole new
ball game the results of which we are now seeing in record death levels
of drug misusers who either resort to lethal drug cocktails or misjudge
the strength of street drugs, having become used to the stable qualities
of pharmaceutical drugs.
The fall-out from that drug is one of the major problems that
Operation Eagle now has to tackle. There has been every indication so
far that the senior officers at Strathclyde Police are aware of the
historical risks of failure associated with all-out drugs wars, hence
the two-pronged attack, and no-one aware of the enormous concentration
of efforts and resources which are poised awaiting the enforcement phase
will harbour any doubts but that it will be attended with success.
David Bryce, founder of the successful rehabilitation scheme in the
East End, Calton Athletic, through which he is in daily touch with
grassroots drugs culture, is convinced that the first phase of Eagle has
worked both in raising awareness and in creating an vast new store of
intelligence on the street dealers and some of the bigger fish.
''I have no doubts that there will be many arrests. Most of the
dealers are also using because it is an easy way to make money. They do
not see the day approaching because they are also users. But there are
only two kinds of drug dealer as far as I am concerned -- those in the
jail and those waiting to go into jail,'' he grimly observes.
It is this aspect, the arrest and criminalisation of many low-level
user-dealers, that bothers David Liddell, director of the Scottish Drugs
Forum. Drugs wars, he believes, cannot be won and the fall-out is
invariably more damaging in the long run.
He says: ''The police have to be seen to be flexing their muscles when
what is needed is a more flexible and thoughtful approach with a much
lower profile.
''The serious concern must be that post-Operation Eagle drug taking in
Strathclyde simply takes more problematic forms. It could be driven
further underground with fewer people with serious problems coming into
contact with the agencies. In places such as Possil at the moment there
is a high level of fear at what is coming.''
The dichotomy in Glasgow's policies -- promised severe interdiction on
the one hand, the health-based initiatives of Greater Glasgow Health
Board with successful needle exchanges and a methadone substitution
programme (of which the chief constable is) paradoxically, a very strong
supporter on the other -- is now glaringly obvious. Professor John
Davies of Strathclyde University's psychology department, believes that
the two policies make strange bedfellows.
''Drug prevention and interdiction of supply is based on the myth that
normal people lead drug-free lives and that if you do not comply there
is something wrong with you. That, of course, ignores the whole swathe
of alcohol use and its problems.
''The two strands do not form what I would call a coherent policy. One
or the other would be better. There is now a danger that you get the
worst of both worlds,'' he says.
The picture that emerges is that Operation Eagle's enforcement phase
is not being universally welcomed. On the other hand the Government will
be pleased. It is far cheaper to tackle the symptoms of drug misuse than
to create the jobs which give lives a meaning, removing what the
Scottish Office's own Drugs Task Force called the ''deprivation,
alienation, and poverty of aspiration'' which is the root cause.

A PIECE of self-indulgence about, er, self-indulgence. And the fact
that this two-man American play by In Your Face Productions draws
repeated attention to its self-indulgence -- it's about two actors
playing themselves and getting hung up on the nature of performance
while they perform -- does not redeem it any.
What does redeem it (and I'm certain they know they would get away
with it nowhere but Edinburgh) is the strength of the performances by
Benjamin Lloyd, also the writer, and Pearce Bunting. That, plus a
smattering of comedy and several bursts of lucidity in-between the
auto-referentiality, make it intermittently enjoyable despite itself.
Oh, and further to Lloyd's amusing tirade about critics: yes, I accept
your apology.

YET more gloom from the housing sector came yesterday from three
participants, with a survey by Britannia Building Society finding
homeowners the most pessimistic for three years, the closure of estate
agent branches by Bristol &amp; West Building Society and higher losses
reported by Hambro Countrywide estate agents.
Britannia's quarterly survey found that 51% of homeowners were ''not
confident at all'' about a revival in the market in the next year,
against 46% in February. This is the highest proportion since 1992.
Though 78% considered now was the right time to buy, the proportion
actually contemplating a move shrunk from 7% to 5%.
Bristol &amp; West said it would close 25 out of the 71 branches of its
subsidiary, Hamptons, with the loss of 100 jobs. The decision reflects
the decline in the number of housing transactions.
The society still managed to stay on an even keel in the first half of
the year, making profits of #34.3m before exceptionals against #33m.
Hambro Countrywide's first-half losses widened sharply from #707,000
to #5.82m. Transactions handled fell 6% to 31,000 and the average house
price was down 4.6% on a year earlier. But the group said the
newly-acquired branches from Nationwide Building Society increased their
business by 109% and the trend is expected to continue.
Hambro is now buying Premium Life Assurance for #2.4m.

IT was a triumph of theatrical soothsaying. No, no, it was trash: it
was Fringe legend Arthur Smith Sid James'ing about again in an in-jokey
and indulgent fashion . . . one year singing Dean Martin songs, this
year murdering Shakespeare.
But you must admit Sally Phillips' foul-mouthed, flute-playing Ophelia
was transcendent, and Arthur did succeed in convincing us of the
profundity which can reside in a drunkard's banal song.
And he read us a moving poem about optimism in the face of hope
lessness. And then a bloke bounced on in a bear suit. Triumphant
soothsaying? I should coco.
So OK, it was trash, but it was theatrical, and it was a small
triumph.
Above all it was Arthur Smith.

THERE has been a change in Bosnian metaphors. Two weeks ago, after the
Croats' victory in the Krajina, President Clinton told of ''a window of
opportunity'' to bring peace to the former Yugoslavia.
Now that the American peace plan is in trouble, officials here refer
to their task as a labour of Sisyphus. There was a personal disaster for
the A team on Saturday, when three of its most senior members were
killed in a car crash on the road over Mt Igman into Sarajevo. Now the
President must find other people to heave that stone.
Before their defeat in the Krajina, the Serbs had believed victory was
inevitable.
Now they fear that they may lose all Bosnia. Perhaps, Mr Clinton and
his advisers thought, they might settle for the American proposal.
But the victors saw things differently. The Croats and Muslims
suddenly hope for a complete victory over their enemies. So why should
they accept the American plan, which would involve allowing most of the
Serbian gains in Bosnia, and even giving them the last Moslem enclave in
the east, Goradze?
There was another unforeseen consequence of the Croat victory.
Slobodan Milosevic's own position has been severely weakened. There are
now at least 100,000 refugees from the Krajina in Serbia, with more to
follow. Great numbers of Serbs blame Milosevic for the defeat, so he is
reluctant to accept the American plan, which would meaning abandoning
''Greater Serbia''.
Furthermore, the Serbs' defeat has split the Bosnian Serb regime.
Those two war criminals, Radovan Karadzik and Gen Ratko Mladic, are now
at each other's throats and neither is in any mood to concede any ground
to his enemies.
So when the American team set out, with high hopes and the support of
their European allies for once, they believed they might actually pull
it off. Now the stone is rolling back down the hill, with both sides
preparing the next round of fighting.
It is most dangerous to predict what may happen. A month ago, after
the Serbs occupied Srebrenica and Zepa and drove women and children into
exile and took all the men into a field and shot them, it seemed quite
probable that they would then take Goradze and, perhaps, Bihac.
There appeared to be no hope at all that Nato would do anything to
stop them. We have yet to see whether Nato's latest bluster means
anything (it has promised to defend Goradze, Sarajevo, and Tuzla from
the air) but the other neglected factor in the equation has now pushed
to the fore.
No-one really took Croatia seriously. In June the Bosnian army tried
an offensive out of Sarajevo, helped by the Croatian army. It failed
miserably. Indeed, ever since the 1991 ceasefire in the Serb-Croatian
war, the Croatian army had failed ignominiously every time it tried to
recover territory in Krajina.
Then, suddenly, Croatia recovered a small province called Western
Slavonia and expelled 15,000 Serbs. There was talk of a deal between
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Milosevic, that Croatia would be
allowed to recover the Krajina and Serbia would keep eastern Slavonia,
the border region around Vukovar captured in 1991. Under that alleged
proposal, the Serbs would keep all their conquests in Bosnia.
Still no-one took the Croatians seriously -- until they conquered
Krajina in 48 hours. That was no deal, that was an outright military
victory.
Suddenly, all western Bosnia looked vulnerable. If the Croats help the
Bosnians, they might capture Banja Luka and drive half a million more
Serbs back into Serbia, and they are clearly intent on pushing the Serbs
back from Dubrovnik.
So where does the American peace plan stand today? The short answer
is: dead; the long answer: on life support.
The chief official dealing with the question, Richard Holbrooke, who
was in another car in the same convoy on Mt Igman when his colleagues
were killed, brought the bodies back on Monday. He will return to the
Balkans at the end of the week in a last effort to roll that stone up
the hill again.
If he fails, the war will resume, and the Congress here will probably
override President Clinton's veto and lift the arms embargo on Bosnia.
The Republicans have all the votes they need in the House. There is some
doubt that Senator Bob Dole can muster the two-thirds majority he needs
in the Senate, but a conspicuous failure of the American plan, which was
touted as the one most likely to succeed just a fortnight ago, might
very well persuade the waverers to desert the President, who will have
another foreign policy disaster on his hands. He has promised to send
American troops into Bosnia to help the UN withdrawal and, while that
will be easier now that Srebrenica and Zepa have been obliterated and
Bihac relieved, it will still be a messy business.
The President will bear all the blame, especially if a number of
Americans are killed.

<HEADLINE>Keltek aims for global market with #4.5m deal</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S electronics industry received a significant boost yesterday
with the announcement of a #4.5m takeover of a major Essex contract
electronics manufacturer by the Borders-based company Keltek.
Keltek are hailing the buy-up and expansion deal as a key step towards
creating extra jobs and a global #100m business. The firm is pledging
that its operation will remain firmly Scottish run.
Keltek has bought EDMS of Maldon -- which has a turnover of #20m a
year -- after three months of negotiations. The firm will now be known
as Keltek EDMS.
Keltek currently employ just under 300 workers in Kelso, making
equipment for telecommunications, computing, medical, multimedia and
instrumentation customers. They even build electronic lottery equipment
for a US firm.
Business development director Andrew Allen said yesterday: ''We expect
continued growth in job numbers in the Borders over the next two years.
There has been a trend for some companies to rebase to the South but
that trend will be reversed as far as Keltek is concerned.
''All our planning has centred on basing the headquarters of the
business in Kelso. All the main shareholding directors and partners live
here and intend to stay living here.
''The whole of the financial support package has been put together
from Scotland and one of our main supporters is the Bank of Scotland. We
see ourselves very much as a Scottish-based business and are 100%
committed to Scotland and the Borders.''
Keltek Electronics was set up in 1993 following a management buy-out
from the parent company Graseby plc. Turnover has grown from #14m to
#28m projected for the end of this year.
EDMS clients include Acorn Computers, Reuters and Pitney Bowes.
The new Keltek EDMS group chief executive Mike Jarman says: ''We are
delighted at this acquisition. We are now a major force in the middle
ground and are planning a substantial investment programme benefiting
both plants over the next 18 months.
''Forecasts for our sector indicate growth from #1300m in 1994 to
#3000m in 1999 and we intend to take advantage of the immense
opportunities.''

* LIFE as a cultural commentator isn't the doddle it sounds, you know.
All the clues are laid out in front of you, it is true, but what are you
to make of them? A week before the Festival began, for example, the
local chip shop handed me a mushroom supper wrapped in the programme for
the Pleasantly Assembled Gilded Rooms. That's this year's programme, not
last year's. Imminent disaster brought about by total public
indifference, I speculated, or could it be that the Big Three's
marketing strategy had gone irretrievably down-market?
I assumed the latter until reports of a sighting of Assembly supremo
Bill Burdett-Coutts drifted my way. Could that really have been the same
man-of-many-jobs spotted getting out of a taxi outside hip venue of the
moment, the Palladium, only to turn on his heels seemingly at the rough
and ready look of the place, and jump straight back into the cab?
Is Burdett-Coutts not man enough to watch the Tap Dogs in such an
unsavoury venue without an accompanying grown-up? And if he ever does
get to see those testosterone hounds from Oz, hard-tapping,
muscle-flexing, sweat-dripping hunks who are to the New Man what
Samantha Fox was to feminism, would he invest in the mooted T-shirt
reading: ''Tap Dogs -- I want to have your puppies''?
Meanwhile the mean and moody underground types at Damage just can't
get low-life enough. When they first programmed their naughty-but-nice
line-up of theatre for the rave generation plus talks by ex-gangsters
(not to mention an associated publication as high on copyright
infringements as their celebrity authors are on drugs), their venue was
known as the M8 Club.
Perhaps not the most controversial of names, but it did at least have
a bit of, er, drive. Only thing is, since the Fringe began, the owners
have decided to rechristen the West End club as The Palais, suggesting
more the handbag-and-cocktail set than the anguished rebel yell of
dissolute youth. Director John-Paul McGroarty is 27. Actor Tam Dean Burn
is old enough to know better.
* BACK at the sedate and unraunchy Assembly Rooms, where people prefer
to faint than to break sweat (Trainspotting casualties: three on the
first night), the ever-loyal press office has been inspired by our
Herald Angel awards to make its own weekly nominations for the good, the
bad, and the ugly.
The first Assembly Angel went to middle-American stand-up Diane Ford
(39 going on quite a lot older). Hooray! And an emergency extra category
of God of the Week had to be introduced to acknowledge the omnipotent
beneficence of pop prince Ray 'ell-o-ell-ay'' Davies.
But a ripple of paranoia is lapping over George Street as the
nomination for Assembly Devil has been left ominously blank. I'm sure
you know who you are.
* LAST week, clean-living Michael Dobbs, the sometime deputy Tory
Party chairman, made the front page after complaining that the BBC had
stuck in a new scene depicting the state funeral of Baroness Thatcher in
his forthcoming political thriller, The Final Cut. If he thinks this is
''appalling bad taste'', perhaps he should head down to the Gilded
Balloon where Richard Hallam has been merrily dancing on the former
leader's coffin every afternoon for some days now.
As a card-carrying member of the Tory Party, Dobbs will even be able
to take up Hallam, who stars in The Prime Minister's Son, on his
two-for-the-price-of-one offer. And if Dobbs defects to the Labour Party
in disgust, he'll get a three-for-one deal. So far one Labour supporter
and no Tories have taken Hallam up.
* I KNOW cash-flow is a problem at this time of year, but it was sad
to see an eight-strong company of Poles trying to work out how to
survive on their #32 per diems allocated by the Demarco Foundation
(increased from #30 when they complained it wouldn't divide by eight).
And how close were we to an international incident when ex-President
Lansbergis of Lithuania was forced to cadge the price of a bag of crisps
off Richard Demarco in Dundee?

THE French securities commission COB yesterday opened an investigation
into the roller-coaster ride in Eurotunnel shares since the beginning of
the week.
''Given the rumours and movements that have affected the price of
Eurotunnel shares on August 21 and on the morning of August 22, the COB
has decided to open an inquiry,'' the commission said in a statement.
Shares in Eurotunnel slid 17% on the Paris bourse on Monday on
speculation that a cash squeeze might require a debt restructuring which
in turn might dilute the value of the shares.
Although the company said on Monday that it was not in talks with the
banks, a rogue story appeared in France reporting that Eurotunnel had
signed a debt-restructuring agreement.
The company issued a quick denial.
Eurotunnel co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said: ''I formally refute the
information published indicated that an agreement with the banks has
been signed.
''I consider the distribution of such news, not verified by a company
representative, intolerable.''
Investors, however, sold shares on fears that any restructuring deal
might include a debt-for-equity arrangement that would dilute the value
of their shares, which have already lost more than 50% since the
beginning of the year.
The stock hit a new year low of Ffr10.6 before rebounding to close at
Ffr11.80, up 7% on the day. In London the shares closed 9p higher at
147p
Eurotunnel requested that the COB probe the trading activity ''to
protect the interests of shareholders who cannot be victims of such
malevolent acts''.
A spokeswoman yesterday said the company was set to begin meeting with
its banks in September.
The debt-laden group recently said it was issue a revised 1995
forecast alongside its first-half results at the beginning of October.

WHEN Eamonn de Valera wrote appealing to James Joyce to return from
European exile and enrich the culture of an Ireland newly liberated from
the British yoke, he got a very dusty reply. The greatest wordsmith of
the twentieth century noted that, so far from being liberated, six of
the 32 counties actually seemed to prefer the yoke, and implied that
they had good reason for their choice. Once the Taoiseach actually
created a culture congenial to them, then he, Joyce, might reconsider.
In the event, he never had occasion to.
The connection between politics and culture formed the subject of a
discussion yesterday at the Edinburgh Book Festival. It went to show
that, whatever the connection may be, we in Scotland, or at least the
gurus invited to pontificate on the subject, have not grasped it.
There was a good deal of fashionable blether about the superior virtue
of small countries over big countries as matrices of culture. This flies
in the face of observable historical fact. If you love poetry, novels,
drama, music, painting, you will find for each almost equally rich
cultural grazing in England, France, Germany, Russia. But who cares abut
Dutch poetry, Portuguese novels, Belgian drama, Danish music, Finnish
painting?
The fact is that small countries, by their nature, cannot be good at
everything. Limited in their resources, they are incapable of continuous
cultural achievement. They have instead to rely on sporadic cultural
revivals. Individuals of genius who happen meanwhile to find themselves
in cultural dead-water are best advised to go elsewhere, as those from
Scotland often have.
Another problem is that small countries have to spend too much time
and energy asserting themselves, an effort necessary if they are to
survive, but unfortunate because it is culturally narrowing. Small
countries are almost forced to be chauvinist. They have to cry down the
big countries round them and proclaim that, contrary to the evidence,
they are just as good.
In no case is this more obvious than in that of Paul Scott, cultural
spokesman of the Scottish National Party and one of the gurus in
yesterday's debate. He is unflagging in the cause of Scottish culture,
and his sincere devotion to it can only be admired. But his vision of it
gives me the creeps.
After a perfunctory and unconvincing attempt to link political with
cultural revivals in Scotland, he settled into a familiar diatribe which
reduced every Scottish problem to a single reason: the lack of
independence. But Scotland is, if nothing else, a complex country,
remarkably complex for its size, which is what makes it interesting to
live in.
And, whether or not we wish things otherwise, there is a part of
Scotland that is and will forever be British, by the inescapable fact of
300 years of Union. The British legacy goes along with the Celtic
legacy, the Protestant legacy, the enlightened legacy, the imperial
legacy, the European legacy, to form the Scotland that we know and love.
To single out one of those legacies, to say that this (and this alone)
is the source of all our woes, to call for it to be rooted out -- well,
that is what I mean by cultural narrowing. It would make Scotland a less
generous and receptive, an altogether poorer, country.
At least, however, a misdirected passion underlay this chauvinism,
something entirely lacking in a second of yesterday's gurus, Charles
Kennedy. Liberal Democratic friends tell me there is a good chance of
his heading their happy band sometime soon, which I should welcome: he
would be the roundest leader of any party since, ooh, Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman, and a pleasing contrast to the lean and hungry men
whose naked ambition renders modern British politics so disagreeable.
But roundness generally indicates contentment, and contentment is not
conducive to culture. Nor indeed is naked ambition, which leads straight
to deadening conformity. Culture arises rather from divine discontent, a
vision of the world out of joint and an urge to make it in some ultimate
sense whole. These are deep matters, however. I shall simply observe
that Charles Kennedy touched on none of them.
So there was a clear run at politics and culture for the third guru,
Neal Ascherson. He has spent much of his life looking at small but
heroic nations, the ranks of which he has always wanted Scots to join --
so far, it must be said, without arousing much of a response.
This time he set before us the example of Abkhazia, a country on the
shores of the Black Sea which appears to have successfully vindicated
its independence. What is more, it is undergoing a cultural revival, or
at least has found its national bard, in one Fazil Iskander. The only
trouble is that he resolutely refuses to go near the place, but lives in
Moscow and writes in Russian.
Did I detect here a none too distant analogy with Neal Ascherson
himself, a son of Leith still passionately concerned with his native
land who nevertheless contemplates whatever its future may hold from the
heights of Islington?
Perhaps there is indeed here a lesson for us all, that the wells of
individual and national being are in the end unfathomable, that we are
best just to let them flow, not to wrench them out of one course into
another, at any rate not through the delusions of political action.
In fact Neil Ascherson said as much. Here a man so often wrong -- if,
like his friend Tom Nairn, never less than magnificently so -- may, just
for once, have been right.

EUROPE'S biggest oil and gas export terminal at Sullom Voe in Shetland
has handled 5.5 billion tonnes of oil since 1978. Long after its peak in
the late 1980s, it still ships out 104,000 tonnes a day, 40% of UK North
Sea crude. It is worth many millions to the Exchequer, not least because
of export earnings in the United States. Now its future is on the line.
Four months ago, Shell UK alarmed many people in Shetland by
commissioning a #500,000 study of whether it would be cheaper to load
tankers offshore at the Brent field than at Sullom Voe, 100 miles down
the Brent pipeline.
For the first time, it became clear that Shell's threat to pull out of
Sullom Voe after the year 2000 was not just another negotiating ploy to
put the financial screws on Shetland Islands Council. Shell had never
liked paying all that money to Shetland and now it seriously intended to
do something about it.
Most of the Shell study has been completed, but the company's
economists are still doing their sums. A decision is expected before the
end of the year. The council says it has been told by the industry that
offshore loading looks cheaper, by #16m a year, than continuing to use
Sullom Voe. Shell says it does not know where that figure came from, but
the council's public position is that the cost differential could be as
low as #500,000 a year.
BP, as operators of the Sullom Voe plant, is arguing that the council
must give up its income from the special deals negotiated from 1972
onwards if it wishes to keep the terminal in business. There can be no
more free lunches for the 22,500 Shetlanders.
Councillors accept the inescapable logic of this and appear willing to
reduce their take from the terminal. But they say the lunches were never
as free, as big, or as frequent as the oilmen say. They are demanding to
see BP and Shell's sums before they will relinquish their local
royalties, land rents, and other payments.
For many months, council negotiators have been shuttling between
Sumburgh and oil company offices in Aberdeen, trying to put accurate
numbers in the blanks on the council's checklist. Council sources
suggested yesterday that they would be good customers of British Airways
for a while yet.
The argument over the figures is critical because the Brent rethink is
a key part of an industry-wide campaign called Cost Reduction In The New
Era (Crine).
A major Crine project is going on north-east of Shetland. Shell plans
to reduce offshore staff by half, increase efficiency, extract more oil
and gas, and prolong the life of Brent when its five-year refurbishment
of the ageing oilfield is completed in 1998.
By 2005, Brent will be converted to a gas field as its recoverable oil
reservoirs are exhausted. The gas will go down the Flags pipeline system
to St Fergus. The question agitating Shetland councillors is what will
happen to the smaller oilfields around Brent which currently pump their
oil through the system to Sullom Voe and will still be producing long
after Brent is dry.
Nothing is going to happen very quickly. Shell, BP, and the other 30
or so participants in Sullom Voe are locked into signed contracts with
Shetland Islands Council until August 31, 2000. The agreements, signed
back in the mid-1970s, guarantee the council an income until the last
tanker sails.
Shell insisted yesterday that it was committed to using Sullom Voe for
the next five years. However, if Brent does bypass Sullom Voe after
that, a chain reaction of job losses and plant closures must follow, and
not only in Shetland.
The Ninian pipeline, in which BP and Chevron have major interests,
could still pump oil to Sullom Voe but the signs are that a single
pipeline would not be enough to sustain the Shetland terminal. Handling
costs per barrel of oil would soar and industry sources believe it would
soon become uneconomic, forcing the Ninian system fields to switch to
offshore loading and triggering the closure of the terminal, its
gas-fired power station, and the huge tanker harbour.
The BP terminal currently employs only 504 people but hundreds more
work in the tanker port and related industries. A recent council
estimate was that local unemployment figures could rise to 11.5% after
2000, from the steady 3% or 4% of the past six years. It is not exactly
catastrophic compared with what the rest of the nation has been through,
but it would be a huge blow to business confidence in a fragile economy
where people remember the Shetland dole queues of the 1950s.
Depending on what other uses could be found for the Sullom Voe
terminal and harbour -- a tank farm, a decommissioning yard for offshore
structures, a fish farm, and even a superquarry are among the
possibilities -- at least 1000 jobs would be on the line in Shetland as
the side effects of closure trickled through the islands' economy.
The Shetland council's chief executive, Mr Malcolm Green, believes the
net result could be 1500 people, mainly young married couples and single
persons, leaving the islands by the turn of the century.
Shetland has seen this all coming. Since the terminal opened in
October 1978, the islands council has been planning for the day when oil
is no more. The millions of pounds in revenues have been carefully
husbanded -- too carefully, according to some local critics who want the
#165m council charitable trust used to cushion the impact of recent
council budget cuts on the less well-off.
Shetland's accumulated oil capital is untouched after 21 years. Only
the interest and dividends from the oil funds have been used. Much of it
goes to various local charitable purposes. But a great deal has been
invested in the Shetland economy in the form of grants, loans, and
interest-relief grants. There is hardly a business in the islands which
has not benefited directly or indirectly from the Sullom Voe revenues.
As a result, Shetland has a much more diverse and healthy economy than
the Western Isles and many parts of the Scottish mainland. The seafood
industry is still a bigger employer than oil. Agriculture, knitwear,
tourism, and, increasingly, computer-based employment are all major
players in the economy.
Shetland would certainly survive the closure of Sullom Voe, if only
because there is a lot of other oil-related work in helicopters and
supply ships. However, it would be a poorer place and concern is growing
whether the remaining islanders could generate enough prosperity to
sustain the expensive network of social welfare, leisure centres, and
community halls.
The value of the islanders' charitable trust looks impressive per head
but it may not be a large enough umbrella for the rainy day that is
coming soon. Councillor trustees are resisting calls to increase trust
spending. With income likely to fall even before the ''Year 2000'' deals
run out, they are uncomfortably aware that the trust may very soon need
every penny in its piggy bank.
Optimistic cynics, meanwhile, look to Alaska where BP and its partners
recently announced there was a lot more oil than they had thought. Could
the North Sea and the Atlantic hold similar surprises?
They also point to the history of offshore tanker loading, which is
slower than pumping through Sullom Voe and, because it uses smaller
ships, adds to environmental risks by creating more tanker movements per
tonne of oil moved.
Would a Labour govern ment be as keen as the Tories to allow more
offshore loading at new-generation Brent Spars, particularly when it
worked out that its tax take was lower than from Sullom Voe?
Interestingly, the former Labour Oil Minister Dr Gavin Strang spent his
summer holiday in Shetland this year. He was a central figure in
securing Shetland's special powers over oil in 1974 and will be
reporting to his Shadow Cabinet colleagues on what he saw and heard.
There are plenty of cynics in Shetland these days, as ever, but not
many of them are optimistic.

WHAT Strathclyde region does with its water is no concern of ours, and
if Spain wants to splash out on a few million gallons of Adam's ale from
Loch Katrine, good luck to her.
We do hear, however, that summer over there has been far worse than
anything Britain has yet to endure, whatever hysterical headline writers
like to pretend. In the main the rain has given Spain, plain and all, a
miss -- and upset postmen no end.
In Barcelona, for example, sorting staff have been working naked on
the pavement after a demand for improved air-conditioning was blown out.
Naturally this gives a whole new meaning to the term ''buff
envelope''.
Delivery workers, meanwhile, are said to be wearing nothing but
G-strings, a move guaranteed to get even the sleepiest householder out
of bed of a morning. The Diary has no certain information, but we
conclude from this that the stalwart posties of Spain are probably male.
This has been a full and franked expose.
Jack be quick
A SURE sign the weather is about to break: the Eden Court Theatre in
Inverness, leaving nothing to chance, has already started to advertise
its Christmas panto, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Those of you rushing to secure tickets probably want to know that the
cast is led by someone from Home and Away. What we want to know is how
Jack will get his beanstalk to any decent height at all if those
hosepipe bans come into force.
Outbreak of
double talk
WE ARE grateful to Grampian Healthcare, a National Health Service
trust, for new insights into the wonders of the English language,
''trust'' and 'healthcare'' not least among them.
''Redevelopment of facilities and provision of healthcare (sic)
services in Stonehaven and the surrounding area,'' states the ad.
Translation: An offer you can't refuse.
''A competitive tendering process is about to be conducted . . .''
Translation: Feeding frenzy.
''. . . to ascertain how community hospital and related services could
best be provided for the population of the Kincardine area . . .
including the redevelopment of one of the existing hospital sites.''
Translation: What am I bid?
''The Trust envisages (a) bid comprising an appropriate package of
proposals for the design, construction, financing and operation of the
redeveloped facilities which would be innovative and would comply with
the principles and guidelines of the government's Private Finance
Initiative.''
Translation: Everything Must Go.
In plain blethers, what all this really means, of course, is that the
right to build, own, and run an entire NHS hospital -- not a bad little
monopoly -- is about to be sold off for the first time. Why couldn't
they just say so?
Sneak preview
IT IS, of course, a heinous offence to fail to purchase a TV licence.
Anyone who hasn't paid up front for the right to watch Pets Win Prizes
(Verbatim quote: ''And your horse has just won a video cassette
recorder!'') deserves all they get.
Nevertheless, tracking down evaders is a tricky business for which the
element of surprise is essential, which may or may not explain a recent
item in the Shetland Times: ''You have been warned. The TV detector van
-- or, rather, car this time -- is back. It arrived on Tuesday and was
due for a stay of about 10 days.''
Given that Shetland isn't the biggest place in the world, this leak of
crucial information ought to mean slim pickings for snoops denied a
sneak attack. Given the nature of Shetlanders, we can only report that
they caught 94 people during their last visit.
Secret boomerangs
ROLF. As entomologists among you will know, the verb to rolf has
obscure origins lost in the mists of BBC light entertainment.
Distinguished by its onomatopoeic elegance, the word can best be
understood by imagining the sounds your lunch might make as it struggles
to escape during the first bars of Two Little Boys.
That said, we are still at a loss to understand why an Australian
should have been selected to lead 3500 puffers, blawers, skin-bashers,
and pointy-stick chuckers along Princes Street the other day.
By his own confession, part of his contribution was mimed -- though
who'd have noticed or cared? -- but was this really the most stellar
celebrity the organisers could find? Tie me gullibility down, sport.
What fascinated the Diary was the subsequent appearance of Michael
Aspel, big red book in hand, in the capital, and the insight thus given
into the workings of This Is Your Life. So surprised was Rolf, so
thoroughly astonished by the really totally unexpected honour, that he
flew out of Edinburgh the very minute the parade had ended to
participate in a wholly spontaneous and unplanned recording of the show.
Still, since there were only 300,000 people in Princes Street Aspel
probably didn't have much difficulty finding his man.
Tragic outcome
GIVEN the tricky relationship between devoutness and slaughter -- the
transition from ''Thou shalt not'' to the sophistries of ''Just war''
philosophy eluding many -- it was hardly surprising that the Very
Reverend Keith O'Brien, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Edinburgh, upset
several people at the St Giles' VJ-Day service.
Not content with describing the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as
''war crimes'', the bishop proceeded to lambast Britain's nuclear
defence policies and the practice of trucking nukes along the Edinburgh
by-pass.
Plainly the comparison drawn between scientific mass murder, British
style, and the personalised Japanese variety proved too much for many.
Fellah calls himself a Christian?
But the bish should take heart, not least from the example set by the
deeply secular patriots at Socialist Worker. According to that paper's
analysis of VJ-Day, the Allies did not conduct a war against barbarism
but ''a war of colonial conquest''. Pearl Harbor was ''the pretext the
White House wanted'' while ''the worst war crimes during the war in the
East were not carried out by the Japanese but by the Americans and their
allies''.
All in all, a real tragedy that we won, eh?

BY the time you get to the end of this sentence, seven copies of the
Microsoft Windows computer package will have been sold somewhere in the
world. Tomorrow morning that figure will skyrocket as the new Windows 95
is launched in the biggest, brashest publicity campaign the industry has
ever seen.
Microsoft is being coy about the exact price tag, but no expense has
been spared; no PR rep or industry analyst left unbriefed, no
cheese-and-wine midnight opening left unscheduled. Every copy of
Thursday's Times has been bought by the company and will be distributed
free; Microsoft chairman and founder Bill Gates will give thanks at a
ceremony in Seattle, and the share price has soared in anticipation of
fat profits.
So why all the fuss? In the here-today obsolete-tomorrow world of the
computer, Windows 95 is basically an upgrade to an existing operational
system which allows people to use their machines without having to
program the computer.
''You are right, it's just PC software, and as people are saying it's
not a cure for cancer,'' said Windows 95 senior product manager Anne
Mitchard yesterday. ''But in terms of personal computing it does
represent a watershed. It takes us from the past 15 years of computing
with the restrictions we have had and the design that's been around, to
the next decade of computing.''
For some, however, it may be a step up but it is no giant leap
forward.
''It is true that this variation of windows will make full use of the
hardware technology,'' said William Gillies, information officer at
Strathclyde University's Computer Centre. ''It will be an improvement
and we will get some performance improvements. However, for a lot of
people, the systems they are using are vastly more powerful than they
need anyway.
''Microsoft would love us to buy it as if it's an essential sort of
thing . . . but a lot of people like me are fairly cynical about the
whole thing. In 20 years I have seen about 10 operating systems come and
go and one is very much like another at the end of the day. It's not
going to be a major advance, it's going to be an improvement.''
Across at PC World in Edinburgh's Glasgow Road, sales manager John
Wincott would disagree.
''There's a lot of interest out there in Windows 95, there's a lot of
enthusiasm. People have seen demonstrations of the product and realised
its potential. It's going to help businesses with its speed and
flexibility and it's going to help home users with the same benefits. I
think people will change to 95 just because of the advantages it will
offer such as multi-tasking. It's a huge advance.''
PC World, who are helping the launch of the new package in the UK are
planning a series of late-night openings, roadshows, and demonstrations
to shift the #68 -- plus VAT -- product. London will host a
''Hollywood-style premiere'' in Leicester Square and ads will carpet
every square inch of newsprint and TV pixels.
Wincott dismisses suggestions it's all a little over the top. ''I
think probably this is one of the most exciting launches there's been. I
think it's because Windows 95 is such a friendly package. It sort of
takes the PC much closer to the AppleMac in regards to user
friendliness. Windows earlier versions are still a little bit
uncomfortable to use. 95 has done away with all of that and made it much
easier to use.''
One criticism of the new Windows 95 is that it does take a fairly
strong computer to run it so some users who don't want a new machine may
have to upgrade. Upgrade packages can range from #199 and can include a
bigger memory, a custom-designed keyboard with extra keys, modem, etc.
To buy a new computer which has the Windows 95 package included would
cost around #1200 with an extra #100 added on for a printer.
''I won't move up to the new package immediately because the Windows
package I have at the moment is perfectly adequate for everything I need
to do,'' said one home-based Scottish businessman, who relies on his PC
to keep in touch with colleagues and customers across the globe. ''I
don't really see the benefit of moving up to the next step just for the
sake of it. It's a bit like getting the new football strip the minute it
comes out.''
Another criticism is that the improvements offered in the new software
have been available for years on the Apple Macintosh computer which has
always had a graphical user interface, allowing a point-and-click
simplicity without the need for intricate message commands. ''There's a
joke going around computer circles that Windows 95 is Macintosh 89,''
said one analyst.
Anne Mitchard bristles at such suggestions. ''In terms of that sort of
comment, they probably come from people who have not used Windows 95,''
she said. ''Although there are certain similarities drawn between the
look of the two, when you start to use it you see the wealth of stuff
that Windows 95 is able to do that Macintosh currently does not.''
Whatever the capabilities, the fuss over the new product has been
unprecedented. Mitchard said the key to the hype and hoopla was quite
simply the size of the customer base -- some 80 million people
worldwide. ''The vast majority of computers are PCs that are running MS
Dos or Windows . . . it's going to impact a greater number of personal
computer users than any other system.''
It is the largest single-product campaign that Microsoft has ever
undertaken, she added, and it was as much a celebration of achievement
as a sales effort for the new product. ''It's arrived! it's happening!''
William Gillies, meanwhile, is not too surprised at the accompanying
razzmatazz. ''Microsoft does tend to be a fairly high-profile company,
with a US way of looking at things . . . and they are dependent on
selling new software.''
Even if the new system is a runaway success, one thing is certain --
in a number of years it too will be overtaken by a new and more
innovative product.
Mitchard said Microsoft are already working on upgrades for the
Windows ''family,'' more specifically, the 95 package and a separate
system called Windows NT which is aimed at the corporate user. ''Both
products will continue to be developed and evolve along the very
structured path within this family,'' she said.
William Gillies said the next big thing is an ''object-oriented
operating system''.
''Vast numbers of programming staff are working on this at the moment
and in a couple of years that's going to be the new thing to get and we
won't be happy unless we've got it.''
So, basically, we may see the same launch frenzy all over again not
too far down the road? ''I'm afraid so,'' said Gillies. ''You're
hooked!''

MOSCOW: President Boris Yeltsin did not show up as scheduled to open
an airshow near Moscow yesterday, and his press secretary could give no
reason for the president's absence. ''The president gets many
invitations,'' Sergei Medvedev told reporters in Zhukovsky outside
Moscow.
Yeltsin's press service said the 64-year-old president, who is
recovering from a mild heart attack, was working in Moscow and had
documents to sign.

Hong Kong
VETERANS of Britain's ''forgotten'' fleets who liberated Hong Kong
from Japanese occupation 50 years ago finally got to hold their victory
parade in the British colony today.
With the pomp the British military musters so well, more than 100
survivors of the British Pacific and East Indies Fleets paraded on the
Hong Kong waterfront, where 50 years ago Japanese Imperial Army officers
surrendered their swords.
The strains of Rule Britannia, A Life on the Ocean Wave and the naval
hymn Eternal Father washed over the harbour before a gun salute from HMS
Plover marked a two-minute silence.
The oldest veteran was 89, the youngest 67, but all stood tall in
their blue berets, medals glinting in relentless tropical sunshine that
sent wilting spectators scurrying for shade.
''For 50 years, the British East Indies and Pacific fleets have been
the forgotten fleets,'' said Gerry Purnell, a petty officer on the
aircraft carrier HMS Indefatigable in 1945.
Purnell spent nearly three years planning today's commemoration
ceremony for fleet veterans, the first in a series of events for all the
branches of the military who played a part in the defence and liberation
of Hong Kong.
There were some 500 British ships deployed in the Pacific a half
century ago, the largest number ever in British naval history, Purnell
said.
And their job did not end with the Japanese surrender.
They liberated Hong Kong and Singapore -- at the express orders of
Winston Churchill, who ordered them to get in before the Americans and
Nationalist Chinese could gain a foothold.
Once the war ended, the fleet served as hospital ships, evacuated
prisoners of war from all corners of occupied Asia and shipped in
supplies and normality to war-ravaged allies.
''The Royal Navy certainly did wonders to restore morale and
confidence,'' author Jan Morris wrote of the liberation.
When their job was done, the fleet's ships sailed back in dribs and
drabs, Purnell said.
''They didn't send us back as a victorious armada. We were like the
old lady locked in the lavatory, nobody knew we were there,'' he said.
''We never got the recognition then, but now, we're finally not the
forgotten fleets any more.''--Reuter.

JUAN Escarre, the Spanish centre forward, shut the door on Scotland in
their attempt to secure a place in the play-offs for places five to
eight yesterday in the Nissan European Nations Men's Hockey Cup in
Dublin.
The FC Barcelona player scored one of his side's goals in their 3-0
victory and had a hand in the others by Jan Dinares and Victor Pujol.
The Scottish defence contained the rampant Spaniards until the
fifty-seventh minute when Escarre set up Pujon for their second goal.
The Spaniards should have extended their lead four minutes later.
A rebound from a post by Escarre was picked up by Pablo Garcia, and
his shot in turn was kept out of goal by the feet of Scottish captain
Duncan Low. Garcia took the award but hit a post. Then, showing his
dissent, he smashed the ball into the goal and the umpire sent him to
the sin bin.
Garcia was still cooling his heels when Escarre scored a superb third
goal on the counter attack after the Scots had put together their best
spell. Results:
Group A -- Spain 3, Scotland 0; Holland 1, Belgium 1. Group B --
England 4, Beloruse 0; Ireland 1, Poland 1.

Ayr Utd 1, Dunfermline 2 (after extra time)
DUNFERMLINE scraped through thanks to a goal in the tenth minute of
extra time from Marc Millar.
His shot from 25 yards looked covered by Ayr keeper Billy Lamont but
he let the ball slip through his grasp, much to the delight of the
visiting fans.
Ayr took the lead after 17 minutes when Dunfermline skipper Norrie
McCathie lost possession to Brian Bilsland. He kept his cool before
rounding keeper Guido van de Kamp and sliding the ball home.
McCathie almost made amends immediately with two efforts that hit the
bar in a frantic goalmouth scramble.
Then keeper Lamont made superb saves from Greg Shaw and Jackie
McNamara before being beaten in 42 minutes. Millar made the opening with
a great run down the left. He passed to McNamara, who slotted the ball
home.
Keeper Lamont defied Dunfermline with a string of second-half saves
that forced the tie into extra time.
Dunfermline made their experience count when Millar fired the ball
home from well out.

Flesh-revealing mini-skirts have burst back on to our streets leaving
Anvar Khan wondering if the resurgence is due to the fashion items'
dateless style or just history's cliched habit of repeating itself.
HE mini-skirt is back, and you know what that means. Well-intentioned
girls all over Europe, fulfilling their obligation to keep the fashion
industry turning, will be dutifully flashing their knickers as they
strut the streets in minimalist lampshades for the delight of nobody but
the hormonally imbalanced. (We feature classic examples of the short
skirt which A-line -- if you'll excuse the pun -- themselves more, we
believe, with readers' tastes.)
Some people even want to claim glory for this unfortunate and public
phenomenon. Over the years, arguments have raged as to which designer of
the sixties, the French Andre Courreges or Britain's Mary Quant,
actually invented the mini-skirt.
Courreges was once quoted as saying: ''I was the man who invented the
mini, Mary Quant only commercialised the idea''. Streetwise Quant
acknowledged his egomania: ''That's how the French are . . . I don't
mind, but it's just not as I remember it. Fashion, as I see it, is
inevitable. It wasn't me or Courreges who invented the mini-skirt anyway
-- it was the girls in the street who did it. Designers simply
anticipate what the public wants. Maybe Courreges did do mini-skirts
first, but if he did no-one wore them.''
It was ridiculous of the French couturier to try to outdo her, to take
responsibility for the short hem-line. It's like someone trying to
convince the world that their ancestor invented the wheel, which was not
a question of ingenuity but of timing, for someone would have designed
it eventually.
In fashion, style is not born out of necessity. The micros of the
sixties were merely a vanity, another way of hailing the importance and
power of being young, as only ''youth'' have the gall and bad taste to
wear them. This year, short skirts are again being presented as a vital
ingredient of the new autumn/winter look. Haud-me-back. The Avengers
blonde in knee-high leather boots has returned.
No generation or race or class of women will ever live free of the
notion that youth, short skirts and blonde, Twiggy hair are the ultimate
testimony to glamour. I'm not saying that all blonde women look like
mannequins. I'm merely suggesting that they might. It's the only way
they will be noticed, because men with fame and money and a high libido
are always window-shopping. The constant regurgitation of fashion's past
and proved successes, is epically tiresome.
In India, women who are plump are lauded for their beauty because in
poorer countries chubbiness means health and wealth. In America, Britain
and Europe, the opposite is true. Skinniness is sensual. Nothing
changes. Fashion-lovers are expected to hotfoot it to the shops and buy
leopard skin all over again, the way their mums did when it was their
turn.
Much as I hate irony, there is a huge sense of it in the bimbo look.
The trappings of female impersonation cannot be worn seriously. The
blonde ''babe'' look is camp. Look at Joanna Lumley as Patsy in
Absolutely Fabulous. Supermodel Cindy Crawford, in an interview with
Vanity Fair, who described herself as 'white trash''. The Barbie doll
woman is a desirable woman, primarily because Britain and Europe receive
their intelligence from America.
The Americans are culturally superior. Britain's consumption of
American cultural product is an accurate measure of that country's
economic gumption. The British have developed the same appetite for the
various leisure activities the allies have invented, including Gameboy,
fast food, and Pamela Anderson.
In America, women who conform to the American ideal of blonde
womanhood are rewarded. Theirs is a patriotic commitment and they are
lauded regardless of whether their breasts or colour of hair is natural
or false. Cheryl Tiegs, Christie Brinkley, Daryl Hannah wave the
American flag. Fashion moguls, punters and producers in Britain too,
have an ideal of youth and beauty. They have the sixties.
The fashion media know that the populist Bardot look will ensure
magazine coverage. They don't care that the hair and make-up is
old-fashioned or imported, it will sell. The short skirt and fitted
jacket is a contrived and conservative image. It is not new and it is
not worth aspiring to. Not merely because it's dated, but because it's
cliched. Cliches are a shorthand way, in glamour or in literature, of
saying what you think others want to hear, of playing safe. In fashion
it is an image which no longer has any power.

Clyde 0, St Johnstone 2
TWO goals in five minutes earned a second-round place for Saints at
Broadwood last night.
Saints opened the scoring just after the break with a 15-yard Philip
Scott header from a John O'Neill cross. Five minutes later, a Roddy
Grant run set up a chance for Scott, and although his drive was blocked,
the ball rebounded to O'Neill who scored.
Saints had been in control during the first half and George O'Boyle,
in six minutes, came close to opening the scoring. Then a Grant header
slipped just past.
Clyde lost Gordon Parks after only 45 seconds, carried off with a leg
injury. And in 70 minutes, Kenny Gillies was sent off after a second
booking.

PARTY on, culture vultures. Wayne and Garth's invocation could be the
theme slogan for the Edinburgh Festival. You thought we were all here
for doses of high-octane theatrical thrills, musical moments, and comedy
capers? Well, sure, we are, at least when we can fit the shows in, in
between the parties.
There are parties-a-plenty in Edinburgh at the moment, from the
gold-leafed invitation-only, black-and-white dress code posh do at the
National Galleries to the abundance of impromptu post-show, after-dark
flat parties, where high-spirited thespians wreck the expensive abodes
they have rented from Edinburgh's respected burghers, thus losing their
deposits and being forced to flee the country to escape the resultant
lifetime of debt they would incur to replace the singed Laura Ashley
drapes.
People aren't just fretting about audiences, sets, and reviews.
They're worrying about caterers and frocks. Across town reputations are
being won and lost on the strength of some canapes. It's a ruthless,
stylish, colourful business and I've been watching it enviously, holed
up in a single hotel room where I can certainly throw a cat, if I was so
inclined, and I'm allowed to throw a tantrum, as long as I don't disturb
the other guests (oops, sorry folks), but I cannot throw a party.
Watching others host extravaganzas I've felt sick with longing, but
attempts to persuade my best friend, who has recently taken possession
of a fine two-bedroomed flat in Marchmont, to have a bash instead have
so far proved futile. He refuses to indulge me. Stewart may be a
dedicated party-goer but is far too smart to have one himself; he leaves
that to numpties like me.
Party-givers are a breed apart. It must be in our blood. It is an
absolute truism that in any social grouping there will only ever be one
or two people who throw parties. They will do so on a regular basis,
about twice a year. Everyone else will look forward to these bashes, and
will get quite despondent if none occurs for a while, but they won't
dream of having a party themselves. They know that sooner or later we
will have to satiate our urge.
I've been throwing parties since I could spell the word. I have a
degree in hosting, graduating from the kind of parties where people pass
the parcel to the kind where people pass the joint, from parties where
the guests threw up from too much jelly and ice cream to parties where
the guests threw up from too much cider.
As the years go by my parties have been characterised by less damage
and more alcohol. In student days 22 people would show up with one
bottle of Liebfraumilch and leave with the payphone and, inexplicably,
the stair rods.
Lessons are learned. Ideally you should never invite strangers to your
parties (although you'll be horrified also to witness what your best
friends are capable of getting up to). People who have no personal
connection with you will have no qualms about flicking their ash all
over your vol-au-vents, putting their boots on your bedclothes -- and
occasionally committing more unspeakable acts on your bedclothes --
emptying your fridge of all its contents, even the out-of-date jar of
Hellmans in the back which is no doubt deadly by now (serves 'em right),
filching your favourite CDs and stealing your boyfriend. At times like
that you truly understand the meaning of the song It's my party and I'll
cry if I want to.
Well, someone has to have a good weep at a party; it's as obligatory
as someone spilling red wine on the carpet and someone else ditching a
year's supply of Saxa over the stain before you've had time to say
''Hang on, I don't have a Hoover.''
Damages I've sustained in the past have included one broken guitar --
over-exuberant hippies -- one broken bathroom window, and one broken
heart.
Damages other people have sustained have included second degree burns
-- an unfortunate chap who had earlier broken his nose in a football
match had turned up at my Hallowe'en party to be cheered up but had
promptly leaned against some atmospheric candles and set himself alight,
a spectacular, memorable sight but admittedly not much fun for him -- a
near-severed thumb, courtesy of the broken bathroom window; and a
virulent curse from me, courtesy of the aforementioned stolen
boyfriend/broken heart jape. Nowadays people show more respect for my
property, inevitable sneers about my vinyl collection aside, and bring
so much drink that the following morning my kitchen resembles a branch
of Oddbins. Obviously the only solutionis to throw another party. And so
the chain of parties continues, ad infinitum.
AMATEUR psychologists might claim that this need to throw parties
stems from insecurity, from a desire to be loved, to reassure myself
that I have friends. Not so. Born out of more spiteful motivations --
parties were thrown so I could deliberately NOT invite my primary school
enemies -- they now represent a lust for glory.
Other arts journos might nourish secret desires to write, direct, and
even appear in plays but my creative aspirations are confined to
producing the perfect party. I don't want to write a best seller or win
an Oscar. My ambitions are simpler than that. I'll settle for being
universally acknowledged as the Hostess with the Mostess -- and perhaps
establish a cult as the woman who held the best party in Edinburgh from
the confines of a tiny hotel room. Look out for the invites!

BRAVE programming this for a young band of just two years, but what a
magnificent success the Ulster Youth Orchestra made of the challenge.
After easing their way through a new commission from Philip Flood called
Rising, they were catapulted into a stunning performance of Bernstein's
Symphonic Dances from West Side Story as Alexandre Myrat conducted with
hips, elbows, shoulders, and a complete vocabulary of unfamiliar
left-hand gestures. From the tear-jerking strains of Somewhere through
the wild cacophony of the Mambo and back again, this performance glowed
with vitality.
And just when you thought they must have burnt themselves out with the
intensity of that one, they came back after the interval with a
white-hot Shostakovich 5, blistering with nervous energy. An outstanding
accomplishment.

IT'S no wonder that the National Youth Music Theatre is playing to
packed (and melting) houses: its production of the Bertold Brecht-Kurt
Weill collaboration is stunning, both visually and musically.
The set -- which could have been lifted from a Fritz Lang movie -- is
an expressionist's Soho, and is bathed in rich colours; most memorably
during the whores' Ballad of Immoral Earnings.
Musically, the female singers steal the show; from the powerhouse
Jealousy Duet sung by Polly (Jessica Watson) and Lucy (Esther Shanson)
through to The Solomon Song, a trio number led by the prostitute Jenny
(Tiffany Gore). The unrivalled highlight of this classy production,
however, comes courtesy of Watson's Pollu, and her compelling, knock-out
interpretation of Pirate Jenny.

AT last, a one-man show which is strikingly theatrical. From the
moment Ivan Heng's foot appears from beneath a white canvas screen --
his wriggling, questing toes testing the dramatic waters -- he commands
our attention.
Tripitaka Theatre Company have created a very robust piece, with
excellent lighting, bold sound effects and a great deal of visual flair.
The script, by Heng and Chantal Rosas Cobian, is admittedly less
engaging than Heng's performance, too often finding refuge in weak jokes
and cliched allusion -- particularly a wincing pastiche of the Reservoir
Dogs ear-severing scene -- but his evocation of a journey made from East
to West, from Singapore to London is one rich in emotional and cultural
nuance, suffused with energy and charm.

STIRLING is aiming to capitalise on the success of the William Wallace
movie, Braveheart, by highlighting the town's historic attractions.
Braveheart, starring Mel Gibson, has its European premiere at
Stirling's MacRobert Arts Centre on September 3. Already a hit in
America, it is expected to be a money-spinner on this side of the
Atlantic.
Now a marketing campaign, including a cinema advert, has been launched
to heighten awareness of Stirling as a holiday destination.
The campaign is being developed by Loch Lomond, Stirling and Trossachs
Tourist Board and funded by the Scottish Tourist Board, Forth Valley
Enterprise, Stirling District Council, Central Regional Council, and the
EU.
It includes TV, press, and poster adverts in Germany, features on
French and German TV, holiday competitions in the national press,
cinemas, and pubs, and leaflets distributed to British cinemas.
The campaign will target 20 million potential customers.
The tourist board director, Mr James Fraser, said: ''It is vital that
we grasp the unique opportunity presented by Braveheart with both hands.
This campaign stands to benefit the local tourism industry to the tune
of #10m.''

A SCOTS MP yesterday called for the abolition of capping of local
authority budgets leaving councils to ''sink or swim'' and defend their
spending decisions to the electorate.
Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy, speaking at a debate at the
Edinburgh Book Festival, said the reform of local government within
Scotland was extremely important.
The MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said the Tories had ''shot one of
their own foxes'' by getting rid of a tier of local government.
''The argument against devolution, call it what you want, always was
yet another tier of people like me spending your taxes. That is gone.''
Mr Kennedy said that Mr Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary,
appeared to be looking at local government developing in a more
autonomous way.
''Let's have no capping whatsoever. Let these councils sink or swim
and defend their spending decisions and local tax decisions to the
electorate.''
The possible abolition of the capping of local authority budgets is
known to be under discussion at Cabinet committee level, although the
Treasury remains strongly opposed to the move.
Many Tory activists support the end of capping because they believe
the voters would see high-spending Labour councils in their true
colours.
Speaking at a debate, On The Edge of Europe, chaired by Mr Arnold
Kemp, former editor of The Herald, Mr Kennedy also forecast the next
General Election would be ''the most constitutionally-orientated'' one,
possibly in living memory.
He added that there was the Scottish component, the European component
and the Northern Ireland one.
Mr Paul Scott, the SNP vice president and its spokesman for the arts,
argued that the Union was outdated and made Scotland a politically
peripheral nation.

AN influential Commons committee yesterday heard at first hand the
potential impact of the showpiece Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival on
the British movie industry.
The Parliamentary Select Committee on National Heritage, chaired by
Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, heard how the festival already contributed
both culturally and economically to the industry.
Committee members were in Edinburgh at the invitation of festival
director Mark Cousins, after he had a chance meeting with Mr Kaufman at
the UK premiere of the hit movie Rob Roy in the city earlier this year.
The director said he had hammered home the need for the festival to
show the 60 films made in Britain every year to a worldwide audience.
Speaking after the hour-long meeting, Mr Cousins said: ''My contention
was there is a real wealth of low-budget cinema which is not getting the
audiences it deserves. Because they are low-budget, they could go into
profit quickly and could return funds to the producer, leading to the
continuity of employment for staff within the industry.''
The festival director said such a gathering of British films could
also have a spin-off for tourism and commerce.
Mr Cousins envisaged the New British Expo, launched yesterday morning
as the only comprehensive showcase of British cinema, could grow to a
huge gathering where every British-made film in the year could be viewed
by a worldwide press.
''I hope to have 1000 journalists, backers and programmers from around
the world who will come to Edinburgh to see every British film released
in a year. Hopefully the 60 currently produced would grow with that
success,'' he said.
He also warned Britain could continue to lose out to ''user friendly''
Ireland in the field of film production which offers greater benefits to
film makers, unless action was taken to level the playing field.

calls the Tartan Tax. This would discriminate against all living in
Scotland. So at our peril should we support even the limited form of
assembly proposed by Labour.
He is referring to the proposed power of a putative assembly to raise
or lower income tax by up to 3%. Mr Forsyth's unspoken premise is that
at present we enjoy parity of treatment with the rest of the UK -- that
we all pay tax at the same level. This assumption is false. The fact is
that there are several taxes which penalise Scots and Scottish-based
businesses. The one which does so to Scotland's householders is the
council tax.
Unlike the old rating system which was based upon notional rent, the
current council tax is based directly upon the value of one's property.
This is the case both north and south of the Border. But for those who
live in Scotland there's just one catch. In Scotland we pay more for
houses of identical value to those in England. This fact, largely
unknown, has been one of the best-kept secrets of Scottish politics. Now
is the time to give it an airing because it destroys Mr Forsyth's
premise that tax is uniform under the Union.
When comparing the bills paid north and south of the Border on a pound
for pound basis, we find that for a house worth say #50,000 one would
pay #624 in Scotland but only #475 in England. For a house worth #60,000
in Scotland the bill would be #763 north but only #543 south of the
Border.
You can see just how the council tax system benefits England's
homeowners from the figures shown in the accompanying tables.
It shows council tax bills for the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
Dundee, as well as that in Monklands -- all higher than the Scottish
average. It shows the average bills for houses of identical value north
and south of the Border. There are variations, but in overall terms,
Scots pay more than our English cousins. Why?
The answer is to be found in the Local Government Finance Act 1992.
This provided for a UK tax but with different valuation banding in
Scotland, England, and Wales. Scotland's, set out in section 74, is
shown in the tables.
You will note that the bills in the tables do not include water
charges for which in Scotland there is a separate charge made by local
government, and is of course privatised in England.
What is the justification for different range of values? Unionists
might claim the range of values are different because of the old hoary
chestnut that Scotland is subsidised by England. In fact Scotland pays
her way if all revenue and expenditure is taken into account, rather
than merely identifiable expenditure. But whether or not we receive more
than our fair share, we certainly pay more than it. Under the Union
Scotland's householders pay more than England's.
Weren't we supposed to be paying more tax only after an assembly or
independent parliament were set up? That has been the doom-laden
prophecy from all Tory and indeed many Labour politicians. What do they
say about the high tax which we already experience? Will they say
anything? Ian Lang wouldn't. But Mr Forsyth is different. He takes on
his opponents in the middle of the ring. He cannot duck this punch.
How can he justify Scots paying this Tartan Tax, when he says that we
should never support a political structure which would impose one? Is he
willing to act upon the Tartan Tax we must pay today, and created by his
own party? Or will he continue to warn about the putative Tartan Tax
which he claims we might have to pay sometime tomorrow?
As Secretary of State he has the power to act. He can do so under
section 74 of the Act. By the logic of his own argument he should act to
scrap the Tory Tartan Tax now. Under section 74 he has power to alter
the range of values by laying an order before the House of Commons. He
could move an order that the range of banding be as in section 5, ie
England. But he would not dare because his own party, and many Labour
MPs, would argue that Scotland is feather-bedded, subsidised, and
generally should be grateful.
What of Labour? In Scotland the highest council tax figures are paid
for local authorities run by Labour for years. Yet, in this year's local
government elections in England, Labour boasted that in councils they
controlled the average council tax was lower than those run by the
Conservatives. Do Scottish Labour believe like the Tories that Scotland
must continue to pay this Tartan Tax?
One suspects that whatever George Robertson says in answer to this
will have two features. It will contain invective. And it won't be an
answer. Will he promise to introduce some ''fair'' tax, which as we know
of Labour tax policy is one which has no rates or figures.
What of the SNP? First, we believe that the significance of small
variations in the level of personal taxation is not something which is
likely to lead to mass emigration, middle-income Scots jumping out of
Charlotte Square windows, or the disintegration of the Scottish economy.
The significance has been overblown by a parade of Tory Ministers on day
trips to the north. What our opponents cannot do is on the one hand
claim that higher tax on Scots is a terminal economic illness which must
be avoided at any cost, while continuing to ignore the higher taxation
which already exists at their imposition.
The SNP record where we have enjoyed power is excellent with Angus,
Perth and Kinross, and West Lothian saving up to #116 on a band D house
compared to the Scottish average.
The bottom line is that it's the Union and Mr Forsyth who have given
us this very real Tartan Tax. We are all paying for it now. Each time he
talks of a Tartan Tax he should be asked: ''What about the one we
already pay?''
This article exposes as pitiful hypocrisy the political strategy
pursued by Messrs Lang, Forsyth, and Robertson in defending the Union
and attacking real self-government; pitiful because their exaggeration
of the supposed results of higher tax and dire warnings on independence
insults the intelligence. Hypocritical, because their arguments assume a
level-tax playing field under the Union. And whether it's council tax,
business rates, or income tax, Scotland has had to play uphill against
the wind and rain.
The SNP say we will never get nor should we expect a good deal unless
we can negotiate it ourselves. That requires self-government -- ie
independence.

James McKillop examines the row over the Government's plans for the
railway parcels service
A DOCUMENT leaked to the Labour Party over British Rail privatisation
indicates that the Red Star parcel business will be sold to the current
management for a token #1.
It is hardly surprising that opponents are seeing red over the
giveaway.
Nobody showed the slightest interest in taking British Rail's express
parcels delivery business out of public ownership to keep Tory
privatisation plans for BR on the rails. Nobody that is until the
Government decided that the taxpayer should foot the bill.
The deal will leave BR with a redundancy bill of up to #7m for upwards
of 600 employees who will lose their jobs.
This, Transport Minister John Watts says, is a successful
privatisation sale which will ensure the business carries on and that
the railway will continue to offer a premium, high-speed parcel service.
It will further the Government's aim of combining value for money for
the taxpayer with the best prospects for the railway industry and its
staff, said the Department of Transport. The taxpayer could well think
differently.
It might have been considered the sale of the century were it not for
the fact that the Government had not gone down this particular track
before by ensuring the public purse picks up the tab for heavy debt
before a nationalised industry goes private.
To date, British Airways is probably the most obvious beneficiary of
the Government's largesse in this respect. That company is now flying
high after Margaret Thatcher, when Prime Minister, decided that the
taxpayer should pick up much of its debt before privatisation.
There have been repeated attempts to hive off the Red Star parcels
business from BR, but each one has come to nothing. The last resort was
that the business would eventually be picked up by one of the major
road-delivery operators.
It was at this stage that the cavalry moved in. The Red Star
management team, led by John Holmes, marketing director, came up with a
bid to rescue the Government from what was clearly an embarrassing
situation.
One of BR's 60 non-core businesses, Red Star made an operating loss of
#7.5m last year on a turnover of #25m. Analysts suggest this year's loss
could be as high as #9m.
The management buy-out team is composed of Holmes, who will take on
the role of managing director, and four other equity holding directors,
one of whom will come from accountants KPMG as finance director. The
present boss of Red Star, Richard Eccles, is not involved.
KPMG corporate finance is adviser to the buy-out which is backed by
equity funding from venture capitalists BZW Private Equity and working
capital from TSB Commercial Finance.
Mike Stevens, of KPMG corporate finance, said that the business would
be going down the franchising line. Hence the redundancy programme which
would appear to encompass most if not all employees.
Stevens has been enthusiastic about the business's advantage of speed
over long distances and delivery, with collection points at every
railway station in the country.
''We intend to be complementary to the competition. Already if other
road-based carriers want to get things across the country very quickly
they use the Red Star network. We want to build on these alliances,'' he
said.
The plan has won the full support of the Government and the deal will
now go ahead. Ministers, however, are refusing to comment on the
financial details.
Nevertheless the memorandum leaked to the Labour Party over the #1
cost of Red Star rings true. It also shows that the new owners would get
a year's net subsidy of #1.5m.
In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the Opposition has
now decided to refer the matter to the Commons all-party Public Accounts
Committee.
''It would be far better now to abandon privatisation, restore the
single integrated structure in British Rail, which would enable the Red
Star service to continue to provide the valuable public service it did
in the 1980s'', said Shadow Transport spokesman Michael Meacher.
Meacher alleged: ''The management team which has presided over the
fall from a profitable #70m business to a loss-making #38m business is
now to benefit from the sale.''
Red Star was now a basket case, he claimed, and the taxpayer was going
to be forced into paying the same management team who presided over the
decline to trundle it away.
The management buy-out proposal is clearly a god-send to the
Government, whose spokesmen yesterday attempted to blame Red Star's
losses over the past three years on the recession.
''The Government wants to see the business continue, with a fresh
start under a new private ownership,'' the Department of Transport said.
It is unlikely to appease the public at large.
The Red Star business was first offered for sale in June 1993. Since
then the Government has been involved with various unsuccessful
negotiations to take the business out of BR's hands.
Transport Minister John Watts defending the Government's stance
dismissed the Labour attack, saying Meacher was suffering from the
effects of the summer heat.
It is probable that as the Government pushes ahead with the sell-off,
Ministers might find that public disquiet will turn this into a very hot
issue indeed.

THE death of a 28-year-old man at a house in Rupert Street, Glasgow,
earlier this week, brought the number of probable fatalities directly
attributable to misuse of illegal drugs in Strathclyde to 73 so far this
year.
It is likely that the final number for the year will be well in excess
of last year's 94 deaths, a figure which does not include three
youngsters who collapsed and died after taking ecstasy at raves in Ayr.
It is against this background that Strathclyde police's Operation
Eagle moves towards its enforcement phase next week, amid concern from a
considerable body of opinion on the ground -- particularly among those
working directly with drug users who have sought help -- that the heavy
policing of the drugs culture may have unpredictable and ultimately
damaging effects.
In particular, drugs workers have expressed fears that there will be a
concentration on low-level user-dealers, bringing them into the criminal
justice system and driving what is currently perceived to be fairly
overt street drug dealing further underground.
Heavy interdiction is also expected by many to drive up the price of
drugs and increase adulteration -- making the trade even more lucrative
for major players and increasing the prospect of yet more deaths from
misuse.
The Herald was told yesterday, however, by Assistant Chief Constable
Crispian Strachan, in charge of community relations at Strathclyde
police, that the plan was for Operation Eagle to leave a coherent legacy
for the newly-created drugs action teams.
These are co-ordinating bodies which coincide with health board
divisions and are charged by the Government with drawing together
strategy in individual areas.
Mr Strachan pointed out that a large number of seizures during the
first 90 days of Operation Eagle had been of heroin, disputing the
concept that Temazepam was the major current scourge. Almost two thirds
of the seizures, however, had been of cannabis.
He said: ''I agree with a recent quote from a Metropolitan police
commander, that if we declare war on drugs we are declaring war on our
own children. We automatically lose if we call it a war on drugs.
Enforcement has to be one of a range of responses.
''There is only one distinction between people in the drugs world, and
that is between people who use it and the people who sell it and would
not dream of using it because they are aware of how dangerous it is.
''If our aim is to target these people, then there is a point in
enforcement as part of a range of measures,'' he added.
It would be neglect of duty if Strathclyde police did not at some
point enforce the legislation, seeking to tackle some of those men who
exploit our children. Operation Eagle was emphatically not an ''in, do
it, and out'' police operation.

THE Director of the Edinburgh International Festival said yesterday
that if dance was to flourish in Scotland young people in particular
needed contact with the very best international performers.
Mr Brian McMaster's comments came as he praised an arts project,
involving nearly 1000 aspiring local dancers, hosted by the Mark Morris
Dance Group.
The New York-based artists are teaching their brand of innovative
dance to primary and secondary school pupils, dancing classes, special
needs groups, and senior citizens throughout Lothian in a community
programme sponsored by ScottishPower.
Mr McMaster praised the involvement of the Mark Morris group and
added: ''If dance is to flourish in Scotland, it is vitally important
that our young people in particular, regardless of their ability, are
exposed to the very best international performers.''
Mark Morris, whose group members have spent the last five days working
with pupils at Broughton High School in Edinburgh, said: ''Allowing
young people to experience dance should be a cornerstone of any arts
education programme.''

Bordeaux
FRENCH winegrowers voiced concern today over an advertising campaign
by British anti-nuclear activists urging consumers to boycott French
wines in protest against Paris's decision to resume nuclear testing.
An advertisement shown at cinemas across Britain today shows a sniper
pointing a gun at French President Jacques Chirac's head, groin, and
heart before he shoots at a wine bottle. A voice-over says: ''We must
find a way to stop the French testing.''
''We are worried by this technique which consists of taking French
products hostage each time a decision by the government is disapproved
of,'' said Roland Feredj of the Bordeaux winegrowers' trade association.
''A call for a boycott is an act of economic war,'' he added.
The 30-second advertisement was organised by the British Nuclear Test
Ban Coalition.
Spokesman Marci Lopez-Levy said: ''This is the first cinema ad urging
members of the British public to join a boycott of French goods,
especially wine. It is being aired in 200 independent cinemas across
Britain starting today.''
Chirac's decision to stage eight underground tests between September
and May at Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia has aroused outrage
worldwide.
Britain is the second largest importer of French Bordeaux wines with
more than 17% of volume and sales.--Reuter.

Graeme Smith takes an in-depth lookat the Atlantic area which is
breathing new life into Britain's energy industry
THE first oil arriving in Flotta from the West of Shetland in around
six months will mark a new era in Britain's energy industry. The #550m
development of the Foinaven field is revitalising the now mature
industry but, in the forseeable future, it is not going to provide the
bonanza which some hope.
The stampede to the North Sea in the 1970s, which brought new
prosperity to Scotland and the North-east in particular, will not be
repeated. The oil industry's maturity has made it not only much
thriftier, but wiser and more cautious.
One day, there may be huge riches for places like Scrabster, which is
pitching for a piece of the action, and it might mean wealth for Orkney
or a second fortune for Shetland. But it seems unlikely on the present
evidence.
However, given that it took more than 20 years to make the first
commercial discoveries and that, initially, their full potential was not
realised, anything is possible.
Exploration has been underway West of Shetland since July 1972 when
Esso started the first well but the early results were disappointing
with the exception of the Clair field in the 1970s. It was something of
an enigma and, although it was established there was oil there, no-one
knew how to produce it commercially.
''The technology to understand and develop Clair is only now becoming
available to us,'' said Mr Tom Fyfe, BP's deputy asset manager for the
frontier province. ''It wasn't available when Clair was discovered which
is why it has had a chequered history.''
In spite of the lack of success, the drilling continued every year
except one during the 1980s. Up until 1990, there were 60 exploration
wells and eight appraisal wells drilled and the West of Shetland
frontier was not a particularly attractive prospect. However, in 1990,
BP found Foinaven, even although it did not realise it at first. Its
well caught the edge of the field and it returned in 1992 to drill what
was the real Foinaven ''discovery'' well. It was also in 1990 that
Amerada Hess discovered the Solan/Strathmore field and, following
Foinaven, BP discovered the Schiehallion field just nine miles away.
These discoveries, made in deeper water, changed the perception of the
province which is now regarded by many as the most attractive
exploration area on the UK Continental Shelf, if not in Europe, and
prompted a marked increase in activity. These fields are the biggest to
have been discovered in UK water for some years, but the province is
still very much in the exploration stage and the fields do not compare
in size to Forties, Brent, Piper, and Ninian which sparked off the North
Sea boom.
Foinaven and Schiehallion, with estimated recoverable reserves of
between 250,000 and 500,000 barrels each, come in the bottom quarter of
the UK top 20 fields and not in the same league as the North Sea majors.
''We just don't have the reserves to merit a pipeline,'' said Mr Fyfe.
''The pipelines in the North Sea, the four big ones, all stem from
fields with billion barrel reserves.''
The oil companies, through efficiency and cost cutting initiatives,
now work very closely with each other and the possibility of shared
infrastructure is something which is being constantly monitored by a
forum led by BP, Shell, and Amerada Hess. However, there are technical
as well as financial obstacles to a pipeline.
The West of Shetland finds are in considerably deeper water than the
industry has faced in the North Sea. The technology being developed to
meet these demands will open up global markets for UK companies but it
will mean a departure from the traditional North Sea development pattern
and will not provide much relief for the fabrication industry.
Foinaven sits in 450m of water and Schiehallion in 300m and the
reservoirs, as opposed to being deep pools of black gold, are shallow
and spread over a large area.
''That dictates the sort of technology you use,'' said Mr Fyfe. ''You
can't stand a traditional Forties or Brent type platform in 450m of
water which means you have to use floating systems and that limits the
diameter of any pipeline. While a fixed platform is an ideal base to
take a pipeline, a floating production system isn't.''
Another option would be a tension-leg platform but the wide spread of
the reserves means several wells producing from a single field and that
makes a TLP less suitable.
BP has decided to use shuttle tankers to ship the Foinaven oil to
Flotta, which won the commercial battle against Sullom Voe, for short
term storage before it is sold on the global market. It preferred that
option to sending the oil direct to the market, because the tanker size
would have limited that market to north-west Europe.
So a pipeline seems some considerable way off because the industry
will only consider it to service oil they know is there, not oil which
might be found.
The opening up of a new province is good news for service companies
who have been victims of the declining North Sea market but the West of
Shetland will not mean new service bases springing up along the north
and west coast. Representatives from the Highlands and Islands,
including Scrabster, were meeting BP this week to push their case but
they faced an uphill struggle.
Foinaven and Schiehallion are no further from the established logistic
centres of Aberdeen and Peterhead than the northern North Sea fields
already served from the North-east. Lerwick harbour has already
benefited from the increased activity from seismic vessels and, if the
West of Shetland development extends south and west, opportunities might
be created for ports like Stornoway, Ullapool, and Mallaig.
The western margins have not produced anything exciting but the
Government is keen to promote exploration and there are blocks there in
the seventeenth round of licensing which may encourage new activity.
A betting man might wager a small sum on significant finds towards the
Faroe Islands 160 miles north West of Shetland creating opportunities
for Thorshavn, but a boundary dispute is delaying exploration.
These talks between the Faroes and Britain started in 1978 but, after
only one unsuccessful meeting, they did not resume until 1984. Agreement
still could not be reached and a new round of talks started in 1990 and
is continuing.
If agreement cannot be reached, it may go to the International Court
of Human Justice but that would be costly financially and in time for
both countries. With the Faroese keen to bolster their economy, it may
well be that minds become more sharply focused quite quickly.
In any case, the oil majors will not explore areas of contention until
the dispute is resolved. These waters may be troubled but BP has carried
out extensive research and generally the waters to the West of Shetland
are not as ferocious as is often suggested.
''There is a lot of phooey spoken about the weather in the area,''
said Mr Fyfe. ''It is not a lot worse than in the North Sea. The wave
height and wind speeds are fairly similar. The one major difference is
the currents because of the water depth. The cold Arctic currents from
the north and the warm Atlantic currents from the south overlap and they
put a lot of strain on the equipment and it has to be designed to cope
with this.''
Meeting these technological demands is creating opportunities for UK
companies. It was at Ardersier that the #6m turret, the hi-tech
component in the heart of the Foinaven production vessel Petrojarl IV
around which it will rotate, was manufactured.
The greatest opportunities are probably for the operators of advanced
subsea construction and maintenance support vessels. The West of
Shetland fields are beyond the access depths of divers and the operators
will be heavily dependent on subsea technology.
''The flow lines and manifolds will have to be serviceable without
divers,'' said Mr Fyfe. ''The technology is being developed at some
pace. Major advances have been made, for example, in seismic surveying
with 3D surveying providing far more data about what lies beneath the
seabed.
''In testing Clair, for example, the best production rate we could
obtain in the late 70s and 80s was 1500 barrels a day. In 1990, we shot
the first set of 3D seismic and using that information got test-flow
rates of 7000 barrels per day so, by being able to position the wells as
a result of that information, we were able to obtain a four-fold
increase in production rates.''
There may be numerous problems related to exploration West of Shetland
but with each day more information is being gathered which could unlock
reservoirs of wealth.

* WINDOWS 95 is the next generation in Microsoft computer operating
systems. Basically it's the translator and handler which takes
instructions from the user and passes them on to the microprocessing
brain.
The operating system is designed to perform various functions which
only require the user to point the cursor and tap a key or click on a
''mouse'' and the computer will perform a task, print a document or
store a letter, or draw a picture. This saves the user having to
programme every function.
Windows 95, offers more modern facilities including Plug and Play, a
system which automatically detects and aligns itself to work any
hardware, like modems, printers, faxes or CD-Roms. At present, users
often have to use complex instructions to make these machines work.
The system also uses the processor more efficiently by sending it
twice as much data at a time and it can also run several programs at
once, for example allowing a user to write a letter while another
program is printing off a report and a third is making a complex
mathematical calculation.
For beginners, the system will be easier to use than its predecessors,
and faster than any of them, so long as the microprocessor is powerful
enough.
It will also contain an automatic access programme to get on to the
Internet, and the operating speed will allow a quantum leap forward in
computer games, bringing arcade games in to the home.
Because of Microsoft's huge domination of the market -- an estimated
70 million versions of Windows are installed in PCs throughout the world
-- Windows 95 will sell in huge amounts.
It is the automatic step forward in the superfast evolution of
processing. As computers become more powerful, operating programs get
bigger to cope, forcing new developments.
In computing, all new things are soon obsolete. Windows 95 will be
overtaken by bigger and better systems, but for now it seems certain to
dominate.

DAVID BELCHER wonders which comedians will take home a Perrier
COMEDIANS all across Edinburgh were yesterday displaying a studied air
of sang-froid prior to the announcement later today of the Fringe's
most-coveted, most-publicised awards.
''Getting your name on the Perrier short-list? You've more chance of
winning the National Lottery,'' quipped one.
''Or of getting a hip-replacement on the NHS,'' jested another. ''Or
of getting a straight answer on anything out of Michael Barrymore,''
added a third.
Such humour masks a simple truth: every Fringe comedian knows that a
Perrier nomination has little concrete bearing on a performer's
long-term success, yet nevertheless they'll all be cut to the quick if
they aren't among today's half-dozen or so favoured names.
This year's judges will have had their work cut out in reaching a
decision. There are lots of accomplished comedy performers in Edinburgh
in 1995, but few outstandingly-original new ones.
Among the nominees I would therefore hope to see our own Fred
MacAulay, along with Rich Hall and Diane Ford, two skilled and seasoned
American stand-ups making their Fringe debuts. There should also be
placings for Sean Lock and his kung fu absurdism; Bill Bailey's
dispatches from rock's seamy under-garments, and the cartoon physicality
of the Umbilical Brothers.
And it would be rather nice if there was a long-overdue short-listing
for the Fringe's veteran raunch-hand Jenny Eclair.
Additionally, it would be fitting, if somewhat ironic, to hand a
best-newcomer award to Chicago's Second City group, making their
Edinburgh debut in a nightly season of performances at the Fringe Club.
Admittedly, the Second City organisation is 35 years old -- but
without their pioneering work in improvisational comedy-theatre, leading
to the creation of a notable amount of Hollywood stars, American TV and
film wouldn't be the worldwide cultural force it manifestly is.
Meanwhile, the name of one award-winner was announced yesterday.
Julian Barratt is the first winner of the #1000 Open Mic competition,
designed to aid stand-ups who have already progressed a few rungs up the
comedy industry's ladder. Barratt's prize also includes a Radio 1
contract.
He is currently appearing in the Comedy Zone at the Pleasance.

Ken Smith looks at the options being mooted to finance a Scottish
Parliament
IN the end, it's always money they fall out about. Whether it is
couples discussing a separation or lottery winners trying to keep their
relatives happy, money frequently comes between them.
And so it may be with the Scottish parliament. It may not have gripped
the imagination of the public just yet, but for constitutionalists
working out how a Scottish parliament would actually work, it is one of
the most fascinating of subjects -- just how would the parliament get
the money it would want to spend.
Back in 1990, the Scottish Constitutional Convention -- the body made
up of the Labour Party, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, trade unions,
local authorities and community groups -- thought they had it worked
out.
In order to have a degree of stability, a devolved Scottish parliament
should have money it could rely on -- assigned revenues it is called.
This would be all the income tax paid by Scots and all the VAT paid in
Scotland.
A Westminster Parliament could not interfere with this cash, which is
the principal attraction of such a system. Actually working out what VAT
is paid in Scotland is not that easy, as British companies making their
VAT returns do not identify the amount coming from their Scottish
outlets. But no doubt a reasonable guess can be made.
These substantial assigned revenues would thus underline the supposed
independence of a Scottish parliament from Westminster. Convention
members are very keen that a Scottish parliament should be as
free-standing as possible in order to head off Scottish Nationalists'
jibes that it would be little more than a large local authority.
The tricky thing though, is that adding these two totals may actually
be less than the #14,330m the Scottish Office already spends in
Scotland. So an additional topping-up sum would be negotiated with the
Westminster Treasury to pay for the assessed needs in Scotland.
Then, again to underline the parliament's independence, the convention
went a step further, and said that in addition, the Scottish parliament
could vary the rate of personal income tax paid by residents in Scotland
by up to 3p in the pound, up or down.
So this was the package Labour, the Lib-Dems, and the other supporters
of the convention were agreed upon.
But now the bickering starts. Or at least behind the scenes. Unity is
still the watchword of the convention when it puts on its public face.
There are those in the Labour Party though -- we're talking supporters
of Tony Blair here -- who say this is unnecessarily complicated. If you
are going to negotiate with the Treasury for some of the money, why not
just negotiate for the whole lot? The argument against that thinking, is
that Westminster would still be pulling the purse-strings.
Labour argues in return that no Westminster Government would be so
morally bankrupt that it would deprive Scotland of what it morally
deserved. Up to a point Lord Copper, one would have to say to that one.
So far the mainstream of the Labour Party would still allow a Scottish
parliament to vary income tax, but those sensitively tuned to the latest
thinking in the Blair camp say they are picking up signals which suggest
that Blair's supporters are less keen on actually applying the
principle.
No point in playing into the Tories' hands of confirming Scotland as
the highest-taxed part of the United Kingdom, they are discreetly
murmuring.
Their partners in the convention, the Liberal Democrats, plus the
nationalist-leaning wing of the Scottish Labour Party, are not so keen
on simply negotiating a block grant from the Westminster Treasury. They
fear endless arguments ahead, and are keen to keep some form of assigned
revenues in the plans for a Scottish parliament.
The more forward-thinking Lib-Dems ultimately want a confederation in
Britain. No, that doesn't mean we'll all have to buy Elvis records and
drive pick-up trucks. What they mean is that they eventually would want
all the money raised in Scotland from every form of taxation kept in
Scotland, with the Scottish parliament then negotiating with Westminster
over how much Westminster would need to pay for the powers it was
eventually left with.
The idea of Westminster holding out the begging bowl to Scotland
rather than the other way around has its attractions. But sadly like
many Lib-Dem policies, people suspect it works rather better on paper
than in reality.
So while the phrase assigned revenues means not a blind thing to most
Scots, it could be the point at which Labour and the Lib-Dems fall out
over the Scottish parliament. But again they probably won't. All those
involved actually enjoy working out a form of words which will somehow
encompass both points of view and keep everyone on board that stately,
but slow-moving ship, the Constitutional Convention.
They should not become too smug about it though. As Campbell Christie,
general secretary of the STUC, told the convention on St Andrew's Day,
five years ago: ''We must now turn our attention to winning the Scottish
people to our plan.''
Some might argue that the consitutional pedants have forgotten to do
just that.

HEALTH chiefs who refused costly experimental treatment to a young
cancer victim will decide at the end of the month whether to resume
caring for her.
The 11-year-old girl, known as Child B, is making a remarkable
recovery from leukemia after undergoing a bone-marrow transplant and
chemotherapy at a private clinic.
She was at the centre of a bitter legal battle five months ago after
being denied the treatment on the NHS because her chances of survival
were thought to be slim. The #75,000 operation was paid for by an
anonymous benefactor.
The girl's progress will be assessed next week by Dr Peter Gravett,
who led her life-saving treatment at the London Clinic. Health chiefs
will then decide whether she can return to the NHS.
Mr Robert Jefford, of the Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Commission,
denied there had been a change of policy because the treatment had
worked.
''We will provide funds for further treatment,'' he said. ''But we
will not fund experimental and unevaluated treatment except in the
context of ethically-approved clinical trials.''
Child B, from Cambridge, has been well enough to continue her
chemotherapy at home and has even been mountain-biking and shopping in
France. Her chances of a complete recovery have risen from 10%-20% to
30%.

SOCIAL Security Minister Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish yesterday
promised to raise with Scottish managers the issue of the high sickness
rate among workers in his department.
Lord MacKay was in Paisley to open the new #5.2m social security
office in Lonend.
It emerged yesterday that the huge Department of Social Security
accounted for almost a third of all days lost in central Government.
Lord Mackay admitted a problem existed within the Benefits Agency. He
blamed stressful work and poor working conditions for staff sickness.
He was told that sickness rates in Renfrew were relatively low but
promised to discuss the matter further with Scottish managers.
He said: ''I suspect there are a lot of organisations, where there's
an interface with the public, which are liable to suffer more
stress-related conditions. In some tough jobs people may be more likely
to stay in bed for a day, whereas in less stressful jobs they would just
soldier on.''
Lord MacKay added that purpose-built office accommodation, such as the
Paisley centre, could reduce the problem.
He said: ''A building such as this helps because people may feel
happier about coming in even when they are not one hundred per cent.
Good working conditions are important for everyone -- staff and
customers alike.''
Paisley managers said there was no single reason for absence from work
but added that working environments had been steadily improving over the
years.
Lord Mackay also paid tribute to the Paisley workers for their quick
action during last December's floods in the town, although he admitted
that up to 20 families had still not been rehoused eight months after
the freak storms.
Lord MacKay said: ''Staff here really went out of their way to help
those people who were badly affected by the flooding. We are proud that
our staff played an important part in the emergency operation. They are
often our greatest asset and in this case their dedication was above and
beyond the call of duty.''
The Benefits Agency claimed red tape was kept to a minimum after the
flooding. Staff set up emergency centres and gave out cash grants to
victims.
But it emerged yesterday that up to 20 families, from an original
total that ran into hundreds, were still waiting to be rehoused. Staff
said some houses were so badly damaged that they had almost been
rebuilt, causing delays for householders.

Rio de Janeiro
A BRITON and a Nigerian being held for alleged drug trafficking
escaped from their ground-floor cell in the federal police headquarters
in downtown Rio yesterday.
They were identified as Albert Hines, a Briton who was arrested at Rio
international airport in April, and Christopher Isinanen, 35, a Nigerian
who was arrested last month.
Hines was found guilty of drug-running and faces up to 15 years in
jail. He was arrested as he and two other British citizens tried to
board a plane with 15lb of cocaine in the false bottom of two suitcases.
Isinanen was arrested after two British women, Karla Webster, 18, and
Andrea Armstrong, 19, detained for trying to smuggle cocaine through
Rio's airport told police he had supplied them with the drugs. His trial
was under way when he escaped, the spokeswoman said.
Police in Rio say they have seen an increase in recent years in the
number of foreigners, particularly British citizens, attempting to
smuggle cocaine out of the country in an operation dubbed the Nigerian
Connection.

Jerusalem
ISRAEL and the PLO resumed talks on widening Palestinian self-rule in
the West Bank today after the Jewish state buried victims of an Islamic
militant suicide bombing in Jerusalem.
''We are going to try to achieve as much success as possible during
this round. We will work in a very intensified manner,'' said chief
Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Korei.
Five people, including the bomber from the Islamic Resistance Movement
Hamas, were killed and 100 were injured yesterday when a bomb blew up an
Israeli bus in Jerusalem.
Similar bombings had killed 77 people since Israel and the PLO signed
their 1993 Israel-PLO framework peace accord until yesterday's attack.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered negotiators at Israel's Red Sea
resort of Eilat to halt talks until after the victims were buried.
One of the victims, a 26-year-old Israeli woman, was buried last
night. A police officer was buried in a private ceremony this morning.
The funeral of an American tourist was due to have taken place in the
afternoon.
The bodies of a man and a woman have yet to be identified. Police say
either one could have been the bomber.
An Israeli official said negotiators would hold round-the-clock
sessions in an effort to complete an agreement before September 24, the
beginning of the Jewish New Year.
This morning, President Ezer Weizman called on Israel and the PLO to
abandon the step-by-step autonomy experiment in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and negotiate a final agreement now.
Weizman told the daily newspaper, Maariv, that the Israeli Government
must realise that its strategy of talking peace amid the violence and
leaving the big questions unanswered was not working.
''It has to be understood that we are fighting against a Hamas force
that is amid the Palestinians. I'm not sure that (PLO leader Yasser)
Arafat is able to solve this problem,'' he said.
Arafat accused Iran of funding Islamic fundamentalists to carry out
suicide attacks in order to derail the talks.
''Iran is the one that announced they are supporting such attacks, not
me,'' Arafat said. ''Iran knows how much they are paying to carry out
these attacks.''
Arafat, speaking with reporters after meeting with German Development
Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger in Gaza City, also said Palestinian and
Israeli extremists were collaborating to halt the peace process.
''We have several documents to prove the co-ordination,'' he said.
''There are fanatics on both sides.''--Reuter.

ITV viewing figures have hit a new low but managers blame a summer
blip.
BBC1 chiefs have been rubbing their hands over Broadcasters' Audience
Research Board viewing figures showing them narrowing the gap with ITV
over the past six months.
Now, the latest figures show ITV at a fresh low of 33.8% of total
audience hours in the week ending August 13 compared to 30.1% for BBC1.
BBC sources said it was the lowest ITV share since the current method
of compiling BARB figures was introduced in July 1991.
ITV's average over the year has been 37.1%, compared with 39.9% for
the same period in 1993 and 39.5% last year, a BBC spokeswoman said.
But an ITV spokeswoman said: ''It's just a blip. This time of year
people are on holiday, and we tend to experiment with programme ideas.
Sometimes they work out and sometimes they don't.''
She added that BBC1's share for the week was also below average.
BBC2, with 14.1%, showed well over the period, chiefly because of
world athletics coverage.

Sarajevo
THE UN's Rapid Reaction Force opened fire on Serb gunners tonight
after they attacked the Bosnian capital, killing six people and wounding
about 40.
Among the injured were two children and six Egyptian peacekeepers,
whose observation post was directly targeted by Serb mortar fire.
French troops in the RRF on Mount Igman retaliated for the attack on
the post, firing six shells from 155 mm guns at Serb mortar positions,
said UN spokesman Major Guy Vinet.
The Serb guns went quiet after the French opened up with their 155mm
guns. Some 500 British and French troops in the reaction force are
deployed on Igman to protect UN peacekeepers, convoys and buildings in
the Sarajevo area.
Earlier a huge blast shook the western suburbs, destroying an
industrial building and setting an apartment block on fire. Four floors
of a five-storey building collapsed after apparently being hit by a
rocket.
Renewed fighting and rising tension among warring factions swept
Bosnia and neighbouring Croatia while the US mourned three envoys killed
in Bosnia and worked to rebuild its Balkan peace mission.
Croatian troops were ''battle ready'' around the Adriatic port of
Dubrovnik and could strike Serb gunners in the hills above at any time,
UN officials said.
In Washington, senior officials were meeting to rebuild a mediating
team for the Balkans. Three of the five-strong US delegation died in a
car crash on a mountain road near Sarajevo on Saturday.
Defence Secretary William Perry, National Security Adviser Anthony
Lake, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher want the peace mission
back in Europe next week to keep up momentum.
But while Washington reconstituted its team, Croatian army troops and
Bosnian Serb gunners prepared for a showdown on the southern Croatian
coast. ''Our assessement is they (the Croatians) are battle ready and
could strike at any time,'' UN military spokesman Major Don Roy said.
About 10,000 Croatian troops have massed near the historic port of
Dubrovnik and Bosnian Serbs have sent reinforcements and dug in for a
fight. It was unclear whether Croatia would strike to drive the Bosnian
forces out of range of Dubrovnik or would give the American initiative a
chance.
President Bill Clinton and his administration are concerned the US
initiative, begun earlier this month, could miss a window of opportunity
if they do not move quickly. Clinton will interrupt a vacation in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, tomorrow to attend memorial services for the
envoys at Arlington National Cemetery.--Reuter

A RICH seam of new Scottish talent is being lost because of lack of
funds, the chairman of the Scottish Arts Council, Mr Bill Brown, said
yesterday.
Speaking at a breakfast organised by the Scottish Conservative Arts
and Heritage Committee and attended by Scottish Arts Minister, the Earl
of Lindsay, Mr Brown said that despite an increase of 23% in real terms
in Government funding, and a 130% increase from local government, such
investment in the arts in Scotland had created ''ideas, talent, and
aspirations which our current funding levels simply cannot sustain''.
''In the area of projects and scheme funding, as I mentioned before,
nearly #7m worth of imaginative new ideas and artistic talent is going
to waste because we do not have the funds to support them,'' claimed Mr
Brown.
He warned Lord Lindsay that the SAC could face a cash crisis in
attempting to maintain existing funding levels.
''Despite the growth in funding from the early 1980s, the last two
years have seen below inflation settlements, and we are told to plan on
cash standstill for the next three. With inflation at around 3%, by the
end of three years we will have lost over #2m.
''We will simply be unable to sustain the basic infrastructure for the
arts in Scotland, far less invest in its future.''
Mr Brown also expressed fears about local government reorganisation
which, he said, could have a dramatic impact on arts funding.
Lord Lindsay, who addressed 250 representatives of the arts at the
early morning ''think tank'', said he was happy to listen and consider
the points which had been raised.
''However much money is made available, there will always be claims
that there is not enough to go around,'' he added.
Lawyer Richard Findlay, of Tods Murray, a legal firm which heavily
sponsors the arts, told the gathering that corporate sponsorship had
fallen in Britain from #65m in 1992, to #56.38m in 1994, although levels
in Scotland had remained steady.
Meanwhile, it emerged that Lothian Regional Council is considering
banning private cars from the centre of Edinburgh for up to four days
during next year's festival.
It would mean that only buses, and possibly taxis, would be allowed
into the area during the long weekend.
The council accepts there are problems associated with the scheme,
such as looking after residents and businesses in the area, but says
something must be done -- not only next year, but for the long-term
future -- to stop Edinburgh grinding to a halt.
Councillor David Begg, chairman of Lothian Region's transportation
committee, said: ''The type of traffic problems we are seeing in
Edinburgh during the Festival are going to be the norm for 12 months of
the a year, in 10 years time.''

GERRY Brown's nose is a legend among old-school newspaper
professionals in Glasgow. In and around Fleet Street it has also been
his insignia for more than 30 years. He has pushed it into the affairs
of celebrities, and pitted it against the world's trouble spots.
Hard-nosed approach. Always a nose for a story. He has had it broken
four times.
In the Printer's Pie, a watering hole a few hundred yards from the Old
Bailey where the often-interchangeable triumverate of former cops,
hacks, and robbers can still meet, Gerry Brown has his favourite cockpit
seat at a canopied table above the bar. He can spin a yarn, make himself
available for a useful contact who will know where to find him or keep
an eye on the door for the arrival of old cronies. The industry may have
made a tactical withdrawal across London, leaving Fleet Street to
discreet Japanese banks and smoothie advertising agencies, but the
flattened nose of Gerry Brown is a defiant statement of resistance and
survival. This is still his rendezvous.
At 52 he is too robust to have entered the truly veteran stage, and
neither has early retirement from the News of the World last year left
him ready to submit to quiet respectability -- even if he sits here at
his table with the Times crossword, modulates his Govan accent and
carries himself with the lived-in look of an ex-officer who might have
seen mercenary combat. The reality is not so different.
He has gone freelance, not for the first time in a career that has
spanned staff jobs on both sides of the Border, both sides of the
Atlantic, and both sides of the media, print and broadcasting.
Today he specialises in assignments from which editors and news desks
would prefer to keep from a squeakier, cleaner generation of
college-trained staff. They call up Gerry Brown for some grit. He is
their man for ''hairy-arsed'' investigations, to use his frank
assessment of his own usefulness.
''If I can come in with two or three stories a year I can quite easily
make the equivalent of a very good staff wage,'' he continues. ''I'm
able to sell these because editors think to themselves, 'I'd better have
something slightly worthy'. Old-fashioned stuff. Corruption and stuff
like that. Otherwise, they're quite happy to go with Gazza, Pamela
Anderson, Bob Geldof and Paula Yates. They don't need old rascals like
me for that.''
His trademark is exposure. Not babes and topless royals, but political
exposure. Public interest exposure. In the London tabloids the
distinction is necessary, although he was once exposed himself in
Private Eye as the ''doctor'' under the sheets with a ''patient'' for a
stunted picture to illustrate someone else's feature on sex therapy in
America. The photographer had caught him at a low ebb, doing his
expenses after a foreign assignment that had not gone well.
He is the man who broke the story of Jeffrey Archer and the prostitute
Monica Coghlan. He revealed Pamela Bordes, Commons researcher and
confidante with a security pass, as a prostitute. The kidnap of Ronnie
Biggs was an exclusive that took him out to the Caribbean. After
sweating interviews out of dope dealers, setting up teams with telephoto
lenses, mobile phone scanning, radio transmitters and earpieces, then
arming himself with phonecall transcripts, he confronted Frank Bough
with evidence of cocaine parties in vice dens to wrap up another famous
scoop.
It was Bordes who gave him some unexpected career advice when he was
tracking her story, posing in a hotel as a property dealer. She said he
should consider going into journalism. Taken aback, and trying to
maintain his cover, he replied that he had met a few journalists in his
time. They were all ''lying, devious shits''.
If so, he must be a prince among liars. Yet within his fraternity, he
will insist on codes of honour towards contacts and ''subjects'', as he
prefers to call the people at the centre of his investigations, avoiding
the currency of ''victims'' or ''targets''.
It upsets him, almost 35 years after the event, that a former copy-boy
at the Scottish Daily Mail should remember losing a story to a Gerry
Brown by-line. The boy brought in the story. Young reporter Brown stole
it for himself. In mitigation, he recalls that in his first week on the
paper in Edinburgh he hardened up quickly when a Daily Record reporter
disappeared in a car with the collect picture Brown had obtained.
''My only reputation in Fleet Street is possibly for hard drinking and
causing the occasional problem in bars, but no worse than that,'' he
reflects. ''It's a different breed now. They all come out of journalism
colleges from Stevenage and places like that. Daunting, humourless
people in ill-fitting suits. This is just a staging post for them to get
into telly.''
In publishing a book on his exploits, Exposed! Sensational True Story
Of Fleet Street Reporter*, he knew that he was setting himself up. The
sub-title might have been adapted as Confessions Of A Gorbals Hack by
interviewers, of which there has been an uncomfortable deluge.
''I've become a media target for every tabloid excess, from Elton John
to the break-up of the marriages of lottery jackpot winners,'' he says
ruefully.
His own assessment of the book is not so much modest as aggressively
dismissive. Three decades of by-lines in the Scottish Daily Mail and the
Daily Record, to the Star, the Sun and the most ''surreal'' tabloid of
them all, the National Enquirer in America, have disabused him of any
preening egotism over his work. ''This book is just a collection of
self-serving anecdotal trivia,'' he suggests, unfairly.
Three chapters too short because of a missed deadline, he insists, and
more publisher's insistence on celebrities than he would have liked.
His only self-indulgence is, like all reporters, to nark a little
about the good bits that were cut from the book or never got the show
they deserved. He is proud of the professional achievement involved in
some of these lesser episodes. There was the exercise to buy assault
weapons in the wake of the Hungerford slayings, resulting in the arrest
of a gun dealer in Epping and four paragraphs in the paper. His
investigation into civil service junior officials accepting Florida
holiday bribes from contractors was quickly forgotten. No celebrities,
he shrugs.
His most frightening moment, worse than two spells in Northern Ireland
or the crossfire in any of the world's trouble spots, was driving a van
through Possil in Glasgow at the height of the Ice Cream War. It was
more than his nose that he risked that night. His piece made a page lead
that dropped after two editions.
Glasgow bred him, a Gorbals kid who moved with the family to Penilee,
and Glasgow first sharpened his news instincts, a Daily Record copy-boy
chasing his first ambulances to cover for night-duty reporters who had
passed out. A demi-mode of basket cases and tremendous professionals, he
says of Glasgow at the turn of the sixties. He has returned to it at
various stages in his career, as a crime reporter, freelance operator,
television reporter and newsreader.
He still rates the city with gratitude, affection and respect. ''For
the last of the good old school of print journalism, or maybe just the
attitude towards it, Glasgow is still the place,'' he believes.
''Glasgow is now Fleet Street because, geographically, people have not
split up and you still meet journalists from all the different titles on
the same territory.''
Glasgow has also been his passport. Experience of working there
represented immediate credentials. He walked into his first agency job
in South London with just a mention of the city. And it was the
reputation of Glasgow journalism that opened doors in the United States.
It gave him street credibility in the East End of London, and nominated
him for his first assignment for the old Daily Sketch in Northern
Ireland, on the grounds that he was the only one in the office who would
be able to interpret Ian Paisley's accent.
Wherever in the world he was stuck on a story, there would be a Jock
journalist to demonstrate the benefits of belonging to one of the
strongest mafias in international journalism.
''It might be the old colonial instinct,'' he speculates. ''We're not
afraid to go anywhere. If you've been brought up in Govan, the jungles
of South America hold no terrors, and you'll soon hear a Belshill
accent. The other thing is that Scots are perceived as tough, even if
you're sh***ing yourself. So you can play to that. Outsiders add to that
stereotype all the time.''
Especially if you add several layers of broken nose to it. So, how did
it get smashed? Freelance photographer George Wilkie, an old colleague
and buddy, thinks Gerry's professional nose was stronger than his
reflexes. He remembers an ashtray sailing over the crowd in a Glasgow
bar, picked up on every radar except Gerry's, and it was a stitches job
up at the Royal while the severed nose was held in place.
The other time, Wilkie was with Gerry on a job for the News Of The
World. They had gone down to Ayrshire to interview the 17-year-old boy
who was to marry his teacher. They walked up the path of a tidy
bungalow. The boy came to the door, grinning. Gerry introduced himself.
The boy smacked him on the nose, crunching cartilege and bone as
Wilkie's motor drive shot three frames from the hip.
''I'd spent years confronting gangsters, irate fraudsters, even
terrorists who never leave home without a little something in their
shoulder holster,'' writes Gerry Brown in his book. ''I'd been pushed,
shoved and threatened, even shot at, but never in a personal, vindictive
sort of way. Normally I never suffered any more than a faceful of abuse,
touch wood. Now I'd been battered and bloodied by a schoolboy.''

<RECORDNO>976748669</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MEDIEVAL boat will be raised tomorrow from a muddy grave where it
has lain for 700 years.
Archaeologists believe the find is the most important of its kind in
Britain for more than a quarter of a century.
Civil engineers will use a special lifting cradle to ease the remains
of the ancient hull in the Severn Estuary on to a barge before bringing
it ashore.
About half of the original 50-ft long boat has survived, with its
lower timbers well preserved by the thick mud 500 yards out in the
estuary.
Mr Rick Turner, of the Welsh Office historic monuments body, Cadw,
which funded the excavation, said: ''This is an important and exciting
discovery. Early indications are that it was once an elegant merchant
boat. The quality of carpentry is very high indeed and obviously a very
fine example of medieval boat-building''.
Tree-dating tests indicate construction in the 13th century. The boat
is clinker-built, with overlapping planks fastened with iron nails.
The craft, with an 8-ft beam, was found by chance last year at Magor
Pill, Gwent, on the Severn Levels, close to the site of a new #300m
Second Severn Bridge due to open next spring.
Iron-ore fragments in the hull suggest it was used as a bulk cargo
carrier between the Forest of Dean and the Bristol Channel coast before
it either sank or was abandoned.
Mr Derek Upton, a volunteer nature reserve warden, spotted the boat by
chance. He was showing German visitors the Severn Estuary mudflats at
low tide when he noticed what appeared to be the outline of a ship
protruding from the silt.
He pointed it out to officials of the Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological
Trust, which began a year-long research and excavation project.
Mr Upton, 50, of nearby Caldicott village, works at Llanwern
steelworks, and is the local expert on the mudflats and their wildlife.
The treacherous, shifting Bedwin Sands have been his ''back garden'' for
most of his life.
Over the years he has turned up nine palaeolithic hand axes and
prehistoric human footprints preserved in clay. His other discoveries
include iron-age settlements at nearby Gold Cliff and the remains of an
aurochs, an extinct ox-like creature which once roamed Britain.
Tomorrow's delicate operation will be undertaken by Laing-GTM, main
contractors for the Second Severn Crossing, which is providing free
expertise and equipment.
The lift, supervised by an archaeological team, is expected to take
several hours. The site is only exposed at low tide and there are
notoriously strong Bristol Channel currents.
Once on dry land, the boat will be taken by road to Cardiff, where it
will be kept in a giant tank during four years of cleaning and
conservation.
It is destined to become a major attraction at the National Museum and
Gallery in the Welsh capital.

Moscow
RUSSIAN and Chechen leaders said today they were determined to keep a
fragile peace process on track despite serious clashes in the central
town of Argun.
Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav Mikhailov, head of the Russian
delegation to peace talks, said his team was ''ready at any moment'' to
begin talks with supporters of Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev.
Chechen military commander Aslan Maskhadov blamed Moscow for the
fighting, in which Russian special forces recaptured a police station
from a group of 250 rebels.
Tass quoted him as saying that if the Russians took any similar
action, ''we will be forced to move our volunteers into the mountains
and prepare for military action''.
However Maskhadov also said the rebels had been wrong to seize the
police station on Sunday night. He said the clash had involved forces
from both sides who were not interested in resolving disputes by
peaceful means.
The incident was the most serious between Moscow's forces and rebels
since both sides signed a military accord on July 30.
Mikhailov insisted the rebels disarm in line with the deal and
strongly hinted that Moscow could mount more attacks.
''If the disarmament process does not go ahead and provocations like
those in Argun continue, the question will be decided by other means,''
he said.
Interfax earlier quoted Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as
saying Moscow would punish those who staged ''provocations'' in
Chechnya. He added, however, that the peace process would not be halted
by the incident.
President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary also made clear the clash
would not be allowed to derail peace talks.
''I think that it complicates the negotiations but I do not think it
means the start of a major war again,'' Sergei Medvedev told reporters.
Russia's military leader in Chechnya, Lieutenant-General Anatoly
Romanov, was due to meet Maskhadov in Grozny tomorrow, the agency said.
Up to 80 Chechen fighters were killed when troops backed by artillery
and helicopters retook the police station yesterday, news agencies
reported.
Interfax said only one Russian serviceman was killed and 12 were
wounded in the storming.
Thousands of people have been killed and many more have lost their
homes in more than eight months of fighting since Moscow sent in troops
to end Chechnya's drive for independence.--Reuter.

AN airline took some of the shine from a young Highland dancer's joy
at winning a case-full of silverware in her first Highland Games in
Canada.
When 11-year-old Darra Wood, of Cameron Road, Tain, turned up at
Toronto Airport to fly home, officials of Canada 3000 said the weight of
her hard-earned trophies took her over her 20kg limit and charged her
#21 for excess baggage.
It meant Darra did not have enough money to buy her mother, Gail, a
present from the duty-free shop. She was left with only C$4,
approximately #2.
However, the airline has now apologised to Darra over the incident
which happened last month, refunded her money, and promised to look
after her if she flies with the firm again.
Mrs Wood said: ''I couldn't believe the airline could be so
hard-hearted, especially with a wee girl who was travelling alone.''
She wrote to Canada 3000 and this week received an apology and a
refund from UK marketing manager, Ms Roxanne Jacques.
Ms Jacques also wished Darra the best of luck when she competes in the
1997 North American championships in Nova Scotia.

Srinagar
INDIAN authorities today received new photographs and a tape recording
of four Westerners held by guerrillas in Kashmir indicating they were
all well.
A senior Indian source said the four hostages kidnapped by the shadowy
Al-Faran group seven weeks ago looked well in the pictures, dated August
18.
They did not say what the hostages had said on the recording, but
indicated that all four had spoken on the tape.
The new pictures and recording followed an Indian Government request
to Al-Faran last week to provide concrete evidence that the hostages
were still alive and well.
Indian Home Minister Shankarrao Chavan earlier ruled out a prisoner
swop for the hostages.
''We are not going to release any criminals in our possession in
exchange for the hostages,'' he told Parliament.
Chavan told MPs during a debate on Kashmir that the government was
trying its best to ensure that no harm was done to the hostages -- two
Britons, an American, and a German -- and to seek their release.
''Efforts are being made through diplomatic channels and other
dialogues are being held,'' he said.
As the hostages began their eighth week in captivity, a spokesman for
the Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir denied reports that the
captives had been killed.
''We have definite reason to believe they are safe,'' he told
reporters in Srinagar, the state's summer capital.
The government's unidentified intermediary, who had been in regular
contact with the Al-Faran guerrilla captors, was in touch with them
again today, the spokesman said.
''In the absence of any adverse report, we believe the hostages are
safe,'' the spokesman said. Asked what would constitute an adverse
report, he said: ''Finding a dead body.''
Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, who like the other four Westerners
was kidnapped in early July, was found beheaded on August 13 in an
isolated Kashmiri forest.
Near his remains was a note in which Al-Faran threatened to execute
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, American Donald Hutchings, and
German Dirk Hasert unless India released 15 jailed militants within two
days.
Ostroe's killing after weeks of quiet negotiations dramatically raised
the stakes in the hostage crisis and prompted the government to consider
a rescue raid.
However the governor of Jammu and Kashmir said there were no plans for
a commando mission. He spoke after publicity about the arrival in
Kashmir of foreign experts, including hostage negotiators from Scotland
Yard.
Diplomats said those reports may have raised the captors' anxieties,
but their worries apparently subsided with the governor's statement and
renewed telephone contact.
''It was looking hopeful yesterday and that situation hasn't
changed,'' the state government spokesman said.
He added that there had been 1750 cases of kidnapping in Kashmir
between 1989 and the end of last month. He said the government had
released militants in only a handful of cases, and half the captives had
been killed.
Asked whether the government would rule out a swop of prisoners for
hostages, a senior official said: ''Why should I rule it out? All we are
interested in is having pressure from Pakistan build up on Al-Faran.''
India believes Al-Faran, unknown even to Kashmiri separatists before
the abductions, is linked to Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Ansar militants.
Harkat denies any association, and Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto has
condemned the abductions.--Reuter.

LABOUR said yesterday that the ''chicken run'' of Tory MPs quitting
their existing seats for safer ones at the next election was turning
into ''a stampede''.
More than 40 Tories have said they will not stand again and Labour
says others are seeking more secure bases.
Shadow Cabinet member Dr Marjorie Mowlam, the party's summer campaign
manager, said Social Security Secretary, ''lily-livered Peter Lilley'',
had failed to confirm whether he was going to move from St Albans to the
new seat of Hitchen.
She added a statement was also awaited from Tory party chairman Dr
Brian Mawhinney on whether he would move from Peterborough, where his
1992 majority was just more than 5000, to Cambridgeshire North-west.

A MOUNTAIN rescue team leader praised a troop of Scouts for ''being
prepared'' when their leader tumbled 150ft down a steep and rocky
Highland hillside.
Mr Seamus McNally of the Torridon Mountain Rescue Team co-ordinated
the rescue of 47-year-old Hastings Scout leader David Holt after he fell
on 3232ft Beinn Alligin in Wester Ross on Monday.
Mr Holt suffered head and back injuries in the fall, which was
witnessed by his two young sons, who were in the party of 11 on a
camping holiday.
They were scrambling up the steep hillside when Mr Holt lost his grip
on a loose rock and tumbled downhill.
Mr McNally said yesterday: ''The Scouts did all the right things, and
kept their heads. They obviously put their training to good use and gave
Mr Holt first aid until a doctor and two members of our team were flown
in to recover him.
''It was lucky for the young Scout team leader who went to raise the
alarm because a phone had been installed temporarily for the building of
a bridge in the area and the workmen let him use that.
''Mr Holt was also fortunate that he didn't suffer more serious
injuries, because he wasn't wearing a helmet. He is a big man and he
would have hit hard when he fell.
''He was also lucky that the helicopter happened to be on exercise in
the area at the time.''
Mr Holt is recovering in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.

<HEADLINE>Heart attack victims ignore warning signs, say doctors</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976748678</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN ALARMING number of
people are dying of heart attacks before reaching hospital because
they ignore the warning signs, a new study has found.
Of 2500 heart attacks recorded in the study, 48% -- 1200 -- proved
fatal. Doctors were surprised and alarmed to find that 75% of the deaths
occurred before the patient reached hospital.
In the under-55 age group, the trend was even more worrying. While
fewer people in this bracket had fatal heart attacks, 93% of those who
did were dead before reaching hospital.
Professor Robin Norris, who is co-ordinating the study, in York,
Cardiff and Brighton, said: ''In the 1960s two-thirds of heart attack
deaths occurred outside hospital, but we found three-quarters.
''These are worrying figures. We thought it wouldn't be anywhere near
as bad as this. We had hoped in these days of prompt treatment the trend
would be better.''
He thought the most likely reason why so many people were dying before
reaching hospital was that they failed to recognise or ignored the
warning signs of a heart attack.
The classic symptom is a dull, crushing pain, usually in the centre of
the chest but which can spread as far as the arms, neck, jaw and back.
Professor Norris, honorary cardiologist at the Royal Sussex County
Hospital, Brighton, said: ''If you have a pain typical of a heart attack
and it lasts as long as 15 minutes, the right thing to do is to call
999.''
The UK Heart Attack Study, sponsored by the Department of Health and
PPP Medical Trust, began 18 months ago, focusing on a total population
of one million people. It has another six months to run.
According to the latest figures from 1992, 300,000 people in the UK
have heart attacks each year, 95,457 of them fatal.
Professor Norris said ambulance services were responding to heart
attack call-outs efficiently.
Every ambulance called to a heart attack victim carried at least one
paramedic, and the new system of categorising emergency calls ensured
that people suffering heart attacks were given high priority.
Dr Ian Baird, medical spokesman at the British Heart Foundation, said:
''The reasons for the very large percentage of deaths before hospital
admission for younger people are not clear.
''One cause could be either failure to recognise the symptoms of a
heart attack or a denial of their severity.''
The study authors have launched a publicity campaign called Heart
Attack Action in an effort to improve people's understanding of heart
attacks.
Booklets have been printed and 50,000 distributed to GPs surgeries in
Brighton and elsewhere and a video has also been produced to increase
public awareness.
Dr Baird said: ''If the Heart Attack Action campaign were to reduce
the pre-hospital mortality, particularly in younger patients, it would
be a great advance in the management of heart attacks.''

<HEADLINE>Eight jailed for heroin Turkish connection</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976748682</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EIGHT men were sent to jail yesterday for their involvement in a drugs
ring which imported and distributed heroin from Turkey.
The drugs were distributed on Merseyside and amounts of cash, believed
to total about #2.5m, were handed over to the ''Turkish connection'' and
transported back to Turkey via Heathrow Airport, Liverpool Crown Court
was told.
A year's observations by Customs officers showed two Turkish
nationals, Yilmaz Kaya and Suleyman Ergun, frequently travelled to
Liverpool from London where they met the two main Merseyside dealers,
John Haase and Paul Bennett.
Huge amounts of cash proceeds in plastic bags were handed over, often
in a Liverpool pub, and this was taken back to Turkey and some of it
used to buy more drugs.
After Customs officers moved in to arrest the defendants, 87kg of
heroin were seized.
Judge David Lynch praised the investigating officers who smashed the
ring and described their operation as ''a major blow in the fight
against this despicable trade''.
He said the courts often dealt with the pitiful wretches who sell
heroin on the streets to feed their own addiction, but added: ''It is
rare that courts deal with somebody so high up the ladder as you are and
it must be marked by a heavy sentence.''
Three Liverpool men -- Haase, 46, of Sunlight Street, Anfield,
Bennett, 31, of Hazlehurst Road, Norris Green, and Edward Croker, 31, of
Tilston Road, Fazakerley -- had all admitted conspiracy to supply
heroin.
Haase and Bennett were described by the prosecution as the ''prime
movers'' in the Liverpool end of the operation and Croker was ''first
lieutenant''.
Haase and Bennett were both jailed for 18 years and had just over
#840,000 confiscated each. Croker was jailed for 14 years and had
#110,000 confiscated.
The five Turks involved in the illicit trade were 26-year-old Ergun,
Mehmet Ansen, Yilmaz Kaya, Bulent Onay, and Manuk Ocecki.
Kaya, 29, of no fixed address, described as the most heavily involved,
was jailed for 20 years and had #200,000 confiscated. His proceeds had
been estimated at #1m.
Kaya had pled guilty to conspiracy to import heroin. Ergun, of
Purchase Street, London, who was convicted of conspiracy to smuggle
heroin and conspiracy to supply, was jailed for 14 years.
Bulent Onay, 39, of Magrie Close, Enfield, Middlesex, who admitted two
offences of transferring drugs money out of the country and possessing
36kg of heroin with intent to supply, was sentenced to 14 years.
Mehmet Ansen, 54, of Instanbul, who pled guilty to three offences of
transferring money, was jailed for eight years and Manik Ocecki, of
Redington House, Priory London, was sentenced to four years after
admitting transferring drugs money.

FEWER people are travelling by bus and are paying fares which have
increased by an estimated 50% more than the rate of inflation for the
privilege, Labour claimed yesterday.
But the extent of damage caused by the bus industry's deregulation, in
1986, goes much deeper even than that, according to the party.
It alleged that private bus operators are not only providing a less
efficient service, but that many -- including Perth-based Stagecoach --
are engaged in predatory behaviour.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher, who launched the report
Stop That Bus, claimed: ''Every promise made by the Tories when buses
were deregulated has been broken.''
He argued that instead of greater competition leading to quality
services, lower fares, more passengers, new routes, and cuts in city
congestion, the reality since privatisation is:
* A 27% fall in passenger journeys, with 141,000 fewer each year, and
fares up by an estimated 50% more than inflation.
* Almost half the large buses in service are more than 12 years old,
compared with fewer than one in six before deregulation.
* Although bus use has declined, mileage is up -- buses are travelling
further but carrying fewer passengers, described as ''bad for the
public, bad for the environment, and bad for traffic congestion.''
The report found that just 20 of 53 municipal bus companies still
exist since deregulation, with 18 complaining of widespread predatory
competition from some of the biggest names in the business.
It said the predatory ''bus wars'' include deliberately scheduling
buses a few minutes before established services, and offering temporary
services free, or at a very low price, only on profit-making routes or
during peak hours.
Mr Meacher, who is to refer evidence to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission and demand tougher action against predators, said: ''The
industry is not more efficient, but is riddled with wasteful competition
and predatory behaviour.''
The report said that of 70 privatised national bus companies, just 15
retain a separate existence.
The 10-strong Scottish Bus Group, which included Northern Scottish,
Kelvin Central, and Western Scottish, was now in the hands of six owners
-- with Stagecoach and Aberdeen-based GRT (now merged with Badgerline to
form FirstBus) each owning three.
Since 1989, the market share of Stagecoach, Badgerline, GRT, and
British Bus had increased from 0.5% to 36%, according to the report,
with the independents' share now 14%.
Stagecoach -- recently condemned by the MMC for ''deplorable''
activities in Darlington, and blamed for the collapse of a municipal bus
company in the town -- has the biggest UK market share of private
operators, at 13%.
The firm has been hit by a salvo of unfavourable rulings in recent
months, prompting calls from both Labour and the SNP for re-regulation
of the bus industry.
Stagecoach's finance director, Mr Derek Scott, said yesterday that the
firm recognised the industry's average statistics between 1986-94,
quoted by Mr Meacher, but was disappointed that ''positive news'' about
the company had apparently not been noticed.
The number of Stagecoach passengers was up 4% over the year; fares had
increased by, on average, less than 2% -- below the rate of inflation --
and the average age of its fleet was 9.1 years.
Mr Scott made no reference to predatory activity, but spoke of
multi-million pound investments in new vehicles.

THE Celtic and former Scottish international footballer Mike Galloway
was battling for life in a Leicester hospital last night after being
hurt in a head-on car crash.
The player's parents and his girlfriend, Ms Linda Frazer, who is the
mother of his four-month-old daughter, Sophie, were at his bedside in
the intensive care ward after he underwent extensive emergency surgery
to treat head, internal, and leg injuries. His condition was said to be
critical.
Mr Galloway, 30, is believed to have been travelling to his home in
the village of Leire from Leicester when his Fiat Tipo was involved in
the accident with a Vauxhall Cavalier on the A426 at Dunton Bassett
shortly before midnight.
Police sealed off the stretch of quiet country road for several hours
while firefighters worked for more than 50 minutes to cut Mr Galloway
free.
He was treated by doctors from Leicester Royal Infirmary ''Flying
Squad'' before being taken to the hospital by ambulance where he was
operated upon through Monday night and most of yesterday morning.
Mr Galloway's legs were trapped in the wreckage of the car, raising
fears that he would never play again.
In a club statement last night, Celtic manager Tommy Burns said:
''Everyone at the club is deeply shocked at the news of Michael's
accident and our thoughts are with his immediate family.''
Celtic midfielder Peter Grant said most of his fellow players had
learned of the accident from morning radio reports and that training had
been ''subdued''.
He added: ''It put everything into perspective. Everyone is thinking
of Michael now, not just the players but the staff who work around the
ground.
''He is a well liked lad and this came at a time when things were
picking up again for him in terms of his career.''
Mr Galloway has a six-year-old daughter by his estranged wife, Denise,
who lives in Mid Calder, West Lothian. She said the family were in
shock.
The player, currently on loan to Portsmouth, had just completed a loan
period with Leicester City and had been training with the club until
recently.
Leicester manager Mark McGhee, who played briefly with Galloway at
Celtic, said the whole club was ''very distressed'' by the accident.
He added: ''Although he had been here for only a few months, he had
become a very popular part of the club, both with the fans and playing
staff. We still consider him to be one of the lads.
''Training was very subdued and we're just praying to God he will be
OK. I found Mike a very committed and positive man and hope these
qualities will see him through at this time.''
His former Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh described Galloway as a
''dedicated professional'' and said he hoped the player's considerable
personal resources would save him.
''Mike is such a determined player and was mentally strong and I would
like to think this could help pull him through.''
His current loan club, Portsmouth, which is negotiating with Celtic
over a possible #250,000 permanent transfer, said it was ''devastated''
and that its thoughts were with Galloway's family.
Galloway, who was born in England, joined Hearts from Halifax Town in
1987. Known for his robust and enthusiastic performances, he was a
favourite at Tynecastle before joining Celtic for #500,000 in 1989.
A versatile player, he fulfilled several roles in the Parkhead team
and crowned his career with a cap for Scotland in the European
Championship qualifier against Romania in 1992.
The driver of the Cavalier, Mr Simon Rogers, 22, was kept in Leicester
Royal Infirmary overnight and released yesterday morning after being
treated for lacerations to his head and legs.

POLICE are treating as suspicious a blaze at the Mountain Lines shop
in Kirkcaldy High Street, yesterday, which forced several families to
flee their homes.
It is thought the shop, which specialises in outdoor wear and climbing
gear, may have been broken into shortly before the blaze, which resulted
in one woman suffering a slight injury.

Johannesburg,
TWO South African women whose babies were accidentally switched at
birth six years ago are suing authorities for thousands of pounds in
damages, but want to keep their non-biological sons.
Margaret Clinton-Parker and Sandra Dawkins have begun legal action in
the Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg demanding damages of more than
#20,000 each from provincial authorities.
The women claim staff at Nigel hospital, Johannesburg, were negligent
in causing the babies to be swopped in February 1989.
Both told the court they had decided to keep the boys they had raised
after consultations with psychiatrists. They said they had formed deep
bonds with their non-biological sons.
Psychiatrist David Shevel told the court the women had suffered
anxiety and depression.
''This situation, whatever solution is eventually decided on, will
have lifelong repercussions on both women and their sons,'' he said.
The case is continuing.--Reuter.

THE campaign to save the Fort William sleeper service is by no means
over, Scottish Liberal Democrat MP, Mr Charles Kennedy, claimed
yesterday.
He said sources within British Rail had indicated a political
compromise which fell far short of most people's expectations.
''I had assumed that the battle was all but won, but extremely
well-placed sources advise me that this may be some way from the fact of
the matter,'' he said.
''Apparently, figures are still being drawn up in a way which portrays
the service in the least favourable light.
''The big nagging doubt has to be that a politically face-saving
formula is found which maintains the Fort William service on paper but
which places it at a huge disadvantage in practice.''
Mr Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, said it was essential the
sleeper was properly marketed, with convenient arrival and departure
times and adequate catering and other facilities.
He said the key question was whether there would be two or three
sleeper services from Inverness, Aberdeen, and Fort William.
''That is why the message must be reinforced beyond doubt. This
campaign has been about saving a free-standing Fort William sleeper,''
he said.
Mr Kennedy, speaking at St Andrew's House in Edinburgh where he handed
in a petition with 5000 signatures in support of the campaign, said it
was essential to keep up the pressure on Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth and Mr Roger Salmon, the director of the Office of Passenger
Rail Franchising.

A PRANK played on a team-mate backfired and cost Newtonmore shinty
star Colin Stewart his driving licence yesterday.
Inverness Sheriff Court heard how 22-year-old Stewart, of Corunlia,
Newtonmore, was among a group of players in a car returning from a match
against Glenurquhart on March 18.
When driver Mr Evan Cheyne, 22, of Tigh-nan-Alt, Glen Road,
Newtonmore, stopped the car to relieve himself, Stewart, who had been
drinking, jumped into the front seat and drove off.
The car was subsequently stopped by police, one of whom decided to
take its occupants to headquarters for questioning. But en route he was
diverted to a fight near Findlay's pub in Tomnahurich Street, Inverness,
and stopped to attend the incident.
When the officer failed to return, Stewart and his team-mates popped
into Findlay's for a drink, an action that could have resulted in the
dismissal of Stewart's drink-driving charge.
However, when his breath/alcohol count was reduced to take into
account one large whisky, he was still 6mg over the limit of 35mg. He
was fined #350 and banned from driving for a year.
Depute fiscal Vicky Roger told the court: ''It was post-incident
drinking before he was actually breathalysed which caused the
discrepancy. Mr Stewart was originally being treated as a witness, but
it later emerged that he had been driving.''
Defence agent Craig Wood said: ''He decided to play a prank, but
police arrived at a most inopportune moment.''
Confusion over who had been driving the car was caused when the
players quickly swopped seats as the police approached after the prank.
Mr Cheyne's plea of not guilty to a charge of being drunk in charge of
a car was accepted by the court.
A Northern Constabulary spokesman said he was not aware of the
incident.

ONE of the most eagerly awaited events of the motoring year will occur
in September, when customer deliveries of the new MGF begin. This latest
expression of the MG theme, which has provided enthusiasts with
affordable sports cars for more than 70 years, is not some nostalgic
''retro'' design, but a completely up-to-date mid-engined two-seater. It
has attracted intense international interest since it was first
displayed in March at the Geneva Motor Show.
Although MG gave many people their first experience of sports car
motoring, there have been no MG-badged two-seaters in the showrooms for
several years, except for the limited-production RV8, a throwback in
appearance to the MGB of the 1970s. One reason for marketing the RV8, it
now seems clear, was to create a ''head of steam'' in Japan and build up
enthusiasm for the MG marque there.
Rover has already received more than 1250 orders for the new sports
car, even before any outsider has driven it. Enthusiasts here are
obviously very keen to see a modern MG on the road, and the level of
interest in Japan is almost overwhelming. The Japanese importer is
reported to have been making hopeful noises about annual supply figures
greater than the production capacity of the factory. One thing is
certain -- this will be a car with a waiting list.
Although there are some nostalgic touches like the retention, in
modified form, of the historic octagon badge, the MGF is definitely a
design of the mid-1990s. It uses Rover's highly regarded K-series
engine, with a 1.8-litre capacity which was previously considered beyond
its possible ''stretch''.
The standard car, available in September at #15,995, uses this unit in
120bhp form, but the VVC version, which will come on stream two months
later with a price tag of #17,995, has a brand-new variable valve
control system which boosts the power to 145bhp. Maximum effective revs
rise from 5500 to 7000rpm. The likely performance of the two versions
includes figures like 0-60mph in 8.5 seconds and a 120mph test-track top
speed for the lower-priced model, compared with seven seconds and 130mph
for the VVC.
The fore-and-aft linked suspension uses the latest application of the
Hydragas system, while all-round disc brakes with ABS are standard on
the VVC but optional on the other model. The same thing applies to the
brand-new speed-sensitive power steering, which is an electric system
unlike anything offered by the MG's rivals.
While the ivory-coloured instrument dials, octagon badge on the
fascia, and such details as a drilled throttle pedal in vintage sports
car style are meant to be nostalgic touches, the MGF cockpit is much
more luxuriously trimmed and equipped than older generations of MG
owners will remember. Especially here, sports car owners are not likely
to want hood-down motoring all year round, and MG seems to have struck a
chord by offering a detachable hardtop as an optional extra. Two out of
five of the people who have placed orders so far have specified it.
A luggage rack, ski and cycle carriers, a leather-trimmed gear lever
knob, a CD autochanger and several other items of additional equipment
are already on the options list. And even before deliveries of the car
itself begin, there is an MG collection of watches, pens, sweaters,
jackets, umbrellas, key fobs, wallets and car rugs in the catalogue.
Much of the design element in the MGF is obviously hi-tech, and the
same thing can be said about how customers will be able to specify and
order their cars. At each dealership, already linked to Rover's
computerised Discus system, it will be possible to sit in front of a
screen and, to a certain extent, design your own car. You fancy an MGF
in Flame Red? A few stabs at the keyboard will produce one on the
screen. With black upholstery? Same thing. Or perhaps with British
Racing Green bodywork, hardtop, luggage rack? Later on, as the computer
system develops further, it will be possible, once you have settled on
exactly the specification you want, to see it being sent down the line
to the factory. That will be the build order for your own particular
car, direct from the showroom.
Every dealership will have ''dedicated'' MG technicians and
specialised MGF sales personnel. Each customer will be put in contact
with named members of staff, and will deal with them exclusively. The
idea is to build up personal relationships so that not only in driving
it, but also in anything to do with sales, service or repair work, the
MGF owner should experience the individuality the company hopes will be
the car's hallmark.

MANY children are dying in house fires in Scotland because of parental
neglect often due to the effects of alcohol, a university study has
found.
The University of Edinburgh report, based on procurator-fiscals'
records of 168 child fatalities, states: ''Although these fires were
generally perceived as being tragic 'accidents', we conclude they were
largely a direct result of the activities of adults in the home. The
role of alcohol in domestic fires is particularly important.
''House fire fatalities are frequently a direct result of adult
behaviour and, particularly in the case of child fatalities, can be
attributed to negligent behaviour.
''Children are being killed in house fires because their parents and
care givers are neglecting their duty to ensure the child's
well-being.''
The report highlighted the case of the mother of a young child who had
moved a fire guard to protect an audio system. In another case a mother
was prosecuted for leaving her child, who died in the fire, alone in the
house for several hours.
Co-author Professor Anthony Busuttil, professor of forensic medicine
at the university, said: ''It would be invidious to say neglect is to
blame in every single case but it is one of the more important factors.
''Scotland has a very high incidence of household fires and children
are vulnerable. People in charge have to take their well-being into
account as well.''
Professor Busuttil, who is also a police surgeon, said there was
little concrete evidence because there were so few criminal prosecutions
for neglect following a fatal fire. The authorities often took the view
that parents had suffered enough, he said.
Most fatal fires involving children are caused by their playing with
matches, lighters, coal, or electric fires. Professor Busuttil said
deaths could be prevented by proper supervision and safety precautions,
such as keeping smoking materials out of reach.
The professor said fire fatalities could also be reduced by the
widespread installation of smoke alarms and improved education. He added
that front line professionals, such as social workers and health staff,
should be encouraged to take a more proactive stance by tackling the
problem during home visits to families.
He also pointed out that there was no system to measure blood-alcohol
levels as there is after road accidents.
Assistant divisional officer Maurice Gibb, of Lothian and Borders Fire
Brigade, said alcohol played a ''significant part'' in house fire
fatalities.
''These findings concur with my experience as an operational
firefighter,'' he said. ''This year has not been too bad with only one
fatal fire involving someone under 16 in our area. Since 1988, 128
people have lost their lives in fires, 13 of those were under the age of
16. I would suggest alcohol has played a significant part in their
deaths.''
Mr Gibb said the brigade was involved in a school education programme
to improve fire safety awareness among youngsters.
Strathclyde's senior divisional fire safety officer Hugh Adie said:
''There is no dubiety about the part drugs and alcohol play in fatal
fires. It must be addressed through the education process.''
The study is entitled Child Fatalities in Scottish House Fires
1980-1990: A Case of Child Neglect?, and has been published in the
United States.

THE bravery of a policeman who used his handcuffs to stop a suicidal
man from throwing himself off Jane's Brae road bridge, Cumbernauld, was
recognised yesterday.
Just as the desperate man was about to leap from the bridge, Sergeant
David Bird handcuffed him, stopping the man from falling to his death.
The man almost pulled Mr Bird off the bridge, but the policeman
managed to hold on to him until help arrived.
Yesterday, Mr Bird, 40, and two other Strathclyde police officers were
honoured with bravery awards by Councillor James Jennings, chairman of
the region's Police and Fire Committee at a ceremony in Glasgow. Long
service and good conduct medals were also presented to 25 officers.
Mr Bird said: ''It is nice to receive awards, but I am happy to know
that the guy's two children still have a dad.
''When I arrived at the bridge it was clear he was going to jump, so I
decided to handcuff myself to him -- which with hindsight wasn't a very
good idea.
''I thought he was going to take me with him at one point, but I held
on to the railing with him suspended below me kicking and struggling
trying to release himself.''
The courageous officer, who pulled several muscles in the rescue last
October, said he had no time to be scared during the five minutes he
waited for his colleagues to arrive.
Constable Michael Cleary, 32, who was off-duty when he tackled armed
raiders after they held up a security van, also received a bravery
award.
Mr Cleary was driving along Paisley Road West, Glasgow, last January
with his wife, Anne, and their two-year-old son Graeme, when he saw two
men on a motorbike escaping with #24,109 from a security van.
One of the raiders tried to fire at Mr Cleary with a pump-action
shotgun.
''Luckily the gun jammed and I struggled with them on the ground
before they ran off,'' said Mr Cleary. ''I chased after them and managed
to hold one of them until the cavalry arrived.''
He added: ''It was so quick I had no time to think about it. My wife
was looking on in horror, shouting and bellowing at me for having done
it. It was an unreal experience.''
The man who escaped was later identified by the officer at an
identification parade. The men received prison terms of 12 and 15 years.
The third officer to receive his award was Sergeant David Craig, 29,
who disarmed a youth armed with a knife after he had assaulted his
mother at her home in Cranhill, Glasgow.

Luxembourg, Tuesday,
NEARLY one in seven of Luxembourg's population is due to turn out for
what is being billed as the cultural event of the year, the country's
first concert by the Rolling Stones.
However Sunday's gathering of more than 55,000 Luxemburgers at the
Kirschberg concert site, more usually home to Luxembourg's Parliament,
the European Court of Justice, and meetings of European Union ministers,
is causing a transport nightmare.
To help the capital cope, free park-and-ride bus services have been
set up on the edge of the city and the national railway is laying on
additional cars, raising the capacity of each train to 6000 passengers.
Francois Pauly of the bank which is selling 56,000 tickets at about
#40 each said 99% of the tickets had gone to Luxembourg
residents.--Reuter.

A FORKLIFT truck driver's life has been a nightmare since the vehicle
ran over and killed two elderly women, Falkirk Sheriff Court was told
yesterday.
Ernest Ryan, 47, was grief-stricken and had not been able to sleep
properly since the accident in Falkirk last year.
However, Sheriff Albert Sheehan told him to think about the families
of the two women who died. ''They will still be suffering their grief
and anguish.''
Ryan, of Alligan Road, Crieff, admitted careless driving on September
5, 1994, when he reversed from a building site and ran over Helen
Walker, 77, and Dorothy Moodie, 79.
He was fined #1000 and had nine penalty points put on his licence.
Ryan's firm confirmed after the case that he would continue to drive a
forklift truck for them, but road safety campaigners condemned the
sentence, saying the law was wrong to allow him back on the road.
Mrs Moodie died at the scene of the accident at the junction of Breton
Court and Finestre Avenue. Her friend, Mrs Walker, died later that night
in Falkirk Royal Infirmary.
Depute procurator-fiscal Sarah Livinsgtone told the court that Ryan
had been asked to reverse his forklift truck out of the building site so
that a tyre fitter could fix a puncture on the vehicle.
The tyre fitter beckoned the old ladies to cross the road. The truck,
which had a loud reversing bleeper, reversed.
Ms Livingstone added: ''But the forklift truck had very poor
visibility to the rear and there was no-one guiding Mr Ryan out to the
road.''
She said: ''As he reversed, Mr Ryan drove over the two ladies. The
tyre fitter ran and banged on the forklift truck.''
During the hearing, Ryan's wife sobbed in the public benches as she
listened to the evidence. The couple have three children.
Counsel Mr Sam Cathcart said that after the accident Ryan was taken to
hospital, suffering from shock. He was off work for four weeks and
prescribed sleeping pills and tranquillisers by his doctor.
He said: ''He still loses sleep today.''
He said: ''This is not a case of a driver reversing and doing nothing
to ensure he did it safely.''
Sheriff Sheehan said he wanted to explain the sentence to the families
of the two women who died.
He said: ''I take it this vehicle was insured. Any question of damage
and compensation can be considered by the civil courts.''
The sheriff noted that Ryan had been charged with careless driving --
and not with causing the death of the women, even though the accident
may have resulted in their deaths.
He said that he accepted that Ryan was ''grief stricken'' because of
the accident.
He added: ''But there must also have been a great deal of grief and
shock in the families. They will still be suffering grief and anguish.''
The sheriff said Ryan knew the vehicle had a ''blind spot'' when
reversing and had asked for help when coming out of the building site on
to the road.
However, when he did not get help, he continued to reverse out,
knowing he couldn't see fully behind him.
Sheriff Sheehan noted that there was ''no great speed'' in Ryan's
reversing manoeuvre.
After the hearing, Ryan left the court with his wife and said: ''I'm
saying nothing.''
Mrs Walker's son, Brian, said: ''The matter is now closed.''
Ms Isobel Brydie, chairman of the Scottish Campaign Against
Irresponsible Drivers, said it was wrong to allow Ryan to drive again.
She said the problem lay with the legislation.
''It's the law that's wrong because the sheriff has to pass sentence
based on the degree of carelessness involved in the accident.
''He has to blank out of his mind the consequences of the accident --
in this case the death of two old ladies.''
Ms Brydie added that the group had been campaigning to get the law
changed, so that sheriffs could take the consequences of accidents into
account.
Ryan's building firm, Ogilvy Homes, confirmed that the driver would
continue to work for them.
Managing director Ronald Cheape said: ''Mr Ryan has been with us ever
since he came back to work after the accident, and he will continue to
work for us as a forklift truck driver.''

<HEADLINE>Telephone sales boost for the unemployed. Calling 350 jobs on line</HEADLINE>

TWO large insurance companies, National Australia Life and General
Accident, are creating 350 jobs in the Glasgow area in telephone sales.
Many of the jobs will go to people who have been unemployed for more
than six months, who will receive special training.
National Australia Life, an offshoot of the National Australia Group
which owns Clydesdale Bank, is setting up a call centre in Clydebank
Business Park to sell life assurance by phone. The operation is due to
start in October. It will employ 90 existing group employees and recruit
160 new staff.
Perth-based General Accident is meanwhile recruiting 100 staff for its
existing telephone sales centre in Bishopbriggs.
Dunbartonshire Enterprise is funding a series of six-week customised
training courses to help the long-term unemployed get jobs with both
companies. These courses help job seekers speak clearly and work
effectively over the telephone and are tailor-made to the requirements
of National Australia and General Accident.
Twelve of the 18 people who have gone through the General Accident
course so far have been offered jobs at the Bishopbriggs call centre.
General Accident employs 450 people selling insurance, handling claims
and dealing with customer inquiries by phone at Bishopbriggs and 133
more at a second call centre in Hamilton.
No special academic qualifications are required to get a place on
Dunbartonshire Enterprise's customised training programmes. ''You don't
have to have a large number of Highers for these jobs. You just have to
have the personality and the adaptability,'' said Mr Nick Cowie, of
Dunbartonshire Enterprise.
The LEC, part of Scottish Enterprise, has organised similar courses
for several other companies moving into the Glasgow area. These have
enabled inward investors to recruit good local staff rapidly and
cheaply. At the same time, they have chipped away at local unemployment,
running at 10% to 11%.
General Accident aims to recruit 40 people immediately to cope with a
steady expansion of telephone sales at its Bishopbriggs centre and a
further 60 over the next 12 months.
Recruits must put up with evening and weekend working and should not
expect to become millionaires overnight. Starting salaries range from
#6600 to #8000 for a person with O-grades and a couple of years'
relevant experience.
Call centres that sell financial products, take reservations or give
expert advice by phone are taking root and expanding rapidly in
Scotland, creating more than 5000 new jobs.
Most of the jobs are based in the Glasgow area and many are expanding
as business moves from front office counters to the phone.
The cable television firm, BSkyB, employs 1200 at one of Europe's
biggest call centres in Livingston.
Another newcomer is Abbey National, which established a centre in
Glasgow to sell life assurance by phone earlier this year. This employs
50 people, but the building society-turned-bank aims to boost its
workforce to 300 within three years.
Critics say call centres mainly offer low-paid unskilled jobs, many of
which are only part-time. But proponents maintain they provide stable
employment in a growing area of the service sector and are helping
replace jobs lost in manufacturing.

SCOTLAND Yard detectives who have flown to New Zealand to interview a
man about the murder of Rachel Nickell have so far failed to meet him.
The officers yesterday spoke to a barrister acting for the 31-year-old
man and a solicitor representing his 25-year-old girlfriend.
The man, a former London barman, was reported to have denied any
involvement in the case.
He acknowledged he was in the Wimbledon Common area on the day in July
1992 when the 23-year-old former model was stabbed to death in front of
two-year-old son Alex, but insisted he had an alibi and claimed
witnesses had misidentified him.
He is reported to have said he remembered the day of the killing
because he was going for a game of golf and was held up by police road
blocks.
The man used to live on the Roehampton Estate, near Wimbledon Common,
south west London.
Mr Colin Stagg, who also lives on the Roehampton Estate, was cleared
of Ms Nickell's murder.
Detective Chief Inspector Allan Jude, who is heading the
three-year-old murder inquiry, and Detective Constable Russ Norval, flew
to Hastings on New Zealand's North Island earlier this week after a new
witness emerged.
The witness reported spotting a man with a blood-soaked shirt on the
day of Ms Nickell's death.
The man police wish to question says he moved to New Zealand in
February 1993. He shares a bungalow with his New Zealand girlfriend,
whom he met in London.
Their home stands in the grounds of a 27-acre fruit farm, owned by the
woman's parents.

<HEADLINE>Council bids to keep oil flowing to Sullom Voe</HEADLINE>

SHETLAND Islands Council met oil company representatives in Aberdeen
yesterday in a bid to safeguard Sullom Voe's future as the destination
for oil which flows through the Brent and Ninian pipelines.
The meeting was one of a number between the parties and a spokesman
for the oil operators said it was simply technical.
The council is challenging some assumptions made by the operators in
their calculations on which they plan to base decisions to continue to
use Sullom Voe or to commence offshore loading on tankers when existing
contracts expire.
The spokesman said the council's oil development officer, Mr Alistair
Cooper, had put forward points and these would be considered.
Earlier this year, oil operators warned if costs at Sullom Voe were
not cut, it might not be viable to renew contracts when they expire in
the year 2000.
In April, Shell and Esso announced they had awarded contracts worth
#500,000 to confirm the feasibility of offshore loading systems to serve
Brent and other fields.
Chevron, which operates the Ninian Field and uses the second pipeline
running into the terminal, is also known to be examining comparative
costs of offshore loading and using the pipeline.
The terminal, which employs almost 400, received a further blow two
weeks later when BP announced the first oil from the West of Shetland
would go by tanker from the Foinaven Field to Flotta in Orkney. BP
actually operates Sullom Voe on behalf of 34 companies.
Since then, the council has apparently offered to halve the current
#7m rent but only last week BP's new general manager, Mr Greg Bourne,
said more cost-cutting concessions would have to be made to guarantee
the terminal's future. The council's offer had been ''a huge
breakthrough'' but was not enough.
He said: ''The cuts they have offered are an indication they know the
direction in which they have to move. They are beginning to clearly
understand the competitive threat which they face.
''It is now a matter of the people in Shetland seeing what the
different opportunities and threats are.''
He said discussions were at a delicate stage but there was room for
negotiation.

Geneva
THE UN refugee agency condemned Zaire today for the forced expulsion
of thousands of Rwandan and Burundian refugees and said it hoped Zaire
would ''honour its commitments as a country of asylum''.
The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said Zairean soldiers had expelled 9500 Rwandan refugees and
close to 2000 Burundians from camps along Zaire's eastern borders.
It added that more than 60,000 others had fled to the hills around
Uvira to escape soldiers abusing the refugees in the camps.
''We must condemn the violence being directed against these
refugees,'' said Carrol Faubert, the UNHCR's special envoy to the Great
Lakes region.
''These forced expulsions must stop immediately. UNHCR hopes that
Zaire will remain loyal to its generous humanitarian tradition and
continue, as in the past, to honour its commitments as a country of
asylum,'' Faubert added.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked Sadako Ogata, the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees, to make an urgent trip to Zaire to try
to stop the expulsions and calm the crisis.
Zaire hosts more than a million of the 1.8 million Rwandans who fled
the country after last year's genocide. It is also home to 72,000 of the
180,000 Burundian refugees.
The UNHCR said soldiers rounded up men, women, and children in Mugunga
camp, near Goma, yesterday and set many huts and shops ablaze.
''Widespread looting by unruly soldiers, refugees, and neighbouring
Zaireans was reported in Mugunga,'' it said.
In Uvira, to the south, the UNHCR said Zaireans had descended on
abandoned camps at Kagunga, Runingo, and Luvarisi and put huts to the
torch after stripping them of roofing materials.
Ironically, the UNHCR has a force of 1500 Zairean soldiers which it
pays to maintain security in the camps and which is still working for
the agency.
A UNHCR spokesman said that force was not protecting the refugees but
was instead trying to protect warehouses, medical clinics, and aid
agency offices.
Zaire, which has long complained about the burden of hosting so many
refugees, gave the brush-off to a letter from High Commissioner Sadako
Ogata complaining about the expulsions. UNHCR officials said Ogata was
sending another protest.
''We realise it's had disastrous environmental effects, economic
effects, even security problems,'' said spokesman Ron Redmond.
''So we understand their concerns, but this is no way to go about
trying to resolve this problem because it's simply going to contribute
to further destabilisation in the region.''
The camps are paid for through UNHCR appeals to donor nations. In the
entire Great Lakes region, UNHCR funding for refugee camps will amount
to #175m.
Belgium, the former colonial power in the region, criticised Zaire's
forced repatriation of thousands of refugees, meanwhile, and called on
the central African state to observe existing agreements on the refugee
problem.
''The Zairean decision to expel Rwandan refugees is causing violence,
looting and destruction of the (refugee) camps by Zairean soldiers,''
said Foreign Minister Erik Derycke.
He added that the expulsions were also causing the refugees to panic
and flee into the mountains where, without food and facilities, they
were looking for shelter.
''This situation is raising the tension in the region considerably,''
Derycke said.
The Belgian minister said Zaire should observe its part in the Nairobi
and Bujumbura accords which called on the region as a whole to deal with
the refugee problem.
Derycke called on the international community to continue its efforts
to alleviate ''the precarious situation'' of both the Zairean people and
the refugees.--Reuter.

FEMINIST pop stars Sinead O'Connor and Chrissie Hynde were in
aggressive mood yesterday in publicising a concert as part of a women's
rights campaign.
They will perform this Saturday as part of a massive two-day campaign
called What Women Want on London's South Bank, with the main show at the
Royal Festival Hall.
But the stars were prickly at a press conference, with Hynde telling
male journalists: ''You're invited to the castration stand.''
O'Connor argued with one female journalist from a music paper and
called a tabloid reporter ''the lowest of the low''. Then the singer,
who is three months pregnant, said: ''We are going to be looking at the
worship of God as a woman.''
The concert, to be broadcast by Viva! 963AM, will be hosted by
comedienne Jo Brand.
The campaign has the backing of MEP Glenys Kinnock, who said: ''These
are huge issues. The point of the weekend is that women refuse to be
invisible.''

on the Rwanda-Zaire border
PANIC-STRICKEN Rwandan refugees ran for cover today into eastern
Zaire's gorilla parks, forests, and lush hills to escape Zairean troops.
''Entire families are just taking off, running into the woods and
national parks,'' said an exhausted UN field official.
''It's a real mess. There are people all over the place,'' he added,
gesturing to hills overlooking the blue waters of Lake Kivu, a popular
honeymoon spot for foreign tourists since colonial times until the
Rwandan refugees swept in last year.
UN officials said it was impossible to know the number of people who
had plunged into mountain forests and nearby hills.
''It's bad enough to assist refugees in Zaire. Now we have thousands
of displaced people in Rwanda,'' said one official.
On the third day of deportations, more than 85,000 people took to
mountains and villages near Mugunga camp and towns of Uvira and Bukavu
to the south to escape troops snatching people at gunpoint.
A shrivelled man of about 90 dragged across the 500yd-wide no-man's
land a huge sack, which burst on the way. A single shoe, pieces of dirty
rags, and several pots littered the ground.
Many people drifted off into the hills and tried to melt away into
Zairean villages, where they are bound to be unwelcome guests.
At the north-western border crossing, many mothers had lost their
children.
''This is a major humanitarian crisis. We're talking about large
numbers,'' said UNHCR envoy Carrol Faubert. ''Families are separated,
kids attending school are forgotten in the camps, and the parents and
the rest of the families sent across.''''--Reuter.

THE Scottish Constitutional Convention has scheduled an extra
negotiating session in advance of the fanfare launch of its final plans
on St Andrew's Day.
However, its leaders insisted yesterday they were well on course for
full agreement by November 30 and claimed there were no serious
divisions over issues surrounding plans for a Scottish Parliament.
Canon Kenyon Wright, confirming there would be an extra session,
added: ''This is not caused by any disagreement but is to prove
everything absolutely watertight.''
Claims that Labour had retreated from strong principles on guaranteed
funding for the Parliament -- to the extent that former Shadow Scottish
Secretary Donald Dewar had been brought in to heal the wounds -- were
rejected.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said he was a political
ally and close friend of Mr Dewar for 20 years and it would have been
strange had he not consulted a leading figure who was an architect of
Labour's devolution plans from the 70s.
However, he insisted there was no significance in these discussions
and no pressure from London to change the party's devolution stance.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth leapt in gleefully last night,
saying dithering within the Convention proved the closer Labour and
Scottish Liberal Democrats came to a scheme, the more their differences
emerged.
He said: ''Where's the Bill? They keep telling us they have worked out
the details but when it comes down to it they can't tell us the
detail.''
Earlier, Canon Wright said: ''I am consistently surprised to read how
disunited we are and then to come together and find we are very much
capable of reaching consensus.''
He added that there was an issue on sovereignty between Scotland and
Westminster but said it was absurd to assume that there could be a
repeal of a Scottish Parliament any more than the India Act or Canada
Act could have been repealed.
He said the Scottish Parliament would be entrenched in ''moral,
political, and social'' terms and the language of how it was funded was
not so important as the fact.
Mr Robertson said the meeting had shown goodwill, getting beyond
mundane opposition through the ingenuity and strength of arguments.
Convener of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mrs Marilyne MacLaren,
confirmed their negotiators were happy with how things had gone. She
insisted there was no doubt on their part on how the Scottish Parliament
would be funded and added they felt very happy about the agreement on
entrenching powers of the proposed Parliament.
Mr Robertson claimed that the new system did not resemble the current
block grant awarded to the Scottish Office. He insisted the phrase ''an
assigned budget'' was sufficient to guarantee independent decision
making by any Scottish Parliament provided the formula for such revenue
was built into the legislation.
The Liberal Democrats appear to have accepted this and party leader,
Mr Jim Wallace, said that making the detail fully defensible against
political opponents was an important factor.
Last night, Mr Forsyth said: ''The idea that Westminster would vote a
generous grant to Scotland that allows reductions in income tax is a
triumph of hope over experience and puts at risk vital services on which
every Scot depends.''

yesterday.
The castle and grounds, which has been the home to the Frasers of
Lovat for more than 500 years is already up for sale at #6m.
Family members hope the sale by Christie's, which runs from October
16-18, will raise #1.5m.
Historic books, furniture, silver, porcelain, and sporting equipment
will be included in the lots. The sale will take place inside the
castle.
Among the items are a William Morris carpet, and Jacobite memorabilia,
which include a pair of Scottish flintlock pistols used at the Battle of
Culloden in 1796.
One of the lots consists of three locks of hair reputedly belonging to
Prince James Francis Edward, the only legitimate son of James VII and

WHILE other makes of sports car have a similarly lengthy pedigree,
MG's sporting heritage includes not just the grand international
occasions, but also local events in which private owners could use the
cars they otherwise drove to work. It is partly this which makes many
now sedate saloon car owners recall their early MG days with affection.
From their first appearance in the mid-1920s, MGs competed in motor
club events all over Scotland. Pre-war reports mention them taking
innumerable awards in rallies, mud-plug trials, and speed hill climbs at
places such as Bo'ness.
After the war, MGs were winning prizes in trials and rallies, at the
Rest and be Thankful hill climbs, and in circuit races at Winfield,
Crimond, Turnberry and Charterhall. Scottish MG drivers like Ron
Flockhart and Archie Scott-Brown progressed to the international racing
scene.
John Milne, Bill Shepherd and John Williamson were stalwarts of the MG
rally team in the Alpine and the Liege-Rome-Liege. A string of MG owners
won the Scottish rally championship -- Ninian Paterson in a TD, Sandy
Morrison in a TF, Logan Morrison in an MGA.
Even after volume production of MG two-seaters petered out, David
Gillanders and Alistair Brearley were rallying in the Scottish forests
with MG Metro 6R4s, although purists hardly regarded these as ''real''
MGs.
However, some enthusiasts turned to the classic MGs of the past. Three
Scottish MG clubs organise events, preserve and rebuild cars sometimes
found in almost derelict condition, and are great ones for the
traditional ''noggin and natter''.
One member of the Triple M Register, which caters for Midgets, Magnas
and Magnettes, has compiled a register of all these models built between
1929 and 1936, now or previously in Scottish ownership. It runs to well
over 300 individual car histories.
These may be enthusiasts for MGs generations old. But, like other past
and present owners, they are keen to see the MGF where all MGs ought to
be -- hood down, pressing on, out on the open road.

A CHURCH of Ireland clergyman who branded Roman Catholic Cardinal
Cahal Daly as ''the Red Hatted Weasel in Armagh'' was given a public
dressing down by his archbishop last night but stood by his words.
The Rev William Hoey made the comment in his south Belfast parish
newsletter.
Church of Ireland Primate, Archbishop Robin Eames, was clearly
outraged at the attack on the Cardinal with whom he has worked closely
to foster peace and inter-church harmony.
He said: ''I find the words that were used were extremely regrettable.
I certainly feel that it was unfortunate that those words were used --
everyone is entitled to their views -- but I certainly can say
categorically that this is not the view of the Church of Ireland.''

THE pipe-and-slippers lifestyle of the middle-aged couple is becoming
a thing of the past, a survey out today reports.
Gone are the days when couples could be certain of putting their feet
up during their 50s and early 60s, according to research by market
analyst Mintel. Now, more and more couples aged between 45 and 64 either
still have children at home or are responsible for elderly parents.
Middle-aged men are becoming increasingly disillusioned by work and
many live in fear of losing their job.
Many middle-aged women, who are more likely to be working, are leading
frenetic lifestyles normally associated with younger working mothers and
their health may be suffering as a result, said Mintel.
Researchers, who questioned tens of thousands of adults, said
middle-aged lifestyles are changing because couples are having children
later and their parents are living longer.
''People in their 40s, 50s, and early 60s who are parents may spend
many years sandwiched between the demands of elderly parents . . . and
their own children,'' concluded the report.
The rapidly-changing world of work is also having a significant effect
on the middle-aged, particularly men, said Mintel.
Many, who may have hoped to reap the rewards of earlier efforts, are
being forced to face the harsh reality of redundancy or early
retirement.
Firms' increasing reliance on new technology and
''results-orientated'' ethos is creating a ''new mood of
disenchantment'' among the over-45s.

Britons would rather relax by watching television or reading a book
than making love, a new survey claimed yesterday.
One in two said their favourite way of unwinding was watching
television and a similar number opted for a book. Only one in three
chose sex, said the survey by medical insurer PPP.

CAMELOT confirmed yesterday that up to 10 Scottish pubs will be among
70 UK licensed premises to be allowed to sell National Lottery tickets
and scratchcards.
However, although some nightclubs in England are likely to be on the
list, to be announced this week, no Scottish venues will feature.
The trial scheme will allow licencees to sell lottery tickets over a
six-month period, with a view to pubs and clubs joining existing Camelot
outlets.
The pubs were nominated by their breweries and will be selected on
grounds of catchment area, turnover and suitability of management.
A spokesman for Camelot also said that serious consideration was being
given to the size of pubs, in terms of having bar capacity to include a
lottery machine and a drinking area fit to deal with extra customers.
However, he did not expect that the move would cause lottery queues.
He added: ''We believe that what people will tend to do will be to
take their tickets back to their table with their drinks and sit down to
scratch their card or pick their numbers.
''Allowing pubs to sell tickets will help rural areas, often without
lottery outlets, where the pub is the focal point.''
He confirmed that pubs would be subject to the same conditions as
shops, paying out a maximum #200 on the premises.

Beijing
DENG XIAOPING was reported in good health for his 91st birthday today
but his 1200 million subjects did not take much notice and his anointed
heirs chose the day to show off who was in charge of China.
The birthday of the squat, gravel-voiced patriarch went unmarked in
the state media in line with Deng's abhorrence of personality cults
after adulation of Chairman Mao Tsetung led China along disastrous
revolutionary roads.
Asked about a change in the condition of the man who led China out of
leftist fervour and economic stagnation to a market revolution, the
Foreign Ministry said he was healthy for a man of his age.
''I think there is at least one change -- he is one year older,''
spokesman Chen Jian joked at a regular news briefing. ''And his physical
condition is still good.''
His chosen successors used the day to turn the media spotlight on
their grip on power and away from their patron, who ditched orthodox
Marxist egalitarianism and told his people that ''to get rich is
glorious''.
However, diplomats said Deng's influence remained apparent as
President and Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng
plastered their pictures across the front page of the People's Daily,
clearly basking in his backing.
''As long as he breathes he will continue to have influence,'' one
diplomat said last week.
Chinese analysts said Deng's power was waning steadily. He has not
been seen for more than a year nor uttered a public word for even
longer.
''If he dies this year there will still be some impact. If he dies
next year . . . it will be like the wind blowing but leaves on the tree
don't even shudder,'' said one senior Chinese academic.
Deng is thought to have suffered serious health problems in the past
year that may have sapped not only his strength but his political power
as well, diplomats and analysts say.
His children insist he is fit enough to walk and plans a triumphal
tour of Hong Kong once the British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty
in 1997.
The People's Daily carried a lengthy commentary on the thoughts of the
reclusive revolutionary, but photographs of his heir Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li, busy with state business and in charge, dominated the front
page.
''They are trying to make the point that the handover of power has
been completed,'' said one political analyst. ''But actually it won't be
finished until he's dead.''
Many diplomats and analysts cite the publication of pictures of Jiang
and Li as evidence of their need to try to fill a decision-making vacuum
developing in the transition between Deng's withdrawal from active
political life and the day when finally, in his own words, he ''goes to
meet Marx''.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>University 'did not act unreasonably' in refusing to offer a place in medical faculty. Appeal on student selection rejected</HEADLINE>

A JUDGE yesterday ruled out claims by a 17-year-old with six A-pass
Highers that Glasgow University treated him unfairly when it rejected
him for a place as a medical student.
Conor O'Reilly alleged the university acted unreasonably and in breach
of the rules of natural justice by failing to inform him that candidates
must have had work experience in a hospital, surgery, or a caring
environment.
However, Lord Coulsfield accepted the university's case that while it
regards work experience as desirable, it is not an essential
precondition for entry to the medical faculty.
Immediately after the legal ruling at the Court of Session, Mr
O'Reilly, of Newlands Road, Glasgow, expressed his disappointment.
He added: ''I am not sure what I am going to do now. I need time to
think about my future and whether it is in medicine.''
Mr O'Reilly, who attended St Aloysius College and has Highers in
biology, chemistry, English, Latin, maths and physics, had unconditional
offers for four other universities, but has turned them down.
His father -- ear, nose and throat surgeon Mr Brian O'Reilly -- said
that, despite the ruling, he thought the case was worthwhile because it
showed other parents the university was open to challenge.
He denied that his son had been pushed towards a medical career, and
added: ''I can't even get him to cut the grass, never mind getting him
to do anything he does not want to.''
A Glasgow University spokesman commented: ''The university is
delighted that the court has confirmed the selection process it uses is
reasonable and fair.
''We note Lord Coulsfield has said that he was clearly of the view the
university had not acted illegally in its selection process.
''The university receives a large number of applications from talented
people for admission to the faculty of medicine. Every year, we
interview some 800 applicants for the 217 places available.
''The university does not believe that a record of academic
achievement at school is a sufficient measure of the suitability of an
applicant to be a doctor. The selection process looks at evidence of
both academic ability and commitment to medicine.''
Earlier, Lord Coulsfield heard claims that, despite his outstanding
academic qualifications, Mr O'Reilly was one of the poorest of 800
candidates who were interviewed for a place in the forthcoming academic
year at Glasgow University's Medical School.
The university alleged he was rejected because he failed to
communicate any enthusiasm for or commitment to a medical career.
Mr O'Reilly went for an interview last December and a week later
received a letter informing him he had been rejected.
Giving evidence in court yesterday, he said that although at the time
of his university interview he did not have any work experience in a
surgery or hospital, he was well aware what a medical career entailed.
Both his parents and a number of relatives were doctors. His sister is
also studying medicine at Glasgow.
''I believe I had both the academic requirements and the sense of
service they were looking for,'' he said.
He agreed with Mr Neil Davidson, QC for the the university, that he
had rejected offers from four other Scottish universities and if he
didn't get into Glasgow he would not be able to study medicine anywhere
else in the forthcoming academic year.
Mr Stuart Macpherson, the Associate Dean of Admissions at Glasgow's
Faculty of Medicine, told the court that, while he would recommend work
experience, it was not a requirement for entry to the faculty.
The view taken on Mr O'Reilly during his interview was that he had
been: ''Entirely unconvincing, has done nothing outwith family or
friends to research medical career. Poor communicator.''
Mr Davidson asked: ''Does the faculty of medicine of the University of
Glasgow require applicants to to do work experience before accepting
them?'' ''No,'' replied Mr Macpherson.
What was mandatory was enthusiasm and commitment to a career in
medicine, and Mr O'Reilly had failed to demonstrate that.
Ms Ruth Stewart, an administrative assistant with the faculty of
medicine who, along with Mr Macpherson, interviewed Mr O'Reilly, said
that, of the Scottish students offered places to study medicine at
Glasgow, 17 had no work experience.
Mr O'Reilly had been rejected because he showed no commitment or
enthusiasm to a medical career.
She added: ''I have seen over 800 applicants this year in Conor
O'Reilly's situation and I would have to say that Conor O'Reilly is one
of the poorest we have seen.''
Lord Coulsfield said that after weighing the evidence he had reached
the clear view there had been no requirement by the university that a
candidate must have work experience to be considered for admission to
the medical faculty.
He dismissed Mr O'Reilly's petition for judicial review of the
university's decision to reject him.

Plymouth, Tuesday,
INHABITANTS on the tiny Caribbean island of Montserrat were allowed
back home to collect belongings tonight after the biggest volcanic
eruption of ash and noxious gases in a month.
However, they were strongly advised to leave before sunset for the
safety of the north of the island and before a curfew was imposed.
Two British holidaymakers were flown 27 miles to the safety of Antigua
in a private plane chartered by their travel company Caribbean
Connection.
A total of 5000 people from the capital Plymouth and a sweep of
villages in the south and east of the island were evacuated.
Buses and cars moved 2000 people to the north of the island, where a
tented city had been built. The others were moved to shelters, community
centres, schools, housed with friends, or slept in their cars.
A team of 33 Royal Marines and 90 crew from the destroyer HMS
Southampton, went ashore to put up tents, supply generator power, and
help local police maintain law and order.
The unarmed marines were sworn in as special constables and set up
road blocks and mounted mobile patrols, as the police headquarters was
moved out of the capital.
The streets of Plymouth were covered with two inches of ash and
visibility was cut to just 15ft.
Farmer Mars Joe was out planting peanuts three miles from Plymouth
when he heard the loud roar of the eruption.
He said it looked as if the Chance Peak volcano, in the Soufriere
Hills, ''split in two'' when the eruption occurred and blacked out the
sun for 10 minutes before raining ash over Plymouth and surrounding
villages.
Islanders donned surgical masks to protect themselves from the ash
that was spewing on to the town and villages.
The eruption was the biggest in a series of tremors that have been
rocking the island since the long-dormant Chance Peak burst into life
July 18.
The captain of HMS Southampton, Commander Keith Winstanley, 34, from
South Hams, Devon, said the evacuation had been orderly.
The ship's Lynx helicopter flew scientists over the volcano to measure
sulphur dioxide emissions and gauge the chances of another eruption.
Figures indicated that there was a more than 50% chance of another
eruption.
Montserrat, which is 11 miles long and seven miles wide, has a
population of around 11,000.
In 1989 Hurricane Hugo swept across Montserrat destroying virtually
everything. A massive infrastructure plan was launched with substantial
aid from Britain.

CALLERS yesterday besieged a telephone helpline set up following
allegations of sexual misconduct by a Church of England priest who ran
''rave for Jesus'' parties.
Counsellors staffing the line were deluged with calls from bewildered
churchgoers following claims linked to the personality cult.
At least 20 women who attended parties held by the Rev. Chris Brain,
38, have made allegations of sexual impropriety. None of the women, who
include former abuse victims, was said to be among yesterday's callers.
However, it is understood some are in a sanctuary set up by church
leaders in the Sheffield diocese.
They have warned that hundreds of churchgoers are likely to need
long-term therapy after being emotionally manipulated by former rock
group manager Mr Brain. Some are said to be suffering from
post-traumatic stress.
It is alleged that, during healing sessions involving the ''laying on
of hands'' at his home, he fondled and indecently assaulted them.
The diocese, which set up the helpline, has suspended Mr Brain, who
ran the radical New Age church in Sheffield known as the Nine O'Clock
Service. The Bishop of Sheffield, the Right Rev. David Lunn, set up an
inquiry.
Mr Brain is said to have established huge personal power over hundreds
of young people attracted to his New Age ceremony. However, he abused
and exploited people's vulnerabilities, said the Archdeacon of
Sheffield, the Venerable Stephen Lowe.
Efforts were being made to offer support and counselling to people in
a guarded ''safe house'', away from media attention. About 10 people
were understood to be staying at the 30-bed residential centre.
About 40 calls were made to the helpline after it opened yesterday
morning and personal visits by counsellors arranged for about 12 people.
Advice was sought from a psychiatrist on how to treat members who were
aged 25 to 35 and included university lecturers, doctors, lawyers,
teachers, and social workers.
The archdeacon added: ''Many of them have given up homes, moved to
Sheffield, given up jobs in some cases because some of them gave their
lives to work full-time for the Nine O'Clock Service.''
On Monday, the archdeacon released a statement signed by Mr Brain, who
is at a secret address in the north of England with his wife Winnie and
five-year-old daughter. It said: ''I deeply regret the sad misuse of
power and control over people which forms the basis of this current sad
situation.''
Around 300 people regularly attended the Nine O'Clock Service at Ponds
Forge International Sports Complex.
Mr Brain was originally a lay member at the services which used banks
of video screens, dry ice, projections, and 5000-watt sound systems. He
was ordained three years ago and left the church last year, saying he
planned to set up a similar organisation in San Francisco, but it is
thought he remained in the Sheffield area.
Sheffield police said they were unaware of the allegations being made.

SCOTLAND'S women suffered their second defeat of the Test series
against Israel when they went down 6-2 at Kfar Maccabiah yesterday.
In the pairs event, Sarah Gourlay and Frances Whyte hit back from 6-12
down after six ends to beat Renee Kusman and Carmel Scop 24-21. The
Scots levelled the match after 10 ends, and by the close of the
fifteenth end led 19-18.
Another five shots gave them a 24-18 cushion with three ends to play,
and they restricted the home side to singles on each of them to run out
24-21 winners.
Maureen Hirschowitz's local side coasted to a 28-10 win in the triples
against Scotland's Betty Forsyth, Eleanor Allan, and Joyce Lindores.
0 The Scots looked as if they might win the afternoon games but a
strong finish gave Israel victory in both. In the fours, Forsyth, Allan,
Lindores, and Whyte came back from being 3-11 down to square at 11-11,
but the Israeli rink, skipped by Hirschowitz, pulled away to win 24-15.
The singles turned into a major disappointment for the Scots when
Gourlay failed to score over the last 10 ends. She and Merle Swerdlow
were tied at 11-11 after 16 ends but Swerdlow then picked up 14 shots
without loss to win 25-11. The third and final Test is on Saturday.
Details:
Israel 6, Scotland 2. Singles -- M Swerdlow 25, S Gourlay 11. Pairs --
R Kusman and C Scop 21, S Gourlay and F Whyte 24. Triples -- I Myers, M
Swerdlow, M Hirschowitz 28; B Forsyth, E Allan, J Lindores 10. Fours --
I Myers, C Scop, R Kusman, M Hirschowitz 24; B Forsyth, E Allan, J
Lindores, F Whyte 15.

IT'S an irresistible scenario for any discerning house hunter -- a
luxury flat or townhouse in a peaceful setting right at the heart of
Glasgow's West End. Relax in the comfort of your own home -- then take a
short stroll into the hustle and bustle of Hyndland.
Home to a cornucopia of amenities, Hyndland is also home to the most
highly acclaimed architectural traditions, traditions which are
furthered within Tay Homes' exclusive Hyndland Gate development, just
off Hyndland Road.
In Hyndland Gate you will find an environment which has been created
with the young, families, and retirement couples in mind. But if it's a
flat you're after, you had better be quick: only seven remain.
''We are in the later stages -- the flats are the only ones left in a
development of 30 -- of the present flatted development before we switch
products,'' said Iain Stewart, sales director. ''Our new showflat -- a
two-bedroomed 'Clarence' -- opens this weekend, and we also have a
three-bedroomed view flat, a Devonshire. There are only seven flats
left; three Clarences, ranging from #102,000 to #104,000, and four
Devonshires, priced #109,750.
''The showflat is marvellous, one of our best, and with a fairly
buoyant market place -- people moving into the West End are selling
their houses OK -- time is running out. This really is your last chance
to get a flat for some time.''
The minute you walk through these luxurious apartments you will be
struck by the immense feeling of space. The quality of construction and
finish attests to the attention to detail. In addition to the space,
Hyndland Gate has proved most attractive to new-home buyers -- a
combination of local people and business people moving into Glasgow --
because of the obvious value for money. Each new home includes the
highest quality fittings: oven, hob, cooker hood, washer/dryer, and
fridge/freezer as standard.
Tay Homes is now turning its attention to a different style of home on
the same prime site. ''The next phase is three and four-bedroom,
three-storey luxury townhouses,'' said Iain Stewart. ''Each has a
garage, some with double garage, a family room, lounge, dining-room, en
suite on the master bedroom, and utility area. They really are most
luxurious.''
The first 10 townhouses have just been released, for completion in the
spring, with prices ranging from #149,950 to #177,950, and two have
already been reserved. There are three styles -- the Victoria,
Kingsborough and Queensburgh, named after local streets. The townhouses
are very Georgian in outlook and design -- again to blend in with the
local architecture.
''The flats have tended to go to younger couples or older couples
moving down, whereas the townhouses are ideal for families.''
Externally the townhouse gardens are turfed front and back, with high
screen fencing between each property, security lighting, and integral
garage. Inside there is a shower room, toilet, or bathroom on each
floor, with a choice of quality suite and tiles; the kitchens include
oven with integrated cooker hood, microwave oven, integrated dishwasher,
washer/dryer, integrated fridge/freezer, and a utility room; the master
bedrooms have fitted wardrobes.
The homes are double glazed, have gas central heating, cornicing in
the lounge, dining room, and master bedroom, and smoke and security
alarms.
This weekend also sees the opening of a sales office at The Crescents,
Tay Homes's design competition-winning development of four and
five-bedroomed detached houses at Stewartfield, East Kilbride.
''We have just started work on the site. There are 58 properties -- 28
houses and 30 flats. The flats will form the second phase and the first
houses have now been released for sale, with prices ranging from #99,500
to #169,500.''
''The company's ethos is to have houses ranging in price from #23,000
up to #180,000 and we try to offer the same quality of build and service
whichever price band the person is buying in,'' said Iain Stewart.

IMAGINE what life in retirement would be like if you could leave
someone else to worry about all the household maintenance, external
decorating and gardening. It's a freedom awaiting anyone who buys one of
McCarthy &amp; Stone's custom-built retirement flats at Giffnock and
Helensburgh.
At Giffnock the company -- Britain's leading specialist retirement
home builder since 1977 -- has just completed one of its smallest, most
intimate developments, called Carleton Court. With only 17 one and
two-bedroom flats on the sought-after Fenwick Road, Carleton Court
offers a secure and comfortable lifestyle for those thinking of moving
to a more manageable property.
Being a small development, Carleton Court will not have a resident
house manager or guest suite but a house manager will visit on weekdays
and, of course, you have the ultimate reassurance of knowing there are
always others around. Pull cords in the main rooms of each flat are
linked to a Careline emergency system which is monitored 24 hours a day
-- a constant reminder that you are never alone should an accident
happen.
The company gives a high priority to security and, in this age of high
crime, many McCarthy &amp; Stone residents speak of the joy of being able to
go shopping or take a holiday without the anxiety of wondering whether
their home is safe.
At Carleton Court a video entry security system offers protection from
the outside -- visitors can be viewed simply by changing channels on
your television set -- while individual alarms guard every flat.
External windows are locking and there are smoke detectors. In
recognition of the security features, Carleton Court has gained approval
in principle by Strathclyde Police in their Secure by Design scheme.
Another attraction is the communal lounge where residents can enjoy
social events, play cards, or just meet for a good natter. There is also
a modern laundry room with washing machines and tumble driers for
residents' use.
All flats include McCarthy &amp; Stone's tried and tested ideas for
retirement living. Each is tailored to the needs of older, active
people, with features like power sockets at a convenient height, and
easy-push light switches.
Kitchens are extensively tiled and fitted with an oven, hob, and
extractor fan. The bathroom is fully tiled and fitted with electric
shower, mirror, shaving point and vanity unit.
Carleton Court is conveniently placed for local amenities -- with
local shops including post office, chemist, optician, newsagent, bank,
and bakers all within 500 yards and Giffnock's attractive shopping
centre less than half a mile from the development. Fenwick Road is the
main bus route serving Glasgow city centre, about four miles to the
north.
Alan Gosland, managing director of McCarthy &amp; Stone Scotland, said:
''There is an increasing demand for specialist retirement housing in
Scotland, as shown by the unprecedented response to some of our more
recent developments. At Carleton Court we have incorporated McCarthy &amp;
Stone's best features in a development of reduced scale. It's small but
perfectly formed.''
Prices for the one and two-bedroom flats range from #65,000 to
#80,000. To view the showflat, contact Linda Jobling on 0141 633 1093.
McCarthy &amp; Stone are also building in Helensburgh, where Kings Court,
in King Street West, provides a range of one and two-bedroom flats with
the usual high level of specification and award-winning security.
The development -- in the west end of Helensburgh on the corner of
King Street West and Glasgow Road -- also features a guest room for
visiting relatives and friends.
A house manager, though not resident, will be based at Kings Court on
weekdays from 9am to 3pm and the development will of course have the
benefit of 24-hour Careline cover.
Helensburgh is unrivalled for its views of the Firth of Clyde. The
renowned Hill House, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, is 1[1/2]
miles from Kings Court, while Loch Lomond is some 6[1/2] miles to the
north.
McCarthy &amp; Stone have successful developments, and contented
customers, all over the UK. Their commitment from the beginning has been
to provide the facilities for a happy and secure retirement. This not
only covers the carefully designed self-contained flats and communal
features within their developments but also the professional
arrangements they have with their managing agents who are responsible
for the day-to-day running of each site.
McCarthy &amp; Stone have entrusted the management of both developments to
Peverel Management Services Ltd, an independent property management
company which has provided a high standard of service for prviate
retirement accommodation throughout the UK since 1982.

THE discovery of three cardboard toilet roll centres taped together
led to the arrest of a man accused of terrorist charges, a court heard
yesterday.
A piece of metal with blue and brown wires attached and a
battery-charger were also found in an early-morning police raid on a
house in Aberdeen, the High Court in Stirling was told.
Detective Sergeant Kenneth Park told the court that the items were
similar to components found in a hoax bomb left on the front steps of
Aberdeen Sheriff Court only hours earlier.
He was giving evidence on the second day of the trial of two men
accused of conspiring to further by criminal means the purposes of the
Scottish National Liberation Army and an organisation called Flame.
Mr Terence Webber, 30, of Farquhar Road, Aberdeen, and Mr Kevin Paton,
27, of Charles Gardens, Inverurie, have denied 17 charges of conspiring
to further the aims of the SNLA by planting hoax bombs, issuing death
threats and sending hoax letter-bombs.
Both men have pleaded not guilty and Mr Webber has lodged a special
defence incriminating two other men, Mr Adam Busby, of Dublin, and Mr
Darren Brown, address unknown.
Detective Sergeant Park said that police raided the flat in Union
Grove, Aberdeen, early on September 8 last year and found the items in a
cupboard in the living room and in a bedroom chest-of-drawers.
He said they were similar to the contents of a hoax bomb found on the
steps of the city's sheriff court the previous evening.
Earlier, the court heard that the streets around the sheriff court
were cordoned off when the package was discovered.
Mr Charles Dowst, an Army bomb disposal expert, described the bomb as
''an imitation shrapnel device'' which contained a camping gas cylinder
and toilet roll tubes containing tacks, screws and nails.
He explained that the purpose of the gas cylinder would have been to
enhance the explosion. Had it been genuine, it could have caused a
fireball.
Detective Sergeant Park said that, after Mr Webber was arrested in the
flat, he explained that the battery-charger was for charging radios in a
kitchen cupboard.
Asked why he had the radios, Mr Webber replied: ''For things that will
happen in the future.''
Earlier, the court heard that Labour MP Mr Tony Worthington received a
chilling ultimatum in a communique from Flame, described in court as a
paramilitary organisation.
This gave him 30 days to ''leave Scotland or die''.
The message was received at the Labour Party's Scottish headquarters
in Glasgow on April 28 last year.
Mr Jack McConnell, secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, said the
letter was headed Flame and there was a picture of a house with a hand
beneath holding a lighted match and alongside the words ''English out of
Scotland''.
Mr McConnell admitted that he did not know where Mr Worthington, MP
for Clydebank, was from originally.
''I think he is probably English, but I am not absolutely certain.''
The court heard that similar correspondence was received by two
newspapers and by the Press Association in London.
The trial continues.

A HOSEPIPE ban is being extended this morning to the 7600 consumers in
Strathspey who will now share the limitations placed on another 21,000
in parts of Ross-shire last week.
This means that 16% of the resident Highland population are affected
by the hosepipe ban while a further 7% are being encouraged to save
water.
According to Highland Regional Council yesterday, the continuing spell
of hot, dry weather is affecting Strathspey's Loch Einich source and
high consumption, some 20% up on normal, had put an unacceptable
pressure on the distribution system. The ban will be reviewed weekly.
A council spokesman said: ''The ban prevents people from using
hosepipes and sprinklers to water their gardens and to wash their cars.
But the ban does not prevent people from watering flowers with a
watering can and washing their car with a bucket and sponge. Neither
does it affect normal agricultural uses and car wash machines.
''There remains a hosepipe ban in Mid Ross and the Black Isle
excluding North Kessock. In some areas throughout the islands, consumers
have been asked to conserve water, particularly in small rural areas, in
order to avoid the possible loss of the public water supply to their
homes if the dry weather continues.''
He said the following areas had been asked to conserve water --
Applecross, Elphin, Lochinver, Ullapool, Dornoch, Ardmair,
Strathkanaird, Lochbroom, Broadford, Kilmuir, Penifiler, Portree
including Snizort, Edinbane, Borve, Skeabost and Kenfaleyre, Sallachy,
Uig, Kyleakin, Achmore, Staffin, Dores, Lochend, Drumnadrochit, Milton,
Strone, Lewiston, East Glenurquhart, Strathnairn, Strontian, Treslaig,
Tomich, Cannich, Balnain, and Ferness.

THE death of animal rights campaigner Jill Phipps under the wheels of
a cattle truck carrying veal calves was an accident, an inquest jury
decided yesterday.
The unanimous verdict at Coventry coroner's court was greeted with
dismay by the Phipps family.
However, Warwickshire police said they were delighted with the
decision, and remained confident that the policing of the demonstration,
codenamed Operation Forest, was well planned and well executed.
Miss Phipps, 31, the mother of a 10-year-old son, was killed on
February 1 when she tried to stop a 50-tonne truck carrying the calves
to Coventry's Baginton airport for export.
The five-day inquest heard that she fell beneath the front wheel of
the lorry during the protest, which followed the resumption of flights
to the Continent.
Mr Michael Mansfield QC, who gave his time free to represent the
Phipps family, claimed during the inquest that confusion over police
tactics had led to Miss Phipps's life being placed in danger.
He said drivers making the deliveries were not given sufficient
instruction on how to react to the campaigners who stood in front of the
lorries.
Several police witnesses, including senior officers, claimed Miss
Phipps had deliberately sacrificed her life for her beliefs.
Her mother Nancy, 70, a veteran campaigner who introduced her daughter
to animal protest at the age of 11, said after hearing the verdict:
''She has just been sacrificed in this stinking, rotten trade and she
didn't deserve to die.
''I hope the Government stops this awful trade in her memory.''
Her words were greeted with applause from around 30 family supporters.
The family refused to rule out the possibility of a private
prosecution against the police or the driver of the truck, haulage
contractor Stephen Yates.
The Crown Prosecution Service has decided not to prosecute the
44-year-old driver for causing death by dangerous driving.
The family said their next task would be to explain the court's
decision to Miss Phipps's son Luke.
Miss Phipps's brother, Zab, 45, said the loss of his sister proved
police tactics had been wrong at the time.
''All these principal police officers were asked in the witness box if
they would do anything different with hindsight. They seemed to say
everything on the day was just so,'' he said.
''Yet at the end of the day our family has been robbed of Jill, so how
can they have got it right?''
Assistant chief constable Mick Brewer, extending his sympathies to the
family, said his officers were not to blame.
''I am delighted with the verdict,'' he said. ''We didn't have the
benefit of hindsight but it was a good operation. The police were not
responsible for Jill's death; regrettably that lies with Jill and her
friends.''
Despite inaccuracies between police witnesses and the force video
recording of the tragic accident, he denied any collusion to present the
inquest with a suicide theory.

WHEN Scots film-maker Bill Forsyth was making his box-office success
Local Hero, his choice of locations might have seemed slightly round the
bend. While its glorious beaches were shot on the west of Scotland near
Morar, the village where the ''locals'' lived was hardly local at all --
in fact it was more than 150 miles away at Pennan, on the east coast.
Situated between Banff and Fraserburgh, Pennan village proved to be an
inspired choice. Its range of quaint houses includes The Bend, a
200-year-old property commanding exceptionally fine views over the old
harbour, the cliffs and the open sea. The accommodation has been so
arranged so that the house can be divided into two halves, if required.
Total accommodation comprises: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, two
reception rooms, and a kitchen. All the rooms take advantage of the
magnificent outlook.
Offers in the region of #119,000 are being sought for the property
through the Logie office of Langley-Taylor or the Fraserburgh office of
Stewart and Watson.

STRONG winds in the afternoon, causing conditions that were too rough
for racing, disrupted the programme of the world championships in
Tampere, Finland, yesterday.
First of all it was decided to postpone the afternoon programme for
two hours and then, with no sign of the wind abating, the decision was
taken to abandon racing completely for the day.
The scheduled afternoon programme will now take place early this
morning before those races originally scheduled for today.
Among the crews affected by the postponement are Britain's women's
four, with Scots Gillian Lindsay and Kate Templeton aboard, and the
men's coxed four which includes Scottish internationalist Cal MacLennan.
Before the weather took its toll, four British crews were in action,
and among those to qualify for the semi-final stages were the men's
eight, which finished third in their heat behind reigning world
champions USA and Germany, and the men's lightweight four, who were
comfortable winners of their heat.
In the lightweight double sculls, Carl Smith and Andy Sinton finished
second behind Swedes Mattias Tichy and Anders Christensson.
Crews already scheduled to be in action in today's repechages include
Britain's women's pair, with Scottish Commonwealth bronze medalist
Kareen Marwick aboard.

YOU would have to be as rich as Croesus to afford an estate which
stretches from one sea to another, but an accident of geography means
that the purchasers of an estate in south west Scotland could walk from
coast to coast and still be on their own property.
The Logan Estate bestrides the Rhinns of Galloway, the narrow
peninsula south of Stranraer -- and while the stormy Irish Sea marks its
western boundary, the quieter waters of Luce Bay forms the eastern limit
of the property. Surrounded by sea in the most southerly part of
Scotland, Logan enjoys a remarkably mild climate and is warmed by the
Gulf Stream.
The 1819-acre estate is being sold in 20 lots and there is something
for everyone -- buyers can choose from ruined cottages from #2000
upwards, or bid over #450,000 for the classical Queen Anne Logan House
with its 400 acres of surrounding gardens and woodland.
The House has three reception rooms, seven bedrooms, and four
bathrooms. It has impressive rhododendron and azalea gardens which
adjoin the well-known Logan Botanic Gardens.
Other lots include two farms, ruined cottages, salmon fishings, and a
variety of plots of ground in the picturesque village of Port Logan and
the surrounding area.
One of the most interesting properties is the fish pond and cottage.
The pond is a natural tidal pool which was hollowed by the sea and
developed at the end of the 18th Century as a fresh fish larder for the
Laird of Logan. As one of the first attempts at fish farming in
Scotland, it became a tourist attraction and the fish can be summoned by
the sound of a bell. The fish pond cottage with its pool, Port Logan Bay
and pier and some two miles of rocky coastline is available as one lot
at offers over #50,000.
Logan estate has been in the ownership of the same family, the
McDoualls of Logan for 700 years. They were thought to be the only
family in area of Pictish origin, tracing their ancestry to Fergus, one
of the ancient lords of Galloway.
John Baliol, Lord of Galloway is recorded as having granted the Lands
of Lougan to Dougal McDouall in 1295. Part of the ruins of the old
medieval castle of Balzieland, the main residence of the family still
stand inside the walled garden (now within Logan Botanic Gardens). This
castle was burnt about 1500, and most charters were lost. In 1504 a new
charter was procured by Patrick McDouall; the document stated that the
McDoualls had held these lands ''beyond the memorie of man''. Since
then, ownership of the estate has passed, almost invariably, from father
to son.
In 1945 Kenneth McDouall, the last direct member of the family died,
leaving Logan to Sir Ninian Buchan-Hepburn. The house and gardens were
sold and belonged for a short time to Mr Olaf Hambro, but were
repossessed by Sir Ninian in 1970, with the excepti on of the walled
garden. In 1969 this was gifted by the Logan Garden Trustees to the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland as an annexe to the
Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. It is now called Logan Botanic Garden
and is managed by the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh and attracts
thousands of visitors each year.
The Queen Anne house is the third house to be built at Logan and was
completed in 1702. It is almost impossible to know whether any part of
the earlier seventeenth-century house exists in the surviving part, but
in the cellar there is evidence of a much older construction.
The village and harbour at Port Logan was developed in the early 19th
century by Colonel Andrew McDouall in a bid to steal Portpatrick's Irish
trade.
Logan Estate has never been on the market before and its total price
is some #1.6m, or in 20 Lots from #2000 upwards.

<HEADLINE>Party leadership tries to play down divisions over operation of women-only shortlists. Labour faces row over candidates</HEADLINE>

ONE of the fiercest debates of this autumn's Labour Party conference
now looks like being on women-only shortlists, as supporters prepare to
counter-attack proposals that they should be scrapped after the next
election.
The Labour leadership yesterday tried to defuse suggestions of an
internal row between Mr Tony Blair and Shadow Minister for Women Clare
Short about the future of the arrangement.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the party's summer campaign manager, sought to
reconcile their views, saying that both agreed that the use of the lists
would be reviewed after the General Election.
Ms Short has not disguised her belief that the women-only shortlists
will need to remain in place longer if women are to form half the Labour
membership at Westminster.
In a radio interview earlier this week, she said there was ''a
chance'' that the lists would be kept. In an interview last month, Mr
Blair said the process had '' not been ideal'' and claimed it was
strictly a one-off experiment, not a view taken by supporters.
Ms Mowlam insisted at a Westminster news conference: ''We are not
going to prejudge it. We don't know how many women will get into seats,
how many of these seats we will win.
''All I do know is that it is making a difference now. We are
selecting women in seats around the country, and that will make a
difference to this place.''
She added: ''We have selected six times more women now than the
Conservatives have. We want to change the nature of Parliament, and that
is what we are succeeding in doing.''
Each party region is required to meet a quota of women candidates for
the next election, based on the number of Labour MPs who are retiring
and non-Labour marginal seats in their area. Women-only shortlists have
been imposed on some local parties, such as Slough, in order to meet the
quota.
Mr Peter Jepson is bringing a case before a north London industrial
tribunal, claiming that he has been illegally barred from contesting
either the new seat of Regent's Park and Kensington or marginal
Brentford and Isleworth. He claims that women feel insulted by the idea
that they could not get elected without special privilege.
Mr Roger Dyas-Elliott, a member of the Bassetlaw party, is threatening
to complain to the Leeds industrial tribunal about being barred from
applying to be candidate for Keighley.
A Labour spokesman said the party was confident, having taken legal
advice, that political parties were specifically excluded from the
provisions of the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act.
Opponents of the shortlists have tabled four hostile resolutions for
the party conference in October. Only one resolution backs quotas, but
even that calls for a reform of the system so that, if not enough
suitable women come forward, a man can be considered.
Supporters of the lists are angry at Mr Blair's view that they are a
temporary expedient. Believing the principle to be firmly established by
overwhelmingly carried conference resolutions in 1993 and again last
year, they did not think it necessary to table resolutions reaffirming
it again.
That will not prevent them mounting a fierce campaign at conference to
block any change.
In 1992 Labour women candidates were successful in winning a number of
marginal seats, apparently disposing of the belief of some in all the
main parties that women candidates are generally less effective
vote-winners.
That cuts both ways, however. Supporters of women-only shortlists say
there is therefore no practical reason for blocking gender balance in
the parliamentary party; opponents say it shows that women can win
candidacies and seats without artificial help.

LABOUR yesterday claimed that the UK's Search and Rescue Service was
in crisis, with rescue stations around the coast regularly undermanned.
The claim follows a letter to Ms Joan Walley, Labour's Shadow
Transport Minister, from Mr Chris Harris, the chief executive of the
Coastguard Agency.
Ms Walley said last night that in the letter he admits that in a key
number of areas around the UK coast the rescue station manning levels
regularly fell below the minimum to deal with emergencies.
The letter detailed the number of days this year when the UK's main
stations were under the required watch level. It shows that there were
38 days where Aberdeen fell below the level, 22 days for Stornoway, nine
for Oban and 59 for Southampton.
''Yet again we are provided with figures which back Labour's claim
that the Coastguard is in crisis,'' Ms Walley said.
''It is clear from the information I have received that as a result of
Government cuts there are large parts of the coast where the Search and
Rescue Service is regularly inadequate.
''The Government should allow the Coastguard service to concentrate on
saving lives, not money.''

A GROUP of senior Euro-MPs are being wined and dined in the Highlands
this week as part of a publicly-funded English language course.
Twenty-three Euro-MPs including a number of former national cabinet
ministers -- are attending a fortnight-long EU-funded course at
Hedgefield Hostel, Inverness, which runs until Sunday.
They have also had two lunch receptions laid on by Highland Regional
Council and Inverness District Council, and yesterday were treated to a
champagne reception by Highlands and Islands Euro-MP Winnie Ewing.
Mrs Ewing met the cost of the lunch, booked Elgin Pipe Band for the
event at her home at Goodwill, Miltonduff, Elgin, and arranged for the

BOWDEN Rose looks worth switching on for in the Invoshire Group
Handicap at Ascot this evening.
Coverage on BBC television of two handicaps and a conditions race from
Ascot's first summer evening meeting would not ordinarily quicken the
pulse. But Bowden Rose should make for good viewing in the five-furlong
event and looks a cracking bet.
The filly always is exciting to watch, a trail-blazing front-runner
who has already won twice at Salisbury and once at Yarmouth so far this
season.
She looked sure to add to her tally in an apprentice race at Newbury
on Hungerford Stakes day when going clear before halfway, only to be
caught late on and fade into sixth.
That effort suggested Bowden Rose is no longer well enough weighted to
win races over six furlongs. But it also left the strong impression that
her early speed would make her very hard to catch when dropped to the
minimum trip.
The filly has not run over five furlongs since her first two outings
as a two-year-old, and is likely to prove capable of a good deal better
than she has shown over longer distances. She can make light of 8st 12lb
to capture the #10,000-added race.
Ninette is a very interesting contender for the conditions race. The
three-year-old has not been easy to train and did not make her debut
until the end of last month.
So trainer John Gosden will have been delighted to see his patience
rewarded as the filly brushed aside her rivals in a maiden at Ripon
without coming off the bridle. Whatever the merits of those she beat,
Ninette is obviously a talented performer.
Gosden is a shrewd judge and it is worth trusting his judgement that
the filly will take this step up in class in her stride.
Hat-trick-seeking Rocquaine Bay can take the George Robey Challenge
Trophy Fillies' Handicap at Brighton. She is opposed by two
last-time-out winners in Coggle and Masuri Kabisa.
Their successes came in modest maiden company whereas Rocquaine Bay is
proven in this grade. She landed a gamble in a well-contested handicap
at Epsom last month prior to outbattling the bang-in-form Soviet Bride
at Salisbury last time.
Upex Le Gold Too, a winner last time out, is taken to go in again in
the opener at Redcar, where Modern Day should have backers leaving the
Yorkshire track with a smile on their face.
In the other evening meeting John Dunlop's Goodwood Rocket looks the
best bet on the card.

THE idea of having a computer to run your home is no longer a sci-fi
dream, as some households in Perth are already finding out.
Imagine a device that allows you to control your energy consumption, a
computer that switches on and off heaters in different rooms and which
can tell you the cost of cooking your evening meal or running your bath.
The power company Hydro-Electric is installing the device, called
Intelligent House Control, into the homes of 24 of its employees in
Perth and another six into local businesses.
The machine looks like a sophisticated phone with a small computer
screen and key-pad. Before leaving home in the morning, the householder
can key in instructions about which parts of the house should be heated
and when. When the computer is told that the household is empty, it will
dial the police station or another number if there is an intruder.
Smoke detectors will instruct the computer to phone the fire station
or a neighbour if a fire starts. The system can also interrogate any
other meter in your home. If you have an oil storage tank in the cellar
it can tell you how much liquid fuel you have left, and it will even let
you know whether you have enough hot water for a bath.
Eventually such systems will be able to close the curtains at dusk or
switch on the electric blanket if you are coming home late.
One problem is that many of us change our plans during the day.
Telling the system to switch on the central heating in time for your
normal return home at 5.30pm is not much use if you decide to work late
or go for a pint, so in future householders may be able to update
instructions by phone.
''This is a very early stage of an exciting project,'' says Steve
Smith of Hydro-Electric's research and development division.
''We're looking at ways of integrating these intelligent phones into
other systems such as home banking and home shopping.''

THE name, Godolphin, so far this season has been synonymous with
big-race winners, like Lammtarra -- seen above winning the Derby --
Moonshell, the Oaks winner, as well as four other Group 1 winners.
Now the syndicate are set to launch their challenge for the Doncaster
St Leger when Classic Cliche returns to racecourse action this weekend.
Classic Cliche has yet to hit the heights of his stablemates but has
performed with credit to finish fourth and fifth in the French and Irish
Derbys. He has a choice of engagements with entries in the listed
Eurolink March Stakes at Goodwood and the Grand Prix de Deauville on
Sunday, with the French race the most likely option.
''It depends on how much rain we get leading up to Goodwood and
Deauville,'' said a Godolphin spokesman. ''Classic Cliche is ready to
run but the top race is the Grand Prix de Deauville.''
If Classic Cliche misses Goodwood the race looks a good opportunity
for Henry Cecil's Kalabo, who had the Godolphin horse one place ahead of
him when third in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot.

DETECTIVES hunting the killer of 24-year-old Edinburgh woman Deirdre
Kivlin, whose body was dumped in a drain, yesterday released details of
where she spent most of the evening before her death.
They hope that sightings of her in a city pub and at a telephone kiosk
may jog memories -- because of her distinctive style of dress.
Detective Chief Inspector Ian Cowden, who is heading a murder
investigation, said yesterday that Ms Kivlin was known to have spent the
evening of Saturday July 8, in the Junction Bar, in West Preston Street,
Edinburgh.
He said that she had spent a considerable part of the evening in the
bar, and that he was anxious to trace patrons who may have seen her.
Adding that she left the bar shortly after 12.30am, he said there was
a positive sighting of her at 1.50am at a telephone kiosk at the
junction of Newington Road and West Preston Street.
He stated: ''I need to know where she had been in that time, and who
she was with. I need to know if she was waiting for someone, or why she
was hanging about there at that time.
''Someone must have seen her, and they may have vital information
which will help our inquiry.''
Detectives feel that the clothes worn by the murder victim, who lived
at Greendykes Drive, Craigmillar, and was well known as a karaoke singer
in Edinburgh pubs and clubs, may help in receiving information from the
public.
She was wearing a beige and fawn anorak, a short black dress and black
blouse knotted to the front, black tights, and black high-heeled shoes.
Her body was found in a drain beneath a manhole cover at tenements in
South Clerk Street last week.

THREE elderly women were killed and 44 other people injured last night
when a coach carrying pensioners ploughed into a JCB digger between
Settle and Giggleswick in North Yorkshire.
Police said the 55-seater coach ended up on its side in a ditch after
it ran into the back of the digger on the A65.
The pensioners were from Sunderland and surrounding villages and were
on their way to a fish-and-chip tea in Skipton.
Mr David Buncle, 36, who runs a falconry centre near the scene of the
crash, said: ''The coach was carrying mainly elderly people. It bounced
off the JCB and landed on its side after skidding into a ditch.''
Passengers said there were no seatbelts fitted in the coach, which a
police spokesman said belonged to Safari Coaches of Hetton-le-Hole, Tyne
and Wear.
The bodies of the dead and injured were taken from the crash scene to
nearby Airedale General Hospital after being cut free from the tangled
wreckage.
A hospital spokesperson said one of the victims died at the scene, one
was dead on arrival at the hospital, and the third died from abdominal
bleeding on her way to the operating theatre.
Most of the injured were elderly but those admitted included others
believed to be helpers.
The JCB driver, Mr Ian Preston, a 32-year-old farm contractor from
Eldroth, near Settle, was detained in hospital with a broken arm. The
coach driver was also believed to have been taken to hospital.
Extra medical staff were drafted in to the hospital about 20 miles
from the crash scene to deal with the emergency.
Dr Morgan said: ''We are delighted with the way everybody had pulled
together and our major accident plan worked extremely well.''
Among those admitted to hospital was a fireman suffering from heat
exhaustion after working at the scene.
The trip to the Yorkshire Dales started badly for the pensioners when
the coach they first boarded broke down shortly after setting off.
They changed vehicles and visited Leyburn and Hawes in North
Yorkshire.
Passenger Sheila Tate, 57, said from hospital last night: ''I just
remember a bang and a swerve. I knew we were going to crash at that
moment and just braced myself.''
Her mother Mrs Ada Lowrie, 78, added: ''I thought 'My God, it's going
to turn over' but somehow we stayed upright going down the banking.
''People were amazingly calm in the situation. There were one or two
screams and shouts, but when everything came to a stop the people who
could just got out as quickly as they could.''
A Safari Coaches spokesman made no comment on the incident, referring
media inquiries to its trade organisation, the Confederation of
Passenger Transport in London.
A CPT spokesman said the coach that crashed was a 1984 model which
passed its annual inspection on August 12.

Stewart Fraser goes by Inverkip for a short cruise.
THERE'S a massive aft cabin in Moody's new S31 cruiser. It fills the
hull, with every indication you could have an eightsome reel in there as
well.
It certainly takes the 18hp Volvo MD 2020 diesel -- hides it, in fact.
Open two covers, and there is the three-cylinder model, on a Saildrive
leg and two-bladed propellor. Very dainty, and very quiet leaving Kip
marina.
In fact, I was wondering if sales manager George McDiarmid had
forgotten to switch on. Yes, he admitted, he'd made the same kind of
mistake himself.
But we'd really decided to sail Bill Dixon's latest design, not go
motoring, no matter how quietly. Iain Robertson took the No.2 jib
forward, hanked it on as I dutifully kept her head to wind.
The main came from under the latched-on cover, was hoisted, and the
ties looped on the companionway handrails. A touch on the strangler and
the Volvo was totally quiet. The problem for owners may be whether to go
for the basic S31, if that isn't an odd phrase for such a well-equipped
craft, or to opt for racing trim as well.
The answer is to be crafty and go to the sales berth where you will
find two, side by side, to check: one in basic form, the other ready for
racing on Wednesday evenings. The differences really lie in fine tuning,
and an extension of control and capability.
Our No.2 was that bit lower cut, almost a deck-lapper. There was no
furling gear, to raise the tack. You have to keep a look out, granted,
but you get that fraction of a knot -- and that's what the racing crowd
want.
The main, by Hood for racing, is loose-footed but gives nothing away
in windward ability. Easing sheets does make for more vivacity, but this
Moody delights in pointing high.
In much the same spirit, we had five jammers on the coachroof, each
side of the companionway. And each with a different colour sheet. You
get your colours right, or you don't win your races.
Basic boat style is three jammers a time, still back to the cockpit
for convenience and ease of handling. We could harden in halyards to a
pair of self-tailing coachroof winches, with the primaries on the
coamings.
The tiller gives a good feel for steering, and there is a slimmer
extension for those who prefer operating well to windward. In place of a
kicker, there is a powerful gas-filled strut which keeps the boom in
position.
There is a sturdy rig, of lowers and spreaders, and the preferred west
coast single fin, ahead of a moderate skeg. Nothing extreme, but
noticeably slimmer and finer overall than the older Moody style.
The main had the usual traveller, mounted across the coachroof, just
ahead of the moulded instrument panel, and with extra purchase added.
This craft also has a GPS set-up. Great for setting waypoints on a
cruise, or buoys to round for racing.
There's an opening transom door over the bathing platform. And that
has the equivalent of a rubber bumper, to cater for stern first berthing
if need be.
Not that anyone takes over a #55,000 boat like this without having
plenty of experience in the background. But Kip is happy to offer
tuition among its many services to hand. Just in case.

Ross Finlay drives a coupe with room at the back.
TOP-PRICED car in the Rover catalogue -- that is, excepting the Range
Rover selection -- is the 800 Coupe at #29,995. Like the 827 and
Sterling saloons and liftbacks, it is powered by the 24-valve V6 Honda
engine, which will obviously disappear from this application when
whatever model is due to replace the present 800 makes its bow.
While Rover and Honda have gone their generally separate ways, it is
one thing to disentangle financial connections, another plate of sushi
altogether to do the same with engineering and design. It will take
quite a time for the Anglo-Japanese element to be eliminated completely.
For the moment, the 800 Coupe has a smooth 2.7-litre engine in place,
and Rover has no immediate access to another unblown V6.
This is the only Rover offered with a take-it-or-leave-it
specification. There is just one version, pretty lavishly equipped, and
with the main options available at no extra cost. The price tag includes
either manual or automatic transmission, and either metallic or
non-metallic paintwork.
The test car was elegantly but discreetly coloured, with British
Racing Green metallic exterior and beige leather upholstery. For the
umpteenth time I found myself wishing Rover did something other than
beige fascia trim with a black steering wheel.
Otherwise, though, the 800 Coupe had a well-presented interior,
allowing for the flaw in every 800, that the angular fascia design now
looks very old hat.
There are no complaints about the equipment available on the two-door
coupe, which comes at a premium price largely because it has a one-off
body style. Cruise control and a good air-conditioning system are
standard. So is a sound system with a CD autochanger. Hand-sewn leather
makes for suitably posh seating, and there is just enough use of burr
walnut veneering for it not to be overdone.
I was particularly impressed by the design and adjustment range of the
heated front seats. They are very supportive. The electric adjustments
to seat-back rake, fore-and-aft movement, and in particular to height,
mean that any driver should be able to select a really comfortable
position at the wheel, with that under-thigh support which so few cars,
even in this class, seem to offer. After some worthwhile time spent
fiddling with the seat adjustment I had just the driving position I
wanted, the top of the wheel rim placed below the bottom line of the
windscreen.
Any car called a coupe instantly conjures up a vision of something
with plenty of room in the front cabin but strictly rationed space in
the back. The Rover manages to provide good passenger room in the rear,
where the seats are not only low-set but also -- unusually -- offer
plenty of support. There is generous luggage space in the fairly
''high-roofed'' boot. In fact, if you look at this car side-on for long
enough, you begin to wonder if the low bonnet line and high boot line
match each other at all.
With 169bhp and a fair torque curve, the bulky 800 Coupe gets off its
mark quite smartly. Even as an automatic it will reach 60mph in under 10
seconds, and progress to a test-track maximum on the high side of
130mph. Anti-lock brakes haul it down to lower speeds with ease.
Most owners regard it as a leisurely long-distance cruiser, and that
is where the well-built coupe is at its best. It is no GT car. The
handling is safe but hardly sporting, although a delicately treated
coupe, not hauled around, will put up some brisk average speeds on
varied roads. The drawback is a level of suspension control which just
will not accept much in the way of undulations or sudden bumps. Rover
mutters that Honda unexpectedly changed the engine mountings on this
engine, and that that is where the problem lies. If you accept that, and
go for a restrained driving style, you will hardly notice.

FINDING a site for that dream home may seem a daunting business --
until you start looking. Checking with your local architect, builder or
council can often reveal a surprising number of possibilities, at
varying prices, which may even be the subject of planning permission.
Check your newspaper, and specialist magazines for those little ads,
usually just a few lines, which appear in odd corners of the property
pages.
Remember that all prices are negotiable, especially if the site is
some way from essential services (water, electricity and gas), or not
served by public transport.
As for money, you will need to find a minimum of 25% of the land
value, but in reality rather more. Your bank or building society can
help with the mortgage -- and they will not be too concerned even if you
announce your intention of laying every brick yourself.
But building a house is a fairly complex business and there are many
pitfalls that have to be avoided if you are to complete it successfully.
This makes it essential to consult as early as possible, and the first
professional to speak to is an architect. It is preferable, but not
essential to deal with one you know and have used before. Small
practitioners are a good bet as they are more likely to become
personally involved, not just in the design but for full management,
site inspection and ''hand holding'', for which you can expect to pay
around 6%-8% of your costs. This will be lower if he is only consulted
regarding drawings for the local planning department, but in my own
experience paying for full management of the project is well worth it.
A list of Chartered Architects in Scotland appears in Yellow Pages
under The Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland. If none of
those shown is near you, information on other chartered architects can
be obtained from RIAS on 01345 626745.
As for local authorities, Building Control charges are around #300 for
a house, with planning application #160. Remember don't start work on
your site before plans have been approved. This can take around three
months, but there are plenty of other things you can organise in the
interim.
If you do not plan to do the work yourself, find a local builder with
a good reputation to give you a detailed quotation, not an estimate.
This should be in writing, showing start and completion dates and any
cost penalties for over-running. And obvious as it may seem, don't pay
for any work in advance.
On the other hand if all you are likely to require is a squad of
skilled tradesmen, assemble them and give them all the information you
have on when and where materials will be delivered. They will then
organise an overlapping schedule among themselves to keep the project
running smoothly.
Daunting? of course it is, but the end result makes up for it. Who
could get as much satisfaction simply by collecting a set of keys at a
site office?

THIS year around 16,000 families will embark on one of the biggest,
most frustrating and strangely enjoyable exercises of their lives --
building their own dream home.
Astonishingly 30% of all detached houses completed last year were
self-build units, accounting for 8% of the total new homes market.
According to the most recent information from Individual Homes
magazine these figures, impressive as they are, will rise by another 6%
next year as more of us take steps to avoid falling into the negative
equity trap.
This phenomena of falling demand, and subsequently prices, has wiped
as much as 40% off the value of some new homes, leaving their owners
imprisoned and sometimes financially distressed in the very houses they
had purchased in order to give themselves a better quality of life.
It will be of little comfort to those caught in the trap to realise
that it could have been avoided -- if they had taken matters into their
own hands.
In the self-build sector, only the over-large houses erected on hugely
expensive plots or poorly finished examples will be valued at less than
they cost to build, so the concept is well worth some detailed
examination.
It is also excellent value for money, which is why it is attracting an
increasing number of sports and entertainment personalities into the
ranks of self-builders. Two recent converts are golfer Nick Faldo and
former Page Three model, now television presenter, Linda Lusardi.
They probably spent rather more than the average on their houses,
which in Scotland means between #20,000 to #50,000 for a site and
#40,000 to #60,000 on the actual construction.
If you are working on a tighter budget, don't despair. Out of town
sites with outline planning permission can still be had for as little as
#12,000 and many people manage to keep the total cost under #30,000 by
doing as much of the work as they can themselves.
Even if this amounts to no more than labouring, the savings can be
substantial. In fact, unless you are both knowledgeable and proficient,
specialist jobs such as facing brickwork, electrical wiring and tackling
drains is best left to the skilled tradesman.
So given the various headaches that are likely to arise -- or are
certain to manifest themselves -- why do it? The financial aspect has
already been touched upon. Quite simply you get much more house for your
money. How much more? Think in terms of between 10% and 30% and you
won't be far off the mark.
The new house can also be sited where you want it, rather than on a
pre-determined plot surrounded by many other homes, all exactly the
same.
There is also the fact that it really can be the home of your dreams.
You plan it, you arrange it and you decide whether the kitchen should be
bigger than the lounge or vice-versa.
You want to incorporate a home cinema, indoor swimming pool or fully
equipped office? There will be few problems with any or all of these --
assuming you have budgeted for the extra cost. The suppliers of house
kits long ago realised that there is no such thing as ''standard'' in
this field and will find solutions to almost any problem, no matter how
complex it appears.
They can also supply very attractive designs of their own which will
save the purchaser a whole lot of money and cut the actual construction
time to a minimum.
Most even offer a choice of kitchen and bathroom fitments, and can
point you in the direction of reputable suppliers (and sometimes good
local builders) as well as providing answers to any queries you may
have.
Some -- Torwood Homes is an example -- will provide an informative
video which neatly wraps the whole procedure, from first steps to moving
in, into a half-hour package.
Self-build can be the solution whole groups of people have been
seeking to obstacles encountered elsewhere.
The mushrooming of homeworking, for example, places design demands not
usually met by the standard three-bed semi. Disabled people can also
have houses tailored to their exact requirements, from easy exterior
entry to lowered electrical switches and even kitchen furniture.
If you are keen on energy conservation, the combination of a
timber-framed home, efficient heating and very high standards of
insulation you specify is also unlikely to be part of a commercial
package.
These are just some of the reasons why, in countries such as the US,
Sweden and Norway, more than 80% of new homes are self-built.
It will take some time for us to catch up, but we are getting there.

ZAIREAN troops yesterday stepped up the forced repatriation to Rwanda
and Burundi of thousands of refugees while 85,000 fled their camps to
hide in the countryside.
With signs of food shortages in the region looming, refugee families
plunged into woods, forests, national parks, villages and on to hills in
an attempt to escape.
Officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
said 11,000 refugees had been expelled since Saturday.
They said Zairean troops were engaged in rapes, beatings and looting
against the refugees.
At Mugunga camp near the Zairean town of Goma, soldiers rounded up
more than 1700 refugees at gunpoint, forced them on to buses and trucks
and dumped them on the border with Rwanda.
UN officials said at least 25,000 Rwandan refugees had fled Mugunga,
usually home to 150,000, to surrounding hills and forests to escape the
Zairean army crackdown.
About 60,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees were also reported to have
fled from four camps near Uvira town into hills and villages and would
run out of food within days.
Mr Tony Stadler, UNHCR head in Uvira, said four camps had been emptied
and looted clean by troops.
Roadsides around other refugee camps swarmed with men, women and
children preparing to leave and the UN reported increasing tension
because troops robbed and beat up refugees.
Undaunted by condemnation from around the world, Zairean authorities
say the expulsions will continue until the UN takes responsibility for
the return of more than a million Rwandans and 70,000 Burundians.
Mr Kamanda wa Kamanda, Zaire's Foreign Minister, said the expulsions
were aimed at scotching allegations that Zaire was helping to train
refugees to destabilise Rwanda and Burundi.

EXCLUSIVE
FEARS have been expressed over the success of next year's Burns
International Festival, which is seen as a vital boost to the economy of
South-west Scotland.
Already Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council has set up a separate
fund, seen by some observers as a contingency against failure, and an
expert on Robert Burns has claimed organisers have ''missed the boat''.
A partnership of local authorities, enterprise companies and the
private sector was set up last year to set up the 1996 festival.
With just over four months left before the start of the year of
celebrations, however, there are still gaps in the programme and plans
for certain events have still to be finalised.
In recent days it has emerged that a large public relations and
marketing company has been called in to help the festival organisers,
who must now get the message across in what may turn out to be an
impossibly short time-scale. As one industry observer put it: ''They may
be coming in as the white knights, but they may also find they are
drinking from a poisoned chalice.''
Enterprise Ayrshire, one of the major financial backers of the
festival, has also taken action by seconding one of its senior
executives to the festival company.
The event was launched last year, for reasons never fully explained,
at a venue in Edinburgh, and hailed as the largest-ever international
celebration of the life and work of Scotland's national Bard.
Since then, however, the organisers have remained largely silent about
their plans for the 12 months and events are listed as having ''a member
of the royal household in attendance'' and ''an international star as
principal soloist'' without further details.
Mr Sam Gaw, former world president of the Burns Federation, said:
''Many aspects of the festival are a complete nightmare, but what
saddens me most is that this is a missed opportunity which will not be
repeated in our lifetimes.'' He said that festival director Mr John
Struthers had been made a scapegoat in a situation not of his making and
that he had been brought in too late and starved of funding.
Mr Gaw added: ''I believe that, with the festival only now trying to
get its act together, the markets in North America and Australia have
been lost and it may even be that Europe will be lost, too.''
Mr Struthers, former director of Exeter and Devon arts centre, who is
now being assisted by Barkers on the PR and marketing of the festival,
said: ''I came in around May 1994 with a job to do on a limited budget
and I believe that much has been achieved by what was essentially a
one-man band.''
He added: ''Now I have more funding in place and more staff and we are
ready to go out and tell people what is happening and when. The
programme is in almost complete form and we will have many exciting
projects to announce in the coming weeks.''
Mr Struthers said: ''I admit that in the search for funding I have
sometimes neglected the public relations side of things. I am sorry and
now intend to put that right.''

THE Morrison group, chaired by Highlands and Islands Enterprise
chairman Fraser Morrison, knew what was in the brief for the contract to
establish the new Northern water authority headquarters in Inverness
before it was sent out to competitors, The Herald can reveal.
Labour last night called for a police inquiry into the issue,
involving a #2m plus contract.
When the water authority, chaired by Mr John Robertson, the Highland
Health Board chairman and an HIE board member since 1991, approached HIE
for appropriate firms to discuss the HQ coming to Inverness, the only
name suggested was Morrison.
The Herald also understands that HIE made a presentation to the water
authority exclusively promoting Morrison.
As a result Morrison Development Ltd was able to lodge a planning
application at Inverness division planning office on Friday, August 11,
which fitted the water authority's brief right down to car parking
spaces and a three-car garage.
This was on a site at the Beechwood Business Park owned by Morrison
and near to Highland Regional Council's water and sewerage department.
Other firms in the area did not receive the brief or the invitation to
tender until Monday, August 14 and were told, by chartered surveyors DM
Hall, to submit proposals by Wednesday, August 16, just three days
later.
The decision to locate in Inverness and not Aberdeen, Dundee, or
Perth, had only been taken by the water board at its first meeting,
which was in Edinburgh on Tuesday, August 8.
When the Morrison Group was asked yesterday about the remarkable
similarity between the brief and its planning application, a spokesman
said: ''Well I should hope so. We have been chasing this for a long
time.
''We were very anxious they would come to Inverness and there has been
a lot of contact. Obviously Fraser knows John Robertson, but there are
other contacts as well. So we knew what was in their minds and could
lodge the application. Just a case of Morrison's working hard.''
A spokesman for the water authority insisted Morrison had no real
advantage. Mr Robertson and officials had toured the board area talking
to the different councils.
Subsequently the authority was approached by the local enterprise
agencies, understandably anxious that the new headquarters, plus the
80-100 jobs, would be located in their respective areas.
The authority had then sought advice from the enterprise companies as
to which firms should be consulted in a general way. ''We indicated our
general specifications to them in each of the areas (Highland, Grampian,
and Tayside) and asked for the name of an appropriate builder or
developer. HIE came up with Morrison's.''
He said other companies now had a chance to tender and he was not
aware of any bad feeling amongst competitors.
The Herald, however, has obtained a letter from another company which
had written to the water authority offering to meet to discuss its
accommodation needs. Despite the fact that the authority by then was
involved in discussions with Morrison, it replied saying it was too
early to consider such a meeting.
One industry source told The Herald last night: ''It is utterly
ludicrous to say that Morrison didn't have an advantage. By their own
admission they have been working away at it for months now.''
Mr David Sutherland, managing director of the Tulloch Group,
criticised the timescale laid down. ''I do not see why we had to work
against the clock in this way for a publicly funded project. Three days
is simply not sufficient to do it justice, particularly when you bear in
mind the investment that goes into preparing the bid.''
A spokesman for HIE last night defended the agency's role. He said HIE
had promoted Inverness and elsewhere in the Moray Firth area, including
Averon House in Alness.
''We worked with Morrison's on the Inverness end of this because
they'd been working on it at their own instigation for some considerable
time. In that sense the private sector had already responded speedily to
an opportunity known to all and were promoting a logical site next to
HRC's new water department.
''We would clearly have mentioned Morrison's to the water authority
given HRC's own promotion of Beechwood which took into account
Morrison's ownership of the site.''
He said the final choice of site was entirely up to the water
authority but it would be achieved with no public cash being put in by
HIE.
Labour's industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, who has led criticism of
Mr Robertson's position as the Highland ''quango king'', led last night
for a police inquiry into the revelations.
''These disclosures epitomise the rottenness of the quango system and
its potential for abuse. If Michael Forsyth has any guts he will ask for
the resignations of both Mr Robertson and Mr Morrison.''
Mr Wilson said it was a piece of nonsense that public money was being
wasted on new water headquarters in the first place.

Frances Horsburgh, Local Government Correspondent, writes: The new
West of Scotland Water Authority is expected to base itself in what is
at present the water services department of Strathclyde Regional Council
in Glasgow.
A decision that the water quango, which will take over council-run
services in the Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway area, be located
in the region's Balmore Road offices is likely to be confirmed at the
first full formal meeting of the board tomorrow.
The East of Scotland Authority which meets for the first time later
today is expected to agree to base itself in offices in a business park
on the west side of Edinburgh.

A MAN was taken into custody last night after a four-hour armed police
siege of a house in Clarkston, Glasgow.
The incident began with a disturbance at a house in Drumby Crescent at
about 2.30pm. Policemen called to the scene were confronted by a man who
had what appeared to be a handgun.
Police immediately initiated ''containment'' procedures and an armed
response vehicle and tactical firearms officers took up position outside
the house. Drumby Crescent and Drumby Drive were cordoned off and
sections of some roads nearby also were closed to traffic.
A team of trained negotiators took cover behind vehicles and used
loudhailers to talk to a man who appeared at the windows and the door.
At an early stage in the incident, all the windows in the house were
broken. Later, a strong smell of gas began to come from the property. As
a precaution, gas workers were called in to cut off the supply in the
immediate area, affecting between 70 and 80 households.
Because of fears of a gas explosion, fire engines joined the fleet of
police vehicles and ambulances which lined the streets around the
incident.
At first, residents in the houses near the siege scene were advised to
stay inside. However, later police began to consider ways of safely
evacuating them in case of an explosion.
The 30-year-old man at the centre of the incident is single and
unemployed. It is understood he lives with his parents in a
semi-detached villa. It is believed his mother may have been in the
house when the incident started but left before he barricaded himself
in.
Mrs May Gerrard, who lives in Eastwoodmains Road opposite the entrance
to Drumby Drive which leads on to Drumby Crescent, said: ''There were
police cars and an ambulance and the fire brigade, just across the road
from us. It just built up from there -- more and more emergency service
vehicles arrived. There have been police officers with guns going up and
down the road.
''It is very sad. It is such a shock. We have never seen anything like
this happen here before.''
As the siege continued, residents in houses nearest the scene who
arrived back from work were not allowed access.
After the siege ended at 6.45pm, a police spokesman said: ''A man is
in custody and will be the subject of a report to the procurator-fiscal
at Paisley in connection with various offences.''
He added that the man had surrendered to police and nobody had been
hurt during the incident. The man is expected to appear at Paisley
Sheriff Court today.

SCOTTISH Eastern Investment Trust surged ahead during the six months
to July 31, boosted by the investment of more than #20m of borrowed
funds on buoyant world equity markets.
The #764m trust managed by Martin Currie of Edinburgh saw net asset
value rise by 18% to 103.8p per share, outpacing a 13.4% rise in the FT
Actuaries World Index and a 15% rise in the FT All-Share index over the
same period.
The interim dividend was raised 6% to 0.55p per share from 0.52p last
time and earnings per share rocketed 69% to 1.18p.
''Particularly good performances were achieved by the North American
and Continental European portfolio, while, following an excellent 1994,
the trust's unlisted investments continued to add significant value for
shareholders with six major realisations,'' Martin Currie said.
Scottish Eastern has total borrowings of #102m, of which more than
#25m are still held in cash. But fund manager Eric McAuslan said these
balances would be fully invested in emerging markets in Asia and Latin
America over the next month.
''We are looking to an increased exposure in South America, which will
possibly include a return to Mexico,'' he said.
Besides investing available cash, the trust may switch some
investments from North America, now seen as fully valued, into emerging
markets, he added.
