POLICE have appealed to parents and youngsters to beware of the
dangers of the railways after two incidents in the West of Scotland, one
involving a 13-year-old boy allegedly found travelling on the outside of
a moving train.
Detective sergeant Alex McGuire, of British Transport Police in
Glasgow, revealed that a young boy had been arrested and charged in
connection with an incident at Balloch on Wednesday and a report
submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
In a second incident on Wednesday, officers were called to Pollokshaws
where a 6ft long freezer had been thrown on to a track.
Mr McGuire said he was concerned that, with the arrival of the Easter
school holidays, the railways would become ''natural playgrounds''.
He hit out at the ''mindless morons'' who put objects on rail lines or
threw stones at trains. Recently, a bed settee was found on a track in
the Aberdeen area.
''What mentality is it that possesses people to do this?'' asked Mr
McGuire. ''Vandals don't see the consequences of throwing stones, they
don't see the glass embedded in someone's eyes.''
However, he praised the members of the public who reported Wednesday's
incidents in Glasgow and Dunbartonshire and urged people to give
continued co-operation to officers trying to combat vandalism.
At the start of March, the British Transport Police in Scotland
launched a two-month national campaign aimed at a crackdown on rail
vandals.
Codenamed Operation Rhino, officers are targeting offences of
trespassing, stone-throwing, vandalism, and line obstructions.
Special unmanned trains carrying teams of police officers,
plain-clothes teams, and school campaigns are all being used in the
operation.
Last summer, a train travelling between Wemyss Bay and Greenock was
derailed by concrete blocks placed over the line, resulting in the
deaths of a passenger and the driver. Later, two youths were each jailed
for 15 years.
Mr McGuire expressed disappointment that last month three adults had
been killed taking short cuts across rail lines, two in Glasgow and one
in Edinburgh.

AS a result of a Law Lords ruling against Home Secretary Michael
Howard, around 8000 Scottish criminal compensation cases will probably
have to be reviewed.
Glasgow lawyer Frank McGuire, of Robin Thompson and Partners, who
acted for 13 unions opposing the fixed tariff criminal compensation
scheme, introduced last April, said the cases would have to be looked at
again after Mr Howard's action in not going back to Parliament for
approval was ruled unlawful.
For victims of the most serious crimes, it could mean a ten-fold
increase in the amount of compensation received.
''Not only has Mr Howard caused people problems by giving them low
compensation but he has shot himself in the foot by causing a massive
administrative nightmare. The tariff scheme was supposed to be simpler
but it has only resulted in this backlog,'' said Mr McGuire.
Last night, the Law Society of Scotland president, Mr Kenneth Ross,
welcomed the ruling.
''I am absolutely delighted at the decision. The overwhelming opinion
is that the old system should be retained, as it did more to help
victims. The fixed-tariff system would not have properly compensated
victims for serious injuries sustained through no fault of their own. In
particular, it did not take account of any loss of income, which would
normally form a big part of a claim,'' he said.
Mr McGuire cited two examples: a rape victim who, under the
fixed-tariff scheme, would receive a #7500 payment, without any
consideration of the psychological problems suffered or effect on their
career, and the family of a victim of a fatal road accident who would
receive a #10,000 payment, without any account of the loss of earnings.
Although the Government could attempt to introduce emergency
legislation to support Mr Howard's stance, it is believed this is
unlikely to succeed.
Among those affected by the ruling are Mrs Margaret McKee, 33, whose
husband Arthur died in the Greenock train crash last June -- for which
two youths were convicted -- and her 13-year-old son Mark, of
Baillieston, Glasgow.
Under the fixed tariff scheme, Mr McKee's widow and son would receive
a fixed sum of #10,000. Mr McGuire said he would now be pursuing a claim
for full compensation on their behalf.
''The fixed figure was just a token, it's an insult really. It does
not compensate Mrs McKee for the trauma of losing her husband, the
financial aspect of losing the family's breadwinner, the loss of
practical help, and the loss of a father's support,'' said Mr McGuire.
The Law Lords decision was also welcomed by Mr Bill Speirs, deputy
general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Council, who said tens,
if not hundreds, of thousands of union members were at risk of injury
through their work.
He said: ''It is regrettable that so many people were forced to go
without compensation, which they should have had as victims of violence,
because of Michael Howard's actions.''

TOKYO: Members of a cult suspected of a Tokyo subway nerve gas attack
which killed 11 people have secretly buried enough deadly sarin to kill
10 million more, a magazine report here said yesterday. The Weekly

HUNDREDS of children yesterday took advantage of their election day
off by checking out the technology of the future as seen by their
contemporaries, at an exhibition in Glasgow.
The Mitchell Theatre displayed 26 different visions of a new planet,
designed as part of a Young Technologists competition sponsored by
ScottishPower and the energy charity, Heatwise.
Eaglesham primary school's scheme for the new planet, named Rupert,
caught the eye of the judges. The prize was a trophy and #500.
The schools had been asked to design a space station for planet
Rupert, where the environment lacked running water and fossil fuels.
The runners-up also received cash prizes, with #400 going to Milngavie
primary and #300 to Lothian's Queensferry primary.
Six other schools accepted an advanced challenge, which involved
making a rocket launcher capable of firing a mini-rocket as part of the
space station.
Dykehead primary school from Shotts won this section, receiving #500.
There were no runners-up in this category.
The children's efforts were applauded by a spokesman for Scottish
Power, who said: ''The challenge to create a powered space station on a
barren planet was very difficult but the winning school proved they have
got the right stuff to be the technologists of the future.''

THE United Nations flag flies at half mast in George Square. Below it,
about 30 people gathered yesterday to reflect upon how, a year ago, the
organisation failed to prevent the death of more than one million
Rwandan people.
''Rwanda is a beautiful country; a little like Perthshire with
bananas,'' says Mr Duncan MacLaren, the director of the Scottish
Catholic International Aid Fund.
''There are 16,000 awaiting trial in Rwanda's prisons yet, one year
on, not one person responsible for the massacre has been tried.
''Rwanda has become a festering sore which threatens the stability of
neighbouring Burundi and Tanzania.
''We call upon the UN and its governments to set up a tribunal to try
those responsible for the massacres. Then the restructuring of Rwanda
can begin.''
Mr Mike Watson, Labour MP for Glasgow Central, said the world had
looked with disbelief and horror at the inability of the UN to prevent
the tragedy. He said the onus was now on the UN to establish an
effective judiciary in Rwanda and bring to justice those responsible for
the appalling crimes.
Mrs Lesley Bilindi, whose husband was killed in Rwanda, said there was
a need to look beyond the suffering and death.
''The people of Rwanda are showing such humanity and, given help to
bring those responsible to justice, they will rebuild their country.''
Mr Paul Nzacahayo, a Rwandan who is studying in Edinburgh, felt there
was a need for counselling for those affected. They needed to know that
they were not alone.
''It is important that the world remembers what happened in my country
and for people to learn . . . it has happened before and could happen
again, somewhere else.''
Elsewhere, Baroness Chalker, the Overseas Development Minister,
yesterday said Britain had given Rwanda #89m over the last year to help
rebuild itself.
She played down reports that the Foreign Office's only representative
in the country was about to be pulled out.
''We haven't taken the decision,'' she said, ''I certainly am
extremely aware of the huge number of tasks to be done, not only to
rebuild the police, but to keep the peace in the country.
''We have to learn to do business with governments where they're
elected and sometimes where they are not elected. But I hope that the
new government there are going to continue to respect human rights.
''There have been some problems recently but nothing of the scale of
last year, and the Government of Rwanda are trying extremely hard first
of all to set up law and order, to help people rebuild their lives, to
bring people back from . . . the camps.''

A BUSINESSMAN was given two life sentences yesterday for brutally
''executing'' his fiancee's parents to get his hands on her #150,000
inheritance.
Jonathan Jones, 34, secretly drove 200 miles from his home in
Orpington, Kent, to the isolated South Wales farmhouse of Mr Harry Tooze
and his wife Megan, where he murdered them with a shotgun after sharing
a cup of tea.
Mr Tooze, 64, and his wife, 67, were both shot in the back of the head
from close range and died instantly. Neighbours who heard shots thought
Mr Tooze was shooting rabbits.
Jones then returned to the flat he shared with the couple's only
daughter, Miss Cheryl Tooze, 34, pretending he had spent the day looking
for rented offices to set up a market research firm.
Police later found the bloodstained bodies of the elderly couple
hidden under hay bales in a cowshed at their smallholding at Llanharry,
Mid Glamorgan.
Jones, bespectacled and 6ft 4in tall, even attended a news conference
where Miss Tooze made an emotional TV appeal for information to help
catch the killer.
He was arrested and charged five months after the double murder
although police could find no forensic evidence for the prosecution
case.
There was no evidence from his clothes or car to link him directly to
the murders and the murder weapon was never found. However Jones's
thumb-print was found on a saucer at the farmhouse.
After a 12-week trial at Newport Crown Court, Gwent, Jones was found
guilty of the double murder by majority 10-2 verdicts after the jury
spent two days deliberating the case.
Sentencing him to concurrent life sentences, Judge Mr Justice Rougier
said Jones had been found guilty of the ''ruthless and terrible''
killings of the couple in July, 1993.
The judge said: ''It was the planned and pitiless execution of a
harmless couple who should have had nothing from you except your
affection and respect.''
Jones shook his head as he was led away.
Miss Cheryl Tooze was not in court for the verdicts but she has stood
by Jones since his arrest.
The court heard Jones and Miss Tooze were regularly in arrears with
their rent and Jones had planned to set up his own market research firm,
although he had less than #100 in his bank account.
The court was told Jones had known that Miss Tooze was the sole
beneficiary of her parents' estate.
Police discovered the bodies of Mrs and Mrs Tooze after their anxious
daughter was unable to get a reply on the phone to her mother, whom she
rang every day.
Giving evidence during the trial, Miss Tooze said she did not believe
that Jones had killed her parents.
''If I thought Jonathan was guilty I would say so. I wouldn't protect
him over this.'' she said.
Miss Tooze quit her #17,000 job 10 days before her parents were shot,
to set up the market research business with Jones. Since the murders,
she has been treated for post-traumatic stress and is taking
tranquilisers.
The jury also heard of several hours' delay in sealing off the scene
of the crime because police first suspected suicide rather than murder.
Jones gave evidence in his own defence, insisting on his innocence and
claiming he was ''like a son'' to Mr Tooze.
''We spent a lot of time together and I think we had a close
relationship -- as close as it could be,'' he told the court.
Many of the elderly couple's relatives packed the court and gasped
with relief at the guilty verdict.
Later, Mrs Tooze's cousin, Mrs Barbara Radcliffe said: ''We all
believe it was the right verdict. Harry and Megan have had justice at
last. This catastrophe has been a terrible strain on us all for the last
two years.''

CANADA is negotiating the lease of four former Royal Navy
diesel-electric submarines in return for writing off the rent for
British Army training facilities in Alberta and an RAF bombing range at
Goose Bay, Labrador.
The Upholder-class submarines, the most advanced in the world, cost
the British taxpayer almost #1000m to build and commission. But they
were mothballed within months of completion because of defence spending
cutbacks.
The RN was given the choice between operating the ultra-quiet patrol
boats or being given the go-ahead for a #170m helicopter assault ship to
support the Royal Marines. It chose the assault ship.
The Canadians were the UK's first choice for a bargain-basement sale
of the Upholders. But Ottawa has also slashed its defence budget over
the last two years and can no longer afford an outright purchase.
Negotiations between the two governments are now within one or two
months of a conclusion.
The British Army operates permanent tank and artillery training
facilities at Suffield and Wainright in south-eastern Alberta. An
average of six armoured battlegroups and three battalion combat teams
train there each year on tens of thousand of acres of empty prairie.
The area is about 200 miles south of Calgary, almost totally
unpopulated, and offers a unique opportunity for exercises using live
ammunition at realistic battlefield ranges.
The RAF also uses mountainous and also unpopulated areas of Labrador
to practice low-flying and ground attack techniques at levels down to 50
ft. Low flying in the UK is limited to a minimum of 250 ft to avoid
civilian complaints about noise and disturbance of livestock and wild
animals.
If a deal is signed by early summer, Canadian submarine crews are
likely to arrive at Faslane on the Clyde for a training and
familiarisation course on the Upholders.

A HOSPITAL yesterday had to set free a patient diagnosed as suffering
from paranoid schizophrenia -- even though doctors consider he is too
dangerous to be released into the community.
The authorities were left with no choice after a High Court judge
ruled that Alan Williamson, jailed for six years in 1988 for attempted
rape, cannot be detained against his will without there first being a
special court order. And that could take weeks to obtain.
Mr Justice Tucker said the problem arose after the patient's nearest
relative, his father George, from Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, refused
to co-operate with doctors over his son's continued detention in a
secure unit at Winterton Hospital, Sedgefield, near Stockton.
Cleveland County Council's social services department failed last year
to start in time special county court procedures. These would have
enabled the authority to take over the role of ''nearest relative'' in
order to keep the 36-year-old patient in hospital.
Approved social worker Megan Wilson obtained a 28-day detention order
as a ''stop-gap'' until the county court application went through.
But it was the second ''assessment'' order of its kind, and such
''back-to-back'' orders were not legally valid, the judge ruled.
He said: ''I wish to make it plain that I do not impute any improper
motives either to Miss Wilson or to the managers. They found themselves
in a difficult situation where they were not receiving co-operation from
the nearest relative, and while they were anxious not to release into
the community a patient who might be a danger to himself and to
others.''
The judge said he hoped the application to get a ''nearest relative''
order ''will be speedily resolved''.
Later, Len Wilson, chief executive of South-west Durham Mental Health
Trust, said Mr Williamson had been told he was free to go home.
Mr Wilson said: ''We acted in accordance with today's judgment, which
was quite clear, and made Mr Williamson aware of his legal rights.
''As a consequence he decided he wished to go home, and he has every
right to.''
Asked about the risk the patient might pose to the community, Mr
Wilson said: ''I cannot comment on his clinical condition.''
David Behan, Cleveland's director of social services, said:
''Obviously we are deeply concerned that the practical effect of today's
decision is that currently neither us nor the hospital authorities can
require this person to reamin in hospital -- although we are convinced
that this is where he should be in the light of available medical
evidence.''
Mr Justice Tucker allowed Mr Williamson's application for judicial
review against social service moves to continue detaining him.
The judge described how, after he was jailed for attempted rape, Mr
Williamson was transferred to a secure ward at Winterton, then to a
secure unit at St Luke's, Middlesbrough.
He was discharged in 1992, but re-admitted to hospital as an informal
patient in February 1994. He discharged himself last August, but was
re-admitted within a short time.
When he again tried to leave last October, doctors considered the move
''inappropriate'' and detained him under section five of the Mental
Health Act.
His father did not consider that he required compulsory admission and
refused to discuss the matter, said the judge.
After obtaining reports, social services applied to have him admitted
''for assessment'' for a permitted maximum of 28 days under section two
of the Mental Health Act, a decision upheld by the Mental Health Review
Tribunal.
A consultant forensic psychiatrist recommended that Mr Williamson
remain in hospital ''for treatment'' as an informal patient, but that
could only happen with his consent, said the judge.
The consultant suggested that, if he would not agree, Mr Williamson
should be compulsorily detained ''as a last resort'' under section three
of the Act. But the problem was that Mr Williamson's father objected and
was able legally, as nearest relative, to block the move.
Because of the serious risk he posed, Mr Williamson had been
transferred from an open ward at North Tees hospital to a locked ward at
Winterton.
Social services had now asked the county court to direct that the
functions of nearest relative should be exercised by another person.
''The doctors considered he was too dangerous to be released into the
community, but the applicant was not willing to be detained,'' said the
judge.

EQUIPMENT which will bring an efficient electrical supply to the
Bolivian capital of La Paz will be shipped from Aberdeen today by the
John Wood Group, which has been awarded the #13.5m turnkey project.
La Paz, with a population of around one million, is the world's
highest capital city and the mobile power units will be sited at 4050
metres (13,300 ft) making them the highest operating land-based gas
turbines in the world.
The gas powered system will provide an uninterrupted supply and will
also bring electricity to the Kenco region around La Paz for the first
time.
''Our ability in the field of providing mobile power generation units
is already well proven and the contract follows hard on the heels of
recent successes in Nigeria, Greece and Papua New Guinea,'' said Mr Tom
Motherwell, Wood Group gas turbines divisional director.
''From the date of the original letter of intent to handover of the
commissioned power station is targeted to take five months. Given that
this involves the refurbishment and transportation of more than 250 tons
of hardware from Europe via the Panama Canal to Chile and then over the
Andes to Bolivia it is no mean feat.''

<TEXT>
A BRITISH lawyer has been indicted on charges of illegally concealing
evidence related to the investigation into the collapse of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, prosecutors said in New York. They
are seeking his extradition from Britain.
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said that David Sandy, a
partner of London law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons, was charged with two
felony counts of tampering with evidence and a misdemeanor count of
conspiracy for allegedly trying to keep evidence from a grand jury
investigating the conduct of BCCI.
A spokeswoman at Simmons &amp; Simmons in London said yesterday that all
its partners, including Mr Sandy, declined to comment.
The indictment issued yesterday alleged that Mr Sandy illegally
concealed computer-disk and printed versions of the business diary of
Zafar Iqbal, the chief executive of the disgraced BCCI when it was
closed down in 1991, prosecutors said in a statement.
The indictment said six other people took part in the conspiracy, but
none of them was being charged.
Mr Morgenthau said that Mr Sandy, 40, so far had declined to appear
voluntarily in New York for arraignment and his extradition was being
sought.
In his diary, Mr Iqbal summarised conversations and transactions with
BCCI officials and auditors, information that was important to the
investigation into the bank, Mr Morgenthau said.
Before BCCI was closed down in July 1991 amid claims of the largest
bank swindle in history, it had operations in 70 countries, with major
centres in London, Abu Dhabi and the Caribbean banking haven of the
Cayman Islands.
The bank has been accused of huge fraud, drug-money laundering,
bribing high officials and illegally acquiring US banks. Losses to
depositors and creditors have been estimated at $10bn (#6300m).
The felony charges each carry a maximum prison term of up to four
years.
Mr Sandy's law firm represented BCCI's majority shareholders,
including members of the royal family of the United Arab Emirate of Abu
Dhabi and agencies of the Abu Dhabi government, Mr Morgenthau said.
The shareholders have said they were unaware of the allegations
concerning Mr Sandy. The Washington-based firm of Patton Boggs &amp; Blow
has also claimed it was unaware of them and alerted authorities when it
learned of alleged misconduct

AN animal welfare centre was unveiled by the Scottish Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals yesterday in Milton, Dunbartonshire, by
the charity's former director Colin Fleming.
Built on the site of its original centre at a cost of #800,000, the
centre is expected to admit around 3000 animals each year. It can
accommodate 43 dogs and more than 50 cats.
There was no mention of pigs, which might be just as well considering
events on Tuesday on a South African Airways flight from Heathrow.
It was revealed that a cargo of flatulent flying pigs triggered fire
alarms and forced an airliner into an emergency landing. More than 300
people were on the aircraft, several hours in to its flight, when the
gas from the 72 pigs sparked the mid-air crisis.
As the automatic fire extinguishing system came on, the pilot turned
back. The aircraft landed safely at Heathrow.
Fifteen of the prize stud pigs died of asphyxiation when halon gas was
released in the hold as part of the fire-fighting systems.

SCOTLAND'S only senior amateur club, Queen's Park, will be presented
with a very professional #5m from the Football Trust tomorrow before the
Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final between Airdrie and Hearts at Hampden
as the latest contribution towards the development of the national
stadium.
The cheque, which will bring the Trust's assistance to the SFA and the
club up to #10m, will give the National Stadium Committee a lift towards
the #18m project to complete their plans to make the stadium one of the
most inviting in Europe.
The original #5m awarded by the Trust, which is funded by the pools
companies, was part of the #12m that was used to bring the stadium up to
its current status. That was made up of the Trust's money, #3.5m from
the Government, and #3.5m from the SFA.
The new money will be used to finance the refurbishment of the South
Stand, the last area of the ground which can be considered past its
best. It also is the most popular and traditionally most exclusive
seating section in the stadium but, because it was at least serviceable,
had to be left to the end of the queue for modernisation.
Queen's Park and the SFA will be particularly grateful for the Trust
contribution in light of the problems the pools companies have been
suffering as a result of the competition from the National Lottery.
Former referee Tom Wharton, deputy chairman of the Football Trust, has
been instrumental in seeing that Scottish football has been given its
fair share of the pools cash. Wharton, known as ''Tiny,'' is also
chairman of the SFA Referees Supervisors Committee.

TODAY we'll try something different, said the man in the natty checked
sports jacket, we'll put questions to your answers.
As a one-liner maybe it wasn't quite in the Chic Murray mould, but it
served as a passable opener designed to defuse a tricky situation.
Duncan Paterson, Scotland's team manager, was at Murrayfield to
announce the composition of the Scottish squad for the Rugby World Cup
in South Africa.
The problem was that the squad details had been faxed to the media 20
hours earlier. Human error was the explanation and all was forgiven.
In any event, at Murrayfield yesterday there was no sign of the
culprit swinging either from the yardarm, or the famous stadium's
goalposts.
Paterson added flesh to the bones of Wednesday's errant fax. He
declared that he would have been happier if they had been able to choose
a 30-strong squad.
''I am surprised that we have all been limited to 26 players,'' said
Paterson. ''With all the money that the World Cup will generate I would
have thought that 30 players would have been better.''
The manager declared that Andy Nicol, who is A N Other bracketed in
the scrum-half berth alongside Bryan Redpath, has at most three weeks to
prove his fitness, otherwise Derrick Patterson comes into the reckoning.
Nicol has been out of the game for 11 months following a knee injury
almost cost him his rugby career.
Paterson added that he had spoken to Derrick Patterson and explained
why he was not in the first draft alongside Redpath.
The only alteration to yesterday's team-sheet as opposed to that sent
out on Wednesday was that the backs and forwards were listed without
reference to specific positions.
On Wednesday, Tony Stanger was listed on the wing. However, the
35-times capped Hawick player, who made it known that he wished to be
considered only in the centre, was confirmed yesterday as first and
foremost, a centre who could play on the wing if required.
Similarly, Kenny Logan was listed as a wing who could deputise at full
back if the necessity arose and, although Eric Peters was the sole No.8,
Rob Wainwright and Doddie Weir could be drafted into that slot if
necessary.
Yesterday, Stanger said: ''I'm more than happy with the selection.
This is what I have been working towards all season.
''My goal was to get in the World Cup party as a centre and then to be
allowed to prove that I can do the job.
''There are still those who think I have made a mistake but I hope I
can prove the doubters wrong.''

A PENSIONER died after a doctor's bad handwriting led to him being
given the wrong drug, an inquest heard yesterday.
The medicine ''destroyed'' Desmond Haynes, 69, affecting his immune
system and making him drop in weight from 15 stones to a wizened figure
within two weeks.
A retired factory foreman, Mr Haynes was admitted to the Bensham
Hospital in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in December suffering from a chest
infection.
Just before Christmas a senior house doctor prescribed the drug
Thyroxine used in thyroid gland treatment. But pharmacist Ian Mackey
misread the prescription and dispensed the cancer and arthritis drug,
Methotrexate, from his pharmacy at the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
After nine days on the drug his condition severely worsened and he
died in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on December 30.
Consultant physician at the Queen Elizabeth Gareth Williams told the
hearing the writing on the prescription was ''not the easiest to read
that I have seen''.
Pharmacist Mr Mackey, who was working part-time at the dispensary when
he gave out the wrong drugs, said the department had been very busy at
the time as patients were being discharged for Christmas.
Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner William Duffy said:
''No one is perfect and in certain circumstances mistakes can occur and
in that respect I am understanding.''
But Mr Haynes's son, Alan, 45, said: ''I don't think they can dismiss
my father's death because it was Christmas.''
He said his family were taking legal action against the Gateshead
Hospital Trust.
The doctor who wrote the prescription, Dr Jose Miralles, insisted his
handwriting was ''perfectly legible'', in a statement issued through the
British Medical Association.

EDINBURGH College of Art is facing the wrath of local residents over
its plans to sell off a piece of land for a housing development at a
price of #400,000.
One of the main concerns is over traffic problems in a nearby lane
used by, among others, The Gateway Exchange set up by Jimmy Boyle.
Locals are angry that the site in Inverleith near the Royal Botanic
Gardens is being advertised as potentially suitable for eight flats at
the front of the site and three mews flats at the rear.
Mr Alexander McIntosh, who lives at the back of the site in Inverleith
Place Lane, said: ''I do not feel the lane can take more traffic. At
present the bin-lorry gets the house shaking when it goes along there.
More cars on the way to any mews flats would create even more
problems.''
The Inverleith Society -- a local amenity group -- said there had been
concerns in terms of traffic congestion and the style of any new housing
development.
A spokeswoman for The Edinburgh School of Art said it had not been
made aware of local concerns.

ONLY two players, Jack Nicklaus and Nick Faldo have successfully
defended the Masters Tournament, but in the first round of the
fifty-ninth in the series at the Augusta National Club yesterday, Jose
Maria Olazabal sent a pointed message to all his potential challengers
that his first major title would not easily be wrested from him.
Coming home in 31 for a score of 66, six under par, his lowest score
in 29 rounds in the tournament, Olazabal shared the lead at the end of a
drab and damp day with Phil Mickelson, the outstanding left-hander for
many a year, and the South African David Frost. The identity of the
three players a stroke behind them held equal intrigue.
Jack Nicklaus, helped by an eagle 2 at the 435-yard fifth, was on 67
with another American, Corey Pavin, and David Gilford, in character one
of the least assertive professionals in captivity but at 29 a member of
the European establishment who should have played in more than one Ryder
Cup match.
Mark O'Meara, a winner only last month, carried that form forward for
a 68, a figure also returned by Chip Beck.
Ian Woosnam, the winner four years ago and one of the few notable
names to start before noon as the bottom of the deck was heavily stacked
for television's convenience, supported the European challenge with a
69, Faldo was on 70, and Bernhard Langer, also twice a winner, and Colin
Montgomerie, were a stroke further behind along with the Spaniard,
Miguel Angel Jimenez.
Olazabal's decision to make practising his chipping and putting his
priority as he prepared for his defence was certainly handsomely
rewarded. In a round from which he excluded a bogey he made four birdies
and an eagle and his short game was critical in achieving them.
Using his No.7 iron, Olazabal twice chipped in on that inward half --
from 30 feet for a 2 at the short twelfth and from 25 feet at the long
fifteenth for a 3, which, by coincidence, he also memorably made last
year in the final round.
Inevitably, lower scoring was made more accessible by the rain which
fell overnight and continued sporadically throughout a windless day. The
6925-yard course played more truly to its length than in practice and
the greens, although still alarmingly quick from the wrong side of the
hole, were more receptive.
Mickelson, at 24, is the youngest player to have won five times on the
US Tour since Nicklaus, then a year younger, did so in 1963 -- and his
fifth victory also was the first of a record six in this tournament. Of
course, Mickelson is the most talented left-hander to emerge since the
New Zealander, Bob Charles, the only one to win a major title.
Mickelson, in reducing the lowest score by a ''wrong way round
golfer'' his own 69, by three strokes, now has every chance of beating
the best placing by a left-hander in the Masters, fifteenth. But for
driving into a bunker at the last for only his second bogey amid six
birdies and an eagle 3 at the thirteenth, Mickelson would have led on
his own.
Frost aged 35, has won nine events on the US Tour, but his highest
placing here was eighth in 1988, in the second of his seven appearances.
Like Olazabal he also succeeded in negotiating the course's bucking and
heaving terrain without dropping a stroke to the card.
Nicklaus only two years ago shared the first-round lead on 67 with
another former winner, Larry Mize. Neither could last the pace set by
Langer, the eventual winner, but as he showed when he gained his eighth
victory on the senior tour last week the art of winning has not deserted
Nicklaus in the autumn of his career.
Although he was disappointed at having covered the four long holes
cumulatively only in level par, Nicklaus was home in 32, having had four
birdies in six holes from the turn. But he reserved his single most
spectacular and rewarding shot for the fifth, where he holed, full toss,
a No.5 iron shot of 180-yards, his twentieth eagle in 37 successive
appearances in this event.
Gilford's golf is much less diffident than its owner's manner, as he
showed by the resourceful way in which he won last year's European Open
against a strong field on a demanding course. ''Not really,'' was his
quiet response to a questioner who asked if he was surprised to be so
high on the leaderboard.
But, in fact, this is Gilford's first Masters and only his fourth
experience of a major championship in the United States. Yet he adapted
his game readily to this, for him, unique challenge, with six birdies,
three of them in succession from the thirteenth after he had dropped his
only stroke by three-putting the eleventh.
Pavin, regarded as being one of America's strongest candidates to win
what would be his first major title, threw down the gauntlet with the
day's liveliest start, three birdies in the first four holes.
In equally his best previous start in 1992, Woosnam, who until near
the end swung the club with reassuring authority, made birdies three of
the four long holes. But as though unwilling to allow him to escape at
least some retribution, the long fifteenth, where he underclubbed into
the water, punished him.
Still not everyone prospered all the time. Sandy Lyle and Severiano
Ballesteros (out in 40), both former winners, finished on 75. Ernie Els,
the US Open Champion, also out in 40, rescued his reputation with 32
home as for his 69, as did Davis Love, determined not to waste his
eleventh hour qualification by winning at New Orleans on Sunday.
It looked as if Montgomerie would lay the bogy of his inability to
break 70 in the tournament when he turned in 33 and was still three
under par with two to play. But he bogeyed the last two holes and 71 was
the anti-climax.
As for Lyle he condemned himself with a thoroughly ragged start, three
over after only four holes.

THE man acquitted last year of murdering model Rachel Nickell, pulled
an axe during a fight on Wimbledon Common after being forced into a
world of unreality, a court was told yesterday.
Mr Colin Stagg, 31, an unemployed labourer, was convinced somebody was
after him in the wake of the not guilty verdict being ordered by an Old
Bailey judge, his solicitor Mr Ian Ryan told Wimbledon magistrates.
Mr Stagg had been hounded by journalists and received a string of
threatening letters and telephone calls.
Under those circumstances, he decided to arm himself with an axe for
self-protection and gave a cosh to his fiancee Ms Diane Beddoes, which
they carried when they went onto the common.
Mr Mark Dennis, prosecuting, said on Sunday, January 22 this year, Mr
Stagg, of Roehampton, south-west London, and Ms Beddoes, 26, who lives
with him, were walking on the common when they passed Mr Jamie Roberts
and his 11-year-old son without incident, but then Mr Roberts looked
back to call his two dogs which had stopped next to Mr Stagg.
Mr Stagg promptly went to Mr Roberts, pulled out the axe, and a fight
ensued, in which Mr Stagg ended up on the ground and Ms Beddoes, who had
joined the fight with her cosh, was pushed into a pond.
After passers-by intervened, Mr Stagg threw the axe, which had his
name and address carved into the handle, into the water. The court was
told the pair were arrested shortly afterwards by police.
Initially, they were charged with affray, assault, and possession of
the weapons and appeared in court yesterday for their case to be
committed to the Crown Court if magistrates felt it warranted.
However, after discussions between defence and prosecution lawyers and
legal submission to the court, the affray and the assault charges were
dropped.
The couple then pleaded guilty to possession of the weapons, with Mr
Stagg also admitting a new charge of threatening behaviour.
Magistrate Bernard Doswell adjourned the case until May 4 for
pre-sentence reports and granted both unconditional bail.

* THE rules committee defused a controversy that could have
disqualified Chip Beck by ruling he had not used a compass to help judge
wind direction during the first round. Beck, who shot a four-under-par
68, had prompted a stir when he declared: ''My caddie really helped me,
because he judged the wind properly. He knew from his compass where the
wind was coming.''
Will Nicholson, chairman of the rules committee, accepted the
explanation by Beck and caddie Greg Rita that a compass was used to
chart directions only during practice. Use of a compass in competition
is considered a breach of Rule 14-3, which prohibits using artificial
devices and unusual equipment. Such an infraction would lead to
disqualification.

A YOUTH who stabbed a boy to death in an apparently motiveless attack
was yesterday ordered to be detained without limit of time.
Stuart Swan, 17, plunged an 8-inch sheath knife into 15-year-old Paul
Stronner's chest and thigh. He died despite a six-hour operation.
At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, Swan, of Kinghorne Road,
Dundee, was found guilty of Paul's murder in Sandeman Street, Dundee, on
December 3 last year.
Two other 17-year-olds, Stewart Murray, of Tullideph Road, and Keith
Mathieson, of Strathmartine Road, were found guilty of culpable homicide
and each sentenced to five years in a young offenders' institution.
Gary Christie, 17, of Lintrathen Gardens, Dundee, who earlier admitted
assaulting Paul, of Lorimer Street, Dundee, by punching and kicking him
was given six months' detention, backdated to December 5.
A fifth youth, William Meach, 17, was freed on Wednesday when the
Crown dropped the murder charge against him.
The court heard that none of the four involved in the incident which
ended in Paul's death had been in trouble before and all came from
stable backgrounds.
Relatives sobbed as Lord Sutherland told Swan he would be detained
without limit of time. He told Murray and Mathieson it was a stupid and
extremely cowardly attack which got out of hand but he took into account
the fact that neither had a knife.
Nevertheless, they were there, a knife was used by Swan, and they had
persisted in the attack.
During the trial, the jury heard no evidence to link the dead youth to
his killer.
Paul, who had been in care and was living rough in a squat, happened
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time as a number of teenagers
rampaged through the area slashing tyres and generally looking for
trouble.
The build-up to the incident was the unconnected theft of a mountain
bike owned by Paul's friend, Andrew McCrudden, 17, who saw two youths
escaping with the bike and caught one of them.
As he and Paul cycled away, they were confronted by an angry teenage
gang.
Swan hauled Paul off the back of the bike and seconds later the
terrified 15-year-old found himself in the middle of a half-circle of
youths being punched and kicked.
Swan pulled a knife and plunged it into Paul's chest and thigh.
The court heard that if the wound to the thigh -- it severed a main
artery -- had been one centimetre on either side, Paul would have
survived.
However, Lord Sutherland told the jury yesterday that equally if the
knife which entered Paul's chest piercing his liver had gone another
centimetre deeper, he would have died.

THERE are times when each of us in football, from players through to
officials and, it has to be said, commentators, are inclined to get
carried off on the wings of hyperbole, using words that are far more
appropriate for the real excesses in life than the emotions engendered
by a ball game.
That was brought back home this week by the temperate observations of
one manager, Tommy Burns, when he was discussing the prospects of Celtic
winning their Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final tie against Hibs tonight.
The general view inside the perimeters of the football world is that
this is make-or-break time (there we go again) for the Parkhead club,
considering that they have not won a trophy for six years, and the
memory of the defeat in the Coca-Cola Cup final by Raith Rovers remains
etched in the minds of all who have Celtic leanings, not to mention many
who have precisely the opposite.
It is not surprising, therefore, that Burns is presented with a
prospect of failure which, the grapevine suggests, would be disastrous
(I know, that's another one) for the club.
No-one can appreciate more than Burns what the consequences of going
out at the penultimate stage of their last chance to prevent yet another
trophy-less season will mean. After all, it is his own first season and
he would not be human if he had not imagined he might just be fortunate
enough to change the pattern that has been Celtic's woeful lot for so
long.
Yet the manager was the one who chose temperate language, who refused
to indulge in the kind of hype that often prevails in such situations in
football, and only serves to heighten tension, exert intolerable
pressures on both teams and inevitably brings with it a disappointment
far greater than the loss of any football match warrants.
''I don't think it will be the be-all and end-all if we don't get to
the final,'' said Tommy. ''Life has to go on, whatever happens. People
said it was the end when we lost to Raith Rovers and maybe it felt like
it, but we have gone on since then.
''You can only do your best. Fate decides the rest.''
Those are not the kind of sentences you would normally expect from a
man leading his team into the most important game of their season, and
some might see them as far too civilised for the task he faces.
The fact that Burns, who is as dedicated and obsessed with the game
and his club as any of his peers, is still able to take a rational
perspective is encouraging for the long-term future of him and Celtic.
If the club succeed there will be no-one in the country with a broader
smile, and if they lose there will be no-one among the Celtic supporters
suffering a greater let-down, but Celtic will survive either way, as
will Burns.
It may not be perverse to say that the kind of self-inflicted pressure
which successive managers at Parkhead have endured, might have helped
perpetuate the lean times. A more detached, less intense approach when
required could be very useful for Burns as he attempts to restore a club
that has been enveloped in mediocrity for such a long time.
More than that, his deliberate attempt at reducing the excessive
demands that having to win a trophy puts on players, sounds to me like
wise counsel in advance of a big cup-tie.
It also is a reminder for all of us that Bill Shankly's immortal
remark that ''football is more important than life and death'' was
nothing more than a wonderful piece of Shanks nonsense.
* IF these have been different times for Celtic, they are not alone.
Bayern Munich, the biggest of all the big names in the Bundesliga, have
been having relatively lean times, too, although their presence in the
semi-final of the Champions' Cup suggests they are on the way back.
Yet the Dutch observers who watched Ajax draw 0-0 with Bayern in the
Olympic Stadium on Wednesday in the first leg of the semi-final,
apparently were amazed to see the mighty Germans adopting an
ultra-defensive policy in their home leg.
''They hardly crossed the halfway line,'' said one disappointed
traveller.
Bayern have been beset by injuries which no doubt contributed to their
caution, but it is still a strange day, indeed, when this multi-million
pound club has to play it safe at home, albeit against a Dutch side that
seems to be getting better and better, as well as younger and younger.
Still on Europe, the point I was making recently about the astonishing
commitment to live televised football by Scots was confirmed on
Wednesday when Scottish, who again were the only station in the UK to
take the European Champions' Cup match, this time between AC Milan and
Paris St Germain, discovered that they had reached a 52% audience
penetration in the central belt.

PARIS: Four Britons skiied naked down a mountain in the French Alps
for a wager and met with a frosty reception from police. The four skiied
down the busiest run in the Valloires resort from 9900ft earlier this
week, police said yesterday. Police said the unnamed Britons, who have
seasonal jobs in the resort, would appear in court on indecent exposure
charges.

MANILA: Troops prepared yesterday for a major offensive against Muslim
rebels holding 26 hostages seized in a deadly raid on a Philippine town
in which foreign extremists may have taken part. Interior Minister
Rafael Alunan said captured extremists and captured video had previously
revealed that foreigners were involved in training Muslim rebels.

BONN: United Nations climate conference negotiators edged forward on
one key pollution directive yesterday but left themselves several giant
leaps to make before the meeting's close today.
During its first nine days, the conference, a follow-on from the 1992
Rio Earth Summit, has made almost no progress towards a framework accord
to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases after the year 2000.
But UN spokesman Michael Williams said negotiators had reached broad
agreement on a scheme allowing rich countries to offset some of their
carbon dioxide reduction commitments by helping poorer nations cut their
emissions.

TWEEDBANK'S Joyce Lindores stepped up her bid to give Scotland a
fourth successive win in the Churchill Insurance women's world indoor
championship in Cumbernauld yesterday when she eased through to this
morning's semi-finals with a 3-1 win over Jersey's Val Stead.
Lindores won 7-0, 0-7, 7-0, 7-3 to set up a clash with Welsh
international Julie Davies.
''I'm reasonably happy with the way I've been playing this week and I
only hope I can continue it through tomorrow's last day,'' said
Lindores.
Davies held off a spirited fightback from former winner Mary Price to
join Lindores in the semi-finals. Davies took the opening set 7-6 and
the second 7-5 against the 1991 champion.
Price, who also reached the final in 1992 and again last year, needed
just three ends to take the third set 7-0 and then added the next 7-4 to
force a decider. Price opened with a three on the opening end of the
decider, but Davies then rallied and recovered to take the set 7-4 and
the match.
Ireland's Margaret Johnston is the only former winner through to the
last four. Johnston, the winner in 1988 and again the following year,
beat New Zealand's Marlene Castle, 7-1, 3-7, 7-2, 7-2.
Johnston's semi-final opponent will be Guernsey's Anne Simon, who
reached this stage for the second successive year when she beat
Belfast's Pat Smyth 7-3, 5-7, 7-4, 7-3.

Luxmbourg, Thursday
BRITAIN stood alone in Europe again tonight by refusing to condemn the
Canadians for taking the law into their own hands in the escalating
North Atlantic halibut war with Spain.
After a day of bitter exchanges in the Council of Ministers, European
Union fisheries politicians were unable to agree even a simple text
giving their views on the month-long dispute off Newfoundland.
Fisheries Minister Michael Jack and Sir Hector Monro, from the
Scottish Office, refused point blank to put Britain's name to a
Spanish-inspired resolution seeking to condemn Ottawa and deplore the
latest Canadian unilateral action in protection of fish stocks in the
disputed Grand Banks.
As Britain stood back, the French -- who chaired the tense meeting as
holders of the rotating EU presidency -- issued a communique in their
own name instead of the council as a whole.
It contained the words objected to by Britain -- but it was clear that
while the UK was isolated on yet another European issue, the two British
ministers had some support from others, including the Irish and the
Swedes.
Mr Jack emerged from the talks looking tired but defiant. He said
coldly: ''It became apparent the council would not make this statement .
. . these words are the words of the presidency.''
When agreement was seen to be impossible, the discussion was abandoned
against a background of fresh incidents between Canadian patrols and
Spanish trawlers. This new action prompted Spain to attack Canadian
''aggression''.
As ministers were meeting in Luxembourg, EU and Canadian officials
were gathered in Brussels to negotiate a new formula for resolving the
dispute. If an outline deal is struck, it will probably go before a
council of EU foreign ministers -- the most senior decision-making level
after a summit -- next week.
Mr Jack brushed aside calls for condemnation of Canada and insisted:
''It is our view that any further action by the EU should concentrate on
bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion. In our view, the
statement proposed by the council was not helpful in this respect. It
would have been counter-productive and made it more difficult to find
common ground on outstanding issues.''
The furious Spanish, indignant at the Canadians allegedly provoking
new tensions in international waters off Newfoundland, pressed for a
united front by the EU but did not find it as Britain split the
Community by again invoking its Commonwealth ties with Canada.
Mr Hugh Coveney, the Irish minister, went along with British calls for
less talk of tough action against Canada and more effort ''to avoid
violent confrontation or threats''.
He backed the Canadian stance on conservation and management of stocks
but not Canada's seizure at gunpoint of the freezer boat Estai last
month -- an act denounced by the European Commission as piracy.
Mr Coveney said Ireland backed the EU's criticism of Canada. ''But I
have to say it has not been a popular line in Ireland, given our close
historic ties with Newfoundland where a significant ethnic Irish
population exists, much of it amongst the fishing communities there.''
Spain accused Canada of using patrols to try to board a Spanish
trawler and cut the nets of two others in the disputed grounds early
today.
Mr Brian Tobin, Canada's fisheries minister, responded: ''The reality
is that no such order was given nor was any such attempt made either to
cut a net or to board a vessel.''
The Spanish fishermen claimed one boat had its nets cut. The EU
countered by suggesting the nets had been fouled by the trawler's own
propeller and lost during moments of confusion caused by Canadian
harassment.
Canada called in ambassadors from the EU, Germany, Britain and Spain
to protest at what it called false European allegations of
Canadian-inspired harassment.
As the dispute escalated again, thousands of angry Spanish fishermen
massed outside the Canadian embassy in Madrid and pelted the building
with eggs and dead fish. ''We are up against a government of
delinquents. The Canadians are the pirates of the oceans in the 21st
century,'' said Mr Enrique Davila, captain of the Estai.
The Spanish today published copies of the inspection report issued
after the Estai was examined by the Canadian authorities in January
before it was arrested in March.
The papers purport to show that the Canadians were satisfied that the
Estai's net -- cut by the skipper when challenged by a patrol boat
before being recovered by the Canadian authorities -- were of legal
size.

Kigali, Thursday
RWANDA'S genocide trials began today with a defendant admitting he
killed 900 people in the holocaust that began exactly 12 months ago.
The trial was later adjourned indefinitely because none of the
prosecution witnesses was present.
Looking frightened and dressed in pink prison T-shirts and shorts, the
first seven of up to 30,000 jailed suspects appeared in a magistrates'
court in the capital Kigali.
They were accused of taking part in the genocide of up to a million
Tutsis and allied Hutus between last April and June.
''I am going to be accused of genocide. It is true, I killed 900
people and I expect to be executed,'' Musoro Ndura said as he was led
into the dock.
Presiding judge Claudien Gatere declared the trial adjourned until
further notice because witnesses had failed to turn up.
A large crowd, mainly Tutsis bereaved in the slaughter by hardline
Hutus, packed the streets around the court as the defendants drove up in
a pick-up truck under tight security.
The first in the dock was Ngomayubu Nkulikingoma, a 17-year-old
accused of the genocide of 12 people in the commune of Butamwa on the
outskirts of the capital.
He pleaded not guilty and was represented by a Unicef (United Nations
Children's Fund) lawyer because he is a minor.
Other defendants just answered their names read out by state
prosecutor Silas Munyigashali. Those found guilty of genocide in Rwandan
courts could face the death penalty by firing squad.
An international tribunal, to try ringleaders who planned last year's
massacres, is due to start in Arusha, Tanzania, at the end of this year.
Its maximum penalty will be life imprisonment.
The trials in Rwanda began on the first anniversary of the
assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana.
His death triggered the start of the three-month bloodbath, and the
exodus of some two million Hutus into neighbouring Zaire, Tanzania and
Burundi.
Commemorations of the anniversary were held in many capitals around
Africa and in Europe.
But the ethnic enmity between Tutsis and Hutus infected even those
ceremonies with some recalling the genocide of Tutsis and others the
deaths of Habyarimana and the Hutu president of Burundi, Cyprien
Ntaryamira, who was killed with Habyarimana.
Prominent exiled Hutus in Kenya held a church service for their dead
leader. An alleged ''death list'' drawn up by Rwandan Hutus forced the
cancellation of meetings in Ivory Coast to commemorate the genocide.
The first in what could be a marathon series of trials began almost
seven hours late.
The official reason for the delay was that the prison vehicle
transporting the eight defendants -- one faced the lesser charge of
stealing state funds --  was broken.
But prison officials said privately they had been waiting for
high-level approval for the trials to proceed.
Political analysts in Kigali said the government, headed by Hutu
President Pasteur Bizimungu but backed by a Tutsi-dominated army,
appeared divided over the timing of the trials.
Pasteur was quoted on French television today as saying trials would
be orderly, not rushed.
''These people deserve to be executed publicly if they are found
guilty. After all, that is what they did to our families,'' 58-year-old
Francois Kayimba, shaking with fury, told Reuters as he stood outside
the court.
Critics said Rwanda was incapable of holding a free and fair trial but
the UN has welcomed the start of the trials.
''Either one waits a long time for a perfect, or near-perfect system,
or one accepts an imperfect system which is ready, start on that and try
and improve on it,'' UN special representative Shaharyar Khan said in
Kigali yesterday.--Reuter.

RICHARD Dunwoody is expected to return to the saddle this afternoon
with the help of pain-killing injections.
The champion jockey underwent treatment to a knee injury after having
been forced to give up riding two races into the opening day of the
Aintree meeting yesterday.
The pain threatened to disrupt Dunwoody's preparation for the mount on
Miinnehoma in tomorrow's Grand National. But after having undergone
x-rays at a Liverpool hospital, he said he hopes to fulfil his booking
for four rides today.
''I've had injections and an orthopaedic surgeon says it should be all
righ,'' said the rider.''
This afternoon, Welshman can make it third time lucky in the Oddbins
Hurdle at Aintree, writes White and Gold.
The nine-year-old seems to go well at this track. In 1992 he looked
the likely winner when Dean Gallagher sent him to the front five out,
only to be caught on the run-in.
The following year he was caught for speed in the closing stages, and
a set-back prevented his running after February last term and caused him
to miss last year's race.
Welshman has been dropped by the handicapper during his lay-off and he
threatened to take advantage at the first opportunity when he hit the
front at the second-last flight at Newcastle.
The day's feature race, the Mumm Melling Chase, offers a fascinating
clash between Champion Chase winner Viking Flagship and Martha's Son,
unbeaten over fences.
Viking Flagship meets Martha's Son on terms 19lb better than when he
was beaten more than 25 lengths by him at Ascot in January. Last month's
second straight Cheltenham victory showed Viking Flagship is in much
better heart now.
The strong run he put in from the second-last fence at Cheltenham
suggested that today's two-and-a-half-mile trip should hold no terrors
for him.

AN animal shot dead by a farmer who feared for his sheep, was a
fruit-eating lemur.
The monkey-like nocturnal creature, endangered in its native
Madagascar and worth #1000, was probably curious about the sheep, an
expert said yesterday.
It had escaped from its owner in Bala, North Wales, when spotted on
Wednesday night by a policeman near a flock off the A494
Bala-to-Llanuwchllyn road.
He threw a stick and stone at it before alerting farmer Mr Gwynfor
Williams, who went after it with his shotgun.
The animal was near some more sheep in a field when Mr Williams shot
it. It was 4ft from head to tail, had ruffed fur, a pointed nose, and
ape-like hands.
Later, Mr Williams said: ''I thought it looked quite vicious. When it
saw me, it bared its teeth . . . ''
However, Mr Michael Lockyear of Howlett's Zoo, Kent, said: ''Maybe it
was just curious -- it certainly wasn't looking at the sheep as food.''

HEARTS striker John Robertson yesterday set his sights on Airdrie and
tomorrow's Scottish Cup semi-final, saying: ''This could be my last
chance to be a winner.''
Robertson played in the Tynecastle side which lost 3-0 to Aberdeen in
the 1986 cup final. As a raw 21-year-old he expected big occasions to
come along every other season, but instead the Edinburgh club have
failed at the semi-final hurdle on four occasions since.
Tomorrow they face first division Airdrie, who themselves beat Hearts
at this stage three seasons ago on penalties after a replay, and
Robertson said: ''I can remember back in 1986 that I imagined I would
play in another four or five cup finals.
''The sad truth is that it hasn't happened. This is our sixth
semi-final in nine seasons and we've only been to that one cup final.
Myself and the other guys who were in the team then know that time is
running out. There might not be many more chances.
''We could end up as good club players who never won a thing and that
would be a huge disappointment. It's almost a decade since we were in a
final and that's not good enough for a club like Hearts.''
Craig Levein, Gary Mackay, Neil Berry and keeper Henry Smith are
others who featured in 1986.
Robertson has recovered from a knock suffered against Partick Thistle
on Tuesday night, which should mean him taking his usual place at
Hampden. Keeper Craig Nelson, whose mother is on Airdrie's commercial
staff, is also close to full fitness after a knee injury and should
replace veteran Smith.
Defender Dave McPherson is bidding for a third successive cup final
appearance after winning and losing with Rangers in 1993 and 1994
against Aberdeen and Dundee United respectively.
McPherson rejoined Hearts last October from Rangers and has been in
fine form since. ''People said it was a downward step for me when I left
Ibrox, but I didn't see it that way,'' he said.
''I knew almost everybody at Tynecastle, having only been away two
years, and that helped me settle in. I'd be very proud to end the season
on a high, but we know Airdrie are formidable opponents after that
semi-final defeat in 1992.''
Hearts have knocked out cup favourites Rangers and holders Dundee
United in their run this season, but McPherson warns the toughest test
could come tomorrow. He said: ''The semi is the hardest stage, I always
feel. If you are in the final you can enjoy the day, but you must get
there first.''
Manager Tommy McLean, a cup winner with Rangers as a player and in
1991 as manager of Motherwell, last night took his semi-final squad away
to a hotel to prepare.
After two premier division defeats, against Falkirk and Partick
Thistle, McLean is urging for no complacency at a club that has not won
the Scottish Cup since 1956.
''We've heard about how we are favourites, but we must show the right
application on the day,'' said McLean. ''We haven't done that in the
past two games and it just shows you can't switch on and switch off your
form in football.
''The longer term players here have had their disappointments, but
they have to learn from them. Nobody can change the semi-final record --
but it's what we do now that counts.''
McLean is hopeful that only long-term injury victim Stephen Frail will
be unavailable for selection when he decides on his line-up closer to
the kick-off.

Ankara, Thursday
TURKISH Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, resisting Western pressure to end
an 18-day-old military drive into Iraq, today vowed to pull out only
when rebel Kurds there stopped attacking Turkey.
''Until we reach this aim, it is impossible for us to pull out of the
region. We are going to reach this aim and withdraw,'' she told her
conservative True Path party.
Other cabinet ministers pleaded Turkey's case in Britain and the
United States, which like France and Germany have demanded a swift end
to the thrust by 35,000 Turkish troops against separatist rebels of the
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
the European Parliament, concerned for the fate of civilians in the
way of the incursion, urged European Union states to follow the example
of Germany which froze military aid shipments to Ankara in protest.
The bodies of the first Turkish civilians killed since the operation
began arrived from Iraq, military officials said.
The three aid workers were killed yesterday in a clash with an angry
crowd of Kurds going to collect the bodies of seven shepherds allegedly
killed by Turkish soldiers, Kurdish witnesses said.
Iraq called Turkey's military incursion into its northern areas to
flush out rebel Kurds an invasion and demanded that Ankara immediately
withdraw its troops.
Meanwhile, Turkey invited a northern Iraqi Kurdish leader today to
make a rare official visit to Ankara to discuss the future of the
region.--Reuter.

FILM showing the last displays of Davie Cooper's skills are expected
to be screened as a fitting tribute to the football legend.
The ex-Scotland international died suddenly from a brain haemorrhage
two weeks ago while filming a training programme for Scottish Television
at Broadwood, Cumbernauld.
With him was Celtic's Charlie Nicholas who will re-shoot the programme
with a different guest star each time.
Yesterday Cooper's parents, brother and fiancee said they had no
objection to a compilation of his last film being shown on TV.
A statement from parents Jock and Jean, brother John and Liz Thomson
said: ''It will be some months before the programme is shown. We
understand that STV want to show Davie's skills filmed just before he
died and we are happy with that to go ahead.''
The immediate family wanted to make it clear STV had shown them every
consideration in the programme arrangements.
The last shots of the ex-Rangers, Motherwell and Clydebank star are
expected to be brought together in the tenth programme of the series
sometime in the autumn.
A close friend of the family said last night: ''Some people are trying
to suggest that STV were being hard-hearted about this. That could not
be further from the truth.''

LABOUR yesterday accused the Government of twice breaching its own
laws over the #4000m sell-off of its stake in electricity generators
National Power and PowerGen.
Last month, the Government was accused of misleading more than a
million people who bought shares whose value fell after new controls on
electricity prices were signalled.
Ministers were attacked for failing to disclose before the sell-off a
dramatic U-turn on prices.
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Dr Jack Cunningham said yesterday
that he had received confirmation from the director-general of the
electricity supply, Professor Stephen Littlechild, that he informed the
Government he was considering a new round of price capping four days
ahead of flotation.
He said given that the Government was in receipt of price-sensitive
information ahead of the flotation, it was now clear it had breached at
least two pieces of its own legislation.
He said he had written to all Treasury Ministers asking them to
clarify exactly when they were informed about the price capping.

ABERDEEN chairman Ian Donald yesterday denied reports that he is ready
to sell his controlling interest in the relegation-threatened club to a
shipping tycoon for #3m.
Instead, Donald vowed to increase his shareholding when the club goes
public in the summer.
Donald insisted: ''This is the first I have heard of any take-over
bid, but I have no intention of selling out. I have said before that if
a genuine offer comes in I will be more than interested if it is for the
good of Aberdeen FC. So far this has not happened.
''There is no truth in this rumour. I will be chairman here for the
forseeable future. I will not be leaving.''
Aberdeen supporter Douglas Craig, managing director of a shipping
group involved in the North Sea oil business, was linked with the
take-over, but a spokesman for his firm said: ''This story is totally
without foundation.
''Douglas, who is on holiday, appeared at a supporters' rally and
someone's put two and two together and got 16.''
Meanwhile, caretaker manager Roy Aitken must pick up his team for the
tough league match against Rangers at Ibrox tomorrow. He said: ''We
cannot afford to let Partick Thistle get out our sights. We must start
picking up points.
''But there is no better place to do this than at Ibrox. We played
well to beat them up here when I took over and need a repeat of that
performance.
''For me, Rangers are the best team in the country and to get another
result against them would be a major boost at a vital time.
''If we maintain the recent improvement in our form and consistency we
will have a chance of doing this at Ibrox.''
Striker Scott Thomson has been ruled out after damaging an ankle in a
midweek reserve game.

Sarajevo, Thursday
TWO men were killed and at least four other people were wounded by a
mortar bomb attack on a Sarajevo suburb today, reporters on the scene
said.
UN officials confirmed four ''detonations'' and 10 bursts of heavy
machine-gun fire into the western suburb of Hrasnica, but gave no
details except to say the attack came from the Bosnian Serb side of the
line.
One of the dead was a soldier, Hasib Selilovic. Residents said he was
killed by a mortar bomb while standing at the main bus stop in Hrasnica.
A mortar bomb or artillery attack later wounded a boy and a woman in
central Sarajevo, UN and hospital sources said. Kosevo hospital admitted
a seven-year old boy and a 51-year-old woman with shrapnel injuries.
Captain Miriam Souchaki, a UN spokesman, confirmed three detonations
in the city centre tonight.
Souchaki also said two UN military observers were taken prisoner and
held blind-folded in a cellar by Bosnian Serb forces in Sarajevo for
reasons unknown. The two were later released.
A French soldier was wounded tonight by a rifle grenade near the
Jewish cemetery on the frontline dividing Serb forces and the Muslim-led
government army in Sarajevo.
Television footage shot in Hrasnica showed blood on the pavement, a
bus with shrapnel holes and broken windows and the impact of a mortar
bomb.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Police ready to counter expected demonstration at big race by animal rights activists.  Fireworks alert for Grand National</HEADLINE>

ANIMAL rights activists, armed with fireworks and flares, will make a
determined attempt to disrupt tomorrow's Grand National, police believe.
Undercover officers have spent months infiltrating the activist groups
to discover their latest tactics in a protest that has become a feature
of the world's greatest steeplechase.
The activists are expected to attempt to hurl fireworks and flares
from the crowd and try to handcuff themselves to fences in a bid to
spoil the spectacle, watched by millions of people around the world.
Last year, the huge security net at Aintree ensured a total victory
for the police, after demonstrations at the 1993 event contributed to
the double false start that wrecked the big race.
Arrests last year began on the Monday of race week. However, Chief
Superintendent Paul Burrell, in charge of policing Aintree, said no
arrests were made in the early part of this week.
''We have had no attempts at disruption so far, but we believe that
they are with us in the area today, probing our defences,'' he added.
Those defences are a further refinement of last year's major
operation, with quicker response times, better communications and more
thorough intelligence.
More than 200 police officers and security staff are involved in the
operation, which will be stepped up tomorrow.
They cannot physically search everyone in the huge crowds, so rely on
intelligence work to pinpoint the likely activists.
Spotlights and security cameras will guard every Grand National fence
around the clock until after the race.
Two external barriers, one of wire mesh, now enclose the course.
''People have referred to it as a ring of steel. I prefer to call it a
ring of confidence,'' Mr Burrell said.
Police are on the alert for possible attacks from the air, mindful of
the seizure last year of a model aircraft which they believe was
intended to buzz the horses and disrupt the race.
''I expect they will make some attempt to disrupt the event,'' Mr
Burrell said. ''The sort of thing we are looking towards is throwing
things like flares and fireworks from the crowd and perhaps handcuffing
themselves to fences.''
Officers will be prepared to act swiftly to deal with any attacks,
equipped with bolt cutters, metal detectors, fire extinguishers and
sand.
''We think we're ready for anything,'' Mr Burrell said.
The activists' tactics could be very dangerous for the horses, he
added.
''This makes you doubt if the people involved are genuine animal
activists, or if they have another motive such as disrupting a major
event for its own sake.
''There is nothing like the Grand National anywhere in the world, and
I love this job. It is a dreadful responsibility, but when it all goes
right it is a wonderful feeling,'' he said.

WHILE the lean medal harvest from last year's Commonwealth Games may
suggest otherwise, there are encouraging signs that grass roots
athletics in Scotland is beginning to flourish.
Motherwell District Athletic Club is now reaping the benefit of one of
Britain's boldest and most ambitious development programmes.
Three of the four teams qualifed from national competition to
represent Scotland on Sunday at the UK Sportshall Athletics final in
Birmingham are from the Motherwell club -- under-13 boys and girls, and
under-15 girls. The under-15 boys are from Perth and Kinross.
Apart from commercial backing from Lucozade, the local council has
invested #105,000 over three years.
Particularly unusual is that the under-13 teams are largely the
product of youngsters introduced to the sport through primary schools.
The Motherwell club's coaches co-ordinator, Phil McMahon, confirms: ''Of
the 52 primaries in the district, 34 are doing Sportshall -- perhaps 600
youngsters.''
McMahon, assistant head teacher at Cardinal Newman High School, helped
launch the programme with Tom Boyle, coach of Commonwealth 10,000m
champion Yvonne Murray and formerly of 800m international Tom McKean.
Murray's influence perhaps explains why more than 60% of the membership
is female.
Partnerships like that at Motherwell are being encouraged by the
Scottish Athletics Federation for whom development officer, Graham Ross,
the Sportshall programme is a personal triumph.
''In remote areas, like Orkney and Argyll, there is tremendous
interest. Clubs are struggling to cope.''
That is just one reason why SAF is hosting a seminar on May 6, at
Stirling University. ''Supporting and Developing Athletic Clubs'' is
geared towards the specific needs of club secretaries, treasurers,
chairmen and coaching resource organisers.
''The governing body has perhaps not done enough for clubs in the
past,'' admits Ross. ''The role of clubs is changing. Clubs should learn
from the past, but not live in it.''
Only 10% of Scotland's 200 clubs attended a recent development
conference designed to improve things. Absentees this time may pay a
high price. ''Those who attend will get priority for future courses and
resources,'' adds Ross. ''We can't microwave a quick fix for athletics,
but we can't afford to squander our resources either.''

TENANTS at a Scottish caravan site are being told to leave after a
television programme dubbed it ''Hell on wheels''.
Channel Four's Undercover Britain programme showed shots of raw sewage
being spread in the grounds of the Mundole caravan site near Forres,
Morayshire.
The programme also showed young children wading amongst the waste.
The owners of the park are now closing the rented residential business
and 70 people are being made homeless.
Thirty owner-occupiers and 50 holiday caravans will remain open at the
site.
Lawyers for the Riverview Leisure Company yesterday denied that living
conditions were as bad as portrayed on screen.
But company manager Steven Tinsley admitted the decision to close the
site was as a direct result of the television allegations.''
He added: ''We have had no support from the local authorities to
upgrade the facilities.''
Moray District Council is now expecting a flood of applications from
homeless residents and says it will do everything they can to help.
A spokesman strongly denied the council had failed to support the
caravan park.

EDINBURGH Racers coach Jock Hay looked forward to a British
Championship semi-final slot at Wembley and said: ''We've proved the
doubters wrong.'' His side qualified for the London trip on April 15
thanks to a rare 6-5 victory at Durham Wasps on Wednesday night.
It was Hay's first win at the Wearside rink as coach.
Defending champions Cardiff Devils also qualified from Group B and
they visit Racers tomorrow with the Edinburgh side travelling to
Basingstoke Beavers in their final play-off game on Sunday.
Injury-hit Fife Flyers have it all to do to join their Scottish
arch-rivals at Wembley. They are now in a dog-fight for a qualifying
slot after having lost 8-4 at Humberside Hawks on Wednesday.
Flyers travel to new premier division champions Sheffield Steelers
tomorrow and entertain Nottingham Panthers on Sunday in their Group A
final game. Four points are a must if they are to stand any chance of
qualifying.
The same goes for promotion-pushing Paisley Pirates, who have to sting
Bracknell Bees at The Lagoon on Saturday and shoot down Slough Jets in
England to earn a dream step-up.

PAUL Weir, who comfortably outpointed Renato ''Ric'' Magramo of the
Philippines in his home town of Irvine on Wednesday night to retain the
World Boxing Organisation light-flyweight championship, is ready to
travel in his search for boxing riches.
The 27-year-old, who is the only Scot ever to win world titles at two
different weights, has so far resisted the temptation of bigger money to
move outside Scotland.
His manager, Tommy Gilmour, revealed that Weir had turned down a huge
offer to fight in South Africa. ''If it had been left to me, I would
have taken the offer,'' said Gilmour. ''It's my job to do the best I can
for my boxers. It was, however, Paul's decision to make, and he chose to
fight in front of his own fans.''
That is about to change. Weir has ambitions to add the world flyweight
crown to the two titles already won and, in fact, had lined up a
challenge to WBO champion Baby Jake Matlala, of South Africa. Matlala,
however, lost the title to Mexico's Alberto Jiminez, but a Weir-Matlala
contest is still probable -- with the Scot's light-fly crown at stake.
Matlala, the man who ended Pat Clinton's world title reign, is a huge
draw in his native country and Weir is well known there, too. Now
negotiations are under way for the pair to meet in Sun City in late
summer or early autumn. If it comes off, the Scot will earn the biggest
pay packet of his life, something in the six-figure bracket.
There have been suggestions that Weir should go straight for the third
crown by meeting Jiminez, but the more sensible path would be to make
another defence of the light fly championship.
Weir, who boxed for most of Wednesday's fight with a damaged right
hand, said: ''I've always said I don't want to hang around in the game.
I'm looking to make a few bob and then maybe try and help bring on some
young boxers.''
Meantime, his top priority is getting the injury sorted out. Gilmour
said: ''The way he hit Magramo in the third round has caused damage,
worse than we first thought.'' Weir will have X-rays today, then see a
specialist.

STUDENTS have criticised an undercover police operation to catch
cannabis smokers in a Scots college.
Young plain clothes CID officers spent a day mingling with students at
Coatbridge College.
The police were called in by college principal Ian MacIver after he
received complaints about cannabis being smoked in the common rooms.
But engineering student Stuart Dobson, 22, said: ''I think it was a
bit suspect the way they went about it.
''I wasn't there at the time but I've been told they searched
everybody in the place.
''They need to catch people but I don't know if this is the way to do
it.''
One student, who wouldn't give his name, said: ''It was a bit heavy
handed. It seems a bit sneaky to go undercover and trap people. I mean,
most young people smoke hash now and again.''
And one student admitted she was in possession of cannabis on the day
of the raid, but was missed by police.
The girl said: ''I don't agree with the methods used by the police at
all.'' But other students praised detectives for the covert operation.
Ms Anne Green, 32, an office and administration student, said: ''There's
probably no other way of catching people who are involved with drugs.
''It's been going on for years, and so if they can crack down without
infringing on people's civil liberties then I think that's a good
thing.''
Following the operation, three students, one female and two males,
were charged with the possession of cannabis.

HOPEFUL junior doctors have flooded a hospital's paediatric department
with job applications, after national publicity about a looming crisis
in its children's ward.
Management at Stirling Royal Infirmary said yesterday that they did
not now expect to have to divert sick babies and children to other
hospitals this weekend as a result of a junior doctor's resignation in
protest at pay and workload.
Chief executive Alan Hunter said media coverage of Dr Bryan Connor's
decision to quit had led to a large number of suitably qualified medics
contacting the hospital looking for locum work, and a number of strong
applications.
''We expect we'll have a locum here this weekend, which will enable us
to provide the normal service,'' he said. ''It's not how I'd choose to
recruit staff but the publicity seems to have done the trick.''
Earlier yesterday, the hospital had issued a statement confirming that
unless the staffing gap was filled, it would begin sending children
referred by GPs to other hospitals at 5pm today, except where such
diversions were judged ''clinically inappropriate''.
Mr Hunter yesterday defended his own salary against attacks from the
Scotland Patients' Association. Its chief executive, Ms Margaret
Davidson, said the association was fully behind Dr Connor.
''All the money in the NHS seems to be going on administrators, rather
than on patient care,'' she said. ''The managers seem to expect young
doctors to work for next to nothing.''
Mr Hunter, 35, who joined the hospital 10 months ago, revealed that he
was currently earning #53,500 a year, #4500 less than his predecessor,
and that he worked up to the 72 hours a week maximum permitted for
junior doctors.
He said Dr Connor, 26, would have been on a salary range of #23,700 to
#30,100.
It was also revealed that Dr Connor had at one stage offered to do his
own job at the higher locum rates.

Nairobi, Thursday
A BRITISH racing yacht was rescued by a Canadian warship after pirates
opened fire on it off the coast of Somalia.
The #1.5m, 78ft Longo Barda was ambushed as she headed back to her
home port of Southampton.
The pirates machine-gunned the yacht, fired a mortar, and tried to get
aboard.
The only woman member of the crew of seven, Mary Ellis, was so scared
she locked herself in the yacht's toilet.
Skipper Neil Batt, of Lymington, Hampshire, put out a mayday call and
a passing tanker and the Canadian naval frigate Fredericton raced to the
rescue.
The pirates fled when they saw the warship and the yacht's crew
escaped unharmed.
The yacht's former first mate Chris Sherlock, 26, who spoke to the
crew by radio after yesterday's attack, said: ''They thought they were
going to die.''
Mr Sherlock, of Hamble, Hampshire, added: ''These pirates are
desperate people. They don't take prisoners.''
Mr Sherlock left the yacht when it was moored in Perth, Australia, on
March 2. It was heading home after taking part in the Sydney-Hobart race
with a crew of two Britons, four Australians and a New Zealander.--PA.

TOUCHE Ross Gordonians, threatened with relegation, produced their
best form of the season to beat MIM 1-0.
However, that success has done little for their prospects of survival,
but it has started off alarm bells at Western, Insights Inverleith, and
Edinburgh University -- just above them in the table -- and even at
leaders Grange.
The reason for Grange's concerned is that they meet the Aberdonians at
Cramond in a semi-final of the Scottish Cup.
Stuart Smith, the Grange manager, is not too concerned about the
prospect of facing Gordonians, for his side played well recently in
Germany, and some of the Gordonians' players could be short of fitness,
having turned out this week in the British Universities championship.
Their performances in the event have inspired their colleagues to some
outstanding displays which has won the Scots many admirers.
With Grange having had a rest since returning from Frankfurt,
including their two students, Calum Wood and Gary Boomer, they should go
on and take another step towards the league-and-cup double.
* INTEREST in the womens' league this weekend will be focused on the
relegation zone, with Grange and 2nd Western on duty at Hyndland and
Edinburgh Ladies.
With Ladies favourites to take the title, Western can expect no
favours. Indeed, Edinburgh just might see this as an opportunity to
boost their goal difference.
Claire Murphy, the Western keeper, will be bracing herself for a
bombardment, while Caryln Mitchell just might be tempted to take along
her knitting, because playing in front of her will be seven of the
Edinburgh Ladies contingent who will be wearing Scotland's colours in
the four nations' tournament in Rome over Easter.
At Gordonstoun and Kinross, Scotland will be host to England, Ireland,
and Wales in the annual four nations' tournament at under-18 and
under-16 levels.

THE SHETLAND sandeel fishery, closed in 1990 amid fears of
over-fishing, has recovered sufficiently to be reopened, the Scottish
Office announced yesterday.
The move was attacked immediately by the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, which claims that no safeguards have been set up to
protect seabirds nor to allow sustainable fishing.
Following consultation with international fisheries scientists,
fishermen and conservationists, the Agriculture and Fisheries Department
has decided that sandeel stocks stand at a sufficiently high level to
allow limited fishing to recommence.
These limits, which will apply for the next three years, have been set
in recognition of recent concerns over the importance of sandeel stocks
in the food chain for seabirds and other marine fauna.
The precautionary controls limit the annual take to 3000 tonnes, which
can be landed only at Lerwick.
In addition, the Shetland fishery will close on June 30 each year,
regardless of whether or not the catch limits have been reached.
Access to the fishing grounds also will be restricted to named vessels
of 20 metres or less in length holding a UK fishing licence who apply to
the Department.
The vast majority of these boats will be UK-based, although it is
understood that boats of other nationalities also can hold a UK licence.
Access to the West of Scotland fishery will be granted on a similar
restricted basis.
Only fishermen with a track record of harvesting the eelbeds will be
allowed to fish the grounds, which will close on July 31 next year.
The maximum take from these grounds has been set at 12 000 tonnes,
which can only be landed within the UK at Lerwick.
Landings can be made in the Faroe Isles if 24 hours' notice is given
to the fishery's Lerwick Office.
The new restrictions will make the Scottish inshore sandeel fisheries
''the most regulated in Europe'', the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department claimed yesterday.
It believes the limits will protect the sandeel stocks from
over-exploitation, but will reconsider the situation should an
assessment before next season prove these rules have been flouted.
The Department also will consider closing the fishery and some
sensitive sites should it be proved that fishermen are taking too many
young fish at the end of the season.
However, the RSPB yesterday was quick to claim the controls adopted
were not adequate to protect the seabird and fish population.
The most serious of its objections to the Scottish Office plans was
the failure to designate certain areas as no-go zones for fishing boats,
Mr Clifton Bain, the society's conservation officer, said.
He accused the Scottish Office of a ''complete abdication of power''
and demanded a complete rethink, claiming the proposed monitoring
procedures would not provide adequate review of the fish stocks.
He added that the fishing season decided on was at least a month too
long, and would threaten the recovery of seabirds from a ''breeding
crash'' in the late 1980s, which saw a 75% fall in the number of artic
terns over the decade and less drastic reduction in the kittiwake,
puffin, Artic and great skua population.

The search was centred on woods and open ground where Mr Paul
Morgan,30, is known to walk.
He left the family home in Bridgefoot, on the outskirts of Dundee, at
noon on Wednesday, intending to go for a walk near his house, but did
not return.
Police said the missing man recently had been on medication from his
doctor.
Mr Morgan is described as 5ft 8in tall, of slim build, with brown hair
and a pale complexion.
When last seen, he was wearing a purple squared rugby top, navy
jogging trousers and white trainers.
As the search went on yesterday, police appealed for information.

WHEN Socialist Isobel Lindsay voted yesterday it was a labour of love.
She voted with her heart and put X beside the name of her husband,
Scottish National Party candidate Tom McAlpine.
Tom was fighting to retain his seat in Biggar for the SNP in the new
South Lanarkshire Council.
However, 12 miles away in Lanark, Isobel had been campaigning for a
Labour candidate. She did not canvass in Biggar for her husband.
She did, however, make the tea for SNP followers using her home as the
local headquarters.
Isobel was a key figure in the SNP's hierarchy but walked out because
the party refused to co-operate with the Scottish Constitutional
Convention.
Yesterday Isobel, 51, a mother-of-three, headed for the polls and
said: ''There's no Labour candidate in Biggar so I have no difficulty.
But had there been a Labour candidate Tom would still have got my
personal vote.''
A lecturer at Strathclyde University's Department of Government,
Isobel believes that a Labour government is Scotland's best hope of
progressing its interests and forming a Scottish Parliament.
Tom, 61, said: ''There are no fights about politics between Isobel and
me, just sensible discussion.
''Of course I'm delighted Isobel voted for me. But it is a bit easier
for her as there is not a Labour person standing.''
Tom was in a straight fight with Tory candidate Charles Thorpe, 38.
He fought on his past record of success in getting new council house
and sheltered houses as well as a day-care centre for the town.
Mr Thorpe decided to stand because he was furious at council attempts
to foist the Biggar road plan on local residents.
*A man from the west coast of Scotland yesterday made a political
protest at his local polling station because he was not allowed to vote.
For German Reiner Luyken has lived in Achiltibuie, Wester Ross for the
past 18 years and was able to vote in the Highlands and Islands European
elections last year.
But Britain is not due to ratify the part of the Maastricht Treaty
which allows EU residents to vote in other member countries' elections
until next January.
The 40-year-old asked for a report to be sent to the Returning Officer
after he was refused the right to register his vote at Achiltibuie
village hall.
He is now calling on other disenfranchised EU nationals to do the same
in the local elections in England and Wales and make a strong political
point.
Mr Reiner said: ''There seems to be a lack of understanding about the
situation people like myself find themselves in. If enough people
highlight the problem something may be done about it.''

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns was at Seamill last night -- that
traditional big-game headquarters for the club -- trying to make sure
his players will arrive at Ibrox tonight free of the cares which have
beset Parkhead over the past five years.
It sounds simple when Burns tells you: ''We must have the players
relaxed and in the right frame of mind. We have to have them thinking
positively, take them away from the nerves which people think will
affect them.''
The players insist that this time out they will not be affected. Even
the recent memory of the Coca-Cola Cup final defeat will not interfere
with what they have to do against Hibernian in this Scottish Cup
semi-final.
It all sounds good. Captain Paul McStay, who suffered more than anyone
on the day Raith Rovers defeated Celtic on penalties, insists: ''The
hurt is going away now. There is no denying just how much hurt we all
felt back then. But that is in the past. We have to go out against Hibs
and change things for this club.
''We want to be in a final again and we have to defeat Hibs to do
that, to be there, and to get the chance to end the years without a
trophy.''
Hibs do, of course, stand in the way. They go to Ibrox with none of
the hang-ups which may afflict Celtic. The burden of expectation does
not hit them in the same way. Their support can he kept happy with a
semi-final appearance.
Sure they want more, but they don't have that same overwhelming belief
that consumes Celtic fans. They don't believe they must win trophies
every year. A League Cup win a couple of seasons back was a bonus. A
Scottish Cup victory would bring them the trophy for only the second
time this century.
It would also push manager Alex Miller and his current team into any
Easter Road Hall of Fame.
Miller recognises that and points out: ''The occasion won't affect my
players. There are lads in the team now who look for the big games, who
want to play on the big stage. That's where Darren Jackson and Michael
O'Neil and Keith Wright shine.
''It's also where Jim Leighton is at his best. This is a game these
players and the others will relish.''
Burns had a slight worry over John Collins and Phil O'Donnell on
Wednesday, when both reported with colds, but yesterday they were in the
squad that departed for Ayrshire to prepare for the Ibrox sell-out.
Yesterday, Burns was saying all the right things. He was trying to
dismiss talk of tension, stressing how well his team had played against
Hibs in their previous meetings this season, and emphasising the
confidence he feels by admitting that his team has been selected,
although it will remain under wraps until kick-off time.
He explained: ''I have picked the team and told the players. We have
work to do and they have to know they are playing.
''I believe that we have the men to win this game and go on to lift
cup. I don't think they will be affected by the pressure. We want them
to go out and enjoy this game, you have to enjoy the big moments in your
career. There is no point going into these games thinking any other way.
''Ibrox is a great stage for any player. We enjoy playing there and we
want that to continue. Everyone knows there are pressures, but at this
level you have to live with them, and if we can go on to win the trophy
then we will be remembered as the squad which changed things round after
the bad years.''
That could, indeed, be the scenario. I do think that Celtic will win
tonight, helped by a support desperate for success. And boosted, too, by
a group of players who are equally desperate to prove they can be
winners and who accept, to a man, that to do so they must shrug off the
disappointments of the recent past.
This could become the watershed Burns has hoped for, the victory he
needs to restore a collective faith to his team.
Victory will not be easily achieved and it may not be attractive.
After all, the only thing which matters tonight is the result.
* HIBS have arranged a tea-time start for their up-coming premier
division match against Falkirk. Supporters are being alerted that the
game at Easter Road, scheduled for Tuesday, April 18, has been switched
to the following day, and as Hibs have problems with floodlighting, it
will kick off at 5pm.
The match between Kilmarnock and Rangers, also scheduled for the
Tuesday, has been switched to the Thursday with a 7.45pm kick-off as it
is being shown live on Sky TV.

A TORY councillor is to appear in court to face 11 charges of criminal
deception over alleged expenses irregularities, police said yesterday.
Mr Bryan Metz is Conservative education spokesman on Cumbria County
Council, where no party has overall control.
He had been summonsed to appear before magistrates at Penrith on May
3, said a police spokesman.
The summonses had been issued following consideration by the Crown
Prosecution Service of papers about alleged irregularities in Mr Metz's
expenses claimed from both the county council and Eden District Council
in connection with his attendance at meetings.
''The allegations centre on a period of time from January 1993 to June
1994,'' added the spokesman.
Police inquiries began more than five months ago.
Mr Metz represents Alston on both the county and district councils. He
was first elected to the county council in 1989 as an Independent but
joined the Tories in 1993, said a council spokesman.

<HEADLINE>Scotch Quality Beef Lamb Association takes over.  Revamped FASL given backing</HEADLINE>

THE Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb Association is to take over
responsibility for administering the Farm Assured Scotch Livestock
scheme, which was designed to promote quality assurance at farm level.
Farmers had shown a distinct reluctance to join the FASL scheme which
required them to pay membership fees of up to #400 a year.
That hurdle has been removed by an agreement under which the re-vamped
scheme will be financed through the Guild of Scotch Quality Meat
Producers and the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in Scotland.
Nine of Scotland's major meat companies have agreed to back the new
system and meet most of the costs.
The institute are also recommending that their members should give it
financial backing. Between them they are expected to contribute up to
#100,000 a year.
While the equivalent scheme for the pig sector achieved 70%
membership, only about 20% of cattle breeders and 15% of sheep breeders
signed up for FASL.
Those who rejected the FASL scheme argued that they could see no
benefit from membership. They wanted a special premium price for their
meat which would reflect the high quality of the product and the
additional costs of being a scheme member.
Some also argued that they were already meeting the standards demanded
by the scheme and could see no reason for buying into it.
From now on the meat companies and the auctioneers will be able to
recognise excellence by nominating producers for scheme membership. Farm
inspections will be carried out to ensure that all requirements are
being met with regard to feeding, accommodation and welfare. Animals
must also be identifiable right through the marketing chain and stock
brought into a farm must be from an approved source.
The Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb Association has previously been
responsbile for promotion and marketing under the banner of ''Specially
Selected Scotch Beef and Lamb.'' Their new logo will include a reference
to ''farm assured'' Scotch beef and lamb.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland, who made strenuous efforts to
encourage members to join up with FASL, described yesterday's
announcement as an important step forward.
Mr John Ross, president, said: ''The union is right behind the farm
assurance marketing concept. It tells our customers a positive story
about top quality Scottish meat produced in ways which give assurances
about the environment and standards of stockmanship. The financial
contribution from the meat trade and the auctioners signalled a
recognition of the developing partnership between all concerend with the
industry's future prospects,'' he said.
Mr Maitland Mackie, chairman of FASL said that he believed an overall
Scottish farm assurance scheme for beef and lamb was essential and much
more desirable than a confusing range of individual meat company and
retailer schemes.
The case for farm assurance was always right in view of the relentless
pressures facing the meat industry, said Mr John Scott, Paisley,
president of the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers. ''SQBLA Farm
Assurance must receive the full and unequivocal support of all sectors
of the industry. It is our lifeline.

A DIRECTOR of knitwear company Pringle will be closely questioned by
civic leaders today over the decision to close the firm's Arbroath
factory with the loss of 221 jobs.
Local politicians have criticised Pringle for giving no warning of
last week's closure announcement.
Dawson International plc, which owns Pringle, made the decision as
part of a jobs cutting exercise across Scotland.
Arbroath already suffers an unemployment rate of nearly 15%, the
highest in Tayside.
The Tayside Major Redundancies Response Group will meet Mr Stewart
Raeburn, a director at Pringle of Scotland, to discuss the situation.
Mr John Dorward, Tayside region's convener of economic development,
said: ''It is vital that all the relevant agencies meet the company and
discuss how best to proceed in the interest of those whose livelihoods
are being affected.
He added: ''I am anxious to enter into negotiations which could be of
use to the workers affected by this announcement.''
Mr Raeburn said: ''We are happy to support this initiative in meeting
the Tayside Response Group.''
The managing director and chairman of the company are unable to attend
the meeting. But Mr Raeburn added they ''will take a keen interest in
the discussions and their outcome''.
Mr Raeburn will be asked to explain the background to the closure
decision.
The local MP, Mr Andrew Welsh, will meet Scottish Industry Minister
George Kynoch next Monday to discuss the closure.

TWO men who have emotive reasons for winning a place in the Tennents
Scottish Cup final, Airdrie's captain Jimmy Sandison and Kenny Black,
also are honest enough to confess that they retain considerable
affection for the team they are desperate to beat tomorrow.
Sandison and Black are former Hearts players, and you would be hard
pushed to get them to voice anything other than happy memories of
Tynecastle.
This will have no effect, of course, on the ferocity of their
commitment to the Airdrie cause once the preliminaries are over at
Hampden, but each admits that, if the worst came to the worst, there
would be at least a small consolation in that some of their pals would
be on the way to the final.
Sandison and Black went through the infamy, not to mention ordeal, of
missing Airdrie's last appearance in the final in 1992 after both
incurred SFA suspensions. The memory lingers painfully for both, neither
of whom is in the spring of his football career. For that reason they
acknowledge, albeit reluctantly, that this may be their last chance.
''With no disrespect to Airdrie,'' said Sandison, ''the fact is that
we are a small club, and when I was sitting in the stand during that
final, I didn't think I would get another chance. Now I am only 90
minutes away.''
Black, 31, recalls the misery of leaving the dressing room at 2.45
that day and would love the opportunity to erase it altogether. ''The
manager had included Jimmy and me in all the preparation,'' he said.
''We did all the work and everything was OK until quarter to three, when
we had to shake hands and leave. When you see the team coming out, it is
hard not to have a lump in your throat.''
Both players can once more sense the possibility of winning the medal
they cherish (''we want to be able to show it to our grandchildren'')
but are aware that it is equally possible that, even if they win, they
must beware suffering the same fate as last time when, coincidentally,
Hearts were also the team they overcame in the semis.
Sandison has to be particularly cautious as he is carrying the burden
of five cautions. One more and the unthinkable could happen again, but
the man has declared that will not be the case. ''Whatever else
happens,'' he said, ''I will not be booked on Saturday. I will need to
tread carefully.''
Sandison describes the enforced absence from the final in 1992 as the
worst moment of his career. ''For me,'' he said, ''it was tough because
I would have led the team out. Not many people get that privilege.''
Black, born in Stenhousemuir, has fond recall of his five years at
Tynecastle. He has friends among the opposition but is just as confident
as Sandison that Airdrie can bridge the gap between the first and
premier divisions to get to the last hurdle.
''I would say we are a better footballing side than the one that lost
to Rangers in 1992,'' he said, ''but that team had a little more
battling quality. Owen Coyle also gave that team a bit of class in the
striking department, but we are capable of beating anyone in a one-off
game.''
* FOR a man brought up on great playing success, Airdrie manager Alex
MacDonald has been able to carry the burden of underdog manager with
admirable fortitude, but signs that even his equable attitude is
beginning to crack were seen yesterday when he responded to presumptions
being made about who will be in the final next month.
MacDonald has always enjoyed the scenario that gives his team little
chance, because it motivates them, as they did three years ago when they
beat Hearts in a semi-final.
However, when it was mentioned to him that there had been speculation
about the possibility of an all-Edinburgh final, he became bullish.
''Without any doubt we love that kind of talk,'' he said. ''It suits
us. I know the people in Edinburgh. They have a nice castle, but I think
Celtic (who meet Hibs in the other semi) and ourselves will make sure
there is at least one team from this part of the world in the final.''
MacDonald also has made an appeal to his board to find some way of
rewarding the players, who have spent this season in a kind of limbo as
they play at Clyde's stadium, Broadwood on Saturdays and train at
Strathclyde Park during the week.
''I am pleased with the way the players have worked hard, despite the
problems. I think the atmosphere at Hampden will be a boost for our
players after the small crowds at Broadwood.''

<HEADLINE>J &amp; W Greig abandons plan to buy wool direct from producers</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>4</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979009777</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDRIA-based wool merchants J &amp; W Greig have bowed to pressure
from the British Wool Marketing Board to abandon their plan to buy wool
directly from Scottish producers, acting as agents for a Portuguese
company.
Greig's plan would have allowed them to by-pass the board's purchase
system under which all producers with more than four sheep have to sell
their wool through the board.
While accepting the latest prescriptive resolution issued by the board
-- effectively scuppering their plans -- Greig accused them of using
their powers ''to change this country's import laws without having to
refer to Parliament.'' The company indicated that they wished to reserve
their position on the issue and would be drawing it to the attention of
the European Commission.
Last week it appeared that Greig had won a victory when the board
withdrew from a legal action at the Court of Session in which they
sought to prevent Greig from buying wool direct from Scottish farmers
while acting as agents for the Portuguese subsidiary of an English firm
of carpet manufacturers. The wool was destined for premises in Southern
Ireland owned by the Portuguese subsidiary company.
''It is now obvious why the board conceded the court case,'' said Mr
John King, Greig's managing director. ''Had the court found in our
favour, then a legal precedent would have been established. By
conceding, and paying our costs, the board were free to issue a new
prescriptive resoltion to achieve their objective.''
Mr Alun Evans, wool board chairman, said that the proposed arrangement
between Greig and the Poruguese subsidiary of carpet manufacturers
Brintons was an artificial device to by-pass the board's purchase
scheme. The board issued a resolution, aimed at clarifying earlier
statements, making it clear that in selling any wool for export there
should be no intention of subsequently importing any of the wool back
into the UK in its greasy state.''
Mr Richard Netherwood, technical and marketing director of the wool
board claimed that it had been the intention that wool exported to
Southern Ireland would be sold on to a third party -- Brintons, carpet
manufacturers, at Kidderminster in Shropshire.
The board's central purchasing scheme benefited the 90,000 wool
producers in Britain by providing stability and unity, he said. Greig's
move, he believed would have undermined that system and would have
benefited buyers rather than producers.
The board have forecast that for the coming season, as a result of
improved wool prices, they will be paying about 120p a kilogramme. This
would be the highest price paid, per kilo, since the board's inception
in 1950.

LIFE is looking good for Watts Blake Bearne as the world's largest
ball clay company was talking yesterday of opportunities being greater
than for many years and tremendous profit potential in several years
time.
Profits last year rose 14.7% to #9.88m and if the exceptional costs
associated with the 1993 takeover bid by Sibelco of Belgium are
excluded, the advance was 28.3%.
Market reaction was to push the narrowly held shares up 18p to 495p
where they yield 3.5% on the dividend total raised 12.5% to 13.5p with a
9.6p final.
Managing director John Pike said the impetus came from the success of
the Devon clays export business with tonnage sales up by 17.5%. There
were strong markets in the Middle and Far East which helped push revenue
ahead by 19% to #42m or almost half group turnover 13% greater at #86m.
However, demand from the UK ceramics industry saw growth tailing off
as the year progressed although there was compensation from increasing
sales to Spain. Ball clay accounts for about a quarter of the volume of
sanitaryware such as lavatories. Although these are regarded as being no
more than simply basic essentials in British homes which are never
replaced, they are fashion items in Italy and Spain and, therefore,
demand is more buoyant.
The German operations were inhibited on the export front by the high
level of the mark when selling German-made products to Italy -- Watts
Blake has about 40% of overall German production as a result of last
autumn's #11m purchase of Martin &amp; Pagenstecher. The problems in Mexico
have led to a #250,000 provision against profits of United Clays in the
US but it is expected that this will be recovered later.
Future growth will come initially from expanding the Far East
operations in Thailand and China and Ukraine where marketing and
technical agreements are already in place which should be a substantial
boon once the CIS begins to upgrade its housing.
The key to the company is, however, in the hands of Sibelco which sits
on a 47.7% stake which can be increased at any moment to 48.6% and by a
similar amount each year until it has control -- it has three board
seats. However, WBB has remarkably loyal shareholders led by M&amp;G.
Profits this year should hit #12.5m which would leave the shares
selling at 14 times possible earnings and represent excellent value on
fundamental trading considerations.

Liberty, whose fabrics and prints have long been a staple of
upper-class fashion, has seen the last two members of its founding
family to sit on its board resign.
Brothers Oliver and Richard Stewart-Liberty have both given up their
directorships, although Richard will still retain his post as head of
the firm's Liberty brand products division.
The move ends more than a century of tradition since the firm, which
has a prestigious flagship store just off London's Regent Street, was
founded in 1875.
''The group has changed over the years. We have become more modern,''
said Liberty's chairman Harry Weblin.
''Both brothers have played an important role in assisting the company
to transform itself from a predominantly family business to a modern
organisation,'' he said.
Weblin added that the resignations were voluntary and that keeping the
family's links with the firm was still important.

ENGINEERING group James Dickie yesterday doubled its interim dividend
to 2p, as it announced a 42% increase in pre-tax profits to #891,000.
However, while expressing the board's confidence in the continued
prosperity of the formerly Ayrshire-based company, chairman Peter
Bullock highlighted continuing pressures on raw material costs.
Shares in Dickie, which is now run from Bedfordshire, lost 7p to 208p
in spite of the leap in dividend.
The 42% earnings increase was achieved in spite of a #97,000 provision
for a potential bad debt which came to light after the halfway point but
was included in the interim figures.
Turnover in the six months to end-February was up 32% on the first
half of Dickie's previous financial year at #14.0m, boosted by general
improvements in demand and more specific new business.
After years of losses or insipid profits at best, Dickie was
effectively taken over by Goldstar four years ago, with the English
company having overseen a steady return to far healthier figures.
This time last year the engineering components manufacturer, which
supplies the construction and vehicle industries, announced its first
interim dividend for four years.

INCHINNAN-based Eclipse Blinds yesterday reported its return to the
black, after a dramatic recovery from the near-death experience it
suffered during its days as the Ashley Group.
The refocused window blinds company made pre-tax profits of #4.42m in
the year to end-December, after a #20.6m loss in its previous financial
year. Its shares, which plunged to 4[1/2]p last February, yesterday put
on more than 10% to 15p.
Gearing was reduced from 2100% to 196%. Net debt was almost halved,
falling from #18.5m to #9.53m during the year.
The reduction was largely attributable to Eclipse's disposal of French
assembly subsidiary Storflex and of its Apollo Blinds retail franchise,
which realised #4.26m in cash as well as reducing debt by #1.65m.
The disposals gave rise to a net exceptional credit of #910,000, which
is included in the earnings figure of #4.42m. A #2.52m gain on the
disposals was offset by a #1.54m accounting charge for goodwill
previously written off and by a #70,000 restructuring charge relating to
the group.
Operational cash flow also relieved the pressure of borrowings. The
bottom-line of the gearing ratio was helped by a five-fold-plus increase
in net assets attributable to shareholders to #4.84m.
During the year, the revamped Eclipse Blinds concluded negotiations
with its bankers and some creditors to defer the bulk of repayments due
until January 1996. It has met the associated conditions relating to
reduction of overall group debt.
Twelve months ago, a rescue rights issue was, in the words of company
doctor and chairman Hamish Grossart, patently needed.
However, in light of the high prices received for its two 1994
disposals, the Eclipse board now has a choice.
The possibility of a rights issue -- albeit a substantially smaller
one than the #10m cash-call originally envisaged -- will be considered
later this year.
However, it will only come to pass if the board considers the
resultant cash beneficial in terms of expansion opportunities, or if a
speedier return to the dividend list is considered advantageous.
Following its recovery from its disastrous and massive involvement in,
and subsequent departure from, the Spanish food retailing business, Mr
Grossart has refocused the group around its window blind merchandised
distribution activities in the UK, Northern Europe, and North America.
Turnover in continuing window blind and plywood and timber operations
was up 8% at #35.1m in 1994.
The extent of the recent changes within the group are reflected in a
sales from discontinued operations figure of nearly #131m in 1993, which
contrasts sharply with the corresponding 1994 figure of only #3.86m.
In 1993, an exceptional loss on sale of the Spanish business and
''fundamental restructuring'' costs totalled #22.1m.
Mr Grossart, who outlined a three-year rescue plan to the City about a
year ago, believes the group is two-thirds of the way through this and
is well and truly off the danger list.
Outstanding litigation relating to Eclipse's former Spanish operations
is not considered material in relation to the group as a whole. The
company believes sufficient provisions exist to cover these matters.
First-quarter turnover from continuing activities was this year about
8% ahead of the same period of 1994 and a ''second year of markedly
improving fortunes for Eclipse'' is envisaged by the company.

New York, Thursday -- Shares in Apple Computer rose sharply on
rumours, later denied, that Japanese electronics giant Canon was
planning a $54.50 per share bid for the personal computer maker.
Apple was up $1.75 at $36.375 early on Nasdaq, where it was among the
most active issues. It had traded as high as $40 in London.
According to market rumours in London, Canon is in talks to buy Apple
for $54.50 a share and the companies are likely to reach a definitive
agreement within two weeks. Canon said it has no intention of buying
Apple.
''We are not about to buy Apple and we are not even thinking of doing
so,'' said a Canon spokesman in Tokyo.
Apple would not comment on the rumour. ''This is just the latest of a
long line of rumours,'' a spokesman said.
Philips Electronics has dismissed speculation that it was interested
in Apple. Others, including Oracle and IBM have also been seen as
possible suitors.
However, industry analysts say Apple seems increasingly in need of a
white knight.
Dataquest, a major computer research company, is predicting that as a
result of the launch of Microsoft's new Windows 95 operating system this
summer, Apple's share of the operating system market will plunge by more
than half over the next five years to just 5%.

IBM chairman Louis Gerstner yesterday said the giant computer maker
anticipates good financial results this year. A profit for 1995 would
give Big Blue two straight years of earnings in the black, which
analysts attribute to Gerstner's firm restructuring since he took the
helm in 1993.
IBM had a net profit of $3000m in 1994, a turnaround from three years
of losses.
He said that although the recent weakness of the dollar may help IBM's
earnings slightly in the first quarter of this year, the dollar's level
was not a significant issue affecting IBM's profitability.
IBM is not only a US company, it has many businesses outside the
United States, said Mr Gerstner. IBM makes long-term investments and
long-term contracts, and it is in IBM's interests to have some stability
in currency rates, he added.
Mr Gerstner, who was in Tokyo for a strategy meeting of senior IBM
executives, also said that restructuring of IBM's personal computer
business has only just begun. Unlike the general restructuring which has
gone on for two years, programmes to transform the PC business have only
been in place for four to six months, he said. ''It will be well into
1996 until we complete these programmes,'' he said.
According to researcher Dataquest, IBM was overtaken in 1994 as the
world's leading PC manufacturer for the first time. The PC market is
expected to be worth $543bn this year, gaining eight percent over 1994,
Dataquest has said.
IBM had an 8.5% share of the world market in 1994, down from 10.8% the
previous year, according to the researcher.
Mr Gerstner emphasised that troubles in the PC area were not due to
the company's inability to develop successful products. ''Our problem
has been not being able to keep demand and supply in sync.''
He said IBM is currently unable to supply enough of its popular
Butterfly sub-notebook computers.
Mr Gerstner said one of IBM's three priorities was to enable customers
to manage their complex systems. He said IBM was investing a lot of
money in this area.
Another priority was to make PCs easier to use. There is a lot of new
technology, but it is still difficult to use or even start up a
computer, he said. By the end of the decade users should be able to talk
to a computer and not have to sit in front of a keyboard, he added.
He said the third priority was to provide a means to cut the time
required to write software programs. The current technology is 30 years
old, he said.
The IBM chairman would not comment on the content of the company
meetings earlier this week. But he said they were a good opportunity for
executives to learn about technology and operations in Japan.
IBM Japan produces about 12% of the Armonk, New York-based company's
overall revenues and provides important technical developments -- Reuter

RICHARD Branson's Virgin Communications group is joining forces with
four other companies to prepare a bid for the Channel 5 television
franchise which is expected to be awarded in the autumn.
The consortium includes Associated Newspapers, Philips Electronics,
HTV, and Electra Investment Trust. It has been preparing its bid for
several months, so that it is now ready to finalise the documentation.
Formal bids have to be submitted within about a month.
The team promises ''a very substantial financial and technical
commitment as well as an enterprising new approach to programming''. It
is being advised by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Management Consultants.
Robert Devereux, the Virgin chairman who also acts as chairman of the
consortium, commented: ''The partners have been deliberately selected to
provide a strong combination of creative, financial and technical
resources and capabilities. Together we will represent a significant new
force in British television.''
All the participants have existing broadcasting interests. Virgin
operates the second national pop radio station, Virgin 1215, and
launches a new London FM station on Monday. It has stakes in various
production companies.
Associated Newspapers' chairman Sir David English said: ''With a
substantial budget available we intend to commission a wide range of
original new programming.''
However, the Virgin consortium will be up against formidable
competition, with three other major consortia also putting the final
touches to their bids, each with particular strengths. The Pearson-led
group has the advantage of having Greg Dyke, a major figure in the
industry, leading it. Mirror Group is backed by NBC, the big American
television company, while the BSkyB consortium has the benefit of
existing television experience.
There is doubt in the industry over how profitable Channel 5 can be
because of the competition from satellite and cable. Most of the main
population centres will be able to receive the new channel though large
areas in the lowlands of Scotland as well as the Highlands will not be
able to get it.
A condition of the franchise is that the winner is responsible for
converting viewers' video recorders to receive the Channel 5 signal,
which will represent a significant cost to add to normal start-up
expenses.

DON Cruickshank, Scots-born director general of Oftel, the
telecommunications watchdog, has stepped down from his position as a
non-executive director of Christian Salvesen after just over a year.
A statement from the distribution and transport group said that he had
resigned ''to avoid any possible future conflict of interest.''
A Salvesen spokesman explained that the group was not about to enter
the mainstream telecommunications business, rather that its logistics
division might be getting involved in the periphery of the industry,
such as the transport of telecommunications equipment.
Mr Cruickshank was appointed to the board in March last year and
Salvesen chairman Sir Alick Rankin commented in his last annual report
that his contribution to the board's deliberations was ''much
appreciated''.
In common with the three other non-executive directors (not including
Sir Alick) Mr Cruickshank served on Salvesen's remuneration and audit
committees. According to the last annual report, Mr Cruickshank holds no
shares in the group.

<HEADLINE>Production figures further evidence of slowdown Flat manufacturing output is at odds with CBI surveys</HEADLINE>

FURTHER signs emerged yesterday that the economy is slowing down in
response to higher taxes and interest rates, but there was scepticism in
the City about an apparently flat trend in manufacturing activity
continuing.
Rises of 0.3% in industrial production and 0.5% in manufacturing
output in February were lower than had been expected by independent
economists. Both had fallen back in January, but not by as much as
originally thought. The January drop in manufacturing was revised down
from 0.6% to 0.4%.
The figures helped the stock market rally from early losses,
especially as the authorities again left interest rates unchanged
following Wednesday's meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George.
The FTSE-100 added 10.7 points to 3200.9. Although shares closed well
below their best levels of the day it was the first time that the
Footsie index had closed above 3200 since September 7.
In the latest three months manufacturing stood still and industrial
production retreated by 0.3%, dragged down by a 4.4% fall in the output
of the electricity, gas, and water industries, which were hit by the
mild weather.
Output figures are volatile, and statisticians prefer to take their
lead from three-monthly trends rather than individual month's figures.
The flat trend in manufacturing contrasts with increases of around
1.5% in the first half of last year. James Capel's Adam Cole said
manufacturing output had slowed very significantly.
But it may have done no more than pause for breath after the hectic
pace of activity last year. Compared with the same three months a year
ago, manufacturing is 3.9% higher and industrial production 4.3% ahead.
Even electricity, gas, and water output is 3.4% up, while the mining
and quarrying sector, which is dominated by Britain's booming oil and
gas extraction industries, has increased production by 8.6%.
The output figures are in contrast to the bullish tone of recent CBI
surveys, which have highlighted the strength of output in manufacturing,
record exports, and full order books.
The Treasury itself was sceptical. ''The figures indicate a slowdown
in the pace of expansion, but business surveys continue to point to a
healthy manufacturing sector based on export success.''
Mr Cole made the point that not only were exports surging, but
investment was recovering strongly from a prolonged period of weakness.
The CBI surveys would be consistent with manufacturing growing at 5% to
6% annually instead of less than 4%.
A breakdown of the figures showed that output of the consumer
industries increased by 0.7% in the latest three months, while the
investment goods industries were flat and intermediate goods industries
posted a fall of 0.9%.
One explanation for the difference between the official figures and
the survey evidence could be destocking by both manufacturers and
distributors. This would have the effect of temporarily depressing
output.
Some economists pointed to the constant process of revision to output
figures as more information becomes available, and said that they
expected the most recent data to be revised upwards, but it is unlikely
that this would make a great deal of difference to the lack-lustre trend
in recent months.
The pound lost more ground yesterday on the back of a further fall in
the dollar, which some independent forecasters have suggested is in
terminal decline.
Sterling has fallen sharply against most European currencies this
year, and this is expected to boost exports to the Continent. So it is
likely that manufacturing activity will pick up in the months ahead,
putting fresh pressure on capacity.
However, a slowdown in first quarter growth in gross domestic product
can be expected. Industrial production looks like contributing nothing,
leaving the service sector to set the pace.
On April 25, the Central Statistical Office has its first stab at
calculating first-quarter GDP, and on the basis of the indicators
published so far growth of around 0.5% or even less could be expected.
This would represent a slowdown from the 0.8% quarterly growth rates
recorded in the third and fourth quarters of last year.
For a time the Government and the Bank of England may be able to claim
that the economy has slowed down to a more sustainable rate of growth,
but few economists think that this can be achieved without at least one
more rise in base rates.
Many independent economists think that this could occur as early as
May 5 when the Chancellor and the Governor next meet, if for no other
reason than to compensate for the easing in policy implicit in
sterling's fall this year.
Meanwhile, there is a good chance that rates will peak at a lower
level than in past cycles and that the worst fears of the futures
markets will not be borne out by events.

THE powers of chiefs of public companies, especially utilities, to
appoint and agree the fees of supposedly independent external auditors
must be examined, the new president of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland believes.
Niall Lothian, who takes over from Primrose McCabe at the annual
general meeting of the institute's council in Glasgow today , is aware
that a change in Government may throw up a raft of new public interest
considerations for the profession.
The new president is also conscious of the perception of external
auditors as people who will shy away from biting the hands of the public
companies which feed them their biggest fees.
Professor Lothian, 47, the first full-time academic to be appointed
president in 20 years, yesterday questioned whether it was right that
directors continued to appoint and strike the fee level with the
auditors.
He added: ''Sections of the public are sceptical, and I think rightly
sceptical, that this can throw up a truly independent audit.
''I would like the institute, in the next 12 months, to overhaul some
of its thinking in this matter. It is rather easy, after 15 years of one
government, to regard the public interest as fairly static.''
Professor Lothian, chair of accounting at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt
University, believes it is particularly important to look at the
question of audit independence as it relates to utilities and banks.
Particularly in the wake of the Barings collapse, the public has a
right to be interested in the true financial state of the banks which
hold their savings or advanced their mortgages.
On the utilities side, they have a vested interest in the maintenance
of a quality service.
Utilities have recently been lambasted over a whole range of issues,
including exorbitant pay rises to the likes of British Gas managing
director Cedric Brown.
However, in the absence of any surefire solution to the audit
independence issue, Professor Lothian is aware that the institute may
ultimately come up with a ''reasoned and logical argument for the status
quo''.
Professor Lothian also pledged to spend more time with the
profession's critics than most of his predecessors at the head of the
UK's accounting bodies. These critics include MPs, users and practising
accountants.
He said: ''Too many times these critics are ignored or dismissed,
simply because of some professional vested interest that is going to be
disturbed.''
Meanwhile, Professor Lothian will continue ICAS's resistance to any
amalgamation with any of the UK's other five accounting bodies.
He believes the institute must first address the relevance of its work
to users, as well as its quality.
He said: ''When you suspect outbreaks of dry rot in the house, you
don't cure the problem by rearranging the furniture.''
ICAS is also to change the tack of its in-house training, making
trainee chartered accountants aware of clients' needs for business
advice as well as corporate policemen.

<HEADLINE>Housebuilding lifts McAlpine's profits</HEADLINE>

HOUSEBUILDING provided most of the impetus for construction group
Alfred McAlpine, whose profits increased to #10.7m before tax in the 14
months to end December against #1.2m in the 12 months to October 31,
1993 when it had to take a #6.5m exceptional charge.
The figures are perhaps a shade lower than best market projections but
not signficantly so and the homes side exceeded the volume projections
made at the time of the company's rights issue in June last year.
Not that everything is all rosy, conditions continue to be very tough
in construction, and even on the housing side the group is not
overwhelmingly enthusiastic about current conditions.
A strong balance sheet allied to the results has, though, enabled the
final dividend to be lifted from 3.5p to 4p taking the total from 6.5p
to 7p on earnings per share up from 0.7p to 10.2p.
Operating margins from house sales increased to 9.6% from 8% in 1993
and there was a sharp rise in operating profits as McAlpine benefited
from an increase in completions and higher selling prices with the
average up from #79,400 to #90,000.
The price improvement resulted from planned changes in geographic and
product mix rather than overall selling price increases. There was an an
improvement from 13.8% to 15.7% in the average gross margin on housing
developments. At the pre-tax level, housing profits rose from #5.5m to
#13m.
But while housing started encouragingly, market demand weakened in the
second half of 1994 and reservations drifted back to 1993 levels.
Notable price rises were achieved in South-east England, but prices
remained weak generally in other areas of the operation. Even so,
McAlpine has carried forward into 1995 a healthier order book for houses
under construction than in any year since 1989.
However, pressure on margins generally is developing, as rising costs
exceed the ''modest'' upward movement in house prices.
McAlpine's answer is to pursue cost reductions through the achievement
of production efficiencies, review of designs and specifications, and
better buying.
Construction proved difficult and the group suffered, along with the
rest of the industry. The company registered a loss of #4.5m before tax
against a #3m profit last time though without losses in eastern Germany
and the Midlands Region, there would have been a small profit.
Elsewhere, minerals saw an increase in profits from #1.2m to #4.5m,
and the US operations also improved their contribution, from #1.7m to
#2m.
Looking ahead, McAlpine, under its chief executive Oliver Whitehead,
yesterday described current conditions in the housing market as
''challenging'', emphasising that new housing continues to represent
excellent value for money for the buyer. He said the company expected to
compete at the upper levels of performance for the industry within
prevailing market conditions.
In construction, it is too early to predict the speed of progress of
the Private Finance Initiative, but the company considers it is well
positioned to take advantage of future developments.
The US market offers good prospects for improved results in 1995, as
the strong performance of aggregates is expected to continue, at a time
when there will be a significant recovery in the results of the American
construction business. Overall, there should be a further advance for
McAlpine in 1995.
Down 5p at 145p, the shares are selling at 14 times earnings and yield
6.4%.

IBSTOCK has been given access to the books of Tarmac's brickmaking
businesses after making an unsolicited approach to buy just under 10% of
Britain's brick capacity, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The division supplies about half Tarmac housing's requirements -- the
1994 results due on Tuesday are expected to show that it built about
6500 units during the year.
It produces about 300 million bricks a year compared with Ibstock's
400 million. Brickmaking is generally regarded as not being a core
activity even if it had been increased in size in 1993 when Tarmac
swapped its clay roof tiles operations for Marley's brickmaking
facilities.
It is suggested that if there is a sale, the amount involved will be
below the #90m at which the division is carried in th Tarmac balance
sheet.

The supermarkets' cut-price petrol has fuelled a new offensive on the
forecourts of the country. And soon, as Elizabeth Buie reports, the
shelves could be stacked in the favour of the petrol stations
ONCE upon a time, you could count yourself lucky if your local petrol
station sold a sliced white loaf, a can of anti-freeze, and a packet of
chewing gum.
Then, mixed bunches of flowers, wilting in the petrol fumes, started
to adorn the frontages. Soon there were sandwiches, freshly-made and
date-stamped, and microwaves to heat up the instant meals on sale.
By the early 1990s the revolution was complete. The petrol station
mini-market had been launched and was ready to take on the supermarkets.
Hailed as the shopping phenomenon of the decade, we now have a new
breed of filling station which doubles as a snack-bar cafeteria and
convenience shop. This is the fastest-growing but least-predicted area
in retailing today. It is locked in conflict with the nation's growing
chains of supermarkets, but must inevitably have an effect on
traditional village shops, small independents, and Asian corner shops.
From the petrol retailers' point of view, however, these new-style
convenience stores must succeed or the petrol companies will lose any
profitability in the face of competition from supermarkets.
The petrol-station shop is also having an impact on motorway service
stations -- one reason why James Denning, a director of Roadchef,
studied the new retailing phenomenon for his MBA at Stirling University.
The petrol retailers are, he says, not only up against out-of-town
superstores with their cheap petrol operations, but also smaller
supermarkets setting up their own stand-alone petrol forecourts with
convenience stores attached.
''Even fighting back by improving shop frontages and on-site
facilities, the normal operator is still going to be under threat,'' he
said.
As a result, the petrol retailers have had to target the less
price-sensitive fuel customer, such as people on business expenses.
Last year, for the first time, magistrates in East Molesey in Surrey
granted an alcohol licence to a garage, largely because they accepted
that food retailing was the prime function of the site rather than
selling petrol.
Last month BP were granted an off-sales licence for Earlsgate Filling
Station in Grangemouth. A company spokesman said: ''We are planning to
open several more outlets as soon as possible.''
Yet, James Denning says that retailers should not assume that it will
be an easy task to get a licence.
''The authorities seem to think that the fact that it is associated
with petrol means that people are going to drink and drive. But this
thinking does not seem to apply to supermarkets or the fact that most
people drive to off-licences,'' he said.
The petrol retailer is relying on his customers' laziness. He hopes
that if they are travelling home past his station, they will pull off
the road to buy the convenience goods they need. With more and more
parking restrictions on high streets, customers now expect to be able to
park and shop elsewhere. To tempt them further, however, some operators
are installing in-store bakeries, chemist counters, and some are even
opening up post offices.
Mr Denning sees the three main players developing along slightly
different routes:
* Esso -- in-store bakeries, larger and larger forecourt shops;
* Shell -- promoting the convenience element and premium pricing their
products;
* Texaco -- developing something in the middle of the price range.
Texaco is experimenting with stand-alone shops, without petrol.
Environmental legislation is thought to be behind this policy. With
requirements for petrol pumps to have special vapour-trapping nozzles,
the cost of re-equipping all its garages may be considered more trouble
than its worth.
Dr Paul Freathy, a lecturer in Stirling University's Department of
Retail Studies, said that as French hypermarkets were estimated to have
only 14% of the petrol retail market share, retailers in this country
were relatively unconcerned when British supermarkets moved into this
area. But supermarkets have managed to secure prime locations and are
currently selling between 15% and 18% of the petrol market.
''We can expect supermarkets to sell 25% of all petrol which is a huge
chunk out of the petrol companies' market, so they have to diversify
into convenience stores,'' he said.
He predicts they will continue to diversify their operations so that
they are seen to offer something different.
''They have huge industries behind them with expertise in
management,'' he said.
For the foreseeable future, the petrol wars are likely to be waged
alongside the shopping wars.

Hi-tech hopes of computerised shopping are being countered by stores
willing to shelve their old ways to keep their customers, finds Jennifer
Cunningham
OUTSIDE the homeless stand guard with The Big Issue. Inside the girls
with the clipboards hover to solicit opinion from a passing statistic.
It is not just the commercial outlets who see the mall as meat trap.
The technocrat economists who are the soothsayers of our age predict
the ceramic murals, the fountains and the great glass elevators will all
come tumbling down when the electronic revolution displays the
merchandise on our television screens and we buy by remote control.
Maybe, but more likely not. ''They've been telling us for years that we
will soon be ordering what we want by computer or television screen, but
wherever there have been trials, there have been problems,'' said Dr
Steve Burt of the Institute of Retail Studies at Stitling University.
''Although shops save on store costs and there are software systems for
organising delivery routes, there are transport costs involved in
delivering direct to the door. There has been a recent experiment in
Paris by the French chain Casino, but they are not claiming it as a
success.
''They have to offer some form of extra service. Small shops used to
be able to compete by opening late. That gave us the 'eight till late'
policy of the Spar group of independents, but the supermarkets have been
extending their hours and we now have a 24-hour Asda store in England
and the prospect of one in Glasgow. Small shops cannot compete with
that. Even local deliveries mean additional costs including petrol and
the driver's time and possibly a larger van,'' added Burt.
Supermarkets offer the clearest example, because the profit margins on
groceries are so tight. All the big players are cutting down the number
of deliveries to their shops, getting everything in bigger loads each
time.
The consumerist conundrum is that serious shoppers are those whose
hobby is shopping, with money to spend on inessentials and time to spend
comparing colour and price and high fashion scores out of 10. Every
Mother Hubbard hurrying home to a bare cupboard and hungry children
shops as the alternative to starvation: bread, meat, fruit, veg and a
dash to the shortest checkout queue.
Her sister, on another day perhaps her alter ego, the serious
housewife, is a different proposition. She may step smartly into the
first aisle with list in hand, but she will linger to choose between
different brands or weigh up the day's special offer and she will reward
herself either by adding some unnecessary or personal item to the
housekeeping budget or with a cup of coffee in the supermarket cafe.
One retail analyst says the best predictor of what anyone will buy is
who they are shopping with. Granny with children is almost certain to
head for the sweet shop. Ma, pa and weans will not leave the supermarket
with exactly the same pile of goods as ma on her own.
Price has been the prime consideration since the days of barter, but
quality and service also have to be there. That's why they are opening
more creches -- because mum is likely to spend longer without toddlers
demanding every goody within reach -- and if the opposition has one,
they had better compete.
Certainly more common in shops where parents need time to confer, such
as furniture warehouses. The exception is the covered shopping centre
where once released from captivity the young of the species can be
rewarded for good behaviour by a meal, sweets or small toys.
Chief criticism of the mall in its British incarnation is that the
same group of shops appears in every one, destroying the character
acquired by individual towns over centuries to conform to a pattern
predictable from Aberdeen to Aberystwyth.
Edinburgh's Gyle centre is regarded as a great disappointment by
people who thought they were going to have a new choice of shops but
discovered all the leases were taken by names already well-established
in other parts of the city.
''People thought they were getting another Metro centre, but there is
nothing they cannot visit elsewhere. Now all towns of more than 30,000
population have 80% of the same shops. It is well-known that all the
main high street names will move into a new centre as soon as Marks &amp;
Spencer signs a lease,'' said Steve Burt.
Even more depressing is his observation that once they have signed a
lease, the conglomerates will swop different parts of their empire into
the unit to reflect local demand or the population profile at large. The
most common example of this phenomenon is the Burton Group's gradual
replacement of Top Man and Top Shop with Burton, Principles or even
Evans outlets.
Maybe the last is a direct result of all the eating that goes on in
malls. In a technique borrowed unashamedly from the traditional
department stores, they offer a choice of eating places at the top or
the bottom of the building, ensuring a passage through the variety of
wares on display. The food hall or food court is no longer where you buy
the ingredients for the meal you cook and eat at home, but where you
consume the meal before doing more shopping -- or possibly browsing.
No-one laments the passing of individual department stores more than
John Glass of the shopworkers' union Usdaw. ''When I started in this
business there were 25 Frasers stores in Scotland. Now there are five
and it's well-known their owners are only interested in Harrods.''
While recognising that the days when rival names faced each other
across the shopping thoroughfares of Scotland's major towns as well as
cities and you were marked as surely as a branding iron by the emporium
which supplied your winter coat, Burt is confident that the remaining
flagships will survive if they adjust their strategy to the new market
place.
''There will always be a Jenners. There will be a Frasers in Glasgow
and probably even a McEwan's in Perth, but none of them will be the
store with every department from ironmongery to fresh food and
electrical goods. John Lewis is the only one which still fits that
pattern.
''We will probably see more concentration on clothing, particularly
the well-known labels and traditional styles favoured by older
customers, and household goods. The most striking example is Debenhams
which is concentrating on textiles with clothing concessions within its
shops and on household goods like bedding and towels. The food and the
hardware are out,'' he added, ''It is also interesting that they have
been moving in and out of the electrical market in recent years but seem
likely to concentrate on small items as they are supplanted by
out-of-town electrical stores such as Comet for things like fridges.''
If such white goods' morgues are supplanted in turn by an electronic
catalogue and a promise to deliver in seven days it will seem little
loss, but even the quickest visit to a mall reveals the need to touch,
test and try shoes, silk shirts, sandalwood soap.
The anthropologist's end of century view of the human ant hill will
still see shopping as the perfect sociological cross-section.

* IF you're buying a washing machine, video recorder, or other
expensive household item this weekend, beware the salesperson's
blandishments to take out an extended warranty. They're a scandalous
waste of money, according to the latest issue of Which? magazine. It's
scarcely surprising when customers are pressurised, typically, to fork
out more than #200 for a five-year warranty on a washer-dryer when one
third goes to the retailer in commission. But there's only a one-in-six
chance that even the least reliable applicances will break down more
than once in the four years after the initial one-year guarantee expires
-- so you're likely to save money by not buying an extended warranty,
says Which? And it cites the case of a Dixons' customer who was urged to
pay #25 for a guarantee on a pair of binoculars, only to find that the
makers included 10 years' free cover.
Land rovers
* THERE'S free grub for volunteers ready to help the National Trust
for Scotland with weekend conservation schemes. Anyone between 16 and 70
can apply to join Lothian Conservation Volunteers and learn countryside
skills such as drystane dyking, footpath construction, woodland
management, and fencing, with the opportunity to make new friends and
work alongside rangers and naturalists. If you missed out on the Glencoe
litter sweep last weekend, don't despair: more are planned. Projects are
also being lined up at Ben Lomond, Ben Lawers, Brodick and Grey Mare's
Tail and other venues over the summer months. Contact the National Trust
for Scotland on 0131 226 5922.
Going potty
* ALWAYS a haven for great and groovy kitchen ideas, Habitat is
expanding its Cookshop range this spring to encourage customers to be
more creative in their home kitchens. The new cookware range includes
stainless-steel, cast-iron, enamel, and aluminium non-stick pots, pans,
and warmers, poachers, and steamers, griddles, balti, Chinese woks,
funky fondues, barbecues, and bakeware. They haven't forgotten you need
somewhere to store all this and there's an imaginative ranges of new
containers.
Walk on by
* DOG owners are invited to take a lead in the SSPCA's campaign
against cruelty by joining sponsored dog walks. Forty walks are being
organised throughout Scotland as part of National Pet Week (April 29-May
8). Dogs must be vaccinated and kept on a lead at all times. For
information call Pauline Mullin on 0131 225 6418.
A smash hit
* GO TO work on an egg this Easter with a Heitmann egg-colouring kit
to create a basket full of brightly coloured hard-boiled eggs, or blown
eggs to decorate an egg tree. The colouring kits cost around #2 and an
egg blower is #5.50. On sale at W H Smith and Paperchase and art and
craft shops.

Make a date
* AN exhibition of stipple engraving on glass runs until April 15 at
Whytock and Reid's showroom at Sunbury House, Belford Mews, Edinburgh.
Members of Glasgow and District Embroiderers Guild have 80 items on show
in a Stunning Stitching Exhibition in the Mitchell Library, Kent Road,
Glasgow from April 10 to May 20. The Oil-Pickled Fossils of Messel, an
exhibition about mammal evolution after the dinosaurs died out, is at
the Royal Museum of Scotland, Chambers Street, Edinburgh until May 7.
Pot luck
* IT MAY be time to draw a line through the linear school of interior
design -- after the swing towards all those cool and simple (and
somewhat spindly) Scandinavian styles, the chunky feel is making a
comeback. Galerie Mirages (Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, and Great Western
Road, Glasgow) is running an exhibition over the next three months
promoting the ethnic approach -- so prepare to make space for sturdy
village pots from the Atlas mountains, hard-wearing jute rugs from
India, and textiles from Mali, Morocco, Ghana and Zimbabwe.

AFTER reading the article on April 3, Ruined builder attacks
developers, I would like to ask Mr Graeme McKinstry, the lawyer acting
for Mr Ferguson, if it is so easy to start a limited company then why
did his client not also do so?
While I sympathise with Mr Ferguson I also have to ask why he let a
bill for #66,000 run up in the first place before seeking a payment.
The comment, ''If you or I wished to borrow money we would have to
give security, but technically if we started a limited company with #100
today we could be running up debts of a million next week'', is
nonsense.
Directors of limited companies can give personal guarantees to any
creditor and in effect Mr Ferguson did lend out #66,000 to the
developers without proper assurances and guarantees.
Not sound business practice at all.

I READ with interest Ian Strathdee's letter on making arbitration
attractive by adopting and including arbitration procedures into
standard forms of construction contracts (March 25).
While this may be a step in the right direction, I do not believe that
this strikes at the heart of the problem in the Scottish construction
market. Even with an installed and agreed procedure, arbitration is not
viewed by sub-contractors and medium-sized construction business in
Scotland as the most effective way of setting a dispute.
Try telling a sub-contractor with a relatively small turnover and
increasing pressure to stay afloat in the current market that the only
way of settling his construction dispute is going to arbitration and as
such he will need a fistful of dollars to actively pursue or defend his
case over a long-term period before he is any further forward in
reaching a settlement.
The heart of the problem lies in the construction contracts,
especially between main and sub-contractors. The terms are far too
onerous, the contracts are weighted towards the bigger party in the
agreement and in essence it is the rules and procedures of the
construction contracts that need to be drastically revamped to protect
the parties entering into agreements.
The bullying of sub-contractors is now ever-increasing and we have
come across many cases where cash and construction contracts are being
held up to sub-contractors simply through the onerous conditions of the
contract.
Surely it is about time that the construction industry realises that
simple legal forms of sub-contract standard throughout the industry are
required to protect the parties and allow disputed matters to be settled
quickly and efficiently through other dispute resolution options, such
as compulsory mediation and/or alternative dispute resolution.
Arbitration to the working classes of construction is as outdated as
the complex form of sub-contract that are thrust upon them in order to
compete in the market and this is the problem that must be identified
and resolved. A better and more structured form of arbitration would be
attractive to larger national contractors who have the time and money to
devote to such a mechanism, and even have the resources to devote to the
archaic process of presenting either side of the dispute.
This does not suit the smaller contractors and the thousands of
sub-contractors in the market and things will not get better until there
are simple standard forms of sub-contract governing the work carried out
in the Scottish market-place.
There is no doubt that current procedures, with the time and cost
obligations, are crucifying what is left of a debilitated market.

IN A recent interview programme concerning certain innovations
introduced during the current rating revaluation of non-domestic
property, Mr George Kynoch, the Junior Minister concerned, attempted to
justify the introduction of the rating of empty property in Scotland as
being fair because, first, it brings Scotland into line with England and
secondly, any hardship caused to individual owners will provide grounds
for a claim for relief of rates.
How many times do we have to witness good Scottish legislation being
replaced by poor English legislation solely on the grounds that if
certain rules apply to 90% of the population they must be superior to
those applicable to the remaining 10%?
As it happens, this particular English provision has justifiably been
under sustained attack by both business and property interests south of
the Border for many years.
It was first introduced following a period of high inflation which
caused rapid growth in rentals. The Government suspected that certain
empty properties in London, notably the newly built Centre Point, were
being intentionally withdrawn from the market so as to obtain the
benefits of significantly higher rentals in the future, and this
provision was intended to penalise the owners of such properties.
Whilst the circumstances behind the introduction of this legislation
did not arise in Scotland, the rating authorities have had discretion to
change rates on properties which have remained empty for a period
exceeding six months.
These authorities have seldom, if ever, exercised this discretion
because they have accepted that owners in Scotland have invariably made
every effort to let or sell empty properties.
The new legislation will be mandatory and will require rating
authorities to impose 50% rating after three months on selected
categories of empty properties regardless of the efforts of owners to
let or sell them. The effect will be particularly iniquitous during
periods of recession when many properties lie empty for long periods
because no occupiers are available.
It is inevitable that some owners of empty properties will attempt to
render them incapable of occupation by removing services and by other
devices to attract a nil valuation. Are we back to the days of bricking
up windows to avoid taxation?
In 1956 the Government introduced with great acclaim their major
review of the rating system in which the brightest star was the
abolition of owners' rates in Scotland. What has changed their minds?
The Minister's response on the question of hardship has dumbfounded
commercial ratepayers and rating authorities alike. There is a statutory
provision to enable a rating authority to relieve a ratepayer of all or
part of the rates charges if he is likely to sustain hardship.
When local authorities are so vociferously complaining of being
strapped for cash is it likely that they will voluntarily grant relief
of rates to owners when the legislation governing this iniquitous
imposition of rates on empty properties has been intentionally amended
by the Government from discretionary to mandatory?

THE Chamber of Commerce has spoken (April 3). It has commended the
Glasgow Development Agency's scheme for the former Glasgow Garden
Festival site, not on its merit, but because it thinks GDA can make it
happen and that it is ''bold and ambitious''. That boldness -- the
Science Centre, Imax, Universarium and Tower -- depends on Millennium
Funding of #39m and will also need considerable revenue funding.
But the Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 proposal is bolder and more
ambitious, involving the acquisition and development of a 90-acre site,
including the Govan Dry Docks. This is regarded as the best plan by the
Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland.
If our #50m bid for Millennium Funding is successful our scheme would
make a far better setting and be just as likely to happen as the GDA's
scheme. It will not require revenue funding.
Both schemes combined would give Glasgow a chance of being chosen as
the site of a Millennium Festival. An announcement is expected in the
spring on where it is to be in the UK.
If for any reason the GDA's application for funding is abortive, then
Miller Developments will apparently only have a multi-screen cinema
funded and possibly business premises to follow in due course.
Millers may buy the site from the Scottish Office, and what a ''mess
of pottage'' Glasgow will then have paid for its birthright.
Better that no planning permissions were granted until the potential
of the two Millennium Fundings are decided. Who knows, we may eventually
get the best of both applications.

MAY I express the gratitude of the Willie McRae Society to John
Macleod and Nic Outterside for their essays in investigative journalism
to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the death of Willie McRae?
During that decade this society has tried, without success, to obtain
a Fatal Accident Inquiry. That is our raison d'etre. We simply want to
know the facts. A disdainful response from the Crown Office we can
accept, despite the politeness of our questioning.
Perhaps we are deemed unworthy to be entrusted with the truth, but
when the (then) Solicitor-General appeared to change the script in April
1990 his action tended to augment rather than diminish our disquiet.
Hence our welcoming of your investigation.
The Willie McRae Society is not alone in stating its interest. Mr Len
Murray, a former trainee and partner of Mr McRae, is described (March
29) as a ''distinguished criminal lawyer with a first-rate forensic
brain''. He is currently writing a book, an excerpt of which you have
printed.
Our society will be pleased to assist Mr Murray with his material
where we can, for I have counted four errors in the first paragraph of
his article. In the first line, he got the date wrong.
The comment, ''His (Willie's) was an extreme brand of Nationalism,''
is patent nonsense, and Mr Murray's assertion that ''the extremists
formed the Willie McRae Society'' is in equal parts mischievous and
mendacious. I wager Mr Murray #100 that such a statement is completely
untrue. Nor does a consequent assortment of flimsily-based assertions do
credit, in my opinion, to ''a first-rate forensic brain.''
As Mr Murray must know, Mr McRae stipulated in his will that there
should be no ceremony, no memorial at his funeral. Consequently the
Willie McRae Society dedicated the cairn to all patriots in our history
who fought and died for the Scottish cause.
We believe that Willie McRae was motivated not by party-political
creeds, but by truth, integrity and compassion, and that's may be why
his vitality and charisma seem as influential today as they were 10
years ago.

ANOTHER charity changes its name (March 29). It appears to be widely
believed that a change of name for a charity brings with it an inherent
magical quality whereby the coffers become filled with gold.
As a charity whose name was changed, I am happy to report that our
branch income in Glasgow has in fact increased. This is due to
determination and commitment which have overcome the difficulty of the
change of name and lack of recognition.
It is a fact of life, I'm afraid, that the public's retention of
recent change and its ability to relate new with old is a slow process,
16 months on we still receive mail address to Birthright.
Under our former name, we were well-known as the charity of the Royal
College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the charity of the
Princess of Wales. For this reason, where possible, we retain the words
''(formerly Birthright)''.

CLIVE Turner of the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association uses
unsupported statistics to attempt yet another attack on the credibility
of ASH (March 24). He and his paymasters seem to lack the insight which
would prevent them from doing themselves what they criticise in others.
I do not wish to ''dance up a storm'' about Mr Turner's interpretation
of the relevance of the ASH data on cigarette sales to people under 16.
However, it would be more honest of him to say rather than smoking
amongst youngsters under 16 is ''regrettable'' and that tobacco
addiction acquired at this age is likely to lead to serious illness and
a painful death.
When Mr Turner and his association begin to own up in public to the
consequences of using the drug which they sell, it is then that we may
begin to look to them for some semblance of objectivity.

REACTIONS to statistics are sometimes more important than the figures
themselves. The manufacturing output figures for February are a case in
point for they showed only a modest improvement in January, which
nevertheless confirmed that the recovery is still the salient fact of
economic life. Opinion, however, seized upon the fact that when
considered alongside the comparable figures of the previous two months
there was relative standstill rather than anything akin to a surge. In
one of these paradoxical situations, which may even seem perverse, that
was taken as good news. The outcome was seen as offering proof that the
economy was responding to the increases in bank base rates (imposed by
the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England) with the aim of
slowing growth to a level thought to be sustainable and
non-inflationary. If the figures are taken in that context they suggest
that there need not be another immediate increase in base rates (and
thus money costs for all borrowers including mortgage payers) before the
middle of the summer. One may still be avoidable then, but most
commentators think that another increase is likely, though it should
prove to be a peak from which rates will then start falling well into
next year.
The underlying position might also continue to operate against dearer
money because of the fiscal sqeeze which has strengthened this week with
the various tax charges provided for last autumn coming into operation
only now. If people do not have the actual cash to spend they cannot
spend it, and the manufacturing industries will continue to benefit from
export orders (enhanced by the currency movements which have
strengthened the mark but weakened sterling, so making British goods
cheaper). Domestic demand will not therefore surge itself to attract
output away from foreign markets where selling is always more difficult.
Only a renewed resort to personal borrowing would alter that picture but
it is hardly likely when the costs of doing so are so high. Someone
might tell the banks that their desired returns from lending to
consumers are far too high, in real terms, to generate enthusiasm, at
least amomg numerate customers. Others who might take on the burdens in
spite of monetary calculations still seem to be deterred by uncertainty
as to their own continuing employment, even though the national total
still seems to be falling. The case for not anticipating any sudden
runaway in consumption is reinforced again by the latest evidence from
the housing market where prices are static to falling.
This remains an attractive scenario, but the attractions are not
extended to the mass of voters whose earnings and spending power alike
remain subdued. Eventually a breakthrough will occur. Investment in
manufacturing has risen by a tenth over the past year, so that improved
domestic demand may appear without straining capacity and squeezing out
exports. Not all of that investment is locally generated -- as the car
industry will remind us quickly, there is a lot of inward investment --
but much of it is native and it has been taking place. The Government's
problem -- no doubt highlighted again by yesterday's electoral evidence
-- is that all this seems far removed from what people feel. No matter
the actual figures, it is how they are perceived which is politically
significant.

THE traditional advice for solving a dispute in which both sides are
in the wrong, and obdurate to boot, is to bang heads together. This is
obsolete in the case of the fisheries dispute between the European Union
and Canada because quite enough head-banging has taken place already.
The arguments continued yesterday with the EU in high dudgeon, Canada
exhibiting barely-controlled fury, and Britain wearily gathering support
from Sweden and (possibly) Ireland for an attempt to control the worst
excesses of EU posturing. In what was a distinctly unedifying day,
ranging from the malodorous Spanish attack on the Canadian embassy in
Madrid, to a notably unproductive meeting of EU fisheries ministers in
Luxembourg, the cause of commonsense, not to mention fish conservation,
went into retreat. It is true that some progress had been made in
discussions. A draft text was agreed between EU and Canadian officials
in Brussels and it had been hoped that the document could be presented
for ratification to foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday. Various
aspects in the draft, including the exact dispensation regarding the
share-out of a quota, had still to be finalised but all of this
difficult work may now be undermined by yesterday's events.
The exact truth of what happened in international waters off Canada
early yesterday morning may never be known as all parties have different
tales to tell. The Spanish insist that Canadian patrol boats tried to
board two of their fishing vessels and cut the nets of another. The
Canadians deny any such thing, though appear to admit that one of their
patrol boats manoeuvred close to the stern of a Spanish vessel. The EU
in general calls the incident harassment and condemned it in a statement
bearing the name of the French presidency, while Britain sensibly
refused to acknowledge the incident without more proof and Sweden asked
for further time to consider it. The action of Britain effectively
torpedoed an official EU statement, and in the long run this might turn
out to be a blessing. Anything which is capable of taking the heat out
of this unwelcome squabble is welcome and, just for once, Britain should
be congratulated for being the odd-man-out in the EU. It is interesting
that Sweden should take a cautious line on the issue and heartening that
a new member government is prepared to study the details of a case
rather than indulge in a Gadarene rush to judgment.
Ireland, as one of the countries likely to suffer from the attentions
of the Spanish fishing fleet in the future, is displaying a pleasing
schizophrenia on the Canadian issue; indeed Ireland is turning to face
in all directions with such rapidity that her officials must be
suffering from vertigo. Ireland backs the EU's criticism of Canada's
actions, backs Britain's call for less tough-talking, and backs the
Canadian stance on conservation and management of stocks. If there was a
Bolivian position on the issue, Ireland would probably back that as
well. In the meantime, what is needed is a cooling of the whole affair.
It would be helpful if Spain refrained from sending fishing vessels to
the area until an agreement is reached. Canada should also look again at
her law claiming jurisdiction in international waters and should
acknowledge that her own fishermen are heavily responsible for the
depleted state of some of the fish stocks in the region. Britain,
wearisome though it might be, must continue to wear an unaccustomed halo
and persist in restraining the excesses of all sides.

ON the day when the Queen named a German-built ship which had sailed
into Southampton for the occasion, and prounced it really to be a
British ship, I happened to be addressing the annual meeting of the
British Marine Equipment Council, who are obliged to take a more
practical view of such matters.
It was the first time they had asked a Labour politician to speak to
them. Like many other industrial bodies, they are becoming very
interested in what we have to say. That is both symptomatic and welcome.
The learning process is entirely two-way.
As on all such occasions these days, I had a chat afterwards with a
longstanding Tory who told me that he had just torn up his membership
card and, in this case, resigned as vice-chairman of his local
association. It is at gatherings like these that one can really gauge
the extent of Tory meltdown and the feelings of utter disillusionment,
often crossing over into open contempt.
These are people who have battled through recessions and tides of
false wisdom about the irrelevance if ''sunset industries'' to keep
businesses afloat. They have fought for, and won, export markets to
replace the business which has disappeared in British shipbuilding
communities. They believe in engineering skills and the primacy of
manufacturing in any successful economy.
It is a tribute to their efforts that, although the Oriana is
German-built, 75% of the equipment on board is British -- lending some
credibility to the Queen's proclamation. If only they had a flourishing
home market to sell into, everything would be hunky-dory. But they
don't, largely because of the free-market madness which decreed that
cheapest, in ships and everything else, was best.
They complain that Britain, of all countries, has no coherent strategy
for its maritime industries, far less a transport policy which would
give due place to coastal shipping. They look in vain for incentives
which would encourage ship owners to build and to build British. They
protest when the Scottish Office, in commissioning a new fishery survey
vessel, gives the design (and probably construction) contract to Norway.
While there is precious little respect paid by the present-day Tories
to the great art of making large and useful ships, the ability to make
money is exalted and admired. And there is plenty of money to be made on
the waterways of Britain without a finger being soiled on anything so
vulgar as shipbuilding and engineering.
Just ask the multi-millionaire directors of Clydeport, under the
command of Mr John Mather. We now know that, in addition to being sold
#53m worth of public assets for #11.6m, they promptly recouped #11m of
that outlay by flogging the Braehead site to Marks and Spencer. This is
the kind of enterprise which modern Toryism believes in.
As a reward for their cleverness and connections, the Famous Four
became owners of shareholdings now worth several million apiece. The
company is now valued at #70.5m and managed to clock up a profit of
#4.2m in its first year of privatised operation. Hardly surprising,
given the original selling price.
For newcomers to this story, it is perhaps worth recalling the
sequence of events. In 1991, Mr Mather and Co (with the help of Allan
Stewart, MP) tried to promote private legislation in order to privatise
themselves. For this purpose, the assets of Clydeport were valued at
#52.9m.
The private Bill was then overtaken by Government legislation, which
proposed that -- since nobody supposedly owned the Trust ports -- the
new owners would pay a ''levy'' to the Government, half of which would
revert to themselves. So, once this became law in 1992, the assets of
Clydeport were mysteriously valued at #26m. Half was given back to the
new owners, who were also compensated #1m for the inconvenience of
having promoted private legislation.
Then, last December, the valuation of Clydeport -- by now privatised
and ready for flotation -- was magically restored to #54.8m. Since then,
the value of the company has risen sharply to the current level of
#70.5m -- more than six times what it was ostensibly privatised for, or
more than 120 times, if you allow for the Braehead bonanza.
These millions could have done a lot for the Clyde and its traditional
industries, instead of going into the private bank accounts of the
little clique who sit in splendour by the Broomielaw. Give me the people
who build ships, value engineering, and fight for orders any day of the
week. That is a judgment which is now very widely shared, and it helps
explain why the Tories are so despised in circles where they were once
secure.

THE report of the Ayrshire sub-contractor who it appears has been
ruined by a development company represents the human face of the
personal anguish faced by so many genuine sub-contractors who, after
having completed works and incurred expenditure, have been denied
payments that have been due to them (April 3).
The report shows the ineffectiveness of the courts in this matter as
the sub-contractor had actually pursued the legal path and obtained a
decree for some #66,000 plus legal costs but all to no avail.
The development company simply walked away from their responsibility
and all the sub-contractors and their suppliers are left to share the
debt incurred by that developer.
For some, like the Ayrshire builder, it will be the last straw and all
that they have worked for will come crashing about their ears, with some
forfeiting their homes and their life savings.
In the meantime the Government has issued yet another consultative
document, Tackling Later Payment: Stating Payment Policies in the
Directors' Report, but I have to say that no matter how this document is
read it would not have prevented the tragedy that has hit the
unfortunate Mr Ferguson.
Given that the Government issued a consultative document in 1993 on
late payment of commercial debt and patently refused to accept the views
of the majority of those who responded, could I very cynically suggest
that it will continue to issue consultative documents until it gets the
answers it wants?

For many of the 3000 American prisoners on death row, execution will
be seen as an escape from the mental anguish of years spent fighting a
lost cause, yet others will cling to the faintest of hopes until their
dying seconds. While death is seen as the ultimate penalty for crime,
the long wait for the almost inevitable is its own agony, and for
Nicholas Ingram, given an eleventh-hour stay of execution last night,
the agony continues
THE gruesome ceremony of frying to death in Old Sparky, Georgia's
prosaically nicknamed electric chair, may be a slow, brutal way of
killing condemned prisoners. For Richard Dieter, who visits men waiting
to die, the execution is merely the grisly finale to the ritual torture
of years spent on death row.
Dieter is no sad-eyed liberal. He is the hard-headed executive
director of the Death Penalty Information Centre in Washington DC. It
does not campaign against capital punishment. It focuses on the problems
of the death penalty, producing academic research on its effects, in the
last advanced democracy that still executes criminals.
With cool academic detachment, he describes the usual decade of
stunted life spent fending off a statutory death as the real hell.
Death, he says, is often viewed as release.
The length of time from sentence to execution in America is an average
of eight years. The courts are slow in deciding appeals. They take their
time to be sure that everything is covered, he says. For British-born
Nicholas Ingram this meant spending 12 years on death row within the
euphemistically named Diagnostic and Classification Centre in Atlanta.
He was convicted of the murder in 1983 of an elderly Georgia man
during a bungled robbery. Cambridge-born Ingram tied the man and his
wife to a tree then turned a gun on the terrified couple. The woman
survived to testify against him and he was sentenced to death on his
20th birthday.
The methods used to put a prisoner to death were clinically described
by Jacob Weisberg in an academic treatise on modern ways of execution in
the journal New Republic.
After being led to the death chamber in white pyjamas, the prisoner is
strapped to the chair with belts across his legs, groin, chest, and
arms. A leather mask covers the head and chest and a wired copper dome
covers his shaven head. A copper electrode is attached to one leg, a
patch of which is shaved to reduce resistance to electricity.
To increase conductivity and reduce burning, the electrodes are either
soaked in brine or treated with gel. The executioner gives a first jolt
of 2000 volts, which lasts four seconds. This is followed by two further
surges.
Weisberg reports that although all methods of execution can be
botched, electrocutions go wrong most frequently and dramatically, in
part because the equipment is old.
At least five have gone awry since 1982. If the current is too weak,
the prisoner roasts to death slowly. This happened in the May 1990
execution of Jesse Tafero in Florida. Witnesses said that when the
switch was flipped, blue and orange flames sprouted from both sides of
the mask. The power was stopped and Tafero took several deep breaths. It
took two more jolts to kill him.
Weisberg says there is some medical debate about what the electrocuted
prisoner experiences before he dies. Willie Francis, a 17-year-old who
survived an attempted execution in 1946, gave a first-hand account: ''My
mouth tasted like cold peanut butter. I felt a blurring in my head and
left leg and jumped against the straps.'' He was successfully executed a
year later.
For Dieter, the awful paraphernalia of judicial death is merely the
culmination of a long, slow process of vengeance: ''The death penalty is
one thing. You can view it as barbaric, but that time on death row is no
kind of life. That's why some of them give up, insist the appeals stop,
and want the execution to go ahead.
''It's the psychological torture of waiting and knowing you are going
to be killed.''
He cites the case of Thomas Grasso, convicted of murder and
incarcerated in New York. After three years he insisted on being sent
back to Oklahoma for execution. He died in the electric chair two weeks
ago.
The time on death row, held in a cell typically five feet by nine
feet, kept in isolation, allowed out twice a week for a shower or a walk
round the yard, in penitentiaries miles away from family, amounts to
sensory deprivation, Dieter argues.
''The period of waiting is severe agony. Most of the appeals a
prisoner files he will lose. There is this process of continual
disappointment, that and the almost certain knowledge that in the end
you are going to be killed. Few people walk off death row and live. It
means living scared for years. It's a form of torture, maybe not
intentional, but it is torturous.''
Emotional abhorrence of the grim rituals of vengeance is one thing.
Incontestable facts are another. There are some 3000 people on death
row. In the 38 states which have the death penalty, there have been 252
executions since capital punishment was reintroduced in 1976. That's a
lot of people waiting a long time to die.
The electric chair is the method favoured in 12 states, where it has
dispatched 112 people, compared with 127 killed by lethal injection. The
gas chamber, employed in seven states, has been used to poison 10
murderers, while hanging has been used twice and a firing squad once.
To date, 11 offenders with mental retardation have been executed, nine
men have been executed for crimes committed as juveniles, and there are
currently 39 death-row inmates sentenced as 16 or 17-year-olds.
Studies found most prisoners on death row are of low education, a high
percentage are found to have head injuries, indicating physical abuse as
children. A high number suffer mental illness or mental retardation.
About 40% are black.
Race, says Dieter, is often the main determinant of execution. A
review of death penalty sentencing by the US General Accounting Office
found that in 82% of cases the race of the victim was found to influence
the likelihood of the death penalty. In other words, those who murder
whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murder
blacks.
In July 1989, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that holding
people on death row in America for average periods of eight years before
execution amounted to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment.
Authorities in Virginia had asked for the return of a German national
called Soering on a capital murder charge. The British Government was
about to ship him back to the US when his lawyers petitioned the court
in Strasbourg.
The court's decision was not based on the fact of the death penalty or
the prospect of his execution. It was the length of time for which he
would have been held which was the deciding factor.
The UK Privy Council, the last court of appeal for Jamaica and a
legacy of its colonial status, ordered the release of death-row inmates
who had been held for as long as 20 years in the overcrowded Kingston
jail.
It ruled, in the case of Pratt and Morgan, that long periods waiting
for execution amounted to cruel and unusual punishment: ''There was a
lot of debate a couple of years ago among scholars as to whether they
could use that in America to argue that the psychological stress was so
unbearable it breached the 8th Amendment of the American Constitution,''
explained Dr Pat Lucie, a lecturer in American law at Glasgow
University.
The trouble with arguing that it is wrong to keep people on death row
for years, she points out, is that conservatives may use the argument to
push for swifter execution. It is a paradox which is not lost on Dieter.
''That is the contradiction in the death penalty; the tension between
the state interest in not making a mistake and preserving an innocent
life by taking time, and the interest of the prisoner in staying alive.
''People in America want execution as a form of retribution. Unless
that changes, there is always going to be this tension.''
He points out that the case of Nicholas Ingram has aroused little
interest in America. ''There are two people a month executed. Unless
there's something very special about the case, it's just another bad man
dead in most people's eyes.''

A pregnant woman in a coma after a road accident is being kept alive
in an attempt to save her baby. But, with 10 weeks to go before the
child will be full term, medical staff face a difficult decision
THE birth of baby Battenbough was all set for celebration in mid June
-- a much-wanted child after a series of miscarriages. Instead, it is
almost certain that the baby will be delivered by Caesarean operation
within the next seven to 14 days -- at least eight weeks premature --
and the mother allowed to die.
Karen Battenbough, 24, breathes without aid and continues to nurture
her child, being given enough liquid and protein food for the baby,
which continues to develop normally. The young nursing-home care
assistant has been diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state,
giving the appearance of being asleep although unable to wake up. She is
said to have ''virtually no chance'' of surviving the serious head and
spinal injuries she received when the car she was travelling in was in
collision with a bus near her home in Swansea. That accident was six
weeks ago when she was four-and-a-half months pregnant.
Dr Andrew Lyon, consultant neonatologist at the Simpson Memorial
Maternity Pavilion in Edinburgh, outlined the difficulties facing the
doctors caring for the mother and unborn child: ''The dilemma in Wales
is getting the balance right. Obviously every extra week in the mother
gives the child a better chance of survival, but the fact is that even
if you maintain the mother if there is brain death there can be
deterioration of the body and then the doctors will just have to cut
their losses and deliver the child.
''The worst scenario would be if something were to happen to the
child. I certainly don't envy them their decision. Another factor is the
stress on the relatives if the pregnancy is allowed to continue full
term. I think the doctors will give it another week or two and then
deliver the child by Caesarean.''
Dr Lyon points out that if the baby -- it is not known whether the
child is male or female -- were to be delivered even now, 10 weeks
premature, it will have a 90% chance of survival.
A full-term baby is born at 40 weeks but, according to Dr Lyon, birth
from 37 weeks is perfectly normal. Babies which are eight weeks early,
or more, bring with them increasing problems and those born after 28 to
32 weeks of pregnancy would all be admitted to special units, only
around half of them needing full-blown intensive care.
''Mortality at 22 weeks is virtually 100% but with just one week more
the success rate is somewhere between five and 10%. A child born
prematurely at 24 to 25 weeks has a 40% chance of survival, at 26 to 28
weeks 60% to 70%, and after that the success rate runs well into the 90%
range,'' says Dr Lyon. Males, for reasons not known, fare less well than
female babies.
Mrs Battenbough, says Dr Lyon, will be on a course of steroids to help
produce in her baby the substance surfactant which is vital for the
function of the lungs. Premature babies, he says, are not good at
producing it.
Of the stress of coping with cases such as that of Mrs Battenbough,
who is being cared for at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, Dr Lyon says:
''We all have a degree of training and in intensive care death and great
emotional problems are by no means unknown. There is always close
support for staff and relatives.''
The ethical issue of keeping a terminally injured mother-to-be alive
for a considerable number of weeks solely to improve the chances of a
successful birth were yesterday addressed by Ian Baillie, director of
the Church of Scotland's Board of Social Responsibility. ''There is not
an easy answer here -- not a right or a wrong. We start from an
indeterminate point and medical staff do not have a 100% certainty. But
we would support the medical view that where there is a chance, that
chance should be taken. We would support anything that would give that
chance a better hope of survival.''
On the anguish of the husband, 30-year-old Michael Battenbough, who
has been spending seven hours a day at the bedside of his unconscious
wife, Mr Baillie said: ''The Church has also to think of support for the
husband and that, surely, has to be what is best for the child.''
A spokesman for the Catholic Church said in Glasgow: ''Briefly, the
Church's guidance is to save life but we do not believe that doctors are
obligated to take unusual steps to do so. In this particular case in
Wales it seems perfectly proper for the mother to be aided to save the
child, even though she may later die.''
A high level of nursing skill will be required to maintain Mrs
Battenbough in a condition in which she can benefit her unborn baby.
According to June Andrews, Scottish board secretary of the Royal College
of Nursing, the techniques needed are well understood. She points to the
case of Tony Bland who was kept alive for four years.
''We have got that side of it cracked. When it comes to the emotional
aspect of caring for someone who is, for all normal purposes, dead we
cope by working on the assumption that they will, some day, come round.
We try to make things as pleasant as possible for them, maintain their
dignity and comfort, regard them as a personality. We think in our head
but behave in our heart.''

Mary Brennan on why jazz dance is stepping out
WHEN Scottish choreographer Sheridan Nicol agreed to head up the
National Youth Jazz Dance Festival, she put a time limit on her stint as
its director. Three years, was what she said -- mind you, that was five
years ago . . .
This year, she reckons, she can step down. Or maybe bring in a
co-director. Because this year she has realised a main goal -- the
festival has, at last, been recognised, and funded by the Arts Council.
Edinburgh-based Nicol however, is under no illusions about the extent
of this particular breakthrough. ''They still don't know what it's
actually about,'' she said briskly. The history, the fact that so much
American choreography has roots in jazz dance, the influences -- it's
just not known about.
''You go to meetings, you outline projects -- residential courses,
schools workshops -- and folk sit, rubber-eared. They haven't a clue.
Maybe now ballroom dancing's become an Olympic sport they'll see other
dance forms in a different light, who knows.''
But even if funding bodies have never heard of Lester Horton -- one of
the first American choreographers to appreciate the challenging variety
of jazz rhythms -- they can see for themselves just how popular
musicals, like Five Guys Named Mo, are with the public.
So, gradually, NYJDF has gained ground across Britain. This summer
there's a week-long residency in Liverpool. Meanwhile, next week the
Easter course is running in Glasgow, at the Community Central Hall in
Maryhill.
Some 30 youngsters, ages ranging from 10 to 18, will spend four days
working on different styles with various guest teachers and
choreographers before inviting the public to watch the results in All
Our Jazz next Thursday.
It's quite an action-packed timetable for the participants, some of
whom are travelling from London just to work with teachers like Lorraine
Le Blanc and Jackie Bristow and in the company of bright young
performers, JazXChange Music and Dance Co.
Nicol has already run one education project -- in among a host of
other activities that recently included directing the Eden Court panto
-- and would be keen to do more. But then, that's the attitude that
shifted the goalposts at NYJDF the typically elastic enthusiasm that
turned a three-year commitment into five -- and still counting.

Mrs Wood teaches techno. Be happy to learn, says David Belcher
IN this now-a-go-go pop world, there are DJs and there are DJs. One
lot of DJs babble with self-preening inanity on daytime radio. They
grooveth not, neither do they tap into the vibe. For them, music is
background noise, and Michael Bolton's preposterous haircut epitomises
stylish understatement. These DJs are rightly despised, even by the
lowest of the low: sex-criminals, lawyers, and Tory politicians.
Contrastingly, the other DJs -- the ones spinning late-night vinyl in
clubland -- are the coolest figures in the youth-culture firmament.
Stoking the global dancefloor furnace, they have been this decade's most
functional music-industry superstars.
Their names are legion. Paul Oakenfold. Andy Weatherall. Sven Vath.
Danny Rampling. Graeme Park. Mike Pickering, now a double Brits winner
with M People. Pete Tong, currently a presence on Radio 1. Gonzalez and
Vega. John Digweed. Justin Robertson.
Amid this list of revered names there sits an odd one: Mrs Wood. Mrs
Wood belongs, and yet she doesn't. So who is Mrs Wood? And is it correct
that she has forsaken the role which first brought her to prominence? To
wit, has Mrs Wood stopped being a teacher of techno?
Mrs Wood is actually Jane Rollink, a no-nonsense Yorkshirewoman from
Barnsley, where they don't call a shovel anything fancy . . . they just
pick it up and sodding clout you with it, twatty. Her nom du turntable
is a silly-sounding joke which, for that precise reason, stuck. She'll
next be in Scotland a week on Saturday among the DJ'ing team for the
Rezerection Easter all-nighter at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston.
Jane first emerged nationally 18 months ago with an album she'd
compiled for the React label, Mrs Wood Teaches Techno, techno tunes then
being what she played in clubs. The album's large-scale sales success
got her on to Channel 4's Big Breakfast alongside Chris Evans, but while
she still likes the record, Jane now plays what's best described as hard
house.
''It was a slow evolution,'' she says. ''I'd got bored with the same
old beat. Some folk play fast trance, and that's it, everything out of
the same biscuit-tin. I've a broad taste in music but, whatever I play,
it's from the heart.''
Northern soul, punk, and industrial art-noise were closest to Jane's
adolescent heart, accelerating her sense of alienation from Barnsley's
humdrum mainstream and propelling her towards London, where she started
off running a grubby b &amp; b and ended up overseeing the daily routine of
a record label, Some Bizarre, and its major star, Marc Almond.
''I'd always been behind the scenes, but five years ago a friend
opened a one-night-a-week club, FF, and asked me to DJ. I'd never even
seen two decks together before, and I couldn't stop shaking while I was
on.''
She's been a regular at FF ever since, her hard-edged choice of dance
music being a natural progression from that ground out in the early
eighties by such uncompromising acts as Einsturzende Neubaten and Test
Department. ''I'd never been into what was then called dance music,
soppy soul that was too bland.''
The antithesis of bland, Jane has assembled two React singles of her
own, The Awakening and Whodunnit, a pair of generic hard-house
tub-thumpers. She is at present working on an album with her ''musical
interpreter,'' Kevin White. ''Kevin reads my mind because I don't play
anything. I wish I could . . . having played trombone in the school
orchestra isn't much use for capturing ideas in the middle of the night.
I want the album to be listenable more than danceable, like
Leftfield's.''
Additionally, under the VW monicker, Jane has done a single with
fellow-DJ Rob Vanden, Easter Island, as well as ''an optimistic,
poppy-techno sure-fire top-10 hit with Marc Almond called Shining
Brightly''.
Otherwise, Jane's week divides into three nights of club work --
Friday, Saturday, Sunday -- with most of the rest of her time being
spent looking after her 16-month-old son, Chester. Although Jane has
DJ'd in Israel and spins her sonic web in Aberdeen at Skank every six
weeks or so, the ties of motherhood have precluded her from assuming the
jet-setting itinerary common to top male DJs. If this is Monday, I must
be at a Goan beach-party . . . or a solar eclipse in the Andes . . . or
on Ibiza.
''I breast-fed Chester every three hours for the first seven months. I
had a friend who'd wait outside clubs for me with him in her car. In
fact, at the last Rezerection all-nighter I did a set between my heroes,
Joey Beltram and Dave Angel, and got mobbed on the dancefloor when I'd
finished, which was bizarre and embarrassing and very nice all at once.
''But it wasn't as strange as having gone straight from complete
silence feeding the baby, into a horde of 7000 screaming people, and
then back to complete silence with the baby again. Breast-feeding is
definitely something men should experience. Bloody men.''
Some bloody men DJs and audiences can be less than supportive. ''I've
been looked down upon for being a woman, but it's more for playing the
wrong type of music. 'What the hell is she doing playing techno? This is
breakbeat jungle!'''
Naturally, Jane adopts a bluff Barnsley stance on the issue of DJs
being acclaimed as stars. ''It's a funny one. I felt a bit of a hoax
when I got all the credit for Teaches Techno . . . I'd only compiled it,
not made the music. DJs just play records, and we're very lucky to get
people at the best point in their week, when they're out for a good
time.
''People come up and say: 'You made my night!' It's good to have given
them such a big release, although it's obviously negative if clubbing is
all they do. In this world we need an escape every so often, though.
Ideally, you want them to form an armed militia and march on Downing
Street, of course. But people aren't like that.''
So march purposefully to the Arches on May 20. On that date Mrs Wood
makes her Glasgow debut, reuniting with Test Department's Angus Farquhar
to provide an uplifting post-performance party mood in the wake of
Angus's latest NVA creation for Mayfest, Stormy Waters. Mrs Wood: she
teaches. Be happy to learn.

WHERE once, years ago, Bob's devotees hissed ''Judas!'' when he was
crossing new artistic frontiers of his own devising, last night the more
leg-weary among them were marking the quieter songs by impatiently
bellowing ''Sit down!'' at those who were standing and obscuring their
view.
Socio-cultural resonances there, I reckon: too many Dylanologists like
to sit down and appreciate his music, not live it or feel it. Bob
himself no longer sends out socio-cultural whatsits now, of course. No.
These days we have REM for that kind of malarkey.
In 1995 Bob keeps his head down and gets on with leading a capable but
undistinguished band. They rock pleasantly, like anyone can; they Dylan
all too rarely. But that wasn't the worst of it.
No. The worst of it was a rigorously de-tuned Stuck Inside Of Mobile
(With The Memphis Blues Again) and a version of Simple Twist Of Fate
wherein Bob sounded like Noel Coward with a bad cold, locked inside a
cupboard. My friend, who likes a nice drop o' ambient, fell asleep.
But then again, the good bits easily cancelled out the bad bits,
keeping everyone awake. And the good bits occurred whenever Bob and Co
went acoustic and drummer-free, and you could hear him being nasally
authentic, deft, and devil-may-care. He sang Mr Tambourine Man like he
meant it, whatever it is he means, and he sounded both resigned and
mocking, which is probably rock'n'roll's coolest attitude. Ditto It's
All Over Now Baby Blue and the encore, It Ain't Me Babe.
Bob Dylan? He's on the good foot.

IF there is a key limitation of this adaptation of Nancy Brysson
Morrison's 1933 novel, scripted by Colin MacDonald and directed by Kenny
Ireland, it is simply that it feels like an adaptation.
In many ways it is an enjoyable production, drawing out -- at least
for last night's typically generous free preview audience -- an
unexpected strain of deadpan character comedy from Morrison's brooding
story about adolescent passions and thwarted romance, although in the
end, I don't think so much humour suits it that well. Even if the paying
public turns out to be more temperate, Ireland plays it rather too much
for laughs (witness the cat that leaps from the wedding table into the
wings) and as the story's melodramatic flourishes build up, there's an
uneasy sense that we're laughing at it, not with it.
But more than this, we seem to lose the poetic depth of the tale, even
as its emotional thrust survives. Some early scenes have a Chekovian
stillness about them, but are otherwise thin, lacking in substance or
subtext. Elsewhere the show does scant justice to Morrison's vivid and
pervasive descriptions of the ever-changing landscape of the Scottish
Highlands. Most surprisingly we miss much of the linguistic
precociousness and erudition of the three central sisters, although they
are played with warm and witty grace by Harley Loudon, Simone Lahbib,
and Alice Bree.
At its weaker moments the adaptation trivialises the novel, reducing
it to a banal story of misplaced love; at its most poignant, as when Ian
Cairns's comically austere minister falls foul of Muriel Romanes's
steadfast Nannie, it has the power to touch and engage.

THE General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will be asked to
support the creation of more jobs at decent rates of pay.
The Church and Nation Committee, in a report to the assembly, asks it
to express concern over ''the increasingly short-term, poorly paid, and
insecure nature of employment and re-affirm the desirability of secure
and satisfying jobs''.
The committee asks the assembly to make it clear that all employees
should be independently protected in the workplace and that employment
protection law should apply equally to short-term and full-time workers.
It also requests that the Church lobby the Government to ''reduce the
pressure on individuals to accept humiliating levels of pay'' and to
replace the present inadequate system of social security benefit.
The report contends that paid work remains central to the well-being
of individuals and communities and more thought needs to be given to
ways of properly remunerating various kinds of work.
It warns that if the rules are unfair, then competition may be morally
indefensible and destructive.
The report says: ''There is still a need for systems which protect
people from exploitation and there is concern that, with the
fragmentation of workforces and the growth in part-time jobs, there is
little protection against the excesses of the market or the actions of
unscrupulous and uncaring employers.''
The committee also records its concern about the role of young men in
Scottish society faced with poor job prospects and unable to establish a
family or afford adequate housing.
It claims that the rise in suicide and violent crime among young men
is symptomatic of a worrying diminution in the traditional male role.
The report asks: ''Are there ways of tackling the problem other than
by devoting even greater efforts to employment initiatives?''
The committee concludes that it is essential the Government becomes
involved in initiatives to create well-paid jobs, particularly in
response to the effects of defence cuts.

SEVEN hundred probationary constables throughout Strathclyde are to
participate in a Home Office-sponsored research project into how police
recruits deal with sudden death.
Details of the pioneering work were released in London, when
Strathclyde's assistant chief constable (personnel) William Rae received
a #6450 grant from Home Secretary Michael Howard.
Mr Rae said the project represented valuable research into an
unexplored area of occupational health. Its outcome could lead to the
creation of new training techniques nationwide, to help inexperienced
officers cope with involvement with murder and accident victims.
The work represents a joint leadership programme involving police
officer David Thomson, inspector-in-charge of operational training at
the Oxford Street training centre, and Dr Margaret Mitchell of Glasgow
Caledonian University's psychology department.
Superintendent David Gardiner, project liaison officer, said:
''Dealing with death and dead bodies is among the biggest fears voiced
by probationers setting out on their new careers.''
At present, formal training for adult trainee officers, whose ages
range from 19-40, concentrates on the procedural and practical side of
dealing with sudden death.
This can involve sealing off a death scene, recording a victim's
details and those of witnesses, or removing a body to mortuary.
However, many of the recruits may never have seen a dead body before.
Over the next 12 months, the project team plans to discover the
trainees' experiences in dealing with sudden death, in order to identify
possible gaps in current training procedures.
Superintendent Gardiner added: ''We want to know how well we are
preparing our probationers for dealing with death, which can confront
them from their earliest days in the police service.''

A BAN on a Scots shoplifter from every shop in England has been upheld
after the woman admitted stealing #1250 of clothing from two York
stores.
Kate Logan, a 39-year-old bus stewardess, of Emerson Road,
Bishopbriggs, stole skirts and jackets worth #1000 from a branch of
Fenwicks last April.
She also accepted blame for the theft of jackets valued at #250 from a
store called Browns.
Judge Jonathan Crabtree, sitting in York Crown Court, endorsed a ban
on Logan already imposed by magistrates at a previous hearing.
The ban forms part of the bail conditions accepted by Logan, who has
been freed for a month while reports are prepared.
She has 25 previous convictions for offences committed in Stirling,
Kilmarnock, Edinburgh, Glasgow, the Isle of Man, Falkirk, Carlisle,
Warrington, Blackpool, Coventry, and London.
The judge felt that, given the number of Logan's shoplifting
activities, a blanket ban covering every store in England right down to
a corner shop was appropriate.
When challenged by defence barrister, Mr David Bradshaw, that the ban
was ''unworkable and impracticable'', the judge admitted the prohibition
''might not work'' but insisted Logan would be brought back to court
should she break the bail condition.
She has also been banned from entering the City of York and has been
ordered to report weekly to Bishopbriggs police office.
Logan, who has been warned she faces a prison sentence for her
offences, can still shop in Scotland and Wales. She refused to comment
as she left the court.

<HEADLINE>Oil spill exercise turns into real-life emergency after Skye ferry rescues men at dawn.  Six crew saved as tug sinks</HEADLINE>

EMERGENCY planning experts were given a taste of real-life drama
yesterday during a mock oil-spill exercise.
They turned up for work to discover that a tug carrying 50 tonnes of
diesel had sunk near Kyle of Lochalsh. The six crew members were rescued
by the Skye car ferry, which responded to a Mayday signal.
Last night it was estimated that 30 to 40 gallons of diesel had
escaped from the tug, Flying Childers. Two men were sent to the scene
from the BP oil terminal at Nigg, Easter Ross, and were due to meet up
with locally-based council staff.
The Marine Pollution Control Unit sent 400 metres of boom equipment,
skimmers and sorbents from Stirling to help clean up the spill.
Members of Highland Regional Council's emergency team were in the area
for a computer-generated exercise, simulating a 1000-gallon oil spillage
off the north-west coast.
They were joined by coastguard officials, environmental agencies and
wildlife experts to monitor the effects of a ''spillage'' from a bunker
in Inverness.
Mr Brian Downie, Highland region's emergency planning officer, said
the exercise went ahead as planned yesterday, but the team also
monitored the threat of pollution from the Greenock-based tug. He said:
''After the tug hit rocks, it did lend reality to the scenario we had
put together.
''We put the details of what had happened to the tug into the computer
to anticipate any possible dangers. It did make people realise this
wasn't make-believe.'' He added that the released diesel in the tug's
fuel tank was expected to evaporate quickly.
The tug was on its way to Loch Ewe, and apparently hit a rock or small
islet near the shore and sank around 4.30am. The Caledonian MacBrayne
ferry, Loch Dunvegan, picked up the crew, who were uninjured. The Skye
ferry is due to be withdrawn in six months after the opening of the new
#23m Skye bridge.
On board the ferry, which operates all night, were two local policemen
who were returning to Skye to begin their day-shift. They watched the
tug sink in 20ft of water before taking statements from the six crewmen.
An investigation into the incident will be carried out by the tug
owners -- Clyde Shipping -- the Department of Transport and marine
accident investigators.
The tug captain, Mr Jimmy Barr, 59, of Glasgow, was praised by
coastguards for carrying out a ''textbook operation''.
Mr Barr said last night: ''It was foggy all the way up the coast after
we left Greenock at 11am on Wednesday. But it was clearing as we
approached the Sound of Kyle. We were on our way to Loch Ewe for a job
for Nato.
''I had just gone on watch when the engine-room began shipping water.
I alerted all the other guys and tried to head the tug for the nearest
island. But I knew we weren't going to make it, so I ordered everyone
off.
''There was no panic. We didn't even get our feet wet, thanks to the
ferry. We are very grateful to the ferry crew for responding to our call
so quickly. In fact, I went back on board with the coastguard to collect
the radar, radio equipment and other valuable stuff before the tug
sank.''
Coastguards marked the position of the sunken tug so as not to affect
the navigation of other vessels. Mr Barr's fellow crewmen were Mr Bill
Garner, 60, from Johnstone, Renfrewshire, and Mr Robert Campbell, 52, Mr
Eric Blakely, 53, Mr Hugh Boyland, 51, and Mr Dan Reid, 52, all from
Greenock.

CONSIDER this. If one of your loved ones died in an accident and you
were unhappy about the explanation there would be nothing you could do
to insist that a public inquiry was held. If an English friend or
relative suffered the same fate, even if the death occurred north of the
Border, the coroner would be obliged to hold an inquest.
Is life cheaper above a line between Berwick and Carlisle? Are the
Scottish legal authorities right to believe they are so infallible that
no public check is necessary? Why should grieving relatives be denied
the answers that would help them come to terms with loss?
Eddie McColm of Stevenston in Ayrshire pondered all these questions
after his father was knocked down in July 1989. A disabled war veteran,
James McColm was walking home after a pint and a game of dominoes at a
local masonic club when a taxi ran him down on a straight stretch of
well-lit road. He died in hospital two days later.
Maybe he lurched out on to the road and the driver had no chance to
react. Maybe. But there were inconsistencies in the story -- the side of
his body which took the impact seemed wrong, the evidence suggested he
was crossing in the wrong direction to get home. His sons wanted
justice. Above all, they wanted answers. Instead they met a wall of
official silence.
Eddie and John McColm are engineers, not lawyers, but they embarked on
a confrontation with the legal authorities which continues to this day.
''I just want to get a sense of justice being seen to be done here,''
said Eddie last night.
He is a solid example of why those in power should never patronise
people. ''I now know the 1976 Act backwards,'' says McColm of the
legislation governing fatal accident inquiries. Don't doubt it. He
senses a deep unfairness and is not going to give up.
Early efforts centred on efforts to see all the paperwork relating to
the accident. These were deemed ''confidential''. The next stage was to
demand a fatal accident inquiry. This, they were told, would ''not be in
the public interest''. The brothers decided they wanted to put the
accident in context. How many accidents had there been in Ayrshire that
year, how many had resulted in prosecutions, or FAIs, or decisions to
close the files and mark them ''no proceedings''?
IT became a dogged fight over statistical detail, in which they
enlisted the help of their then MP David Lambie. He plugged away, as did
his successor Brian Donohoe. Journalists wrote stories, the Crown Office
fended off questions, and the issue fizzled out. But not as far as the
McColm brothers were concerned.
Five months ago Eddie wrote to every Scottish MP seeking support in
changing the legal anomaly which he described as ''peculiar to Scottish
law and alien to democratic principles''.
He wrote: ''Secrecy has become a way of life in the Crown Office. It
is very convenient, for it can cover up stupidity, ineptitude,
inefficiency, bad decision-making, bureaucratic bungling, and possible
dishonesty and corruption. It provides the Crown Office with a
comfortable defence against having to be accountable to ordinary men and
women.''
Of Scotland's 72 MPs 45 responded, many of them favourably, to his
argument that an FAI should be a right for next of kin. In January the
Lord Advocate defended the system in a letter to concerned MPs.
One irony was that this reply specified that under the Act autopsy
reports and witness statements should remain confidential, except where
an FAI was authorised. Eddie McColm points out that in the case of his
own father's death this was breached when Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
gave such details in the Commons in 1992 -- a case, he argues, of the
law-makers breaching the law.
He believes the authorities are on the run. He has discovered that the
Crown Office is currently conducting a survey into the treatment of next
of kin. He wants its findings made public. In a powerful condemnation of
the secrecy generated by the Lord Advocate's discretionary power, he
speaks on behalf of families of accident victims.
''How do they know whether the police have carried out their duties
correctly if access to their report is denied? How do they know if the
fiscal has investigated effectively? And, ultimately, who can judge
whether the Lord Advocate has fulfilled his duties?''
It's a sound principle. The most powerful should be the most
accountable. Six years on or 10 years on, at Westminster or in a
Scottish Parliament, change should come, and when it does we should
raise a glass to the actions of Eddie and John McColm and to the memory
of their father.

CAMPAIGNING to restore the role ofPowderhall Stadium in Edinburgh as a
greyhound racing venue and to ensure its future as home track of the
capital's speedway side, the Monarchs, will take on a higher profile
from today.
Dog owners and trainers, along with speedway fans, met last night in a
social club within yards of the stadium gates, which are still
surmounted by the slogan Home of Scottish Greyhound Racing, to map out a
plan of action.
They have been waiting to find out the identities of the newly elected
councillors they should target in their bid to save the stadium site
from commercial or housing development by its new owners, an off-shoot
of an English property company, Charlotte Twenty-One Ltd.
The action group, Hands Off Powderhall Evermore, or Hope, will be
distributing petition forms from today.
The Monarchs have been advised that they can complete the speedway
season at Powderhall but the greyhound racing fraternity has been told
that ''the dogs'' will never run there again and has been left without a
local track.

IT isn't often you find me patting the back of the Automobile
Association. Of course, there have been moments in my life when I've
been glad to see the man in the yellow van, but they were some time ago.
Cars work better these days. Car technology has so improved that the
emergency call-out becomes more and more a hypothesis. Why subscribe to
a rescue service which, in the average life of the average Astra, you
will probably never need?
Disentangled from the jump leads, however, the AA have grown noisily
political, defending the rights of car-owners and, by definition,
promoting the land-grabbing needs of road-users. Their team colour may
be sunshine yellow but you would not call them Green; except, for their
own purposes, on the matter of road-signing, and on this one I'm on
their side.
The AA and I are not happy about the Scottish Office's plan to
deregulate tourist signposting. We have different reasons for being
miserable, although I don't quarrel with their contention that
''information overload'' on traffic signs is a road-safety hazard. That
apart, my own objection might be riskily described as aesthetic.
We live in a land already gripped by roadsign dementia. In Scotland,
the local authority which has taken roadside information to its pottiest
extreme is Lothian region, which has blighted the countryside with its
''Call Clarence'' signs. Its giant cartoon lion postures hideously above
the verges on garish billboards, inviting reports of road defects from
passing motorists.
Every time I drive past Clarence I want to use his freephone number
for the following complaint: ''There's a serious road defect on the A90,
as you enter Edinburgh from the Forth Road Bridge. Some vandal has left
an ugly great sign by the road in a dangerous ploy to annoy and distract
drivers.'' The urge, until now, has got dumped in my ''Life's Too
Short'' file, which is the file dedicated to the impotence of private
citizens with public grievances.
Life's too short to play pointed pranks on Lothian region. Nothing I
can say will make them put Clarence to sleep; neither will any
disapproving letter to the nation's tourist boards make them repent the
Big Brown Sign. Driving through the Mearns the other day (near a stretch
of the A90 which also has the largest P signs in the world) I noticed
there is now a Big Brown Sign indicating the presence of a ''Grassic
Gibbon Centre''. I felt grateful, in a negative kind of way, that it
didn't say ''Sunset Song Country''.
Sensible direction signs are one thing, but there's an air of
desperation about the disfiguring commercials of the British tourist
industry, pointing the way to ''tourist trails'' and ''multi-media
experiences'' and ''living'' museums which spoon-feed the visitor
predigested, easily absorbed gobbets of history and culture.
I first became conscious of the more absurd manifestations of the BBS
menace in Yorkshire, where there are brown signs advertising everything
from Old Mother Shipton's Cave (an undistinguished hole reputed to have
been the den of a soothsayer) to Captain Cook Country (a corner of
Cleveland where the mariner was -- wait for it -- born).
Dafter still is Tyne and Wear's claim to fame: ''Catherine Cookson
Country''.Is there no room for distinction in this frenzied labelling
between what are assets to the heritage industry, like New Lanark's
initiatives, and what is merely part of the entertainment industry? With
deregulation it can only get worse.
Mr Ian Lang's statement predicted ''a significant increase in the
number of tourist-related enterprises qualifying for full 'tourist
attraction' signing''; and we're threatened, too, with a proliferation
of symbols and signs to services like pubs and B&amp;Bs.
In continental Europe they do things differently. Not always better,
but differently.
Years ago when I first started travelling in Italy, I was both shocked
and pleased by the nature of its roadside information: the commercial
advertising which corrupted the Renaissance landscapes of Umbria (the
hinterland of Perugia, home town of Perugino, is festooned with
billboards for ''Baci Perugini'', product of the local chocolate
factory) and the helpful habit of naming even the meanest river at its
bridges.
Rivers, unlike some other natural features, have tended to make major
contributions to the evolution of local economies, and deserve to be
named.
We have copied the good idea, now naming our own rivers, and so far
rejected the bad one. We have taken lessons from France, too, which
promotes in eclectic style the principal features of its towns and
villages on staggered, one-category signposts on their approach roads.
''Bienvenue a Oyannax . . . son eglise historique . . . sa piscine
publique . . . son bon marche . . . ses fabriques plastiques''.
We have learned, a little grudgingly, to extend our own welcome to
travellers to our towns (I can remember the days when it was only
available in Gaelic for visitors to Inverness) but even here the
bureaucrats have applied a crazed touch.
On the road between Alloa and Tillicoultry there's a string of tiny
communities, mere clusters of ribbon development, which each has its own
''Welcome to . . .'' sign. Motorists barely register one welcome before
the next is upon them, without opportunity for farewell.
In all this there is more at stake than the hazard of information
overload or the purity of my personal aesthetic for the environment. If
we guide and direct and label and sign to excess, if we process all the
experiences of the leisure traveller through the filter of an authorised
version of what he should be doing and seeing, we risk eliminating the
gene of curiosity from the human spirit.
For every tourist who enjoys being packaged there is one who seeks the
thrill of exploration -- and the number of ''independent'' travellers is
growing. These are the people who have made travel books a tiger economy
in publishing, who do their homework before they go anywhere and who
enjoy reading maps.
They don't want to be taken by the officious, bureaucratic hand
through the highways and byways of Scotland. They want to make their own
discoveries. They solicit serendipity; they relish the unexpected; they
know a good shot from a photo-opportunity, and they can find their own
''Viewpoints''.

A MOTHER and daughter from Edinburgh told yesterday how they
challenged a group of rowdy football fans on a train.
Mrs Paula Cunningham, 49, a bank clerk from Edinburgh and her
daughter, Mrs Sandra Skivington, 26, received a Chief Constable's
Certificate of Commendation award for their bravery.
Mrs Cunningham, who lives in the Buckstone area, intervened after
Hearts supporters, who had been drinking, shouted abuse at passengers
and hit a young Rangers fan on the train from Glasgow in 1993.
''I was just angry that no-one did anything to try to help, even
though there were many grown men there. I just thought that that boy was
someone's son; he could have been mine,'' she said.
''My mother has a temper which makes you know she is boss. I am very
proud of her and I know she would do it again,'' said Mrs Skivington.
Also recognised at the British Transport Police awards were Constables
John Dalby, 39, and Kenneth Robertson, of Edinburgh, who risked their
lives at Slateford Viaduct to save two teenage girls who were
threatening suicide. The officers clung to one girl above an 80ft drop
as a train passed, before leading both to safety in October 1993.
''I was scared but the adrenalin was pumping, it was just instinct to
try and save them,'' Mr Robertson said.

BRITAIN'S newest cruise liner, the 69,000-tonne Oriana, received a
champagne welcome and a royal accolade yesterday as the Queen hailed the
German-built vessel as being ''the best of British''.
''Though built in Germany, she is very much a British ship:
British-owned, British-registered, and flying the Red Ensign. She has
been largely fitted out by British craftsmanship and is almost entirely
crewed by British and Commonwealth seafarers,'' said the Queen.
''She is a reminder that, for all the changes of the modern world, we
have never lost touch with our maritime heritage, and I am confident
that she will make her own history in the twenty-first century.''
To tumultuous applause and a triumphant blast from the luxury liner's
siren, the Queen declared: ''I name this ship Oriana. May God bless her
and all who sail in her.''
Pulling a lever, she sent a magnum of champagne crashing neatly onto
the ''I'' of the ship's name.
The ceremony at Southampton, attended by several thousand guests,
welcomed the #200m P&amp;O flagship into the fleet.
The Queen also met a smaller Oriana -- eight-year-old Oriana Kelly,
who presented her with a posy.
Oriana had written to the Queen from her home in Georgetown Crescent,
Dumfries, and asked if she, too, could go on the ship and have a tour.
Her letter was forwarded to P&amp;O who invited her and her four-year-old
sister, Natalya, and parents, Howard and Judith, to attend yesterday's
ceremony.
''It's nice and my favourite bit is the swimming pool,'' said Oriana.
The cruise liner, which can carry nearly 2000 passengers and 760 crew,
leaves on her maiden voyage for the Atlantic Islands, Morocco,
Gibraltar, and Portugal on Sunday, when thousands are expected to line
the shore to wish her bon voyage.
Built in the Meyer Werft shipyard, she is the fastest liner for a
quarter of a century and has 914 cabins on her 10 passenger decks, the
largest swimming pool of any ship afloat, a West End-style theatre with
a revolving stage and orchestra pit, and nearly 3000 works of art.

THERE we were at the Scottish Exhibition Centre last Sunday. I was
watching Street Football on a blowy and windy day. The wig was rattled,
I can tell you. That was hardly on my heid. I don't know how Bob Mitchum
ever kept his fedora on filming in San Francisco and the like: he must
have been pinned to death with kirby grips.
Anyway, there I was at the Scottish Exhibition Centre on the edge of
the Clyde in Glasgow. And it was windy and cold. But nothing would have
put the wind up you outside more than what happened at the Scottish
Exhibition thingmy. For the SECC is a mere stripling, just over a decade
old, part of the thrust of the new Glasgow.
The venue is shabby and dirty, the carpets would pass for that in a
hostel for the dispossessed of this city. It looks like a palladium for
derelicts. It is an eyesore and I doubt if anything other than
demolition can improve it. It is, as Damon Runyon was wont to say, a
dead wrong gee.
Inside it is a hotel, the Moat House. After the footy match I
approached the hotel to telephone a taxi and have a wee half. The half
cost damn near as much as the taxi fare as it turned out.
The Moat House bar staff are very competent and pleasant, but it is
damned-near empty. Not bloody empty enough though for there were enough
children to make up for the vacancies. Lots of children, mainly girl
ones under six or seven, their daddies and elder brothers outside for
the Street Football. It is not the job of bar staff to supervise
Visigoths aged six: it is the job of the parents.
The children were running about daft, as they say, holding balloons,
screaming with the sort of hysteria which normal parents would tend to
discourage. Every single child was clad in those tights or legging sort
of things, wee skittery legs and bums sliding everywhere, lurid
leggings, retina-splitting colours, just ideal for a later excursion in
adolescence of adventures in anything which is loud. Very loud.
Ear and eyes perforated by the bright colours and brighter sounds
which only chemicals can produce. They didn't look like children at all.
More like some species of homunculi specially created by some satanic TV
producer. The more lurid the colours, the more the children fed off
hysteria. The louder the music, the louder the shrieks. But there are
tears before bedtime. And bedtime is getting dreadfully close. It is
society's bedtime.
Just this week I read a very good piece in a splendid new magazine
called The Scottish Review. It is edited by and mainly written by Ken
Roy, ex-BBC, ex-West Sound, ex-Herald if it comes to that. Roy wrote
about Hanger 13, that Ayr venue for little ones to drop dead in with
heat and exhaustion and dehydration and . . . drugs. Roy took the
trouble to cover the entire two weeks of the inquiry into the tragic
deaths of three young men at this ''rave''.
He stayed there after the media circus had disappeared itself into
murky depths elsewhere. His article was revealing and poignant, or at
least the awful testimony of these young people was touching enough.
One of the young people was asked if he had consumed the pills he
bought. He did not understand the question. Sheriff Gow had to re-phrase
it. ''Did you eat or swallow these tablets?'' asked the perplexed
sheriff. ''Oh, aye'' replied the poor illiterate child. He knew how to
eat and swallow. The bastards who provided him with the tablets knew
what to consume means. Oh, indeed, they knew exactly what the
consumerist society is.
Just ask any taxi driver in any city in Britain where the drugs runs
and drops are. Every cabbie knows them. The police must do as well. At
this moment it is even easier in Glasgow because there is a notorious
fellow who is buying up every sort of business in which it would be easy
to launder drugs money and this man -- who has been charged several
times with murder and been released following lack of evidence -- is
popularly alleged to be laundering enough for bloody Pullars of Perth.
Journalist Roy has become a touch depressed about youth, and no wonder
considering what he saw during that dreadful fortnight when he witnessed
young people incapable of articulacy, wanting ''a good laugh'', no
knowledge of anything other than raves and nihilistic hanging about
corners. But it is not all like that.
PERHAPS because I am not married I find myself in the company of a lot
of much younger people. What I have found over a good few years is that
most young people are very articulate indeed -- perhaps too much the
cheeky wee buggers, if Heraghty's Bar is anything to go by. I don't mean
that. The young lads and lassies I meet every day and night, including,
I may say, my nephews and neices and godchildren and their pals, are all
polite and, within reason, sensible. None of them takes drugs. No
ecstasy, no speed.
I believe them. What I don't believe anymore is parents who allow
their weans to run about without vigilance. In a weird sort of a way it
has got a lot to do with the bright colours on the outside.
Children need the bright colours in their heads. But lucid, not lurid.
Roy is right to be worried. It is now the parents who do what they're
told, and pass it on to their brats.

GOOD morning, Tories. And how are we this morning? Chipper? Upper lips
stiffer than a large plaster cast? That's the spirit.
Given that you might just be feeling a little under the weather, we
thought we could mention that, in a spooky coincidence, while you were
voting, an auction house in San Francisco raised $275,000 from the sale
of items that once belonged to General George Custer. Can't see the
relevance to Sir Michael Hirst? Perhaps if we mention the ''dossier'' he
produced just this week -- Labour's Lousy Local Government Record in
Scotland -- and the press release he issued to accompany the
masterpiece, things might begin to fall into place.
''Of course,'' Sir Michael writes of the People's Party's misdeeds,
''none of this will come as any surprise to the long-suffering residents
of these Labour councils, but it is important that the wider public is
aware of what a vote for Labour on April 6 can entail.'' He adds:
''After Thursday, the next chance to elect your local council will not
be until 1999.''
You would almost believe he couldn't wait, wouldn't you?
Money for nothing
IT IS often alleged some people will bet on anything, but the odds are
that few would think of laying money on the political future of Edouard
Balladur.
Nevertheless, Ladbrokes said this week that British punters -- plainly
accustomed to backing losers -- have been showing their support for the
French Prime Minister's presidential campaign with hard cash.
This is odd enough, given that the French themselves are not so stupid
as to wager on anything as frivolous as politics. What makes it stranger
still is that few people in France really believe that Balladur,
possibly the least interesting man in the Western world, can hold off
his Gaullist rival, Jacques Chirac, come polling day.
The best explanation advanced thus far for this odd phenomenon is that
British gamblers are ''used to a Prime Minister with a reputation for
being boring''.
Pencil terrorists
OBSERVERS of the Middle East peace process will be disturbed to learn
that Israel is once again employing heavy-handed tactics. Just the other
day a crack team from the country's Customs Authority mounted a
lightning raid and arrested 18,000 terrorist pencil cases.
The boxes in question -- made in Red China, no less -- are said to
decorated with a subversive map, cheekily describing Israel as
''Palestine''. A customs spokesman said: ''The shipment is being held up
simply because we believe the material is inciteful (sic)''.
Talks on an international pencil case non-proliferation treaty are
expected at any time.
Monkey business
WE hear from across the Atlantic that Outbreak, Dust Hoffman's new
thriller, is proving to be quite a hit with movie audiences. Less well
known is the fact that most of the credit seems to be due to a 22-inch
capuchin monkey known, imaginatively, as Monkey.
She -- for the simian is a starlet -- is said to have become quite a
player in LA, where the intellectual competition is not notably intense.
Not only does she support Hoffman in the role (hers, not his) of an
illegally imported African monkey carrying a deadly virus, she also has
a big part in the NBC serial Friends, in which she is cast,
mystifyingly, as ''Marcel''.
According to industry sources, Monkey's advantage over Dustin is that
she never asks what her motivation is. Her trainer adds that, unlike her
diminutive co-star, she ''will do anything for an earthworm''.
''If Monkey were human'', says handler Nerissa Politzer, ''she'd be
Meryl Streep''. This may or may not be a compliment, but the
seven-year-old beast is already showing signs of what the Americans call
''attitude'', despite the fact that most of her breed would be happy
enough with the $350 a day she commands.
Hollywood being Hollywood, Monkey's love life has meanwhile attracted
gossip. On the set of Outbreak she embarked on an affair with another
capuchin named Freddy, and subsequently moved in with him. One report
portrays the pair as ''notorious swingers''.
A town called
Hillary
MOST towns do their bit for civic pride, but one in Bangladesh has
taken the drive for self-improvement to desperate lengths. Captivated,
or so they say, by Bill Clinton's wife during a recent visit, they have
now renamed the entire burg after Hillary Rodham Clinton. Thus, what was
Rishi Para is now Hillary Para.
Plans to name the place after the President himself were dropped, it
is alleged, because no-one fancied hailing from Philandering Buffoon
Para.
Hybrid humans
ANYONE steadily going blind in front of a computer screen to earn a
crust will already know how it feels, but the head of research at the US
computer company Sun Microsystems reckons the day of ''hybrid humans''
is not far off.
Michael Deering has told the magazine Computing that
''chip-grafting'', by which humans could be ''hot-wired'' and enabled to
connect their brains directly to computers, is a real possibility.
Plainly the man has never watched an eight-year-old with a Gameboy.
Nevertheless, prisoners in Scandinavia have been persuaded -- by means
as yet unrevealed -- to participate in research to test the theory.
Chips with everything, as the saying has it, but don't blow a fuse.
What we really want to know is whether you plug your convicts into the
mains or run them off batteries.
Wired for sex
STILL with the digital revolution, the thought occurs to us, not for
the first time, that the distinguishing feature of hard science is the
extent to which human ingenuity is applied to producing things which are
not only useless but, in the main, perfectly ridiculous to boot. A CD
player is a marvel of human endeavour; a CD player containing a Wet Wet
Wet disc is a bad joke.
Thus we were somehow unsurprised to learn from the review section of
Wired, the magazine-cum-bible of the on-line world, that a CD-ROM
entitled Video Sex is now available. This 200-page effort is not, as you
might suppose, just a bit of soft porn but a ''guide on how to produce
and star in your very own erotic movie'' with guidance on ''light
bondage, spanking, and . . . out-of-sequence editing''.
Camera-shake is, we understand, the main technical problem.

THE pilot and co-pilot of a North Sea helicopter only just managed to
avoid plunging into the water as they both battled with the controls
after encountering extreme turbulence, a Department of Transport report
revealed yesterday.
The Bristow Helicopters Bell 214 aircraft, which was carrying 15
passengers, was on its way back to Sumburgh on December 6 last year
after two failed attempts to land on the floating oil storage vessel
Petrojarl 1, in the East Shetland Basin, when the incident occurred,
prompting the crew to send a distress signal.
The pilot was forced to send the helicopter into a controlled dive to
try to gain the necessary airspeed to escape the turbulence but then had
to pull back on the control to avoid hitting the water when he saw the
surface of the sea illuminated by the landing light.
The helicopter and crew were based at Aberdeen but were asked to make
the journey from Sumburgh to the Petrojarl because the sea state was
such that the movement on the vessel's helideck was outwith the limits
for the helicopter normally used.
Technical problems delayed their departure from Aberdeen until 3.30pm,
according to the Air Accident Investigation Branch report, when they
made the flight to Sumburgh where they took on the passengers and fuel.
The aircraft left Sumburgh in the dark at 5pm and flew to the
Petrojarl at 2000ft.
En route, the crew noticed several ''small but intense returns on the
aircraft's weather radar display which were about one mile in
diameter''.
As they approached Petrojarl, they identified the vessel on radar and
saw a bright red return to the north of the vessel.
As the helicopter approached, the starboard side to land they noticed
an increase in turbulence and because it would be difficult for the
co-pilot to execute the landing the approach was abandoned.
''He felt slightly uncomfortable during this manoeuvre because of the
air turbulence which also affected the aircraft's pitch attitude
stability,'' the reports says.
The commander took over the controls and approached the vessel's port
side. As he brought the helicopter to hover 50ft above the helideck, the
turbulence, which had been moderate, became very marked and he had
difficulty in stabilising the hover.
As he manoeuvred towards the helideck, the turbulence and helicopter's
movement became violent and the commander decided the weather conditions
and sea state were too severe for a safe landing.
As he climbed away, he felt the rate of climb was lower than expected
and the air turbulence increased in severity.
He was having difficulty controlling the aircraft and there was a
rapid reduction in airspeed and to try to correct the problems the
co-pilot also grasped the controls and they both put the helicopter into
an intentional dive during which the commander transmitted a brief
Mayday message.
''Next he noticed the surface of the sea illuminated by the landing
light and pulled back on the cyclic control to avoid an impact.''
They successfully climbed and within two minutes had cleared the
severe turbulence and landed at Sumburgh at 6.54pm.
Weather details later revealed a cluster of cumulus and cumulonimbus
clouds near the Petrojarl at the time which would have caused very
turbulent flying conditions.
The Chief Inspector of Air Accidents has ordered a formal
investigation into the incident.

THE announcement that jobs are to go at one of Scotland's principal
scientific establishments has provoked an angry response from trade
unions.
Plymouth-based management has offered voluntary redundancy to all 55
staff at the Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory in Dunbeg, Argyll, amid
claims that research standards are falling short of targets.
However, officials of the Institute of Professionals, Managers, and
Specialists (IPMS) -- which represents the majority of the staff -- said
they were amazed at the way with which the matter had been dealt.
The laboratory -- which carries out a range of scientific, sea-based
research -- is one of three run by the Centre for Coastal and Marine
Sciences (CCMS) in Plymouth. The other two labs are at Birkenhead and
Plymouth. CCMS is part of the Government-funded Natural Environment
Research Council.
Mr Jim Cooper, IPMS negotiations officer, said voluntary redundancies
had been offered to staff at all three labs in the UK before Christmas.
That offer was then withdrawn and has now been presented solely to staff
at Dunstaffnage.
He said: ''The irony is that there appears to be a deficit of #1m from
the other establishments. Yet the Scottish lab appears to have been
chosen to bear the brunt of that.''
He said Dunstaffnage had been criticised in a scientific review
several years ago but added: ''If there were problems with the work that
was being done, why has it taken three years to do anything about it?
''We have sought information on this and it has not been forthcoming.
We are amazed at the strange way the whole problem has been dealt with
and are seeking an urgent meeting to find a way forward so that
redundancies are minimised.''
CCMS director, Dr Brian Bayne, said the company had announced a
''state of pre-redundancy'', which would involve attempting to re-deploy
staff and offering voluntary redundancies. He added that compulsory
redundancies could not be ruled out.
He said: ''There has been a falling short of scientific standards in
some parts of the lab.''
He said one area of work, which employs around one fifth of the staff,
was of most concern, adding that three people had already accepted
voluntary retirement.
However, he added that the lab could be integrated into a network of
scientific establishments and universities which could create more jobs.
Dr Bayne said he hoped five new positions would be created at
Dunstaffnage in the future.
He said: ''The labs in England have met their performance indicators,
so are not involved in this part of the exercise.''
He suggested the situation should be resolved in the next couple of
months.
Argyll and Bute MP, Mrs Ray Michie, said the claim that some of the
research at the lab was not meeting the required standard was
''extraordinary''.
''I find that very difficult to believe when you consider the high
calibre of the people who work there,'' she added.

A LIFE-PRISONER who became an expert in neurology, while fighting to
prove he could not have caused the brain injuries that killed his
girlfriend's four-year-old daughter, was yesterday cleared of murder.
The Court of Appeal in London held that, in the light of fresh medical
evidence, Mr Kevin Callan's conviction was ''unsafe and
unsatisfactory''.
Lord Justice Swinton Thomas said: ''It is a matter of regret to this
court that he was convicted in the first place.''
The judge paid tribute to Mr Callan, 36, a former lorry driver of
Hyde, Greater Manchester, and his solicitor, Mr Campbell Malone, for
their ''tireless'' research. The appeal was not opposed by the Crown
Prosecution Service.
There were loud cheers and applause from Callan's family and
supporters in the public gallery as the conviction was quashed.
Hugging his parents, Joan and Arthur, on the steps of the court, Mr
Callan said: ''I am, of course, very relieved to be once again a free
man. I have been in prison for four years convicted of the murder of a
child I love and it has been a devastating experience for myself and my
family.''
Mr Callan was jailed at Manchester Crown Court more than three years
ago for the killing of Amanda Allman by shaking her to death.
He always protested his innocence, insisting that he found Amanda
unconscious in the bathroom and tried to revive her with the kiss of
life. He told the Crown Court he loved the girl and had never lost his
temper with her.
Amanda, severely disabled by cerebral palsy, had earlier fallen
downstairs and from a garden slide, he said, and this may have caused
the two brain haemorrhages identified by Home Office pathologist Dr
Geoffrey Garrett.
The girl's mother, Ms Lesley Allman, stood by Callan, describing him
as a good and ''very patient'' father who showered Amanda and her other
child with affection. Although the couple have now separated -- the
murder trial stopped their wedding plans -- she had supported his
appeal.
The prosecution case was based largely on evidence from Dr Garrett
that the child was shaken to death.
But while serving his sentence in top security Wakefield prison, Mr
Callan, who left school without any qualifications, read every book he
could lay his hands on dealing with head injuries and brain surgery.
He corresponded with experts in the UK and abroad. Dr Phillip
Wrightson, of New Zealand, and Home Office consultant neuro-pathologist
Dr Helen Whitwell, provided reports challenging Dr Garrett's
conclusions.
The CPS then brought in its own forensic pathologist who confirmed
that the girl must have died from her earlier falls.
In court yesterday, Mr Richard Henriques, QC for the Crown, said that,
because of her disability, Amanda had injured herself with ''unfortunate
regularity''.
Dr Garrett, now retired, had since made a statement agreeing that
direct trauma ''is a possibility that merits attention''.
Defence counsel Michael Mansfield QC, said that, although he was not
criticising the police, their forceful and severe questioning of Mr
Callan after his arrest, based on the pathologist's opinion, showed the
dangers of a dogmatic approach to a defendant, who in this case did not
succumb.
Mr Mansfield added that it was another ''sad reflection'' that it took
Mr Callan himself to seek out the expert witnesses who eventually got to
the truth.
None of the experts at the trial was a specialist in neuro-surgery or
neuro-pathology. They were not in a position to suggest to lawyers that
perhaps a specialist should be sought, he said.
Mr Mansfield pointed out to Lord Justice Swinton Thomas, sitting with
Mr Justice Latham and Mr Justice Morison that Mr Callan was originally
refused leave to appeal because it was felt lawyers should not be
allowed to ''trawl for experts''.
Lord Justice Swinton Thomas agreed it was important that in future the
correct expertise should be called in such cases.
He added that, although Dr Garrett had now retreated somewhat from his
original opinion, it would be wholly unfair and against natural justice
for the court to criticise him since he had not been given a hearing.

<HEADLINE>Tory flagship ambitions in Stirling sunk</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>4</EDITION>

<TEXT>
LABOUR inflicted a crushing defeat on the Tories early this morning in
Stirling when they sank what the Conservatives had hoped would be one of
their new flagship authorities. Labour won 13 seats, the Tories took
seven and the SNP two.
The final result was greeted with a roar by Labour supporters which
nearly lifted the roof off the Albert Hall in Stirling.
The Labour leader in Stirling, Gillie Thomson, said: ''It's an
absolutely brilliant result. It's what we hoped for. It's what we
dreamed about but in Stirling you never allow yourself to say that this
is going to happen.
''The Tories thought that by reducing the council tax by a few pounds
that that was the way to win elections. But the reduction in services
and the introduction of charges for almost everything has backfired on
them.''
Labour's outright victory in the most closely contested authority in
Scotland means it is the first time in three elections that a pack of
playing cards will not decide which party has ultimate control.
In 1992 the Tories won the cut with an ace, the parties having tied
the vote at 10 councillors apiece. Four years earlier it was Labour who
came out with the winning hand when they cut the seven of clubs. The
Tories dug their political grave with a two of spades.
The Tories had gone into yesterday's election having been fired up by
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang who said they had blazed a trail with their
work in Stirling which had made them the envy of Scotland.
But last night, as the votes began to be counted, it was clear that
many Tories were extremely reluctant to go down Mr Lang's road.
Labour set the tone for the night when they took the first ward just
before 10.30 when Corrie McChord, the Labour leader on Central Region,
took Ballengeich.
The first shock of the night came when Ian Lambie captured Queensland
South for the SNP. It was the first time the SNP had taken a seat in
Stirling since 1977.
However, the votes continued to go Labour's way and threw up another
few nasty surprises for the Tories. One of the biggest shocks of the
night came when they failed to win the affluent King's Park ward. The
vote had been split by former Tory veteran Colonel Frank Saunders, who
left the party in high dudgeon after being deselected for the last
regional elections. His intervention as an Independent candidate allowed
Labour candidate John Wyles to grab what was a Tory banker.
A measure of how much the Tories' backs were to the wall came when
council leader Keith Harding had to face two recounts in his Torbrex
ward before eventually defeating his Labour opponent by 48 votes.
Later on, the Tory Provost, Patricia Greenhill, went down to her
Labour opponent by 537 votes to 680.
As they went off to celebrate early this morning, one Labour supporter
said the fact that the Tories had failed to take the new council was
poetic justice in the wake of their blatant gerrymandering when
Scotland's local authority map was redrawn. He also said many people had
been upset by the Tories dropping Robert the Bruce from the council's
logo and replacing it with ''silly matchstick men''.
Early today the electorate had a new champion with the Tories, like
their logo, in splinters.
Labour also had a landslide majority in the new Dumbarton-Clydebank
unitary authority.
They swept into power on a 14-seat power base, the SNP taking seven
seats.
Labour were pressed by the SNP in some seats -- John Wailes causing
the biggest surprise by grabbing 890 votes in the newly created ward at
Dumbarton South.
At 22, Mr Wailes is one of the youngest councillors in Scotland.
A politics student in London, he intends to switch his studies to
Scotland so that he can work for the SNP in the new area.
In Balloch, John Gilleece, de-selected by the Labour Party in
Clydebank, was knocked out by the SNP's Ron McColl.
Clyde submarine base shop stewart Jim Flynn took Bonhill East from
sitting councillor Gordon Smillie, of the SNP, who beat him recently in
a by-election in the same area.
The only non Labour/SNP councillor elected in the new authority was
Independent Billy Kemp, who took the Old Kilpatrick seat.
On the new Renfrewshire Council Labour gained control by taking 22
seats out of the 40 contested.
However, the magic 22 figure includes two unofficial Labour Party
candidates.
The Tory vote collapsed. They took only two seats, losing their group
leader Ian Graham. The main SNP threat also petered out with only 13
seats claimed. The Scottish Liberal Democrats took just three.

Labour took control of the
new City of Edinburgh Council last night with a comfortable overall
majority of 10 seats.
Conservatives in the capital were relieved to hang on as the main
opposition in the new council with 14 seats.
The Liberal Democrats won 10 seats but failed to fulfill their hopes
of forcing the Tories into third place.
It was a very bad night for the Scottish National Party in Edinburgh.
It failed to win a single seat on the new council which has 58 members.
The shadow authority will meet next Wednesday or Thursday when it is
likely to elect the present Lothian region Labour convener Eric Milligan
as its chairman.
Councillor Milligan would be expected to become the city's new Lord
Provost when the new single-tier council takes complete control of local
government services in the capital on April 1, 1996.
The present leader of the regional Labour group, Councillor Keith
Geddes, who may become the leader of the Labour administration on the
new authority said: ''Labour speaks for Scotland and it speaks for
Edinburgh. All of us in the new Labour administration must now work
together to take the city forward and ensure a smooth transition in a
year's time.''
The most notable scalp for Labour's opponents was the defeat of
Lothian Regional Council group secretary Paul Nolan by Conservative
district councillor Ian Berry in Duddingston.
Councillor Nolan left the count immediately saying he was ''very
disappointed'' but it was always going to be a hard fight.
Councillor Berry said he had feared he might be edged out but praised
his loyal local supporters.
Tory district council opposition leader Daphne Sleigh who is expected
to lead the Tories in the new council said the Conservatives in the city
had not been wiped out as many had predicted they would be.
The Tories were angry about a local newspaper poll which had put the
SNP in second place in the city.
The final total for the parties in the new council is 34 Labour, 14
Tories and 10 Liberal Democrats
It was a jubilant night, too, for Labour in West Lothian.
The party won 15 seats in the new council putting the SNP into
opposition with 11 and one Tory. The existing council is run by a
minority SNP administration with Tory backing.
Labour campaign organiser Tony Kinder said: ''This is a sensational
victory. If we can win seats from the SNP in West Lothian we should be
taking them right across Scotland.
''This is a vote of no confidence by the people of West Lothian in the
SNP run council.''
The new Falkirk council will come into Labour's control. The party
returned 23 councillors, SNP 8, Independents 3 and Conservatives 2.
Labour currently runs the administration on Falkirk District Council in
a pact with Independents.
In the new Perthshire and Kinross authority the SNP took power by
winning 18 of the 32 seats contested.
Miss Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's prospective parliamentary
candidate for the forthcoming by-election in Perth and Kinross, was
overjoyed.
''We made some wonderful gains and hopes are high across the
constituency that we'll do even better in the by-election,'' she said.
''The Conservative vote has crumbled.''
The Tory humiliation was complete with the loss of Lady Provost Jean
McCormack in Carse of Garry. Conservative administration leader Angus
Baillie also lost to 23-year-old SNP administration leader on Tayside
Regional Council Mr Ewan Dow.

A YOUNG disabled sportsman, who was told he would never swim again
after suffering a stroke, has returned to the pool -- and is to train
again with Britain's top paralympics team.
Mr William McQueen, of Dalgety Bay, Fife, won six medals after taking
part in the Paralympics in Barcelona in 1992. While winning an Olympic
gold in the 50 metres freestyle, he also smashed the world record for
disabled swimmers.
However, But after being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke at the
beginning of 1994, doctors told him to quit.
Against the odds, Mr McQueen confounded medical advice by returning to
swimming earlier this year and is set to compete again at the highest
level.
The 25-year-old could represent his country in pistol shooting in the
Olympics in 1996 if he is not fit enough for the swimming events. He
took up the sport when he feared he would never swim again.

THE battle by the Kirk to assert its right to administer its affairs
free from the jurisdiction of the civil authorities has intensified,
with Dumbarton Presbytery issuing a strong defence of its conduct in the
case of Clydebank minister, the Rev Tom Logan.
Following receipt of a letter from Mr Logan's lawyer, the presbytery
took the unusual step of publicly asserting its independence from the
civil courts and re-affirming its appointment of a minister to act in Mr
Logan's place while he is under suspension.
Lawyer Colin Cameron wrote ''unless the presbytery withdraws the
appointment of an interim moderator, we will proceed to the Court of
Session prior to Friday (because) the presbytery has not honoured the
undertaking given by its counsel.''
Since then, Mr Cameron has said he did not intend to return to the
Court of Session as long as the interim moderator had no active role in
Abbotsford Parish.
However, the main protagonist for the presbytery, the Rev John Cairns,
said he knew of no undertaking to withdraw the interim moderator. The
presbytery's statement ''reaffirms the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the church in dealing with spiritual matters, including
discipline, and in particular the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Presbytery of Dumbarton in the case against the Rev Tom Logan.''
The prospect of being taken back to a court which it considers to have
no jurisdiction was being viewed by leading ministers in Dumbarton with
anger and has strengthened their determination to fight the Kirk's
corner.
The moves follow an interim interdict granted by Lord Osborne in the
Court of Session on March 17 against the presbytery, ''freezing'' the
suspension of Mr Logan pending trial, for his refusal to obey a
presbytery ban on activities with the networking firm Amway.
On March 23, the Kirk argued before Lord Osborne the Court of Session
had no jurisdiction over its affairs. He continued the interdict,
promising a written opinion within the next few weeks.
The latest round in the dispute centres on a meeting of the Kirk
Session of Mr Logan's church, Abbotsford, called for this evening.
A Kirk Session meeting was requested by office bearers to deal with
matters not relating to Mr Logan's case, to be chaired by interim
moderator, the Rev Fergus Buchanan, of St Paul's, Milngavie.
The presbytery's statement said that in order to avoid a clash with
the Court of Session and further difficulties between the parties, the
meeting would not now go ahead.
However, Mr Logan said yesterday he was reserving his position on
whether he would try to chair the meeting.

THE second largest pear-shaped diamond yet to come to auction may
fetch #7.5m -- more than any other diamond auctioned -- Sotheby's
announced in London yesterday.
Weighing 100.1 carats, only slightly smaller than the great Koh-i-Noor
diamond in the Crown Jewels, the gem was mined within the past two
years, probably in Africa, Sotheby's said, and the cutting was completed
last year.
The identity of the seller is a closely guarded secret but whoever
buys the stone, at Sotheby's Geneva sale on May 17, will have the
opportunity of naming it.

A HIGHLAND household doubled its chances of having a representative on
the council.
Mother and daughter Shirley and Catherine Brogan, who both stay in the
family home in Inverness, yesterday stood for the SNP in separate wards
for the new Highland council.
Mrs Shirley Brogan again contested the Hilton Ward in Inverness, with
sitting regional councillor Ann Darlington, the Labour candidate who
defeated her at last year's Highland Regional Council elections.
Meanwhile, her daughter, Catherine, contested her first election in
the Raigmore ward. She was opposing two sitting district councillors --
Labour's David Munro and Independent Mario Bernardi -- whose wards
disappear in the new council set-up.
Miss Brogan said: ''It may be the first time I have been involved in
an election, but we have always been a political family.''
Two other households were hoping to maintain their double council
representation.
Husband-and-wife team Iain and Olwyn MacDonald both contested seats in
Lochaber as Independents after a selection row with the Labour Party.
Mrs MacDonald failed to win the Labour selection for the new Caol ward
and yesterday stood against Mr Jimmy Mackay, a Labour councillor for 21
years and former leader of the Labour group on Lochaber District
Council.
Mr MacDonald, the sitting regional councillor for Fort William, gave
up the Labour Party banner after the dispute involving his wife and
stood as an Independent in North Fort William and Inverlochy against
Green candidate Daryl Tarar.
The family groups are completed by Isobel and Alasdair Rhind. Veteran
Independent district and regional councillor Isobel Rhind stood in the
the Invergordon ward, and her son, Alasdair, also an Independent
regional councillor,at Tain.

ONE of Aberdeen's best loved politicians has been denied his ''50 not
out'' by the reorganisation of local government.
At 81, former Lord Provost Alex Collie, MBE, has decided not to stand
for election and will retire as a councillor next year after
representing ''Fittie'' (Footdee) for 49 years.
After his appointment in 1965 as chairman of the links and parks
committee, he helped put the sparkle into the silver city and is best
known as the man who guided Aberdeen to so many Britain in Bloom titles
the city was often banned from entering.
Now that he is retiring, he is prepared to admit that winning the
title so frequently was not simply down to pretty floral displays, but
also a few sneaky tricks.
For a start the judges were accommodated in the Caledonian Hotel in
rooms from which they could look out on the Union Terrace Gardens and
its floral displays rather than in any other hotel with a less
attractive view.
Nothing was left to chance, and even the routes over which the judges
would be driven were scouted so that when a less attractive feature
appeared Councillor Collie, who accompanied them, could engage them in
animated conversation and point out something in the other direction.
It is of considerable pleasure to him to see a reduction in the number
of areas which are best to be avoided in the city. Places such as The
Green, his ''playground'' as a boy, that became run down are being
revitalised and buildings by the harbour which have lain empty for
decades are being redeveloped for housing.
Alex Collie's interest in politics was sparked by his father who was a
member of the Labour Party and he decided to stand for the council
because, as a baker working nightshift, he had plenty of time during the
day.
As a member of the council he was involved in the transformation of
Aberdeen into the oil capital of Europe and he regularly rubbed
shoulders with royalty, but he has no hesitation when asked what the
outstanding moment of his ''political career'' has been Aberdeen FC's
European Cup Winners' Cup triumph in Gothenburg in 1983.
His tenure as Lord Provost in the 80s coincided with the club's most
successful spell, and he attended most of the games in the civic
Rolls-Royce and established a great rapport with the fans.
He often tells how in Gothenburg, before Aberdeen's victory, he was
interviewed for television and as he left the interview room picked up a
couple of match programmes.
As he stood outside waiting for the rest of his party in the pouring
rain with his trench coat covering his chain of office and with his
programmes tucked under his arm one Aberdeen fan mistook him for a
programme seller.
Although the match night was memorable the most emotional moment came
when he stood on the Town House balcony to welcome the Dons home after
they had travelled along Union Street with the cup.
''The atmosphere was tremendous,'' he said. ''Especially the grannies
with their grandchildren. It was my proudest moment.''
Mr Collie, a widower, never misses his daily walk up and down Union
Street from the council chambers, which he has used as his base for many
years. He hopes that even after his retirement he will be able to retain
his links with the council.

LABOUR rolled like a juggernaught through Glasgow last night, sweeping
aside everything in its path.
Two of the surviving Tories on the new authority blamed Government
policy for the party's disastrous showing.
District council group leader Councillor William Aitken said: ''The
Government have to realise that much of present policy is simply not
acceptable to the Scottish people and the people of Glasgow in
particular.''
The much-vaunted challenge to Labour from the SNP failed to
materialise. They were left with one seat, Mosspark, where Kenny Gibson
was returned with one of the largest majorities in Glasgow.
Militant were all but wiped out, with only Tommy Sheridan surviving,
and the Conservatives were left with a rump of three members, having
lost their prized Hyndland seat to Labour.
Liberal Democrats also failed to sparkle, with regional councillor Dr
Christopher Mason being a lonely their solitary standard-bearer so far.
The unpopularity of the Government and the perception of Labour as the
only credible alternative seemed to be the consistent theme throughout
the night.
Out of the 83 Glasgow seats, Labour had taken 61 with a 61.84% share
of the vote on a turnout of 37.4%.
At Hyndland, sitting Conservative councillor, Robert Logan lost by 78
to Labour's Ruth Simpson, ending a career in local government which
began in 1974 when the old councils were first formed.
He put a brave face on his defeat saying he did not blame the
Government but had stood or fallen on his record.
The Conservatives also lost the flamboyant Iain Thomas at Langside
which fell to Labour's Archie Graham by a huge majority.
However, there was good news for the Conservatives at Kelvindale where
Councillor Aitken held on by a small majority of 78 against a strong
challenge from regional councillor, Stan Gilmour.
The loss of council colleagues provoked Councillor Aitken into an
angry attack on Government policies.
''The choice facing the Government is quite a stark and simple one,''
he said.
''They will have to learn this lesson or they will have to face what
many Conservative councillors up and down the country are facing
tonight.''
Veteran Conservative Bailie John Young, held on to Cathcart by a mere
38 votes, beating off a ferocious challenged from Labour's Eileen
Dinning.
Mr Young said: ''They have got to change their policies or they will
lose a lot more voters.
''I think they have got to take note. The people and many, many
Conservatives told us they were not happy. It is no good going around
congratulating themselves. We came very near to a complete wipe-out
here.''
Expected to make a significant dent in the Labour vote in deprived
areas, Scottish Militant Labour failed badly throughout the city, except
in Pollok where their leader, Tommy Sheridan, topped the poll with an
impressive 1019 votes. Labour's Stewart Petrie was second with 769 while
the SNP's Grant Carradine, in third place, could only achieve a
disappointing 333.
Mr Sheridan's mother, Alice, came a poor third to Labour and the SNP
in Govan.
Three Militant district councillors , James McVicar at Baillieston,
Charles Stevenson at Queenslie, and Nicky Bennet at Levernholm, all lost
At Hutchesontown, Militant candidate, Margaret Wallace took third
place with 319 votes, James Byrne of the SNP was second with 443, while
Labour's James Mutter triumphed impressively, polling 777.
Militant's failure in Easterhouse was a particular suprise. At
Garthamlock, Militant could only manage 175 as opposed to Labour's 1180
and the SNP's 325. The situation at Barlanark was even worse. There
Militant polled a meagre 160 -- a poor third to Labour with 1294 and the
SNP with 419.
It was solid Labour in the from the East End. At Carntyne, depute
leader of Strathclyde region's Labour Group, Mr Gerald McGrath, returned
a huge 1338, easily defeating the SNP's David Johnston who polled 449,
while Conservative Candidate, William McLachlan, could only muster 144
votes.
There was a similar story at Calton where Labour's Yvonne Anderson
coasted home with 1099 votes while Andrew McMillan of the SNP polled
284,with Conservative, Frederick Rose trailing a poor third, polling a
mere 72 votes.
The Liberal Democrats were expected to do well in Jordanhill and it
was no surprise when regional counil group leader, Dr Christopher Mason,
polled 1347, just under 50% of the vote, with the SNP in fourth place
after Labour and Conservative.
LABOUR last night swept to victory in the new South Ayrshire
authority.
The authority is along the boundaries of previously Tory-held Kyle and
Carrick council and was one of only a handful of Conservative
authorities.
Sad Tories at the count in Ayr blamed the national slide in popularity
for their dismal performance.

A MAN was killed when part of the roof collapsed in Europe's deepest
mine yesterday.
The accident happened 3600ft below the surface and about three
kilometres out from the shaft at Boulby potash mine near Loftus,
Cleveland.
The 43-year-old miner who died is understood to have been bolting up
the section of roof when it collapsed.
Four men were injured in a roof fall at the same mine 18 months ago.
At the time, there was criticism from union sources of the pit's safety
record, although this was defended by management.

DOCTORS were hopeful yesterday that a pregnant woman who is in a coma
can be kept alive long enough for her baby to be born.
Karen Battenbough, 24, suffered serious head and spine injuries in a
car crash six weeks ago. Although she is comatose and severely brain
damaged, her baby is still growing normally, 25 weeks into her
pregnancy.
Medical experts plan to deliver the child by caesarean section if Mrs
Battenbough, now in a ''stable'' condition, can survive another 10
weeks.
Her obstetrician at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, Mr John Calvert,
said: ''It has been done before. She will have been unconscious for 16
weeks -- but I see no reason why it shouldn't work.
''If she can be kept adequately nourished and oxygenated, then there
is no reason why the baby should not continue to develop and be born.''
Mr Calvert said his only major concern was whether the baby suffered
any significant lack of oxygen at the time of the crash. However, scans
have shown the child is growing normally so far.
Doctors have given Mrs Battenbough virtually no chance of recovering
from her injuries. Although she has been taken off a life-support
machine and is breathing by herself, nurses have to feed her by tube.
Her husband Michael, 30, a care worker with the mentally handicapped,
was maintaining his vigil at her bedside.
He and their seven-year-old daughter, Sarah-Jane, from Mrs Battenbough
first marriage, escaped with minor injuries when the family car he was
driving crashed into the back of a parked bus on a M4 slip road near
their Swansea home.
Mrs Battenbough, who has lost four babies through miscarriages, had
undergone painful treatment to ensure her new baby survived.
''I am hoping against hope that Karen will stay alive until the baby
is born,'' said Mr Battenbough.
''Karen desperately wanted this baby. It will be all I have left of
Karen, except for my memories.''

ROAD improvements in Scotland must not be denied because of concerns
or needs in the congested South-east of England, the British Road
Federation said yesterday.
Director Richard Diment told a conference in Edinburgh that
improvements to key roads are vital to Scotland's economy. He called for
upgradings of the A1 and A74 as ''a matter of urgency''.
Mr Diment, addressing the Institution of Highways and Transportation
conference, said it was nonsense to suggest that a future without better
roads represented a strategy for transport.
He warned 40% of Scotland's motorways could be congested by the year
2000 unless extra capacity was provided. He also argued that it could be
more than 20 years before more than 35 long promised town and village
by-passes are completed.
Mr Diment added: ''Scotland has distinct transport needs that must be
addressed. It would be a travesty if Scotland was denied the road
improvements it needs because of local concerns in the South East of
England.''

THE master of the dredger which collided with the Marchioness in the
disaster in which 51 people died had a record of ''dereliction of duty''
for drinking while in charge of a ship, it was suggested at the inquest
yesterday.
Captain Douglas Henderson offered no response after he was directed by
West London Coroner Dr John Burton that he need not answer that and a
number of other questions from the barrister representing the bereaved
families.
Last week, Mr Henderson, master of the Bowbelle, gave evidence for
just 90 seconds after indicating that he had been advised not to answer
questions which might incriminate him.
He was recalled yesterday after families' lawyers said they wanted to
put questions to him even if he was advised not to answer them.
The allegation of dereliction of duty came at the end of a series of
questions by Mr Terry Munyard, counsel for the families, which Mr
Henderson's counsel, Mr Michael Caplan, had objected to, saying they
were irrelevant to the purposes of the inquest.
Mr Munyard suggested that Mr Henderson had been employed on two ships
by a Danish captain in the mid-1980s.
''Were you dismissed by him after drinking on duty on more than one
occasion?'' he asked.
The coroner said: ''Again, that isn't relevant. He may have a number
of convictions, he may have convictions for drink-driving, but it isn't
relevant to this inquest.''
Mr Munyard said: ''I am suggesting he had a record in the past for
dereliction of duty whilst in charge of the ship due to drink.''
Mr Caplan said: ''I not only make the point that this line of
questioning is irrelevant, I find it objectionable.''
Dr Burton directed that questions should be confined to what happened
on the night of the collision.
Mr Munyard had earlier asked if, since becoming master of the Bowbelle
in May 1989, he had been involved in any collisions or grounding of the
ship.
The coroner ruled that that was not a relevant question.
Mr Henderson was also directed that he need not answer questions about
the condition of other members of the crew, including the look-out that
night, Mr Terence Blayney, who gave evidence during the inquest that he
had drunk four cans of beer at home and four pints in a public house
earlier that day.
Mr Henderson was questioned about a reference in his police statement
to Mr Blayney telling him later that he had not reported a sighting of
the Marchioness just before the collision because he thought someone in
the wheelhouse had seen it.
The jury is expected today to begin considering its verdict and a
possible list of recommendations to prevent a further disaster.

in the North Lanarkshire elections.
The actions of Ian McNeil in standing on an Independent Anti-Mafia at
New Monkland West relegated the Labour Party's Sam McCartney to a
surprising bottom position in the poll. Sandra Cox, standing for the
SNP, was the beneficiary of that split in vote, winning with a majority
of 51.
Even more embarrassing for the Labour Party was the fact that Mr
McNeil polled 69 more votes than his Labour opponent, getting 589 votes.
However, Labour achieved earlier successes, with Monklands District
Council leader Jim Brooks hailing his 714 majority at Shawhead over SNP
challenger Colin Hagerty as a total vindication of his tenure as leader
of the council.
''The people of Shawhead and Coatbridge have spoken tonight,'' said Mr
Brooks. ''Maybe now people will stop making up fancy stories about this
council.''

CHILDREN'S television viewers will not find out until two weeks on
Sunday whether 10-year-old Paul Young, from Barrhead, Glasgow, has
indeed won an award at the 16th International Celtic Film and Television
Festival.
All will be revealed on BBC2's FOT (False or True) programme. Oscar
winner Peter Capaldi, meanwhile, met Paul yesterday after he presented
the festival's Special Jury Award to Narance -- a Small Wonder film
production for BBC Scotland and the Scottish Film Production Fund.

IN the battle for control of the last shipyard on the lower Clyde, the
management team has bowed out.
Mr Bill Scott, chief executive of Ferguson Shipbuilders at Port
Glasgow, confirmed that the offer tabled by himself and three other
senior managers had been withdrawn and that a new player had entered the
bidding.
Mr Scott and Sir Ross Belch, the two men who together led the
successful revival of Fergusons, had been vying to win future control of
the yard.
Sir Ross, chairman of the shipyard's holding company Ferguson Marine,
has proposed that it be taken over by Altnacraig, a shipping firm of
which he is also chairman.
The emergence of a new bidder throws the whole contest wide open.
It is understood the management team were struggling to compete
financially with the proposal from Sir Ross: with the emergence of a new
bidder likely to increase the stakes they had no option but to withdraw.
Mr Scott refused to talk about figures yesterday as he is constrained
by the rules of the Takeover and Mergers Panel. However, his team is
believed to have tabled around #2.5m for the company. Altnacraig is
believed to have offered #3m plus.
Sir Ross said the same constraints applied to him but he confirmed he
was aware of the latest moves.
Ferguson, sold by British Shipbuilders in 1989 with only a skeleton
staff, has taken in more than #100m in orders, most recently a #12.5m
deal to build a North Sea supply vessel, and has just reported record
profits of #1.5m.

ROUND-the-clock shopping at supermarkets could be on its way to
Scotland.
Asda said yesterday it was prepared to open 24 hours a day if there
was enough demand at specific branches.
Tesco may also experiment with 24-hour shopping, although the company
is more likely to introduce 20-hour shopping at certain outlets. It
foresees hours being extended as late as midnight in many supermarkets
in the next few years.
The idea of 24-hour shopping has already been successful in US stores.
The first step for Asda could be one of the company's five stores in
and around Glasgow opening all day and all night before Christmas.
The group has already carried out a similar experiment at a London
branchjust before Christmas.
''It was a trial to see what reaction there was,'' said an Asda
spokeswoman. ''It proved tremendously successful.
''We have 27 branches in Scotland. Opening 24 hours would be where
there was a demand and it may be a possibility.''
Tesco managing director, Mr David Malpas, believes a move to 20-hour
shopping is more likely than 24 hours in the short term.
''We will listen to our customers and if we see a clear demand we will
consider opening for 20 hours,'' said a Tesco spokesman.
Like most of the big superstores, Tesco stores are now open until 8pm
or 9pm on Thursdays or Fridays. However, there is a growing demand for
even later opening, Tesco has found.
''Opening to 10, 11, or even 12pm is something we might well see in
the next couple of years,'' the spokesman said.
Sainsbury and Safeway have no plans for 24-hour opening.
However, whichever group tries it, it will not be the first. The shop
chain Spar, which has 2200 outlets in the UK, already has 24-hour
opening in Scotland.
The Spar store in Roseburn Terrace, Edinburgh, is so far believed to
be the only branch in Scotland opening day and night, seven days a week.
The demand has been triggered by big service stations opening 24 hours
a day and offering everything from freshly baked bread, burgers, and
chilled drinks to pet food.
''We have been open 24 hours a day for five months in Roseburn
Terrace,'' said a Spar spokesman. ''It is going very well. We believe we
are unique in opening seven days a week, every day except Christmas.''

STEROID drugs, formerly used to ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis
but abandoned because of side effects, have made a comeback to bring new
hope to sufferers of the disease.
Doctors have discovered that corticosteroids, if used early enough in
doses too small for pain relief, may nevertheless curb the progress of
the underlying condition itself.
The discovery was announced in Glasgow yesterday, at a conference of
the British Society of Rheumatology.
Dr John Kirwan, of Bristol University, described a trial mounted by
himself and colleague Dr Margaret Byron, which showed that daily doses
of the drug prednisolone, equivalent to the body's own production of the
natural equivalent, reduced damage to tissue and bone in joints when
given early in the disease -- before significant joint damage had
occurred.
Patients at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary were among the 128 who took part
in the multi-centre trial, in which all were given the standard
treatment of current anti-inflammatory and second-line drugs. In
addition, half were given prednisolone and half a placebo.
After two years, 46% of the placebo group were developing
characteristic joint damage in their hands, caused when the synovial
fluid sac around the joint swells and spreads, creating holes in the
bone. Only half that proportion, 23%, of the prednisolone group
developed this damage.
One person in 50 will suffer from rheumatoid arthritis at some time in
their lives and half of those will have it seriously enough to require
strong medical treatment, said Dr Kirwan.
Corticosteroids were regarded as miracle drugs when they were
developed in the 1940s and still have an important place in medicine.
Doctors found they could reduce the pain in established rheumatoid
arthritis with escalating doses as high as 30mg but, in the 1950s, they
found that the side effects -- including oedema, high blood pressure,
diabetes, and osteoporosis -- outweighed the benefits of pain relief in
most cases, and their routine use was dropped.
They are now used more sparingly for intractable pain and for a number
of other treatments where the benefits outweigh the risks.
Their use in asthma treatment through inhalers is regarded as safe
because they are sent directly to the lungs and do not get the chance to
cause side effects.
Millions could benefit if Dr Kirwan's treatment is established. He
said: ''This is a real breakthrough. Doctors will want to start their
patients on low-dose prednisolone tomorrow.''
When the two-year trial finished, the treatment was stopped but the
trial remains ''blind'' so that the patients' progress in the third year
can be reviewed.
The long-term risk of osteoporosis was examined by his Aberdeen
colleagues, Dr Clifford Estmond and Dr David Reid, who carrried out bone
scans on their 30 patients and found no evidence of bone thinning.

DRINKERS suffering from gout, who believed that alcohol-free beer
might ease their pain, had their hopes dashed by doctors yesterday.
Scottish researchers have discovered that low-alcohol, and even
non-alcoholic, varieties still reach the parts that other beers put in
agony.
Dr Clifford Eastmond, of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, told the British
Society of Rheumatology conference in Glasgow, that sufferers should
stick to water or orange juice.
Gout is due to an excess of uric acid in the blood and body tissues,
which occurs when people have difficulty in excreting this waste product
through their kidneys.
The acid gathers in crystalline form in the joints, causing pain and
swelling. Alcohol is known to increase levels of uric acid.
Dr Eastmond described clinical trials where four gout sufferers, all
moderate beer drinkers, volunteered to take ''social'' quantities of
beer, vodka and orange, orange juice alone, and alcohol-free beer.
The tests showed that orange juice by itself was the only drink of the
four which promoted the elimination of uric acid. The other three
beverages hampered its elimination.
The villain of the piece, he said, was not only alcohol but other
substances in the beer. They found that both alcoholic and low-alcohol
beer contained substances called purines, which were converted into uric
acid.
If alcohol was the only substance interfering in the metabolism of
uric acid, then they would expect to find higher levels -- produced from
the purines -- excreted in the urine. This did not occur.
''This lead us to believe that the other factors are bittering
substances, known as isohumulones, which give beers their taste and act
as a preservative,'' he said.
One person in 500 is likely to develop gout, either through excess
production of uric acid or difficulty in excreting it.

A SCOTS girl has become a published author by writing a letter to a
girl who died 50 years ago.
Ayr dentist's daughter Sarah Foran, 12, was one of thousands of
children from all over Britain who wrote letters to the Jewish girl Anne
Frank, who died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.
After the war, Anne's diary -- which she began when she was 12 as she
hid from the Nazis in a house in Amsterdam -- was found and published.
The diary became an international best-seller.
Last year, Puffin Books, in association with the Anne Frank
Educational Trust UK, approached schools all over the country and
invited them to ask pupils to write a letter to Anne.
To commemorate her death, Puffin has published a collection of the
letters in a new book, Dear Anne Frank.
Sarah Foran's letter was one of the 69 chosen to make up the book. In
it she says that though she lives a long way from Anne's home she feels
that they are both quite similar. ''We both play musical instruments and
hate practising,'' she says.
The 12-year-old Scots girl writes: ''Violence is quite a problem in
this world.
''There are wars all over the world, not as big as what you've had to
stand but size isn't the problem. The problem is the reason.''
Sarah continues: ''I think wars are stupid. Even on children's
television there is violence which just encourages younger viewers.
''I think the best way to get round the problem is to make ourselves
heard. We should write to programmes and newspapers expressing our
views.''
Yesterday, Sarah said that she and her classmates at Wellington School
in Ayr had studied Anne's diary before she had written her letter.

<HEADLINE>Tories spread the word over Blair's Euro 'suicide speech'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979009857</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Tories yesterday decided to exploit what they see as a serious
tactical error by Tony Blair in a bid to unite their own party over
Europe.
At a 90-minute political session, with no officials present, the
Cabinet was reported to have reacted with ''glee'' to a strong
pro-European speech delivered by the Labour leader on Wednesday.
Some Ministers believe the policy statements amount to a modern
version of the 1983 Labour manifesto -- later famously described as
''the longest suicide note in history''.
They believe Mr Blair miscalculated badly by showing a willingness in
the right conditions both to water down the British veto in Brussels and
embrace a single currency.
However, it was an apparent pledge to press ahead with a strong
pro-Europe policy in the face of public hostility that was reported to
have been greeted with the most enthusiasm at the meeting.
A senior Tory source said: ''The speech reminds everybody just how
ghastly Labour would be on Europe, and reminds the sceptics where the
real enemy is.
''It was decided that Mr Blair's decision, that he was going to fight
the next election on a position that he explicitly acknowledged was out
of tune with public opinion, was a serious error.
''He has nailed his colours to the mast of a ship taking in water
fast, that of a federal Europe.''
Conservative Central Office has been instructed to exploit the
supposed mistake by mailing a copy of the speech to all Tory MPs and
constituency parties.
However, the Labour Party will see the move as a political stunt which
simply underlines the Government's apparent shift towards a Euro-sceptic
approach.
In his speech, Mr Blair called for Britain to take a lead in Europe
but specifically acknowledged the dangers of being out of step with
public opinion and drifting into a ''federalist morass''.
He added: ''It is true that opinion polls probably would push us
towards a sceptic approach. But I am adamant that such an approach would
be folly and we will not pander to it.''
Mr Blair said the veto should be retained in some areas and he also
endorsed the principle of the single currency, provided that economic
conditions were such that it would benefit Britain and not threaten
sovereignty.
At the Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister ignored the anger of his
back benchers and gave his ''strong support'' to Health Secretary
Virginia Bottomley, only 24 hours after a number of Tory MPs made it
clear they were prepared to vote against her plans to close some of
London's oldest hospitals.
Mr Major also backed Home Secretary Michael Howard, despite a
devastating Law Lords ruling which accused Mr Howard of abusing his
powers by trying to cut compensation payments to victims of violent
crime.
Only 24 hours earlier, both Mrs Bottomley and Mr Howard had come under
intense political pressure. On Wednesday night a clearly rattled Mrs
Bottomley was considered politically damaged and in danger of losing her
job to a summer reshuffle.
With the start of the Easter recess yesterday and the absence of MPs
from Westminster, the pressure appeared to ease.

FAMILY doctors threatened sanctions last night in response to
Government plans to change out-of-hours care.
The proposed changes, announced by Health Minister Gerry Malone, were
attacked by the BMA.
It is understood that one of the sanctions under possible
consideration is for GPs to prescribe more expensive drugs, rather than
generic drugs. This would not harm patients, but would hit the Treasury.

<HEADLINE>Bid to recoup 'small amount' of losses. #800,000 loan inn is for sale</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979009859</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A HIGHLAND inn, which attracted a loan of #800,000 from a phoney
investment scheme that defrauded the Salvation Army, is being sold for
just #200,000.
Mr Lawrence Gillick, the Scottish businessman who paid #255,000 for
the Castle Inn at Dornie in October 1991, is thought now to be living in
Geneva. On a recent brief visit to this country, he called on his
solicitors in Edinburgh and then flew to London to be interviewed by
Scotland Yard fraud squad detectives.
Mr Gillick, son of Rangers FC legend Tory Gillick, is a one-time
bankrupt. Three years ago, he fronted for an Abu Dhabi sheikh who was
allegedly prepared to put #15m into Terry Venables's first failed
attempt to buy Tottenham Hotspur.
The Salvation Army gained decree against Mr Gillick at the High Court
in London almost exactly a year ago and, yesterday, Mr Brian Kingman, of
solicitors Slaughter and May, who act for the charity, said a closing
date for the sale of the Castle Inn had been set because of the high
level of interest. Offers, he said, should be in by today.
''We have judgment against Gillick for $1.5m -- the so-called
investment scheme was carried through in dollars. The #200,000 or so
that we will get from the sale of the Castle Inn is just a very, very
small percentage of that sum and we know of no other assets. That is
why, in years to come, we will be watching Mr Gillick closely. If he
sports a Rolls-Royce, or any other asset turns up, we will seize it.''
The main thrust of the Scotland Yard investigation into the affairs of
Mr Gillick, and others with whom he dealt, is how the Castle Inn, bought
for #255,000, managed to attract a loan of #800,000, more than three
times the purchase price.
Peculiarly, the standard security for the loan was registered in the
names of Salvation Army colonel Grenville Burn and Birmingham
businessman and financier Stuart Ford.
The Salvation Army had no knowledge that its money was being used to
get Mr Gillick into the Highland hotel trade. Colonel Burn, who headed
the Salvation Army's investment department, has since been dismissed.
As police and accountants began to unravel the fraud in so-called
''stand-by letters of credit'' which is believed to have cost the
Salvation Army #6m, Mr Ford, who had been appointed by the world-wide
charity as a fund-raiser notwithstanding an unfortunate financial track
record including the repossession of his home, disappeared to America.
He later returned and both he and Colonel Burn were interviewed by
Detective Inspector David Crinnion, who is leading the Scotland Yard
team investigating the Salvation Army fraud.
In addition to the judgment it holds against Mr Gillick, the Salvation
Army also has decree against Mr Ford and Colonel Burn in connection with
the #800,000 which came into the hands of Mr Gillick.
The three met in Japan while Mr Ford and Colonel Burn were on a
fund-raising trip there -- it cost the Salvation Army #90,000 in hotels,
fares, and entertaining. Mr Gillick offered to help the Salvation Army's
fund-raising effort . . . and shortly after became a borrower from the
charity.
Mr Gillick was made bankrupt in 1980 after his Glasgow-based property
empire collapsed. He was discharged from bankruptcy seven years later.
Lawrence Gillick is still well remembered in the West of Scotland
property world, especially in Ayr, where he built a greyhound stadium.
No races were ever run there and his partner, solicitor Thomas McCool,
was later jailed for embezzlement.

MORE than two-thirds of Scottish business is unhappy with the range of
direct international flights available, a Confederation of British
Industry survey revealed yesterday.
The CBI in Scotland undertook the study along with Scottish Airports
Ltd, as part of ongoing research into infrastructure needs.
A total of 56% of Scots business leaders rated international flights
as important to their needs, while 89% regarded a direct service as
vital to the country's economy.
Mr Vernon Murphy, Scottish Airports managing director, said the
business community needed to demonstrate greater use of international
flights for air services to succeed.

THE trustees of the late Sir William Burrell's will have lodged a
petition of objection to a legal bid by Glasgow District Council to
broaden the scope of loan arrangements for the Burrell Collection.
The council has asked Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, to set in
motion formal procedures leading to a hearing of the Parliamentary
Commissioners. This is expected to take place later this year.
However, the five-strong board of trustees plans to attend the hearing
to defend what it describes as a clear breach of Sir William's last
wishes.
The issue centres on lending provisions under the 1944 agreement
between Sir William and the then Glasgow Corporation, under which the
collection was gifted to the city, an action confirmed by his will nine
years later.
The council is seeking powers to enable it to lend items from the
collection to a gallery or other public place anywhere in the world. At
present, the terms of the will limit loans to galleries in Britain.
Senior trustee, Mr Colin Donald, said yesterday: ''We are in no doubt
that it is the trustees' duty to uphold the clearly stated duties of one
of Scotland's most generous benefactors, in the face of what is
considered to be an ill-judged attempt to change the terms of the
will.''
The trustees have also stated that the question of who is liable for
any damage or loss arising from a loan abroad is at stake.

THE widower of a terminally-ill cancer patient who died after lying in
agony on a trolley in a hospital for nine hours demanded urgent action
last night to prevent such a tragedy happening again.
Mr Mike Curtin discovered the body of his 48-year-old wife, Maggie, in
a side room when he went to visit her at Northwick Park Hospital, in
north London.
''I was absolutely horrified,'' he said. ''One of the things that
worried me is that I have three small children who could have been with
me.
''My daughter could have skipped on ahead to see her mum. The
implications of it are quite horrendous.''
Mr Curtin, from Harrow, north London, said the pressures on the Health
Service had to be looked at. ''My main concern is that this does not
happen to anyone else.''

BULGARIAN fishermen stranded in Lerwick, Shetland, have been beaten
after a three-month official strike for arrears of wages.
Faced with a Court of Session order which could have evicted them from
the factory ship Rotalia later today, the 25 strikers still on board the
rusty vessel reluctantly accepted a deal worked out by lawyers in
Edinburgh.
The settlement between the men and joint British/Bulgarian shipping
company Bourgwells gives them:
* A total of around #60,000 towards their claim of approximately
#150,000 in back pay;
* Free flights home to Bulgaria;
* Immediate restoration of food supplies to the ship;
* No guarantee of freedom from prosecution in Bulgaria -- former
owners Oceanskiy Ribolov have already said they are starting court
proceedings.
The men's spokesman, Shetland Trades Council secretary Peter Hamilton,
said last night: ''They have been forced to accept an entirely
unsatisfactory offer.''
The current owners of the Rotalia applied to the Court of Session for
interim interdict two weeks ago. The court ruled the occupation of the
vessel was illegal but deferred eviction while talks went ahead.
Mr Hamilton said that, following yesterday's overwhelming vote by the
European Parliament in support of the crew, their fate when they
returned home would be keenly scrutinised by parliamentarians and unions
throughout the European Union, which Bulgaria wants to join.
During the dispute, which was backed by the International Transport
Workers Federation and the TUC, the shipowner cut off food and medical
supplies. Shetland trade unionists, churchgoers, and charity workers fed
the crew for seven weeks.

MULTI-billion dollar oil giants who are being sued over the Cormorant
Alpha helicopter disaster were accused yesterday of ''over-bearing
aggression and intimidatory tactics'' against survivors and relatives of
those who died.
The accusation, denied by the companies, was the latest indication
that the legal battle over whether damages actions should be heard in
Scotland or the US is becoming increasingly bitter.
There is now a threat hanging over 53 of the people who are suing that
they could be summoned to the Court of Session for breach of interdict,
although their counsel stated matters were out of their control.
Eleven men died when a Bristow-owned Super Puma helicopter crashed in
the North Sea in March 1992 just after taking off from Shell's Cormorant
Alpha platform.
Legal actions have been raised against Shell, Esso, and Exxon in the
US where the families could win up to 20 times the amount of damages
they could expect to recover in Scotland.
Judge Neil Caldwell has ruled in Brazoria County, Texas, that an
action in the name of 53 of the survivors and relatives should go ahead
in the US. The oil companies have lodged an appeal against that
decision.
Lord Abernethy has already issued a ruling that no procedure should
take place in America to decide the merits of the case, apart from the
decision as to which country has jurisdiction.
On March 9 this year he granted an interim interdict to ban the 53
from taking any steps to transfer the US proceedings from the district
court in Brazoria to the probate court.
The judge said he had to do all he could to preserve the position
previously reached by the Scottish court -- that the oil companies had
made out a stateable case that Scotland was the correct venue.
At the Court of Session yesterday, Lord Abernethy was told that
despite his ruling, the transfer to the probate court is due to take
place on Monday.
Mr Colin Sutherland, QC, for the 53, asked the judge to lift the
interdict he granted last month, and informed the court that since last
month a ''sea of writs'' had been flowing from the oil companies.
He accused the oil giants of overbearing aggression and intimidatory
tactics.
Mr Gerald Moynihan, for the oil companies, denied this, saying the
action was designed to bring about a proper resolution of the dispute.
Lord Abernethy refused to lift the interdict banning the 53 from
taking steps to transfer the proceedings.
There will be a further hearing at the Court of Session next month.

THE Government may have overlooked a tripwire in its own legislation
which could allow the Kyle of Lochalsh ferry to run in direct
competition to the Skye Bridge when it opens this summer, according to
Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye.
At issue is the right of the Railway Users Consultative Committee for
Scotland, created by the 1993 Railway Act, to call a public inquiry into
the withdrawal of ferries. This right was exercised by the RUCCS's
predecessor body the Scottish Transport Users Consultative Committee.
Such a process could take up to nine months but the Government has
written to RUCCS saying it ''may'' no longer have that right.
Mr Kennedy yesterday received a letter from Scottish Office Minister,
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, saying: ''I understand my Hon Friend the
Minister for Railways and Roads will be writing shortly to Mr Kemp
(RUCCS's acting chairman) with a full statement of the Government's
understanding of the position.''
Lord James also makes clear the Scottish Office has had no
consultation with Highland Regional Council, nor has it made any
assessment of the potential impact on the Skye Bridge's finances if the
ferry continued to run.
Mr Kennedy said: ''The carefully chosen words here suggest the
Government has suddenly woken up to the fact it may have overlooked a
tripwire in its own recent legislation.''

In Washigton
NICHOLAS Ingram, the British-born murderer, received a stay of
execution just one hour before he was due to be electrocuted in Georgia
last night.
His lawyers had sent a last-minute appeal to the local court, and the
judge who received it decided that he would need to examine the papers
over-night before ruling, and therefore ordered the stay.
In 1983, when he was 18, Mr Ingram killed a man in Marietta, Georgia,
and tried to kill his wife, after robbing them of $60.
He was caught, convicted on the wife's evidence, and sentenced to
death.
Mr Igram who holds dual British and American nationality, has been on
death row ever since, while the courts examined a series of appeals.
The Board of Pardons and Parole in Georgia had earlier unanimously
rejected a last appeal for mercy. The chairman of the board, Wayne
Garner, met the condemned man -- the first time a chairman of the board
has conducted such an interview.
Mr Garner said later: ''We had a general discussion about his life and
background.''
He said the board had made a great effort to be fair to the victim,
and to the culprit.
His lawyers claim to have new evidence showing that Mr Ingram was
unable to defend himself at his trial 12 years ago because state
officials kept him drugged throughout the proceedings and concealed the
evidence.
Mr Ingram has argued that the influence of a drug, Thorazine, at the
time of his trial made him appear dull and remorseless.
Mr Ingram further claims that at the time of the murder he was
incapacitated by drink.
The opponets of the death penalty argue that that Mr Ingram has been
on death row so long that it amounts to cruel and unusual punishment,
which is barred by the Bill of Rights.
Yesterday was the fourth time that an execution date had been
scheduled for Ingram.
Ingram's mother flew to Washington on Monday, in an attempt to meet Mr
John Major, who was visiting the White House, to ask him to intervene.
The Prime Minister wrote to her, saying he could not do so.
British barrister David Marshall, who has been working with Ingram's
defence team, said Ingram was ''in a state of terror'' when he saw him
on Monday.
Ingram was born in Cambridge to an Englishwoman, married to an
American airman. The family moved to the US a year later.
The execution had been due to take place at the Georgia Diagnostic and
Classification Centre near Jackson, about 40 miles south-east of
Atlanta.
Earlier yesterday, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, had
expressed sorrow that his pleas for a last-minute reprieve had been
ignored by the parole board .
Georgia has executed 18 people since the death penalty was reinstated
there 12 years ago. There have been 14 executions in the United States
so far this year, including one in Texas on Wednesday. In all, 271
people have been executed since 1976, about half of them by lethal
injection (the method used in Texas), most of the rest by electrocution.
Meanwhile, Scotsman Kenny Richey, on death row in the state of Ohio,
is awaiting a retrial, following new evidence which has emerged in the
case in which he was convicted of an arson attack when a three-year-old
girl died in 1986.
Richey, now 29, from Edinburgh, was charged with murder but subsequent
evidence has led to new moves which may prevent his execution, if upheld
by an appeal court.

CONSERVATIVES wake up this morning after their worst nightmare:
annihilation in the Scottish local elections, a disaster at the polls
which saw them lose control of even their flagship council in East
Renfrewshire.
Scotland is left without a single Tory administration among the 29
single-tier authorities which will take over local government a year
from now.
Labour will have more than half of all council seats. They control 20
councils, including Glasgow; the SNP three; the Highlands are
independent; and four councils are hung. Argyll and Bute declares today.
Fife is a Tory-free zone, with not a single Conservative councillor, but
it has two Communists.
Aberdeen, Stirling, East Dunbartonshire and South Ayrshire all toppled
to Labour, while East Renfrewshire is now a hung council, with the
Tories taking just nine of the 20 seats. The SNP, in addition to holding
their rural strongholds of Moray and Angus, took control in Perth in a
result which is a pointer to the parliamentary by-election.
Labour dominated with a 44.4% share of the vote. SNP achieved 26.5%,
Conservatives took 11.25% and the Liberal Democrats had 9.75%. A
surprising factor was the turnout of 44% -- far higher than had been
predicted for what were billed as ''shadow'' elections.
Tories had to take more than 200 seats if they were to keep their
share from previous local government elections: they were on course to
take less than half of that. Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst looked
shell-shocked.
''There is no hiding from the fact that it has been a very
disappointing night,'' said Sir Michael. ''It is a very clear verdict
from the electorate and one we shall heed.''
For Labour it was an unalloyed triumph as council after council fell
to it on a night which saw not a single set-back. Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson called it a ''historic vote'' which had seen
it open up a 20-point gap over the Nationalists.
SNP leader Alex Salmond countered that for his party it was the best
set of local authority results for 20 years. ''I am very happy indeed.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said it was clear they
were winning many more seats than they had expected, possibly as many as
120. ''It's a great result.''
The results will send a shiver through Conservative local government
ranks in England and Wales, where they go to the polls next month. Any
repetition of the Scottish wipe-out -- say the loss of 1000 or more
seats south of the Border -- could heighten the chances of a leadership
challenge in the autumn in a bid to avert disaster at the General
Election.
''It is a pretty disastrous night for us all round and a good night
for Labour,'' said Home Office Minister Michael Forsyth, surveying a
resounding Labour victory in his own heartland of Stirling. ''There are
no words I can find to describe it otherwise. It is very unfair.''
Former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart was gloomy, conceding
early in the evening that East Renfrew would not be the victory his
party was so desperate for.
The Conservatives, in losing overall control in their local authority
stronghold of Eastwood, will have to try to form a minority
administration on the new East Renfrewshire authority.
However, Labour, which won eight seats, pledged it would seek the
backing of the two Liberal Democrat councillors and one Independent in
its bid to form an administration.
Labour won all five wards which were transferred from the Neilston,
Uplawmoor and Barrhead areas of Renfrew district. It also scored
surprise victories in Stamperland and Busby and retained Thornliebank,
its one present seat on Eastwood District Council.
Some Scottish Tory officials privately feared defeat here would lead
to concern about the party's credibility in Scotland.
Renfrew Labour leader Owen Taylor, who took Barrhead South, said he
would ''speak to anyone'' in a bid to form a Labour-dominated
administration and to ''keep the Tories out''.
Tory Party leader on Eastwood District Council, Mr Gordon Macdonald,
said: ''Obviously we are very disappointed that we did not get a
majority but I'm sure the nine Conservative councillors will work even
harder to provide the services which we have provided at Eastwood for
the past 25 years.''
Labour also took the formerly true blue Tory seat of Hyndland,
prompting the observation from Scottish Labour Party's general
secretary, Mr Jack McConnell: ''If we can take that seat, anything is
possible.''
Labour leader Tony Blair was jubilant, promising to build on the
successes in the English and Welsh elections. ''It is another great
night for the Labour Party, a disappointment for the Nationalists and a
disaster for the Tories.''
Already last night there were signs of recrimination, as Tories in
Aberdeen and Glasgow pointed the finger in the direction of Downing
Street in the search for scapegoats and excuses for the Scottish
debacle.

THE BBC was at the centre of a fresh broadcasting row yesterday, this
time with Labour on centre stage, when Donald Dewar was given an
important television platform shortly after the polls opened.
The Shadow Social Security Secretary was the guest on BBC2's
Westminster On-Line, a 45-minute phone-in programme yesterday morning.
Even Labour's media experts admitted it was a surprising development in
a week when they had gone to the courts to block the Panorama interview
with Mr Major.
The development angered the other parties. The Tories said it proved
Labour's actions over Panorama were merely a stunt; the SNP described it
as flagrant bias; and the Liberal Democrats said the BBC had shown a
lack of ''political sensitivity''.
Labour's senior media strategist, Mr David Hill, conceded that such an
interview could probably not take place on the morning of next month's
local elections in England.
The programme's producer was unrepentant. Mr Nigel Pritchard said:
''We don't believe we are wrong. It's the same as Panorama.'' But had
not Scottish judges ruled the BBC wrong on Panorama? ''We don't believe
we were wrong. That is why we are fighting it legally.''
