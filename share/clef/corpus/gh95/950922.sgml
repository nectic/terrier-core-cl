Many bosses wonder why they should pay for training programmes if
skills can be bought in when needed. Joan Grady hears of attempts to
change that attitude before Scotland slips further down the skills
league.
PART ONE: THE FAULTS.
SCOTLAND comes close to the bottom of the world league in skills,
according to the chairman of CBI Scotland, John Ward. ''Contrary to
popular belief, we come 21st out of a possible 24 in world skill
ranking,'' he told a World Skills conference at Glasgow's Royal Concert
Hall. ''It's not that our top skills aren't the best, more that our
mid-range skills are uncompetitive.
''The problem lies in deciding where to compete. We have low
investment in skills in commodities and high investment in skills in
intellectual property. We must decide which end of the spectrum to go
to. We must make sure we have high labour content, high skills and high
investment.''
Scotland is also among the worst-hit parts of the UK for skills
shortages, and Scots companies are close to the bottom of the list for
giving priority to training, according to Scottish Enterprise's Director
of Industry and Skills, Bob Downes. ''It appears that firms are only
gradually coming round to understanding that in-house training may be a
more cost-effective way of alleviating skill shortages than buying in
the missing skills,'' he says.
Irvine Valley's largest employer, Vesuvius Ltd, with 320 engineers,
designers, research staff and process workers, told the same recent
conference about losing a #2.5m contract from British Steel because of
poor training and managerial skills.
Training and development manager John Anderson recounted how, after
the company adopted an in-house training programme, ''British Steel's
buying department re-examined their costs. Our self-management teams
project appealed to them and we regained the contract.''
Mr Anderson's conclusion: ''It is more costly not to train.'' Indeed,
training should be an increasingly important area to business, in a
climate where technological advances make it necessary for employers to
retrain employees more than once. But the truth is that convincing
bosses to pay for training programmes is not easy. Figures released by
the Industrial Society in February showed the average employer spent
#384 on training per employee -- a drop of 22% on two years before.
''Difficulties of scale present other problems,'' says Tom McCool,
chief executive of Scotvec, the Scottish Vocational Educational Council.
''Large companies will find it easier to implement training programmes
than smaller ones.''
Yet in spite of this advantage, Industrial Society figures show it is
smaller organisations, employing fewer than 100, which have lower skills
shortages and which spend the most days training staff.
''As employees take on more and more responsibilities they need to be
up to speed in a whole range of skills,'' says Graham Houston, head of
the Industrial Society for Scotland and Northern Ireland. ''Although
training managers clearly recognise this need, their budgets are being
cut. Without sufficient and broadly-based training employees will
flounder and organisations will suffer.''
Employers counter that many trainees, once they receive training,
promptly take it and themselves elsewhere. One hotel-industry delegate
complained he had spent thousands training people -- who then quickly
moved on.
There were no easy answers. Programmes such as SVQs, Skillseekers and
their equivalents are relatively new, and their faults as well as their
good points are only now coming to the fore. ''Difficulties come from
the view of employers,'' said McCool. ''They say standards are
inappropriate and training is time-consuming and cumbersome.''
Although his remarks were about the Vocational Qualification (VQ) in
particular, they reflected an apparent reluctance on the part of
employers in general to come to terms with their training needs,
preferring to buy in skills when necessary.
''Business is the vehicle for wealth and job creation, but people
arethe key to business competitiveness,'' said Downes. ''In these
circumstances the knowledge, skills, attitudes and creativity of our
people are the key sources of sustainable regional competitive
advantage.''
Many employers also complain that to take on a trainee increases
paperwork, that standards are not high enough and that training is
costly and may not always guarantee a competent employee.
Of the 170 delegates 108 were employers, invited to evaluate their own
training, to increase their understanding of its importance, and to
learn of help available to them. Sectors represented included hotel and
catering, visitor attractions, sport and recreation and food and drink.
Other delegates represented Scottish Enterprise, SCOTVEC, the STUC and
training organisations. Employers are increasingly being encouraged to
adopt the Scottish Vocational Qualification (SVQ), a work-based
qualification designed to give the real experience and skills employers
need from staff.
''Today's VQs can be achieved on or off the job, part-time or
full-time, through distance learning and in many other ways,'' said
McCool. ''The content of training gives a broad preparation for working
life and job-specific qualifications. It also brings all qualifications
into the national record.
''They are specifically designed to recognise workplace training. They
are based on standards developed by employers which means they must be
much closer to the needs of all employers than hitherto.''
More than 12,000 people achieved VQs through Youth Training in
1994/95, with an 18% increase in the numbers reaching the top skills
levels. Positive outcomes from Training for Work also went up by 20%,
with almost 8000 adults also gaining VQs.
Six months after leaving Youth Training 70% of leavers are in
full-time or part-time employment, further education or training.
Representatives from small businesses, at least, agreed that
investment in training was a priority. ''It's too early to talk about
benefits,'' said Ian Palmer, general manager of Invergordon Distillery.
''They're happening as a natural by-product of implementing standards
and SVQs, and it's heartening to see.''

* ON paper, Training for Work is a success. It has accounted for
almost 8000 Vocational Qualifications gained by adults in 1994/1995, and
figures show that, six months after leaving the programme, almost half
the leavers were in employment.
''We want to see a much higher percentage of people on Training for
Work getting a job at the end of it,'' says Bob Downes at Scottish
Enterprise.
''A large proportion of people who have been unemployed for six months
do gain employment after Training for Work, but long-term unemployed
tend to go through the course without getting a job at the end.''
However, there are wide variations in the quality of individual
schemes. One woman graduate, who had been unemployed for two years, has
just completed a Training for Work programme -- and claims it has not
helped her job prospects.
''There was no structured training,'' she says. ''The only skills I
brought out were those I took in with me. Training for Work is designed
to give long-term unemployed the chance to get back into working life.
It hasn't for me.''
Although LECs perform regular audits of TfW initiatives, figures can
be fiddled. Audits are arranged in advance, and on her scheme trainees
who regularly went absent were told to report in for the audits.
Training plans are not always adhered to and there are still
programmes which do not offer any sort of benefit, far less formal
qualification.
Other schemes do provide results. John Logan is a
supervisor/instructor with a community-industry TfW programme in
photography.
''We'll be providing NVQs up to Level 4 in about two months' time,''
he says. ''It should cover everything from removing the lens cap to
developing your own prints.
''Results are measured through output, observation and a process of
continuous assessment. You don't have to be an expert to join in -- the
idea is to learn.''

DENMARK'S Aalborg will replace Dynamo Kiev in this season's European
Champions' League if a ban on the Ukrainian champions is confirmed, UEFA
said yesterday.
UEFA's control and disciplinary committee barred the Kiev side from
European competition for three seasons for attempting to bribe the
referee before a group A match with Panathinaikos of Greece last week.
The Board of Appeal will hear a request by Dynamo to have the ban
overturned on Sunday.
Aalborg were eliminated from the champions' competition by Dynamo Kiev
in a preliminary round and had been widely expected to fill the vacant
berth.
UEFA have declared the Panathinaikos match, which Dynamo won 1-0, null
and void. The substitute fixture between Aalborg and the Greek champions
will be played on October 25.

Frank Shennan discovers that bossy bosses don't get the best results
in recruitment
EMPLOYERS in Scotland are taking longer to hire staff and applicants
have more hurdles to jump to get a job, according to Britain's leading
independent advisory and training body.
It also seems some bosses have learned little from from a report that
showed ''a surprising number'' of them treating applicants with
''complete disregard and sometimes real rudeness'' -- this from a survey
by the Industrial Society, which has more than 10,000 member
organisations, and campaigns for best practice in the management of
people.
But since that survey -- of more than 400 UK personnel managers and
directors, carried out a year ago yesterday -- some things have changed.
''It is now a longer process from realising the need for additional
staff to recruiting,'' says Graham Houston, head of the Society for
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
''The knee-jerk reaction of hiring 100 new workers immediately is not
the case anymore. Employers have realised that new people must fit into
the organisation smoothly and mix well with existing employee
characteristics to create workable teams.
''To this end, employers now have to plan for placing ads and conduct
two or more interviews for making an appointment decision. Recruitment
processes are also becoming more refined with more use of assessment
centres and psychometric testing.''
But more sophisticated selection procedures are no substitute for
old-fashioned courtesy. And what is at stake is more than good manners
-- it is the perception of the company as a whole.
''Employers must also remember that their recruitment process is a
barometer of the company,'' says Houston. ''Poor information, slow
response times and insulting questions reflect badly on the company and
will put off many potential employees.
''Throughout the recruitment process the employer must maintain an
honest and open line of communication with the potential employee.''
The Industrial Society's recruitment expert, Julie Amber, is critical
of many employers for their treatment of job candidates. ''I am still
hearing the same old stories,'' she says. ''While some organisations are
wonderful, and can painlessly turn down a candidate, others can be
horrible and make the interviewee feel diminished.''
This treatment tends to be linked to poor recruitment methods in
general, which are characterised by a lack of thought and pre-planning.
''Sometimes the employers will have only a vague idea of what they are
recruiting for. They do not question if the job has changed, or what
kind of person they will require.''
The recession and continuing high level of unemployment have made
circumstances worse in many companies, where the attitude is nothing
short of ''cavalier'', says Amber. ''The attitude is 'There are plenty
more people out there.' There are still organisations which feel the
workforce is expendable. They don't realise what they are losing. If you
do not care about your workforce, how can you expect them to care about
you?
''What has happened with the recession is that a lot of good practices
have vanished, under the guise of human resources management. Some
organisations have used that as a way of treating people as an
expendable resource.''
But the greater loss is not usually to the company. Although estimates
of the average cost of advertising vacancies are given in the story on
the right, the true cost of making a mistake in recruitment is far
higher.
Among the most obvious costs will be training the candidate in the
skills he or she should have had, or terminating the employment of the
wrong candidate, re-advertising the position, and management time spent
on the process. Less obvious will be the overtime paid to cover the loss
of the individual, the price in company morale, lost production, a fall
in quality, and loss of business and goodwill.
There may be also a longer-term price in accumulated stress among
other employees, and a lack of commitment by them resulting from what
they see as neglect of their welfare.
The actual method of selection is probably less important than
applying that method carefully. ''Research shows that interviews are not
terribly good indicators of performance,'' says Amber. ''It all depends
on the skill of the interviewer and how well they have thought about the
job.''
Yet the more extreme mistakes companies make are due to more than
simply lack of skill. Aggressive questioning reveals more about the
interviewer than the interviewee. It tends also to be an inefficient way
of soliciting information. Relaxing candidates and encouraging them to
talk will reveal far more.
Some interviewers still ask intrusive questions of candidates,
especially women, including inquiries about their personal life or their
marriage prospects.
The aggressive approach plays into the hands of the ''good talker''
who can handle such obvious lines of questioning. He will be less able
to parry more carefully thought-out questions designed to detect
exaggerations, evasions, or professional shortcomings.
A more encouraging approach would reveal the candidate who is better
suited but may be less relaxed or experienced at interviews.
If the interviewer has a clear idea of what the job to be filled
requires, he will find it easier to find the matching skills in the
candidate.
Different types of tests are now available to recruiters, and again
how they are used tends to be more important than the method, although
tests of ability tend to be more reliable than purely ''psychological'
tests.
If employers added up the potential cost to their company of making
the wrong decision they would invest more in the selection process. The
attitude that ''there are plenty more people out there'' looks more than
a little short-sighted in an age of seious skill shortages.

ENGLAND fly-half Rob Andrew, who yesterday became Britain's first
full-time professional rugby player with the announcement of a
five-year, six-figure contract as director of rugby development with
Newcastle-Gosforth, expects to cast his recruiting net over the Border
into Scotland. Andrew, 32, is the first big signing for millionaire Sir
John Hall's Newcastle United Sporting Club, which added
Newcastle-Gosforth to its sporting portfolio a fortnight ago.
Yesterday, Sir John declared: ''Rob is a player of international
class. We have got the Kevin Keegan of rugby. He will do for the game
here in the north east just what Kevin has done for football.''
The England stand-off accepted Sir John's offer -- said to be worth
#750,000 -- despite the fact that it might put his international career
in jeopardy.
He will become player-manager with the Courage League, division 2
side.

THE sponsors' dream draw for the semi-final of the Coca Cola Cup
arrived yesterday when Rangers were paired with Aberdeen in a clash
which was -- surprise, surprise -- immediately scheduled for live
television coverage, writes Ken Gallacher.
That match will be played at Hampden on Tuesday, October 24, with the
all first division clash between Dundee and Airdrie taking place at
McDiarmid Park the following night.
There would be those who would have felt that the giants of the
premier division would have been kept apart at this stage of the
tournament.
But, of course, there is no fooling about when these draws are made
and yesterday the Scotland team manager, Craig Brown, was one of the
main players making the draw as the semi-final pairings were revealed.

SOME preconceived ideas as to the formation of Europe's pairings for
the foursomes games which will start the thirty-first Ryder Cup match
against the United States, the clear favourites, at Oak Hill, Rochester,
today, were yesterday confounded. Notably Severiano Ballesteros, a
pillar of the establishment, was omitted, a decision stoutly defended by
the captain, Bernard Gallacher.
''Seve agrees with me,'' Gallacher asserted. ''It's a long week and I
can't play him in every game. He will have an important part, coming in
at the moment which is best for him and the team.'' Gallacher declined
to be drawn on whether he would have included Ballesteros had his
long-time partner, Jose Maria Olazabal, not been absent through injury.
Ballesteros will thus not play on the first morning for the first time
in eight matches. But Gallacher said by way of further explanation:
''Seve's game is about bogeys and birdies and foursomes are more about
par.'' That probably accounts also for Ian Woosnam's omission along with
David Gilford and Philip Walton, but Gallacher added: ''I'm 90% certain
everyone will play before the singles.''
Whether or not Gallacher's judgment has given the opposition an
uncoded message about the state of Ballesteros's game and a
psychological lift remains to be seen. The reaction of Ballesteros
himself, who has lost in only three out of 14 foursomes games, was
cryptic: ''It's the captain's job to pick the players in the best form
and that's all I have to say.''
Doubtless the looseness to which the games of Ballesteros and Woosnam
are increasingly subject influenced Gallacher. The 6902-yard course has
been deliberately set up more typically for a 72-hole championship grind
than matches over the explosive 18-hole sprint. The rough is about five
inches deep beyond the first fringe bordering narrow fairways and quick
greens.
As expected, Colin Montgomerie and Nick Faldo, who gained
two-and-a-half points out of four together in 1993, lead off against US
Open champion Corey Pavin and Tom Lehman. Howard Clark and Mark James,
who lost a foursome but won two fourballs in 1989, are re-united to play
Davis Love and Jeff Maggert, like Lehman a newcomer.
The new partnerships match Sam Torrance and Costantino Rocca against
Jay Haas and Fred Couples and Bernhard Langer, who seemed likely to be
paired with Woosnam, has instead been put in charge of Per-Ulrik
Johansson, the other European, with Walton, new to the occasion.
They will face the most experienced American partnership, Masters
champion Ben Crenshaw, at 43 America's oldest player, and 40-year-old
Curtis Strange, winner of the 1989 US Open title over this course, who
have together appeared in seven matches. They, Couples and Love were
restricted in final practice yesterday to nine holes by Lanny Wadkins,
who elected to leave out Peter Jacobsen and three of his newcomers in
Brad Faxon, Phil Mickelson, and Loren Roberts.
With the example of almost the whole history of these matches and,
more recently, of the Walker Cup, the imperative of building a healthy
credit balance of points to take into Sunday's 12 singles will need no
emphasising when Gallacher gives his players their battle orders.
In the 30 previous encounters American teams have lost the singles on
only four occasions and, indeed, since the Continental element was
introduced in 1979 Europe have won a singles series only once in eight
attempts, at The Belfry in 1985 on the way to defeating the United
States for the first time in 28 years.
Not even at Muirfield Village two years later, when the first victory
on American soil in 15 attempts was gained, could Europe take the
singles. Another factor could now enter the equation -- stamina.
Torrance, Clark, and James are into their fifth decades and Faldo,
Rocca, Langer and Ballesteros, all 38, are not exactly in the first
flush of golfing youth.
Over the last six matches -- of which the United States have won three
and Europe two, with one tie -- Europe have actually outscored the
opposition by 85[1/2] points to 82[1/2], but American teams have a
seven-point advantage in the singles and, unexpectedly, a three-point
margin in the foursomes. As curiously, Europe have amassed a lead of no
fewer than 13 points in fourball.
Montgomerie has said: ''We have to make them fight from the start,''
perhaps recalling that going into the singles tied at 8-8 two years ago,
Europeans lost the first hole in seven of the 11 games. That was not the
whole story of their eventual defeat, but five singles were lost and
with them the contest.
It is all very well comparing favourably European careers with those
of the United States players -- for example, 51 appearances in the match
and 13 major titles, as against 15 and six respectively. That degree of
experience obviously is helpful, but in the clenched-hair atmosphere of
this event not necessarily decisive.
Although both teams' average age is 36 the European side, somewhat
unkindly dubbed ''The Zimmer-frame Brigade'' is undeniably ageing and
injury-prone, their over-reliance on the same players who have served
the cause for years the direct and inevitable consequence of too many of
the younger players having failed to sustain the promise shown early in
their tournament lives.
Lest these assessments look less than positive there are unknown
quantities and potential negatives among the opposition. There are five
newcomers to the match, compared with Europe's two, and such as
Crenshaw, Jacobsen, and Roberts are in the side largely on their form of
last year or early this season.
Haas is the only American with a winning record (and he played only
once, 12 years ago), whereas Faldo, Ballesteros, Langer, Montgomerie and
Woosnam all have won more times than lost, but this year Jacobsen,
Faxon, Haas and Crenshaw have completed 72 holes in the four majors and
on the European side only Faldo.
Faldo may say with every justification: ''We are the underdogs this
time, so we're just going to go for it -- a much more relaxed way of
going into the match. We've got a free shot.'' In fact what we have
here, of all weeks, is a test of seizing the moment and of warm-blooded
resolve, not a contest between arid tournament statistics.

* COMPANIES make life more difficult for themselves and for job
applicants by making a number of common mistakes.
The job applicant's life is made uncomfortable by a series of
discourtesies, including not replying to applications, treating people
impolitely at interviews, and not informing candidates quickly about the
results of interviews.
Interviewers also go in for aggressive questioning and sometimes even
intimidating practices, such as seating interviewees in a lower chair.
The irony is that such macho techniques do not prevent interviewers
from making things worse for their companies. They are just as likely to
be taken in by the ''professional interviewee'', who is capable of
''talking a good game'' and hiding his unsuitability for the job.
Some employers are ''quite vulnerable to the person who is good at
interviews'', says the Industrial Society's recruitment expert, Julie
Amber. ''If interviewers were clear about what they wanted they would be
able to ask more probing questions.
''They would be able to sift out these people and find the best person
for the job, rather than the best interviewee. Some people are turned
down who would be the best but are not good at interviews. They get
nervous or are not good at selling themselves.
''It is all about being very clear what you are looking for.''
Interviewers should probe candidates' answers, rather than simply
follow their own set list of questions.
The average cost of advertising alone for senior managers is more than
#860, and more than #750 for other managers and #600 for other
professional staff.
''You are saving an enormous amount of money by recruiting the right
people with the right skills to do the job,'' says Amber. ''These are
people who are hopefully going to stay with you rather than get
disillusioned and leave.''

THE Herald today launches Arena, an important new weekly column which
aims to provide leading competitors, administrators, and officials with
a personal forum for their views on sporting issues. CRAIG REEDIE, a
Scot, and chairman of the British Olympic Association, and UK delegate
to the International Olympic Committee, starts the ball rolling with a
studied criticism of the Government's cavalier treatment of our Olympic
competitors.
IN 302 days, the Centennial Olympic Games will open in the newly-built
Olympic Stadium in Atlanta. Every one of the 197 National Olympic
Committees is expected to be represented. The standards will be higher
than ever before and medal winners will be more widespread than in any
previous Games.
This week, the British Olympic Association launched its national
appeal for #4m, which is the sum required to provide the British team
with the preparation they will need to deliver them to Atlanta ready to
compete at these highest of levels.
The time might be opportune to examine whether British sport presently
is set up to deliver its elite competitors to World Championships and
Olympic Games in sufficient numbers, and in shape to maintain our record
as the fourth most successful nation in Olympic history.
Numbers are important. The Olympic movement grows year by year, and
gains in importance in the world sporting community.
Qualification standards become ever stricter. In some sports -- boxing
and weightlifting would be good examples -- the requirement to qualify
for top events by results in European championships brings the British
competitor into direct competition with athletes from the new republics
in Eastern Europe.
The entries used to contain three good Soviets -- now it can be 39
almost equally formidable competitors. It is important that Britain
competes in as many of the Olympic sports as possible, but now just
getting to the Games is a victory in itself.
Britain likes its Olympic successes -- or near misses. The profiles of
Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell owe much to their gold medals in
Barcelona. Chris Boardman put cycling back on the map. Jayne Torvil and
Christopher Deane broke every television sports rating record on their
comeback in Lillehammer.
The country enjoys its sporting heroes and heroines, but they emerge
from a haphazard system. France, Germany, and Italy -- and most recently
Norway and Spain -- invest in their elite athletes. Australia is using
the award of the 2000 Olympic Games to focus its investment.
In many countries, the elite Olympic competitor is supported
throughout his or her competitive life, and is given all the necessary
coaching, technical, medical and sports science back-up. Few of them
become rich, but they are provided with sufficient support to allow them
to be full-time athletes and to compete in a proper programme of
international events without any financial or organisational concerns.
Their lifestyle management is planned, and carries on to their ''life
after sport.''
In the British Olympic Association, we know all about these programmes
-- and we have some top experts who help us put our own programmes in
place. Sadly, we struggle to provide the resources required by both
athlete and helper.
The Sports Councils pay out grant aid to the Olympic Governing Bodies
of Sport -- around #4.5m comes from the Sports council in London, with
some further grants in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. BOA
research indicates that only 29% is allocated to elite sport -- a tiny
figure for a country with our population. This grant covers coaching,
staffing, the international programme and some sports science and
medicine.
None is spent on the athlete -- his keep is in the hands of personal
sponsorship or a grant from the Sports Aid Foundation. There is a
constant battle to make ends meet -- for the competitor and for his
governing body.
Rowing, one of our most successful sports on the world stage, uses
individual grants to oarsmen to subsidise travel costs and asks its
competitors to pay to represent their country. Steven Redgrave (probably
our most famous Olympian) and Matthew Pinsent have enough support to
train full time. Johnny and Greg Searle -- gold medallists from
Barcelona -- will only be able to train full-time next year.
Many must have thought that the National Lottery would solve the
problems, but not so. Lottery grants for sport are restricted to capital
projects -- including some welcome equipment grants -- but no funds are
allocated to competitors, nor to the revenue requirements of their
governing bodies.
There was genuine expectation that Lottery funds would be spread
across the sporting spectrum. I know of no elite competitor who does not
support the provision of sporting facilities, but it is becoming
increasingly irritating to see the Lottery produce far more funds than
originally anticipated yet to persist in enforcing a rigid
''capital-only'' policy.
The fortunate few -- very, very few -- of our elite competitors can
earn good money. The majority do not. Of the Barcelona team in 1992 only
40% had full-time jobs, 73% had received grants from the Sports Aid
Foundation, and of these 97% received less than #5000. Individual
sponsorships ranged from #1000 to #10,000.
The needs of the elite competitor are greater than that. It is for
these reasons that the BOA invests the funds it raises in training camps
in the heat of Tallahassee in Florida, in its own British Olympic
Medical Centre, in exercise physiology, nutrition, psychology,
bio-mechanics, lifestyle-management, and in the whole area of technical
back-up that is crucial to the performance of the elite competitor -- to
say nothing of the logistical challenge in moving 500 people with all
their varied equipment to the United States next July, and a smaller
group to the Winter Games, at Nagano in Japan in 1998.
We cannot change the system before Atlanta. We can only hope that in
the brave new world of United Kingdom Sports Councils and the proposed
new British Academy of Sport, people will understand that the options
are simple: we either support our sportsmen and women in their efforts
to compete in an ever more competitive international environment, or we
rely on throwing up the occasional natural talent who gets to the very
top despite our inability to provide proper resources.
Our elite athletes are a force for good in our society -- they deserve
more from us than we provide.

THE grass roots of British athletics are seething at the resources
being consumed by a handful of elite competitors -- internationalists
who themselves, we can reveal, are rebelling because they feel their
needs are not being properly met.
Both camps have a legitimate complaint, and resolving it will tax the
ingenuity of British Athletics Federation rulers, who, if they fail,
could find themselves voted out of office.
The Herald has established that international athletes held a secret
meeting following the Great Britain v USA match last month, and are
shortly expected to deliver a list of grievances to the BAF.
Former internationalist Mike Whittingham, consultant on BAF's
athletes' services programme which helps them prepare for major
championships, confirmed that the meeting expressed discontent at a new
payment system, already exposed in these columns, and over provision of
competitive opportunities and medical and other back-up facilities.
''We are doing our best to address this, but it comes down to lack of
money,'' said Whittingham, coach of former European and Commonwealth 400
metres champion Roger Black.
''The BAF arranged competition and financial assistance for 130
athletes who went abroad this year, but, frankly, I am amazed at the
cheek of some of those who expect payment.''
But ordinary club members are incensed, as they revealed in a series
of public meetings throughout the UK, in which Peter Radford, BAF's
executive chairman, discussed the federation's role with competitors,
coaches, and club representatives.
Three of these meetings, which concluded last week, were in Scotland
where the near-unanimous verdict was that BAF expends too much time,
energy, and money on too few people.
There was also considerable resentment at the appearance fees paid to
competitors such as Linford Christie and Colin Jackson.
The federation is responsibile for all ordinary club members, not just
the international elite, and for providing and organising resources,
including coaching, serving them all.
This year, more than 500 competitors, including juniors, have
represented Britain on road, cross-country, race-walking, and track and
field. These athletes are selected by BAF, but that number represents
less half of one percent of club members in the UK. None of them,
however, pays any money to BAF, all of whose income derives from
sponsorship and TV.
A communications breakdown, and lack of understanding of how modern
athletics works, is at the root of the sport's problems.
Irrespective of grass roots' displeasure at fees paid to the likes of
Christie and Jackson, the fact is that the labourers are worthy of their
hire. Without their presence, there would be no TV coverage, no
sponsorship, and no income.
''If you take money out of the pockets of athletes, the sport will
fail,'' warns Bob Inglis, mentor of Scottish international 400m runner
Melanie Neef, and one of Britain's most respected coaches. ''Without the
best athletes at televised meetings in the UK, the sport will go down
the tubes.''
Inglis also believes that attempts by both BAF and the Scottish
federation to tie athletes to legally binding contracts is: ''a
misplaced strategy. Many of them are not mature enough to handle the
implications. Athletics is adopting, piecemeal, strategies from other
sports, which athletics itself is not mature enough yet to put in
place.''
Both Radford and Whittingham echo what British Olympic Association
chairman Craig Reedie says elsewhere on this page: calling on the
Government to change National Lottery rules to allow funding of the
preparation of elite sportsmen.

ABERDEEN manager Roy Aitken yesterday relished the prospect of meeting
and beating Rangers in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final.
He is certain to have made a record signing for the Pittodrie club
before the Hampden clash on October 24.
Dons' chairman Ian Donald has promised the entire proceeds of their
share issue which ends tomorrow for team rebuilding.
Aitken has been linked with million-pound deals for Oldham's Paul
Bernard, Dundee United's Billy McKinlay, and Sheffield Wednesday's John
Sheridan.
While his players had hoped for draw against first division opponents,
the Dons manager insisted: ''This is a great stage for my team to go and
show what they are all about.''

CELTIC and Falkirk are #500,000 apart in their value of central
defender John Hughes. But a transfer tribunal sitting today in Glasgow
will decide the fee that the Parkhead side have to pay. Celtic signed
Hughes, who was out of contract, and have offered #200,000, but Falkirk
want #700,000.
The tribunal, under Lord McCluskey, will also decide the fee that
Airdrie must pay for central defender Sean Sweeney, signed from
Clydebank, and the fee for striker Alan Kennedy, who moved from Montrose
to Arbroath.
Cowdenbeath also will appear at the newly set-up Transfer Commission
which involves the Scottish League and the Scottish Junior FA. The
Fifers are in disagreement with three junior clubs over the fees for
striker David Scott, signed from Whitburn, keeper Steve Chappell, from
Oakley United, and defender Graham Meldrum from Bo'ness.
* EAST FIFE player-manager Steve Archibald was out of contract when he
played earlier this season in the Challenge Cup defeat by Dundee -- and
that led yesterday to a censure for his club from the Scottish League
when the management committee met in Glasgow.
Morton were also censured as they played the Cameroon keeper, Andre
Boe, in a reserve match when they did not have international clearance.
Raith Rovers, who included Bosnian Dino Valatic, in a reserve match
without clearance, also receieved a censure.
* THE Scottish League will not follow the lead of other countries who
request that an injured player may be taken off the pitch by stretcher
before receiving treatment.
The management committee discussed the idea, but League secretary
Peter Donald said: ''We have taken medical advice and decided that, as
at present, the physio should decide the extent of the injury.''

THE Coca Cola Cup semi-final between Rangers and Aberdeen is clearly
the major tournament event when it is played next month.
But the clash in Perth between the first-division contenders Airdrie
and Dundee is almost as intriguing.
Here we have Airdrie, Scottish Cup finalists last season,
scalp-hunters in any tournament, especially since manager Alex MacDonald
took over, and Dundee battling it out for a massive pay-day which would
make their respective seasons so much less complicated financially.
And while Airdrie have so much to sustain them after the past few
seasons, when they have glimpsed glory so often, Dundee have a new
steeliness which carried them to their quarter final victory over Hearts
at Dens Park the other night.
It was put into words by their captain, Neil Duffy, yesterday as he
watched the draw in Glasgow. The central defender remained confident
after his team were sent in against Airdrie, and stressed the qualities
which had pushed the financially-strapped Dens Park side into this
situation.
Said Duffy: ''We have let our fans down in the first division games
because we have been ahead in four of them and then dropped points. But
we have not lost our own belief in what we can do.
''Against Hearts, when it came down to penalties, the gaffer asked us
who wanted to take the kicks. Ten hands went up, we were all there ready
to take them. ''I think we knew then that we could still win the game.
''You know, the fans must have wondered what was going on. We had
thrown away a lead just as we have been doing in the league. But, this
time, we held on and the supporters were with us all the way.
''It was great. Now we want this to give us the boost we need to get
into the Premier League again. We are good enough, our Cup results this
season have proved that.
''We believe, now, that we can reach the final.''
Obviously Airdrie's manager Alex MacDonald will dispute that. And
everyone in Scottish soccer recognises that MacDonald will send out a
side which will not be easily diverted from another place in the Hampden
spotlight.
Yesterday, MacDonald refused to look back to last year's semi-final of
this tournament when his side lost at McDiarmid Park in a penalty
shoot-out with eventual winners Raith Rovers.
''That doesn't matter to us now,'' he said. ''We have been back there
since then, and we have been wished good luck by the people there and it
holds no worries for us. We don't look to the past. We always look
forward to the next game and we are happy with what the draw has handed
us.
''Once more we are certain to see a team from a lower League in the
final, and that should suggest to the people in control of the game that
a bigger top league is necessary.
''Raith Rovers won this tournament last season and now ourselves or
Dundee will be in the final this year. I think that tells you
something.''
It does, indeed. And it also tells the big guns in the other game that
whoever goes back to Hampden will find themselves with a challenge to
face.
Perhaps they already realise that. Yesterday, Aberdeen's assistant
manager, Tommy Craig, said: ''I am not prepared to say that I would have
preferred one of the other tams. That might look as if I am putting them
down when, in fact, they have had exceptional results against premier
opposition.
''In any case, we know that to win anything at all you have to come to
Glasgow and beat the Old Firm. The great thing for us is that we are
back in a semi-final, and that is the kind of boost we need at the club
after last season.''
Rangers, naturally, take the draw as it comes, with manager Walter
Smith recognising that his team must lift themselves again, and again,
as they strive to produce the trophies their fans demand with such
regularity.

Scotland 2, Holland 4
SCOTLAND'S Under-17s slumped to defeat with disastrous four-minute
slump when they lost three goals. Now they cannot win this Four Nations
tournament at Forthbank, Stirling, and are sitting at the bottom of the
table with Denmark without a point after two games. Holland and Belgium
meet tomorrow.
Scotland seemed to be on course for the three points when Oldham's
Allan Clark put them ahead in 27 minutes from close range. But early in
the second half, the Dutch equalised through Robert Ravensbergen. Two
minutes later, Lucas Van der Belt added a second. And in 51 minutes, he
hit the third. He completed his hat trick in 65 minutes. Eight minutes
from time, Kevin Queen got a second for the Scots with a low drive
Belgium, who defeated Scotland on Tuesday, kept their 100 per cent
record with a convincing 3-0 win over Denmark.
Anderlecht's Gerd Janssens opened the scoring in 25 minutes when he
shot home at the second attempt. His Anderlecht teammate, Walter
Baseggio, added a second with a 30-yard free-kick, and Janssens
completed the scoring.
SCOTLAND -- Cook (Rangers) McCaffrey (Hibs) Watt (Rangers) Fallon
(dundee united) MacLeod (Bolton) David Young (Rangers) Darren Young
(Aberdeen) McBride (Celtic) Clark (Oldham) Easton (dundee United )
Holmes (Hearts) Substitutes -- Mitchell (St Mirren) Queen (Hearts)
Borland (Celtic) Martin (Hibs) Innes (Oldham).
HOLLAND -- Need, Ravensbergen, Belvroy, Veldman, Broerse, Wielaert,

Ten Hove, Kuiper, Scharrenburg, Achonu.
Referee -- K Clark (Paisley).

THE Herald can claim to have played a part in creating the Ryder Cup
by sponsoring, as the then Glasgow Herald, a tournament at Gleneagles in
the 1920s at which American professionals took part.
It was in association with this tournament in 1921 that a match was
arranged between the top pros of America and Britain. Flamboyant
American Walter Hagen and golf magazine publisher James Harnett promoted
the idea.
Two teams met in a casual friendly at Gleneagles that year, marking
the last appearance together of the ''Great Triumvirate'' of Harry
Vardon, J H Taylor and James Braid. Britain won 10[1/2]-4[1/2].
Another unofficial match occurred when the Royal and Ancient Club
introduced qualifying rounds before the 1926 Open, forcing overseas
players to arrive early. With extra time on their hands, the Americans
agreed to form a team against the British pros at Wentworth. Britain won
13[1/2]-1[1/2].
Among the crowd was Preston-born Samuel Ryder, a nurseryman who made
his fortune selling penny seed packets and was Mayor of St Albans in
1905.
Ryder laid on a champagne party after that second unofficial match and
British captain George Duncan said: ''Why don't we make it a regular
event? Would you present a trophy?'' Ryder did and the rest is history.

THE five Ryder Cup rookies on the US team have the nightmarish images
burned into their brains.
They see Fred Couples with his visor pulled down over tear-filled eyes
in 1989 and Mark Calcavecchia horribly topping his shot into water on
the seventeenth at Kiawah Island in 1991.
There is Bernard Langer grimacing in unspeakable agony after missing a
short putt on the final hole at Kiawah that would have kept the Cup in
European hands.
Close their eyes and they see Costantino Rocca leaving the eighteenth
green at The Belfry in tears after blowing a one hole lead with two
holes to play in the deciding match of 1993.
These scenes of suffering, replayed on TV and reprinted in papers, are
constant reminders of the gruelling pressure of the Ryder Cup, haunting
thoughts for the five untested Americans to take onto Oak Hill Country
Club when competition starts today.
''I think it was Tom Watson who told Davis Love it was the only golf
tournament in the world that made his knees shake,'' said Sam Torrance,
who has played in seven Ryder Cups for Europe, before practising in a
chilly drizzle that made the Europeans feel right at home.
''It's a hyper-tension tournament.''
Until now, the intensity of the Ryder Cup was something Phil
Mickelson, Loren Roberts, Tom Lehman, Jeff Maggert, and Brad Faxon
watched on TV and dreamed of experiencing.
''We're going to get out there and we're all going to be shaking like
a leaf,'' said Faxon said after finishing his practice round.
''You can't really fight the nervousness.''
The rookies also know the Ryder Cup has gone from being played in
virtual obscurity during the years of US domination to attracting
worldwide attention since Europe won the Cup in 1985 and '87 and kept it
with a tie in '89.
''When I played in my first one in 1983 at Palm Beach there were about
a thousand people out there on Sunday,'' said Curtis Strange. Losing the
Cup changed all that.
''It was very much like the America's Cup,'' Corey Pavin said. ''The
United States had it forever and when we lost it everybody got
interested.''
Davis Love said that in 1985 Americans had two questions about the
Ryder Cup: What is that and why did we lose it?
Now most sports fans, not just golf fans, know what the Ryder Cup is,
and they know why the United States lost it: Seve Ballesteros, Nick
Faldo, Bernhard Langer, and Ian Woosnam.
That core group of Europeans have all played in at least six Ryder
Cups and they are back this year, along with Torrance and Mark James,
who has played in six Ryder Cups, and Howard Clark, who has played in
five.
There are only two rookies on the European team -- Philip Walton and
Per-Ulrik Johansson.
Lanny Wadkins, captain of the US team, naturally downplays his squad's
lack of Ryder Cup experience.
''I don't think they are as concerned with the pressure and atmosphere
as much as they are getting used to the golf course,'' he said.
But Wadkins admitted experience was a consideration for his first-day
foursome pairings.

SELECTOR RUGBY UPDATE: By SEAN LINEEN of Scottish Rugby
THE most worrying piece of information gleaned as we make our first
form assessment from the thousands of entries for Herald Selector Rugby,
is that the national team should be picked by a woman.
You may think this is pure fantasy, but out in front, a red rag to all
male chauvinist selectors, is Gail Steele, from Dumfries, leading the
table after four rounds of competition.
The most popular choice of player was Dundee HS FP and Scotland lock
Stewart Campbell, with almost half the entries carrying his name. Second
favourite was Herald columnist Kenny Logan, no doubt helped by the 43
entries submitted by a certain K Young!
The favourite team of the fantasising selector is:
Gavin Hastings; Kenny Logan, Tony Stanger, Graham Shiel, Gary Parker;
Craig Chalmers, Gary Armstrong; Alan Watt, Kevin McKenzie, Peter Wright,
Stewart Campbell, John Jeffrey, Rob Wainwright, Kevin Armstrong, Adam
Roxburgh.
It is interesting to note that this team would come nowhere near the
one with which Gail leads our table. It's not all beer and skittles
being a rugby selector!
As you can see, somehow the White Shark has found his way into the
team as a lock. Both to improve his looks, keep him from instructing
referees, and being permanently offside.
Ally Donaldson -- top individual points scorer so far -- is also
fourth in the Selector table, having confidently picked himself in his
team. No wonder Currie are doing well. And he certainly wouldn't be a
bad standby to have if he does happen to win the trip to New Zealand to
follow the Scottish team next May.
A few entries were disqualified for breaches of the competition rules.
If you have any queries (but not if you just want to know your score,
please) telephone 01463 714792.
The first winner of the Herald Rugby Selector Competition, winning
#500 and a case of champagne, will be published in The Herald next week
. . . Good luck!

GARY Jacobs, the former undefeated European welterweight champion,
will appear in a Glasgow ring for the first time in 18 months, when he
leads the undercard at the Kelvin Hall on November 18, the night Irvine
light-flyweight Paul Weir defends his WBO world title against South
Africa's Baby Jake Matlala.
It is less than four weeks since Jacobs fought and lost a tough battle
with WBC welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker in Atlantic City, but
now, after a family holiday in Florida, the Glasgow boxer is ''eager to
get the show back on the road.''
A meeting with Whitaker, regarded by most as the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world, was something of an obsession with Jacobs. ''You
just can't buy experience like that,'' he said. ''But now, having fought
so many times outwith my own country, I want to box regularly in
Glasgow.
''I went the way I wanted to go and that was a fight with Whitaker.
Now that road A is closed off, I will pursue path B, and that could be a
fight with WBO holder Eamonn Loughran, of Ireland.
''My mental attitude is right and I will still win a world title --
that's a promise. I will not give up until I am champion. But my main
concern now is the fight on November 18, and I don't care which opponent
promoter Tommy Gilmour brings in. I'm also delighted to be on the same
bill as Paul Weir, and I hope he has a successful defence against
Matlala, who is a very difficult opponent.''
Tommy Gilmour admitted to being delighted to be working with Jacobs
again -- he co-promoted the welterweight's first major title win against
Wilf Gentzen for the Commonwealth crown -- and promised to help him get
his wish of fighting more often in Glasgow.
Said the promoter: ''I hope that by putting Gary back on the winning
track I can persuade Loughran's manager Barry Hearn, who is also a
partner of mine, to put the world title fight on in Glasgow sometime in
February or March. I talk daily with Barry, but if we can persuade
Loughran to come out of Belfast it won't be through friendship, it will
be as a result of the momey we will be putting up.''
Gilmour hopes to announce Jacobs' opponent for November 18 in the next
couple of weeks, and he also announced that Tranent's Willie ''The
Mighty'' Quinn will defend his WBO Continental middleweight championship
on the same bill, against an opponent still to be named.

JOHN Higgins, the local hero, went out of the Regal Masters last
night, beaten in a deciding frame by Ronnie O'Sullivan after a highly
exciting quarter-final for an appreciative audience at Motherwell Civic
Centre.
Higgins could not disguise his disappointment at defeat by 6-5 after
having led 4-1 and 56-0 in the sixth frame and, somewhat inaccurately,
described it as a scrappy contest. In contrast, the talented but
enigmatic O'Sullivan said it had been a good match and agreed that he
had pulled off a great escape.
Asked about their rivalry, the 19-year-old said he did not enjoy
playing Higgins. ''He's too good,'' he said with a smile, adding that he
preferred easy matches.
Higgins, clearly angry with himself, complained: ''Ronnie played
terrible as well. He played some crazy shots. I don't know whether he
was mickey-taking or what. But he's through, and I'm not.''
The turning point was in the sixth frame, in which the 20-year-old
Scot compiled a break of 56 which should have been more. The Essex
player hit back with a break of 41 and later clinched the frame with a
run of 22 to the pink, which he bravely potted when most players would
have opted for safety.
That's the way O'Sullivan plays, and it had not worked earlier. Breaks
of 31, 30, 50, and 71 were sufficient for Higgins to go 4-1 up with
O'Sullivan's break of 80 in the second frame -- which lasted only five
minutes -- being the only flash of his ability.
After his comeback in the sixth frame, the world No.3 put together a
delightful 96 and followed up with a 71 to level the match.
Higgins won an error-strewn tenth frame with a run of 36 to force a
decider, in which he led but surrendered the initiative, and O'Sullivan
sealed victory with a run of 35 to the pink.
Following the early departures of John Parrott and Jimmy White, former
world champion Steve Davis bowed out yesterday, beaten 6-3 by Darren
Morgan.
The Welshman might have won 6-1 but survived a typical Davis fightback
and now awaits the winner of tonight's match between the world
championship finalists, Stephen Hendry and Nigel Bond.

VOLVO announces its new model-year specifications well in advance, so
that the 1996 versions of its existing range are already in the
showrooms. While just as robustly built, and as obsessed with occupant
protection, as the other big cars in the Swedish company's catalogue,
the 850 confirmed on a recent test drive that this is one for the keener
driver.
The 850's side impact protection system -- a crash-absorbing structure
rather than just simple door bars -- is one of its major features, but
this was also the first volume production saloon or estate in the world
to be equipped with side-mounted airbags.
There is a kind of grid pattern of 850 models from #17,525. As well as
the entry level ''platform car'' with its five-cylinder, two-litre,
ten-valve engine, there is a 20-valve alternative, then the same choice
of valve gear in the 2.5-litre size, and finally the roasting 2.3-litre
turbo giving the T-5 variant, which peaks at 225bhp, a potentially
higher performance than most owners will happily cope with on a regular
basis.
Matching this choice of engines, there are two separate equipment
ranges -- the sports range in the S model and, ultimately, in the GLT.
The luxury/comfort range includes the SE and the CD. With a #26,575
maximum, it is almost a matter of selecting a square on the table of
prices, power and equipment levels, and designing your 850 for yourself.
On the road, a 2.5-litre 20-valve GLT saloon I tried, at a showroom
price of #23,575, was much more responsive, both to the throttle and in
its handling, than Volvos of the pre-850 era. One important point is the
''feel'' provided by the rear suspension, which also sorts out the ride
quality on jittery road surfaces.
Like all the big Volvos, the 850 has a remarkably tight turning
circle. Its interior is, by today's fashion standards, rather lumpishly
designed. There are some gawky angles -- but then, a curvaceous interior
would look weird inside the uncompromising body style.
The manual transmission GLT will reach 60mph in just over nine
seconds, which is brisk for a car of its size and weight. Its
theoretical maximum is almost 125mph, while the sturdiness of the build
is hinted at in fuel consumption returns like 44mpg at 56mph, 34 at 75
and 21mpg around town.
I suspect that, as has been the case since the 120 series and before,
it is not so much the performance or economy statistics which attract
Volvo owners, as the solid build quality and almost unburstable feel. In
the true Swedish manner, this is very much a family car for the long
haul.

SCOTLAND savoured a sensational 9-1 singles success against Wales at
Royal Portrush yesterday to give themselves an excellent chance of their
first victory in the Home Internationals since 1986. All that is
required is a comfortable win against England today.
Palacerigg player Graham Rankin capped a fightback from a 3-2 morning
deficit when he rolled home a 25-foot birdie putt across the final green
to beat Mark Smith, of Ross-on-Sea, by one hole. Entering the final day
the match is precariously poised as each nation has recorded one victory
and one defeat.
The 27-year-old followed eight similar scores by his fired-up
countrymen. So on form were Scottish Amateur champions Hugh McKibbin and
Simon MacKenzie that they covered their ties in six and five under par
respectively. Only an out-of-sorts Gordon Sherry failed.
Alan Reid, maintained his unbeaten record along with Craig Watson, of
East Renfrewshire, his playing partner in the morning foursomes, thanks
to a hot putting streak.
In the other match, defending champions England salvaged some broken
pride with a 9-6 victory over on-form hosts Ireland. Similarly, they
dominated the afternoon matches, losing only three. Wales v Scotland
details (Welsh names first):
Foursomes -- G Houston (Flint) and C Rees (Ashburnham) beat B Howard
(Cochrane Castle) and A Turnbull (Innerleithen), 2 holes; D Park
(Burghill Valley) and M Peet (Pyle and Kenfig) lost to S Gallacher
(Bathgate) and S MacKenzie (West Linton), 2 holes; B Dredge (Bryn
Meadows) and N Edwards (Whitchurch) beat G Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie)
and G Rankin (Palacerigg), 3 and 2; M Ellis (Wrexham) and M Smith
(Ross-On-Sea) beat H McKibbin (Troon Welbeck) and R Beames (Wick), 1
hole; C Evans (West Mon) and Y Taylor (Brynhill) lost to A Reid
(Kilmarnock Barassie) and C Watson (East Renfrewshire), 3 and 1.
Singles -- Houston beat Sherry, 4 and 3; A Harrhy (Llanwern) lost to
MacKenzie, 5 and 4; Dredge lost to Howard, 1 hole; Smith lost to Rankin,
1 hole; Edwards lost to Turnbull, 4 and 3; Rees lost to Watson, 6 and 5;
Taylor lost to McKibbin, 4 and 3; Evans lost to M Brooks (Carluke), 3
and 1; Peet lost to Beames, 3 and 2; Ellis lost to Reid, 1 hole.

* A GREAT advantage of motoring in Scotland is how many places to
visit -- castles, museums, monuments, parks, countryside walks, and so
on -- can be packed into a fairly short drive through attractive
landscapes.
This mini-tour, of about 22 miles, starts at Causewayhead just north
of Stirling, loomed over by the Wallace Monument on the wooded Abbey
Craig, with a backdrop of the Ochil Hills.
From the roundabout in Causewayhead, go up Logie Road, signposted to
the Wallace Monument. Open daily in September and October, then at
weekends in November, this majestic 220ft tower, with no fewer than 246
steps to the top viewing platform, has exhibition rooms on different
floors, as well as a stunning outlook west towards Ben Lomond.
Turn left along the A91 through Blairlogie, Menstrie and Alva. From a
car park beyond the side road to The Square, a walk back along the
pavement, and into a footpath at Puddleducks tearoom, leads into the
charming village of Blairlogie, once known, from its famous health-food
product, as Goat's Milk Spa.
Menstrie Castle displays the armorial bearings of the baronets of Nova
Scotia. The castle is open on weekend afternoons till the end of
September.
In Alva, the history of the mill towns of the district is intriguingly
told in the Mill Trail Visitor Centre, open daily. Alva Glen is a deep
ravine with shaded woodland walks, towering falls and, higher up,
pathways climbing steeply on to the open hillside.
Leaving Alva, go straight on at a crossroads and immediately left into
the Ochil Hills Woodland Park. There are footpaths and a children's
playground, a visitor centre in the restored stables block of Alva
House, and a coffee shop which is a favourite howff, early and late in
the day, of hang-gliders who soar on the thermals high above.
Return to the main road, turn right and immediately left for
Fishcross. Left at a T-junction into Fishcross, then right at a
crossroads and continue into Sauchie. Take the road on the left (a
breeding ground for ''sleeping policemen'') to Gartmorn Dam Country
Park. There is a pleasant three-mile stroll around a trout-stocked
reservoir, as well as another visitor centre, shorter walks, and relics
of the old local coal-mining industry.
Return to the main road in Sauchie and turn left. Watch for a sudden
right turn, in the middle of a left-hand bend, onto the B908 as for
Alva. Follow signs for Tullibody and then for Stirling, then straight on
at Manor Powis roundabout, into a 30mph limit, and turn left to
Cambuskenneth.
This very attractive village stands across the River Forth from
Stirling, connected to it only by a footbridge. Cambuskenneth Abbey,
open daily except on Sunday mornings till the end of September, is the
burial place of James III, feeblest of the Stuart kings. His story is
told here.
Back to the main road, turn left and return to the roundabout in
Causewayhead.

SUSAN Fraser, the Scotland and Great Britain player, is Bonagrass
Grove's only doubt for the vital match in the women's National League
against defending champions Western Klick Photopoint on Sunday at
Forthbank.
Fraser, who trained with Great Britain at Lilleshall this week, is
still being restricted by an ankle injury sustained in the recent
international match with world champions Australia.
Audrey Sime, the Bonagrass captain, did concede yesterday that while
she ''might not start the game, she is likely to be on the bench to be
available for penalty corners.''
It is, of course, vital to the Taysiders that the highly experienced
Fraser is able to make a contribution, for Western, who pipped Grove for
the title last May on goal difference, appear to have lost none of their
efficiency as their 10-0 drubbing of Boroughmuir proved last week.
Meanwhile, there will be no shortage of quality matches in the men's
National League this weekend. The pick of the bunch is likely to be at
Countesswells in Aberdeen tomorrow when two of the country's principal
exponents of attacking hockey, Touche Ross Gordonians and Western clash.
The message from both camps is that the contest ''is going to be
tight''. But each of them presents genuine claims for victory between
two of the younger sides in the league. Roddy Philp, the captain of
leaders Western, feels ''our fitness could be decisive'' while Touche
Ross's Richard Freeland argues they could have the advantage because
''we have four senior internationalists in our ranks and our players are
that bit older''.
In the end both just might be happy with a share of the points.

MAREDO OPEN
EVELYN Orley, from Switzerland, broke a congested leaderboard when she
came in with a six-under-par 67 to lead the field after the first round
of the Maredo Open at Trudelberg, Hamburg, yesterday.
Orley wedged to 12 feet from 50 yards for a birdie at the last hole to
lead by one stroke from a group inlcuding Scotland's Julie Forbes. Dale
Reid was one behind on 69 to strengthen Scotland's attempt at a first
Tour win of the season.
''It was difficult early on with the dew on the ground,'' said Forbes.
''I left five putts on the lip of the hole but I will settle for a 68. I
hit the ball really well.''
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
67 -- E Orley (Switzerland).
68 -- J Forbes, M-L de Lorenzi (France), B Pestana (S Africa), W
Doolan (Australia).
69 -- D Reid, C Duffy, P Sterner (Sweden), F Pike (Australia).
70 -- S Mendiburu (France), R Carriedo (Spain), J Soulsby, L Brooky
(New Zealand), P Rigby (Sweden), J Allmark (Sweden).
Other Scottish scores: 73 -- C Panton-Lewis. 74 -- L Irvine. 76 -- T
Craik. 77 -- G Stewart. 78 -- M McKinlay.

GHK's euphoria after their 93-5 win over Stewart's Melville last
Saturday has been dissipated in the past week. Their pack has been left
without experienced big men as two locks, Kenny Wilson and Cecil du
Plessis, have gone abroad.
Wilson, who made his district debut for Glasgow last season, is on
holiday, and du Plessis has been summoned back to South Africa to join
the Eastern Province squad for the Currie Cup competition's last three
weeks.
In addition, two international forwards, Shade Munro and Alan Watt,
are unavailable because of injury. So is another of GHK's locks, Dom
Mellor.
Du Plessis, who scored one of GHK's 14 tries against Stew-Mel, was
recalled to South Africa only three days ago, but is expected back in
Glasgow next month. ''He promised he would return,'' Andrew Little,
GHK's director of rugby, said yesterday. ''He said he would be here for
the Currie game.''
That match, though, is four weeks tomorrow. Against Kelso at Old
Anniesland, GHK have paired Neil Adams and Scott Hutton, the former
making a rare appearance in the first XV, the latter switched from wing
forward. As compensating bonuses, however, Murray Wallace and Andy Ness
return to the back row after injury absences.
Stew-Mel's reaction to the thumping by GHK has been to make five
changes in the pack as well as two enforced alterations in the back
division. Alan Kittle, the tight-head prop who was on Scotland's tour in
Zimbabwe during the summer, has been dropped, as has Ross McNulty, who
played loose head for Edinburgh last season.
John Lonergan, West's Glasgow flanker, returns to the Burnbrae club's
back row, but his district colleague, David McKee, has gone from the
threequarter line, as has Alan Hogarth. McKee aggravated a leg injury
during the defeat by Currie last week, and Hogarth slips down to the
second XV so that he can play in his preferred position at scrum half.
Kenny Harper, the North and Midlands scrum half, returns for Stirling
County after injury as the defending champions seek a Meggetland victory
over Boroughmuir to set themselves up for the game against the
Barbarians at Forthbank on Tuesday.
Boroughmuir have lost Nick Mardon and Steve Wands because of injuries.
Duncan Macrae has switched to full back to replace Mardon, who will be
out of rugby for up to four weeks with cracked ribs, and though Wands
will be absent for perhaps only one Saturday, because of a sprung
shoulder, Boroughmuir have had to shuffle the pack's back five to cover
for him.
Darren Burns shifts from lock to open side, and Graham Hepburn returns
in the second row.
Watsonians, joint leaders with Boroughmuir and Melrose, have recast
their front row for the visit to Hawick, with Tom Smith switching from
tight head to the left, Stuart Mather returning on the right, and Grant
McKelvey making his league debut for the club. McKelvey, the former
Haddington hooker, is needed because of Si Farland's knee injury.
Glasgow Southern, chasing Kimarnock, the fourth-division leaders, give
Rian Anderson his senior debut against Edinburgh Wanderers at Braidholm.
* THE Barbarians have been forced to make a change in their team to
play Stirling County next Tuesday at Forthbank Stadium due to Cameron
Glasgow's lack of fitness. Pob Subbiani, the flying winger from Bedford,
is to take his place.
Sabbiani, who first impressed for the East Midlands against the
Barbarians, is rated as a future England prospect and will now join
captain Gavin Hastings' men for their game in front of the Princess
Royal.

THOSE regular debates about whether men are better drivers than women,
or the other way round, are a waste of time. Generalisations on this
subject are worthless, because there are expert, average and dud drivers
of both persuasions.
My own experience is that there are plenty of very good women drivers
around who are as keen on the actual act of driving as anybody else.
What do they think about men at the wheel? Something women particularly
object to is being intimidated, often by drivers of much heavier
vehicles than their own.
For instance, one of my friends has a daily commuting journey using
part of the M74's single-lane roadworks: ''When I'm driving along there
at the permitted 50mph, there is often a man driving a bus or lorry,
applying and releasing the air brakes, sitting on my back bumper at
52mph. What does he want me to do -- fly?''
That same friend has no general objection to lorry drivers, regarding
the best of them, in the old style, as Knights of the Road. But there
are exceptions:
''The biggest bullies on the road? The drivers from that haulage firm
which did great business during the miners' strike, running the gauntlet
of the pickets at the colliery gates. Their manners have never
changed.''
Another woman driver I know cannot fathom the mentality of men who
object to seeing her in front: ''They often come steaming past at 50mph
in a 40mph area I use regularly, go on doing the same speed along the
next bit of derestricted road, and then, when I overtake them in turn,
immediately roar past again, away over the limit, as if to show who's
the boss.''
There is a dislike, too, of boy racers: ''I notice they don't usually
join their local car clubs, where their lack of skill would be shown
up.''
Well . . . sometimes they do join a car club and get a red face. I
remember a sprint meeting where a driver like this in a tuned-up Escort
Twin Cam was soundly beaten by a girl competing in the Fiesta she used
every day travelling to her job as a nurse. She had the expertise, he
just had a heavy right foot, and I hope he got the message.
Women in amateur motor sport seem generally to get on well with their
male rivals. Certainly, there are several girls dicing away regularly in
the Scottish sprint and hill climb championships, all part of the
friendly paddock scene. Men do not come the tough guys there. At
international rally level, I never heard of Louise Aitken-Walker from
Duns being described as anything other than a very tough, and brave,
competitor. The men regarded her, in a manner of speaking, as one of the
boys.
Back with ordinary road driving, why is it that when men see a woman
driver slowing up, they often seem to think she has just lost the place?
''On one regular journey,'' she says, ''I have to turn left off a
70mph dual carriageway, into an abrupt little side turning which not
many people realise is there. It has a very short deceleration lane, so
I always signal in lots of time, with the idea of allowing the following
traffic to make plans to overtake me. But so many men in other vehicles
think I'm simply dithering around, and don't seem to understand that I'm
slowing for the turn, until I get to the stage of drawing in my elbows,
and my breath, as a lorry and a bus try to barge past at the same time.
''That has happened several times recently, and it's not funny.''
Men can also be a bit of a pest to women who share a car with them,
either as two drivers, at different times, of the family car, or when
the man is driving and the woman is a passenger.
''If I drive the car after he's been away with it, the handbrake has
usually been yanked on so hard I almost need a sledgehammer to release
it. And I notice that while I like to operate in the top half of the
fuel gauge, he leaves the car with the needle slumped into the red.
Guess who buys the petrol!
''I don't mind him talking while he's driving, but I wish he wouldn't
wave his arms around while he's doing it. Or peer over his shoulder to
chat to people in the back seat, instead of just glancing at them in the
mirror.''
Myself, I do not drive a lorry or a bus. I have no objection to being
overtaken by a woman driver, and I try to allow for people jouking off
into unexpected side-roads. But I am in that list somewhere.

BOAT shows are a major attraction these days, showcasing the latest,
the biggest and the best.
Kip marina is holding its eighth national second-hand boat show next
month, with an under-cover powerboat show as well from October 13 to 15.
A show with a difference is the Scottish Boat Jumble, a one-day event
at Irvine, on October 8. Anything goes, new or second-hand, with traders
coming from all over Britain.
The general chandlery market is facing increased competition, with a
range of up-to-date items. The days of literally having to hook up
buttons on oilies are long past.
As Eleanor Nelson, Duncan's managing director, points out: ''Garments
are much more fashion orientated, as well as functional. If you sweat
and cannot get rid of condensation, you get cold and miserable.
''Now, you can wear the three-layer system -- thermal underwear,
middle layer, and ''breathing'' jacket and trousers.
Looking at hardware and electronics, shop manager Kenneth Rennie
reports that, over the past 10 years or so, global plotting system
equipment has taken over from Decca/Loran in navigation. Accuracy can be
to 25 metres or so, anywhere on the earth.
Prices have been tumbling with increased sales, and the #200 barrier
has now been broken. There are also fluxgate compasses, which can
''talk' to waterproof cockpit instruments. Satellite TV is naturally on
the boating list as well.
Night school courses are getting under way, and class books, charts
and navigation instruments are popular choices.

ONE of the authentic heroes of motor-racing in the 1950s was Archie
Scott Brown, born in Paisley but working in Cambridge, for a while as a
tobacco sales rep for George Dobie and Sons. He was a tiger at the wheel
of any competition car, from an Austin A35 to a Formula One Connaught,
but especially in the Lister-MG, the Lister-Bristol and finally the
magnificent Lister-Jaguars built by a Cambridge engineering company.
He scored more than 70 outright victories, and his death from
virtually untreated burns, after an accident in 1958 at Spa, caused deep
sadness throughout the motor-sport community.
Archie favoured a flamboyant driving style -- power-sliding some of
the fastest sports cars of their era in majestic displays of balance and
control. Robert Edwards's book Archie and the Listers, published by
Patrick Stephens at #17.99, captures all of that, and his many race wins
against drivers of the highest calibre, but goes much more deeply into
the story of a truly remarkable man.
Archie was a wee fellow. It was odd, in retrospect, that photographs
usually showed him with his right hand in his pocket, or hidden by yet
another trophy. As Robert Edwards explains, the real glory of Scott
Brown's career, and his life, was not simply that he was such a
successful driver. At the same time, he was severely disabled.
During her pregnancy, his mother contracted rubella -- German measles.
The consequences to her child were disastrous. Archie was born with ''no
proper right forearm, merely an elementary thumb and palm, which started
below the elbow. A similar condition affected both legs, but marginally
less badly. Neither leg had a shinbone; only a fibula. Both legs were
radically twisted and bowed, and the club-feet were tiny, with no
discernible toes. The right foot was twisted outwards about 90 degrees,
and the left was almost back to front.''
As he grew up, Archie had other problems when his parents separated.
Yet, thanks to dedicated surgery, inspired schooling and colossal will
power, he developed into a major sporting figure whom his contemporaries
held in high regard.
Robert Edwards weaves the various strands of this biography
effortlessly together. There are race reports and design details of the
various Listers, accounts of Brian Lister who built them and Don Moore
the expert engine tuner. Well-known figures of 1950s racing like Moss
and Fangio, Parnell and Salvadori, and Briggs Cunningham in the States,
make their appearance.
Roy Salvadori, a great rival, recalls that Archie, having won a race,
would self-deprecatingly say, ''my car was quicker''. Ecurie Ecosse and
its patron David Murray also come into the story, by no means always to
their credit.
Just how strong Archie had made his disabled body is shown in his
party trick of doing 20 one-handed press-ups in succession. His bad days
as well as his good ones are described, and how he could cocoon himself
against shocks like the temporary withdrawal of his competition licence,
when he was already a race winner, because of a protest about his
disability by somebody else in the sport.
The eerier aspects of the final crash at Spa are described. Like so
many other similar incidents in motor-racing, it seemed to have been
prefigured. And although this is an unusual response to any motoring
book, I had a lump in my throat when reading of how Archie's father
scattered his son's ashes on Arran, beside the waters of the Firth of
Clyde where they had sailed together in earlier and happier times.

Stewart Fraser goes aboard a fun boat which is laughing at its larger
rivals
FUN boats are the in-thing these days -- try out the new Sigma 8m and
you soon find why.
Boats like the Sigma 8m (26ft 3in) and the Melges, at 24ft, are small
enough to move around the country and large enough to take four in
cruising comfort.
And boy, can they move. The question seems to be which is the faster
-- a symmetrical or asymmetrical spinnaker? In the inevitable light
winds of late, it was frustrating to move gently out of Rhu in a bland
Force 1. With her 115% Mylar jib on a fractional rig, and loose-footed
271sq ft main, she handled like a king-size dinghy.
No undue heeling from crew movement, the lifting keel with torpedo
gives a ballast ratio of just over 36%. A single set of spreaders are
swept aft. The rigging is unfussy, and takes full benefit of the 8ft 2in
beam.
Two Harken 32s look after the lines, from multi-jammers on the
coachroof. The mainsheet traveller divides an exceptionally long cockpit
with two stainless steel footbars below. Further foot support is usually
added on an individual basis.
A swan-neck bend to the tiller, like something from a canal long boat,
caused some uncertainty. Doing a clean tack, in freshening wind, found
the reason.
It saves interfering with the back stays, and it gives room for the
helmsman to step across without stumbling. Simple, when you think of it.
All part of a clever design.
Reaching in 10 knots of wind, it seemed like a good time to try the
spinnaker. Why not the big one, at 818 sq ft, then. Ordinary in the
sense of being symmetrical, with pole balancing the boom. No problem to
raise, and providing lots of urge.
With a waterline of near 23ft, we should never have made 7-8 knots.
But we did. Exhilarating stuff. If only there had been proper weather,
the kind the racing boys go for, we could have looked to surf along at a
possible 20 knots. Now, that's moving.
With the boat, galley and toilet fittings are available as options.
Emphasis is placed on items like a polyester sandwich over PVC core for
hull and deck. For rudder and keel fin from carbon fibre and epoxy
resin.
The toerail comes from joining hull to deck. The coachroof moulding
has a small ledge for jib track and winch base. Sheets get a clean lead.
Natural stability comes in about 15%, and she appreciates a slight
easing off going to windward.
In only her second season in the Clyde, the Sigma 8m is proving
popular with both individuals and groups looking for close racing. It
must be galling to be on a 35-footer and be overhauled by a relative
tiddler. Great fun for the Sigmas, though.
There are nine in Scotland, with eight on the Clyde and 18 in total in
the UK. They have been winning points handsomely, from Burnham and Cowes
to the West Highland Week and the Three Peaks Race.

* WHILE other makes and models have their admirers, the archetypal
British vintage sports car is the 4.5-litre Bentley. W O Bentley built
his cars to last, and a remarkable number of them are still on the road,
carefully catalogued by the Bentley Drivers' Club.
Brian and Marion Hopkins own, and have driven for many years in races,
sprints and speed hill climbs, a Bentley which is unique. The factory
built no more than eight short-chassis 4.5-litres, and this is the only
known survivor with a three-seater Harrison body, restored in the 1980s.
It was first registered in 1929, but the car's documents and the
records of the BDC disagree about who the first owner was. There is a
mystery about why it had Brooklands seats and Brooklands handicap lead
weights installed, and there is a possibility that it raced at the
Weybridge track before being handed over to its first official owner.
The car came to Scotland in 1939, and spent the next 20 years stored
in Larkhall. Then it was sold to an enthusiast in Hastings, which is
where the Hopkinses arrived one November day in 1966 to buy it. Brian
drove it back to Scotland, embarrassingly unfamiliar with the crash
gearbox and also with the central throttle pedal. In the early days they
could not afford a battery for it, and Marion got used to push-starting
the car, which must have been a highly unladylike procedure.
Once, coming back from the Manx Classic, the Bentley blew its engine
to such an extent that ''the pistons were in crumbs.'' During the
rebuild in Edinburgh, it was confirmed that the massive four-cylinder
engine looked as if it had never had a spanner put on it since 1929.
Even the back axle and gearbox still had the factory seals in place. The
rebuild transformed the performance, suggesting that the long lay-up had
somehow clogged the works.
This is a fine-looking car, with 110bhp at its disposal. Acceleration
from rest is not enthralling, but, once on the move, like any decent
vintage Bentley, it will give a good account of itself, cruising at
60mph with the engine turning over at not much more than 2000rpm.
There may be something familiar about this one. It appeared in the
last series of Para Handy on television, and it features in some
high-class Barbour catalogues.

Take-off at the airfield: Ross Finlay gets to grips with the
high-performance range of AMG Mercedes saloons -- and sports car.
WHILE being very dubious about some of the driving antics described
and illustrated in certain motoring magazines -- on the grounds that
they are idiotic when practised on the public highway -- I always enjoy
a test session on private land, where exuberant behaviour at the wheel
is not just tolerated but actively encouraged.
An event like this recently showed off the merits of the
high-performance range of AMG Mercedes saloons and their solitary sports
car counterpart. It should be said that the one which was eventually
''cooked'' was not in the hands of a Scotsman at the time.
Paul Ripley, one of Britain's best known performance driving
instructors, laid out a simulated race circuit on an old airfield, plus
a winding course through pairs of offset marker pylons, and a slalom
with equally-spaced pylons arranged in a straight line. Ripley and his
instructors sat with us to offer advice about tackling the circuit test.
Although one of my colleagues with racing experience had different
ideas about the best cornering lines, something like that ought to be
available to all owners of high-performance machinery. Cars like the AMG
Mercedes may be considered a little over-engineered, but that is no bad
thing, and it would be even better if some ''over-engineering'' were
applied to drivers too.
AMG takes its name from the initials of its founding partners,
Aufrecht and Melcher, and of Aufrecht's home town of Grossaspach near
Stuttgart. Hans-Werner Aufrecht was a Mercedes-Benz test engineer who
left to set up his own business in 1967. Now a range of
limited-production AMG cars is available through Mercedes dealerships,
developed with the factory and retaining the full manufacturer's
warranty.
The entry-level Mercedes is the C-class, inspiration for the C36 AMG
at #39,950. Based on the C280 Sport, it starts on the normal Mercedes
production line. Then AMG carries out a 3.6-litre, 24-valve,
six-cylinder engine transplant, boosting the power to 280bhp, lowering
the 0-60mph acceleration time to something like 6.5 seconds, and raising
the autobahn maximum to a governed 155mph.
Mercedes would never agree to engine alterations alone. The C36
specification also includes lowered and modified suspension, changed
wheel and tyre sizes, and very powerful, dependable brakes. There is
some body restyling, as well as minor changes to the interior, which
retains the exaggeratedly large-diameter Mercedes steering wheel.
Although it was the least expensive car in the fleet, I thought the
C36 was the all-round pick of the bunch. Its more compact dimensions
make it just that touch more manoeuvrable. I liked it best on the
simulated race circuit, where its turn-in was impeccable -- at least at
my own speeds, which were nothing like the highest of the day.
The E36 AMG, sold in saloon, coupe, estate and cabriolet form at
prices from #46,750, is one size up in Mercedes terms, but oddly enough
comes with a slightly less powerful 3.6-litre engine. In some ways the
extra bulk of the E-class, of which a new version will soon be on the
market, makes it less handy as a performance saloon, and it seems very
odd to me that Mercedes, which has a rather fiddly zigzag selector gate
for its automatic transmission -- to make sure the driver does not
either whack it down too many gears or stuff the whole shebang
unintentionally into reverse -- has the zigs and zags going in different
directions in different models.
It was slightly embarrassing to come bombing up to some advised
late-braking point on the circuit, where a manual change down to ''2''
was called for, and start to wonder exactly where ''2'' was located.
Unless you have a Mercedes-packed garage, of course, this hardly
matters.
However, I spent more time with the E36 on the slalom test, going into
the first swerve at about 55mph and latterly coming out of the far end
at about 60mph. It was clear that, if you practise with it, the E36 will
respond accurately to smooth but slight movements of the steering wheel.
I was pleasantly surprised at how it would hurtle through the line of
pylons, almost at the point of sliding its tail but never quite doing
so. This was a good lesson -- that a well-modified car does a lot more
than just set scorching off-the-line acceleration times.
Last of the cars available was the SL60 AMG two-seater with
spectacular looks, a glorious-sounding six-litre 32-valve V8 engine
peaking at 381bhp, a 0-60mph sprint time trimmed to 5.5 seconds, and a
price tag just #50 short of six figures. There is really nothing more to
say except that this is the ultimate Mercedes sports car of the decade.
Out in the real world of main and minor roads, the AMGs proved to be
the best kind of modified car -- entirely untemperamental yet instantly
responsive. The airfield test session may have provided the meat of the
action, but the real message of the day was that these very
high-performance cars have all the engineering integrity which is the
Mercedes hallmark, with immense reserves, not just of performance, but
also of handling, braking, stability and control.
And if the C36 is not the best high-performance saloon in the world,
it will do me to be going on with.

* THE AMG Mercedes road cars described on the front page of this
section were on Bridgestone tyres, and so are the much more highly
modified versions which the works team drivers -- including Dario
Franchitti from Bathgate -- race in the German Touring Car Championship
and the International Touring Championship, the fastest production-based
saloons in Europe.
If Mercedes fits Bridgestone tyres, not only on its race-winning cars
but also on showroom saloons, they obviously satisfy some pretty
exacting requirements. Bridgestone Expedia S-01 supercar road tyres are
also specified by Aston Martin, Ferrari, Jaguar, Porsche, Lamborghini
and TVR.
But how does Bridgestone of Japan rate in terms, not of prestige
contracts but of actual cash turnover, as some fairly minor-league
outfit compared with Michelin, Goodyear and other more familiar names?
In fact, Bridgestone is the world's biggest tyre and rubber company,
with sales last year of something like #10 billion.
It has almost 90,000 employees on six continents, and dozens of
factories in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and elsewhere.
The business started in a modest way in 1931. Just 20 years later the
company began producing Goodyear-branded tyres in Japan. Business
boomed, and by 1988 Bridgestone was big enough to take over Firestone.
Ah -- could that be where the ''stone'' bit of the name came from? No.
Founder Shojiro Ishibashi was one of the few Japanese businessmen of
his time who liked a little joke. His surname translates as Stonebridge,
and to hit the global market he simply turned the syllables round.

IF THE Liberal Democrats feared they had erred in having Mr Ashdown
addressing them early in their conference, thus peaking too soon, they
must have been reassured by Mr Wallace's speech yesterday. It was witty
and forceful and retained a momentum which could easily have faltered.
The outcome has certainly been a successful conference, and though it
may have complicated Lib-Dem relations with Labour that should be
temporary -- the main effect is to have served notice on Labour that
though the Lib Dems can be wooed, their affections cannot be taken for
granted. The conference made clear how much they think of themselves as
an independent force, and Mr Ashdown's strictures on Mr Blair's fiscal
policy underlined that self-confidence. If they are to prove Labour's
partners after an election -- and much will depend on the actual results
-- they will not abandon their distinctive ideas on taxation and on
electoral reform. Mr Blair's expressed doubts about PR will not
themselves lightly be abandoned (and indeed the whole subject will
compel a national debate) and for that reason alone Labour will not
continue to woo the Lib Dems after a General Election if the results
provide it with a clear majority.
How much good the conference will have done the Lib Dems in Scotland
particularly is almost anybody's guess, for there is little doubt that
they must be squeezed hard by all the others. Though it looks as if the
continuing Tory misfortunes in Scotland may allow the retention of the
clutch of Lib-Dem marginals to them, no-one can be sure, especially if
the SNP surges in the Lib-Dem areas. The last election somewhat
over-rewarded the Lib Dems (and Labour) in Scotland and considerably
under-rewarded the SNP. If the latter does better this time, it might
gain a little in all quarters, Argyll being a good example of a seat it
could recover; a seat where individual personality can still allow the
right candidate to defy national trends.
Lib-Dem weakness remains their exclusion from urban Scotland. The
industrial heart of the country is dominated by Labour and there is no
part of it where the Lib Dems are likely to give them a fright, though
the SNP might yet prove to be different -- which is Labour's nightmare.
This conference's success notwithstanding, it is hard to see where fresh
Lib-Dem gains could emerge north of the Border but easy to see where
ground could still be lost.

MERCHANTS who were poised to buy top-class grain from Grampian farmers
before days of incessant rain wiped out hopes of a record harvest have
pledged to do everthing possible to market any grain that can be
salvaged, writes ROBERT ROSS.
''Many of our customers in the Aberdeen area now have little chance of
harvesting more than a small amount of sub-standard grain,'' said Jim
Reed, director general of the United Kingdom Agricultural Trades
Association.
''We believe the way forward lies in all links in the supply chain
being prepared to share the burden of this season in the interests of
long-term trading relationships.''
The Earl of Lindsay, Scotland's agriculture minister, was not prepared
to rule in or rule out the possibility of assistance when he spoke at
the opening of a #1.4m extension to Harbro Farm Sales' Tore Mill in
Inverness.
He did comment, however, that farming was a cyclical business and he
saw the government's job as being to ensure the underlying economic
health of the industry so that it was able to withstand the occasional
localised crisis.

IT'S the sort of proposition that cannot be denied; small firms are
good for the national economy. They should be nurtured, encouraged, and
allowed to play a full part in national reconstruction. So far, so good.
Everybody agrees that the success, and more importantly sustained
success, of small business has a vital part to play in the future. The
trick is to work out ways of helping them without causing unnatural
distortions in the tax regime or labour markets. We have been this way
before. Thatcherism arrived with a built-in agenda for encouraging the
formation of new, small businesses. For a while the drive to create
these opportunities up and down the country went well. Ironically, the
slimming-down of manufacturing industry provided new recruits willing to
use their redundancy money to establish small businesses. Many of them
have survived, some have prospered, but a good number failed to leap
across the successive hurdles of recession, economic instability, and
lack of necessary business skills.
The fact that not everyone has done well should not deter potential
small businessmen. Now that a General Election is relatively near there
has been a sudden rush of politicians anxious to listen to business. It
is probably not a coincidence that Labour's campaign to woo business
leaders has been followed within a day of its launch by yet another
initiative from the Prime Minister. Once again Mr Major is promising to
listen, this time to small businessmen, and to try to renew the impetus
for enterprise. His preferred method of reaching this goal is to lift
the ''burden'' of government from business. This is fine, but only up to
a point. Small businesses labour under a weight of bureaucratic red tape
which could usefully be thinned out. To its credit the Government has
made a start on this and no doubt more initiatives will follow. We do
not quarrel with this. Yet small businessmen, when questioned on what
they want, ask for anything to combat falling sales and the continuation
of the recession. The traditional Tory remedy of removing the burden of
government will not work here. It is the Government's duty to be active
and to develop a stable economic framework in which business can
develop. This is not done by absenting oneself, but by living up to the
responsibilities of office.

TESCO has achieved remarkable growth in Scotland since its acquisition
of Wm Low, and is planning to open at least four new supermarkets over
the coming year, creating nearly 1000 jobs.
Finance director David Reid said yesterday the new stores would be
situated in Dunblane, Falkirk, Inverness and Aviemore. Tesco also hoped
to open two others in the Edinburgh suburb of Colinton and at Cupar in
Fife, he added.
Mr Reid said this investment programme would cost over #30m and lead
to the creation of at least 915 new jobs.
It should also help Tesco to maintain strong growth in Scotland
following a 25% surge in sales at its Wm Low stores during the first
half of this year.
Wm Low suffered a 6% decline in sales during the first half of 1994
before the Tesco takeover, so the sales surge is quite a turnaround.
Tesco bought the Dundee-based chain of 57 supermarkets for #247.7m in
September 1994 after a contested bid with Sainsbury. All Wm Low stores
now trade under the Tesco name.
''It ended up being more expensive than originally planned, but we are
delighted that we have got it, and it has proved a very good investment
for us,'' Mr Reid said.
Marketing director Terry Leahy said the launch of a #35m programme to
refurbish all Wm Low stores was partly responsible for the sharp
increase in sales during the 24 weeks to August 12.
But he also cited the introduction of a wider product range and more
competitive pricing. Tesco offers 20,000 products, whereas Wm Low sold
only 8000.
Mr Leahy said Tesco added about 2,000 new product lines every year and
cited Chinese and Indian foods and chilled soups as recent successful
introductions.
Other factors fuelling higher sales were Lottery card sales, the
introduction of Tesco's Club Card scheme, which offers shoppers a 1%
discount, and a lull in expansion activity by other supermarket groups.
City analysts see sales growth at Tesco's 62 Scottish outlets slowing
to about 19% during the full year. But this is still double the 10%
increase in like-for-like sales achieved in the UK as a whole during the
first half.
The Tesco takeover has been good news for all Wm Low employees, except
for 300 headquarters staff in Dundee who were made redundant.
The application of higher Tesco wage rates gave the 8,000 retained
employees an average wage rise of 12.6%.
These staff have been joined by 1000 new recruits over the past year
as sales have steamed ahead.
Tesco is unconcerned by the possible introduction of a minimum wage,
since its lowest pay rate of #4.27 an hour is already comfortably ahead
of the #4.15 minimum wage demanded by the most militant trade unions.
''We have no real contribution to make on the broad issue of the
minimum wage, except to say that at the levels being talked about it
would not have implications for Tesco,'' Mr Leahy said.
Local suppliers have also benefited from Tesco's higher profile in
Scotland. Tesco outlets north of the Border are expected to order #120m
of goods from Scottish firms this year -- 50% more than Wm Low did in
1994.
Tesco's UK-wide chain of supermarkets is expected to buy #300m from
Scottish suppliers.
Over the past year, Tesco has doubled its market share in Scotland to
14.2%, putting it second equal with Asda behind Argyll -- the owner of
Safeways and Presto -- which has 17.4%.
But Tesco in Scotland still lags behind its overall UK market share of
18.6%. The group remains on the lookout for new acquisitions, but at a
Scottish level these are likely to be on a smaller scale than the Wm Low
takeover.
Tesco makes no secret of the fact that it would like to acquire some
Woolworth sites for conversion into high street stores.
Earlier this week the group announced a 15.1% increase in pre-tax
profits to #290m during the 24 weeks to August 12, on turnover up 25.6%
at #5891m.
Tesco now runs all its Scottish operations from Dundee, with a reduced
headquarters staff of only 20 people. The 12 former Wm Low stores in
northern England have been hived off to other divisions.
Tesco shares ended the day down 4p at 323p.

THE persistent harrying of Cuba by successive administrations in
Washington was perhaps understandable many years ago. The shock of
finding a communist dictator on its doorstep was good for neither
American image nor nerves, and when the said dictator imported Russians
with missiles the breach became both dangerous and absolute. That
situation does not exist now, indeed has not existed for many years.
Cuba is a proud but wrecked country. There is no economy to speak of and
very little national product. Cuba's debts are enormous and its national
institutions, though evidently capable yet of the persecution of those
who disagree with Fidel Castro, are none the less ageing and gap-toothed
dogs. Fidel Castro, whose personal capabilities still run to very long
speeches but precious little else, has tried to open up Cuba to foreign
investment. This was a sensible move, but it has infuriated many
right-wingers in the United States who have embarked, yet again, on a
bout of political action designed to punish Cuba.
The justification for this should escape any reasonable person. It
obviously escapes the Clinton administration which none the less finds
itself relatively powerless to do anything about it. The nub of the
latest assault is a Bill designed to tighten US sanctions against Cuba
by allowing Americans to sue in American courts any foreign companies
which might become involved in property in Cuba which was appropriated
by the Cuban Government. The aim of this is to frighten off foreign
investment in Cuba, and one additional measure threatens aid to Russia
if it attempts to help Cuba. US Secretary of State Warren Christopher
calls these measures ''extreme'', which is something of an
understatement. They are, in fact, malevolent and vindictive. The United
States does itself no good internationally by further persecuting Cuba.

SCOTLAND'S livestock farmers face an expensive winter, according to
feed merchants throughout the country.
The underlying reason for this forecast is that despite the fact that
the UK has enjoyed an excellent harvest, with the notable exception of
the North-east of Scotland, grain stocks both in Europe and throughout
the world are at a 10-year low.
Early estimates suggest that the UK's cereal harvest will be around 21
million tonnes with 14 million tonnes of that being wheat. Quality is
good with high specific weights. This makes UK grain attractive on the
world market, especially to countries such as China and possibly Russia
where the harvest has been the worst for 25 years.
All EU export subsidies have been suspended and UKASTA, the merchants'
trade association, is now pressing hard for the Commission to put a stop
to exports of grain to prevent prices going still higher. Both feed
wheat and barley are around #10 per tonne dearer than at this stage last
year, and this is undoubtedly putting pressure on the price of compound
feeds.
Mike Horsfall, the managing director of North Eastern Farmers which
trades extensively in the northern half of Scotland, commented: ''It's a
very firm cereal market and we will have to make adjustments
accordingly.''
It is not just cereals which are rising in price, protein right across
the board is soaring. Soya in early August was costing compounders #135
per tonne, now six weeks later it is quoted at #160 -- a rise of almost
20%. Fish meal during the same period has risen by 10%.
Jeff Hooper, the deputy general manager with Fife-based Central
Farmers, takes a similar view: ''Soya is leading the way and dragging
everything else up with it, including rape, sunflower and maize glutten.
There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the commodity markets at
present.''
However, there are indications that farmers may for some time at least
be shielded from the worst effects of these increases with the major
national compounders fighting each other for market share.
Clearly the intensive sector will be hard hit by price rises. This
will be bad news for the pig and poultry industries which in recent
months have enjoyed better trading conditions than for some tume.
Milk producers will also suffer with many silage clamps less full than
some farmers might wish. This shortfall in fodder will have to be
balanced by heavier concentrate feeding resulting in reduced margins.
The predominantly arable farmer is not immune from inflation either.
Fertiliser prices are set to rise anything between 5% and 10% in the
coming months. Some of this is due to a sharp upward movement in
phosphate prices. Most phosphate comes from North Africa but there are
several new buyers in the market including China.

EDINBURGH-based Premium Trust increased net asset value by 4.3% to
93.2p during its first full financial year, with its fortunes having
picked up in the second half.
The rise in the Martin Currie-managed investment trust's net asset
value, which relates to the 12 months to end-August, was adrift of the
5.7% advance in the All-Share Index.
However, in the second half, net asset value surged 22.3%, with the
All-Share up only 15.6%.
The total dividend for the year will be 3.0p, after a final payout of
2.0p. An special payment of 0.5p is also being made, as a result of
additional revenue generated from successful bond investments.
Premium Trust's shareholders' funds of #18.5m are supplemented by a
#12.2m interest-free loan from sister company Premium Underwriting, the
Lloyd's corporate underwriter.
At end-August, 64% of the fund was invested in UK equities and 11% was
in UK Government fixed-interest stocks.
The Pacific Basin accounted for 8%, with 6% in Continental Europe, 5%
in North America, and 6% in smaller markets.
Looking ahead, trust chairman Sir Donald Miller believes equity
markets should benefit from continued international economic growth,
against a background of stable interest rates and muted inflation.

CHEMICALS group Laporte foresees continued progress during the next

the building and construction sector is unlikely to recover from the
weakness that affected the last few months.
Pre-tax profits rose 14.3% to #67m on turnover 12.4% greater at #552m,
with the interim dividend increasing from 7.6% to 8.5p.
Chief executive Ken Minton said the commitment to strong and sustained
organic growth had been underpinned by the investments in capital and
acquisitions in the core businesses, and the success in maintaining
historically high margins.

SHARES of department store operator and duty-free retailer Allders
tumbled 26p to 178p when the group warned of a profits shortfall.
Chairman John Pattisson said profits for the year ending this month
were unlikely to match the #25.4m earned in 1993-94. This reflected the
costs of establishing new operations in Charles de Gaulle airport near
Paris and in Copenhagen. Refurbishment of the shops disrupted trading
and the cost offset higher sales elsewhere.
But new businesses in Portugal and New Zealand have traded well and
the international operations have traded in line with expectations.
Mr Pattisson added that the department stores were likely to have made
losses in the second half of the year, with the hot weather further
depressing an already dull trading picture in household merchandise,
though fashion departments did better.
''While the last three weeks have shown some considerable improvement,
sales for the 24 weeks to September 16 have shown no increase over last
year on a like-for-like basis,'' he declared.
However, the Croydon flagship store had made ''good progress'' since
the relaunch in June. New stores scheduled for Nottingham and Handforth
are on schedule.
In June, Allders reported first-half profits up from #11.1m to #16.5m,
but only because of a #3.8m business rate refund.

IN Dingwall tonight, and elsewhere in these pages, James Hunter
addresses himself to how the land question in Scotland should be dealt
with by the devolved Scottish parliament which Labour will create if it
wins the next General Election.
My own hope is that some steps can be taken even more quickly. There
are useful and symbolic actions which would not impinge noticeably on
parliamentary time, while the constitutional legislation is making its
own way through the system.
Perhaps we should even take a leaf out of the Tory book. They have a
favourite trick of introducing an arcane pro-landlord clause into
legislation which, ostensibly, has nothing to do with land.
For instance, the abolition of sporting rates (#2m per year to the
chums) mysteriously appeared while the Local Government Reform
(Scotland) Bill was going through the House of Landlords. It would be
sweet revenge to toss a Maximum Acreage clause into the Minimum Wage
legislation!
Tonight's lecture is in memory of that extraordinary man, John
MacEwen, who emerged as a public figure in his late eighties through his
work on compiling Who Owns Scotland? His researches, which sprang from a
pamphlet for his local Labour Party, ''The Acreocracy of Perthshire'',
kept him active and irascible until near the end of his 106 years.
John's primary demand was for a land register of Scotland. He regarded
this as the absolute prerequisite for radical legislation. The measure
which resulted largely from his efforts in the 1970s created a process
of painful county-by-county slowness which at the present pace should be
completed by the time that I, too, am aged 106.
I have never understood why a date could not be set by which all
persons and companies claiming acreage above a certain minimum were
required to produce title and fill in a form with details of ownership,
both nominal and beneficial. That seems like a modest imposition, though
the call to produce legal title to what they allegedly own would be an
interesting challenge to some of our noblest families.
So let's, in John's memory, have an up-to-date simplified register
well before the year 2000. And if any of the acreocracy do not deign to
fill in the forms, then they would simply forfeit that which they own.
Just as a social security claimant forfeits benefit by not filling in
forms. What could be fairer than that?
Secondly, it should be possible to get rid of the feudal system
without too much ado. It really is an inglorious relic of the William
Wallace era, about which some Scots are so inexplicably romantic. The
Scottish Law Commission has done the donkey work and a draft Bill
awaits. It doesn't go far enough, because it has steered clear of
sporting rights with their Crown complications, but that can be put
right at a later date.
I think Jim Hunter is over-generous in suggesting that getting rid of
feu duties was a step in the right direction. All it did was give
''superiors'' the ability to collect lump sums, instead of annual
dribbles, for which they were very grateful.
Their powers of superiority over ''vassals'' remained intact and are
still exercised in many parts of Scotland -- as I know particularly well
from Arran in my own constituency. Would even the Tories oppose a short,
sharp Bill to abolish the feudal system in the last decade of the
twentieth century?
As a third step towards early reform, we want something which
transfers substantial areas of land to the ownership of the communities
which live on them. It is disappointing that the Assynt precedent has
not been more widely built on, but that is a daunting task for small
communities, particularly if they are unsure about how the law stands.
That is where a most interesting Court of Session ruling, the
Kinlochewe judgment, comes in. Essentially it determined that a crofter
could buy his land under the 1976 legislation and pass it to another
owner (such as a community trust) without forfeiting his status as a
crofting tenant.
This, I know, is esoteric stuff but it essentially means that if
crofting communities want to become their own landlords, the means
exists to do so. The Scottish Landowners' Federation backed off from
appealing against the judgment, presumably because it did not wish to
risk having it enshrined more firmly in law.
Simply by reinforcing what is already existing case law, an incoming
Labour government could create the instant option for crofting
communities to ''do an Assynt'' as of right, and at minimal cost. Backed
up by incentives, that could generate a wave of such initiatives.
Without legislation, encouragement could be given to public bodies
like the National Heritage Memorial Fund to put more money into land
acquisition in the public interest, as it has done recently at
Strathaird in Skye. This is utterly appropriate, since the fund started
life as the National Land Fund, created by the post-war Labour
Government.
These are fine as interim measures, but James Hunter is right to say
that everyone with a serious interest in the land question, including
political parties and local authorities, should now be formulating
comprehensive proposals for the devolved parliament to act upon. But
beware of an excessive search for consensus.
On some issues there is a radical political imperative which is
inevitably lost if too much effort is put into trying to get everyone to
agree about it. As in any society, land reform will only be carried
through by those who know in their guts that there are historic wrongs
to be righted.

THE head of AT&amp;T's plant in Dundee, which supplies 27% of the world's
cash dispensers, yesterday spoke about his hopes for the operation after
it is spun off from the US telecommunications giant.
Jim Adamson, who has overseen the increase in the former NCR plant's
market share from 5% in 1980, sees an opportunity for the plant to
re-focus on its core design and manufacturing operations, free from the
distractions of being part of a massive multinational group.
The Dundee plant comes within the financial delivery systems division
of Global Information Solutions (GIS).
AT&amp;T's plans for GIS, which is being spun off to shareholders, were
announced on Wednesday. These include the transfer of the financial
delivery systems division's headquarters from Dayton, Ohio, to London.
GIS's total workforce is being slashed by 8500 to 34,500 -- a
reduction of nearly 20%.
However, Dundee, GIS's sole producer of automated teller machines
(ATMs), has escaped the worst of the sweeping cuts. The plant's
1400-strong workforce is being cut by 39, with those affected on the
administration and support services side.
Seven of the 100 staff at Dalgety Bay in Fife, where touch-screen
information and transactions equipment is produced, will lose their
jobs.
Elsewhere in the UK, 150 of GIS's 1500-strong servicing, sales and
marketing force are being axed.
Dr Adamson, vice-president of financial delivery systems, believed
good management of the Dundee plant during and after its days as part of
NCR -- the US-based company acquired by AT&amp;T in 1991 for $7500m -- had
enabled it to survive the massive reorganisation virtually intact.
He said: ''We have been a fairly tight organisation. We have made good
profits during the period we have been part of AT&amp;T and we have grown
the business. There were very few parts of Global Information Solutions
that could say that.''
Meanwhile, the decision that GIS will stop production of personal
computers will make Dundee a bigger part of the remaining operation.
Dr Adamson said: ''I expect it (the Dundee plant) to be more
successful and to grow. If we can grow the business then there is a
chance for increasing the number of people.
''It all depends how well the business does. We have got to re-focus
back on the things we are good at.''
The Dundee plant commands 77% of the market in the UK and Eire. Its
customers include Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale
Bank, and TSB, as well as the ''big four'' London clearers: Lloyds,
Barclays, NatWest, and Midland.
Since Dr Adamson joined in 1980, the Dundee plant has moved from being
the ninth-biggest supplier of ATMs in the world to pole position.
AT&amp;T's review of the activities of GIS began in June and the spin-off
was not unexpected.
More surprising was AT&amp;T's decision to split the remainder of the
group into two separate companies, communications systems and
technology, covering the equipment manufacturing side of the business,
and communications services.

David Belcher looks forward to the Ten Day Weekend, which offers loads
of music, some of it free, in 17 venues all around Glasgow
AS we approach Glasgow's inaugural Ten Day Weekend next month, we're
only being mildly boastful in stating that its existence confirms the
dear green place as one of the world's soundest cities.
We can support this bold statement with sundry facts, not the least of
which is that ageless taste-arbiter John Peel enjoyed himself so much in
the Big G last year at Sound City, the Ten Day Weekend's forerunner,
that he's returning between Friday, October 13 and Sunday, October 22 in
order to host one of his live Radio 1 Saturday shows from Queen Margaret
Drive.
Of course, in addition to His Eminent Peelfulness, there will be
big-name performances by Jimmy Somerville, Alison Moyet, and Christy
Moore, with the Ten Day Weekend's status further bolstered by shows
featuring such emergent critical faves as Underworld, the Boo Radleys,
and Alanis Morrissette.
Oh -- and it should also be noted that Glasgow's hipness will be
underlined by the absence of any input whatsoever from terminally
ungroovy erstwhile local laddies Simple Minds, whose manager, Clive
Banks, spurned an offer to be a panellist on one of the Ten Day
Weekend's daytime seminars.
Why? He took the huff after a recent review of the Simpletons' Glasgow
show penned for The Herald by Ten Day Weekend co-organiser John
Williamson. Thankfully, the rest of the British music industry has been
rather more grown-up and supportive -- which is just as well,
considering that the Ten Day Weekend had to be knocked into final shape
very quickly, with six months' work condensed into eight weeks.
As John's working-partner, Julie MacCaskill, explains: ''The two of us
have only been in place since T In The Park at the start of August, and
so we've missed some major sponsorship opportunities. But even in that
short space of time we've been getting 400 inquiries a week . . . from
the punters on our mailing list; from bands, venues, record retailers,
promoters.''
Three of Scotland's most prominent promoters, CPL, DFC, and Regular,
have certainly succeeded in assembling a strong and varied bill of Ten
Day Weekend events for a wide range of Glasgow audiences in a wide range
of venues. ''Last year's big Sound City gigs tended to overshadow the
smaller ones,'' says Julie McCaskill. ''Our aim this year is to have all
the Ten Day Weekend venues busy all week, with people going to two or
three affordable shows per night, rather than just one big gig.
''Glasgow District Council's Performing Arts Department have funded us
with #100,000, which we're using as a subsidy in three ways: to reduce
ticket prices at bigger gigs; to ensure that smaller bands get paid
properly at their gigs; and to market the smaller gigs properly so that
the smaller bands will actually be playing to bigger audiences. That
way, everybody wins.''
Radio Clyde can be adjudged a winner for having stepped forward to
shoulder much of the marketing burden. As well as undertaking live
broadcasts of the event's more mainstream gigs, Clyde will be providing
a commendable daily level of on-air support for non-mainstream shows
that the station wouldn't usually cover.
Meanwhile, Radio 1's weekly Rock Show, piloted ex Glasguensis by John
Cavanagh, will be transmitting the Wildhearts' Barrowland show live, and
thumbs uppermost to Radio Scotland for their commitment to recording
local bands at King Tut's for possible use on future Radio 1 John Peel
progs.
You have to salute the Ten Day Weekend's musical variety, too.
D:Ream's chart-topping kiddie rave-pop at Barrowland. The Pastels
painting King Tut's a tasteful shade of vermilion. Five intensely
tasteful nights of the Bathers at the Tramway. Clubby happenings at a
brand-new niterie, Archaos, formerly the Triangle restaurant in Queen
Street.
At the Arches, you can sample Q-Tex's technoid thuddings or walk up
the gangplank to On The Boat, a special evening with a sea-cruise theme
where the Bhundu Boys, King Salsa, and the Fred Quimby Quartet will be
accompanied by screeching seagulls, a desert island, and limbo-dancing,
plus cabaret and theatricals from Mischief La Bas.
Additionally, there are one-off music-related specials such as NME
Exposed, an exhibition at the Arches presenting 100 images, from the Sex
Pistols to Oasis, captured by New Musical Express photographers Derek
Ridgers, Kevin Cummings, and Steve Double.
Along with practical workshop sessions offering advice and instruction
in musicianly technique, there's a two-day music business training
course, run in conjunction with the Musicians' Union. There's Glasgow
Film Theatre's music-movie season, while the GFT is also home to the Ten
Day Weekend's daily seminars.
Clive Banks might not be there, but there will be words of informed
illumination from designer-turned-muso Pam Hogg; Amy Raphael, author of
Never Mind The Bollocks: Women Re-Write Rock; Linda Kiltie, who runs
23rd Precinct, one of Scotland's leading dance-record emporia; Black
Grape collaborator Stephen Lironi, and (hopefully) Creation supremo Alan
McGee, King's Park's most successful export.
Above all, the Ten Day Weekend offers loads of music, some of it free,
in 17 venues all around the city, from Govan to Castlemilk, Yoker to
Pollok, Easterhouse to Lilybank. Right now, negotiations are underway to
climax the first Ten Day Weekend with a free gig in a tented city-centre
locale.
Will the Ten Day Weekend become an Annual Party With A Year-Round
Presence? We hope so.
* FIVE Herald groovers can each win a survival pack containing various
essential somethings for the Ten-Day Weekend, sir or madam.
There's a Ten Day Weekend 12-track cassette to listen to, featuring
superior local contenders such as Bis, Urusei Yatsura, and AC Acoustics.
There's a limited-edition Ten Day Weekend t-shirt to wear; a
pocket-sized bottle of Kahlua liqueur to drink; samples of Sebastian
hair gel and shampoo to massage into one's barnet . . . and, courtesy of
the Scottish Health Board and the Terrence Higgins Trust, a packet of
condoms to fill with water and throw at Simple Mind Jim Kerr, should he
ever be spotted in Glasgow.
All you have to do is write your name and address on a postcard and
send it to: Free Stuff, Ten Day Weekend, 92 Raeberry Street, Glasgow,
G20 6EG. Provided it arrives there before next Friday, September 29,
it'll go into a draw.

NATIONAL Westminster Bank is putting its US Bancorp subsidiary up for
sale with the City estimating that well over $4000m (#2500m) could be
achieved, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Yesterday it confirmed that it is in preliminary talks with a number
of interested parties and that it has appointed Goldman Sachs as an
advisor.
NatWest shares initially responded by rising 15p to 666p before
falling bcck to close 1p easier on the day at 650p.
Royal Bank of Scotland was caught up in the action with its moving
ahead by 10p before ending just 3p ahead at 456p. The usual story went
the rounds that the Royal would be selling its highly successful
Citizens Financial Group based in New England.
That was denied by a Royal Bank spokesman who said there are no plans
for such a move.
NatWest chairman Lord Alexander made it clear at the time of the high
street bank's half time results in August that Bancorp would be sold at
the right price although at the time there was no up for sale sign
around its neck.
Over the years, NatWest has seemed somewhat ambivalent towards US
retail banking with its having seen massive losses accumulate between
1989 and 1991 and total $889m or around #600m thanks to bad lending on
US property.
But in the last three years there has been a substantial improvement
which encouraged NatWest to sanction Bancorp to make acquisitions last
year at what are considered to be full prices.
It has been paying 2[1/2] times book value whereas the Royal has built
up Citizens at between 1.4 and 1.7 times.
A recent estimate by brokers Smith New Court was that NatWest could
realise $5580 (#3530m) for Bancorp whereas the Royal would achieve the
equivalent of #1120m for Citizens on the basis of both being sold at 1.9
times book value or 31% of its #3660m market capitalisation.

LAURA Ashley, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, turned in a
distinctly disappointing performance in the first six months of the year
with pre-tax profits of just #3m compared with #5.1m previously.
In line with other retailers Laura Ashley's sales suffered in the
summer from the prolonged hot weather although overall sales rose by
11%.
Chairman Lord Hooson said that while the first-half results were
unsatisfactory he was confident that the recent arrival of Ann Iverson
as group chief executive would lead to a more focused retail approach.
Ms Iverson said that whilst there was much to do, fundamental changes
were underway which would ''establish a retail culture which will
fulfill the group's potential and deliver value to shareholders''.
In the UK, sales were strong in both garments and home furnishing
products. Like-for-like sales grew by 14% in the period. Overseas, there
was underlying sales growth of 8% in the US with garments doing
particularly well but this due to high markdowns and increased
promotional activity which impacted profits. The North American
operation is currently being reviewed.
In Continental Europe, sales increased by just 2% with lower garment
sales but there was strong sales growth in Japan. Parfum Laura Ashley
reported substantially higher sales primarily due to its new wholesale
operation in North America.
Higher group sales in the first half were offset by lower intake
margins, greater markdowns, increased distribution costs and a delay in
the group's efforts to restructure overhead-related expenses.
During the period two shops were opened and thirteen were closed
resulting in a total of 430 company managed shops at the end of the
period. Lower levels of capital expenditure and improved working capital
contributed to the group's lower borrowings. Gearing improved to 4% from
10% previously.
Laura Ashley is not alone in the sector in being cautious about its
prospects for the second half. City analysts expect annual profits to
grow to #8m against a #30.6m loss previously. Laura Ashley shares rose
5p to 109p after earlier losses.

HOUSEBUILDING
CONTRACTOR and housebuilder Alfred McAlpine saw its share price
slashed by 36p to 99p at one stage yesterday morning after chief
executive Oliver Whitehead warned that the prevailing highly competitive
conditions would result in further cuts in the contracting business in
the current half year.
He would not specify the scale of the redundancies, adding that
nothing was ruled out -- even withdrawal from general contracting.
However, indications are that the permanent staff has been approximately
halved over the past year to around 500 people, with the outstanding
workload in the 14 months to August down 44% to #107m.
Total UK orders are down one third, with only the upsurge in overseas
contracts able to maintain the overall group total at #386m, or about
the same as in June 1994.
The former chief executive of Babcock International was speaking after
announcing a drop in profits in the six months to June to just #56,000,
compared with #3.1m in the first eight months of last year. Comparison
is therefore complicated as a result of McAlpine changing its financial
year end to December.
However, the interim dividend has been held at 3p as a sign of
confidence for the future.
Mr Whitehead expects construction volume to be lower next year, with
little help in the short term from the Private Finance Initiative. That
now seems to be blocking almost all public sector contract awards, which
first have to be considered for private financing. The division lost
#2.4m from trading during the period.
Somewhat happier were the housing activities, with the bounce coming
mostly from the south-east of England. That brought in #6.1m of
operating profit. Sales were down 5% to 672 units, but average prices
were #5000 higher at #95,000, reflecting in part some high price flats
in Chiswick, London.
But since June there has been a small deterioration in sales and the
outlook is for a shortfall in full year numbers.
McAlpine is out of contracting in east Germany, but its activities in
the US showed a smartly improving trend.
The small slate operations effectively held level pegging in the rump
of the mineral division, following on the sale of the quarrying
interests to Wimpey for #45m. That has helped reduce gearing to 22%,
with debt of #45m.
The shares closed off the bottom at 109p, down 26p. On the assumption
that the full year total is maintained at 7p, the yeld is 8%.

LONDON alto saxophone/guitar duo Speake and Lee are a relatively new
partnership, though you'd hardly notice. They have already struck up a
musical relationship that is compatible and conversational but with just
a hint of tension that stops things from getting too comfortable.
Guitarist Lee, especially, can be spiky in between taking on the role
of bass player, piano accompanist or occasional one-man rhythm section
and despite his studied mien will punctuate a solo with a gleeful
arpeggio. Speake blends a lovely warm alto tone with a detached,
sometimes dispassionate playing style to fine effect and his
improvisations are always lucid and carefully considered.
His solo on Charlie Parker's Relaxing at Camarillo, a potential speed
trap, showed admirable restraint and rather more colour than might have
been expected, yet during his dry delivery of Amazing Grace one was
never quite sure that some Spike Jonesesque frolic wasn't just around
the corner.
The Parker tune aside, they mostly steered away from the standard jazz
repertoire, dipping profitably into the Noel Coward (a beautifully
judged I'll Follow My Secret Heart), Lee's former employer, Michel
Legrand, and Cal Tjader books, and pulling off some impressive unison
playing on Speake's enigmatic and tricky The Accidental Flamboyant. They
round off this brief but enjoyable Scottish visit at the Ramshorn
Theatre tonight.

AT&amp;T's break-up plan set hearts a flutter among followers of the UK
telecommunications scene, with talk that BT and Cable &amp; Wireless would
be worth a lot more if they followed the example of the American
telecoms giant and split into smaller parts.
The argument was that BT could divide itself into three: retail,
network and cellular, while Cable &amp; Wireless could demerge its big Hong
Kong operation, the cable laying business and Mercury in the UK, leaving
the international network.
ABN-Hoare Govett estimated that a demerged BT could be worth 505p a
share rather than the present 414p -- up 5[1/2]p yesterday.
Whilst it might be technically feasible to demerge BT into three
parts, it is difficult to see the group putting forward such a plan. BT
cannot be compared with AT&amp;T as the latter embraces three distinct
businesses: telecommunications, manufacturing of phone equipment and
computing, which nowadays do not fit easily together.
Indeed, it is becoming positively disadvantageous to have them in one
group because competing telephone operators are obviously reluctant to
buy hardware from the same company.
BT did have a go at diversification soon after privatisation, but was
not successful. Now it is a focused telecommunications business with
operations which fully complement one another. In fact, it would be
perverse to break it up. Its dominant position in the domestic market
provides strong cash flow to support its developing overseas side.
Competing in international markets without such backing would be more
risky.
As for C&amp;W demerging Hong Kong Telecom, this has always seemed an
option but it would expose the shortcomings of the rest of the group,
where Mercury has been disappointing after a promising start. The group
itself has consistently rejected talk of demerger.
More likely is the story of AT&amp;T bidding for C&amp;W. The break-up will
leave the rump AT&amp;T with a higher stock market rating due to a pure
telecommunications company, which would come in handy for expanding
internationally, through acquiring the likes of C&amp;W.

MINIATURE disc-drive pioneer Calluna yesterday remained vague about
when it would attain break-even point, even though it said supplier
problems which prevented it meeting its original target of moving into
the black in June were ''substantially behind it''.
When the Fife-based company announced full-year results back in July,
managing director Norman White said he expected break-even at some point
during the current financial year to end-March.
Yesterday, speaking after the hi-tech company's annual meeting, he
said everything at Glenrothes was in place to meet this projection.
However, Dr White added that the position depended on the performance
of Calluna's component suppliers during the next few months.
He said: ''At this stage, we would not want to make a projection as to
when the break-even would occur. The problems of the summer have
obviously had an impact on that.
''When we put our interims out, we will probably speak in a more
detailed way.''
Problems with the supply from the Far East of a key component for
Calluna's highest capacity, 260-megabyte disc-drive have now been
resolved.
Calluna is also close to qualifying a new supplier of precision
die-castings in England after the original source, the UK subsidiary of
a US company, pulled out of this activity.
Dr White said demand for the company's 1.8-inch ''callunacard''
disc-drives, used in lap-top and notebook computers, was growing all the
time.
He added: ''Our plant here in Glenrothes has the capability and the
infrastructure and the training in place, and all the ancillary
equipment, to meet the volumes needed for break-even.
''It is really just a question of getting the supplier stream
moving.''
Shares in Calluna, the subject of a #10.1m placing last October,
yesterday lost 2p to 70p.

* TO dare to call your opera company Crystal Clear is putting your
money where your mouth is. After all (though you won't find an opera
company in the land that will admit it), crystal clear is precisely what
opera is not.
To project surtitles or supertitles above the stage during
foreign-language operas is understandable enough. The irony is that,
with all the distortion that goes on by singers in making the beautiful
sound -- vexed vowels, crunched consonants, and hissed sibilants -- it's
often English language operas that cry out for a supertitle or three.
Crystal Clear Opera, the mid-scale English company that is visiting
Edinburgh this week, is a young company -- hence, perhaps, the brashness
of their name. Founded only three years ago, they must be doing
something right (which is a phrase you can't often apply to beleaguered
opera companies these days).
Dedicated to touring, and performing operas in English, Crystal Clear
Opera has been awarded a Special Project Funding grant by the Arts
Council of England in recognition of its achievements. Should be worth a
look.
The company returns to Scotland next month (Bizet's Carmen at His
Majesty's Theatre in Aberdeen, October 17 and 18), and in November
(Madam Butterfly at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling and the Carnegie
Hall in Dunfermline, between the 2nd and 5th of the month).
* Crystal Clear in Scotland this week: tonight: Madam Butterfly,
Edinburgh Festival Theatre, 7.15pm; tomorrow: Don Pasquale, Edinburgh
Festival Theatre, 7.15pm

WITH only two more nights to go, this, ''a work in progress in free
adaptation'', is the seventh and last instalment of Kenneth Davidson's
ambitious dramatisation of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake under the
auspices of Process (Ten 28). Based on Book III of Finnegans Wake, >Mr
Porter> has actor Tam Dean Burns frenetically pacing over a vast
debris-cluttered space in a characterisation which cleverly trembles on
the verge of spoof -- sort of James Joyce meets Mr Bean -- without
tumbling into farce.
The most striking feature of the production is the soundscape created
by Davidson and John L Cobban and the latter's bewitching lighting,
shaking up a boxload of tricks to illuminate the Tramway from every
angle. The opening sequence, with carefully positioned speakers creating
a Boulez-like effect of sounds chasing each other around the theatre, is
extremely arresting and the piece builds to a perfectly paced crescendo,
but the hour in between can be irksome in the extreme.
Davidson is clearly creating a deliberately disquieting effect, from
the horrible slo-mo strobe lighting to the insistent barrages of white
noise to Tam Dean Burns rolling in the rubble beside the two-foot hole
hacked out of the concrete floor and kicking off his kegs -- why is TDB
invariably in the scud at the Tramway? -- but the reactions the piece
induces rarely rumble above a superficial engagement with the text.
I spent most of the performance wondering who would clear the mess up
at the end. Is that a failure on Davidson's part or mine? I was really
trying, honest I was, but could only conclude that he was simply being
trying. Fiesty stuff though.

PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
AMID all the ballyhoo over corporate PEPs there is a real danger that
investors will be disappointed, in that some of these funds --
particularly those with a yield exceeding 8%, will not maintain the
value of the capital invested, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Safety of capital is a priority for the corporate bond PEP launched by
Whittingdale, a fund manager specialising exclusively in fixed interest
investment, handling some #1500m of funds.
The yield on its PEP is 7.25% and will be achieved not by investing in
convertibles but in pure corporate bonds -- the equivalent of corporate
''gilts'' -- issued by companies with a high credit rating.
Bonds will normally be bought at par value, ie at the price at which
they were originally issued and will be redeemed. At present, interest
rate levels on many bonds are standing above par, so that if they were
held until maturity a capital loss is inevitable.
Whittingdale has a good track record in managing the interest rates
cycle and will use the futures market as a kind of insurance against
rate rises.
Minimum investment is #3000, the maximum being the PEP annual limit of
#6000. There is a 3.5% initial charge, of which 0.5% will be waived
until October 20. The annual charge is 1%, to be taken from income.

BRITAIN'S trade gap with the non-EU countries, which accounts for
about half of all UK trade, continues to deteriorate, with the August
visible deficit growing to #996m against July's #872m -- itself revised
upwards from #856m.
The outcome, influenced by oil and erratics, once again wrongfooted
the City, where analysts had been projecting an improvement to around
#725m. It is the biggest gap recorded since December 1992, and mainly
reflects an upsurge in imports from #6016m to #6153m, while exports
almost marked time at #5157m against #5144m, as export growth flattened.
Factors influencing the trading picture include an increase in imports
of semi-manufactured goods, and a sharply weakening position with regard
to North America, with exports little changed and imports sharply
higher.
The oil deficit in the month halved from #154m to #80m, but the
turnaround has been slow in oil, where maintenance work has led to a
fall in the volume of exports in recent months.
There is always a caveat about taking a single month's figures in
isolation, and the August figure has been influenced by an increase in
imports of erratic items defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and
silver.
But the three monthly trend also shows exports falling by 1[1/2]%
while imports rose by 5%. The Central Statistical Office said that
estimates of the trend in value showed imports rising and exports
virtually flat, while the Treasury said the deficit was widening because
of a slowdown in the North American economy, along with a fall in oil
exports.
''The widening of the deficit in recent months partly reflects a fall
in oil exports due to maintenance work in the North Sea, and was also
affected by the slowdown in North America,'' said a Treasury spokesman.
Stripping out oil and erratics left the volume of exports down by 2%
in August and imports by [1/2]%. On the same basis, taking the three
month period, the volume of exports rose by 1% but was easily outpaced
by a 5% increase in imports.
At present, the overall trend in trade appears to be that exports to
EU countries are growing, while non-EU trade is flattening. But export
markets generally seem to be weakening in terms of volume.
James Capel's Adam Cole says that the sharp fall in exports to the US
is likely to be reversed to some extent over the coming months, as US
activity recovers, but more importantly, a significant recovery in
continental European activity will offset weakness elsewhere in the
world.

INDUSTRY worries about the possible extent of the slowdown in economic
growth were compounded by the Confederation of British Industry's
September monthly Industrial Trends Survey, which showed export demand
at its lowest level than at any time this year.
A slowdown -- even flattening in some areas -- in export growth has
also been seen in the UK's trading picture, including the underlying
performance in the the three months to August for non-EU countries,
released yesterday.
Commenting on the CBI findings, Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate
director of economic analysis said: ''The upward momentum in the UK's
manufactured exports now seems to be slackening, due to slower growth in
overseas markets. With domestic demand subdued, the survey confirms that
output growth expectations have moderated when compared with monthly
surveys earlier this year.''
The survey shows that 25% of UK manufacturers said that in volume
terms their export order books were above normal, and 23% below normal,
giving a positive balance of just 2%. This compares with 11% in July and
7% in August, and is the least positive balance in a monthly survey
since September 1994.
Firms also reported a slight weakening in overall demand in September,
with 22% of them saying that in volume terms their order books were
above normal, with 23% reporting below normal -- a negative balance of
1%. This compares with a positive 2% last month, and negative balance of
2% in July. Order books have now been regarded as above normal for nine
of the last 12 months.
On prices, the findings may be encouraging so far as the factory gate
price inflation outlook is concerned, but also raises concern about the
pace of recovery.
More firms still expect to increase domestic prices over the next four
months than to reduce them, although this month's balance of 7% is 6%
lower than in August, and the expected rate of price rise is at the
lowest level recorded since May 1994.
Nearly seven out of 10 companies expect that prices will remain
unchanged over the next four months. This is a reflection of tough
competitive conditions at home and in overseas markets.
So far as output expectations are concerned, these hardly changed in
September, although firms continue to expect marked growth over the
coming four months. September's positive balance of 20% of firms is 1%
below last month's.
Over the past month, firms have seen a build-up in their stocks of
finished products, but next month's CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends
survey should give a clearer indication of its impact on the future pace
of the manufacturing recovery.

MANAGEMENT changes are all the rage at Laura Ashley, but there seems
to have been very little impact on the bottom line. Once again the chief
executive's vision is to establish a retail culture which will fulfill
the brand's potential and deliver value to shareholders.
We heard similar words from the previous chief executive -- the
charismatic Jim Maxmin -- but he was ousted before the fruits of his
actions were reaped. Given consumers' continued reluctance to spend
their money, and the competitive nature of UK retailing, there is no
room for also-rans such as Laura Ashley.
The Laura Ashley brand is well known throughout the world -- a
franchise which many other retailers would die for. In addition, its
customers have remained remarkably loyal. However, the company has
consistently failed to make the most of its franchise despite several
restructuring programmes.
It is not surprising that there are rumours of predators circling over
the company. Ms Iverson, the new chief executive, has an excellent track
record from her previous work, which includes turning round Mothercare,
but whether or not she will be given the headroom fully to instigate her
revival plans at Laura Ashley remains to be seen.
In the meantime, shareholders can be forgiven for wishing they had put
their money into some of the more successful retail recovery stories
such as Next and Storehouse.

THEY closed Our Lady and Saint Francis a good few years ago; the men
did. The priests. Sister Felicity had been headmistress of all she saw
in the Charlotte Street school, a school for Catholic girls, drawn from
all over Glasgow where bright and clever girls, mostly working class,
were drawn. Every year Charlotte Street girls were close to the top in
the Glasgow University bursaries. So they closed it; the men did. The
priests of course were avid. They traded off the closure of Our Lady and
Saint Francis and let it amalgamate with Saint Mungo's boys school, an
unlikely and fruitless combination, but allowed the posh and
middle-class all-girls Notre Dame School in the West End to continue. In
the meantime Catholic priests had no objection to the continued
existence of fee-paying Saint Aloysius in Garnethill, or Fernhill on the
South Side of Glasgow. They didn't close them, but they closed Charlotte
Street.
And now we are back at school closures. I was there a decade ago when
everybody knew we had to close down these institutions, or some of them
at least. I was, then, the teacher representative on Strathclyde
Regional Council education committee. There were two teacher
representatives. I was one. The other was a woman called Kathy Finn.
I was a maverick, admittedly from the old hard left. Kathy was a new
Labour member whose background was militant Trotskyist. The Labour Party
of that day found Kathy's apostate Infantile Disorder, to use Lenin's
description, and newly-found Labour orthodoxy more congenial than my
exotic eccentricity. But later they found my mercurial politics rather
useful, for I was in favour of school closure, and I still am. And here
we are again with school closures.
For the closure scenario is back. Reports vary as to the savings which
could be found if we closed schools which are no longer viable,
financially or scholastically. The Herald suggests it could be #25m.
Other reports incline to #40m. Believe me, it could be a lot more than
that, and with any kind of sense it should.
The cost of heating and lighting and staffing schools which have
capacities for 2000 pupils and only 60 poor wee boys and girls in them
is both high and absurd. As absurd is the parental and teacher
resistance to school closures. The moment the question of a school
closure in a local area comes up the teachers, parents, and certainly
local politicians, start telling you how bloody wonderful the toilet
which children were forced into actually was. I have heard, been written
to copiously, about how splendid these sump schools, with their
appalling academic records, were: Christ you'd have thought they were
bloody Eton.
But what we should of course be doing is closing all the schools,
every one of them, and shoving children into a decent education. If
Frank O'Connor, the great Irish writer, could manage to write the most
mellifluous prose of any short piece chap in the British islands in the
twentieth century, and him leaving school at the age of 11, or H L
Mencken, or William Porter Sydney, which is to say, O Henry, or, dear
heaven's, Einstein himself, if they could manage without the exertions
demanded by the dull doyens of dame schools, then I am bloody sure we
all could.
Close the schools and release the teachers from the misery of their
duties. The dominies are all looking for early retirement anyway. Give
the buggers it. Retire them as early as we can, perhaps just before they
start a pedagogical career. Send the children away up chimneys and to
boot camps. It'll do them good. Or better anyway.
Better, a lot better, than schools full of nonsense about projects and
coloured drawings on the wall just to impress illiterate councillors.
Schools which are almost empty and emptier of intellect. I have seen
schools go from amphitheatres of sadism but with a point to them, to
asylums of small groups of indulged children and adults with none at all
except a place to go for the weans and an income for the so-called
grown-ups.
I read our blatt's pieces yesterday about the proposed school
closures. One of the articles had the sort of graph educated people of
my generation don't quite understand. Understand this: save the forty
millions, sort out the schools, put some bloody sense into, at least,
the budget for schools if you can't manage the curriculum. Sack
damn-near everybody in senior and middle management who haven't stuck
their slimy bodies in front of a class in the past 10 years and do this:
open up Our Lady and Saint Francis and the other schools which once had
excellence and were, oddly and marvellously, over-subscribed because
every sensible parent wanted their children there, in that school. The
schools that should be opening up.

UNLIKE previous pick-ups out of recession, or from very low rates of
expansion, the economic recovery in the UK has not been fuelled this
time by rising domestic demand but on the back of export growth.
On both the evidence of trade figures in recent months and now the
CBI's Monthly Industrial Trends Survey for September, this export growth
looks to be faltering.
While it is perhaps too soon to draw any hard and fast conclusions on
this, since it is largely a reflection of slower growth worldwide, which
may be reversed, there are undoubtedly worrying features. If, after two
years in which the UK's manufacturing growth and the economic recovery
have been driven by exports, what is there to take up the slack if the
lower trend in exports continues?
The Chancellor, in his Tuesday speech, said confidently that the
slowdown in the economy was simply a change in the pace of growth to a
more sustainable rate, and not a cause for concern, as the fundamentals
were very strong.
However, if the slowdown in exports proves to be more deep rooted,
there is no sign that the consumer has yet recovered that elusive so
called feelgood factor sufficiently, if at all, to start spending and
rev up the economic motor afresh.
The CBI's new director-general Adair Turner warned this week that
there was a greater risk of further slowdown in the UK economy than of
higher inflation, and that in the current environment it would be
perhaps more appropriate if the next move in interest rates was down
rather than up.
While interest rates will probably be kept on hold as the evidence
accumulates one way or the other, a reduction is beginning to look much
more likely if the authorities think it is sustainable.

BEER is not yet rationed in Britain. So to see a queue outside a
Glasgow pub on a Friday night means there must be an explanation other
than the simple one of demand exceeding supply.
You're thirsty. You want a beer. So you walk into a pub. Couldn't be
simpler. But of course it isn't that simple.
If you are as old as me you remember the queues outside The Rock in
Glasgow's West End on a Friday night in the seventies. No shortage of
beer then either. The attraction then, quite simply, was women. Forget
all the theories about how there is only one person in the world who is
ideally suited to you. In The Rock it was simply a question of asking
someone if they would like a drink. Well it worked for two friends of
mine in The Rock, and they are still happily married to the women they
met.
But women have grown a tad more adventurous since then. They are quite
happy to drink anywhere that suits them, so queueing outside a pub
merely to meet a woman seems a thing of the past.
Only it isn't in St Vincent Street, Glasgow. The queue there last
Friday was outside an Irish pub. I'm sure it had a Gaelic name, but all
the signs said Irish Pub. It hasn't always been an Irish pub of course,
but with the transformation of slapping up a lot of posters of Ireland,
and installing a fiddler in the corner, the owners have astutely
realised that Glaswegians are willing to put their thirst on hold while
they stand outside until the half-dozen doormen judge there is room for
them to go inside.
Why an Irish pub? Well, as Jinty McGinty's, the first Irish pub in the
West End of Glasgow has proved, people warm to the Irish theme, with its
flavour of warm hospitality, a good crack, and a bit of entertainment.
This, of course, coming from the country with more terrorist outrages
than anywhere else in Europe until Yugoslavia fell apart. Now that
really is a triumph for marketing.
But it's not only in Glasgow of course. All across Europe Irish pubs
are springing up quicker than a barman can pour a pint of Guinness.
I felt like an explorer when I crunched through the snow across the
600-year-old town square of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, two years
ago. Only the Irish were there before me. Two Irish pubs were already
installed in the town before the locals could even pronounce capitalism.
It's the same in Germany, Italy, and Spain. Irish pubs, with their air
of warmth and geniality, are stowed out with young drinkers across
Europe.
So if ethnic drinking is the growing market, where are the Scots pubs?
Ah, now this is where a few folk feel a bit uncomfortable. Glasgow has
spent the past decade extolling itself as a modern European city. Bars
sprang up as altars to designer beers, chrome furnishings and the
seriously trendy. The whole idea was to make bars appear as if they
could be anywhere in the world and unrecognisable as Scottish. Now the
Irish have come along and spoiled it all by pointing out that people
actually want a little bit of ethnicity.
But if you wanted Scots pubs, wouldn't they all turn out like ghastly
museums dedicated to Harry Lauder, with Scottie dogs and shortbread
tins? Or would they be really Scottish and have two disinterested
barmaids standing in one corner discussing their love lives while people
stood unserved frantically trying to attract their attention?
Scottish &amp; Newcastle has helped set up a few Scots pubs in Italy. They
have names like the Isle of Skye, the St Andrews Golf Club, and The
Scotsman. All are decked out with Scottish memorabilia -- but in a
tasteful way they assure me -- ''Red Beer'' as the Italians for some
reason call pints of heavy, and a sizable gantry of malts. Oh, and they
had to send over some Scots to help explain the concept.
The Italians, it seems, had to be coaxed into standing at the bar,
ordering a pint, and drinking it there. Otherwise they would have sat at
a table and waited to be served. Can you imagine how long that would
have taken in a pub here? So if you see a skeleton covered in cobwebs in
the corner of your local, call the Italian Embassy, he's probably one of
theirs.
So why are the Italians interested in Scots pubs? ''Scotland has a
very positive image overseas compared with England,'' says S&amp;N's
commercial manager (Europe) Jenny Bainbridge. ''The image is one of
warmth and friendliness.''
The company will slowly expand into other European countries because
the reception has been so good.
But why do we have to wait for S&amp;N? The Scottish Tourist Board spends
thousands of pounds abroad on advertising campaigns which have a
variable success rate.
Shouldn't Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who wants to increase
the tourist industry, better employ the tourist board by telling them to
spend the money on opening Scots pubs across the Continent instead?
Everyone would learn how warm and friendly Scotland is and would want to
visit it for themselves, and at the same time the tourist board would
actually make a profit.
Surely a government agency making money instead of spending it would
appeal to a right-winger like Michael Forsyth. After all, the Government
quite happily owned its own pubs in the Carlisle area during the war.
And it would be a success I'm sure. After all, for all his faults,
no-one has actually suggested that Michael Forsyth is incapable of
organising a piss- up in a brewery.

FUND management group Aberdeen Trust yesterday announced plans to
dispose of its accountancy and taxation business.
It has just sold one of its six accountancy offices, in Winchester, to
an individual for a cash consideration of up to #110,000.
The Winchester operation is one of the smaller of the six branch
offices, which are spread throughout England.
However, with negotiations concerning the sale of the five remaining
offices ongoing, finance director Bill Rattray would not be drawn on how
much Abtrust hoped to realise from the disposals.
He said the offices, which deal with personal and corporate taxation,
accountancy and audit work, had not been particularly profitable during
the last couple of years.
The accountancy and taxation business is a relatively small part of
Abtrust, which has funds under management of #2700m.

TECHNOLOGY SURVEY
A MAJORITY of Britons are optimistic about their prospects in the age
of information technology (IT) but there is a wide gap between those who
are IT-literate and those who are not -- largely determined by
employment status, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Potentially worrying for the future is that as many as one in five of
the under 25s and a third of 25-44 year olds have received no IT
training at all.
These are some of the findings of a survey conducted by MORI on behalf
of Motorola entitled ''Prepared for the Future? The British and
Technology''.
The survey attempted to find how people in Britain have adapted so far
to the impact of new technologies, both at home and within the
workplace.
Among the survey's findings was an indication that people in Britain
are ready to start using on-line services. Around 70% of people are
comfortable with on-line telephone directory enquiries, with 52% feeling
the same way about using a computer for home banking.
Perhaps not surprisingly, there was a drop-off in levels of training,
equipment usage and familiarity with IT from the age of 45. Contrary to
initial expectations, evidence from the survey suggests that IT is
reinforcing the divides in British society rather than breaking them
down.
There does not appear to be any gender difference in terms of
willingness to embrace new technology. However, IT training was less
prevalent amongst part-time workers, of whom the vast majority are
female.
Familiarity with and positive attitudes towards IT were noticeably
higher in those groups that enjoyed economically advantaged status
before the IT revolution. These include men, southerners, younger age
groups, the employed, higher socio-economic groups and the better
educated.
More than half of senior executives have received in-house IT
training, compared to 12% in the general population.
Contrary to popular perceptions, the most likely user of a computer
game is a senior British executive.
On balance, information technology is seen as a catalyst for a more
prosperous and rewarding future for us all.

IN THE supermarket, road rage becomes aisle rage. On the miniature
motorways of Safeway and Tesco the acts of aggression are furtive: the
impatient shopper, blocked in by trolleys, nips the heels of a dithering
driver and affects dismay: ''Oops, sorry! Just trying to get through
here.''
The old ladies have come up with a new trick. Self-preservation is the
name of their game and they play it ruthlessly. ''Hand Baskets Only,''
says the sign by the fast check-out till; out of the pensioner's trolley
come two wire baskets packed with purchases, while behind the wily
wrinkly forms a queue of bona fide trolley-drivers, tightening their
lips on the rhetorical impulse to granny-bash.
Shop rage. Sometimes it's the customer who offends, sometimes it's the
assistant, and sometimes both conspire to bring each other to the edge
of confrontation. In the dry cleaner's the other day I witnessed a
low-key exchange -- between charmless young woman and deadpan
middle-aged one -- which reduced the pair of them to the human
equivalent of raised fur.
The young woman was submitting a raincoat. ''Do you want it
reproofed?'' asked the assistant.
''What does reproofed mean?'' asked the customer; a reasonable
question, but demanded unsmilingly, with just a hint of challenge, as if
sharp practice were suspected. The assistant took her cue from the
customer's manner and was determined to give the least helpful
explanation. ''Do you want it reproofed? Is this coat waterproof, and do
you want it reproofed?'' Stand-off. Feeling Pollyanna-ish (not
necessarily my prevailing mood when shopping) I was tempted to mediate
and break the deadlock, but they completed their transaction with the
technology of reproofing still unelucidated and parted grumpily.
Smugly, almost cynically, I beamed at the shop assistant, remarked on
the weather and just like that, easy-peasy, received in return a
cautious smile and some further analysis of the temperature and air
quality.
If I were Minister of Education and Employment, which means if I were
Gillian Shephard, I would instruct my civil servants and their
counterparts at the Scottish Office to build into the school curriculum
a charm offensive. The Minister herself, as Anne Simpson's interview on
Monday gracefully affirmed, is blessed with natural charm. Others must
learn to acquire it or, if they will never charm the birds off the
trees, learn to acquire the next best thing: courtesy, preferably
leavened with the kind of vitality which animates the human face and
saves it from the dangerous ambiguity of the blank expression.
You can go a long way without qualifications with a good personality.
Shops can't choose their customers, but they can choose their staff.
There's a leisurewear store on Edinburgh's Princes Street which, when I
first entered it with my daughter, made me feel old, frail, and nervous;
a ''young person's'' shop, all jeans and jogging bottoms and wee Marie
Lawrie from Dennistoun singing Re-Lite Ma Fy-yar with Take That.
You know the kind of place: an alien environment for anyone over the
age of 18 (dammit, I can STILL wear denim) where I expected the youthful
assistants to ignore me while they compared tattoos or, at best, to
redirect me to Marks and Spencer's without noticing that I was
legitimately accompanied by Mark Owen's greatest fan.
In fact, they were terrific: bright-faced, welcoming, relaxed and
efficient among the noise and crush, treating me and the 11-year-old to
the same bouncy enthusiasm. Each and every one has maintained this
upbeat level of helpfulness on return visits, making me think that
Jeanster, like Gap, must select and train their staff with care, and
that if academic life ever fails my daughter (or she it) she could make
a happy career in retailing with such an outfit.
Elsewhere, I long to rouse the slack-jawed youth and the dull-eyed
girl with tips on attitude, and introduce them to the Jeanster ethos,
although sometimes I wonder which comes first: do shops get the
assistants they deserve, or do some assistants find the merchandise they
sell so tacky and trivial that it depresses their spirits?
I've never been much impressed by the commitment shown by those who
serve in Pickwicks, the greetings card and so-called novelties outlet,
but can you blame them? If I spent my working days surrounded by Forever
Friends stationery, latex trolls, dancing sunflowers, and cream-filled
chocolate willies I would do my best to prevent the customers buying
anything, too. Besides, the Pickwicks range of cute gismos,
''humourous'' birthday cards and naughty novelties, increasingly brings
out the Mary Whitehouse in me.
I stay out of the place as much as possible, but on Monday I was
forced to suspend my boycott of the local branch. A birthday loomed,
Edinburgh was en vacance, I was short of time, and Pickwicks, the
emporium of the primary-school consumer, clearing house of pre-teen
pocket money, purveyors of teddy bear fridge magnets, fluorescent
dolphin stickers, and folkweave friendship bracelets, was the only
neighbourhood card shop open.
It greeted me with a question: ''How does your man measure up in the
Dingly-Dangly Department?''
None of your business. This birthday greeting was among the more
innocent; others belonged on the shelves of porn shops ('How do you
define INDECENT? If it's BIG, HARD, and UP far enough it's IN-DECENT'')
while the latest range of novelties included Penis Pasta, After-Dinner
Nipples, the Instant Kinky Whip Kit (#6.99), and the Exotic Dance Apron
-- Inflatable Pinny with TASSLES for that extra SWING!
The last time I saw sex aids so triumphantly displayed -- even joke
sex aids like these lamentably unwitty products -- I was standing in the
Place Blanche in Paris; where at least they have the good taste and good
sense to keep them away from Forever Friends key rings, Pooh Bear
organisers, and primary-school pocket money.

WHEN Ken Campbell makes a quip about an obscure church where they
combine Russian roulette with the Eucharist, you're inclined to think of
the incongruous humour of Reeves and Mortimer. The difference with
Campbell, though, is the suspicion it might be true.
This self-described bald-headed, witty geezer with a bee in his bonnet
about what he calls ''the storm-troopers of cliche'', lives in a world
that is both familiar and strange.
In the past his solo shows have explored the unlikely coincidences
that have beset his life. This one is about the possibility of
controlling those coincidences -- ''affirmation'' is the technical term
-- and making them work for you. It's also about possession and
reincarnation, and gets a lot of mileage from the Cathar heretics, who
also cropped up in his last show about quantum mechanics, and a group
that believes God is evil, Jesus missed the crucifixion, and that we
should all be in it for a laugh.
If I add that Campbell's tale also takes us to Newfoundland and the
Pyrenees, through the bowels of the National Theatre, and past the
quirks of Orthodox Jews, while adding emotional weight to the death of
his 18-year-old performing dog, you'll get a sense of the show's
continual bombardment of ideas.
Loquacious as ever, perhaps Campbell pushes the information overload
too far, the second half, especially, weighing heavy with complex
philosophy between the gags. But all praise to this chummy raconteur for
shaking us from our dull perceptions.

BRITAIN'S leading banana importer, Geest, yesterday saw its half-year
profits turn bad as it unveiled a fall to #4m before tax from #17.9m in
the corresponding period last year.
Geest handles half the bananas eaten in Britain and yesterday denied
reports that it was quitting the business to concentrate on convenience
foods.
Profits fell in the six months to July 1 as Geest suffered #5m worth
of exceptional costs associated with disposal of fruit wholesale
businesses.
The interim dividend is pegged at 3.7p on earnings per share down to
9.1p from 14.9p.
Geest also warned that its suppliers in the West Indies had been hit
by hurricanes and storms.
Dominica had been badly affected by hurricane Luis and St Lucia had
lost an estimated 5% of its crop as a result of tropical storm Iris at
the end of August. Dominica accounts for about 12% of the bananas
shipped by Geest.
After a difficult start to the second half, banana prices had started
to firm in September, said the group, which is based at Spalding in
Lincolnshire.

CONTINUING its defence against Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's (RPR) hostile
#1700m bid, pharmaceutical group Fisons yesterday spelt out what it sees
as the value in the company. It points to advance delivery device
technology and development capability, its leading products, and strong
global sales and marketing infrastructure.
Fisons' global sales network has operations in 27 countries,
distributors in many other countries and a total respiratory sales force
of over 1300. As well as strong brand names, the company says it has a
reputation for medical expertise and a progressive programme of product
launches, comprising devices and products developed in-house and
products acquired and licensed in. In Japan, Fisons is the ''premier
foreign company in the inhaled respiratory and hayfever markets''.
Stuart Wallis, chief executive, comments, ''It is a measure of Fisons'
strength in sales and marketing that RPR, in order to market its
resiratory products in Europe effectively, chose to form a joint venture
with Fisons in 1994. RPR well understands the potential value to it of
our respiratory sales and marketing network.''

ON the randan is a wonderfully evocative phrase, much beloved of
Scottish people. When the BBC Gaelic department announced that it had
made a series of four comedy programmes with the title Randan, we
assumed the phrase had its origin somewhere in the Celtic twilight.
But randan does not feature in the Gaelic dictionaries. Any connection
may be that the Gaels are expert at going on the randan. We associate
the randan with going out for more than a few drinks and perhaps missing
your tea.
The dictionaries have it as riotous or disorderly behaviour. A randan
is also described as a type of horse-drawn carriage, course wheat flour,
or a boat rowed by three people, one of whom has two oars. We can safely
rule out these from our deliberations.
All of the dictionary references describe the origin of randan as
obscure. The BBC is pretty specific, characterising its Gaelic comedy
programme as ''fast-paced, earthy, and subversive''.
We have seen excerpts but cannot comment on the jokes. There was a
sketch in which we understood the words ''agus Park Bar, agus Snaffle
Bit, agus boiler suit, and agus Marks and Sparks''.
Randan is a bit naughty. It has a wicked take-off of one Rhoda
Macleod, head of Gaelic affairs at Scottish TV. And an even more wicked
impersonation of a mythical lady columnist and agony aunt called ''Jean
Gurnie, head harridan'' of a tabloid newspaper called the Daily Scunner,
played by a nice young chap in ladies' clothes.
The Diary's chum, Joan Burnie of the Daily Record, may wish to talk to
her lawyer about this.
Bonnie Prince Charlie, who is noo awa, cannot have recourse to the
courts for the programme's depiction of him as a total nancy boy.
Lesson learned
WITH great topicality and an eye for a quick buck, Malcolm McPherson
of Glasgow insurance brokers Orr Kerr Dykes has been writing to clients
this week on the subject of planning for school fees.
He wrote as part of his spiel: ''The cost of private education has
never been greater, particularly if any of your children decide to stay
on at school until their early thirties (maybe this only happens in
Bearsden).''
Ale and farty
ENTIRELY on your behalf we had a look in at the Glasgow Ale Festival
which runs until Saturday at the Arches in Midland Street. We tasted the
bizarrely named beers such as Whistlebelly Vengeance, Son of a Bitch,
Old Slug, and Old Horsewhip -- some of which live up to their names.
We can confirm that King Billy ale does indeed have undertones of
bitter orange. Gothic stout from Staffordshire, made by a beekeeper,
lives up to its claim that it has ''lurking undertones of honey''.
Ayrshire Gold, a cask lager made in the tiny hamlet of Lugton, is full
of flavour and a kind of unusual experience to us chaps used to a bit of
fizz in our amber liquid.
And it's not just drink. There is the opportunity to picnic upon
brilliant German sausages, complete with mustard or broon sauce. A stall
run by Ashby's, an Edinburgh deli, offers ripe cheeses, a spicy bean
dish, and a Scottish wild garlic and brandy pate.
The phrase ''I wouldn't like to clean out his cage'' springs to mind.
Pulling strings
THERE is much good reading in Scotland's local newspapers. Like an
article by Sharon Black of the Irvine Times on a visit to a
reflexologist. Ms Black gives a detailed and informative report on this
form of alternative medicine which claims to reach various parts of the
body through foot massage.
In fact, she confirms this: ''Just as Brendan (the reflexologist)
reaches up one side of my foot I feel what seems like a tiny tweak in my
right ovary -- a bit like the feeling some women get as their egg is
released during their menstrual cycle.
''True enough, Brendan informs me he is working on the area which
relates to my reproductive system. The childhood ditty, 'The wrist
bone's connected to the arm bone' springs to mind as I visualise a
puppet string linking my instep with my reproductive system! I am
amazed.'' So are we, so are we.
Urban crofters
THE post-industrialisation of Scotland makes a great leap forward
today with the official opening of a crofting development in West
Lothian.
We have visions of sheep grazing on coal bings and Bathgate folk out
cutting peat but it probably won't be like that at all. The crofting
development at West Harwood -- which is opened today by the Scottish
Agriculture Minister, the Earl of Lindsay -- is a private venture by a
company called New Lives, New Enterprises.
If you think the name is kinda New Age, you will not be surprised to
hear that one of the industries on the 220-acre site is the manufacture
of horse blankets, a new trade to those parts. Another pursuit, the
rearing of game birds, may be more familiar to the denizens of West
Lothian.
Unfair crack
WE read in the minutes of Kyle and Carrick council that the Whip Men
Society of Ayr has been disbanded. We put our best team of investigative
reporters to check out this kinky-sounding group but could only find out
that the whip men were nice people who liked horses, did charitable
works, but have run out of funds.

ROBERT W Worcester, Chairman of MORI, says that opinion polls and
voting patterns in Scotland over the last two decades have shown a vast
majority of Scots have wanted a tax-raising assembly (September 20).
The last two decades include March 1979 when in a full-scale opinion
poll carried out over the entire Scottish electorate (and before
tax-raising powers were an issue) a combined ''vast majority'' of Scots
either voted No to a Scottish Assembly or did not bother to vote at all.
As far as voting patterns are concerned, over the last two decades the
vote for the only party capable of delivering a Scottish assembly had
been in steady decline in Scotland -- from 46.5% of the Scottish vote in
1970 to 39% of the vote in 1992.
In fact, in the last General Election the Labour vote in Scotland fell
by a significant 3.4% while the vote for the pro-devolution Liberal
Democrats fell by no less than 6.3%.
The arrogance of opinion pollsters in setting aside General Election
results in favour of surveys carried out over minuscule fractions of the
Scottish electorate, and usually over only 40 or so selected
constituencies out of a total 72, is exactly what caused the Scottish
media to end up asking ''Why did everyone get it so wrong?'' after the
last General Election.
As for ''54% of people in England'' (more correctly 54% of whatever
tiny sample was interviewed) thinking this or that, English lack of
understanding of Scotland's politics is legendary.
A few weeks ago some very nice and otherwise well-informed English
visitors remarked to me that it must be very frustrating to be a
Scottish Conservative ''when everyone up here votes Labour''.
When I pointed out that in the last General Election only 39% of
Scottish voters had voted Labour and, notwithstanding anything they had
read or heard, the Conservative Party was the second most popular party
with voters at Scottish ballot boxes and had been for the past 40 years,
they were at first incredulous and later became very thoughtful.
When I was myself involved in running an independent market-research
unit, what we offered our clients was complete clinical objectivity.
From the tenor of Mr Worcester's letter, it seemed that essential
objectivity was somewhat lacking.

HAVING followed the daily awareness-raising pieces on the public
perception of home rule, I wonder whether the Labour Party could state
how much the salary would be of Scottish parliamentary members.
No self-respecting politician in any party or none will choose to
stand for election if it is to be paid for with the usual regional and
district ''payments for attendance''. If an assembly is to have any
democratic weight it must be recognised as an arm of serious Government
and not a replacement for the dying regional set-up.
Without fudging from the Constitutional Convention engineers, can they
reveal for those who would serve Scotland at the presently-proposed
highest level whether or not they should consider giving up their
daytime jobs?

I WAS pleased to read The Herald Essay comparing Scott's novels with
those of Kelman, McIlvanney, and others who have as their main
characters workers of limited vocabulary consisting in the main of
four-letter words (September 16).
I have often wondered why there never seems to be a main character,
say, an engineer, chemist, banker, lawyer, musician, businessman, or
blue-collar worker who manages to express himself without so much bad
language. It's so boring.
Perhaps some of the fault lies with our library facilities. I have
just waited three weeks for a copy of Quentin Durward from Strathkelvin
Libraries. I have been informed that they do keep a large selection in
their reserve stock!
I have made the point that the Waverley Novels should be on display on
their shelves as an example of good writing to all aspiring novelists.

THREE cheers for David Hall's Essay (Sepember 16). It is way past time
the reverse snobbery of McIlvanney and Kelman and their ilk was revealed
for what it is -- the last refuge of class-ridden minds.
The Essay is a fine answer to those blinkered invididuals who want to
bring the Scots dialect to the forefront of teaching in schools. There
are already too many of our children emerging from school illiterate,
ill-spoken, and unable to communicate properly.
We can learn about Burns, be proud of being Scots without sinking into
the oblivion of a language which is not understood outside the environs
of Glasgow, or Aberdeen or Dundee. Each of these cities has a different
dialect but none of them will enable a youngster to communicate in
French, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, or Japanese. At least English
is understood throughout the world, but apart from Auld Lang Syne, Scots
language needs translation.
Wake up, Scotland! We are entering the second millennium, not stepping
back into the seventeenth century.

I ENJOYED William Hunter's informative article on the phrase, Doon the
watter, in which he begins by admitting to statements that fell short of
gross exactness (September 16). Unfortunately he then goes on to say,
''Dictionaries will have nothing to do with it''. Not so. The delightful
Concise Scots Dictionary (Aberdeen University Press, now Chambers) has
this: ''Doon the watter down the river, specif of pleasure trips or
resorts on the Clyde (late nineteenth century)''.
I don't think the phrase is particularly patronising. It
affectionately encapsulates a period of West of Scotland social history.
On the other hand, I remember a teacher in Dunoon telling us about a
Glasgow child he had overheard  on a Clyde steamer. The child espied the
seagulls and cried: ''Haw, maw! Look at the doo's on the watter!''
Now that is, perhaps, a patronising story.

I dare say Catherine Traynor (Bland, inarticulate breed of
Sloppyspeak, September 15) would have had Elvis Presley shaken up,
though I doubt if lack of Latin and Greek has much to do with our
ignoring irregular verbs.
Mark Twain wrote in Life on Mississippi, ''The unpolished
(Southerners) often use 'went' for 'gone' . . . 'He hadn't ought to have
went'.'' Johnson said of Shakespeare that he had ''small Latin, and less
Greek''.
Nor is it enough to know your clunis from your cubitum. Johnson said
of Garrick: ''He has not Latin enough. He finds out the Latin by the
meaning, rather than the meaning by the Latin.''

ONCE more I note pleas from charities that something should be done
about the income drop from donors due to the National Lottery. Experts
say that it is too early to assess this but it has been with us long
enough to find that what was a forecast from the charities is now
becoming a fact.
I too feel that this is inevitable but that the methods adopted to
raise money have become outdated. While many still respond to the
numerous charity mailshots appearing with monotonous regularity, others
that offer huge cash prizes, for example from mail order companies, are
bound to siphon off cash.
Joe Public nowadays looks for the possibility of acquiring a new car,
a holiday abroad, thousands of pounds every year for life, etc, etc, and
will choose that more often than a request for a cash donation, a
cheque, a bond, or whatever. The scratch card and the lottery ticket may
provide these for the price of a pound or two.
I donate regularly to several charities, but in addition fall for the
free competitions ''if you buy our product'' or ''Take the next six
months issue of XXXX magazine . . . '', etc.
Some imagination on the part of the many worthy charities might to
some extent stem the flow of people ceasing to contribute.
Although the constitution applying to the lottery may not at the
moment permit allocating a share to charities suffering losses, surely
after a certain time any set of rules needs revision.
These are issues that could not be foreseen at the outset, for
instance the incredible amount of money accumulating to one winner
amounting to millions of pounds. If a registered charity could prove the
amount lost in any year, could this not be made up to it?

ANY employer which does not take the training of its staff seriously
-- whether in the public or private sector -- is probably ill-prepared
to meet the challenges of an increasingly demanding and constantly
changing work environment.
Tom Shields's Diary piece (September 15) which accuses the Scottish
Arts Council of wasting taxpayers' money on management training is not
only inaccurate but demonstrates just how out of touch Tom Shields is.
First the facts. The SAC did not spend #1400 a head sending its
management team on the Management Centre's course for chief executives.
If Tom Shields had read the leaflet properly he would have seen that
this is a new course and the first programme takes place in November.
Two years ago the SAC invested in a Management Centre training
programme for all its staff at a cost of #187 per head. The cost was met
from our overheads budget which, at just over 8% of total budget, is
proportionately the lowest among the other arts funding bodies in the
UK.
The Scottish Arts Council is committed to training its staff. In a
recent survey of the artists, arts organisations, and other bodies with
whom we have regular contact, the vast majority of respondents
considered our staff to be professional, well-informed, helpful, and
supportive of their work.
These are the professional standards which are expected of us and
training is one means of ensuring that we continue to measure up.
Thankfully, many of the arts organisations we fund also value management
training and make good use both of the courses available to them and of
the training grants the SAC provides.

THE boot-camp proposals identified by Home Secretary Michael Howard
will raise screams of ecstasy from the representatives of the Tory Party
Conference -- that is predictable and follows the law-and-order line
presented by the Conservatives over many years.
What is more interesting is to read (September 19) that the Scottish
Police Federation are supportive of the idea.
From my own long experience of the Scottish prison system I am quite
clear in my view that the practice of short sharp shock techniques
simply has no good effect on the majority of young offenders. The
evidence from within Scotland is living proof that this method of
operation was counter-productive.
The revenge motive is recognisable from right-wing Tories. The
Scottish Police Federation should know better although it is obvious
that certain members of our police forces are on a par with Howard's
thinking.
The major criticism should be aimed at the Prison Service who, with
few exceptions, have failed properly to confront offenders with their
techniques. One of the exceptions was the Special Unit at Barlinnie
which produced rehabilitative results previously unheard of. The
Scottish Office closed it.!
Michael Howard and his cohorts are stupidly wrong with this proposal.
The Scottish Police Federation should be given the same label unless the
more responsible members of the organisation react to the suggestion
from their leaders.

MAY I make the following points in connection with the article, Anger
at pay rises of up to #10,000 (September 21)?
The increases for the 39 chief officers are not over three years. A
pay review should have been undertaken three years ago in line with
national conditions of service. Given the council's particular finances
at the time the review was delayed.
The acting director of social work's salary does not jump from #49,000
to #59,000. Mr Smith's salary will be increased as from October 1, 1995,
to #49,000. There is still a differential between my salary and other
directors' of 15%.
These overdue increases in salary, which bring Western Isles Islands
Council into line with the rest of the country, have been entirely
funded by efficiency savings as a result of internal restructuring,
including early retirements and merging of departments.
I believe the council's communications officer has already been in
touch with you about a disturbing number of inaccuracies in press
reports about the Western Isles. I would repeat that we are always
happy, at any time, to confirm or otherwise the facts of any story.

AS Alan Dunlop and Claire Henry ably endorse in both letters and
comparative articles on Bilbao and Glasgow, the essential ingredient for
regeneration in both cities must be the mix of public and private
investment.
Indeed, Professor John Riddell's admirable history of the River Clyde
demonstrates that this was exactly how Glasgow achieved ''Second City of
the Empire'' status in the last century.
Engineering, infrastructure, and architectural achievement resulted
from necessity. The city can engineer this excellence again.
Sadly, the New Glasgow Society predictably continues in its ''King's
new clothes'' tradition with derisory comments on anything remotely
forward-looking (September 19). Private equals bad, therefore public
must be good. Always either-or rather than both-and.
Despite the second-hand ideology proposed, any development or
regeneration of the city in the future will, as in previous eras, have
been stimulated by private investment. Admirably and in some cases
perversely supported by public finance initiatives from the city's
council and development agency.
The city itself is dynamic, not suspended in aspic. This continually
shifting focus requires any strategic planning initiative to react to
this reality, not hypotheses. Solving problems specifically caused by
solutions to earlier problems. We do not have a clean slate.
It is folly and historically unprecedented to suggest that the massive
regeneration required will happen by any other mechanism. Ignoring this
is signally the reason behind the ills that beset the city.

I READ in Tom Shields's Diary that the Scottish Arts Council staff
have just something in the region of #10,000 on so called staff
training. What a waste of public money.
It's about time Seona Reid and her staff were made to answer to the
public.
Why should all this money be spent on this rubbish, when performing
groups such as the Scottish Bach Consort and the Pumpherston Festival
cannot get a grant to fund anything? Is it because they are constantly
performing to no less than full houses, or is it because they are not
performing contemporary works like the Paragon Ensemble does with a
handful in the audience?
It seems under the SAC remit that small groups with a very small
audience are funded to whatever it takes to keep them on the road.
We read that audience figures to concerts are falling. Not surprising
when members of the public rarely hear what they want to hear. What has
happened to the classical music repertoire?

Tom Hanks finds there is life after Forrest Gump, as WILLIAM RUSSELL
explains.
HE is an ''astronut''. He knows he will be forever Forrest Gump and
that when he dies his obituaries on television will use clips of him
sitting on that bench, but it is space travel that really grabs him. Has
done since he was a lad. He does not think he should win a third
consecutive Oscar for his role in the space epic Apollo 13, although he
is well aware he will almost certainly be nominated when Academy Awards
time comes round next year.
Tom Hanks, affable light comedian turned superstar and man in the
designer anorak, plays astronaut Jim Lovell in the film about the Nasa
mission which set off to land on the moon eight months after Neil
Armstrong had taken his small step for mankind. The ship suffered an
explosion in an oxygen tank due to a faulty electrical connection and
had to be brought back to earth somehow by Mission Control or the
corpses of the crew of three -- Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert --
would have spent eternity whirling around space in a flying crypt, a
gruesome satellite if ever there was.
The fact that most people have forgotten which mission was which is
neither here nor there. Apollo 13 was not the last, but it was one of
the most dramatic and Lovell duly became an American hero. Who better to
play him, therefore, than Hollywood's current American hero, Tom
''Gump'' Hanks?
On his 1996 Oscar chances, he was modest. ''I don't think it is a Best
Actor kind of movie,'' he said. He had, of course, done a great job,
better than anyone could, but he would be shocked if he was nominated.
Then he listed all the people in the cast and crew whom he thought
should be up for Oscars for their work on what is a complicated and
spectacular film.
Would he have liked to have been an astronaut? ''There is no way I
could be -- the problem is I am just not good enough at the math -- but
if by some circumstance they said: 'Tom, we would like to send a movie
star into space, we would like it to be you' I would enter a very select
group,'' he said. ''I don't think I would be scared, but I would need
some training. I would have to learn a couple of things.''
He described Lovell, with whom he spent four days at his home in Texas
preparing for the film, as a very easy-going guy, full of humour, who
had all his priorities in place. ''He is a space junkie,'' Hanks said.
''He likes everything about space. To be able for the opportunity to go
there he had to be a rocket scientist, a test pilot, an engineer, and
maybe even a PhD, and that takes a lot of work and years of application.
He is very dedicated and extremely competitive, but it is hidden behind
an easy-going veneer. Like all those guys he wanted to beat everyone
else to get the job. If you asked him he would confess that he hoped
Neil Armstrong would break his leg a couple of weeks before June 1969,
so that he could have been the first man to walk on the moon.''
Is he, too, a space junkie? He disowns the title. ''I am a space
aficionado, a space nut, a lay scholar,'' he said. He had worried before
accepting the role whether anybody would ''buy'' him as the commander of
a space ship, but he had wanted to be in the film so badly he would have
played Haise if unsuitable for Lovell. He had enjoyed wearing the
pressure suits, and coped with the vomitarium, the simulation chamber in
which the gravity free scenes were shot. He could also remember the real
mission taking place, he said.
''I grew up in San Francisco and I watched it on TV and when I learned
what was wrong the hairs stood up on the back of my head. I knew exactly
the danger they were facing, as best as someone in his thirteenth year
could. I knew, should this crew die, it would mean three corpses
rotating around the moon for the rest of existence.''
Forrest Gump was a phenomenon he could not explain, he said in the
tones of someone laughing all the way to the bank, but he hoped people
were not getting fed up with him, and that he faced a long and lucrative
career in pictures. Should they get bored with him at the age of 50 he
would not take up golf, he would instead learn to fly.

John Fowler savours the atmosphere of Caithness's annual Northlands
Festival, which has linked up with Scandinavian countries in what is
becoming a cultural beacon on the northern boundary of Europe.
IT'S half past six in the evening as we gather under a threatening sky
at the little harbour of Staxigoe, a rocky haven round the corner from
Wick. Staxigoe is a tiny inlet hemmed in by a horseshoe of grass cliff.
Fingers of slabby rock shelve into the Pentland Firth and a weird pepper
pot of rock juts up like a natural beacon.
This is the setting for a truly magical piece of open-air theatre
performed this week as part of the Northlands Festival in Caithness by
Rubicon, a group of contemporary dancers from Sweden.
The show starts in silence as black-dressed dancers appear silhouetted
on the clifftop, then the drums and synthesised soundtrack build and
relax tension at critical moments in the drama. Finally ominous orange
smoke bellows into the sky, already flecked with stray hints of the
setting sun.
The dancers clamber over the sea rocks, group together in haunted
poses, or race across the foreshore. At last they plunge into the chill
sea (we hope a hot shower and bowls of soup await them). They spread
their shawls like nets in the water and the leaping spray resembles a
catch writhing in the web.
Rubicon's strange and compelling performance has probably been the
highlight of this week's Northlands Festival, an annual event in
Caithness since 1992. Northlands, always designed to bring work to
Scotland from neighbouring northern countries, has now expanded to
involve linked festivals in Scandinavian venues.
Northlands festivals took place in the Swedish town of Uddevalla early
this month, then in the Danish town of Fredrikshavn, and now in Wick,
Thurso and smaller Caithness communities.
In Caithness, the attractions include a symphony concert, the
percussionist Evelyn Glennie, chamber opera, song and music recitals,
theatre, and two concerts of varied appeal by Ally Bain and Phil
Cunningham and the Celtic rock groups Wolfstone and Shooglenifty. Art
exhibitions include work by the Swedish water-colourist Lars Lerin.
The first festivals were run by Ferelith Lean (best known as director
of Glasgow early Mayfest) who was called back this year as artistic
director though she now lives and works in Stockholm. From the start the
local MP, Robert MacLennan -- now president of the Liberal Democrats --
has been a prime mover.
''Just when I thought Northlands was behind me,'' says Lean, ''Robert
MacLennan phoned me and said 'I've an idea' -- beware of MacLennans with
ideas. 'Why don't we make it a three-country festival?'''
This was in December, and by January talks were taking place with
Swedish and Danish cultural representatives. ''Although all the arts
money -- and they talk serious money in Sweden -- had been allocated
they managed to squeeze something out of their budget,'' says Lean.
''They've been tremendously enthusiastic.
''Denmark has been a bit trickier. Just at the last minute the small
town of Fredrikshavn on the east coast of Jutland has come in, so as a
result this month we've had festivals in the Swedish town Uddevalla,
then Fredrikshavn and now Caithness.''
But there's more to come. ''There's a town in Norway -- which I won't
name yet -- which we hope will become part of Northlands next year,
making it a four-nation festival. The idea is that each place will
originate one major event of national importance which will tour the
other countries during September, with many more local events in each
centre.''
Lean was delighted with last week's opening concert by the BBC
Scottish Symphony Orchestra (with Danish conductor and Finnish soloist)
in the the Assembly Rooms at Wick. ''We had an enormous audience,'' she
says. ''If we could find a sponsor we'd love to have a symphony
orchestra start the festival in each place.''
The seeds of cultural change have already been sewn. Rubicon danced on
the rocks at Uddevalla (less slippery with seaweed than Staxigoe, they
say) though money wouldn't run to a performance in Denmark. The Scottish
artists Neil McPherson and Douglas Thomson are exhibiting work in
Sweden. The Danish puppeteer Hanne Trolle played to children in
Uddevalla before coming to Wick and Thurso. Dave Anderson performed his
Wildcat solo show, called 47, in all three countries. And so on.
One event Caithness missed was big-band jazz which toured Sweden and
Denmark. And, of course, the Murray Pipes and Drums -- Swedish, believe
it or not -- which drew admiring crowds in the streets of Uddevalla.
''The principle's in place and Norway's banging on the door to get
in,'' says Lean. ''We're holding a meeting in Gothenburg -- the most
central place for us all -- in October, and we hope it will set the ball
in motion for a festival of four countries in 1995.''

To most people, Leslie Caron will be forever Gigi -- but, finds
William Russell, she is now a successful businesswoman who is able to
pick and choose her film roles with relish.
SHE is forever Gigi. Leslie Caron, however, whose latest film,
Funnybones, premiered at the Drambuie Film Festival in Edinburgh last
month, is not a one-film star. One of her big British successes, The
L-Shaped Room, was the subject of a scene-by-scene lecture she gave on
Saturday night and the others are equally memorable, notably An American
in Paris, the film which launched her Hollywood career in 1951 at the
age of 18.
She has just finished seven months playing the ballerina in the
musical version of Vicki Baum's Grand Hotel in Berlin, but most of her
attention is focused on the auberge, La Lucarne aux Chouettes (the Owl's
Nest), she has opened south of Paris. As for her career, she says that
at last she has really enjoyed making films. ''It is sheer pleasure
working -- somehow all the demons have gone and it is just pleasure and
fun. If I don't like doing it, I don't do it. I am full of enthusiasm
for everything now.''
Gene Kelly discovered her dancing in the ballet in Paris and cast her
in An American in Paris, introducing her to the Hollywood studio system.
''I found it very offensive, never having any contact with the boss,''
she said. ''Orders would be carried down and you never met the person
who took decisions about you. I think they should have called you in to
talk about what they wanted you to do, there should have been an
exchange of views, we are having this written for you, how do you like
it? It would have made for much easier and pleasanter times. As it is,
most times friends would call up and say they had read in the trade
papers I was going to do a film called Lili, and I would call my agent
and ask if it was true. It creates fear.''
She worked with both of Hollywood's great dancers, Kelly and Astaire,
the latter in Daddy Longlegs. ''They were both very exacting, but that
is quite normal because ballet is always very painful to do --
everything aches, it is not easy,'' she said. ''But you expect that. It
is a world where the choreographer is very severe, the ballet master is
a tyrant. Fred was exacting, but he was also kind and polite. Gene was
harder to please. It is his nature. He loves to direct, to be in
control, whereas Astaire used to delegate. A lot of the choreography on
his films was done by him but he always had someone else's name on the
credits. It was a matter of discretion. He was very modest. It is very
difficult to be the leading man and also in charge.''
She appeared opposite Cary Grant in Father Goose -- he played a beach
bum who came to the rescue of a group of schoolchildren and their
teacher, a nun, played by Caron, trapped on a South Sea island by the
Japanese. ''I had a lot of respect for Cary -- he taught me a lot about
comedy -- but he had a dual personality,'' she said.
''He would be enchanting for an hour, he would amuse you and sing
songs, and then suddenly he would become very fussy and difficult. He
was quite mercurial. He had a strange mania. By the time I worked with
him -- 1964 -- I think it was not so easy for him to learn lines. When
we started a new scene we would go to his trailer and read it together.
He had a little black book in which all the jokes were written. The
script was by Peter Stone, who is a very good writer of comedy, but he
would say: 'Let us see if we can do better'. He would do this with the
whole scene and would play it as we had written it. Two hours would go
by and he would say 'I don't think we can better the original'. So
little by little we would go back to it and by the end Cary had learned
his lines.
''He was not a simple person. He was complex. But he was not
difficult. Difficult is stupid and I had perhaps one or at most two
leading men like that, but not Cary.''
She said she was much more daring in what she accepted now. She had,
for instance, refused a role in the Cole Porter musical Les Girls,
thinking she could not play the role, which went to Taina Elg. Now she
would have taken it. ''I absolutely adore George Cukor, who directed, so
it would have been fun,'' she said. ''I also refused to do a film with
Clark Gable. People pass out when I say that. But the script was bad, I
thought I would never be able to get anything out of the material.'' The
part went to Miss Elg, but since neither of us could remember the film
she was probably wise to refuse it.
''I was the one who suggested Gigi,'' she said. ''Arthur Freed, the
great producer of MGM musicals, had come to see me on the set of Lili
and said -- My poor Leslie, what are they doing to you? That make-up.
You look like something the cat brought home. I have to do another film
to save your career. Any ideas? I said what about Gigi? He said he would
get back to me. It took a little time because Colette had so many
husbands and lovers that the rights were disseminated and he had
problems with the censors -- censorship was very tight in these days in
Hollywood -- because it was about the education of a courtesan and he
had to be discreet about that.''
In fact, Freed was wrong about Lili. She received an Oscar nomination
for the role and won a Bafta. It also includes the song Hi-lili, Hi-lo
which she sang. It became a hit. She dismissed it as ''a little-girl
song''. In Gigi she does not sing the songs, although her voice is used
at the start of some of them, but she did sing St Louis Blues in a film
with Louis Armstrong and Jack Teagarden. She loves singing and says that
in the next life she would like to be a Mozart singer.
''I did not like dancing in films,'' she added. ''I found it terribly
difficult. The floors were always cement, always shiny and slippery. To
dance you have to be in front of the public. That is the important part,
the feedback from the audience. I kept my acting and dancing careers
going together for about five years, but it was hard working on films,
learning English, learning to act and keeping in training.''
As for Funnybones, Peter Chelsom claimed to have written the role for
her, which she found very flattering. ''My agent sent the script saying
she did not know if I would like it, but I read it and thought
immediately this is a great script, but I don't understand it,'' she
said. ''I have always found it terribly easy to read a script, but this
one was very spare. There were no descriptions. Usually they put in
parenthesis how the actors are supposed to look and feel so I asked if
he would write a synopsis. He wrote one and sent me a cassette of Hear
My Song, which I found totally charming so I said yes.''
But now it is the auberge which takes up her time. It was like running
a small factory, she said. Terribly exacting. ''I live there, I come and
say hello and chat to the customers, and I have a lot to do,'' she said.
''It takes about three years to balance the budget, to find out how many
staff you need, how to do things in the most economic way. I also do the
artistic side, choose the cards, design the menus. At first it was
terrifying because I did not know what I was doing. Now I am enjoying
it.''
And that was that. She is living proof that little girls do grow up in
the most delightful way!

THEY say that variety is dead, but for many people it is still the
spice of life. So much so that there is a substantial audience out there
for the good old days of the dancers, the comedian, the comedy feed, the
sister act, the tenor, the soprano, the dance act, the speciality act.
That audience is being fed by a show going out on Monday nights on
Radio 2, Scottish Music Hall, produced by Radio Scotland's Dave
Batchelor. ''It's hosted by Johnny Beattie and stars the Usual Suspects
of Scottish music hall that we have known and loved for the last
goodness knows how many years,'' Batchelor said. ''The programme is
based on the Darwinian principle that all the best survive and all the
oldest jokes are the funniest.''
That may or not be true; judge for yourself with this chestnut from
the series:
Man: I'll never forget the day I proposed to you and you nearly fell
out of bed with shock. Woman: So what made you want to marry me? Was it
my beautiful eyes? Man: Naw. Woman: Was it my flowing locks? Man: Naw.
Woman: Was it my tasty cooking? Man: Naw. Woman: Oh, I give up! Man:
Yes, that was it!
Johnny Beattie himself has been involved in the music-hall
tradition from his earliest years. 'The very first summer variety show I
did was when I was top of the bill in 1955,'' he said. ''It was North
Berwick and we changed the show twice weekly, two shows a night and I
was a young comic with very little material, if any.''
In those days a summer season of variety meant more than just playing
while the sun shone. ''One summer season in the Gaiety Theatre, Ayr, I
did a summer season of 27 weeks. We finished on November 15 and on the
last week I was driving from Ayr to Glasgow through snow drifts to
rehearse pantomime at the Glasgow Empire.''
The programme involves the acts of the recent past which have
stood the test of time and talent: Una McLean, Peter Morrison, Kenneth
McKellar and Jimmy Logan just to name a few. ''The revelation is Kenneth
McKellar, believe it or not, and no-one ever believes Ken is a funny
man,'' says Batchelor. ''He has written a new song which is hugely funny
and he sings it on the last programme. Everyone who hears it wants to
perform it.''
* Scottish Music Hall is on Radio 2 on Mondays at 10pm.

Australian exile TONI HETHERINGTON attends a reunion -- and has a nose
for a story.
AT FIRST I found it quite unnerving. As I walked into the gathering of
people, a sea of strange faces stared at me as if I should have been
familiar to them.
I could see their minds ticking over, wondering who I was, was I
really one of them, where did I fit in to the scheme of things? And this
was all before I opened my mouth to let loose my naturally broad,
twanging Australian accent.
To their credit, although it was obvious I didn't belong to these
parts, they welcomed me with open arms. And why not? My surname is
Hetherington and the occasion was a Hetherington Family Gathering at
historic Lanercost Priory in Cumbria.
Yes, that's right, Hetherington without an A.
I'd learned of the event after reading an advertisement in The Herald.
The get-together was held and organised by Sheila Hetherington of Arran,
who is ''one of us'' by marriage. Her husband Alastair is a former
Herald reporter and was editor of the Guardian from 1956-75.
It was her idea to ''arrange a small gathering of her husband's
immediate family'' which gradually became bigger and bigger.
About 100 people from across Great Britain attended, with a few
foreigners thrown in from America, Northern Ireland and, of course, my
good self on a working holiday from the Land Down Under.
It was the first official gathering of our ''family'' since 1569 --
you could say we had a lot of catching up to do. Everyone was hopeful of
discovering a missing link in their family trees, or like myself finding
a long-lost (and perhaps filthy rich) relative.
Being far from home, I went along fairly unprepared. I know little of
my family's history, so had my well-informed Auntie Julie, from
Australia, send me a few details before the gathering.
Ironically, as I now live and work in Glasgow, I discovered that my
great-great-grandfather, William Wallace Hetherington, was born in
Glasgow in 1836 and sailed to Melbourne on the Marco Polo, arriving
December 6, 1856.
A tile cutter by trade, he married Jane Clark nine years later and
they settled in a small goldmining town called Muckleford near my home
town of Bendigo (also founded during the boom goldrush years), and they
gave birth to the Aussie alliance.
A Scottish connection -- no wonder I feel so at home in Glasgow!
Later in the day we were told that Hetheringtons were traditionally
tall and rangey in stature with blue-grey or hazel eyes, and a
prominently large nose.
After I'd finished nervously touching my petite button nose, I used my
distinctly green eyes to scan the crowd to see if anyone looked similar
to me.
No luck. I couldn't see any sign of cheeks with dimples or faces
smacked with freckles (I prefer sunkisses, as my mother used to call
them).
I began talking about family features to a Perthshire family and
mentioned my wee brother, Phillip. For years my older sister, Natalie,
and I were jealous of his almost-white blonde hair, blue eyes,
deliciously long dark eye-lashes and olive skin which tans to a
chocolate colour when the weatherman simply mentions the word sun.
Not an unusual appearance it seems as Pam, from Blairgowrie, explained
I had just described her two sons. Another connection.
Talk flowed throughout the day, Hetheringtons are never short of a
word or 200, and I learned some interesting facts.
Originating from the Borders area near Carlisle, Hethersgill, and
Triermain, the Hetheringtons were well-known reivers between the
fourteenth and seventeenth centuries. Without doubt we lent a helping
hand to the Armstrongs, Grahams and other bloodthirsty rogues during
killings and raids to steal cattle in order to survive the hard times.
However, few indictments can be found against the family name in court
records -- well, apart from one minor incident. Apparently we tried,
unsuccessfully, to bump off the Bishop of Carlisle in 1569 and faced a
charge of plotting to kill him. (I suspect he made fun of our prominent
noses.)
Other Hetheringtons opted for the less violent, but no more glamorous,
occupation of collecting taxes and blackmail money.
Word soon spread among the gathering that I was from Australia and
curious people approached me for more information. Incredibly, Bendigo
proved to be another roundabout link. The central Victorian town is
roughly 10,000 miles south, but people knew it, had driven through it,
and one couple had even considered retiring there.
Small world.
At the end of the day, it was decided to compile a list of
Hetheringtons so we could all keep in touch and compare family trees.
The possibility of another gathering was mooted.
What a good idea, I thought. Maybe next time I can arrange for all of
them to walk into a sea of Hetheringtons with strange Australian faces.

THE visitor to London used to be able to return home laden with
goodies from the shelves of either Mr Fortnum and Mr Mason, Harvey
Nicholls' deli or Mr Mohammed al Fayed's food hall in Harrods.
Finding something that is not on sale in the delicatessan section of
one's local super market, however, so much have they improved, can be a
problem these days for anyone looking for that slightly different
gastronomic present.
There is, however, a new place to shop, although Messrs Al Fayed,
Fortnum, Mason and Nicholls can rest easy. They will still reign supreme
when it comes to buying really rare goodies.
For social cachet, however, it is hard to beat delicacies bought in
the Cafe Royal, that palatial Regent Street collection of restaurants
and dining rooms where Oscar Wilde once held court.
A new venture for the Cafe Royal, inspired partly because some of
their business is corporate entertaining and corporate entertainers like
to gift gifts, the Fine Dining Collection has been compiled with great
care. There is a price for every pocket.
While companies like to mark an occasion, people dining in the
restaurants have also been known to ask whether they could buy the
splendid blue glass water goblets, a special Cafe Royal feature, as a
souvenir. They can now.
As with everything there, it is all terribly discreet -- the shop also
masquerades as the reception. The aim is not to attract people off the
street, but to persuade diners to spend a little more. All the same,
those who pop in from the street will not be turned away.
Because the place is associated with fine wining and dining, the food
items in the list of 30 on sale are all used in their kitchens by the
chef, Herbert Berger, whose grill room has a Michelin star.
They include choice olive oils (#4.50), a truly amazingly tasty
Pumpkin Seed oil (#8.70) ideal for pouring over artichokes, assorted
dried mushroom mixtures at prices ranging from #2.20 for dried cepes to
#14.40 for rare dried morels, mustards, coffees and luxury stuffed
prunes (#6.50). There are phials of peppercorns, black, white, green and
pink at prices ranging from #1.80 to #2.60, and labelled bottles of Cafe
Royal claret and white Bordeaux at #8.50. Although it no longer boasts
the finest cellar in London, it has one of the finest.
Those covetable blue glasses cost #4.95, and there is a range of aids
to open one's wine and help taste it properly at prices ranging from
#3.50 for an old vintage cork screw to #30 for a folding pocket cork
screw ideal for the picnic hamper at a posh race meeting.
For the madly extravagant, or the seriously rich, there is gilt
decanting cradle (#150) and a silver gilt stand which will hold three
bottles of olive oil (#48).
Should you wish to flaunt your links with the Bohemians of old, they
are selling T-shirts with quotations from Wilde -- ''I can resist
everything but temptation'' and ''We are all in the gutter, but some of
us are looking at the stars.''

* WHEN John Major met the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble this
week, the small talk may well have turned to Gingerbread Men, rather
than goldfish.
The recipe for their favourite biscuit has been donated by the PM and
Norma Major to Recipes For Peace. It's one of many celebrity
contributions to the #4.99 paperback, whose royalties go to Children For
Change.
The charity sponsors events and holidays for children from different
religions and backgrounds in Northern Ireland, encouraging them to set
aside sectarian distrust.
Gloria Hunniford, Senator Edward Kennedy, Richard Wilson, and Lady
Glasgow are among famous names featured. Anyone tempted to take 4oz of
butter, one tbsp of black treacle etc, for the Majors' recipe should
note it makes 18 gingerbread men -- five fewer than the cabinet.
Recipes For Peace, compiled by Marie Roche, is published by Vermilion
on October 5.
* MORE than any time of year, Christmas is a family occasion, and the
idea of taking a stranger into your home may seem foreign.
But that's the mission of HOST, which, with the backing of the foreign
and Commonwealth Office, aims to place overseas students with British
families at the festive season, Easter or weekends.
Christmas can be a particularly lonely time for anyone far from home,
and the charity is inviting Scots to live up to their reputation for
hospitality and share the holiday with a student from abroad.
According to HOST regional director Hazel Rowe, it's a rewarding
experience that fosters international friendship and understanding.
For details of the scheme contact Mrs Rowe at Scrabster House, Thurso,
Caithness, KW14 7UN, Phone: 01847 892303.
* THE Scottish Office is looking for grown-ups who want to go back to
school -- but you needn't apply if your name is Brandon Lee, aka Brian
McKinnon.
In line with the Citizen's Charter, HM Inspectors of Schools now
include a lay person in their inspection teams.
More men and women with an interest in education are being invited to
register as members to ensure parent and other interests are taken into
account.
The work is voluntary but expenses are paid. If you're interested in
training to be a lay member, are between 30 and 62 and have not been
employed as a teacher, write for an application for to the Scottish
Office, Room 110 (LM) 16 Waterloo Place, Edinburgh, EH1 3DN.
* KEEN swimmers in Scotland are being urged to take the plunge to
fight asthma. Three million people in Britain suffer from the complaint
-- a third of them children -- and numbers are growing with traffic
pollution.
During National Asthma Week (October 9 to 15) and throughout the month
it's hoped to raise more than #175,000 for research and advice with
sponsored swimmers clocking up 4650 miles, the distance round Britain's
coastline.
For details of joining in the Great British Swim contact Lorna Smith
at the National Asthma Campaign, Providence House, Providence Place,
London, N1 0NT.
* THE #177m of fresh mushrooms eaten in Britain this year would
stretch from Edinburgh to London every day of the year.
Nutritionally, they also go a long way in satisfying health needs. Low
in fat, calories and salt, their mineral content helps maintain heart
rhythm and circulation -- especially valuable for the elderly -- and the
increasing number of vegetarians benefit from B12 content that's rare in
other vegetables.
The Mushroom Bureau would like us to cultivate the habit still more
and has produced a free leaflet featuring Mushroom Goulash, Mushroom
Risotto, Lasagne, Piquant Sauce and other recipes.
For a copy of Mushroom Medley, send a large sae to Creephedge House,
East Hanningfield, Chelmsford, CM3 8BP.
* HAVE BT slipped up on their own banana skin? An advert claiming 10
minutes' local weekend chat costs less than a banana reckoned without a
green-grocer in Edinburgh's West End.
Mr Yousaf Hussein proudly boasts ''the cheapest bananas in town'' -- a
credible claim at a mere 10p a pound.
In a demonstration, his bananas weighed in at a third the cost of the
one in the advert. So will BT -- who included Oxford Street to arrive at
an average 11p for a banana -- honour their promise, and give Mr
Hussein's customers 30 minutes' talk time?
''Certainly not,'' snorted Simon, from Corporate Affairs. ''We've
checked with our lawyers and the public must accept our banana.''
At the BT shop in Princes Street an assistant was more sympathetic:
''It sounds perfectly logical to me,'' he said. But pleaded: ''Please
don't offer to pay bills with bananas. That would send us . . .
bananas.''

If you go down to the supermarket today, you're in for more than a big
surprise, finds Anna Burnside.
SHOPPING, according to one of the eighties' wittier sloganisers, is
capitalist yoga. It has become the nation's favourite leisure activity
with supermarkets the nerve centres of our car-centric communities.
Safeway, Sainsbury, Presto and Asda are among Britain's most
profitable firms, spending millions making sure they stay that way.
There's even a television series, Off Your Trolley to deconstruct
exactly how they do it.
The first superstores, built in the mid 1960s, were dreary discount
sheds selling bargain bread. Everything changed at the end of the 1970s,
when a price war between Sainsbury and Tesco boosted sales and gave them
profits to invest. Tesco, and then the other companies, realised that
they would never win on price alone. They had to make customers want to
come to their stores.
This new mood coincided with the consumer booming eighties, when
shoppers became less fixated by price. We were busy people with plenty
of cash and credit cards. We did not want to push our trolleys round
dingy stores piled with cheap margarine and beans. We wanted to drive up
in our new cars then treat ourselves to a week's worth of goodies.
Giant supermarkets, selling up to 30,000 different lines from
custom-built sheds (football pitches six metres high, according to one
architect) mushroomed up and down the country. Old stores were given a
facelift with new corporate images, out-of-town sites were snapped up.
A new superstore can cost up to #6m to build, excluding the land.
That's a a lot of chicken Kiev and Bulgarian cabernet sauvignon.
Unlike the first wave of utilitarian stores, the new supermarkets were
carefully designed using sophisticated psychology to part us from our
pounds. It's no coincidence that supermarkets from Stornoway to Selkirk
have fruit and vegetables at the entr ance; fish, meat, delicatessen
along the back of the store and special offers at the top end of each
aisle. These are all devices to stimulate our desires.
Steve Miles, lecturer in leisure, culture and consumption at the
sociology department of Glasgow University, sees supermarkets attempting
to recreate the high street atmosphere which no longer exists because of
the growth of out-of-town superstores. Separate newsagents, pharmacies,
dry cleaners, travel agents, creches, opticians, hairdressers, coffee
shops and free noticeboards soften the edges of a supermarket.
He chose Safeway in Anniesland, in one of the most desirable
supermarket locations in Scotland, as a text-book example of the latest
in retail thinking.
At the entrance, there's a post office counter, an attempt to create a
community feeling.
''People go on about malls being the cathedrals of modern society --
this is like the community centre. They're trying to create an
impression that it's not just a functional thing you're doing here,
they're trying for a homely, friendly, inviting atmosphere.
''Luscious fruit and vegetables, with their aura of vitamins and
vitality now wreath the entrances of most supermarkets.''
Their glowing goodness is infectious, according to Miles. They create
a friendly, light environment and look so healthy and attractive that
you think you should be healthy too. They encourage you to buy some
fresh vegetables because they are the first thing you see. Who could
resist those frilly-topped carrots or the baby pineapples?
The luscious fresh produce leads up to the back wall of the store,
identified on Off Your Trolley by Dr Roy Bradshaw of Nottingham
University as a ''hot spot'', one of the busiest, most profitable parts
of the supermarket.
Miles agrees: ''It's obvious -- when you are going back and forwards
down the aisles you've got to end up at the end, so that's where all the
opulence is.''
The ends of the aisles, gondolas in shop-speak, are highly profitable
hot spots. It's no coincidence that special offers on the store's own
goods, or highly-promoted deals from major manufacturers end up there --
the rumour is that brand managers have to offer substantial discounts to
secure these desirable shelves.
Sure enough, Safeway gondolas have Tetley tea bags with free figures,
their own three-for-the price-of-two offer and a back to school fridge
full of chocolate milk and processed cheese, ideal for those with pester
power to pack for lunch.
Within the main shelves there are further trolley traps.
Own-brand goods are on the left of the famous names, such as Heinz or
Nescafe.
We look from left to right and spot the own brand can, which is almost
certainly cheaper to the customer but more profitable for the store. The
tempting items that we don't know we want until we see them are on the
eye-level shelf, to encourage lucrative impulse purchases.
The dull essentials, the tinned tomatoes or bags of rice, are down at
the bottom. They are important enough to bend down for. They are also
dotted throughout the aisles and moved regularly, to keep us alert and
make sure we move through the whole of the building.
Items that go together are often placed together. Coffee and biscuits
are an obvious team; tortilla chips and paper plates not quite so well
matched -- until you are throwing a party.
Alcohol is right at the end. If we bought it at the beginning, experts
believe, we would be horrified by the cost and spend less on other
things. By the end of the trudge, we are ready to pick up a four pack
and a bottle of Rioja and get the hell out.
Lighting is important too. The fresh produce is displayed in as much
natural light as possible whereas the toiletries and vitamins are
displayed in a bright, clinical environment. Steve Miles noticed the
difference.
''Suddenly you're in a nice bright environment again, it feels like
you're in your own bathroom.'' In Anniesland there is also a separate
pharmacy, which he reckons has as much to do with suggesting a high
street ambience as selling headache pills.
Even Safeway makes less effort with the goods that everybody needs to
buy. The dogfood aisle has cans sitting in their cases, just like the
discount stores do. Kwik Save, Netto, Lidl and Aldi opened stores in
Scotland as a recession-driven reaction to the luxurious superstores.
By selling a tiny range of goods -- up to 3000 in Kwik Save, 700 in
the others -- at low prices they have brought price back into the battle
for customers.
Those 700 lines just happen to be the ones the major players have
chosen for their own cheap and cheerful brands. The message is that if
you shop with them, you can park in the car park, have your bun in the
coffee shop, get your pumpkin ravioli and Greek yoghurt and still save
on crisps and coke.
The most extravagant person can go to Aldi and have a hard time
spending a tenner because there is so little choice. An iron-willed
miser would have a hard time sticking rigidly to a shopping list in a
sparkling new superstore because the whole place is designed to make
sure that never happens.

AIRPORT chiefs are considering an extension to Edinburgh Airport as
passenger numbers continue to grow.
A spokeswoman for Scottish Airports Ltd, which has responsibility for
Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Glasgow airports, said talks were under way
over the possibility of a new building at the terminal.
''Edinburgh is the fastest-growing airport within the group, with
regard to passenger numbers,'' she said.
Recent figures show a growth of 7.7% in August alone.
The increase is part of a continuing trend, which saw the airport
handle more than three million passengers in 1994.
Earlier this year, Globespan launched summer charter flights direct
from Edinburgh to New York, and Direct Holidays announced it is to fly
passengers from Edinburgh to 11 new holiday destinations from next
summer.
The proposal was greeted with enthusiasm by the leader of Edinburgh
District Council, Councillor Lesley Hinds, who said: ''This sounds like
good news for Edinburgh. It is important both for business and tourism.
''Obviously, there will have to be talks about how any new development
will fit in with the community surrounding the airport.''
The possibility of an extension was also welcomed by the chairman of
Lothian region's transportation committee, Councillor David Begg.
Mr Begg said: ''We will be very supportive of this. It has been our
view that Edinburgh should be a major international airport.''
''We want to see it expanded.''
If the plans go ahead, Mr Begg said they would tie in with region
proposals for new rail links and a busway.

THE ''green'' renewal of Glasgow's most ancient house won the overall
prize at the Scottish environmental regeneration awards yesterday.
St Nicholas Garden at Provand's Lordship, a medieval hospital manse in
Castle Street, was commended for its use of natural materials,
sculpture, and ''delicate'' recreation of a medieval herbal or
''physic'' garden.
The garden was opened in June by the Princess Royal.
The designer, Mr Gary Johnson, 28, of Glasgow-based James Cunning
Young and Partners, said: ''Hopefully the award will help people
recognise the importance of quality of thought in design and not just
the use of expensive materials.''
Mr Johnson won a competition by funders Glasgow Development Agency to
secure the project.
In its citation, the judging panel said it had been impressed by the
number and high standard of urban entries but added there had been
''disappointingly few ecological and wildlife conservation projects.''
Other winning initiatives were: the restoration of a Victorian garden
at the Glen Grant Distillery, Rothes; the redevelopment of Fairfield
housing project, Perth, and the new fronting of Tower Place, Leith.

SCOTLAND has suffered nearly 5000 job losses this year, the highest
number of any of Britain's countries or regions, according to a survey
published by Labour today.
The findings, based on media reports, suggest that nearly 100,000 jobs
have been lost across Britain so far. In Scotland, 24 companies have
shed 4889 jobs.
This puts Scotland considerably ahead of the north-west of England,
where 3536 jobs have gone, and the West Midlands, which has lost 3166.
Of the Scottish-based employers listed, the largest number of jobs
shed was 1000 by Strathclyde Regional Council; the smallest, seven, by
Scottish Aids Monitor.
Ms Hilary Armstrong, Labour Treasury spokeswoman, said 1,500,000 jobs
had been lost since Mr Major became Prime Minister.
''Unemployment destroys the confidence, livelihood, and hope of
individuals. The constant threat of redundancy can be almost as
devastating,'' she said.
Unemployment has fallen in Britain for 24 months in a row. In
September, it fell to less than 2.3m, or 8.2% of the workforce. In
Scotland, unemployment fell to 7.9%, lower than the national average.

PLANEMAKERS in Prestwick are set to enjoy a share of British
Aerospace's latest order from Germany for its RJ85 regional jet,
following a #650m order by Belgium's Sabena airline last month.
Lufthansa said yesterday it would buy 17 planes, worth about #774m,
from British, US, Canadian, and European manufacturers. Four would
replace older planes, while 13 would expand its fleet.
Five 82-seater Avro RJ85 jets, manufactured in Britain, will become
part of Lufthansa's European fleet. It will also add four Boeing
747-400s, manufactured in Seattle, and one European Airbus A340 to its
international fleet.
Last month's order by the Belgian airline for 23 of the RJ85 aircraft
was the biggest single order for regional jet aircraft won by BAe's
subsidiary, Avro International Aerospace.
It safeguarded 2500 jobs at Prestwick, where the wings are built;
Woodford, near Manchester, where the jets are assembled; and Filton,
Bristol, where the fuselage is made.

A ''troublesome'' cat was suspected yesterday of dialling 999, and
sparking off an alert which led to police breaking down the door of a
flat.
Computer programmer Angus Moncrieff, 25, was at work in Aberdeen when
the police received a 999 call traced back to his flat in the city's
Urquhart Terrace.
Police found the door locked and no signs of activity inside and,
because they thought there might be someone in distress inside, had to
break down the door.
A spokesman said: ''Inside we found the telephone on the floor, off
the hook. The only thing moving was the cat.
''I know it sounds strange but the cat could have pressed the key
accidentally, thus causing it to repeat, having already knocked the
receiver off. All I can say is that it has happened before.''
Mr Moncrieff said: ''I was using the telephone last night and left it
on the floor. Mooca has always been a troublesome cat and has been worse
lately but, to the best of my knowledge, has never sparked a security
alert before.''

EDINBURGH District Council has warned the Government that planned
changes to the Housing Benefit Scheme will increase the number of
homeless on the streets of the capital.
Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors claimed yesterday that
restrictions on the sum the council could pay to help private-sector
tenants meet rent bills would increase evictions, may put some small
private landlords out of business, and increase homelessness.
Housing convener Councillor Mary Mulligan told a council meeting that
the sum the council could pay out was being reduced by #1.6m, removing
almost all the capacity of councils to make discretionary payments to
vulnerable tenants.
The changes did not recognise housing need, she said, but were being
made to help the Tories cut public spending.
However, she was accused of talking ''alarmist political claptrap'' by
Tory housing spokesman Councillor David Manson, who insisted the changes
would help drive down rents and curb the ''abuse of public money'' by
some private landlords.

<TEXT>
AN industrial tribunal has been told of a secret pact between an
American electronics giant and a small Scottish company.
Under the deal, AT&amp;T and Quality Documentation Solutions, of Stirling,
had an agreement not to recruit anyone within 12 months of that worker
leaving either company.
The tribunal also heard how the managing director and principal
shareholder of QDS, Mr Patrick McDermott, thought that morale in his
office was low and decided that ''by rendering the staff redundant, the
atmosphere in the office would be improved''.
However, the tribunal decided that Miss Margaret Donohue, of The
Square, Ashfield, Dunblane, had not been unfairly dismissed by QDS.
The tribunal heard that QDS produced manuals for hi-tech equipment and
that AT&amp;T accounted for 60% of its turnover.
In the middle of 1994, AT&amp;T decided to change the basis on which it
did business with QDS and Mr McDermott decided he faced the risk of
unprofitable contracts.
He decided to make all of the staff engaged in technical authorship
redundant but offer them the opportunity to work as sub-contractors to
his firm.
Miss Donohue asked to be kept on as a permanent employee but this was
rejected and she was told she was being made redundant on February 10,
1995.
Late in January 1995, Miss Donohue approached AT&amp;T's information
manager Andrew Jack for work as a sub-contractor but the company
''abandoned interest in employing'' the technical author because it
interpreted a letter from Mr McDermott as indicating he ''would be
unhappy'' if any of his former employees were recruited by AT&amp;T.
The tribunal decided ''with considerable reluctance'' that Miss
Donohue's dismissal was not unfair.
It added: ''At the end of the day, the factor which this tribunal
found most troublesome related to the existence of the agreement between
AT&amp;T and the respondents.
''It may well be pertinent to ask on which side the ethical
considerations apply when two companies, behind the backs of their
employees, enter into an agreement to restrict their employees job
opportunities.''

A COUPLE made a plea for help yesterday to find a donor heart for
their 15-year-old daughter, who doctors say has only weeks to live
unless she has a transplant.
Keeley Booth, a promising ballerina who has danced to raise money for
a local hospital, was born with only half a heart. Doctors believed she
would die soon after her birth.
Her father Manus, a detective inspector, from Rivelin, Sheffield,
said: ''Last year, Keeley won a distinction in her ballet exam. This is
remarkable because there are no allowances for disability. The examiners
look for excellence.
''She is a real little fighter and has always defied the odds. It is a
miracle she is here today.''
Making an appeal for a donor heart, he added: ''I know it is a hard
decision for any bereaved parent to make but they can be sure Keeley
would have done the same for them. We had to go through her things
recently and found a donor card.''
The family, including Keeley's brother Darren, 19, are at her bedside
at Harefield Hospital, west London, where surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub is
standing by to perform a transplant.
She was taken there three weeks ago and doctors say her condition has
deteriorated in the last 48 hours.
They hope to find a donor heart from someone who was less than 30
years old and whose blood is group A or O.

A DECISION on the location of a new #25m art gallery in Glasgow is
expected next month.
The disclosure, from district council leader Pat Lally, came just
minutes before members of the city's new shadow council received a
briefing on proposals to establish a National Gallery of Scottish Art in
Glasgow.
Trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland, who will make the
decision, have already announced that their preferred location is the
Post Office building in George Square.
An earlier proposal to locate the gallery in Kelvingrove Park was
dropped because of intense local opposition.
Discussions are now under way with a view to securing an option on the
building, which is now surplus to Post Office requirements.
It is expected that the gallery project would attract 750,000 visitors
per annum, generate around #15m in income, and create 415 new jobs as
well as 900 temporary jobs during construction.

POLICE were still questioning a former employee of a law firm last
night, after a leading solicitor was stabbed to death on his doorstep in
Southampton on Wednesday.
Mr Nigel Lightfoot, 60, described by friends as ''one of the gentlest
people you could meet'', was knifed in the chest three times when he
answered the door to a caller.
He and his wife Susan were at home in Dodwell Lane, Southampton,
Hampshire, on Wednesday evening, when the incident occurred.
Detective Inspector McMullen, of Bitterne CID, said: ''A male person
called at the address. Mr Lightfoot answered the door, whereupon a male
person assaulted him, stabbed him with a knife.''
Mrs Lightfoot telephoned for an ambulance and police arrived at the
house within a few minutes.
''They found a male person, who they spoke to, and they saw Mrs
Lightfoot and her husband, who was bleeding profusely,'' he added.
Mr Lightfoot, who worked with legal firm Lamport Bassitt, was taken to
the Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, but was dead on
arrival.
A man was arrested at the scene and a sheath-knife with a six-inch
blade was recovered. Police have not named the man being questioned but
he is understood to be a 39-year-old who was dismissed from Lamport
Bassitt eight years ago.
He was sacked after being accused of stealing #1.50 and later waged a
campaign to clear his name, staging sit-ins at the firm's offices. He
has been imprisoned three times for breaching court injunctions barring
him from the premises.
Police said they were saddened by the death of Mr Lightfoot, a
well-known and respected lawyer in the town.
Mr McMullen said: ''He was a very prominent figure in the local
comunity, well respected by all members of the legal profession and,
indeed, by people outside that circle.
''I know of nobody who speaks with anything other than respect for
him.''
Mr Lightfoot had been with Lamport Bassitt for virtually all his
working years. He had followed his father, Ray, into the practice, and
his brother, Adrian, is also a partner in the firm.
Colleagues described Mr Lightfoot, a senior partner, as a ''human
dynamo'' whose work was driven by his enthusiasm to help others.
Partner Sean Kelly, who worked alongside him for more than 20 years,
said: ''There was nobody less likely to be hated than Nigel Lightfoot.
''He was a well-known lawyer, very able, well respected, and seen by
us and most other people as one of the gentlest people you could meet.
''He worked harder than anyone. He was very cheerful and positive.
Work had to be fun -- we had to work hard and enjoy it, he was always
telling us that.''
Mr Lightfoot lived with his wife and son James, 22, who recently
completed a university course. He had two daughters, Nicki who lives and
works in London, and Gillian who is in Africa with a safari firm.
He was a keen sailor and well known among the local yachting
community, where he had served as a former commodore of the prestigious
Royal Southern Yacht Club at Hamble, Southampton, from 1987 to 1989.
He was appointed honorary club solicitor in 1982 and had also served
as chairman of the managing committee.
Captain Frank Murphy, present commodore of the RSYC, said Mr Lightfoot
had been a popular member of the club and a keen sailor who ''always
strived for the best''.
He added: ''His cheerful presence will be greatly missed.''

<RECORDNO>976257273</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Law Society is to examine ways of curbing access to the profession
as the number of people trying to become solicitors increasingly
outstrips demand for their skills.
The boom in supply of would-be lawyers has left more than 7000
graduates in England and Wales chasing the 4000 vocational training
contracts available this year.
The oversupply of talent -- the numbers have increased by around 50%
over the last five years -- is seen largely as a result of the expansion
in higher education and the enduring popularity of law degree and legal
conversion courses.
Solicitors' firms say they simply do not have enough work on their
books to employ all those who want to join the profession.
Yesterday, a special meeting of the Law Society's council backed a
motion to set up a working party to consider the oversupply problem.
It will consider whether the number of entrants to the profession
needs to be reduced and, if so, how supply can be matched with demand
for solicitors' services.
Any recommendations are likely to focus on restricting access to the
legal practice course, undertaken by graduates before joining law firms
on training contracts, which is validated by the society.

This year's John McEwen Memorial Lecture will be delivered in Dingwall
today by James Hunter. As suggested by his lecture's title, A Land
Reform Agenda for a Scots Parliament, Dr Hunter will attempt to give new
force to the developing demand for land reform by outlining how such
reform might be achieved legislatively and by demonstrating that a range
of radical reforms could be accomplished at a very modest cost. A
Skye-based historian and broadcaster, James Hunter is chairman of Skye
and Lochalsh Enterprise and a member of Scottish Natural Heritage's
North West Regional Board. He was the founding director of the Scottish
Crofters' Union and he has written several books about the Highlands and
Islands. Here we carry key extracts from the John McEwen Memorial
Lecture.
MOST notably by means of the 1974 legislation which allowed feu-duties
to be bought-out or redeemed, a start has been made on removing from
Scots land law the more self-evidently antique vestiges of feudalism.
But feudalism is at the heart of Scotland's land law still. And this is
indefensible -- not least because of the extent to which feudal
superiors, by virtue of their ability to exercise a veto over the
development of land, can so readily engage in what one commentator calls
''lucrative legalised blackmail''.
At the centre of our land law, then, is the concept that all ownership
rights in land are derived, in the end, from the Crown which, as our
feudal system's paramount superior, not only exercises dominion over the
entire landmass of Scotland but also exercises dominion over everything
below the Scottish landmass, above the Scottish landmass, and -- for
some miles out to sea -- around the Scottish landmass.
This adds up to a lot of real estate. And though Crown rights to much
of it have long since been conveyed to others, the Crown remains in-hand
proprietor, so to speak, of a good deal that is valuable. Not least
among those assets is our territorial seabed -- which, like much of our
shoreline, is Crown property.
Perhaps I should make it clear, at this point, just what I mean by
''Crown''. That term does not refer to Queen Elizabeth personally. It
refers rather to the sovereign power which is certainly symbolised by
the monarch but which is exercised, in practice, by the state.
That is not the end of the matter, however. Remember that the
Declaration of Arbroath, in 1320, insisted that even Robert Bruce,
perhaps our greatest king and very much a feudal monarch, derived his
power from the community of the realm. Recollect the way such doctrines
have resounded through our history ever since. Recall the wording of the
Claim of Right as signed by many eminent Scots in 1989: ''We, gathered
as the Scottish Constitutional Convention, do hereby acknowledge the
sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of
government best suited to their needs.''
If we accept that sovereignty in Scotland resides ultimately in the
people, and if we equally accept that our land laws are founded on the
notion that ownership of land is vested ultimately in the Crown, then it
can be argued -- since the Scottish Crown is finally subordinate to the
people -- that the territory of Scotland should be regarded as
belonging, in the last analysis, to the Scots nation as a whole.
These are matters for constitutional theoreticians. And most of what I
have to say is in no way contingent on them. But it might, all the same,
be symbolically appropriate for a Scots parliament -- which will derive
authority, in terms of the Claim of Right, from Scotland's people -- to
base a Scottish land reform programme on this Scots parliament's own
claim to be, in some over-arching sense, our land's supreme custodian.
Any such land reform programme should certainly start with feudalism's
abolition -- something advocated, incidentally, by the Scottish Law
Commission in 1991.
Taking advantage of the fact that title to land in Scotland is now
being registered more fully than ever before, a Scots parliament --
building on the Law Commission's recommendation that ''the existing
feudal system (be) replaced by a system of absolute ownership'' -- ought
promptly to dispose of all the various superiorities and other
obsolescent feudal relics which allow both individuals and institutions
to exercise rights over land ostensibly in the ownership of others.
#10m to buy out the crofting landlords
Just as responsibility for the seabed should be transferred from the
Crown Estate Commissoners to coastal communities, so control of the
state-owned crofting estates which are today administered by the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department (SOAFD) should be
made over to people living on these estates.
And while the Forestry Commission might continue to have a role in
developing new woodlands, existing commission plantations should,
wherever possible, be transferred to such rural communities, individual
farmers, or locally resident landowners as want to acquire them.
The overall aim of such reforms would be to expand local ownership,
and thus to enhance local control, both of land and of other natural
resources. This could be brought about directly by an Act of the Scots
parliament. It is more probable, however, that some officially sponsored
body, provisionally labelled here a Land Commission, will be required to
handle the various practicalities -- legal, financial, and otherwise --
of the different reforms I am urging.
Nor should a Land Commission's role end with its helping to dispose of
state-owned land of the Forestry Commission or SOAFD variety. The
commission ought also to facilitate the expansion of community and other
forms of ownership at the expense of private landlords. This will
involve the payment of compensation to the individual and institutional
owners of a number of estates. It will amount, in fact, to
state-financed land purchase.
This is not quite as novel a proposal as you might, on first
encountering it, imagine. The Conservative Party, for example, has
employed state-financed purchase on a rather wider front than I suggest.
It was by such means that Conservative Governments, some years prior to
Ireland becoming independent, initiated processes which culminated in
the extinction of Irish landlordism and in the consequent transfer of
the bulk of Ireland's farmland to Ireland's former tenant farmers.
The fact that modern Ireland is a land of owner-occupying farmers; the
fact that Ireland is no longer, as it once was, a country dominated by
estates belonging to absentee proprietors: these facts are due in large
part to policies devised by Tory Governments. So why deny to Scots
reforms of a type which have proved so helpful to the Irish?
It was with an eye to Irish precedent that the Crofters Commission,
back in 1968, urged Government to acquire compulsorily the million-plus
acres of privately owned land which is in crofting tenure. Crofters, the
commission argued, would greatly benefit if -- like their Irish
counterparts -- they were to be assisted to swop tenancy for
owner-occupancy.
On an ''appointed day'', the Crofters Commission continued, all land
in crofting tenure could be compulsorily acquired by the Scottish
Secretary who would then transfer ownership of such land to its
occupiers.
Each crofter was to become the outright possessor of his or her croft.
Each township's common grazing was to be vested in a local trust. And
the purchase price payable by crofters to the Scottish Secretary, who
would already have compensated crofting landlords for their loss, was to
take the form of annuities which, in accordance with earlier practice in
Ireland, were to be roughly equivalent to previous rents and were to run
for as long as it took the total purchase price to be attained.
Very little of this, of course, came to pass. The eventual legislative
consequence of those 1968 proposals was Labour's hotch-potch Crofting
Act of 1976. This Act rejected all idea of compulsion. It left the
common grazings with the landlords. And though it gave to crofters the
right to purchase inbye land, it made the exercise of purchase rights
entirely voluntary. The result is that crofters have been left with the
most dreadful shambles -- a muddled mix of tenancy and ownership which,
in my experience, is a very real impediment to all sorts of crofting
progress.
But I have little time for what was done to crofting by the Act of
1976, and for all that I prefer community ownership of the Assynt sort
to ownership of crofts by individuals, I remain greatly taken with the
mechanism which the Crofters Commission canvassed as the means of
putting its 1968 ideas into practice. My equivalent of the commission's
''appointed day'' on which all land in crofting tenure was to be taken
over by the state would be January 1, 2000. That is when there could
take effect the Land Reform Act which I should like a Scots parliament
to pass. It ought to be one of this Act's consequences that the crofting
landlord, on January 1, 2000, would pass into history.
The Crofting Act of 1976 laid down the principle that crofters are
entitled to purchase their inbye land from their landlord at prices
which are roughly equal to 15 times their annual rents. These rents --
long subject to adjudication by the Scottish Land Court -- are
invariably low. This is because the Land Court recognises that virtually
the entire value of a croft is the creation of the crofter and his or
her predecessors in the holding. The landlord, having provided nothing
but the bare land, is entitled only to a bare land rent -- which
frequently amounts to no more than #10, #20, or #30 a year.
While it may appear surprising that crofters can buy their crofts for
as little as #200 or #300 a time, this arrangement imposes no financial
penalty on landlords. When a croft rented at #30 a year is bought by its
occupier, the landlord receives #450. Bearing in mind that the landlord
no longer has any managerial overheads in respect of the croft in
question, this sum, when invested, should produce a larger net annual
return to the croft's former landlord than the landlord would have
obtained by retaining the croft in his possession.
It seems reasonable, therefore, that my projected Land Commission
should apply the 1976 purchase formula to the totality of tenanted croft
land -- including common grazings. If this were to happen, the aggregate
cost of buying out Scotland's crofting landlords would be below #10m --
equivalent in other words to a National Lottery jackpot in a fairly
average week.
This figure, I should stress, does not take account of the further
costs that would be involved in buying out the sporting and mineral
rights now attaching to crofting estates. But the fact that more than a
million acres of croft land could be got into community ownership for
less than #10m serves to underline one of my lecture's central points.
Scottish land reform will be neither so difficult nor so expensive to
implement as is often assumed or alleged.
Land use code
THE private landlord would not vanish as a consequence of my proposed
reforms. Were such reforms to take effect, however, all owners of land
would find their ownership governed by a legally enforceable land use
code.
The general notion of such a code ought to be made explicit in the new
bargain which will be struck, so to speak, when our land law is shorn of
its feudal complexities and when all proprietors of land are placed in a
direct legal relationship with the Crown or with Scotland's sovereign
people.
While neither the Crown nor the sovereign people, following such
reform, would retain any of the restrictive and oppressive rights which
feudal superiors currently exercise over their subordinate landholders,
the Crown or the sovereign people could, and should, make land ownership
conditional on owners conducting themselves in accordance with such
socially and environmentally desirable standards as may be incorporated
into a Scottish land use code by Scotland's parliament.
The introduction of a land use code, of course, could readily
depreciate land values. This would have the wholly beneficial effect of
making it easier to acquire the land needed for new rural settlements
and other innovative ventures of that type.
Certainly there should be no question of compensation being due in
respect of any land price fall resulting from the introduction of a land
use code. Landowners ought to be no more entitled to compensation in
respect of laws controlling operating practices in factories.
The main points
* Feudalism should be eradicated from our land law.
* Owners of land should be placed in something approximating to a
direct legal relationship with the Crown or with the sovereign people of
Scotland.
* Managerial responsibilities and revenue-raising powers in respect of
the coastal seabed, and in respect also of those parts of the foreshore
which are still in Crown control, should be transferred from the Crown
Estate Commissioners to coastal communities.
* State-owned crofting estates, of which there are a substantial
number, should be placed in community ownership.
* Privately owned crofting estates should be placed in community
ownership also.
* Those farming tenants who have security of tenure under the
Agricultural Holdings Acts should be legally entitled to buy their
farms.
* Either by outright sale, or by mechanisms which simply transfer
management to others, Forestry Commission plantations should be made
available to a wide range of rural residents.
* New types of settlement should be established as widely as possible
in the countryside.
* Landownership should be conditional on the observation of a legally
enforceable land use code.
* A Land Commission should be established to facilitate these and
other reforms.

Geoffrey Parkhouse reports how Malcolm Rifkind's blooding in Scotland
has stood him well in the Foreign Office.
MALCOLM Rifkind shares his knowledge and his experiences, if not his
innermost political thoughts. Back from Bosnia, at one of his 9am
team-meetings with his junior Foreign Office ministers, he was
congratulated for his coolness under fire in Sarajevo.
''Ah well,'' he responded, ''my experience is that one's reactions in
such circumstances are commensurate with one's knowledge of events.'' In
short, he hadn't realised that he was in danger and therefore had not
found himself afraid. The point about this is not the matter-of-fact
observation, but the elegance of its expression.
A Winston Churchill might have said that; a Rab Butler, or an Alec
Douglas-Home. The Rifkind brain relates to their kind of style and
intellect. Margaret Thatcher would have phrased it differently and so
would John Major.
Here is your new, bustling Foreign Secretary, successor to Douglas
Hurd, the patrician, Etonian, elder statesman to John Major. Mr Rifkind
is not obliged to hang around in armoured cars in the former Yugoslavia
writing short stories while the haggling goes on to get him through
brigands' barricades. Mr Rifkind is in and out, thrusting like a new-era
diplomat for a country which, with more than 8000 British troops on the
ground, has provided the largest up-front UN contingent.
People keep saying about him that if he wasn't so bloody brilliant and
analytical, and that if he didn't have that superior-sounding Edinburgh
lawyer's voice, he would be a dead ringer for Tory Party leadership one
day. It is too soon to judge whether he will be a great Foreign
Secretary, but it may be timely to observe that he has made another
quantum leap in personal political influence.
Any former Scottish Secretary -- Labour or Tory -- is the envy of
Westminster politicians because there is no better grounding in politics
to be had than the cauldron of Scottish politics. Rifkind's blooding in
that regard under the suspicious Margaret Thatcher was probably the
hardest and the best in living memory.
Bosnia and his relationship with Thatcher's successor, Major, seem to
be particularly pertinent to Rifkind's growing status in government.
This is often the case in government; events and the people involved
interwoven. The Prime Minister has always been more gung-ho about Bosnia
than those around him, particularly Mr Rifkind who, as Defence Secretary
until last July, was obliged to consider the safety of the troops at
risk as much from a highly nebulous political mandate as from Serb
snipers.
There had already been a personal frisson between Major and Rifkind
dating back to about 1990, although nobody quite remembers why. Perhaps
it was a hangover from the Thatcher days when she thought he was going
''native'' over devolution. In any event, Mr Rifkind was very sceptical
about committing British troops on the ground in Bosnia.
All this has changed. Mr Rifkind has changed his view about the
efficacy of firepower and, sure enough, when the new Rapid Reaction
Force, with its heavy guns that have helped to relieve Sarajevo, was
called for, he had a detailed, ready-made plan to present within 48
hours. This impressed the Prime Minister and whatever difficulties the
two men may have had in the past are now reconciled.
Even before the July reshuffle which gave Rifkind the job on Douglas
Hurd's retirement, his abilities were well established. As Foreign
Secretary he has established daily meetings of his ministers (when he is
not abroad) at which his information, assessments and intuitions are
shared freely with his juniors. They are obliged to contribute to the
discussion whether it is on their particular brief or not.
There was almost an immediate crisis when he took over at the Foriegn
Office. His first two visits to Washington were not a success. Senator
Dole, the new power-broker, avoided him and the playback from the White
House was not adulatory. Mr Major and his new Foreign Secretary felt
that American policy on Bosnia was cavalier, to put it mildly.
Mr Rifkind went there and told them in no uncertain terms that until
they had troops committed on the ground they should take a more
pragmatic and less of a morally crusading stance. Washington was told
that if Congress broke the arms embargo on the Muslims, British troops
would be out and American troops would have to go in.
The United States did not relish being ''lectured'' in these terms and
the reports came back that the Foreign Secretary had gone down badly.
But Mr Rifkind was doing the Prime Minister's bidding and the Secretary
of State Warren Christopher knew what he was about. As events turn out,
Washington and London are now running in tandem on Bosnia.
They have learned, like many before them, that Malcolm Rifkind's
analytical abilities are not to be trifled with. It may be that
Rifkind's ''lectures'' have produced the long-awaited American lead to
end the slaughter in the Balkans.

Jack Webster looks back to the night 40 years ago when the first
advert appeared on commercial TV, marking the beginning of a social
revolution and, for some, the end of civilisation as they knew it
THE current upheaval in my locality, where the streets are a nightmare
of excavation, is a warning that we are about to be invaded by the
wonders of cable television, with its eventual capacity for hundreds of
stations and all the facilities which will be commonplace in the century
ahead.
It is a far cry from that moment, 40 years ago tonight, when the great
British public -- or at least that part of it in the South-east of
England -- faced up to its very first taste of commercial television.
It was two years later, in August 1957, before Scottish Television
brought the new phenomenon north of the Border.
But on today's date of 1955, at precisely 9.01pm, television
advertising cut its first tooth with, appropriately, a 70-second slot
for Gibbs SR toothpaste (''It's tingling fresh. It's fresh as ice'').
In that year, when first we heard the rock'n'roll of Elvis Presley and
Bill Haley, this intrusion into the sacred territory of the British
Broadcasting Corporation was certainly part of a watershed in the whole
social history of the nation.
The elderly Winston Churchill had backed the idea, and the
Postmaster-General, Dr Charles Hill, assured us that Hamlet would not be
pausing in his soliloquy to tell us what toothpaste they were using at
Elsinore.
But that did not prevent an avalanche of opposition and doubt,
expressed at the highest level.
The great historian, A J P Taylor, said: ''The ending of the BBC
monopoly is the biggest knock which respectability has taken in my
lifetime.''
Lord Esher declared it as ''a planned and premeditated orgy of
vulgarity''. And the formidable Lord Reith, founding boss of the BBC but
by then in the House of Lords, compared the proposed Independent
Television to ''smallpox, bubonic plague, and the Black Death -- a
maggot in the body politic of England''.
But the dreaded abomination came in spite of all, and has expanded to
become a major part of the commercialism which now dominates our lives.
Area by area, the franchise spread till it covered the nation. The
Canadian Roy Thomson gained his much-quoted ''licence to print money''
with STV in 1957, the opening programme beaming into 187,000 homes to be
watched by 750,000 people.
But how did the advertising world face up to the new challenge,
unaccustomed as it was to this new animal which belonged to the
blatantly capitalist land of America?
Winston Fletcher, advertising guru and respected author on the
subject, told me: ''There was nobody with any experience, nothing to
fall back on. Advertising people knew only about posters and press ads
and, initially, they tried to turn those press ads into commercials.
''That very first one for Gibbs SR toothpaste was an example. It was
still, with very little action.
''Then they developed the jingle and cartoon, like Murray mint, Murray
mint, too good to hurry mint, and were just learning to use the
cinematic medium in the highly compressed form necessary for a 30-second
message.''
It was not until the 1970s that they really began to master the art,
with commercials like Levi's, which just hinted at the message and used
film very cinematically.
Winston Fletcher casts more light on how those early commercials were
made: ''At first, the people who wrote them were just that -- writers,
whose experience was literary, and the message tended to be more by
words than images.
''In those early days, both advertisers and the public believed that
interruption to programmes would be unwelcome, unlike the United States,
where the commercial had always been part of the mix.
''So to sweeten the pill the British commercial tried to be likeable
and amusing, in the hope it would overcome audience antipathy. That set
up a tradition we still enjoy today, in which British television
advertising is among the wittiest and most amusing in the world, far
more so than in the United States.''
Meanwhile, faced with British television for the first time, the
American advertisers thought the consumer would not readily digest and
understand the commercial message. The resulting contrast was that they
produced those monstrosities of horrifying simplicity, side-by-side
demonstrations of the product that worked and the one that didn't.
We have come a long way since those early days, even though they did
include such engaging personalities as Sir Compton Mackenzie telling us
about the joys of Horlicks and Laurence Olivier publicising Polaroid.
Leading film directors like Ken Russell, Ridley Scott, and David
Puttnam have lent their talents to television commercials. Classical
music has found a role in the market-place though, on a personal note,
the vulgarising of Dvorak's New World Symphony so angered me that I have
shunned that particular brand of bread ever since!
The modern picture is that 4500 television commercials are made every
year. The average 35-year-old is estimated to have seen 150,000, most of
them at least six times. The experts tell us that a four-year-old child
is now capable of differentiating between a programme and a commercial.
Some hint of the extent of it all comes from the plain fact that
advertisers, in the past year, have spent #2.8 billion on television.
The future seems less certain. With new channels in the pipeline and a
bewildering prospect of cable, satellite, and goodness knows what, the
available revenue will be going in many more directions.
Life was certainly simpler when we all watched the same channel and
our habits were not shaped by the insidious effect of television's
commercial power.
But it all changed 40 years ago tonight, a milestone on the path of
progress which has surely played a major part, for better or worse, in
producing the kind of society we know today.

The reappearance of former MP George Reid at this year's SNP
conference will have taken many by surprise, but it is likely to have
been long-planned. Jennifer Cunningham recounts his life and times.
HE was young, personable, had local roots, and the bonus of having
popped up on the television screen, but none of the political
commentators expected him to overturn a Labour majority of 10,000.
When George Reid did just that 21 years ago to take Clackmannan and
East Stirling from Dick Douglas, the Scottish media claimed the new SNP
MP was as surprised as anyone. It wasn't true. It may have been his
first hustings, but the campaign was strategically planned, exhaustively
monitored and perfectly executed by someone who had analysed as a
journalist the differences between successful and unsuccessful
candidates. His success in 1974 was due overwhelmingly to hard work.
There was a razzmatazz about the campaign which was novel in those
days, old party activists were reinvigorated and young people from the
sleepy towns and villages of the Hillfoots were drawn as if to a
travelling fair. All that, however, was a smokescreen for relentless
backroom analysis, private polls, and solid doorstepping. Too late,
Labour realised what was happening. Dick Douglas's army fought back, but
by polling day everyone who had watched the campaigns knew it was
possible for the SNP to win. It is significant that Douglas himself is
now on the SNP.
It was not such a surprise to those who had seen Reid in action
before. A contemporary at St Andrews University, where he had been
President of the Students Representative Council, a prominent debater,
and student journalist, before collecting the university prize and a
first class Honours degree in history, recalls him as someone who did
not do things by halves: very bright, very hard-working and ambitious.
Born in Tullibody, just outside Alloa, in 1939, he was educated at
Dollar Academy and after St Andrews studied Russian and politics in the
United States before winning a Ford Foundation grant to work in the
Senate and House of Representatives. He was a journalist on the Scottish
Daily Express in the early 60s before moving into television as
reporter, producer, becoming Head of News and Current Affairs at STV.
As an MP, he made full use of all the skills and experience of his
journalistic career. He attended local events almost religiously, was
terrier-like in pursuing constituents' problems, alerting the local
media if it would help his cause. No-one in Clackmannan and East
Stirling could fail to know who their MP was. All the time, though,
there were wider issues and a much bigger agenda. Even then, when it was
not fashionable, though not yet politically incorrect, he described
himself as a social democrat. His main cause was always social justice
and it seemed that independence was the means to that end rather than an
end in itself.
It is not clear, even now, how far that line was adopted as a matter
of political expediency, but from his maiden speech in the House of
Commons he used the term assembly where others might have said
parliament and rarely talked on independence per se. ''While we will
attempt to achieve what we can within this House, we obviously believe
we can achieve even greater benefits for our people given a Scottish
assembly with fiscal powers. That is the heart of the matter,'' he said
before commending a proposal for devolution by Jim Sillars, then a
Labour MP.
In the archaeology of SNP sloganising, this was the age of ''It's
Scotland's Oil''. By the time the hung Parliament brought about a second
General Election in October, the fight between the SNP and Labour
supporters in an otherwise douce constituency had turned vicious. The
anti-English race card was played in Dollar and attempts to pour oil on
troubled waters made things worse. That made hard-line independence a
two-edged sword in a constituency with a hungry radical tendency and a
historical sympathy with the home rule cause but also a large floating
vote. In other matters he was equally unafraid to stray from the party
furrow, once being disciplined for attending a European meeting.
Assiduous constituency work and a general swing to the SNP throughout
the country meant Reid held the seat and the party sent 11 MPs to
Westminster. When the football team was reduced to two in 1979, he was
one of the casualties, losing to Labour's new man, Martin O'Neill.
He returned to television, becoming presenter of the BBC's Current
Account programme.
It was clearly a tame and frustrating job after the wider horizons of
national politics, in which he had already moved into some international
areas, such as the revitalised Western European Union. The move to
Geneva in 1984 as head of Information for the International League of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies had an inevitability about it. His
political opponents, some of whom had previously talked of him as a
future Chancellor of a Scottish Exchequer, expected to hear more of him
but only from afar.
His reappearance at this year's SNP conference will have taken many of
them by surprise, but it is likely to have been long-planned.
''Our long-term aim has always been to return home to Scotland, but
with kids at a French/English language school, we had to make sure they
finished first, '' he said. After three contracts with the International
Red Cross (during which he was awarded the Pirogov Gold Medal for his
work in the Armenian earthquake), he is now a self-employed consultant
working for international organisations including the Red Cross and the
UN. A major project for the UN involves the first organised
collaboration of commercial, UN, and non-governmental relief agencies.
He's in the process of working out the technicalities of continuing that
from Bridge of Allan.
In Perth yesterday, he described himself as a canny radical. For canny
add the old Scots gloss of wily to the gradualism he has always
espoused. Beware. This is a political animal.

POLICE are waiting for tests to explain what caused the death of
schoolboy Martin Lynes, whose body was found in a newspaper recycling
skip.
The body of the 13-year-old, who disappeared from his home in
Leatherhead, Surrey, on Sunday, was uninjured and there was nothing
other than paper in the skip, a police spokesman said.
''There are no suspicious circumstances. We're not looking for anyone
in connection with his death,'' he added.
Police believe Martin died of natural causes but the spokesman said it
would take two or three days for tests to be completed and the
pathologist to make his report.
Martin's body was found as the skip was being emptied at Beddington, a
few miles from his home, and was identified formally yesterday.
Police believe Martin had made a den or a hideaway in the skip, which
was half-a-mile from his home in Cleeve Road, Leatherhead.
''He had this habit of building play dens. He was young for his age,''
the spokesman said.
He said the post-mortem examination indicated that Martin was already
dead when the skip was moved from its site in Station Road on Wednesday
evening.
Martin, who had speech difficulties, was last seen on Sunday.
''We don't know why he didn't go back home. There was no reason for
him to leave home, no signs of problems,'' the spokesman said.

A FISHING-BOAT skipper was fined #31,500 yesterday at Stornoway
Sheriff Court.
Alexander Davidson, 46, who skippers the Dean, a Spanish owned
Ayr-registered boat, admitted breaking his quota for monk fish and
falsifying his log book.
The court heard that he had more than 11 tonnes of monk fish on board
when his licence permitted him to have only two tonnes.
Davidson, of Aparcadero, Arteixo, La Coruna, Spain, admitted
committing the offences on September 18 when fishing about 80 miles
south of St Kilda.
He also admitted furnishing false information in the log book, showing
he had only 7.4 tonnes of monk fish when he had more than 11 tonnes.
Procurator-fiscal Mrs Deborah Wilson, prosecuting, said that when
fishery officers boarded the vessel they realised that the quota had
been broken.
The skipper was cautioned that he was well in excess of the permitted
amount of fish but continued to haul in his gill net which was about
five miles long. The vessel was then escorted into Stornoway where the
fish were weighed and it was estimated that there were more than 11
tonnes.
Sheriff Principal Douglas J Risk was told there were three skippers on
board, a Spanish fishing skipper, a Spanish navigation skipper, and a
British fishing skipper.
Mrs Wilson said: ''The Crown is well aware that people in Mr
Davidson's position have to do what they are told. Nevertheless, he is
the one who is required to keep the log book in accordance with the
regulations which are written in plain English. He did not have a lot of
choice as to what he entered.''
She said the maximum fine was #50,000 and the value of the monk fish
on board was #17,500. She asked for forfeiture of the fish rather than
have an additional fine imposed not exceeding the value of the fish.
The gill net was valued at #3000. On the second charge, the maximum
penalty was also #50,000.
Sheriff Principal Risk said: ''This is a particularly bad example of
exceeding a fishing quota. Falsifying the entries in the log book might
affect future quotas.''
He imposed a fine of #12,000 on the first charge, #2000 on the second,
and also ordered forfeiture of the monk fish which were valued at
#17,500.
Arrangements were being made after the court for the company to pay
the fines. Meanwhile, the fish are in cold storage.

Cool, calm, and collected. . . the class of 94 give their verdict on
the pupil of 32.
WE were motivated to write this article following the intense media
coverage of the case relating to our friend Brian MacKinnon, also known
as Brandon Lee. As friends, we feel that some of this coverage has been
unfair to Brian and suggests aspects of his character which, in our
considerable experience, are unfounded.
Although we are aware that Brian has misled numerous people and agree
that what he has done is wrong, he has never done any real harm. We were
Brian's friends before these events and will remain so.
We had strong suspicions about Brian's true age and identity for
several months. We heard rumours about him around New Year -- not
through school, where no-one knew the truth -- but we felt no compulsion
to pursue the issue because it did not matter to us.
We did not even talk about it among ourselves, so we saw no reason to
raise it with him. It was our friendship that mattered, not his age, or
true identity.
At the time, we were not looking ahead at all. We lived our lives as
the days went by. We were not planning the future. We were surprised
that it was such a big deal when the story came out. We were annoyed
about the leak and about whoever was responsible for it.
Although Brian left school at the end of fifth year we kept in regular
contact with him. When he was at Dundee University, we saw him sometimes
at weekends. After he left, we saw him more often.
We would like to make it clear to the public that a great many of
those who have spoken to the media regarding Brian's character hardly
knew him and were motivated by the potential for personal gain.
We feel that there are several specific allegations which ought to be
put right. Firstly, the Brian MacKinnon that we know is anything but a
loner. On the contrary, he fitted into several social groups with ease,
taking part in school activities such as the school show, the student
council, and the debating society.
He would regularly join us for activities such as parties, visits to
the cinema, and so on. He was often the centre of attention within our
group owing to his sharp wit and funny anecdotes. He could contribute to
any conversation. He is a humorous guy.
There have been many comments claiming he made persistent advances
towards girls in the school. Quite simply, this is not true. He was
happy to mix with both sexes on a purely platonic level. For others to
suggest otherwise is malicious and insulting.
During our time with Brian, on no occasion did he exhibit any signs of
mental instability. Indeed, our friend never lost his temper with any of
us and always appeared to be cool, calm, and collected.
All six of us, and many others who unfortunately could not join us
today, share the same view of Brian. He was one of the most kind,
considerate, thoughtful, and caring individuals we have ever had the
pleasure of meeting. Brian was never heard saying a bad word against
anyone -- unfortunately he has not been treated with the same
consideration and respect.
The majority of the tabloid press has invaded our privacy for the past
four days. These papers have twisted, stretched, and exaggerated the
truth, not to mention indulged in fabrication when the truth was not
juicy enough to sell their so-called newspapers.
Furthermore, they have hounded Brian's 70-year-old mother, who has
become a prisoner in her own home. In general, the reporters' and
photographers' behaviour has been a disgrace.
We would like to finish by saying that Brian is one of our closest
friends and we would like him to know that he has our support. If you
are reading this, Brian, thanks for your friendship, which we hope will
continue. We are here for you if you need us and wish you all the best
for the future. Good luck.
Your close friends,
Emma Barclay, Neil McFarlane, Louise Orr, Ian Osborne, Lynn
Sivewright, and Nicola Walker.
PS: Thanks to our headteacher Norman McLeod, Mrs May MacKinnon, and
Barclay McBain.

A FIRST World War shell has been discovered in the basement of a West

It was later successfully destroyed by an Army bomb disposal squad in
a nearby quarry area, Lothian Region Education Department confirmed
yesterday.
The shell was found below the primary one classroom on Tuesday by the
janitor of Kirknewton Primary School, Mr Brian Laidlaw.
He called the police, who in turn called in 521 Explosive Ordnance
Disposal Squadron from Army HQ Scotland.
By coincidence, the school's 180 pupils had been allowed home for the
day because of an in-service training course for teachers, the education
spokesman added.
Mr Laidlaw, 50, said he was about to toss the lump of rusting metal
into a dustbin when he realised he had a bomb in his hands.
''You could have knocked me down with a feather when I was told it was
live,'' he added.
''To think that it could have gone off at any time is frightening,
especially when you think of the thousands of children who have sat in
classrooms above it for almost 80 years.''
The Army reported that the shell, dated 1916 and not actually
containing explosives powder, was so badly corroded that the fuse could
not be made safe.

TWO teenage brothers have been accused of murdering teacher Evelyn
Howells.
The boys, aged 14 and 15, will appear at Huddersfield Youth Court
today.
The body of mother-of-two Mrs Howells, 48, was found at her home in
Dalton Green Lane, Dalton, Huddersfield, on August 31.
She had allegedly been bludgeoned with a hammer and died from head
injuries.
Her bloodstained body was found on the living room sofa by her son
Glenn on his return from walking the family's pet dog.
Glenn then stopped his younger brother John from going into the house,
it emerged.
Despite an intensive search of nearby woods and streams by police, the
weapon used to kill Mrs Howells has not been found.
Detective Superintendent Gary Haigh said the house had been entered
through the unlocked back door and #100 stolen from the kitchen.

ELDERLY and vulnerable people will be at risk unless a full inquiry is
launched into the future of the welfare state, a social services chief
warned yesterday.
Mr Tad Kubisa, president of the Association of Directors of Social
Services, said a Royal Commission was needed to examine changes in
welfare needs.
Policies linked to unemployment, housing, education, and the role of
social services should be scrutinized.
Unless this was carried out there was a danger that the welfare state
would ''wither on the vine''.
Speaking at the annual social services conference in Bournemouth, he
said: ''The demographers of the 1940s did not predict the impact of the
growing number of very elderly who are now making demands for income
support and health, housing, and care services.
''It is an irony that the very success of the NHS and public health
policies has triggered the demographic time-bomb which is confronting us
now, and is in danger of breaking the system.
''What we require is another Beveridge if we are to avoid putting our
most disadvantaged at risk and thereby condemning them to a miserable
old age.''
In a wide-ranging presidential speech, Mr Kubisa attacked the current
approach to these issues as fragmented, disjointed, and incremental.
He said social services bore a particular strain and were now having
to shoulder the financial burden of services previously provided by
other agencies.
These included:
* Caring for 16 and 17-year-olds because of cuts to income support;
* Cuts in the education welfare service and probation services aimed
at young people;
* Voluntary groups charging social services the full cost of providing
services;
He went on: ''It is clear that social services are now funding a
substantial proportion of services which were once provided by other
major social policy agencies.
''It is hardly surprising that at times we are unable to meet all our
obligations. You cannot get a pint out of a half-pint pot.''
Mr Kubisa said the endless process of redefining and withdrawing
services by the agencies was no longer acceptable and was ultimately
wasteful. If decisions were made to charge for services that were once
provided free, that had to be taken following consultation.
''These are matters for all citizens and not just the province of
politicians, professionals, managers, and administrators,'' he said.
''If we need to redefine access to health, wealth, income support,
education, and housing then let us do it openly and honestly. We will
all fail those in greatest need if we are not prepared to address these
issues at this time.''
He concluded that unless action was taken, there was a danger of
social services becoming a residual low-key agency -- much as it was
before the creation of the welfare state.
Britain would end up having US-style poverty ghettos if this was
allowed to happen.

BRITAIN'S largest independent football tour operator has clashed with
Rangers over an unofficial trip to the European Champions' League match
against Juventus in Italy.
Universal Tours, based in Cheshire,
claims it has 350 tickets for a section of the Stadio Dell Alpi in
Turin. The tickets are not for the official Rangers section of the
ground but the travel firm says it is merely providing a cheap service
for football fans who cannot afford an official club trip.
The managing director of Universal, Mr John Cunningham, said: ''We
will liaise with the Turin police and the fans will almost certainly get
escorted to and from the games.''
Rangers' security officer Alistair Hood said: ''Dixons Travel and
Parks Coaches of Hamilton are the official agencies taking care of our
trip and they are authorised from Rangers. Any fan wishing to travel
must go through Rangers.''

TAIWAN braced itself today for what could be its most damaging typhoon
in nine years, ordering government offices, financial markets, schools
and several train links to shut down tomorrow.
The Central Weather Bureau issued a general land typhoon warning and
said Typhoon Ryan, packing winds of up to 120 mph, would probably strike
by dawn tomorrow.
Rescue teams prepared for action, and almost all local authorities
across this island of 21 million people announced that offices will be
closed tomorrow.
State radio said the city government of the capital Taipei had ordered
a closure of offices, meaning that financial markets and government
ministries will not operate.--Reuter.

Ulan Bator, Thursday,
A MONGOLIAN Airlines plane crashed into the Mountain Where Wolves Give
Birth on a domestic flight today and only one of an estimated 41 to 42
people on board survived, officials said.
The wreckage of the Russian-built Antonov-24 was found about 12 miles
from the town of Moeron after it had taken off on a flight from the
capital, Ulan Bator, officials said by telephone from Moeron.
''Up to now the number of dead is 41 to 42,'' Deputy Prime Minister
Choijilsurengiin Purevdorj, who heads a special commission investigating
the accident, told Reuters from Moeron.
''There is only one survivor, and he is in very critical condition,''
he said.
Flight 10103 crashed into the side of Choho Goelogloh Uul, or the
Mountain Where Wolves Give Birth, at 12.30pm (0530 GMT).
''We don't know the reason yet,'' said Purevdorj, who flew to Moeron
after the government set up the special commission.
Purevdorj said he would visit the crash site tomorrow.
State television said officials were sending emergency medical aid to
Moeron, about 330 miles northwest of Ulan Bator.
Prime Minister Puntsagiin Jasrai sent a telegram of condolence to the
families, the television said.
Mongolia's last major plane crash was in April, 1993, when another
twin-propeller Antonov-24 crashed into a remote mountainside on a
scheduled flight from Ulan Bator to the westernmost province of
Bayan-olgiy.
All 36 people on board were killed.
In 1990, an Antonov-24 crashed in Sukhbaatar province, killing all 30
on board.
Planes in Mongolia are often overloaded, with extra passengers --
called ''rabbits'' -- bribing their way on board without tickets. The
planes often carry heavy cargoes.
Shortages of spare parts are among other problems plaguing Mongolia's
dilapidated air transport sector.--Reuter.

Nairobi
AID officials said today they expected 14 foreigners detained by
Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed to be freed and flown to Kenya
tomorrow.
The 14 are in the southwest Somali city of Baidoa and said by radio
they were in good health and optimistic arrangements to secure their
release were progressing as planned, an official told Reuters.
Baidoa is about two hours flying time from Nairobi.
Seven women aid workers freed and flown out of Baidoa yesterday
declined to say if their agencies had made a deal with Aideed to win the
release of the 21 foreigners held since Sunday.
The foreigners were detained when Aideed's forces thrust out of
Mogadishu and seized Baidoa, known as ''the City of Death'' when it was
the centre of Somalia's 1992 famine, fuelled by civil war.
Those to be released comprised three Sudanese, two Americans, two
French, an Australian, a Rwandan, an Ethiopian, an Afghan, an Egyptian,
a Kenyan and a Tanzanian.--Reuter.

Ankara
TURKISH Prime Minister Tansu Ciller today asked by President Suleyman
Demirel to form a new government, the day after the collapse of her
left-right coalition, Ciller's office said.
''The president asked her to form a new government,'' an official from
Ciller's office told Reuters. ''She has changed her plans for a trip and
will stay in Ankara tomorrow to meet other party leaders to focus on
forming a government.''
Ciller had remained as caretaker prime minister following her
resignation yesterday after a rift over domestic security issues with
the social democrats, under their new leader Deniz Baykal, ending the
wobbly coalition between them and her conservative True Path Party
(DYP).
Main opposition Motherland Party (Anap) leader Mesut Yilmaz today
virtually ruled out forming a lasting coalition with 49-year-old Ciller.
He told private ATV television that he would only consider taking part
in a coalition if early elections were called ahead of the next
scheduled polls in October 1996.
''Turkey has now entered a de facto election process . . . and it
needs an election at the earliest date possible,'' he said. ''An
Anap-DYP government until normal election time is the least likely
possibility -- virtually zero percent.''
Ciller said earlier that early elections would be a mistake and vowed
to press on with her own policy agenda.
''Turkey has issues that cannot be put off,'' she said, in a televised
speech shortly before her nomination by Demirel. ''To ignore all these
problems and drop Turkey into the chaos of early elections would be a
dreadful mistake.''
Ciller vowed to stick with the key goals of her 27 months in power --
customs union with Europe, a Turkey-bound Caspian oil pipeline,
privatisation and democracy reforms.
''The linking to the world through our country of oil pipelines from
the Turkic republics . . . is the most important issue on our agenda in
the coming weeks and months,'' she said.
''Swift steps must be taken to take our democracy further forward,''
she said. '' . . . By the end of the year, the necessary harmonisation
decrees and laws must all be accomplished. These cannot be made to
wait.''
She said it would be a mistake to call elections just as Turkey was
about to get ''results'' in its fight with an 11-year rebel Kurd
insurgency in the southeast.
Baykal told Reuters that Turkey should have early elections quickly,
saying a delay would only increase the country's problems.
Ciller said that Turkey's economy was not ready for an election
campaign, which she said would cancel out any effects of her 1994
austerity campaign, brought in to quell a fiscal crisis.
If she gets nowhere with Anap, Ciller could forego a coalition and try
to rule in a minority government with the support of a small far-right
party.

Police told Reuters the number of wounded in the Buca prison was

Washington,
THE O J Simpson trial is coming to its climax. Judge Lance Ito hopes
that the defence will rest its case this week and that closing arguments
can begin on Tuesday -- and the jury can begin its deliberations by the
end of next week.
The long weekend is to conform to Rosh Hasanah on Monday. The defence
threw the poor judge a bone today, deciding not to call back a witness
they spent much of yesterday arguing that they wanted to call.
Then the California High Court ruled in favour of the prosecution on
the question of what the judge could say to the jury on the matter of
Mark Fuhrman, the racist and possibly perjured policeman who was reduced
to taking the Fifth Amendment and declining to answer questions for fear
of incriminating himself.
That will speed things up.
Fuhrman was the detective who found the pair of gloves, one at the
murder site, one at Simpson's house. There was blood from the victims
and from Simpson on both of them, and the prosecution has provided
strong circumstantial evidence that they belonged to the defendant.
The defence hoped to show that Fuhrman was a racist who therefore
might have planted the gloves to incriminate Simpson.
That theory would not explain how the blood got there, but might lead
the jury to suspect that the whole case against the defendant was a
racist police plot.
Fuhrman testified that he had not used the word ''nigger'' in the past
decade. That was proved to be a lie, and the detective took the fifth,
out of the jury's hearing, to avoid further charges of perjury. The
appeals courts have ruled that the judge may not refer to the matter
when he sums up for the jury.
The 12 jurors and two remaining alternates have been sequestered in a
motel, kept away from their families, protected form television and
newspapers, since last January. They are on the verge of mutiny, and if
the case is delayed much longer, they may refuse to serve any longer.
They might even challenge a judge's right to confine them to a Holiday
Inn: it is not at all clear that he has any constitutional authority to
do any such thing.

Moscow
A RUSSIAN power station came close to sparking a nuclear accident
today when it pulled the plug on a nuclear submarine base which had not
paid its bills.
Power was cut off to the Northern Fleet's base near Murmansk, where
decommissioned submarines with working nuclear reactors are berthed
waiting to be scrapped.
The vessels' on-board generators failed to start, leaving the reactors
without power for their cooling systems and at risk of suffering a
meltdown.
The military persuaded the power company to restore supplies in time
to prevent a serious accident, the Tass news agency said.
The Northern Fleet, like other Russian military units, owes billions
of roubles in unpaid electricity bills. Last week power was cut off to a
strategic missile test site at Plesetsk, also in the Russian far north.
Environmental adviser Alexei Yablokov told a German television
programme on Monday that many decommissioned Rus sian submarines were
''floating Chernobyls'' which could explode. Reuter

AT least eight people were killed and 14 wounded today as a strike
called by the ethnic Mohajir National Movement (MQM) paralysed the
Pakistani port city of Karachi, police and doctors said.
The dead included a 10-year-old girl and a woman. Among the wounded
were three plainclothes policemen hit by mistake by police fire, a
police spokesman said.
The body of a 25-year-old man with his throat slit was found in a sack
and another body was found with bullet head wounds.
The opposition MQM called the strike in the southern province of
Sindh, of which Karachi is the capital, to protest at what it sees as
repression by security forces.

New Delhi
CROWDS swamped temples across India and neighbouring Nepal today after
reports that idols of Hindu gods were drinking milk poured as sacred
offerings.
Hindus packed temples as news spread that milk offered to ''lingams''
(phallic symbols) of Lord Shiva, or idols of Ganesha, the
elephant-headed deity, disappeared.
Rationalists protested. ''Many people who believe in this kind of
thing, they look for some miracle and not want to put a critical mind on
that,'' said Sanal Edamarukku, general secreary of the Indian
Rationalist Association.
But believers, including some converted by what they were sure they
saw, far outnumbered them. Thousands left work or took leave to join
long queues at temples offering milk in spoons, kept near the tusks of
marble Ganesha idols.
The Hindu nationalist state government in Delhi said scientists would
be called in to investigate and increased the city's milk supplies by
100,000 litres as it ran short, pushing up prices.
There were long queues at temples in Delhi and Kathmandu as people
flocked to see Ganesha, who according to mythology, is Shiva's son.
Witnesses said milk was offered in spoons to idols of Shiva, either as
statues of the god in human form with a serpent around his neck or as
''lingams''.
''I have been here since 8am and watched 300 litres of milk poured,
but look below, can you see that much?,'' asked Bhagwan Meena at a Shiva
temple in Delhi's diplomatic enclave.
''I have seen Shiva drinking milk in another temple,'' said M S
Mewati, who brought his mother to the temple. ''I did not believe it
until I saw it.''
Milk is offered to Shiva by religious Hindus, and is traditionally
linked to the snake, a mystical symbol of hidden energies.
There was no reason cited for the sudden interest in the offering of
the milk, although the 12th day of a lunar fortnight -- which today was
-- is sacred to Shiva.--Reuter.
Hundreds have been queuing at a Hindu temple in west London hoping to
witness one of the statues drinking milk. A priest at the Vishwa Temple
in Southall first reported seeing the statues drinking milk, and as word
spread, around 500 people besieged the temple, many carrying bottles of
milk. Roshan Lal Bhanbari, temple chairman, said he heard the same thing
is happening in New York. ''I believe that some great soul has descended
on earth, just like Lord Krishna, Lord Rama or Christ.''

Moscow
RUSSIAN commandos stormed a hijacked bus today, freeing 18 hostages
and arresting two gunmen in a lightning raid that redeemed the battered
reputation of counter-terrorism troops.
Heavily-armed special forces in camouflage uniforms smashed into the
vehicle's doors and windows in southern Russia ending an overnight
crisis within seconds.
They led out two blood-splashed hijackers as civilian captives
scrambled to safety.
Officials said no-one was seriously hurt -- in contrast to the deaths
of scores in a botched raid three months ago aimed at releasing civilian
hostages.
The raid was launched after the gunmen released three women and two
children in exchange for a ransom of #1m brought by helicopter.
Russian Television showed pictures of the operation in Makhachkala,
capital of the North Caucasus region of Dagestan which borders rebel
Chechnya.
An armoured personnel carrier parked on one side of the bus distracted
the two hijackers and officers in full riot gear broke into it from the
other side.
Seconds later two hijackers, their faces covered with blood, were
lying face down on the asphalt, each saddled by at least three security
officials, holding their arms and legs.
''I am a hostage, I am a hostage,'' screamed a third man, blood
dripping from his face, as police dragged him away.
Russian news agencies said all hostages -- nine men, seven women and
two children -- held in the bus since last night, were released and none
was seriously injured.
The seizure of the bus was the latest of a series of hijackings in the
volatile Caucasus region.
Itar-Tass news agency said the bus was seized after police detained
two men with large bags as they were about to board it.
''They were taken to a special room to be searched. During the search
one of them snatched a Kalashnikov assault rifle from his bag and
ordered the policemen to lie down on the floor,'' the agency said.
The gunmen then ran towards the bus, leaving behind a bag which Tass
said contained a grenade, a pistol and two masks.
They released one woman to tell the authorities their demands -- #1m
they said they needed to pay to treat their friends for drug addiction
and a getaway helicopter.
Local officials started negotiations, while crack units prepared the
attack.
It was the first big hostage-taking in southern Russia since June,
when Chechen rebels led by field commander Shamil Basayev seized several
hundred people in the town of Budennovsk.
More than 120 people were killed in the southern town, some by rebels
and others in a botched attempt by Russian forces to storm the hospital
where the hostages were being held.
President Boris Yeltsin created a new anti-terrorist centre in
response to the raid.
The hostage-taking in Makhachkala took place hours after an apparent
assassination attempt in Chechnya against Oleg Lobov, Yeltsin's special
envoy in the war-torn region.
* Russian and Chechen peace negotiators agreed today to keep talking
to each other after a series of explosions and menacing statements by
both sides risked reigniting war.

Washington, Thursday
WITH the Gulf War raging, Iraqi scientists struggled to make small
nuclear warheads that could be carried on missiles or warplanes, top
Iraqi defector General Hussein Kamel Hassan claimed today.
His latest revelation about the regime of his father-in-law Saddam
Hussein came when he was asked if Iraqi scientists had been ordered ''to
deliver some kind of nuclear device at the time of the Gulf War''.
He said: ''Our first design was for 12 tonnes then it went down to six
tonnes; then we wanted a small bomb with a 500 kg (1100lb) warhead or
even 300 kg (660lb) so it could be easily carried by missiles or
warplanes.''
''Iraq was working very quickly on this. We wanted the missiles to
carry the nuclear weapons.''
But, he added: ''That's all in the past. Now Iraq is not going to
repeat that.''
The general, mastermind of Iraq's military and civilian industries,
and his brother Saddam Kamel, fled to Jordan on August 8 with their
wives, who are both Saddam Hussein's daughters.
He said he fled because he opposed government policy. Iraq said he
fled with #24m.
Meanwhile, famine threatens four million people in sanctions-hit Iraq
-- one fifth of the population -- following a poor grain harvest, UN
experts say.
''The human situation is deteriorating. Living conditions are
precarious and are at pre-famine level for at least four million
people,'' said a report based on a visit to Iraq in July and August by a
UN Crop and Nutrition Status Assessment Mission.
According to the report, part of which was made available to Reuters,
this year's cereal harvest reached 2.2 million tonnes.
''The cereal production for 1994/1995 was 10% lower than last year and
about 16% lower than the average of the previous five years,'' according
to Yusuf Abdilleh, assistant Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
representative in Iraq.
Iraq needed 2.3 million more tonnes of grain to meet the needs of its
20 million people, said the report.

New Delhi, Thursday,
INDIA expects a ''happy ending'' to an 11-week-old hostage ordeal in
Kashmir because separatist guerrillas holding four Westerners have
already achieved two of their three objectives, an official said today.
A spokesman for the government of the state of Jammu and Kashmir said
Al-Faran militants might release the captive tourists when they realise
they have reached some of their goals without winning the release of
jailed separatists.
''We are looking for an opening and we feel there will be a happy
ending,'' the spokesman, who asked not to be identified, told the
Foreign Correspondents' Club of South Asia.
He said the government had made it clear to Al-Faran it did not intend
to swap jailed militants for American Donald Hutchings, German Dirk
Hasert and Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, abducted in southern
Kashmir in early July.
''But they could have more than one objective,'' said the official.
''When they see some of their objectives have been achieved, they might
ask, 'Why hold on to them?'''
The official said Al-Faran, in addition to trying to win the release
of 15 jailed militants including three Pakistanis, appeared to want to
reverse a trend towards the return of normalcy in the Himalayan state by
discouraging tourism.
''This objective, I think, has been served,'' he said, noting that
some foreign governments had issued advisories to their nationals to
avoid the region.
The guerrilla group, unknown before the kidnappings, has also
succeeded in projecting the bloody five-year-old separatist conflict in
largely Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state onto newspapers across
the world, he said.
''Having achieved these two objectives, I think we have reached the
stage where things could become counter-productive,'' he said. ''We hope
that whoever has organised this will decide enough is enough and say,
'Let's release them.'''
Authorities in Jammu and Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar, said
there had been no contact with Al-Faran yesterday, marking the first
break in daily talks since last week.
But they said such interruptions had occurred many times before and
were confident the hostages were unharmed.
Newspapers recently reported that militants were close to striking a
deal with authorities involving a cash ransom variously estimated at
$750,000 to $50m.
''I wouldn't like to react to that at all,'' the state government
spokesman said. ''When you are talking, you are talking about various
things.''
Asked if the government had ruled out the possibility that, as part of
a deal, some militants would be released from jail after the hostages
were freed, he said the government had ruled out a direct swap of
militants for the captives.
But it was up to the judiciary to decide the fate of jailed militants.
''This will depend on our courts,'' he said.
The official said the government would consider providing Al-Faran
militants with safe passage to another nation if they released the
hostages unharmed, even though the guerrillas beheaded a fifth hostage,
Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe.--Reuter.

Taba, Egypt
ISRAEL and the PLO missed another target date today for signing an
accord on wider Palestinian self-rule, but said they were closer to
resolving the main dispute blocking an agreement.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
spent more than five hours discussing the fate of Hebron, the only Arab
West Bank city with a Jewish settler population.
Later, top PLO negotiator Ahmed Korei said: ''Talks are still very
difficult and gaps are still wide on some issues but I think we have an
agreement on the concept of redeployment from Hebron.''
He told Reuters the two sides hoped to conclude an agreement by next
week.
Palestinians want Israel to withdraw its troops from most of Hebron
when soldiers redeploy out of other West Bank cities to allow wider
Palestinian self-rule, now limited to Gaza and Jericho.
But Israel, concerned for the safety of around 400 Jewish settlers,
wants to maintain control of security in parts of the Hebon holy to both
Muslims and Jews.

Rome, Thursday,
THE corruption trial of Italy's fashion elite, including Giorgio
Armani, Gianfranco Ferre and Krizia, has been adjourned until November
27.
Court sources said the trial was put back on procedural grounds after
a defending lawyer fell ill and because of problems arising from a
crowded court agenda.
None of the defendants, accused of bribing tax officers in exchange
for lenient audits, was present at the trial opening in Milan.
Other designers on trial include Santo Versace, brother of fashion ace
Gianni Versace, Girolamo Etro, head of the Etro design house, and senior
officers from Italy's finance police.
The case broke a year ago just as fashion houses were putting the
finishing flourishes to their 1995 summer collections. It is one of a
string of Tangentopoli (''Bribesville'') scandals which have swept Italy
in the last few years.

Washington, Thursday,
AMERICA'S top general said today the US is ready to send 25,000 troops
to enforce a future Bosnia peace deal and warned it is vital they
''don't get pushed around'' like UN's soldiers have been.
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told Senators: ''The United States would be prepared to provide up to
25,000, but no more than half of the total force that would be
required.''
He added: ''It is very important that we size the force sufficiently
large enough so that when they go in they are robust enough to take care
of themselves no matter what else happens, and to ensure the freedom of
movement so they don't get pushed around like Unprofor has been pushed
around.''
President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers were to meet today to
discuss Bosnian peace efforts, and the size and shape of the US
contribution to a peacekeeping force, a White House official said.
Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke was to brief the
meeting on his attempts to win a peace deal.
The White House official said Clinton's staff want a sufficient force
sent in to minimise casualties. ''Nobody wants to risk not having
enough,'' he said.
In Bosnia, government and Croat troops today halted an offensive which
has given them control over half of the country and pushed the Serbs,
already battered by Nato air attacks, onto the defensive.
The pause in the 11-day onslaught which has turned tens of thousands
of civilians into refugees, appeared to end the risk of spreading the
war and derailing the fragile peace efforts.
Muslim forces with their Bosnian Croat allies -- backed by regular
army troops from Croatia itself -- have formed a frontline running from
the Croatian border, around Banja Luka and in towards central Bosnia.
But they have stopped short of Banja Luka itself, a Serb stronghold
swollen by refugees driven out by an offensive which at a stroke has
redrawn the map of Bosnia in a way years of talks failed to do.
In Sarajevo, Nato and the UN confirmed the Serbs have complied with
their demand to lift the siege of Sarajevo and pull back big guns.
They said the withdrawal of 235 Serb heavy weapons from the
12[1/2]-mile exclusion zone around the capital meant a resumption of air
strikes was ''currently not necessary''.
But Nato warned that fresh air strikes would come hard and fast if the
Bosnian Serbs caused further trouble.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said tonight that his army would
not enter Banja Luka, but he demanded the Serb military get out.
Speaking in Vienna, he said that was a condition that had to be met
before the Sarajevo government would consider a total ceasefire across
Bosnia.
He also said any ceasefire would be limited to 60 days, during which a
peaceful solution to end the war would have to be found.
''We can accept a ceasefire but we cannot accept an unconditional
ceasefire,'' he said before holding talks with Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel.
Another condition was free access to the mainly Muslim enclave of
Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, a UN-declared ''safe area''. The siege of
Sarajevo must also be lifted and normal supplies of gas, water and
electricity be reconnected to the thousands of civilians in the city, he
said.
Defence Correpondent Ian Bruce writes: Britain is to cut its troop
strength in the former Yugoslavia by 350 as part of a redeployment of
forces, although it will remain the single biggest contributor to the
UN's peacekeeping mission.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo announced today that manpower was
to be reduced to 8150 over the next two months, but reaffirmed the UK's
commitment to keeping a balanced fighting force in Bosnia through the
coming winter to protect safe havens and police any ceasefire which
might develop.
The 2nd Battalion, the Light Infantry, currently based in Germany, is
to replace the lst Battalion of the Devon and Dorsets when it completes
its six-month tour of duty in late October.
The headquarters' personnel of British Forces in Bosnia (Britfor) will
also rotate back to bases in Germany and the UK and be replaced, and all
armoured cavalry units with the exception of a single squadron of the
Light Dragoons are to be pulled out.
In addition, signals troops, logistical units and engineers are to
withdraw. Gunners based in the Croatian port of Ploce are to return
home, although their 105mm light guns will be left behind in case of the
need for emergency firepower. The men could be flown back within hours.
The reorganisation of the force was made possible by the ending of the
UN presence in the former safe haven of Gorazde last month. More than
300 British infantry left the town to avoid the risk of becoming
hostages as the Serbs advanced on the area.
Intelligence sources have disclosed that Bosnian Serb military
commander general Ratko Mladic has returned to duty after an operation
to remove a kidney stone. He is believed to be at his main headquarters
in the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka.
His presence in the threatened town is expected to boost Serbian
morale, dented by a week of coordinated Croat and Muslim offensives and
the seizure of thousands of square miles of territory held by the Serbs
since 1991.
Earlier this week, there were fears that the Croats and Muslims were
preparing to take Banja Luka by storm, a move which could bring Serbia
itself into the war on the side of its Bosnian allies.
It is now thought that the spearhead units advancing on the town in a
classic pincer movement have slowed down because of the problems of
maintaining supplies of ammunition, food and fuel. The Croat and Muslim
troops appear to have outstripped the capability of their own logistics
chain after surprisingly rapid gains across western and central Bosnia.
The Serbs are also concentrating much of their strength to block a
direct assault on the town. Many of the 232 heavy artillery guns
withdrawn from the hills around Sarajevo have been transferred to the
defence lines around Banja Luka.
Meanwhile, reconnaissance flights have revealed that the mainly Muslim
Bosnian government army is beginning a new build-up of infantry 25 miles
south of Sarajevo in a possible attempt to force the Serbs to keep their
already overstretched resources divided between two fronts.
* Three helicopter missions have failed to rescue two French airmen
shot down near the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, it was disclosed
today.
French defence minister Charles Millon also told a Senate panel that
Serbian head of state, Slobodan Milosevic, had told French President
Jacques Chirac he felt responsible for the pilots' lives, indicating to
Paris that they may be in the hands of Bosnian Serb forces.

RUDOLF Nureyev's Paris apartment, sealed since his death from Aids in
1993 after a legal dispute between his heirs, has been opened.
Its contents, valued at #2m, are to be sold by Christie's, which put
some of the lots on show in London yesterday.
The lots include: classical paintings -- mostly large male nudes of
the French nineteenth-century school; drawings -- more nude males --
that hung over his bath; nineteenth-century Russian birch furniture,
including his narrow little bed, and an eighteenth-century Rococo
chamber organ that stood beside it in his tiny bedroom; old prints of
the cities of Europe and stage designs that covered Nureyev's bedroom
walls from floor to ceiling.
In all, more than 700 items will go under the hammer at Christie's in
London on November 20 and 21.
This is the second and final sale of his possessions -- last January
the contents of his New York apartment made #5m at Christie's in New
York.
Among the less expensive sale items are Nureyev's initialled
table-knives and forks (estimate #400 to #600 the set), an initialled
napkin ring (#100 to #200), and a pair of Nureyev's own, nearly new
ballet shoes (#1000 to #1500).
When the Paris flat on the Quai D'Orsay was opened, a vast array of
costumes were also discovered.
There were also heaps of wedding jewellery from North Africa, silver
jugs and daggers from India, Tibet, and Persia lying around the rooms
and precious fabrics, including Indian Paisley-pattern shawls draped
over the furniture. All the contents are for sale.
The principal beneficiary of the sale, said Christie's director Mr
David Llewellyn, will be the Rudolf Nureyev Foundation, based in
Switzerland.
Nureyev established the foundation before his death to promote young
dancers, care for dancers who are ill, and sponsor medical research.

A COUPLE yesterday launched a #30,000 court action against the former
owner of their home because they claim she should have told them
planning permission had been granted for neighbouring land.
Jean and James Mackie, of Bardowie, Dunbartonshire, launched the
action against Mrs Lesley Jenkins, at Dumbarton Sheriff Court in an
attempt to retrieve almost #30,000, which they claim is the decrease in
value caused to their property by having another house 80 yards from
their back door.
Mr Mackie, 55, told the court that they paid #280,000, #30,000 over
the price listed by the estate agents because they were so determined to
get the house, called Hayhill.
Mr Mackie said that privacy and seclusion were top of his shopping
list when he and his wife embarked on their two-year hunt for their
ideal home.
He said they immediately fell in love with the bungalow because of the
countryside views on all sides.
However, a few months after they moved in, workmen began building
another house close by.
Mr Mackie, an electrical engineer, added: ''We would certainly not
have bought Hayhill if we had known what was going to happen.
''The property is in a designated conservation area and on green belt
land.
''It never crossed my mind that planning permission might have been
granted for any other building in the vicinity.''
The Mackie's counsel, Mr Peter Hammond, said there was no disputing
the fact that Mrs Jenkins was properly notified that planning permission
for the adjoining land had been sought.
He said: ''The seller had a duty, under the terms of the sale
contract, to disclose when a development might affect the value and
privacy of the property.
''The contract was designed to protect them from a situation like this
-- but it was breached.''
Mrs Jenkins, 35, who now lives in Milngavie with her husband and two
children, did not give evidence. She denies breach of contract.
The new house, which looks like a mini-church, was built by Mr Jack
Brewster who owns several farms in the area.
He was granted planning permission by the Secretary of State after a
five-year battle with Strathkelvin District Council, which persistently
refused his applications.
Mr Mackie told the hearing that since the new neighbours moved in, he
and his wife had no privacy.
He said: ''We no longer have the freedom to walk about in privacy. We
feel we are constantly under observation.''
Mrs Mackie, 54, told the court: ''We felt cheated.''
She said she suffered stress from construction noise for almost a year
while the other house was being built.
Sheriff Fred Levene is expected to give his decision soon.

AN engineer at Torness Power Station was recovering in hospital
yesterday after nine of his fingers were severed in an industrial
accident.
Mr Philip Barbary, 25, from East Linton, East Lothian, is expected to
retain 80% of the use of his left hand but surgeons said they were

THE SNP conference yesterday passed a motion calling on all those
concerned for the future of the Scotch whisky industry to support free
measures designed to ''ensure that the true potential of Scotch whisky
sales throughout the world can be realised''
These included an immediate reduction on excise duty by 10%, and a
commitment to the equalisation of tax levels as between whisky, wine,
and beer, and other drinks, according to the level of alcohol.
The motion, which was put forward by Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber
constituency association, said that conference believed that the
punitive tax regime pursued against the industry by successive London
Governments ''has stemmed from a failure to appreciate either the
industry's needs or its potentital.''
Conference earlier carried a motion urging the Government to double
the marketing budget for the Scottish Tourist Board, ''so that tourism,
which is one of our main industries, can compete on favourable terms
with other countries.''
Perth and Kinross SNP MP Roseanna Cunningham, speaking in support of
the motion said the ''scant attention and interest paid to the industry
by this Government is nothing short of scandalous.
''What is needed is a long-term, consistent, and meaningful commitment
and really a policy of putting your money where your mouth is.''

ONE of the most emotional standing ovations seen at the SNP conference
came when a founder of a new organisation bringing people of Asian
origin into the party said what independence meant to him.
Mr Bashir Ahmed (above) launched a new group called Scots Asians for
Independence. He told the conference that it was often assumed that
Asians would automatically vote Labour but his own experience suggested
otherwise.
''Many of us and our fathers and grandfathers have first-hand
experience of the struggle for independence,'' he said to widespread
applause.
''Their struggle against colonialism came when country after country
won freedom, but here in Scotland the struggle still goes on.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said he was confident the creation of the
group would create wider support for Scottish independence among Asians
who lived here.

THE SNP's flagship policy involving Scotland's relationship with
Europe suffered a setback yesterday when a long awaited set of policy
proposals were sidelined by conference.
The lengthy 13-part motion, intended to clarify the party's
Independence in Europe stance, was taken apart by delegates and its
author was forced to open the proceedings by remitting the matter back
for further consideration.
Some sources suggested that the affair damaged policy vice convener
Alex Neil, who faces a re-selection battle this weekend. However, he
said later the exercise had been worthwhile and the re-drafting of
European policy would be better informed by being carried out by the
grass roots up.
Instead of moving his own policy document, Mr Neil was forced to remit
it for consideration by a new European policy group being chaired by
Euro-MP Dr Allan Macartney.
A series of speakers castigated the official motion saying that
elements were blatantly contradictory and in some cases did not
safeguard small member states. A recurring theme was that the proposals
appeared to acquiesce in the running of Europe in the next century by a
powerful Central Bank rather than according to the wishes and needs of
the people.

SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing yesterday backed away from
comments interpreted as suggesting that she saw a devolved parliament in
Edinburgh as the fastest track to independence.
Mrs Ewing was at the centre of what has been an intense media campaign
this week to prise open differences of interpretation on pure
independence and devolution.
There was a renewed burst of activity when Mrs Ewing gave a broadcast
interview yesterday in which she said that waiting for the ''big bang''
of outright independence might take 40 or 50 years in contrast to the
process of confidence building which would take place under a devolved
parliament.
In her speech to conference yesterday, she moved quickly to clarify
this. ''Conferences are funny things,'' she said.
''All sorts of issues get debated and dissected in the bars and cafes
and even in the television studios. One of these debates today has been
about the timescale for independence.
''Will it take one year, or 20 years, or 50 years or even a century? I
know the answer to that question to the precise minute. Independence
will come when the Scottish people vote for it. Not a moment earlier or
a moment later.''
There was clear irritation from senior ranks in the party over efforts
to portray a split over an issue which they felt had been clearly laid
out almost 10 years ago and reiterated earlier this year.
Party leader Alex Salmond said they could not have been more clear on
their approach to demanding full independence but making use of
devolution if that took place.
Mrs Ewing made the point that the SNP had now achieved gender equality
at both parliamentary and European level -- victories achieved ''by hard
work, team spirit and dignity against the vitriol of opponents.''
She told the conference that she wanted to see the social conscience
and generous spirit of Scots exercised in the world at large. She also
claimed that people were fed up with ''carping, tantrums, and snide
repartee''.
She referred to sleaze and greed as well as the inane truisms of new
Labour and said Scots wanted to assert something different and positive.
She criticised Scotland's role as ''unjolly beggars'' staying in the UK
to seek handouts of trinkets, bobbles and bribes.
''Our opponents peddle their wares of Scotland as a dependent
non-nation. Their aim has been to dent the drive, to dull the spirit to
corrode the confidence of people. They -- the Unionists -- are the
dependency drones.,'' she said.
It was the job of the SNP to make Scotland more positive, upbeat and
confident. ''Moaning and groaning undermines self-belief,'' she said.

SINGER Chris De Burgh has denied a tabloid report that he is to
separate from his wife Diane.
The 44-year-old Irish star, best known for his song Lady In Red, was
reported to have resumed an affair with former nanny Miss Maresa Morgan,
20.
Mr De Burgh was photographed with Miss Morgan in London while his wife
was at the family's mansion home in Dalkey on the outskirts of Dublin.
A statement issued yesterday on the singer's behalf said: ''Chris and
Diane are most definitely not separated. They are together at the moment
at a secret rendezvous. They and their family would like some peace from
the press at this time.''
The couple have been married 17 years and have three children.
Last year, their relationship was threatened by revelations of an
affair with Miss Morgan, a local girl taken on to help with the children
while Mrs De Burgh recovered from a serious riding accident.
The singer later made a public apology for his ''stupidity'' and said
the affair with Ms Morgan had ended.

MORE than a thousand of Scotland's 42,000 wheelchair-bound people are
trapped in their homes because they are not suitably adapted.
Another five are confined to one of the country's 48 spinal injury
beds at a cost of #250 a day because they have no suitable home.
Now a guide to the rights of disabled people, which aims to help them
find a house for rent or how to go about adapting their own home, has
been launched by Scottish Homes.
It was launched in Glasgow yesterday by Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of
the National House Building Council, and produced by the Margaret
Blackwood Housing Association on behalf of Homepoint, the information
arm of Scottish Homes.
Mr Richard Gregory, director of Margaret Blackwood Housing
Association, said: ''Many people with physical disabilities were living
in wholly unsuitable housing but had never been informed about the
duties which housing departments have in providing a house for rent
which does not endanger their health.
''Some people can wait up to seven years for a suitable house. Many
people do not know that they may be in a position where they should be
rehoused immediately.''

A ROW broke out yesterday over Edinburgh's new #38m international
conference centre which opened its doors last weekend.
It is understood a feasibility study by consultants commissioned by
the enterprise company, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (Leel),
claims that the centre has insufficient space for exhibitions, and that
this could affect its future competitiveness.
However Leel has refused to reveal the report's full contents,
claiming that would breach commercial confidentiality.
A presentation on the study to councillors yesterday did not refer to
any recommendations or criticisms about exhibition space.
Leel chief executive Dr Des Bonnar, made the presentation to
councillors on the study which was commissioned by ScottishPower. In a
statement last night he said the conference centre was ''an unqualified
success''.
He stressed it was designed for a specific target market -- the
international conferences and conventions which were attended by
800-1200 delegates. These rarely required the huge exhibition space of
the massive occasional exhibitions.
''We were never going into that market because it was a different
market, and the cost of providing that level of space could not have
been justified,'' said Dr Bonnar. ''Both ourselves and our partners,
Edinburgh District Council, have always been well aware of this.''
The conference centre was a major new resource and would be a vital
component in attracting new business and commerce and therefore new
jobs.
The report also concentrates on examining the possibility of using a
building next to the conference centre and owned by ScottishPower to
provide an additional exhibition centre. It is said this would cost
#23m.
In the process, it is understood the report talks of the conference
centre's recognised weakness, which is that it has under 12,000 square
metres of exhibition space. The report apparently suggests that a
further 3000 to 4500 square metres should be provided for exhibitions.
Last night, opposition Tory councillors were demanding to know if the
district's Labour leadership had known of the study's detailed comments.
The Tory group leader, Daphne Sleigh, said she was ''very shocked'' by
what she had heard about the report, and would be demanding a full
investigation by the council, which is the main shareholder in the
conference centre.
''We must find out exactly what the position is with regard to
exhibition space at the conference centre,'' she said. ''Someone appears
to be hiding something. If we are deficient in exhibition space, now is
the time to decide how we can rectify that.''
Edinburgh District Council's Labour leader, Councillor Lesley Hinds,
who also chairs the conference centre's board of directors, strongly
denied that the centre had a design fault.
She stressed that there were already over 100 confirmed bookings.
Members of the centre's management team have also said that only three
out of 215 organisations which approached the centre had been put off by
the size of the exhibition space.
Councillor Hinds said she had not seen the Leel report. She emphasised
that the centre had been designed to target a specific market and it was
not possible for a centre to please every possible user.

AN RUC constable walked free yesterday from the High Court in Belfast
when convictions for murdering his estranged wife and father-in-law were
quashed by three appeal judges.
Mr Alan Anderson, 37, had been in custody since October, 1994, when a
jury at Craigavon Crown Court in County Armagh convicted him by a
majority of 10 to two. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.
However, the Northern Ireland Lord Chief Justice, Sir Brian Hutton,
said in a judgment delivered following a five-day appeal earlier this
month that the convictions were ''unsafe and unsatisfactory''.
Mr Anderson was tried twice for the murders. An earlier jury sitting
at Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, had failed to reach a verdict.
Yesterday, through his solicitor, Mr Anderson invited the RUC to
reopen the case.
The bodies of Judith Anderson, 36, and her father, 73-year-old retired
Church of Ireland rector the Rev Eric Davidson, were found in their
partly-burned home at Drum Road, Cookstown, County Tyrone, in December,
1992, three days before Mrs Anderson was to seek an uncontested divorce
in the High Court.
At first it was thought they had died in a fire but a post-mortem
examination revealed they had been badly beaten, stabbed through the
eyes, and set alight.
Mr Anderson sat impassively in the Court of Appeal as the Lord Chief
Justice, sitting with Lord Justices MacDermott and Nicholson, delivered
the 70-minute judgment which gave him his freedom. He sat back in his
seat and let out a long sigh as he was told he could go.
Sir Brian said that because the evidence against Mr Anderson had been
solely circumstantial and there were a number of circumstances which
could be viewed in varying degrees as being inconsistent with his guilt,
the trial judge should have used a part of his summing-up to ''remind
the jury in a specific way of the circumstances which could have been
viewed as being inconsistent with guilt''.
Mr Anderson left the court soon afterwards without making any comment.
His solicitor said his client was ''too emotional to say anything''.
RUC headquarters said Mr Anderson was ''presently suspended from duty
and remained so''. It has yet to say whether it would reopen the case.

CHEESEMAKER Humphrey Errington was the toast of London last night --
even though he narrowly missed out on a top award.
His court fight in Lanark over his blue cheese business has been
backed all the way by fellow producers across the UK.
He was given rousing support when he turned up at the British Cheese
Awards held in London's Canary Wharf.
Mr Errington, of Dunsyre, Lanarkshire, said: ''My cheese did not win a
prize but I have already won the magnificent support of my fellow
traditional cheesemakers.
He said they knew that if he lost his legal battle, he would have to
sell his farm.
His defence of Lanark Blue has the personal support of the Prince of
Wales.
Mr Errington faces a #90,000 legal bill in a battle which has taken
him into court to save five tonnes of last year's cheese made from
unpasteurised ewe's milk.
Clydesdale district food officers have tried four times to destroy the
cheese because they say it is riddled with a potentially dangerous food
bug, listeria monocytogenes.
The council's fifth bid to obtain an order to destroy the cheese will
resume at Lanark Sheriff Court next week.
Mr Errington said last night: ''Even if I win the case, I can't
recover any of the #90,000 costs.
''People at the awards have eaten my 1995 cheese. That was made in the
same place, using the same machinery and using the same ewes used to
provide milk to produce those five tonnes of cheese the council want to
destroy.''

A VISIT by the Princess Royal to Glenochil Prison, Clackmannan, has
been called off because of fears of a riot after Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth's random drug testing purge in jails.
Buckingham Palace last night refused to comment as the Scottish Prison
Service said the visit had been cancelled because of ''operational
reasons''.
Other sources confirmed, however, that Mr Forsyth's high-profile plans
had caused the serious drop in staff morale and the rise in inmate
unrest which was predicted in The Herald last month, when it was
revealed that random testing was a main plank in Mr Forsyth's law and
order programme.
It was plain yesterday that the Scottish Prison Service was
sufficiently worried by threats from inmates, telephoned at the weekend
to tabloid newspapers, to decide the risks of a royal visit were too
great.
The main architect of random drug testing in jails, the Home
Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, will be in Scotland this morning visiting
the drugs front line in Paisley to see the methods being employed in
Strathclyde Police's Operation Eagle to tackle the drugs.
He has been urged to see Operation Eagle by Mr Forsyth, who covered
the same ground last week and who is calling on Mr Howard to take the
lessons back with him to England.
He is likely to face questioning this morning about whether he was
aware of the cancellation of the Princess Royal's visit.
At the worst, the Princess Royal, who is patron of the Butler Trust, a
body which encourages initiatives in the prison service, might have
faced heckling.
Much play was made at that time of Mr Forsyth's announcement that the
initial testing at English prisons had been trouble free.
Prisoners lost remission if they tested positive in random drug
testing.
As The Herald pointed out, however, the testing had been piloted in
eight English prisons where reaction was more or less guaranteed to be
muted.
The reality of the English situation is that fearful prison officers
are fulfilling the Home Office urine testing quotas by procuring the
requisite number of weekly tests from prisoners they know to be drug
free while ignoring cells where men are sitting smoking cannabis or even
injecting drugs.
It was predicted by The Herald at the time of Mr Forsyth's
announcement that the Scottish prisons, containing a high percentage of
men jailed directly from the drugs culture, were a different
proposition.
It was plain last night that Mr Forsyth's bid to capture the law and
order high ground had backfired.
The Princess Royal's visit would have been the first test of direct
reaction to Mr Forsyth's intentions.
It is feared throughout the Scottish criminal justice system that Mr
Forsyth has scuppered the research work into drugs misuse which has been
successfully undertaken in Scottish jails on the basis of anonymous
saliva testing. This has built up an unprecedented picture of inmate
drug abuse.
That programme was primarily undertaken to inhibit the spread of
HIV/Aids and the uptake of the tests was as close to saturation as could
have been hoped. Prisoner participation is expected to diminish or even
vanish.
Mr Derek Turner, general secretary of the Scottish Prison Officers'
Association, said yesterday: ''Michael Forsyth, as we predicted, is in
serious danger of destroying all the good work that has been done in
Scotland in recent years.
''Sadly, he regards the Scottish prisons as nothing more than part of
his platform for addressing the Conservative Party conference which is
imminent. What gets the biggest cheers there -- law and order, hang 'em
and flog 'em.''
Mr Turner added: ''We are simply a political football which can be
kicked about to give them an ovation at their conference.''
Mr Turner added that prison staff believed Scottish Office civil
servants were now more concerned with implementing Tory Party desires
than following coherent policy.
The governor at Glenochil, Mr Leslie McBain, last night confirmed that
prison staff were disappointed over the cancellation of the royal visit
but he hoped it would be rescheduled.

FOOTBALL hardman Vinnie Jones had a ''superb evening'' last night --
chatting about the world of soccer to sixth-formers at Eton.
New boy Prince William was not eligible to attend the talk-in,
delivered by a man who was expelled from his comprehensive when he was
only 15.
The Wimbledon midfielder was invited to speak at a meeting of the Eton
Society, a group organised by the pupils themselves.
He then had a private chat with the school's soccer team.
The visit by the Wales international from the home counties was
controversial -- should a player with such a tough reputation be
addressing the lads at Eton?
However, Vinnie was given a loud cheer by his hosts.
When he left, he said: ''We had a superb evening. We just had a chat
about football.''
Pointing to a photograph he had given the head boy, he said: ''We have
left behind lots of memorabilia. We had a very enjoyable evening.''

SPLITS between Labour and the Liberal Democrats emerged again
yesterday, making it clear that both parties have a long way to go
before there can be any co-operation.
After a week dominated by speculation about closer links, Liberal
Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown and senior figures within the party
strongly rebuffed the overtures from Mr Tony Blair, while the Labour
leader said his agenda would not be set by the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Blair cast a shadow over the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow
when he suggested earlier this week that there could be policy issues on
which the two parties could co-operate.
The Liberal Democrats have tried to set out their own policies, while
giving a broad hint that they might find common cause with Labour. It
was obvious yesterday, however, that deep differences remain.
Mr Ashdown said his party would have no truck with Labour playing any
''deceit'' on the electorate over tax, and also made clear that he would
not support any Labour Government's Queen's Speech which did not include
a commitment to electoral reform.
The Liberal Democrat leader spoke out after Mr Blair pledged that a
Labour Government would not raise the overall burden of taxation, and
rebuffed calls by Mr Ashdown to join his party in the Commons division
lobbies to oppose any tax cuts in the November Budget.
As the Glasgow conference drew to a close, with activists worried
about too close co-operation with Labour, Mr Ashdown accused Labour of
timidity, dismissed accusations that Liberal Democratic policies
represented a lurch to the left, and once again made clear where he
stood.
He said: ''Proportional representation is an absolutely essential part
of a broad-ranging programme for what is right for Britain. I would not
be prepared to prop up any Government, or indeed vote for any
Government, which did not have a programme in the round that was good
for this country.''
Pressed if he would vote down a Queen's Speech which did not contain a
commitment to PR, he replied: ''We would vote down a Labour Government's
Queen's Speech that was not carrying the programme we thought dealt with
this country right. PR is part of that.''
Referring to the legislative programme as a whole, he added: ''Assume
you have a Labour Government's Queen's Speech which contains an
indecisive decision on Europe, a total failure to reform the rest of
Britain's constitution, which does not address the issues of education
under-investment -- but does contain PR. Would we vote that down? Of
course, we would.''
Mr Blair said in a newspaper interview: ''If Paddy wants to go around
saying how much he wants to raise people's taxes when they have had the
largest single tax rise in peacetime history under the Conservatives,
that is a matter for him. But I think he should reflect carefully upon
where he is positioning himself.''
On PR, he said: ''I have never been persuaded that if you go to a PR
system you don't end up with disproportionate power being wielded by
small parties -- and that's the problem.''
The Liberal Democrats believe they have established their ground and
are now waiting to see what emerges from the Labour and Conservative
party conferences. Mr Ashdown said yesterday of his relations with
Labour: ''Talks will happen when there is something to talk about. At
the present, there isn't.''
On the conference floor, senior Liberal Democrats launched strong
attacks on Labour. Scottish leader Jim Wallace followed up Mr Ashdown's
postcard to Mr Blair, with one of his own which said: ''Hey, Tony. Ye
didnae really think you wud get away with it did ye? We didnae come up
the Clyde on a water biscuit. We didnae really see ye through the week,
but we'll maybe see you through the windae.''
Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, who has been
portrayed as one of the leading advocates of closer relations with
Labour, said: ''The seriousness of our political purpose is underlined
by the specific way in which we have identified priorities and been
upfront about their revenue implications.
''But it would be wrong to read that as either an irresponsible, or a
carefully calculated lurch to the left. It is entirely distinct from
what is on offer elsewhere in British politics.
''The uncaring, selfish Conservatives competing with the uncosted,
silent Labour Party. Tricksters doing battle with the timorous.''
Ms Liz Lynne, Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on social security, who had
warned the party leadership against closer links with Labour, said she
believed ''absolutely'' that representatives in Glasgow had reinforced
her view.
''The vast majority of the people at this conference don't want to get
any closer to Labour. I would say it's about 70% of the conference, may
be more.''

THE British tell Irish jokes. The French tell Belgian jokes. And way
out in Harris we have Scalpay jokes . . . anyway in the SNP, especially
late at night in Perth's Salutation Hotel, they tell Labour jokes.
Iain Lawson, Paisley pest-control king and one of the great party
characters, has a good one about some Labour council's plan to brighten
up the harbour at Irvine. ''So someone said, 'Why not get boats and
canoes into the harbour -- get in a kayak' and this other guy, he pricks
up his ears. 'Hey, why not get two kayaks, then maybe they can breed.''
Jim Mitchell, Paisley's wee guy with the big visions, prefers to
recall great Labour malaprops from Renfrew District Council. ''You've
buttered your bed, so you can lie in it!'' Not to mention the sage
advice of one aged tribune of the people -- ''A leopard cannae changes
his horses in midstream.''
We whoop with laughter, and order the next round. There's about a
dozen of us round this big table, being regaled by Paisley's Little and
Large.
Lawson jumps back in. ''Here's a good one about Jim Callagan. They
came to him one day in No. 10 and said 'Prime Minister, the Archbishop
of Canterbury and Arthur Scargill are here to see you.'' ''Haw,'' said
Callaghan, ''I'll see the Archbishop first. I've only got to kiss his
ring.''
''And then,'' says Jim Mitchell, ''there was the transport committee
meeting when someone announced that there was this #15 deficit on a bus
route; what were they going to do with this deficit? And some Labour guy
piped up ''Can we no' give it to the driver?''
Catch on fishing
BACK to the Salutation for lunch on Thursday -- a seminar with the
Scottish Fishermen's Federation. Kind men in blazers press sandwiches
and coffee upon us. To their evident delight, the meeting is packed. We
jam into rows of those horrible hotel chairs and spend an hour thinking
about fishing.
Alex Salmond is the guest of honour, and this sort of thing shows him
at his best. He addresses us for 10 minutes without notes -- lucid,
witty, well-informed, his points deeply thought through.
The present crisis for the SFF is the menace of the Iberian fleet --
fishing boats from Spain and Portugal poised shortly to sweep into
Scotland's fishing grounds, which they will no doubt empty as they have
emptied their own.
The issue, of course, is of great importance to Salmond's constituents
in Banff and Buchan. It's a good line for the SNP because the industry,
still very important to rural Scotland, is of little account in the
larger United Kingdom.
The SNP's difficulty is that fishing is no less important to the West
Highlands than to the North-east. And, on almost everything that
matters, their interests collide.
I find it rather hard to imagine the Spanish wreaking much more
destruction in our waters than we have wrought ourselves. And you can't
blame the damage on overfishing simpliciter; it's also down to crazed
catch policies and evil fishing methods. A ban on sand-eel fishing, a
ban on scallop-dredging and a revival of traditional drift netting would
do much to restore a sustainable fishing economy. But such ideas are too
sensible, I fear, for European politicians.
Dull but capital
PERTH may not be interesting, but it has wonderful shops. Peering into
windows on my way to conference, I find fine family bakers, wonderful
displays of wet fish, old-fashioned ironmongers, and lots of very good
clothes shops. There's even a branch of Waterstone's.
Dull as it might be, Perth still would be my choice for the capital of
an independent Scotland. It's bang on the Highland frontier, it's very
central, the climate is excellent and it is not nearly as ugly as
Stirling. Above all, it's neither Edinburgh or Glasgow.
I wonder where President Salmond would built his Camp David?
Pitlochry?

THE leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Orkney and Shetland MP
Jim Wallace, was openly being talked about last night as the successor
to Paddy Ashdown.
His barnstorming speech at the close of the party conference in
Glasgow put him firmly in the frame for the leadership once Mr Ashdown
stands down.
There will be no challenge to Mr Ashdown this side of the General
Election, and he has made clear he will stay as long as the party wants
him. However, Mr Wallace, 41, is beginning to look like the heir
apparent.
The other obvious candidates would be Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP
Charles Kennedy and Fife North-East MP Menzies Campbell, but with his
speech yesterday Mr Wallace -- who succeeded former Liberal leader Jo
Grimond as MP -- threw himself into the fray. One senior Liberal
Democrat official said: ''Watch this space.''
Mr Wallace said that during the week his party had been able to show
-- not just to the people of Scotland but to people across Britain --
that it was committed to the whole United Kingdom, and understood that
the strength of the Union lay in ''a proper recognition of our
diversity.''
In a stinging attack on the SNP, he said: ''Contrast our unity with
the divisions reported at another party conference now in session in
Perth. I can well understand the SNP's discomfort. There are thousands
of Scottish voters deeply disillusioned with the way Scotland has been
misgoverned for so long.
''They know that voting Liberal Democrat will guarantee the reality of
a Scottish Parliament while the SNP offers only the candyfloss illusion
of independence once day, some day, never.''
In a direct challenge to SNP leader Alex Salmond, Mr Wallace told the
conference: ''He has said they will contest seats in our Scottish
parliament. But will they strive to make that Scottish Parliament work?
Or will they conspire to make it fail? Remember this -- if they
frustrate the work of the Parliament they will frustrate the will of the
people.''
On the Tories he said: ''Like the SNP, the Tory Party has sniped from
the sidelines at the work of the Constitutional Convention. They mock
the idea of constitiutional reform, play down its importance, even
dismiss it as 'loopy teenage madness.'
''We know why they do that. It is because such radical reform will
challenge their stranglehold on power and the priveleges and perks that
go with it.''
On Labour -- with whom Mr Wallace recently struck a deal on the number
of MPs that should make up a Scottish parliament -- he said: ''Their
endorsement of a Scottish Parliament seems to be the high watermark of
their commitment to real change -- and a short-lived high watermark at
that. For Labour the tide is  already going out and they are still in
opposition.
''They have reneged on their commitment to proportional representation
for a Welsh Assembly. They have shelved their proposals to decentralise
power effectively to the English regions, the House of Lords will be
safe in their hands.
''Tony Blair still has a blind spot over PR, the very guarantee of the
pluralist society he wants. Surely it is becoming clearer day by day
that there is a key distinction between ourselves and Labour.
''We see the problem of the 1990s as an over-powerful central
government which has to be contained and reduced. They see the problem
merely in terms of the wrong set of people being in charge of that
central government.
''We see the need for the ship to have an overall refit. Labour just
wants to change the crew. For Captain Major, substitute Captain Blair.
New Labour perhaps, but same old Britain.''

<TEXT>
BREWING giant Whitbread was yesterday condemned by anti-alcohol
campaigners after claiming that its latest superstrength lager was
brewed in a way that could limit the effect of a hangover.
Alcohol Concern said it was irresponsible of Whitbread to promote
Tungsten, which has a 9% alcohol content, in such a way. However, one of
Britain's leading brewing experts said Whitbread's claim could not be
dismissed and hailed the creation of the lager as an interesting
innovation.
Whitbread says Tungsten is the first UK beer to be made with husk-free
barley -- which is why it could leave drinkers with less of a hangover.
Barley husks are a major source of tannin, one of the known causes of
hangovers.
Barley husks are normally used because they help prevent beers
thickening during the brewing process.
Alcohol Concern condemned the promotion, saying superstrength lagers
were drunk mainly by young men who wanted to get drunk as quickly as
possible.
''I think this is very irresponsible to be promoting this on the basis
that it's going to give you less of a hangover,'' said a spokesman. ''It
can only encourage excess drinking.''
Nevertheless, Dr Keith Thomas, head of the University of Sunderland's
brewing school and technical adviser to the Campaign for Real Ale
(Camra), thought Whitbread might have made a step forward.
''I am not aware of this being done before,'' he said. ''It's an
innovative development that could be valuable. But in the end Tungsten
will need judging on the quality of the beer.''

THE ''fat cat'' bosses of the privatised utilities are paid much less
than directors of other major companies, according to a survey out
today.
It lists the directors of the electricity, gas, telecommunications,
and water utilities as having average total earnings of #219,904 -- more
than #81,000 behind the average board director's pay.
The survey, by executive remuneration and share scheme specialists New
Bridge Street Consultants, follows the Greenbury Report into executive
pay which was sparked by growing criticism of the rocketing pay enjoyed
by directors of the utilities.
Topping the survey's pay league table are directors from the oil and
gas exploration companies, whose total pay averages #412,500.
They are followed by directors from the banking sector (#350,000),
leisure and media (#254,167), retail and transport (#253,849), other
financial including property companies (#238,266), and consumer products
(#234,168).
Total pay is defined by New Bridge Street as basic pay, together with
annual bonus, free shares to ''match'' deferred annual bonus, share
options, and other long-term incentive plans.
The board director of a UK top 500 stock market company can expect to
earn an average #301,000 a year, the survey said.
Of the 496 main board directors surveyed, only nine were by women.
New Bridge Street consultant David Tankel believes increasing numbers
of companies would abandon executive share options.
''Nearly one in three companies has yet to impose performance
conditions on their share options but this practice is likely to become
a thing of the past
''Just over 50% of companies say they will introduce long-term
incentive plans -- often worth more than the options -- and Greenbury's
guarded preference for them is likely to accelerate their take-up.''

Small printing firm buys UK's largest publisher.
THE jobs of 350 printing staff at
Britain's largest publisher, HarperCollins, have been saved in an
eleventh-hour deal to sell the threatened plant.
The work-force was told at 8am yesterday that, after almost a year
with the threat of closure hanging over their heads, a buyer had been
found for the Bishopbriggs factory.
The new owner will be a small, Berwick-based company, Martins The
Printers, which has been a supplier to HarperCollins and employs around
50 people. Up to 100 redundancies are, however, expected from the
loss-making operation after the deal goes through.
Far from greeting the news with joy yesterday, many of the printing
staff expressed fears over their future. The majority of workers have
long service of between 17 and 25 years and there were concerns
expressed over loss of service, conditions, and the size of the company
taking them over.
Mrs Julie McInally, 34, said: ''It is like a corner shop taking over a
superstore. Most people want to keep their jobs and they are happy that
it is not being closed but if it had been somebody bigger we would have
felt better.''
Colleague Mrs Jeanette Hillicks, 35, who also works in the bookbinding
section, said: ''I don't feel relieved at all. I feel more concerned
than when I didn't know.''
Union recognition and collective bargaining have been guaranteed by
the company's new owner, Mr Chris Hardie, the print union GPMU said
yesterday.
Mr David Munro, GPMU Scottish officer, said: ''Pay and conditions are
something I'm going to have to discuss with the new owner. I spoke to
him this morning and asked for union recognition and a commitment to
collective bargaining. He has agreed. That's not a bad start.
''You must remember the company extended the deadline to close three
times and the alternative to the plant being saved was absolutely
horrendous.''
Mr Munro said the union was extremely happy that a buyer had been
found and said, given time, the work-force would agree.
''I think once it sinks in that there are 350 jobs being retained they
will be quite happy. The problem they have is that they have been
conditioned to wait for bad news and most of them expected it.''
HarperCollins is one of the country's most succesful publishers, with
authors including Jeffrey Archer, Tom Clancy, and Margaret Thatcher. It
employs around 2000 people nationally, however, it has not had enough
work to sustain the printing plant in Bishopbriggs. The company also
sold off its diary and stationery section earlier this year, reducing
throughput at the factory.
Mr Eddie Bell, HarperCollins executive chairman and publisher, said
the company could not expand its print business because of the
understandable reluctance of competitors to give them contracts.
''They are not going to give us substantial print contracts,'' he
said. ''That was the problem. It became virtually impossible to attract
third-party work.''
Mr Bell said the agreement to sell was a tremendous achievement:
''Since last November, when we announced our intentions, we have worked
really hard to bring this deal about.''
He dismissed staff grumbles as a pessimistic attitude: ''You know the
West of Scotland -- every silver lining has a cloud. As far as we are
concerned, this is great news. I think the staff expected us to announce
closure this morning. Instead, we told them we have found somebody who
wants to take this on.
''They have had a tremendous roller-coaster ride since November. I
don't expect them to be bursting with enthusiasm. But it is a great
result and preserves the jobs and the local business.''
The new owner, Mr Chris Hardie, has a background of working for large
companies and turning them around, said Mr Bell. ''About three years ago
he decided he wanted to go on his own, bought Martins and has turned it
into a company making terrific profits.''
Local MP Sam Galbraith also welcomed the move, saying: ''I'm
delighted, first of all that we have been able to save so many jobs and
I'm also delighted that the company that is going to take it over is
Scottish. This is a good deal for everyone.''
Mr Hardie could not be contacted for comment yesterday but in a
prepared statement he said: ''As an existing approved supplier to
HarperCollins, I am delighted at the prospect of this new venture.
''I am confident that together we can develop this business to be a
successful stand-alone volume book manufacturer. I am also pleased to
see an end to the uncertainty the staff have had to bear and look
forward to working with them.''

SCOTLAND's salmonfarming industry, and several thousand jobs dependent
on it, have been jeopardised by the uncaring attitude of the Westminster
Government, the SNP conference in Perth was told yesterday.
Prospective candidate for Inverness, Mr Fergus Ewing, proposed backing
for the creation of a new producers' organisation, to put an end to the
boom and bust cycle which the salmon industry faced under fierce
competition from subsidised counterparts in Norway.
But he said the Government had paid little heed to this. ''This time
around, we are not waiting for an industry to collapse and then come in
as undertakers,'' he said.
He was seconded by a new party member and former leading light in the
salmon farming industry, Mr David McCarthy, who condemned London's
''obdurate refusal to help''.
The conference agreed to back the creation of a producers'
organisation which would control the trade, avoid the current cyclical
nature of the industry, and protect it against competition from Norway.

THE Liberal Democrat youth wing made a muted call yesterday to lower
the age of consent for gay sex.
Fears that the youth fringe would embarrass the party leadership by
loudly demanding a reduction in the age of consent were laid to rest
during a series of speeches aimed at attacking the Government rather
than promoting high-profile policies.
The youth speakers concentrated on the problems of homelessness,
poverty and disillusionment among young people and there was only one
reference to the youth wing's stated policy on homosexual sex --
reducing the age of consent to 16.
Youth Development Office Councillor Jo White, 21, (Chesterfield) said:
''There should be a common age of consent regardless of a person's
gender, or sexual orientation.''
There was no vote on youth issues and instead of pursuing the youth
policy of allowing people to stand for Parliament at the age of 16, the
speakers emphasised their policy to lower the voting age to 16.

ON JANUARY 1, in the year 2000, a Scottish parliament should be able
to take all crofting land in Scotland, more than a million acres
publicly and privately owned, and transfer ownership to the local
communities, it is claimed.
All this could be achieved for less than #10m, a National Lottery
jackpot in a fairly average week, and leave the crofting landlord to
pass into history, according to writer and historian Dr Jim Hunter.
It is part of the challenge he will issue to a Scottish parliament
when he delivers the John McEwen Memorial Lecture in Dingwall today.
It is the third anniversary of the death in Blairgowrie of forester
John McEwen, just three days short of his 105th birthday.
He had devoted much of his later life campaigning to break the power
of Scotland's landlords, at the age of 90 publishing the first real land
agenda in twentieth-century Scotland.
In his memory, Dr Hunter will argue that by the time the twenty-first
century begins, a Scottish parliament could begin to change radically,
and control, who owns Scotland.
It would require the eradication of feudalism from the law and
changing the relationship between landlords and the Scottish people.
In addition, Scotland's crofting communities should be given control
of their own land.
Dr Hunter argues that there should not be ''any major expenditure
involved in bringing privately owned crofting estates into community
ownership'' or great difficulty with those owned by the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department (SOAFD). The 1976 Act allows
crofters to buy their crofts at roughly 15 times their annual rent,
which would mean the whole thing could be completed for under #10m.
''To transfer SOAFD's crofting estates to their occupiers would
actually be to make an ongoing public expenditure saving, in that SOAFD
would be freed of a considerable administrative cost,'' he says.

THE Government yesterday committed itself to helping small businesses
fulfil their role as the job creators of the future by attacking red
tape and addressing punitive tax rates.
Hosting a seminar in Downing Street, the Prime Minister said he wanted
to free small businesses from the burden of government in order to
''renew the impetus for enterprise in Britain''.
The meeting, attended by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Deputy Prime
Minister Michael Heseltine and leading bankers and industrialists,
coincided with the second day of Labour leader Tony Blair's campaign to
reassure the City.
Mr Major told the seminar the Government's strategy for encouraging
enterprise consisted of four elements: a stable economy, free markets,
reining in the public sector and practical Government assistance.
Labour reacted dismissively by suggesting Mr Major should first
apologise to British businesses for the Government's economic record.
Shadow Trade Secretary Jack Cunningham said: ''In the world
competitiveness league table, we have dropped from 14th to 18th in the
last 12 months.''
The Prime Minister said the Government wanted policies designed for
the next century. ''The greatest barrier to enterprise is the weight of
government itself. We have to rein in spending, cut the tax rates that
kill incentives and simplify administration wherever possible,
particularly Paye and VAT.''
He emphasised the importance of small firms as the employers of more
than half the private sector workforce and the creators of more than two
million jobs since 1980. ''They will be the job creators in the future
and their share of the economy will continue to grow,'' Mr Major said.
''But they also have a broader value. Small firms embody the society
of opportunity I want to see in Britain, where people can make better
lives for themselves, for their families and for their employees.''
He accepted that many small companies had suffered in the recession,
but emphasised the importance of low inflation and steady export led
growth. ''We have fought to bring down trade barriers for British
exports and we have secured the most flexible labour markets in
Europe.''

THE SNP said yesterday that it was on a mission to persuade Scots that
Scotland cannot afford to remain in the Union and admitted that the most
challenging part of its campaign was to build public confidence that the
country would have a better economic future with independence.
Speaking in support of a key motion on the Scottish economy, SNP
Treasury spokesman John Swinney said that at the last election Scots
were ''frightened, unnerved, and, in some cases, hoodwinked into voting
for the Unionist parties.''
However, the Union had cost jobs at Rosyth, it did not protect
pensions, and business had been crippled by the economic mismanagement
of successive Unionist governments.
''It's not that Scotland can't afford to leave the Union. Scotland
can't afford to remain in the Union,'' he said.
Mr Swinney said the SNP would present its case on three main points:
* The static budget published under the heading ''Paying our fair
share and more'' shows that Scotland pays her way in the United Kingdom.
* Secondly, the economic spin-off simply of becoming independent would
be set out.
* How SNP policy would change the lives of people in Scotland through
a package of economic and social measures.
Mr Swinney said: ''Labour and the Tories are all so keen to peddle the
myth of the subsidised Scot. A Budget deficit of #8bn would cripple
Scotland, they say.
''But their figures are nonsense, they never take due account of oil
revenues, they never take account of the dreadful state of the UK's
public finances which implicates Scotland. They never take account of
all Scottish tax raised, and they certainly don't take account of the
massive subsidies given to the South of England hidden in murky pots
within the UK's statistics.''
Mr Swinney said the SNP had presented into the public domain figures
for this financial year -- 1995-96 -- which showed that Scotland has a
budget surplus.
''Where are everyone else's figures. They promise. They issue outdated
information. The Tories are still sprawling about in 1992 figures when
they peddled lie after lie to gain re-election.''
In the most fiery speech of the afternoon, Mr Alex Wood, the former
left-wing leader of Edinburgh District Council in the mid-1980s, said:
''The issue of privatisation is central to what has gone wrong in this
society over the last 10 to 15 years and the record of privatisation
itself speaks volumes.''
To much applause, he added: ''At a time when the Labour Party have
left totally any commitment to the public sector and to public
ownership, at a time when the Scottish people remain committed to a
cooperative society and not a profiteering society, we should be stating
from the outset that we will take back these formerly publicly owned
utilities and other industries.''
The conference backed a motion stating that the Scottish economy could
only reach its full potential with Independence in Europe.

THREE successive Olympic failures, one by Birmingham and two by
Manchester, both of whom bid in recent years to host the games, has
finally persuaded Britain to call a halt.
Instead, the British Olympic Association yesterday voted to attempt to
stage them in 2008.
The association's chairman, Glasgow financial consultant Craig Reedie,
would not be drawn as to whether London would be the prospective venue,
despite having been told by Olympic committee insiders that it is
Britain's only credible candidate city.
''We want a proper, informed debate, and to let the selection process
take its course,'' insisted Mr Reedie. ''But there was a feeling among
some of our members that London is the only possible venue.''
Wembley yesterday unveiled a #168m blueprint for the proposed new
national stadium and a London Olympic bid may hang on whether the Sports
Council decides in its favour, in the face of other stadium alternatives
in Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, and Bradford.
Mr Reedie admitted the council's choice of venue for the
lottery-funded national arena was ''significant''. That decision is due
next month but, in view of the Olympic bid, the BOA now wants the
stadium verdict delayed.
Meanwhile, Scottish Olympic hopefuls bidding for a place in the
British team for next year's games in Atlanta, yesterday threw their
weight behind a #4m cash appeal to help them get there.
Adding his support to the nationwide appeal launched in Scotland's
major cities and in London, was former boxer Dick McTaggart, who knows
the glory of picking up gold.
Mr McTaggart, now a still fit 60-year-old, won lightweight gold in
Melbourne almost 40 years ago, and followed it with a bronze four years
later.
At the Glasgow launch yesterday, Mr McTaggart, who also won the Val
Barker Trophy for the most stylish boxer in Melbourne, was assisted by
Melanie Neef who, with a time of 51.18, is currently Britain's fastest
woman over 400 metres.
Similiar launches took place in Edinburgh, Dundee, and Aberdeen, and
the British Olympic Association hopes to raise #250,000 for the appeal
in Scotland, topping the amount raised for the Barcelona Olympics by
#10,000.
Among events planned to help raise the cash are a celebrity dinner at
Glasgow's Moat House Hotel, next January, and a gala dinner in
Edinburgh's new conference centre, next March.
Pupils throughout Scotland will be asked to support the Pound the
Olympic Mile -- which aims to gather enough one pound coins to be laid
edge to edge for a mile around Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh.

Majorca
WITH a troublesome Tory conference looming, Mr John Major arrives in
Majorca today determined to escape unharmed from the European minefield.
He will spend two days here discussing a whole range of potentially
divisive issues as his party's Euro-sceptics prepare to pounce next
month on any perceived concessions to EU integration.
Most of the EU heads of government -- here for strictly informal but
critical talks -- have grown impatient with Britain's stand on a range
of issues which cause Mr Major problems at home.
They include the prospect of more majority voting in the Council of
Ministers, a proposed common defence policy, a single European currency,
and more powers for the European Parliament.
Mr Major's lonely stand in Europe was not helped last month by signals
from Paris that President Jacques Chirac appears to have gone back on
his word to support Britain in resisting majority voting.
The heads of government are here at the invitation of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, Spain's Prime Minister. But Mr Major will be seeking support
against a common European defence force, to help heal Tory divisions at
party conference and in the Commons after summer recess.
The 15 EU leaders will thrash out how they see Europe's future. Their
agenda will be topped by how to proceed at next year's super-summit on
the Maastricht review and what is needed to improve working procedures
as the next round of enlargement looms, beckoning a Europe of more than
20 members with poorer newcomers from the former Eastern bloc.
Mr Gonzalez has taken his cue from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl who
called an informal dinner for government heads in Essen last year. No
officials were allowed near.
It was seen as a great success, and Mr Gonzalez wants a repeat which
would help his damaged standing in domestic politics. Even Foreign
Ministers are not invited but European Commission President Jacques
Santer will attend.
''I wish to underline the informal character of this meeting, which I
am convinced will be a key element in ensuring a rich exchange of
views,'' Mr Gonzalez wrote in his invitation.
He is worried by Basque terrorists whose plan to assassinate King Juan
Carlos of Spain in Majorca earlier this year, at a spot not far from the
conference venue in Formentor, was foiled by the security forces. This
explains the heavy police and military presence during the conference.
Majorca this weekend is truly a garrison island.

BROADCASTER David Dimbleby has weighed into the constitutional debate
with a warning to devolutionists and nationalists not to ignore the
feelings of the English in their campaign to change the Union.
Mr Dimbleby -- who last night chaired BBC1's Question Time in Glasgow
which featured Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson and SNP MP
Roseanna Cunningham -- said those leading the debate had failed to take
into account views south of the Border.
''Nobody really bothers about what the English think. You hear a lot
from 10 million people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not
much from the other 48 million,'' he said.
Mr Dimbleby has toured the UK gathering views for a BBC radio series,
beginning in Scotland and finishing in England, where he found little
knowledge and much uncertainty over the future of the UK constitution.
''The conclusion I came to was that once there is a Scottish
parliament, if Labour wins, and the issue of the block grant is raised,
that's the moment when people will start up and have second thoughts,''
he said.
The Scottish Office receives its funding allocation in the form of a
block grant from central government, based on a formula designed to
reflect particular Scottish needs.
Recent figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest a
Scottish parliament would face an immediate 16% revenue shortfall
requiring Westminster subsidy.
''Federalists and devolutionists and nationalists should be a little
more wary and sensitive of the reaction in England. The assumption is
always that the English are colonialists. I'm not sure that's actually
true any longer,'' he said.
His discussion with ordinary people in England disclosed a willingness
to consider a change in the Union. ''There's a possibility that England
might say, 'fine, save us some money and some aggro, off you go','' he
said.
Mr Dimbleby, 56, the BBC's senior presenter, describes himself as
three quarters English, one quarter Welsh. ''I've never really thought
of myself as British, but rather English,'' he said.
He is not an instinctive defender of the Union, which he believes is
technically only 75 years old. Even considered from the Act of Union of
1707, ''in the whole span of history that's not very long,'' he said.
The Union was not the result of natural forces but of economic, trade
and anti-Catholic considerations. ''If it no longer feels right then it
wouldn't be the end of the world if it were undone,'' he told the
Herald.
''I don't take an imperialist view that Britain is stronger with the
Union. I don't believe that every sort of complaint about the Union is a
heinous attack on the most sacred country that ever was.''
Mr Dimbleby denied being part of the London chattering classes because
Question Time, the weekly current affairs programme he has led since
last year, tours the country and hears views from all over the UK.
His five-part series, The Disunited Kingdom, in which he has avoided
speaking to the politicians at the centre of the devolution debate, will
go out on Saturdays on Radio 4 at 11am.
''A lot of people haven't heard this stuff. Home rule and separate
assemblies are very much on the agenda of the countries directly
involved, but they are not on the agenda in England. But in the end it
is going to be an English decision,'' he said.

SINN Fein President Gerry Adams predicted last night that the Northern
Ireland peace process was doomed to collapse if the Government continued
to insist on arms decommissioning by the IRA before all-party talks.
He said in Belfast: ''In my view, the British Government is not
interested in building peace in our country. This British Government is
interested only in destroying the peace process.''
In his most pessimistic mood since the calling of the IRA ceasefire
just over a year ago, Mr Adams said: ''The placing of preconditions on
the road to dialogue is indeed a formula for disaster and the British
Government have shown no willingness at all to lift that new
precondition.
''It is my view that if the British Government stick to their
position, as it appears they will, then the peace process -- or this
phase of the peace process -- is doomed to collapse.''
Insisting he was not trying to cry wolf, he said he was making a
''realistic assessment of the situation''.
The British Government, he said, had not moved one inch from a
one-point agenda.
''There can't be peace unless they are part of it and the more they
stick to this position the more those of us who created this opportunity
are marginalised.
''As I have said, this British Government, John Major's Government, is
not interested in peace in our country,'' he said.
Mr Adams said he was not threatening but ''there is only so much Sinn
Fein can do. We have done our very best . . . the British Government are
not interested.''
His comments came after former Northern Ireland Office Minister
Michael Mates told a gathering of British and Irish parliamentarians in
Wales that they should be prepared for a return to violence if the IRA
did not move on the decommissioning issue.
It was thought Mr Adams's gloomy summary of the prospects for peace
was directed mainly at the Dublin Government, in advance of the meetings
expected to be held by Mr John Major and his Irish counterpart Mr John
Bruton at this weekend's European summit in Majorca.
The meeting between the two leaders that the Irish called off last
week is firmly believed to have been cancelled by Mr Bruton after
pressure from Sinn Fein.
Mr Adams is thought to have been concerned about his party's position
and the likelihood of London and Dublin standing together against him on
decommissioning when Mr Bruton hinted, 48 hours later, that the two
Governments may be prepared to agree a decommissioning deal and go ahead
without Sinn Fein.
Nevertheless, Mr Adams's comments will engender worry throughout
Northern Ireland and add to fears that a return to terrorist violence is
indeed possible.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister yesterday vowed to continue working
towards a long-term peace in Northern Ireland.
He reaffirmed that all-party talks and an international body to
oversee decommissioning of arms was the ''best way forward from where we
are at present''.
Mr Major, speaking to a group of visiting Irish journalists at Downing
Street said the fact his recent summit at Chequers with Irish Premier
John Bruton had to be postponed was a ''setback, not a crisis''.

<HEADLINE>British Gas apologises over leak in pipeline</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976257351</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A GAS leak that could have led to a disaster was blamed on underground
subsidence last night.
British Gas admitted there were ''lessons to be learned'' almost two
years after the leak led to a village being evacuated.
Residents in Beattock in the Borders were moved from their homes in
December 1993 after the pipeline fracture seeped gas which caused a
giant hole in a field.
The A74 and a railway line nearby were shut for several days after the
incident.
At the time, Sir Hector Monro, then Scottish Office Minister, said the
incident could have led to a disaster.
In a meeting in the village last night, British Gas said the leak had
been caused by ground underneath the pipe subsiding ''more than
expected''.
The pipe had been moved to make way for the M74.
This subsidence caused the pipe to bend more than usual, and one of
the welds fractured under the pressure.
Specialists from the British Gas research and technology division
conducted the 21-month investigation, under the supervision of the
Health and Safety Executive.
During the investigation, other areas where pipelines had been moved
were checked but found to be safe.
The investigation into what caused the 30ft wide by 12ft deep crater
cost British Gas #500,000. Last night, British Gas apologised to the
villagers.
Mr Phil Hopkins, research and technology development manager, said:
''We met the public soon after the incident happened and we apologised
for the inconvenience caused to them.
''We made a promise that we would come back and tell them exactly what
happened when we found out ourselves.
''We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to them at the time.
''We understand their worries over a recurrence but we are now happy
that the pipe is safe.''
He said it was not an explosion that caused the crater but a seepage
of gas that collapsed the soil. However, he said there was never any
danger of anyone being hurt.
At the time the pipe was laid, work was carried out to certain
standards applicable then. British Gas says those standards have been
changed following the incident.

A COOL look at Britain's future in Europe by the new Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind delighted Tory Euro-sceptics and probably guaranteed a
Tory party conference without turmoil next month.
Mr Rifkind's theme: British national interests will prevail even if it
affects our influence.
The Prime Minister meets his EU partners in Majorca today for an
informal summit on European integration. Mr Rifkind's intervention in a
keynote speech indicates a tougher British negotiating stand.
''Occasionally it may be appropriate to accept a lot of influence if
that is the only way we can protect our interests.'' He made it clear
that Britain will not be railroaded into a single currency and closer
political integration. The UK will maintain border controls and its
opt-out of the Social Chapter.
He declared: ''The nation state remains the basic building block of
the international system. It is nation states to which most people feel
their first allegiance. International relations are still principally
about dealings between states.''
He chose the prestigious Institute of International Affairs to launch
his first statement of how he intends to conduct foreign policy since he
took over from Mr Douglas Hurd.
He continued: ''We must constantly remind ourselves that influence is
a means, not an end in itself. Occasionally it may be appropriate to
accept a loss of influence if that is the only way we can protect our
interests.
''There can be no phoney unity. What we must not do is suppress
important national interests in order to construct an artificial
consensus, a bogus unity, that lacks credibility or conviction.''
He intends to deal with the European Union in these terms. He will
look at proposals for further integration by a ''cool assessment of the
British interest''. This will be weighed against the benefits of
co-operation as it affects our influence.
He warned: ''If harmonisation would be harmful to the United Kingdom,
or if it were being pursued for ideological rather than practical
reasons, we should oppose it with courtesy, courage, and conviction.''
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook at once attacked Mr Rifkind, who
he said was betraying a terrible defeatism: ''Five years ago, John Major
said that his Government would put Britain at the heart of Europe. Today
we have a candid admission from the Foreign Secretary that they have
failed in that objective and are prepared to put Britain at the margins
of Europe.
''By preparing to precipitate a crisis in relations with our partners
and undermine Britain's influence in Europe, the Tories are damaging our
vital interests and putting British jobs at risk.''
However, the Tory Euro-rebels rejoiced last night in the belief that
they had succeeded in shifting British policy on further political and
economic integration. Mr Bill Cash declared: ''We've won the argument.
There were some very constructive points in the speech and what they
suggest is that re-negotiation of Maastricht has to be put on the
agenda.''
Sir Teddy Taylor said: ''I think that every Euro-sceptic will welcome
what appears to be a substantial change in the tone of the Foreign
Secretary's approach to the EU.''
The Majorcan summit this weekend is unlikely to bring things to a head
in regard to the Franco-German drive for a single currency. Indeed, our
European partners appear to wish to delay proceedings and historic
decisions until after the next British General Election.
Meantime, Mr Rifkind, in a speech cleared by the Prime Minister, has
established a new hard-nosed attitude in the Foreign Office. He has an
eye to the overriding necessity for the Tory party to unite on this
issue at its party conference and thereafter in the run-up to the
General Election.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine said last night
that Britain was blessed with a ''very auspicious combination of
economic circumstances'' and had a real chance of ending decades of boom
and bust.
In an upbeat assessment echoing Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's speech on
Wednesday, Mr Heseltine said the slowdown in the rate of economic growth
from the very high level of last year was not a cause for concern.
The economy was ''simply shifting down a gear to a more sustainable
rate'' of expansion, he told the Smith New Court annual dinner at
Clivedon.

<HEADLINE>Stena and French in clash over grounding</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976257353</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
STENA Sealink clashed with port officials yesterday over the grounding
of one of its ferries off Calais earlier this week.
The French are disputing the company's claim that the Stena Challenger
was put at risk of running aground minutes before it actually did.
The discord between the Calais port authority and Stena came as the
official investigation into the incident got under way. The 18,500-tonne
ferry became beached on a sandbank as it waited to enter Calais in a
storm on Tuesday night.
The ferry, which had sailed from Dover on what was supposed to be a
90-minute crossing with 250 passengers and crew on board, remained
stranded for almost 24 hours, until it was finally pulled free by tugs
and allowed to dock on Wednesday night.
The investigation is likely to centre on three possible contributory
factors -- human error, bad weather or mechanical failure.
Mr Gareth Cooper, Stena Sealink's managing director, has already
scotched the idea that the weather conditions alone were to blame,
despite the 40-knot winds and rough seas.
''It is quite clear that a force eight gale, in itself, should not
have caused this,'' he said.
Any suggestion that the four-year-old ferry developed a mechanical
fault has also been dismissed by its operators.
A full inspection of the ferry will take place in dry dock in Dunkirk
today but an initial inspection was carried out after it had been pulled
free and berthed in Calais.
Of the major factors which could have been responsible for the
incident, it would appear to leave just human error.
So far, the captain of the vessel, who has not been named, has
received the backing of his employers, who say he will remain in his
position pending the results of the inquiry.
Meanwhile, the company yesterday hinted that a fourth possible factor
may have contributed to the vessel running aground, as the Stena
Challenger had been waiting outside Calais harbour on the orders of the
port authority.
Mr Cooper said it had to wait in open waters in stormy conditions to
allow departing ferry the Pride of Burgundy, owned by P &amp; O European
Ferries, to exit.
However, it is a concern that the Calais port authority has dismissed
as ridiculous.
A spokesman, Mr Gerard Barron, said: ''A boat like the Stena
Challenger should be capable of staying in a holding position for up to
24 hours.''
Although Mr Barron has confirmed that the Stena Challenger was not
allowed to enter the harbour immediately, he said the delay was no more
than 10 minutes.
He said he believed that despite Stena's initial claims, the
Challenger did suffer partial, if not total, engine failure.
However, he added: ''A boat or a machine is never entirely responsible
in these circumstances. There is always human error.''

Singer tells court how accountant 'controlled' cash flooding in from
all over the world.
THE Queen's personal bankers, Coutts, repaid Sting #4.8m which had
allegedly been siphoned from his account, a court was told yesterday.
Sting told Southwark Crown Court in London that the money was paid
back after it was allegedly taken by Mr Keith Moore, the singer's
accountant.
Mr Neill Stewart, prosecuting, told the jury that the bankers had to
bear some of the responsibility for the movement of the #4.8m between
August 1988 and July 1992.
He said Coutts had wrongly transferred the money to an account
controlled by Mr Moore at another bank without specific authority.
Sting told the court: ''We were successful. Coutts paid me the money
back.''
The singer also told how money flooded in from all over the world when
his group, Police, became successful.
Sting, 43, a former teacher, said he had relied ''a great deal'' on Mr
Moore, who is accused of stealing #6m from him.
Mr Moore, 51, of Fulham, London, who ran a chartered accountancy firm
in Notting Hill, was needed to ''control'' his burgeoning income.
Mr Moore denies 15 sample charges of theft between August 1988 and
July 1992. It is alleged he used large amounts of Sting's fortune in
unsuccessful speculative ventures and twice to ''stave off'' bankruptcy.
Sting, who arrived at the court with two bodyguards in a
chauffeur-driven Daimler, told the court he formed Police in the late
70s.
In those early days ''I spent some time on national assistance, which
was about #16 a week'', he said.
The group suddenly became successful and his income shot up to ''many
hundreds of thousands a year''.
Income flooded in from around the world. ''There were record
royalties, mainly from the international sale of albums and singles,
performance royalties from giving concerts, publishing royalties from
the songs I wrote, and performance royalties from the songs on the
radio, and I also acted in films,'' he said, adding: ''I think that is
all.''
Mr Neill Stewart, prosecuting, asked: ''Were you in a position to keep
track of the finances.''
Sting replied: ''It was very complex. I needed an accountant. I needed
someone I could trust.'' That someone was Mr Moore.
Sting said that if he wanted to know how much he was worth, he would
go to Mr Moore to find out.
He said the financial adviser would sometimes bring him forms,
cheques, and ''releases'' to sign.
Sting said he had 47 different bank accounts, mostly at Coutts in
London.
In the early 1980s, he received statements which gave a round figure
of what he was worth, but later they stopped coming.
Sting said he read every letter from Mr Moore, although he admitted
that he did not always examine details of transactions.
He admitted having found a letter authorising Mr Moore to transfer
money to accounts in Mr Moore's own name but said he had never intended
to do so.
He became aware of 30 unauthorised payments made by Mr Moore only
after receiving an anonymous letter in 1992 asking his advisers to make
investigations.
The performer said he had a ''face to face'' with Mr Moore in the
Hilton Hotel, London, in September 1992. Also present were his solicitor
and two managers, Miles Copeland and Kim Turner.
Sting said Mr Copeland read out a list of allegations against the
financial adviser.
Mr Moore was then questioned about the #691,000 tax bill he paid with
the singer's money, staving off bankruptcy in the process.
Sting told the court: ''Mr Moore said he was ashamed of himself and
didn't know what had come over him and was desperate.''
Following this, said Sting, his solicitor prepared a letter listing
the accusations made against the accountant.
However, Mr Moore allegedly refused to sign it until he had taken
legal advice.
The singer was also questioned about his attitude towards investing
his money. Sting said that after one company into which he ploughed
#150,000 ran into trouble he decided to ''call it a day''.
He said he had since put a large slice of his income into his various
properties. He has homes in Wiltshire, New York, and Los Angeles.
Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, opening the defence, put it to Sting that he
was too busy to control his business.
The singer replied: ''My control is fundamental and it was based on
the bank mandates which I controlled.''
The trial continues.

radio, and I also acted in films,'' he said, adding: ''I think that is
all.''
Mr Neill Stewart, prosecuting, asked: ''Were you in a position to keep
track of the finances.''
Sting replied: ''It was very complex. I needed an accountant. I needed
someone I could trust.'' That someone was Mr Moore.
Sting said that if he wanted to know how much he was worth, he would
go to Mr Moore to find out.
He said the financial adviser would sometimes bring him forms,
cheques, and ''releases'' to sign.
Sting said he had 47 different bank accounts, mostly at Coutts in
London.
In the early 1980s, he received statements which gave a round figure
of what he was worth, but later they stopped coming.
Sting said he read every letter from Mr Moore, although he admitted
that he did not always examine details of transactions.
He admitted having found a letter authorising Mr Moore to transfer
money to accounts in Mr Moore's own name but said he had never intended
to do so.
He became aware of 30 unauthorised payments made by Mr Moore only
after receiving an anonymous letter in 1992 asking his advisers to make
investigations.
The performer said he had a ''face to face'' with Mr Moore in the
Hilton Hotel, London, in September 1992. Also present were his solicitor
and two managers, Miles Copeland and Kim Turner.
Sting said Mr Copeland read out a list of allegations against the
financial adviser.
Mr Moore was then questioned about the #691,000 tax bill he paid with
the singer's money, staving off bankruptcy in the process.
Sting told the court: ''Mr Moore said he was ashamed of himself and
didn't know what had come over him and was desperate.''
Following this, said Sting, his solicitor prepared a letter listing
the accusations made against the accountant.
However, Mr Moore allegedly refused to sign it until he had taken
legal advice.
The singer was also questioned about his attitude towards investing
his money. Sting said that after one company into which he ploughed
#150,000 ran into trouble he decided to ''call it a day''.
He said he had since put a large slice of his income into his various
properties. He has homes in Wiltshire, New York, and Los Angeles.
Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, opening the defence, put it to Sting that he
was too busy to control his business.
The singer replied: ''My control is fundamental and it was based on
the bank mandates which I controlled.''
The trial continues.

CORONATION Street star Julie Goodyear left her spot behind the bar at
the Rovers Return after 25 years last night, and nearly departed in a
''blaze of glory''.
A cake presented to the actress -- who played Bet Lynch and latterly
Bet Gilroy -- was decked out with three giant sparklers which set off
smoke alarms and brought three fire appliances rushing to Granada TV's
studios in Manchester where the series is filmed.
A Granada TV spokesman, who attended the send-off champagne party,
said: ''Julie had just said how overwhelmed she was by it all when the
alarms started ringing.''
Firefighters left after being given bottles of champagne by the
programme's stars attending the party to mark Ms Goodyear's departure
from the cast.
Ms Goodyear, 53, leaves the show with Granada's agreement. Coronation
Street producers have decided not to kill her off in the script, leaving
the way open for her return.
Ms Goodyear said before filming yesterday: ''This isn't goodbye, it's
au revoir.
''I could never leave the street for good. It's been great fun. It
would be nice to bob in and out again.''
Ms Goodyear decided to leave the top soap opera in May to look for
other TV work.
She and Granada TV said the split was amicable and there had been no
dispute between them.
The company would not disclose what scenes she had been filming
yesterdaybut it has been reported that the script has her being forced
to quit the pub, after failing to raise enough money to continue the
tenancy, and being succeeded by Jack and Vera Duckworth.
At her leaving party, held in a room at the Granada studios decorated
in her favourite yellow and black, she was presented with 100 yellow
roses by executive producer Carolyn Reynolds.
The cast also gave her a replica model of the Rovers Return.

LABOUR'S battle fleet berthed at Leith yesterday to say goodbye to the
leading stoker who had done so much over the past four decades to keep
the party afloat.
Samuel Joseph McCluskie was laid to rest with a requiem Mass at St
Mary's, Star of the Sea, which he had planned in detail months ahead. He
died last week, aged 63, leaving his wife Alice and a daughter.
However, for seafarers around the world he was a Dreadnought for every
pound of his 20st frame: perhaps the last of the old breed of
charismatic and couthy union leaders, but utterly fearless when pitching
in against bosses to fight for his members.
A major influence in the 1966 seamen's strike, he was also at the
heart of the Labour Party in the 1980s, acting as honest broker between
warring sections as both party chairman and treasurer.
For that reason, all the first lords of the Labour and trade union
movements sailed into his home port to honour his memory. Leader Tony
Blair, his deputy John Prescott, Gordon Brown, George Robertson,
Alistair Darling, Malcolm Chisholm, and Gavin Strang stood alongside
Jimmy Knapp, Mick McGahey, Alex Kitson, and nearly 300 friends from all
quarters, including businessmen Jim Glass and Tom Farmer.
In fact, Big Sam was a ship's cook before becoming a political stoker,
as ex-steward Mr Prescott said in recalling their first meeting on the
National Union of Seamen executive 35 years ago.
In a moving address he detailed his friend's achievements. He was the
man, as a Ruskin trustee, who encouraged the young Prescott to study at
the Oxford trade union college. His influence carried through various
seafarers' charities and the international labour movement.
''Sam was a man of the people, a champion of seafarers and working
people everywhere, and a man who also brought a smile to everyone's face
. . . except the ship-owner,'' Mr Prescott said.
''I loved this man and I will always remember him for his tremendous
sense of humour, his decency, his honesty, and his commitment.''
Mr McCluskie didn't fit in with political correctness. His great
passion, apart from Celtic FC, was greyhounds. He took great delight
last year when his dog Labour Leader won a race sponsored by the Mitcham
and Morden Conservative Association, but he offended some with his trips
to Ireland to follow hare-coursing.
Mr Prescott also recalled a party conference when chairman Sam caused
outrage by referring to women delegates as lassies (the actual word was
''hen''), but that was a result of his upbringing rather than
patronising disrespect.
Big Sam chose the readings and hymns and got all the mourners to sing
The Red Flag. He had ordered the 400 song sheets last December just in
case any of the new boys didn't know the words. The service was followed
by interment at Mount Vernon Cemetery.
There was a drink on him for everyone in the social club afterwards,
lest any mistook his mischief for malice.

THE new deputy governor of the Bank of England, Mr Howard Davies, has
called on the Government to scrap child benefit for higher rate
taxpayers and make wealthy professionals contribute to the costs of
their children's higher education.
Although recorded a month before he took up his post, Mr Davies's
prescription for attacking the growing gap between rich and poor was
given a cautious welcome by Labour as the first sign of a ''social
conscience'' at the heart of Government.
In the second part of a BBC Radio 4 series, Letters from the
Boardroom, due to be broadcast this morning, Mr Davies sets out the need
to fund better education and training. To pay for it, he asks: ''Should
higher rate tax payers receive child benefit, for example?
''Should wealthy professional people receive grants for their student
offspring? Perhaps, as many millions do in the United States, they
should cough up something towards tuition fees?''
His intervention in a policy area not normally considered part of the
deputy governor's brief was defended by the bank yesterday as a personal
view expressed before he moved into Threadneedle Street last week.
However, Mr Donald Dewar, Shadow Social Security Secretary, called on
Mr Davies to continue pressing his views as deputy governor: ''I very
much hope that he takes his concern about growing inequality with him to
the Bank of England. A social conscience so conspicuously missing in
Government will be welcome there.''
Mr Davies proposed two measures to address the wealth gap, which he
described as the most serious social issue facing the country: greater
investment in training and education and an expanded use of in-work
benefits to allow people to gain on-the-job training.
He suggested Family Credit for families with children should be
extended to reduce the social cost to employers and provide incentive to
those reluctant to take a job that might offer less money than the
benefits available for remaining unemployed.
Mr Davies said: ''Part of the nervousness about going further is a
fear that employers, cowboy employers, would pay less and less, and
allow social security to make up the difference. That hasn't happened so
far, because in-work benefits have been confined to just a few people,
with children.
''If it did happen, then the Government would need to consider a
minimum wage, set at a low level to prevent exploitation (of the
Government, rather than the individual). But that would be very much a
last resort.''

THE Princess of Wales appears to be stepping up her public engagements
at home and abroad.
The princess, who almost two years ago announced she wanted to retreat
from the media spotlight, is now increasingly taking centre stage.
Her latest high-profile date is a charity dinner at the New York
Hilton hotel.
She will fly to New York in December to support an evening in aid of
cerebral palsy sufferers, a concern close to her heart.
The princess will receive an award from the United Cerebral Palsy
Association of America in recognition of her support and work for
related charities.
It will be a happier occasion than the last time Diana was in America,
when she flew to comfort her close friend Lucia Flecha de Lima, whose
husband Paolo, Brazilian ambassador to the United States, suffered a
brain haemorrhage.
The transatlantic trip follows a visit to Italy last week when the
princess was guest of honour at a charity concert for the traumatised
children of war-torn Bosnia, given by opera star Luciano Pavarotti.
Next Monday, the princess flies to Paris to view an exhibition of
paintings by French Impressionist Cezanne and attend a fundraising
dinner in aid of London's Great Ormond Street children's hospital.
On Wednesday next week, she will present the Literary Review annual
poetry prize at The Cafe Royal in London's West End.
A third engagement next week sees the princess, an Honorary Air
Commodore, visiting RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire.
In October, she will attend the London film premiere of Haunted in aid
of the European Anorexia Trust and as vice-president of the British Red
Cross Society.
Five days later, the princess will open the National Institute of
Conductive Education at Moseley, Birmingham, linked to her work with
children suffering from cerebral palsy.
Early in December, as patron, she will open the English National
Ballet School in London, before travelling to New York.
Since December 1993, when she appealed for time to reassess her public
life, the princess has gradually increased her number of official
engagements.

TOMORROW is a special occasion for sports car enthusiasts, when the
new MGF two-seater, unveiled in March at the Geneva Motor Show, finally
goes on sale.
Apart from the special edition ''retro'' RV8, the last sports car to
wear the historic octagon badge was the MGB, which went out of
production in 1980.
There have been competition-only MGs in the past, such as the K3
Magnette with which Tazio Nuvolari won the Tourist Trophy race in 1933,
and the super-streamlined record breakers driven by such notable pilots
as Goldie Gardner, Stirling Moss, and Phil Hill.
However, the main theme of MG design since the 1920s has been to
provide affordable sports cars for people who could use them for
commuting and for activities at the weekend.
At a showroom price of #15,995, the first model in the new range is
the 120bhp MGF 1.8i. Later in the year, it will be joined by the
higher-performance VVC model, whose variable valve control system boosts
the power output to 145bhp and the price to #17,995.
The MGF is the most advanced volume production car MG, now part of the
Rover Group, has put on the market.
The variable valve control arrangement and electrically operated power
steering on the VVC model are unique. The mid-engined layout is often
seen in far more expensive GT cars and this is the only sports car in
the world with the fore-and-aft linked Hydragas suspension developed
more than 30 years by Dr Alex Moulton.
The striking bodywork and interior were refined by Rover's design
team, which was headed, until a few weeks ago, by Mr Gordon Sked. The
Dollar Academy-educated designer, having completed 25 years with the
company, has left to form his own consultancy.
Rover has invested almost #200m in engine work, enlarging the highly
regarded K-series power unit, first seen in 1989, to a 1796cc capacity.
The MGF programme was tackled, by industry standards, at a brisk pace,
with the exercise starting from a clean sheet of paper just four years
ago.
For reasons which were never really clear, successive managements at
Morris, BMC, and British Leyland, which all fell heir to MG, repeatedly
starved the sports car branch of investment and perversely denied it the
ability to market up-to-date designs.
The MGF is being tackled in a much more confident and businesslike
way. Home and export orders are already substantial.
A specialised dealer network has been established at home and abroad.
The Japanese importer alone has suggested that he could easily sell the
whole of the factory's first-year production, which he will not, of
course, be allowed to do.

EXCLUSIVE
THE SNP is lining up one of its most charismatic figures of the 1970s
to contest the seat he wrested from Labour in a famous by-election
victory more than 20 years ago.
Mr George Reid, the former broadcaster who won Clackmannan and East
Stirling in 1974, has worked abroad for the International Red Cross for
10 years. He revealed yesterday that following informal approaches he
was prepared to put himself forward once more in the constituency.
He emphasised there were a number of procedures to go through but
these would begin tomorrow when he submitted himself to the SNP's
election committee which considers the eligibility for those being
brought on to the candidates' list.
This opens up the intriguing possibility that Mr Reid could challenge
Labour incumbent Martin O'Neill, whose Clackmannan seat is altered by
boundary changes at the next General Election.
The SNP has been assiduously promoting the idea that its electoral
success will spread south and west from its current heartlands.
The strong SNP enclave of Kinross comes into the re-drawn Ochils
constituency which it is believed Mr Reid could be invited to contest.
He is to give a lecture tomorrow on the theme of Home Thoughts from
Abroad, looking at his experience of working for the International Red
Cross.
Placing himself firmly on the wing of the SNP which would seek to use
a devolved parliament as a route to full independence, he said: ''What
has impressed me abroad is the way people make common cause and bury
their differences, realising that the central state is the problem.''
Mr Reid, who served at Westminster from 1974 to 1979, has maintained a
home in Bridge of Allan, his wife's home town, which comes into the
re-drawn constituency.
Last night, Mr Michael Russell, SNP chief executive, said: ''I am sure
that George would be well received in a number of constituencies who
would be more than interested in having the services of someone with
such experience and enthusiasm.''

<HEADLINE>Deal ends doctors' disruption threat.   Dorrell promises advertising campaign to discourage growing number of time-wasting night calls.</HEADLINE>

THE prospect of industrial action by general practitioners was averted
yesterday when doctors reached agreement with Health Secretary Stephen
Dorrell on a package of measures, including the launch of an official
campaign to persuade people to think twice before calling their doctor
out at night.
However, a top advertising executive warned that such a campaign would
have to be handled sensitively and could backfire if patients were
discouraged from seeking urgent help that they genuinely needed.
The British Medical Association's GP committee unanimously accepted
the package, aimed at easing the burden of out-of-hours work and solving
the most pressing problem Mr Dorrell inherited from his predecessor, Mrs
Virginia Bottomley.
That leaves GPs still responsible for their patients 24 hours a day --
a matter left for further negotiation -- but they will be able to
transfer this to other doctors, for example locums or deputising
services, for nights and weekends with health board approval.
Nor has the money on the table changed significantly -- the BMA has
maintained that the dispute was ''not about money''.
The major factor in the settlement was Mr Dorrell's agreement to fund
a huge public education campaign on the lines of the Patients' Charter,
designed to dissuade people from making time-wasting calls to doctors.
As a result, the committee accepted the deal without the need for a
ballot of members, who had agreed to a programme of industrial action
failing a satisfactory outcome.
This was to have avoided harming patients but the GPs had a list of 20
measures aimed at undermining NHS bureaucracy -- what one member called
''pouring marmalade into the system''.
According to the BMA, there has been a doubling in the number of
out-of-hours calls (defined as from 7pm to 8am on weekdays and 1pm on
Saturdays to 8am the following Monday) in the past three years. Also,
the number of night visits made by doctors has increased from 682,000 in
1983-84 to 1,643,000 in 1992-93.
There has been a growing exasperation on the part of doctors that many
of these calls are frivolous and could easily wait for a normal surgery
appointment. As a result, say the doctors, they turn up for daily
surgery washed out because of interrupted sleep.
However, a Scottish advertising executive with wide experience in the
public education field said the campaign would be a long, complicated
process.
''If you are trying to change attitudes and habits you have to design
advertising that explains the new procedures clearly in a way that is
favourable,'' he pointed out.
''The main challenge is that if somebody is ill during the night,
advertising is going to have a limited effect. Your first priority is
you and your family's health.
''It will be a tough job. It can be done, if you think of seat belts,
drinking and driving, and smoke alarms. Advertising changed attitudes
and behaviour.
''You have to remember that if you are going to say to the public that
you are going to change their habits, they are going to ask why. What's
in it for them?
''So you have to get across that it will mean a better service and
that those genuinely in need will find it easier to get attention. But a
degree of sensitivity is required. You don't want to persuade the truly
ill from seeking treatment.''
The GPs had previously rejected an offer that would have replaced
their current #47 per home visit at night with an annual payment of
#2000 and #20 a visit.
That has now been accepted, as has the #45m on offer to develop
alternative ways of providing general practice services, with the
proviso that it is to be distributed equitably.
Dr Brian Potter, the Scottish secretary of the BMA, welcomed the fact
that Mr Dorrell had responded to the GPs' legitimate anxieties, adding:
''There has been a welcome change in attitude from three months ago.
''This deal clears the deck so that we can advance discussion on the
morale, recruitment, and retention crisis facing general practice.''

A CAMPAIGN has been launched to prevent the Forestry Commission
selling more than 9000 acres in the constituency of Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang.
Instead, the campaigners, led by former Forestry Commission
Conservator, Mr John Davies, want investment increased in the Galloway
and Upper Nithsdale area with a view to creating employment.
Mr Davies, 72, as conservator, was responsible for tens of thousands
of acres of woodland on behalf of the commission. Now he is accusing his
former masters of ''chasing the fast buck'' and failing to prepare for
the future.
While the Forestry Commission insists no decision has been made, Mr
Davies is adamant it plans to go ahead and has called on Mr Lang to
speak up on the issue.
He said: ''I have letters from the chairman, Sir Peter Hutchison,
which make it clear that this woodland will be sold off just as soon as
possible.''
The campaign has the backing of the Duke of Buccleuch and various
bodies, including the Red Deer Commission and the Ramblers' Association,
which fears access to a large section of the Southern Upland Way may be
threatened.
Mr Davies is a fierce critic of the disposal programme being
undertaken by the commission, despite the fact the Government has
decided the commission itself should remain in public hands.
He said: ''What is the point of keeping the commission in public hands
if you are then going to get rid of your finest assets and neglect the
rest? It is back-door privatisation of the most naked kind and it is
continuing apace.''
He warns that a chance to create employment is being lost: ''We had
Ian Lang visiting the area a couple of weeks ago and saying how
concerned he is that unemployment in some areas is touching 25%. How
concerned can he be when, as Secretary of State for Scotland, he allowed
the commission to embark on this crazy programme of disposals.
''I am an old-fashioned one- nation Tory but I fear I will be looking
for someone else to support next time if Ian Lang remains silent on this
vital issue. And I will not be the only one.''
Mr Davies says that private owners may not only threaten employment
and access but may also fail to protect rare flora and fauna.
He continued: ''We will make our voices heard and if we cannot
persuade them then maybe the voice of big customers like Caledonian
Paper at Irvine, who are dead against privatisation of forestry, will
play their part.''
Mr David Baker, of Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise, said: ''Forestry
is vital to the economy of this area, as some 25% of Scotland's forest
cover is here. I will be looking at the possible implications of this
situation.''
A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said a sale is only ''under
consideration''. He added: ''We put notices in the Estates Gazette to
the effect that we are considering certain disposals as part of our
ongoing programme. That is not to say that any one piece of woodland
will ultimately be sold.''

CAMPAIGNERS behind a plan to double Scotland's areas of native
woodland by the year 2000 are to hear within the next few days about
Millennium Commission funding.
Millennium Forest for Scotland comprises a heavyweight body of
agencies, including WWF Scotland, the National Trust for Scotland, Royal
Scottish Forestry Society, the RSPB, and Scottish Heritage, with
Scottish Enterprise in an advisory role.
The campaign steering group is well on its way to raising 50,000
signatures to a nationwide petition backing the call to give Scotland
back its natural forests.
At present only 4% of original forests remains. Now this situation
appears set to change radically.
A WWF spokesman confirmed yesterday that the group expects to hear
from the Millennium Commission next week.
''It would signal a new era involving hundreds of woodland educational
and tourism projects up and down the country,'' he said.
The forest campaign involves a #100m initiative over a five-year
period.
It is designed to rediscover the place of native woods in the nation's
life through landscape improvements and artistic and cultural projects,
together with innovative development of woodland products.
Meanwhile, young people are being targeted by a Scottish Natural
Heritage initiative, launched yesterday by Lord Lindsay, Scotland's
Environment Minister.
He said a series of education programmes would be launched, designed
to give individuals the opportunity to learn more about their
environment.
''In Scotland we have set the agenda for environmental education in
ambitious yet realistic terms. We now need to project the benefits of
environmental education to a wider audience.''

COMPLETE expulsion as a means of curtailing the soaring number of
children being excluded from schools was advocated yesterday by head
teachers.
The total of exclusions has at least tripled in Britain in the last
three years, since full powers to expel were ended. The figure reached
10,000 children last year, some of them as young as four.
Head teachers agree that too many children are being excluded but they
blame the Government for abolishing their powers of indefinite
exclusion.
Fixed-term exclusions of a maximum 15 days per term do not allow time
to resolve problems violent disruptive children present to schools, they
say.
The National Association of Head Teachers said in a policy paper
yesterday that the only option left in many cases was to exclude a child
for good.
General secretary David Hart said the Government could not delay
action ''to reverse the impression that it is more concerned with
sweeping the problem under the carpet than with providing heads with a
full range of appropriate sanctions''.
He added: ''It will send a clear message to the minority of parents
who have abdicated their responsibilities that they are potentially
ruining the lives of their own children by their feckless behaviour.''
The union says growing numbers of children start school neglected and
with few social skills -- never having been taught the meaning of the
word ''no''.
The heads want to be able to override parental rights of appeal
against expulsion which can result in violent children being sent
straight back to schools which are unable to cope with them.

than #4000 damages against the police.
The incident took place in November 1991 and the ruling led to calls
for a change in the police complaints procedure from the Labour Party
and the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties.
Strathclyde's deputy chief constable James Richardson said last night
a 34-year-old constable had been suspended from duty.
Mr Anwar, 27, sued the chief constable for #15,000 in Scotland's first
civil action alleging a racist attack by police after his formal
complaint to the police failed.
Yesterday, in a written judgment, Sheriff George Evans awarded him
#4200, following the action at Glasgow Sheriff Court five months ago.
During the hearing, the court was told that Mr Anwar, an activist at
Glasgow University at the time, was arrested while illegally fly-posting
bills for a demonstration on student poverty due to be held the
following day.
He was chased and caught by Police Constable Graham McKee, who landed
on top of him.
In his judgment, Sheriff Evans found that Constable McKee had
deliberately assaulted Mr Anwar ''by pulling his head back and slamming
the bottom part of his face straight down on to the ground''.
As a result, Mr Anwar's two front teeth were chipped. PC McKee
repeated the action.
The sheriff said evidence from an independent witness that the officer
was taunting Mr Anwar tied in with what Mr Anwar said and reinforced the
impression of PC McKee showing racial bias and having made the remark
''this is what happens to black boys with big mouths''.
Mr Anwar, who now lives in Liverpool, had to take liquid food through
a straw, took to drink, missed lectures and tutorials, and lost over a
stone and a half in weight. He suffered from stress and panic attacks
and had nightmares and mood changes.
Sheriff Evans said the attack was an ''intentional wrong''.
He said Mr Anwar was entitled to damages but pointed out that
allegations of racism did not influence his findings.
''Mr Anwar has been categorised in press releases on his behalf as
'the young victim of racist violence by members of Strathclyde Police,
forced to rely on himself for bringing the offending parties to trial'
as though there was something unusual about an individual raising a
civil action to enforce his rights.
''This type of loaded confrontational material serves no good purpose
and has not influenced the outcome of the action in any way.''
He said the police evidence gave the impression of being ''stilted and
guarded'' and was ''too pat and with a false ring of injured surprise at
the scenario being put to them in cross examination.''
Mr Anwar said: ''I am delighted and very satisfied with the decision.
I only ever wanted justice and hope this sort of thing never happens
again.''
Ms Carole Ewart, director of the SCCL, said: ''We shall be calling for
a immediate review of the police complaints procedure in Scotland.''
Labour's Scottish Home Affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, said:
''There is no doubt that a case like this shakes the public's confidence
in the police force.''
He said that although he was not suggesting this particular complaint
was not investigated properly, there should be an independent element in
police investigation procedures.

<HEADLINE>Officials condemn inquiry. Monklands hits back at Black</HEADLINE>

THE inquiry by Professor Robert Black into claims of nepotism and
spending bias in Monklands has been condemned as inaccurate and
misleading by council officials.
After examining the Black Report, which the council itself
commissioned, they said it was seriously deficient in factual evidence.
In one instance, they have asserted that Professor Black's reporting
of a particular item ''could hardly be more inaccurate''.
Endorsing their officials' response to the report, council leaders
have expressed regret that Professor Black had felt unable to meet them
to discuss his inquiry.
In his report published last June, Professor Black found:
* Allegations of illegal conduct which he had passed on to the Crown
Office.
* A spending gap on major projects between Catholic Coatbridge and
Protestant Airdrie.
* Nepotism in the recruitment policies of Monklands, with 16 out of 21
councillors having relations, some of them close relations, working for
the council.
* Religious favouritism but only in the context of nepotism, rather
than for sectarian reasons.
According to the Monklands response, a number of the allegations
specified in Professor Black's report were either misleading, untrue or
otherwise totally unsupported by any reliable evidence.
Referring to Professor Black's claim that all allegations used as
examples in the report had been independently investigated ''where
possible'', the Monklands officials feel it reasonable to assume there
had been instances of allegations where independent investigation had
not proved possible.
They assert: ''Sources which may have been thought by the inquiry to
be reliable were in fact unreliable.''
On the issue of spending bias, officials claim there is broad parity
in general services expenditure between Coatbridge (#3.3m) and Airdrie
(#3.5m), if strategic projects worth #25.4m are excluded. These include
the Time Capsule Monklands, Coatbridge town centre (The Quadrant),
Summerlee Heritage Park, Drumpellier Country Park, industrial units,
administrative offices, and a refuse disposal site.
The officials claim a section on allegations on favouritism contains
''glaring inaccuracies'': stating that in one particular instance
relating to a car user's allowance ''the reporting of this item could
hardly be more inaccurate.''
In addition, the conclusion that preferential treatment was accorded
to councillors in relations to house repairs ''could be shown to be
false''.
However, the Monklands response does not comment on the employment of
councillors' relatives, because these matters ''may be the subject of
further investigation''.
Following the furore created by the Black Report, the Scottish Office
announced it was to mount an investigation to be headed by Sheriff Nimmo
Smith.
The council's Labour leader, Councillor Jim Brooks, commented last
night: ''They want to further inquire into the inquiry that the inquiry
was about. We've had more inquiries out here than they had for the
Torrey Canyon disaster.
''Our officials were instructed to go away and find the facts.
However, I didn't see the Black Report as the horrendous report it was
made out to be. A lot of people grabbed at it but it didn't in my view
come up with anything serious.''
However, he did condemn the secrecy of some of the proceedings which
led to ''hearsay'' being presented as evidence.
Councillor Neil Douglas, leader of the three SNP members of the
council, said it was disgraceful that the Labour administration should
be seeking to ''rubbish'' Professor Black, who was one of the finest
legal minds in the country.
Councillor Douglas declared: ''It's disgraceful what is going on. The
much-vaunted inquiry by the Labour Party hasn't even got under way, yet
this administration attacks the Black Report. They should all resign.''
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said last night
the Labour Party was carrying out its own inquiry ''as quickly as
possible''.
He said: ''The council is entitled to its opinion. In the absence of
the Secretary of State taking action it financed the inquiry which was
wholly independent.
''The councillors are entitled to express their opinion about the
document and other people are entitled to come to their considered
conclusions as well.''

FIVE men arrested in connection with the murder of schoolgirl Naomi
Smith were being questioned by police last night.
The officers were interviewing a further 33 people -- who had not been
arrested -- in their hunt for the killer of 15-year-old Naomi, whose
body was found in a recreation ground near her home in Nuneaton,
Warwickshire, last week.
The five arrested were all thought to be local men, in their early
20s, who live within a mile of Naomi's home.
The interviews continued as the community of Ansley Common held a
memorial service near where her body was found.
Around 250 people stood in a solemn semi-circle on the barren playing
field with Naomi's parents, Brian and Catherine, her brothers, and other
family members.
The family sat by the wooden children's slide beneath which her father
and her best friend Emma Jones discovered Naomi's body.
Earlier, a woman whose son was taken away by 12 officers in an
early-morning raid on the family home said he had contacted police on
Monday after hearing rumours that he was a suspect.
Janet Carter-Houndslow, of Ansley Common Road, said her 24-year-old
son Darren had been at home for several days with flu.
''The police called this morning and I shouted up to him in bed and he
came down. I have spoken to him today and he just said to me, 'Don't
worry, mum'. I am sure he will be home soon.''
About 80 detectives and other officers from the Warwickshire force
were involved in the swoop on addresses in the Nuneaton area.
Mrs Carter-Houndslow said her daughter Fay, 16, who had been a fellow
pupil of Naomi, and Darren had several friends in the area of the
''rec'' where Naomi's body was discovered.
Detectives have said Naomi's throat was cut and she was sexually
mutilated in the attack. They are still looking for a knife and a
baseball bat used in the killing.
