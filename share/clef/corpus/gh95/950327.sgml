THIS will be a weekend the Menzieshill captain, 22-year-old student
Bobby Storrie, will want to forget.
Last Thursday his car was broken into and his notes for his degree
project were stolen, on Saturday he had to endure a 0-4 defeat by
arch-rivals MIM in the Torrie Stockbrokers National League, and then
yesterday he was again powerless to prevent his side going out of the
Scottish Cup against Western.
Menzieshill had only two efforts on target while Western, with the
greater share of the pressure, were no more successful in the shooting
circle.
In the penalty shootout, following a scoreless draw, Western found
their bearings to win 4-2 with Steven Menzies, Joyce, Neil Menzies, and
captain Roddy Philp making the conversion to put them through to the
final for the second successive year.
In the first division of the league it was status quo, with leaders
Grange and MIM both registering 4-0 victories. Clydesdale, after
whipping Devol Greenock 9-0, are effectively the second-division
champions.
Ellon Gordon are similarly placed in division five.
The Four Nations Youth Tournaments in Newport, Wales, were a source of
great disappointment.
Scotland's only victory came in the under-18 event when they beat
Wales 5-1. Results:
Saturday: Torrie Stockbrokers National League. Division 1 -- Insights
Inverleith 0, Grange 4; Menzieshill 0, MIM 4; Western 1, Torbrex

ONE MAN'S MISSION TO SEEK OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE PAST AND BUILD A
BETTER FUTURE
A serviceman exposed to radiation
during British nuclear tests in the
Pacific in the 50s has been
carrying out his own investigation
on Christmas Island. But, as
George Hume reports, John Leuchars
has not gone back empty-handed
Happier returns: the people of Christmas Island have good reason to be
grateful for the tenacity and compassion of John Leuchars, one of the
unwitting guinea pigs in Britain's nuclear experiments in the Pacific.
WHEN John Leuchars visited friends he had made almost 40 years ago as
a young National Serviceman they treated him just like a member of the
family, built him a house, gave him a half-coconut as a tooth mug and
provided a canoe-shaped section of old lorry tyre to serve as a bath.
So much did he enjoy his trip that John, a Dundonian, went back last
Christmas and next month heads south once more, bearing gifts -- several
thousand books, a portable generator, and hundreds of pairs of reading
glasses. Single-handed he is bringing the written word to Christmas
Island -- the world's largest atoll, one of the most remote communities
on earth.
Now aged 58, John Leuchars first went to Christmas Island in 1956 as a
sapper in the Royal Engineers, one of the 1400 troops -- mainly National
Servicemen -- who were sent to the Pacific for Britain's nuclear bomb
trials. Thirty-seven of them were taken by landing craft to Malden
Island, 400 miles south of Christmas Island, to set up the bomb and,
from just 24 miles off-shore, see it detonated.
''We were lined up on deck -- no short trousers, no short-sleeved
shirts allowed -- and told not to look until one-and-a-half minutes
after the blast. But we could feel the tremendous heat. When we did turn
round we couldn't look at the brightness, it was too intense. The sky
was orange, blue, green -- and then the mushroom cloud went up. We were
closed up below deck after that with all the vents specially sealed and
these were the worst four hours of my life. The heat was awful -- sweat
just poured out of us.''
During the four hours and 20 minutes that John Leuchars and his fellow
Royal Engineers were held in their mess -- large bowls of fruit were
provided -- the landing craft made its way back to Malden Island. ''We
were put ashore for five or six hours to recover some machines that had
been put in specially-protected Nissen huts. The island was on fire . .
. wood, scrub, everything. We were jubilant, it was the excitement of
the time and, being just young lads, we thought it was all a bit of a
giggle.
''We had each been given a radiation badge to measure our exposure and
had to throw them into a shoe-box as we drove back on board. I don't
know if mine went in or not but I do know of one lad who brought his
back as a souvenir and it is in his mother's house yet. There didn't
seem to be any real check.
''I remember that when we were given the radiation badges we were told
'if it changes colour, report sick' and inevitably someone added the
jokey line 'or dead'. But, you know, I have never been able to trace any
of the 36 lads who were out there with me on that trip to Malden Island
and one asks the obvious questions.''
John Leuchars describes Government evidence he has heard regarding the
movement of men on and off Malden Island after the A-bomb blast as
''bunkum'' and ''porkies''.
Their job done, the landing craft returned to Christmas Island. What
took John Leuchars back there in middle age was his dissatisfaction with
what he heard from government witnesses during recent civil court
actions raised by former soldiers present at the nuclear test programme
in the Pacific and now claiming ill-health as a result.
''I was subpoenad as a witness two or three times, was not pleased
with the government evidence I heard, and decided to do my own research.
I put an advert in the region's largest newspaper, the Tarawa Times,
with an old photograph of me as a soldier on Christmas Island. Three
months later a letter arrived from a friend I had made out there all
these years ago -- Moantua Teia. He is just two months older than me and
were good chums. More letters followed and he kept asking ''when are you
coming down?'' I decided to go -- that was April last year -- and with
his birthday coming up I asked what he might like as a present.
''His son told me -- 'reading glasses'. There is a tremendous shortage
of these on Christmas Island so I collected as many as I could, around
500 pairs altogether, and sent them off in a tea chest. When I followed
on I was treated as an honoured guest. A house had been specially built
for me -- their houses have only a roof and a floor, no walls necessary
as it is about 85 degrees even in winter -- and I stayed for a month
using a scooped-out half coconut to clean my teeth, a slice of old lorry
tyre as a bath and my bath water as a mirror. Simple living.''
The 2400 islanders, John Leuchars discovered, had no library and few
books on which to use their recently arrived spectacles. Back in Britain
-- he lives in the Manchester area now -- he set about filling the gap.
With around 1600 books in hand it was back to Christmas Island at,
appropriately, Christmas and there the Dundee crane driver whom the
islanders now think of as one of their own set about refurbishing an old
army mess hall as a library -- new floor, shelves and a reading room.
A grand-daughter of his friend Moantua Teia -- born the day that John
Leuchars set off on his second trip to Christmas Island -- was named in
honour of his wife, Dorothy. ''I'm getting like a local. They are all
extremely friendly and simply cannot do enough. It is always a big meal
and they never seem to know how many will be there. The special guests
and hosts dine first and then the dishes are passed over to the women,
children and lesser men. I have always been one of the guests of honour
-- they simply seem delighted that I want to live among them.''
No part of Christmas Island is more than 12ft above sea level and when
he is at his second home John Leuchars goes everywhere on a bicycle . .
. ''everywhere'' being the three main villages of London (the capital),
Tabakea, and Banana. The cultivation and export of coconuts is the
economic mainstay of the island but, says John Leuchars, the pace of
life is easy and money is not a big issue.
''The people eat well -- a lot of pork and fish, coconuts and
breadfruit -- but by our standards they are poor. Five pence a day, for
example, is the cost of primary education. But they are very happy and
enjoy a strong sense of community. On Christmas Day everybody sang and
on Boxing Day they danced. When it came to New Year's Day -- that was
devoted to the elderly. Folk just visit when they want and many stay the
night -- just lie down on a mat they have brought, put their cheek on
their tobacco tin, and fall asleep.''
Even as John Leuchars prepares to set off for Christmas Island again
this month -- Dorothy may go with him but has so far not declared -- the
books keep coming in, including an entire library from a stately home.
His own house now full to the brim, they are being stored in the
basement of a nearby nursing home.
''It will have to be an entire ship-board container this time. My
chums among the nuclear vets are ferrying books here from all over the
country and there are more spectacles and even a generator to go down
this time as well. I will have to extend the library building, really,
it is becoming a bit like long-distance commuting.''

The new unitary authorities offer councils the chance to clean the
slate. ALAN ALEXANDER, Professor of Local and Public Management at
Strathclyde University's Business School, chalks up a fewer pointers
which they can aim to achieve.
THE imminent changes to the Scottish local government system have been
controversial, vehemently opposed by all parties except the
Conservatives, and have to be implemented on a timetable foreshortened
by the campaign of non-co-operation.
But the elections on April 6 are a watershed, the point at which even
the most implacable opponents must accept the inevitability of change.
New councillors, and the officials they appoint, will have to look
forward rather than back. So what prospects for change are opened up by
the transition to the new unitary councils?
There will, inevitably, be a lot of short-term pressure, as the new
authorities get organised and the existing councils ensure the
continuity of services while organising the transfer of staff and
responsibilities.
Managers and professionals will find themselves doing more jobs than
one, as they cover for colleagues who have moved to positions in the new
councils.
Many councillors will spend a year serving on two or even three
councils. But, as the shadow year goes on, their priority will be the
meetings at which the new authorities construct tightly-constrained
budgets, appoint key staff and, next March, set a council tax for their
first fully operational year.
There will be many long-term opportunities. Unitary councils offer the
advantage of simplicity and accessibility, as the public comes to
realise that the responsibility for planning all local services, but not
necessarily for their direct delivery, lies with one council rather than
two.
They also provide an opportunity for the coherent planning of services
across departmental and professional boundaries. The dividing lines
between housing and social services and education and planning mean a
lot more to providers than consumers of these services.
A unitary structure offers the possibility of an approach to community
services which is at once more comprehensive and more responsive than is
possible in a two-tier structure.
But that possibility will become a reality only if the new councils
are clear about their strategy and objectives for the communities they
serve.
That clarity will be established only if the change to a new system is
seized as an opportunity to redefine the relationship between
politicians and professionals in a way that ensures that the community
gets the best out of both. Any approach which sees reorganisation as
being only about boundaries and structures will miss that opportunity.
Local government is a democratic system, in which those directly
elected by the public take responsibility for policy and strategy, and
the officials they employ ensure that the processes of implementation
are capable of delivering the services specified by the strategy.
But innovations, such as the introduction of competitive tendering,
the devolving of education budgets to schools, care in the community and
tenants' choice in housing, have ensured that implementation and
delivery are not entirely under the control of elected members.
This means that they have to ensure that their strategic vision is
robust enough, and clear enough, to encompass agencies (such as schools,
health boards, and housing associations) over which they have partial
control at best.
It means that they need to trust good managers and committed
professionals to get on with the job of reaching their clearly specified
objectives.
Historically, though not universally, councillors in Scotland have
been too closely involved in management and implementation.
Often, managers and professionals have been content to accept a
relationship which prevents them from offering the best advice on the
development of innovations in service delivery, and quality and
improvements in the monitoring and accountability of service provision.
Reorganisation offers the chance to create a constructive
relationship, that responds to the complexity of a local public sector
in which the council is the most legitimate player, often the biggest
player, but never the only player.
Councillors need to reduce the amount of time they spend in committees
and increase the amount of time they spend in monitoring services in the
community.
They need to take the advice of officers on how they can ensure that
the reactions that they find in communities are fed back into the
process of policy making and service design.
Officers and members need to accept that the most productive policy
making takes place not in the formal setting of the committee but in the
informal meetings of officer-member working groups, where the power of
the political imperative is tested by professional and managerial
expertise in implementation and achievability.
None of this will be possible, if the new councils rush headlong into
too rapid an appointment of chief executives, or if they decide to
create committee systems that maximise the number of chairs, rather than
optimise the process of policy making.
The requirement to produce a decentralisation plan within a year of
taking over offers an opportunity to councils to review rigorously the
pattern of their services and their relationship with the public.
If they use it imaginatively, it could help to specify the kind of
management and decision-making processes they need to deliver the kind
of services that communities want.
They will have to approach the question of decentralisation with minds
open to change, and in a spirit of openness that does not see the
process of service design as the exclusive preserve of the council.
Decentralisation can encompass processes of accountability and
participation in policy review, as well as ensuring that people in
remote areas have access to council officials and members.
But, if there are long-term opportunities, there are also long-term
dangers. The abolition of the big regions removes from much of Scotland
the valuable economies of scale that big institutions and big budgets
bring.
There is no doubt that some small scale, but immensely valuable
community projects, are put at risk by the changes, if only because
expenditure that is modest in a big budget becomes a major expenditure
line in another.
Also, the capacity of the big authorities to innovate, especially in
specialised areas and on behalf of a broader constituency than that for
which they are directly responsible, will be at risk.
There is a danger that the unitary authorities, devoted to their
new-found independence, will set their face against the kind of joint
and co-operative approach that would ensure continuity in narrow, but
crucially important fields, especially in social work and education.
So, as the transition begins, what should be the key aims for the new
councils?
First, to ensure continuity of service through the reorganisation
process.
Second, to regard any decisions on management and decision-making
structure made over the next year as provisional and subject to review
as the new council actually take over the running of services.
Finally, to ensure that services are accessible to the public and
decision-making processes are open and genuinely accountable.

In Florida
NO US Open has been staged in Florida, until this week, of course,
when the spirit of the USGA seized the Players' Championship, the
biggest event on the US PGA Tour.
So it was fitting that a US Open champion won the event yesterday, as
Lee Janzen shot a one-under-par round of 71 to finish at five under par,
winning the fifth title of his career by a stroke from Bernhard Langer,
and by two over Payne Stewart, Corey Pavin, and Gene Sauers.
The leaderboard would have done any US Open proud, full of fine
players, many of whom came with at least one major title, and none of
them very deep into red numbers.
The lead after Thursday's first round was six under par, the lead for
every other round afterwards had backed up to five under par.
After three days of wind, the Sawgrass course had calm conditions
yesterday, a fact that the players seemed to ignore as wayward shot
followed wayward shot and everyone spent the day scrambling.
This was due to greens that were watered just enough to keep them
alive and pin positions that were difficult to get near. On Saturday
just two players were able to break 70, Mike Heinen, with 67, and
Janzen, whose 69 seemed a veritable Arnold Palmer charge up the
leaderboard.
Janzen was not charging yesterday, just making steady progress, with
three birdies and two bogeys, and a lot of good scrambles for par,
particularly on the final two holes.
Langer said after Saturday's round that he believed that any score
under par would win the trophy, the $540,000 first prize, and the
10-year US Tour playing exemption.
A 71 would have won it for the German, it did for Janzen.
Said Langer prior to the final round: ''Patience is the key every day.
You have to think your way around here. It is not the type of golf
course where you just take the driver and blast away and find it and hit
it again.
''It is more positioning the ball, and thinking your way around. The
other thing is that the short game comes in even more on a course like
this than on some other courses. Fortunately, that is one of the
stronger parts of my game.''
Langer needed that patience from the first hole of the final round as
he would bogey and start an uncharacteristic roller-coaster ride around
the golf course.
He had a few good holes, including the twelfth, where he struck an
iron to a foot, and the ninth, where he sank a 40-footer for birdie. But
there were badly played hoels as well, most notably the fourteenth, in
which he went into a bunker and then three-putted for double bogey.
Langer's count for the day was six birdies, five bogeys, and a double
bogey. One of the few pars he did get, at the par-5 eleventh, was
somewhat tainted by controversy about whether or not he took a
favourable, but wrong, drop.
A few spectators booed as he exited the green after having made an
18-foot putt for par. Langer's drop was not illegal, however, because he
got the consent of both playing partner, Pavin and a PGA Tour rules
official.Final scores (All players US unless noted):
283 -- L Janzen 69, 74, 69, 71.
284 -- B Langer (Germany) 69, 71, 71, 73.

SONY has entered the bidding for MGM cinemas, Britain's largest film
house chain, with a #200m offer, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Sony's interests span consumer electronics, music, films and
television. The Japan-based company's main UK operation is a television
plant in South Wales.
MGM has been placed on the market by its owners the loss-making French
bank Credit Lyonnais and has attracted the attention of several
high-profile media groups.
Other interested parties include a consortium headed by Richard
Branson's Virgin Group which has offered #50m less than Sony and a
consortium of Carlton Communications and Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank.
Although the Rank Organisation is closely monitoring the situation it
could face monopoly problems because of its ownership of the rival Odeon
cinema chain.
Merchant bank S G Warburg is handling the sale and has shortlisted a
handful of potential bidders who have been given six weeks to scrutinise
MGM's accounts. Credit Lyonnais is hoping to sell MGM by the summer.
Trips to the movies have increased in popularity in recent years
helped by investment in attractive multi-screen cinemas and the release
of popular films. Recently these have included Four Weddings and a
Funeral, the Lion King and Pulp Fiction.

SCOTLAND centre Gregor Townsend, who injured his left knee during
Gala's match against Hawick on Saturday, will not know until later this
week how serious the injury is. The initial diagnosis was that the
cruciate ligament had been damaged and the knee, which is the same one
operated on last summer for tendon damage, was strapped to allow him to
take a few days' holiday in Ireland.
Townsend, who was otherwise a certainty for the World Cup squad which
is to be chosen on April 4, said that, initially, he thought his shin
bone had been broken. ''The knee is a bit crunchy but hopefully the
injury won't be as bad as we first thought,'' he said.
* GALA coach Peter Dods has called for players to be tied to their
clubs with legally binding contracts next season.
Dods, a British Lion and Scotland's 1984 Grand Slam full back, has
operated at Netherdale all season under the cloud of knowing that at
least three of his best players are likely to seek their rugby fortunes
in England next season.
Gregor Townsend has made no secret of the fact that he has signed
provisional forms for Northampton as has, ironically, Dods' younger
brother, Michael. In addition, Chris Dalgliesh has intimated that, all
else being equal, he will enlist with London Scottish at Richmond next
term.
The Gala trio are just three of about a dozen top Scottish players who
are considering offers to entice them south by the lure of attractive
jobs packages which English clubs have to offer. The latest name to
emerge from the rumour mill is that of Doddie Weir, the Melrose man
being linked with West Hartlepool, which is already home to Rob
Wainwright and Derrick Patterson.
Dods said after the Border derby clash with Hawick at the weekend --
at which, incidentally, John Connor, the businessman who wants to buy a
club, was a guest -- that he would be available to coach at Gala again
next season but only on his terms.
''I don't know how it could be done but I want to see a system in
place whereby players are committed to their clubs by means of a legally
binding contract. We just cannot have our best players being drained
away to England.
''At the end of the day this will have to happen. The Scottish Rugby
Union say they are looking at ways of finding employment for players
which would keep them in Scotland but, as yet, I haven't seen any hard
evidence that this will be successful. In any case, because of the
amount of time that an international player has to devote to the game, I
don't think that this will be easy to arrange,'' he declared.
The scenario which Dods envisages, however, is one which would be
fraught with difficulty. No doubt, in Glasgow this week -- with no city
sides in next season's Premier League Division One and the attendant
danger that top players will seek to play elsewhere -- the binding
contract has its attractions.
But, in Scotland at least, rugby players are amateurs and free agents
who will argue that they must be free to play where they wish. An
immediate case in point is that of Scotland fly-half Craig Chalmers, who
opted at the weekend -- despite the apparent dismay of Melrose -- to fly
with his family to Hong Kong for the sevens rather than play in the
crucial league game against Heriot's FP at the Greenyards.

THE connection between a famous Clydeside shipyard and the most
successful British film of all time may not be readily discernible. But
you begin to get the picture when you discover that the movie
heart-throb of the moment, 35-year-old Hugh Grant, star of Four Weddings
and a Funeral, is an immediate member of the Stephen family, whose
Glasgow shipyard at Linthouse was one of the great names to go down the
drain as part of the tragedy of that industry.
His father is James Murray Grant from Nairn, a former professional
soldier with the Seaforths and cousin of Sandy Stephen, the last
managing director of the family shipyard, who lives at Balfron.
The two cousins went to school together, at Cargilfield in Edinburgh,
and have kept in fairly close touch ever since. Little did they think
that young Hugh would emerge as the star of a film which is in line for
top honours at the Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles tonight.
He, in turn, would probably be surprised to find that there is a
second cinematic connection in the family. One of Stephen's famous
ships, HMS Amethyst, was the subject of another major movie, The Yangtse
Incident.
It is all part of the romance which comes to light in a fascinating
family tree compiled by Sandy Stephen to mark the 200th anniversary of
his great-great-grandfather and namesake, Alexander Stephen, who became
the real starting-point of the shipyard story.
The Stephens were actually a North-east farming family, one of whom
began a small shipbuilding business at Burghead, near Elgin, around
1750. The venture spread to Aberdeen, Arbroath, and Dundee but it was
the highly-talented Alexander who finally established it in Glasgow in
1850, when he took a 20-year lease of the Kelvinhaugh Shipyard, where
the Scottish Exhibition Centre now stands.
He was a productive man in more ways than one, fathering 18 children,
not one of whom succumbed to the many childhood diseases which afflicted
almost every family of the time. That didn't mean there was no tragedy.
In fact little Elizabeth died in a circular-saw accident when she was
four and Ruth had the misfortune to sleep with a nannie who rolled over
and smothered her at 12 weeks.
The fruitful growth of a family tree can be gauged from the fact that,
with their 18 children, Alexander and his wife were the genesis of a
spread which has so far totalled 707 descendants, of whom 502 are still
alive. They cover the full social spectrum, from a living peer, Lord
George Willoughby Moke Norrie of the Royal Hussars, to Murray Alexander
Stephen Paterson, a labourer in New Zealand.
Forging links with other prominent business names, one of them married
into the Templeton carpet family, while the present Sandy Stephen's
sister, Elizabeth, married Sir Ian Denholm from Lochwinnoch, member of
the prominent ship-owning family.
The Alexander who sparked off so much activity eventually retired to
Dundee and in 1870 two of his sons bought the then country estate at
Linthouse, on the south side of the river, where the Clyde Tunnel now
runs. It was here that the firm we came to know as Alexander Stephen and
Sons was to remain for over a century, launching more than 550 ships for
customers ranging from Clan Line, Ben Line, and Burrell to P &amp; O and the
New Zealand Shipping Company.
They laid out a modern shipyard, which took its place among the great
names of the Clyde, and built an engine works which supplied the
machinery for most of their own ships.
In the First World War they built 18 destroyers and torpedo boats and
produced 500 aeroplanes, a diversion from shipbuilding which involved
several Clydeside yards and comes as a surprise to many people.
Stephen's survived slumps and foreign competition in the 1930s and
went on to build the flagship of P &amp; O, the Viceroy of India. The Second
World War extended the range to aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,
and corvettes and included HMS Amethyst of The Yangtse Incident.
The company set an example in improving workers' conditions, including
a non-contributory pension scheme, but the post-war period brought that
undercutting of prices from Japan and other Far Eastern countries.
Combined with the power and intransigence of the trade unions, it
sounded the death knell of the British shipbuilding industry. The 1968
merger which became known as Upper Clyde Shipbuilders turned out to be a
disaster and the industry which made the river the best known of its
kind in the world came close to extinction.
The last of Stephen's property was sold in 1982 and the company went
into voluntary liquidation. Some of its ships took part in the Falklands
campaign and a few still sail the seas. The engine shop was dismantled
and rebuilt at Irvine to form the centre of the Scottish Maritime
Museum.
Though saddened by the demise of a proud family enterprise, Sandy
Stephen was in cheerful mood as he held a Sunday lunch last week to
introduce a host of Stephens to their spreading family tree. They
toasted the memory of their distinguished ancestor, Alexander, and
agreed to straighten his gravestone, which lies tilting in the ancient
cemetery of Fittie, by the fishing community of Aberdeen.

IF Turkey has a clear aim in its military invasion of Northern Iraq it
is keeping it remarkably secret from both its own people and the rest of
the world. The stated task of eliminating the bases there of the
separatist Kurdistan People's Party (PKK) is an old goal. Turkey tried
something similar, though on a markedly smaller scale, in 1992. On that
occasion the Turkish Government was helped by the mainstream Iraqi Kurds
who had been saved from Saddam Hussein's persecution. Matters are
different this time; the Iraqi Kurds, though no fonder of the extremists
of the PKK than they were three years ago, are riven by their own
disagreements and fearful of the inevitable civilian casualties from the
current fighting. The scale of the Turkish invasion makes this certain.
For reasons which nobody seems able to justify, the Turks have committed
35,000 ground troops and heavy air support to the invasion, most of it
now situated around the town of Zakho which is not a stronghold of the
PKK but which does contain many refugees.
If its aims are unclear, neither is there a firm indication from the
Turkish government of the planned duration of the invasion. Prime
Minister Tansu Ciller has suggested that the military action will last
only as long as is strictly necessary, but President Suleiman Demirel
says publicly that he believes it could continue for a year. The
confusion is compounded by the political tensions in Turkey and the
apparent belief in some quarters in Ankara that the Prime Minister has
ordered tough military action so that she can safely introduce liberal
laws later which will benefit the Kurds. If this is true it is a most
remarkable way to behave, especially as the PKK is probably not capable
of being eliminated by a Turkish army which looks set to discover the
wider horrors of guerrilla warfare, whether it establishes a security
corridor in Northern Iraq or not. One fact should be remembered amid the
confusion. Turkey is publicly adamant in its support for international
borders, but the Turkish establishment has long believed that much of
Northern Iraq is by rights Turkish and that it should not have been
taken from them in the post-First World War settlements.
If this last point has real relevance it will increase the nervousness
of the international community over Turkey's actions. There is,
properly, a good deal of anxiety over the position of refugees and of
Kurdish civilians. The United Nations, operating with speed and
commonsense for once, has evacuated some refugees from Zakho and plans
to take more to safety as soon as possible. As a distinguished
commentator has said, for the Kurds, history repeats itself, and always
as tragedy. International interest in the future of the Iraqi Kurds,
which has been flagging disgracefully of late, should be sharpened by
these events. There should be no question of using recent Kurdish
divisions as an excuse for abandoning them; it is, after all, expecting
too much for them to develop from tribal society to established and
democratic semi-autonomous status in a matter of scant years. Turkey
must also be encouraged to halt its military adventures as soon as
possible. The PKK cannot be beaten by an army, but in the attempt the
delicate balance of relations in this vital area may be radically
disturbed.

THERE is a form of erotomania in which the patient, in love with some
famous person, imagines that the object of his devotion returns his
feelings whereas she is either unaware of them or simply dismisses them
as fan worship.
I always think of this sad condition when I read articles by
right-wing commentators such as Michael Fry about the special
relationship which they persist in imagining exists between the USA and
the UK (March 22).
In the medical condition the patient sometimes appears to come to his
senses, realising that the beloved is, in fact, indifferent to him. But
such is the power of the infatuation that he soon begins to find excuses
for the apparent coldness (''It's nasty Bill Clinton who is coming
between us'').
The patient's hold on reality now becomes very tenuous indeed as
rebuffs and even deliberate insults are interpreted as coded messages of
love.
It is sad that Michael Fry and many of his right-wing friends should
suffer from a political form of this distressing condition. It is
worrying that it appears that every Prime Minister since Churchill, with
the exception of Sir Edward Heath, has been similarly afflicted.
Surely reality is summed up by the eighties joke: When Reagan says
''Jump!'' Thatcher asks ''How high?''

THE Health Minister, Gerald Malone, seemed amazingly callous when he
pronounced that NHS nurses and therapists, etc, might just have to
swallow a bitter pill this year and accept their disastrous pay offer of
1% plus locally negotiated top-ups of up to 2% (March 23).
Is he not aware that most NHS trusts, at least in Scotland, are not
even set up yet to negotiate with workers about pay and conditions?
Does he not understand that even if negotiations were possible most
trusts would be unable to fund 3% of pay rises without further
efficiency savings?
Has he estimated the cost of training thousands of health workers and
personnel managers to conduct fair negotiations?
Why replace an efficient, relatively cheap machinery like Whitley
Council, where pay and conditions for health workers are negotiated
satisfactorily on a national basis, with hundreds of expensive,
time-consuming bodies up and down the land?
Does he not understand that nurses and therapists abhor the idea of
pitching one trust against another, forcing ultimately unequal health
care provision on the nation, dictated by greed and those who can shout
the loudest?
We have never known such anger among local NHS staff. They are
seething at the derisory national offer and the threats that local
bargaining will bring. If the Government had set out deliberately to
stir up trouble in hospitals, it couldn't have been more successful.
After years of change, stress, and cuts in our hospitals, the last thing
that staff want is more disruption.

THE Ayrshire child currently refusing to return home was one of three
children denied parental access on a psychiatrist's recommendation.
Witheld from the psychiatrist were care work notes, the fact that social
workers were using anatomical dolls, that they were doing ''therapy''
and role-play, and that children were being taken on outings to churches
and graveyards to spark off ''disclosures''
Continued denial of access to the Orkney ''W'' children relies on
similar crucial documentation withheld from a psychiatrist and an
adoption agency. The damage social workers, the RSSPCC, and mistaken
medical evidence have wrought in Ayrshire is mirrored by identical
treatment meted out to the ''W'' children, as are the Criminal Injuries
Compensation claims made to justify social work mistakes.
Four of the ''W'' children now have no contact with home, and one
child recommended access by a psychiatrist has still not set foot in
Orkney despite her pleas to do so. Alas, their ordeal is far from over.

NEW Zealander Greg Turner let out a closely-guarded secret after
having won the Turespana Balearic Open by two strokes yesterday in
Majorca.
After he had held off Costantino Rocca with a closing 68, Turner
revealed that every time he has taken a lead into the final round of a
tournament he has gone on to triumph.
''I've done before it in New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia, but
when I was asked on Saturday what my record of front-running was, I
didn't answer -- I didn't want to tempt fate,'' said the 32-year-old
after he had collected the #40,000 first prize and #3000 more for his
course-record 65 in the second round.
Turner's third European Tour success, achieved with a 14-under-par
total of 274, was certainly the most unlikely of the three. He had spent
the previous four weeks fishing and reading.
Rocca's 67 equalled the best round of the day, but since he had
started the final round three adrift, it was still not enough. He
nevertheless moves up to fifth in the current Ryder Cup points table.
It was head-to-head between the pair, and two ahead with five to play
was never going to be safe, but Turner kept cool, getting up and down
from off the green at the fourteenth and sixteenth and then matching
Rocca's pars at the final two holes.
Mark Mouland, joint-fourth with one hole to play, dumped two balls
into the water for a quadruple-bogey 7. It dropped him to eleventh
place.

274 -- G Turner (New Zealand) 74, 65, 67, 68 (#40,478).

won the Ken Murray Memorial Trophy with a one-over-par 68 at Greenock on
Saturday.
In wet and windy conditions he varied from par on only three holes,

hole, a par-3 from the club's nine-hole course which replaced the
out-of-commission second on the main course.

with 584 Stableford points against a President's Select (578) and a
Greenock team (574). Leading scores:
68 -- D B Howard (Cochrane Castle). 72 -- M Carmichael (Greenock), A

SCOTLAND captain Gavin Hastings and stand-off Craig Chalmers looked on
in admiration yesterday as the All Blacks retained their title in the
Honk Kong Sevens.
They witnessed a lot of New Zealand power on show, both collectively
and individually, as Fiji were overwhelmed 35-17 in the final.
And they realised that if the All Blacks needed a player to replace
the massively built Vainga Tuigamala, then they have certainly found one
in Jonah Lomu, a 6ft 3in, 17st sprinter whose charging runs caused chaos
in the Fiji defence.
Lomu, in fact, scored two of New Zealand's tries in the final, the
other touchdowns coming from the 30-year-old veteran, Eric Rush, wing
Peter Woods -- who has appeared at Melrose -- and centre Adrian
Cashmore, who succeeded with all five conversions.
New Zealand never looked troubled as they cruised to the final,
beating South Africa 26-0 in the quarters and Western Samoa by an
identical score in the semis.
Fiji perhaps played their best rugby in the semi-finals where they
achieved a 35-5 victory over Australia. The Wallabies, however, at least
had the satisfaction of avenging their defeat by England in the 1993
World Cup final at Murrayfield two years ago by dismissing the English
side 28-0 at the quarter-final stage.
Australia had been quick to spot England's deficiencies. Their coach,
Glem Ella, said: ''We knew England did not have any great pace and so
that made our planning a lot easier.''
England, indeed, were exposed by their shortage of pace up front and,
to a certain extent, behind the scrum, where they lacked a finisher.
Ironic perhaps that Tony Underwood and Jeremy Guscott were spectators at
England's demise.
Ella, however, praised England's defence, saying: ''I was impressed by
their work-rate in the tackle.''
None more so than scrum half Dave Scully, who played in the World Cup
final in 1993. Afterwards, Scully admitted: ''It was unrealistic to
expect us to do much in Hong Kong, given that we have not played in any
tournament before this.
''But the exercise of coming here is worthwhile. You have to get used
to playing in front of a crowd like this,'' said the Wakefield player.
England at least reached the final of the Cup, whereas both Ireland
and France were relegated to the plate.
But even this level proved too much for both, Ireland going out 22-14
to Japan in the quarter-finals, while France were dismissed by Korea
17-12.
What would have interested Hastings and Chalmers was the form of Tonga
and the Ivory Coast. The verdict on the latter must be that they pose no
serious threat in the World Cup finals later this year, while Tonga
remain an unknown and unpredictable entity.
Yesterday, coach Fakahau Valu admitted that Tonga would field a
new-look side in South Africa. He added: ''It is unlikely that any of
those who played against Scotland in Tonga two years ago will be in the
World Cup.''
Tonga reached the quarter-finals of the cup only to lose 28-5 to
Western Samoa in a South Sea islands' derby match.
Elsewhere, Canada regained some respectability in sevens rugby by
winning the Plate competition with a 35-12 victory over Argentina in the
final. In the Bowl, hosts Hong Kong retained their title with an
emphatic 45-7 victory over Papua New Guinea.
RESULTS: Quarter-finals: New Zealand 26, South Africa 0; Western Samoa
28, Tonga 5; Fiji 47, Namibia 0; Australia 28, England 0.
Semi-finals: New Zealand 26, Western Samoa 0, Fiji 35, Australia 5.
Final: New Zealand 35, Fiji 17.

Tenerife's rich heritage comes as a surprise to Phil Trotter who joins
the latest British invasion of the friendly island
THE British have been after a piece of the action in Tenerife since
the days when Britannia ruled the waves, though initial efforts at
gaining a foothold resulted in a relatively rare reversal.
No less a seadog than Horatio Nelson was forced to drop the
''able-bodied seaman'' moniker following a skirmish off the island's
capital Santa Cruz, when a cannonball blew his arm off and helped send
our normally jolly tars homeward -- their only booty the bitter taste of
defeat.
Tiger, the cannon which caused all the trouble for Nelson, not to
mention his tailor, is displayed in the old fort of Paso Alto (now
converted into a museum) in the town, as are the bedraggled British
colours from that day.
A turn round the fort and a glance at the coastline around the town
will quickly convince doubters of two indisputable facts.
The first is that this is an island steeped in bloody history with
claim and counter claim by the Portuguese, British, and finally Spanish.
The second is that Nelson knew a great holiday destination when he saw
one.
Lying some 60 miles off southern Morocco, and blessed with best of
mild trade winds and the Gulf Stream, the island's climate is warm,
pleasant, and almost always sunny.
The landscape is dominated by Mount Teide, at 3718 metres the highest
peak in all of Spain's mainland and dominions. Holidaymakers and locals
eat, drink and blissfully sleep on what is essentially an enormous
volcano.
Steep slopes of granite and basalt lava tumble right down to the
white-capped breakers. Roads snake round vertical gullies and the vast
majority of the agriculture is based on the age-old system of terraced
plots hacked out of the steep and what looks like inhospitable rock. Yet
the banana crop, next to tourism the island's biggest industry, is proof
of Tenerife's fertility.
Thanks to the diversity of altitudes tourists can, if they've the
energy, move from a baking-hot black beach to a snow field on the high
slopes of Teide in a couple of hours.
The funicular railway to the peak provides breath-taking views of mile
after mile of lava fields -- a testament to what the planet can get up
to when motion sickness gets the better of it.
Should you wish to get out and about, the best way to travel is by
hired car using the island's motorway (TF1) which runs from Los
Cristianos to Santa Cruz in the north. Thereafter the hair-pin bend
comes into its own and, particularly at night on the hill roads, is not
for the faint-hearted.
But the vast majority of people come to Tenerife to relax; to find
somewhere where the entire day can be spent contemplating exactly the
right moment to motivate muscles toward the tapas bar before attempting
to re-dock with the pool-side lounger. Somewhere where everything is
right to hand and done for you at the drop of hat.
The Tinerfenos (people of Tenerife) have cracked this stress bursting
holiday notion . . .they call it the good quality, clean and friendly
hotel.
Tourist guides will explain the finer points of Tenerife's
architectural heritage and it's true there are fine examples of the
Baroque style -- La Concepcion church in La Orotava is a prime example.
The finely-worked wooden balconies adorning may of the houses in the
old town are also of interest but since the 60s, when tourism really
picked up in Tenerife, the most significant architectural feats on the
island have been the hotels.
Huge beach hotels straddle the sandy bays in Playa De Las Americas,
often with a clutch of restaurants and bars slung in under them. Here
you can dance, disco, or club the night away before retiring to the
beach for a spot of wave counting between naps the following morning.
Further along the southern coast, Los Gigantes features hotels built
into the side of the cliffs or out on promontories surrounded by the
waves.
On the other side of the island, hotels on the front at Puerto de la
Cruz have their own swimming lagoons set in manicured gardens.
Away from the towns, they crop up in all manner of places, from lodges
set in the high ground to isolated bays with one small family-run affair
at its head.
Naturally, some will be better than others but at Club Paraiso in
Playa Paraiso, facilities include two pools, two tennis courts, a
gymnasium, a five-a-side football/hockey court, petanque and nightly
free entertainment in the lounge bar.
Our self-catering room was actually a sizeable four-room affair
complete with living room, television and breakfast bar. Next door was a
large bedroom off which was the bathroom/shower, and WC. All were
spotless.
Our only difficulty with the place was understanding where the profit
lay in our week's holiday, which came in a shade under #200 with
Airtours.
But money doesn't seem to be in short supply on the island and,
perhaps consequently, the Tinerfenos are a happy, obliging people.
Collectively, the Canaries are known as ''the friendly islands'' and
you'll find few who disagree with the title, unless you happen to bump
into the ghost of Lord Nelson.

THERE is no stopping City of Glasgow Ragazzi. At Meadowbank yesterday,
they broke all Scottish records by becoming the first team to win three
successive league and cup doubles.
After having won the league earlier this month, Ragazzi added the
Royal Bank Scottish Cup by beating Kilmarnock 15-8, 15-7, 15-6 in the
final.
It was not that Kilmarnock did much wrong. They asked Ragazzi plenty
of questions in the opening set and hardly put a foot wrong, with Paul
Carruthers and captain Michael Rhodes in outstanding form. However,
Ragazzi play the game at a higher intensity than other Scottish teams
and with Iain Grubb, Gary McGuire, and Ian Mackenzie all capable of
finding the floor consistently with the ball, it was only a matter of
time before Kilmarnock buckled.
''We had a game plan, but we just could not sustain it,'' admitted
player-coach Jim McKenna. ''And we lost our way a bit in the second set,
when we let some refereeing decisions get to us.''
McKenna and team-mate Allan Thomas both received yellow cards as
Kilmarnock slipped from 3-3 to 9-3, and from that point Ragazzi were not
going to lose control.
Rucanor Jets won the women's cup for the first time in four years when
they beat league champions MCA Powerhouse Cardinals in a slightly
disappointing final. The Edinburgh side, inspired by some power-hitting
from Lynne Brammall, won in straights sets, 17-15, 15-7, 15-13.

A STRONG contribution from its stake in satellite broadcaster BSkyB,
coupled with growth in advertising, should enable media group Pearson to
report profits of around #260m today. This compares favourably with last
year's #208.6m. A small increase in the dividend to 14.5 is anticipated.
City analysts will be closely analysing the effect of rising newsprint
prices on its newspaper interests, which include the Financial Times.
Its leisure division should benefit from steady growth at its Madame
Tussauds tourist attraction in London.
Gloomy news is expected from Inchcape's finals, which will be held
back because motor sales and margins have been adversely affected by the
strong yen and a slowdown in economic growth in the Far East. Brokers
are forecasting a 16% fall in taxable profits to #227m.
P &amp; O sails in on Tuesday with profits expected to rise around 6% to
#235m on the back of a recovery in shipping volumes and tourism.
Next is expected to provide some welcome cheer in the retail sector on
Wednesday. It continues to consolidate its remarkable transformation
from near collapse. Its profits could jump by 40% to between #99m and
#105m compared with #73.5m in 1994.
The company has already reported strong sales figures from August to
December, when retail sales leapt 17% and mail order by 35%. Speculation
surrounds the possible uses for Next's growing cash resources, estimated
at between #155m and #180m. There is thought to be the possiblilty of a
share buy-back.
Wednesday also sees publication of a trading statement from Blue
Circle. Strong demand for cement in the UK and soaring US prices should
allow the company to announce strong profits growth. Analysts expect a
pre-tax profit of #230m to #245m once the group has set aside a
provision of more than #10m to account for a European Commission fine
which it is disputing.
The City is keenly waiting news of disposals from textile group Coats
Viyella. The fact that the results announcement has been slightly
delayed suggests to most analysts that news may be forthcoming on the
sale of the yarns division. This was put on the market last year.
Analysts are predicting that pre-disposal pre-tax profits will be in a
range of #146.5m to #170m compared with #150m last time. The mild autumn
is expected to hold back clothing sales in Europe but profits are
expected to improve from its fashion businesses of Jaeger and Viyella.
On Thursday building materials group Redland is predicted to make
pre-tax profits of around #360m against #279m previously. A bigger tax
burden is anticipated, of around 34%, due to the reunification or
solidarity tax in Germany where its Braas subsidiary is the single
biggest contributor to group profits. The dividend is expected to be
maintained at 25p despite a widespread feeling that it has been paying
too much for too long.
Yet another mild winter is expected to restrain profit growth at Calor
Group. Analysts forecast a net profit range of #32m to #37.2m against
#32.8m in 1993.
Analysts want to see signs of reduced dependency on the domestic
market from its efforts to diversify into Eastern Europe. Attention will
also focus on the level of margins achieved and signs of lower operating
costs.

I WAS fortunate enough to be employed at the Glasgow Garden Festival.
From conversations held with many of the 428,000 people who visited our
garden in the water and maritime section, the same theme was repeated
over and over, ''This is marvellous. They're not going to pull all this
down afterwards, are they?''
C M Ramsay's memories of a glorious summer must indeed be rose-tinted.
My personal diary kept throughout the entire five-month period recorded
rain, hail, cloud, gales, and sunshine. The weather seemed to make
little difference to our daily visitor numbers.
If role models are required, I cite cities like Amsterdam, Bruges, and
Paris, all of which have made positive and imaginative use of their
canals and waterways as tourist attractions.
Let's keep this part of the river for just that -- make it vibrant
once more and put the proposed business park on some other more
appropriate site.

IF, as expected, the Tories take another electoral drubbing in the
Scottish and then the English local elections, internal party pressure
on the Prime Minister will increase. It is already considerable; and
yesterday Mr Rifkind, the Secretary for State for Defence, admitted that
there might be a challenge to Mr Major this autumn, the last time when a
change of leadership could be most easily accommodated to give a
successor enough time to play himself in before the next General
Election. The alternative to a formal challenge is that Mr Major decides
to resign, an outcome which seems highly unlikely, given the combination
of resilience and stubbornness which is one of his strengths. By the
test of the circumstances which surrounded Mrs Thatcher's ejection,
there may seem every reason to justify a challenge to her successor. The
Tories are doing very badly in every poll available, from opinion polls
to by-elections, local elections, and the European elections. The
changed rules since Mrs Thatcher's going make it harder for a stalking
horse to appear, but Mr Rifkind's admission suggests that the required
30-odd Tory MPs needed to back one are already there. As against all
that, there is the fact that the latest opinion-poll findings suggest
that a new leader would hardly perform much better: it seems to be the
Government, and not merely its head, which is so desperately unpopular.
The two most likely replacements, Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke, would
inevitably be divisive figures from the same wing of the party; they
have Europhile views. Mr Portillo, their eventual challenger, may not
yet be ready to run against them, but he would not be a healer either,
being far too sceptical of Europe to unite the party. If the famous Tory
instinct for survival persists still, there might after all be broad
support for Mr Heseltine as a potential electoral winner, but the
fissure in the party over Europe really seems to be too deep for anyone
to bridge. As it happens, Mr Major himself is probably sounding the
notes most likely to hold Tories together. That he has none the less
failed to do so is an ominous sign.
There remain two years to go before there has to be a General
Election. Mr Major would not be human if he did not calculate that
several factors would strongly affect popular opinion if their
significance and success were accepted and attributed to him. The first
is peace in Ulster. There is little doubting his personal contribution
to such an outcome and, if it can demonstrated to be continuing, he
ought to benefit. The second is continuing low inflation. Many will
still be unhappy with some of its consequences, but most people will
appreciate its value, and accept the pain that passing from inflation to
stable prices and money inevitably imposes. Thirdly, the economic
improvement which is evident in the employment figures and the export
industries, but especially in services, may have time to filter down to
popular awareness. The fact that none of that positive trio has yet
begun to deliver a bonus in the public's perception of the Government is
what is most worrying to Tory political observers who are not directly
involved in its fortunes themselves. It could simply be the case that
the country is fed up with such a long-lasting administration (although
its composition and thrust of policy has changed markedly over its
life). In that case, changing the leader may change little else.

THERE is likely to be active trading in the shares of brewer Scottish
&amp; Newcastle today, ahead of a possible announcement this week of the
#600m acquisition of Courage, Britain's second largest brewer. Courage
is currently owned by the Australian group Foster's Brewing, which may
decide to float Courage on the stock market instead.
Talks have been taking place for several months and were given a boost
earlier this month with the withdrawal of Whitbread as a potential rival
suitor.
However, any proposed merger is likely to attract the attentions of
the Office of Fair Trading because if the deal comes off it will
catapult Scottish &amp; Newcastle to the top of the brewing tree ahead of
Bass.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle currently has around 12% market share while
Courage has 19% of the UK beer market. The Scottish-based brewerhas
already done business with Courage, which up until the end of the month,
supplies beer to S&amp;N's Chef &amp; Brewer pub estate which it acquired from
Grand Metropolitan in November 1993.
There is geographic logic in merging the two companies although given
the overcapacity in the market, rationalisation is bound to result in
the possible closure of breweries. Courage's operations in southern
England complement S&amp;N's brand strengths in Scotland and northern
England.
Courage's brands include Holsten, Kronenbourg, John Smith's, and
Foster's, its famous ''amber nectar''.
There is a certain irony if the acquisition takes place given that
seven years ago Scottish and Newcastle itself was the subject of a
hostile #1600m bid from Elders IXL of Australia, then owner's of
Foster's.
However, there are analysts who believe that rather than buying
Courage, it may be better for S&amp;N to concentrate on improving margins
within Chef &amp; Brewer and its original pub estate.
In the six months to 30 October 1994, S&amp;N reported a 28% increase in
pre-tax profits to #145.1m. Within that amount, profits from brewing and
related activities fell to #45.4m from #50.4m on almost static sales of
#445m.
Amid difficult trading conditions, S&amp;N believes that the profitable
way forward for the group is to invest in premium brands which can
command higher margins. S&amp;N's premium brands such as Beck's lager and
Theakston's ales continue to grow as a proportion of total sales and
account for almost half the total.
This has provided it with some protection from the intense competition
that has hit sales of its mid-range products. Along with all brewers,
Scottish and Newcastle has been hit by cheap imported beer brought in
from France although it has been less badly affected than others in
terms of lost market share and profits.
Given changing social and demographic factors with an ageing
population and more women using pubs, those pub operators who treat
their bars as retail outlets rather than just a means of selling beer
will be most successful.
S&amp;N, with its wide spread of businesses covering the brewing, retail,
and leisure sectors, appears one of the better placed to prosper in the
future.

THE headline leaping out from the Sunday morning news stands issued a
chilling warning: ''I'll kill the first man I fight.''
First assumptions were that Eric the Red was at it again, but the
story was about another slugger, Mike Tyson, who was released from jail
at the weekend.
Nevertheless, that thoughts should immediately relate such a nasty
headline to Eric Cantona is a measure of his notoriety, yet this is the
footballer so many are anxious to defend. It was to howls of protest and
cries of ''foul'' that he was sentenced to two weeks in the pokey for
his assault on a fan -- and, yes, I use the term loosely -- at Selhurst
Park recently.
Supporters and friends of Manchester United, good people like Pat
Crerand, lined up to question the process of justice in this country.
They wanted to know if Cantona had been singled out for special
treatment because of his celebrity status.
One fan even suggested the magistrate at Croydon had used the case,
which attracted great attention, to make a name for herself. Fans are
like that, bless them -- blind.
The consensus seems to be that Cantona, who was released on bail
pending an appeal aganst his sentence, has not been treated like an
ordinary citizen up on a common assault charge. However, the Frenchman's
supporters are choosing to ignore what has gone before, and I am not
referring to his previous misdemeanours.
On the night Cantona attacked the fan, who, it was allegedm severely
provoked the player, he was not treated like one of us. Had he been,
then the constabulary would have pounced on Cantona twisting his arms up
his back as they dragged him along the track at Selhurst Park.
In his defence, his legal team made mention of the verbal abuse which
he had to endure and, frankly, no-one ought to be subjected to that. The
abuse of players because of their race, colour, or religion disgraces
the business, but clubs and authorities have done little either to
address or arrest the problem.
If they had acted sooner, and if supporters in general were able to
comprehend that a ticket to a match is not a licence to abuse or use the
most foul language, perhaps Cantona would not have crossed the boundary
between decency and violence.
Police and stewards should not be turning blind eyes or giving abuse a
rubber ear. It would not be tolerated in the streets or in the theatre,
and football grounds should be no different.
How to do it, though, that is the question. It would be unreasonable
to expect the police to frogmarch away every offender -- there wouldn't
be enough black marias to transport the captured to the station -- but
there must be a way to address the problem.
It has been suggested that matches be stopped when the abuse,
regardless of its nature, is clearly audible. It's a radical notion and
one which would probably appal traditionalists, but the more thought
applied to the suggestion the greater its appeal becomes.
Please, think about it. If matches were held up and attention focused
on the guilty in the stands, who would then be more easily identified
and singled out, it might help those who are in the habit of abusing
players think twice. Something has to be done because verbal attacks can
be as appalling and dangerous as those of a physical nature.
The players should be willing to take a stand on the issue and put a
foot on the ball when one of their number is being abused. They should
say they are not prepared to perform before people who hurl racist or
sectarian taunts.
It is a much better and more civilised way of retaliating than leaping
into the crowd a la Cantona. That type of reaction can never be
condoned.
When he resorted to violence he abdicated his responsibilities. If a
sporting superstar accepts the money and the fame, he or she must also
accept the obligation to set decent examples.
It is unfortunate for them but they cannot choose when and where to
behave with decency. That responsibility rests with them at all times.
In fact, it comes with the territory.
Meanwhile, Massimo Moratti, the new president of Italy's
Internazionale, of Milan, has been reported as confirming that Cantona
is his prime target for next season. ''I have sent a fax to Manchester
United to sound out whether they are prepared to sell the player. I
haven't made an offer, that will be the next step,'' Moratti was quoted
as saying in Italian newspapers.
Manchester United are understood to be calling an emergency board
meeting today to discuss the situation.

Patricia Fenn finds that enjoying a stay in Salcombe is plain sailing
THE French like Salcombe -- and no wonder. They sail across from
Brittany, through the spectacular entry to the estuary, drop anchor in
one of Britain's most beautiful harbours and go ashore to find a range
of restaurants from Chinese take-away to gourmet fish cuisine, pubs, and
shops that stay open until 10pm without the dread Gallic lunch break.
Constant animation is part of the charm. At any time of the day Fore
Street will be clogged with good-tempered mixture of pram-pushers, dogs,
OAPs and teenagers arm-in-arm. Cars just have to be patient and choose
their moment to inch along but you rarely hear an impatient honk. Nobody
hurries in Salcombe.
The car 'problem' and indeed the transport problem generally has been
the town's salvation. The fact that the nearest railway station is an
expensive 40 minutes' taxi ride away in Totnes and that the car park
involves a long pram-push to the beaches, keeps the crowds down to
manageable proportions.
So does another 'disadvantage' -- the best sands are across the water
in East Portlemouth -- 65p each way by ferry. No doubt about it, the
clever mode of travel is by boat. Hire one, and that glorious stretch of
coastline is all yours. So is the estuary. Study the tide table and head
up to South Pool. You will be part of a mini armada of small craft
heading lunch at a pub the ducks on the stream provide the cabaret.
Dally too long and you'll have the indignity of having to wade over the
mud and push the boat out.
The estuary is a sailor's non-pareil. Adventurous sailing out to sea
and a perfect training ground in the harbour. Many a sailing veteran has
sorted out his sheets from his shrouds in a course run by the Island
Cruising Club. The harbour is invariably dotted with coloured sails,
capsized dinghies and precarious windsurfers through which the more
experienced sailors must thread their way.
You don't have to sail. Landlubbers will find a lot of glorious land.
The National Trust owns the coastline on both sides of the estuary and
the walks are superb. From South Sands on the town side, climb the path
towards Bolt Head and look dizzily down to Starehole Bay, where the
bones of an old sailing ship, the Herzogin Cecilie, still attract many
divers. Then you can walk to the cliff edge or turn inland and take the
even higher path home, calling in at the semi-tropical gardens of
Overbecks Museum.
On the Portlemouth side, take the ferry to Fisherman's Cove, remove
your shoes and walk along the sand, past Smalls and Cable Cove and Mill
Bay to Sunny Cove. Take a deep breath and zig-zag round the cliff edge,
with spectacular views out to sea, dotted with sails and fishing boats,
to Gara Rock, where a hotel contrived from old Coastguard cottages
serves cream teas.
With walks, fishing trips and beachcombing, there is plenty to fill an
unsophisticated week without taking the car, but the surrounding South
Hams countryside offers numerous alternatives. The beach at Bantham is
one of Devon's most interesting boasting dunes, rocks, surfing and
fishing in the river Avon. Walk round the headland from Bantham to
Thurlestone for a pasty then back again for scrumpy. The rewarding towns
of Totnes and Darmouth are nearby, the moors are waiting to be tramped
over, with Devon pubs galore and Plymouth save up for wet days.
Information: Most visitors rent holiday cottages or use one of the
dozens of Band Bs, a list of which can be obtained from the Town
Information Centre in Market Street. 0548 843927. Renting from Salcombe
Holiday Homes: 0158 843485. Sailing instruction from Island Cruising

NEW construction regulations are set to transform the industry. The
Construction (Design and Management) Regulations -- known in the trade
as ''CDM' -- come into effect in April.
They will mean that all buildings must be designed so that they can be
constructed, operated and demolished safely. The regulations pose
serious implications for many branches of the construction and property
industry.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland (RICS) has
launched a joint initiative with the Centre for Maritime and Industrial
Safety Technology (C-MIST). The joint RICS/C-MIST agreement will provide
training courses for chartered surveyors and other construction
professionals.
Eileen Masterman, director of the RICS in Scotland, said: ''There are
about 100 deaths each year in the UK construction industry. This must be
reduced and I am certain that the CDM regulations will help.'' The
intensive courses aim to develop knowledge and confidence about the role
of planning supervisor in construction projects.

GLASGOW Brightsiders' nerve once again appeared to fail them yesterday
when they led Livingston Bulls 63-59 with just over two minutes left of
their first-division decider at Easterhouse Sports Centre.
Bulls fought back to level the scores 65-65 at full-time and
controlled the five extra minutes for a 76-67 victory which gave them
their seventh Scottish league title in a row and fourteenth in 17 years.
Scottish junior cap Robert McKechnie had come on court for the first
time with seven minutes left to lift the home side from a four-point
deficit. But a couple of over-ambitious passes, plus the extreme
competitiveness of Bulls' Great Britain cap Iain Maclean, who
successfully drew two fouls then put away four out of five free throws,
pulled the champions back from the brink.
''We stopped competing,'' complained Brightsiders' coach, James
McKechnie, whose team gave away a 13-point advantage in the first league
meeting between the teams last November.
In extra time, Craig Robertson scored a three-pointer and Dougie
Reilly a 2 to prove they are not a one-man team. In fact, eight of the
Bulls scored, with Gordon Smith adding 18, Robertson eight, and Alan
Lamb seven. Alan Kiddie scored 20 and Craig Brownlie 15 for Glasgow.

PETER Ebdon completed a sensational recovery to win the Benson and
Hedges Irish Masters at Goffs, County Kildare, last night.
He came back from 0-4, 1-5, and 6-8 to beat world champion Stephen
Hendry 9-8, who conceded with two reds left in the deciding frame.
''I've come back in matches before but I don't know whether I can keep
doing it. The crowd pulled me through in this final,'' said Ebdon.
For Hendry, history had repeated itself. Six years ago he led Alex
Higgins 8-6 only to lose 9-8 in the final.
Ebdon produced breaks of 123, 75, 59, 50, and, in the last frame, 45.
Hendry had runs of 101, 82, 70, and 59 but was never able to dampen
Ebdon's enthusiasm on the big occasion.
The Scot, chasing his fifth title of the season, led 4-0 but Ebdon's
century came immediately after the first interval.
It was followed in frame six by a reply in kind by Hendry, who could
have won the seventh despite trailing 60-21 but he hit the black first
instead of the final red when negotiating a half-snooker.
Ebdon, 5-2 down when they resumed, won three of the next four frames
with breaks of 75, 50, 44, and 42 against Hendry's 70 in the ninth
frame. After the interval, Ebdon levelled at 6-6 but the Scot seem
assured of victory when he moved to 8-6 up.
Each had recorded a 6-3 semi-final win on Saturday, with Ebdon
defeating John Parrott while Hendry put out wild-card entry Joe Swail.
SPENCERS LADIES CHAMPIONSHIP
Semi-finals -- Julie Gillespie (Doune) beat Catherine Stott (Aberdeen)

Stewart McIntosh examines the current state of the construction
industry
AS they celebrate the centenary of their federation, Scotland's
builders are still suffering from a recession-induced hangover. And the
cure is beyond their control.
Members of the Scottish Building Employers Federation are hoping that
economic conditions will improve sufficiently for the industry to get
fully back on its feet this year.
To have survived this length of time in the longest downturn in living
memory, the SBEF's members must be built of hardy stuff -- and they are
determined to dig their way through to the upturn. There are certain to
be some changes as the industry adjusts to new market conditions.
SBEF Secretary Bob Campbell predicts that some of Scotland's
medium-sized contracting firms will seek amalgamations in the near
future to secure their future. ''It is the obvious move to make and will
bring greater efficiency and lower costs at a time when tender prices
are still being pared to the bone,'' he says.
Even the housebuilding sector which seemed, for a while, to have
recovered from the property slump, is still not fully back into its
stride. ''Fiscal changes introduced by the government are making it more
and more difficult for people to take that first step onto the housing
ladder,'' says Bob Campbell.
Reductions in mortgage interest relief and the removal of mortgage
assistance for those who lose their job are combining to make people
more reluctant to purchase new homes, he believes.
He is also very concerned about the dwindling supply of building land
and predicts that the current changes in local government organisation
will make matters worse. ''Land supply has been drying up for some time
and most builders are having difficulty in getting land released or,
when it is released, are having problems in getting it zoned for
residential use. The changes to new local government organisations mean
planners will be likely to postpone decisions until the new unitary
authorities are well-established,'' he says.
The great irony in all of this, he believes, is the fact that house
prices are still low and interest rates attractive. ''There really has
never been a better time to buy,'' he says.
Having built strong foundations over the last century, the SBEF
expects to continue doing so for the next 100 years. Many of the
associations which came together to form the federation have histories
stretching much further back than a century -- some of them have their
origins in the ancient trade guilds. Glasgow's masons and wrights can
trace their origins all the way back to 1057 when King Malcolm III
granted them a Royal Charter.
The development of the federation was significantly affected by the
first world war and it had to be reconstituted in 1918, when the
headquarters was moved from Edinburgh to Glasgow. By the 1960s the need
for a fully professional organisation was recognised and the first
full-time Secretary and Treasurer were appointed in 1964. During the
last 25 years additional services have been added to cover specialist
fields such as housebuilding.
The lobbying function of the federation has also been expanded to
ensure that the interests of the industry are made known to policy
makers. Bob Campbell says: ''As it stands on the threshold of the next
100 years, SBEF is facing up to the challenges of an ever-changing world
and yet its primary function remains the same. The aim of SBEF is to
assist the members in the conduct of their business and, although proud
of its history, it is a vibrant organisation dedicated to looking
forward to the challenges of the future.''
Meanwhile, the federation has chosen an eminently practical way of
celebrating its centenary. Various fund-raising efforts for charities
were considered, but in the end it was decided to campaign throughout
the industry for the maximum number of blood donations.
''Despite advances in the health and safety of building sites, by its
very nature the industry is more dangerous than many others. A blood
donation campaign seemed to be a fitting way to celebrate our
centenary,'' says Bob Campbell.
'As it
stands on
the
threshold
of the next
100 years,
SBEF is
facing up to
the
challenges
of an ever-
changing
world.
It is
dedicated
to looking
forward to
the future'

JUST four seconds, at the end of the 13 miles of the Alloa
half-marathon, separated Steven Wylie from the course record and a #100
bonus yesterday, writes Doug Gillon.
Wylie, a member of Cambuslang's winning national cross-country team,
clocked 66min 27sec, tantalisingly close to the mark held by four-times
winner Alan Robson. But this was an impressive run by the 23-year-old
Wylie, because four miles, beneath the Hillfoots, were run into the
teeth of a strong wind.
Having broken clear, he had to face it and the formidable Menstrie
Brae alone, whereas the pursuit -- clubmate Graeme Croll, John Robson,
and veteran Brian Kirkwood -- bunched together for what mutual relief
could be gained.
Wylie had the consolation of a #150 cash prize after having won by 70
seconds. Croll, racing the London Marathon next Sunday, nursed his
reserves, waiting till the final mile before breaking clear.
Elizabeth Riley, a Seattle medical student at Aberdeen and the
Scottish cross-country runner-up, is the first overseas winner in the
event's 13-year history. She won without threatening the record of
runner-up Sandra Branney.
Livingston's John Sherban ran with the American for much of the route.
''He nursed her along, and that made me angry,'' said Branney. ''Liz was
a deserved winner, but it would have been a better race without him
interfering.''
Karen Darke, who set out a few minutes behind the field, won the
wheelchair division.

IN one of the largest recent Scottish Office completions, Bovis
Construction provided the Inland Revenue with a new East Kilbride
headquarters. The 25,000 sq m complex was built to replace Centre One
and is located in the Philipshill district of the new town.
The #24m ''design-manage-construct'' contract was completed on time
and within budget. It provides accommodation for some 1600 staff and
comes with restaurant, fitness, and childcare facilities. Parking for up
to 840 vehicles has been included on the 17-acre greenfield site.
In response to the client's brief, the new Centre 1 embraces an energy
conservation policy. The linear plan of the building is designed to
exploit natural ventilation. Temperature control, zoning of heating
controls, the use of solar gain, and a cost-saving lighting system
combine to minimise greenhouse gas production. Three internal atria
connect the wings of the building and provide space for staircases,
lifts, and meeting rooms. The atria also act as thermal stacks to
enhance natural cross-ventilation.
Following an initial design by architects Building Design Partnership,
the Bovis team was appointed in 1992 to provide pre-construction
consultancy services. The company was subsequently appointed to design,
manage and construct the project through to its conclusion.

KIRSTEEN Exley showed again yesterday at Bathgate why she tops
Helensburgh's scorers list for the season when she netted to put them
through to their first national final, writes Joseph Dillon.
They beat Stronachs Aberdeen GS FP 1-0 with Exley scoring in 42
minutes, after having been put through by 17-year-old Alison Gilfillan,
to ensure the West District champions of their place in the final of the
Confined Cup on April 22 against Highland.
Kelso also had aspirations of qualifying for cup finals day but they
had not legislated for the brilliance of the Inverness side, Highland,
who won through 2-0 from goals by Jill Sharpe and Carron Pumphrey.
In the Torrie Stockbrokers National League on Saturday, Edinburgh
Ladies put a better reflection on their goal-difference column by
crushing Grange 14-2 to register their highest victory of the season.
This success was fashioned by Scotland and Great Britain centre
forward Rhona Simpson, who helped herself to eight goals, representing
her best haul since joining the club last season.
This triumph enables Edinburgh keep abreast of Western Klick
Photopoint and Bonagrass Grove at the top of the table.
Western continue to set the pace on goal difference after having
beaten Royal High Gymnasts, with Susan MacDonald scoring another hat
trick, while Grove beat Boroughmuir 3-0, Susan Fraser hitting a double.
In the lower divisions Menzieshill failed to win for the first time
this season but their scoreless draw at Melrose gave them the
second-division title. Results:
Saturday: Torrie Stockbrokers National League Division 1 -- Grange 2,
Edinburgh Ladies 14; Boroughmuir 0, Bonagrass Grove 3; Western Klick
Photopoint 5 Royal High Gymnasts 0; Heriot-Watt University 2, Western A

<HEADLINE>Kwik Save revamps Shoprite operations in a major campaign</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAN MCCONNELL</BYLINE>

DEEP-discounter Kwik Save has stepped up its Scottish campaign, with
the start of the massive re-launch of Shoprite's failed operations using
its own formula.
With a major investment programme under way, previously estimated at
#15m, Kwik Save is determined to top the 10% of the Scottish grocery
market which Shoprite commanded in its heyday.
Marketing director Nick Goss came north for the opening of revamped
stores at Hillington, Haddington and St Andrews, re-opened under the
Kwik Save name.
The stores feature about 3500 product lines, compared with Shoprite's
1000, which Kwik Save believes will make its Scottish invasion more
successful than that of its former rival, which has now retreated back
into its shell on the Isle of Man.
Shoprite announced the #53.1m sale of its 117 UK deep-discounting
stores and sites, 100 of them in Scotland, to Kwik Save late last year.
Since then, they have been trading under the Shoprite name, with Kwik
Save disposing of 12 non-trading stores.
Kwik Save, which has about 870 stores trading under its own name
throughout the UK, will continue most of Shoprite's Scottish operations.
However, a handful which are small, or which would otherwise be
competing with established Kwik Save outlets or revamped Shoprites, will
be disposed of.
Prior to last year's acquisition, Kwik Save was not a big name in
Scotland. It had only six stores, although it has since opened in
Hamilton and last week in Oban.
Scotland has also been a favoured expansion ground for supermarkets,
illustrated by last year's acquisition by Tesco of William Low, and
Sainsbury's rival bid attempt at the time.
Kwik Save, which began life in North Wales in 1965, has already
created another 900 jobs, through the doubling of the workforce in the
former Shoprite operations.
Mr Goss believes a further 1500 jobs could be created through further
expansion in Scotland, where it has earmarked 74 locations, including
re-siting plans for existing stores.
Kwik Save is convinced its heavy use of branded products, coupled with
its 130-strong ''no frills'' range, will allow it to cope with the
imminent German incursion.
Lidl already has a small presence in Scotland and Aldi, a well-known
name in England, has been lining up sites north of the Border.
Their philosophy is more akin to Shoprite's than Kwik Save's but,
given their expansion ambitions, they are obviously not intending to
leave as quickly as the Isle of Man group.

TOP seeds at the British Land British National Ski Championships, Emma
Carrick-Anderson and Sandra Wilson, arrived in Tignes yesterday with a
pair of good results achieved among Europe's better skiers.
Carrick-Anderson finished fourth in the French Championships giant
slalom while Wilson took a ninth place in Saturday's slalom in Morzine.
Emma's fourth place came even after making a mistake on the first run
and nearly falling, but she recovered to finish third-quickest on the
run.
In the slalom, she straddled a gate and was disqualified, but
Glasgow's Wilson took one of her best results of the season, setting
herself up for her title bid this week.
Electing not to compete in tomorrow's downhill due to a persistent
cold -- a choice also made by Dunblane's Carrick-Anderson, who missed
out on both yesterday's training runs -- 23-year-old Wilson has already
won a FIS Super-G this year and shares the role of favourite for the
overall British Combined championship.
Both the World Cup team's Bell brothers have elected not to race in
the downhill.
Defending downhill champion Graham is pursuing ranking points in a bid
to stay inside the world's top 40 to ensure Britain's quota of World Cup
places remains at two, and is racing in Les Arcs at the French
Championships.
0 Martin is expected on Wednesday, having been left no alternative but
to stay at home in Mortlake and look after his six-month-old daughter.
His chances of winning his record-breaking fourth title remain in the
lap of the weather gods. A severe blizzard is expected tomorrow, hence
the downhill has been rescheduled for today.
Living up to his mantle as Britain's downhill hope for the next
Olympics, Andrew Freshwater, 20, from Aviemore, was quickest in both
training runs yesterday and should lift his first British senior title
today.

EBONY and ivory were in perfect harmony at the World Cross-country
Championships. In a sporting world obsessed by sagas of sleaze -- of
bribery and corruption, of convicted thug footballers, and rapist boxers
-- it was refreshing to leave old Durham town to such an upbeat tune of
hope.
True, Britain's deficiencies were mercilessly exposed: the best UK
placing was Paula Radcliffe's eighteenth, in the senior women's race.
But sincere warmth between black and white rivals was an eloquent
emissary ahead of next year's event, being hosted in Cape Town, the
first athletic championship in the rehabilitated Republic of South
Africa.
Kenya claimed all four team titles at the Snickers-backed
championships on Saturday: the senior men's gold, through Paul Tergat,
and six of the 12 individual medals available. Ethiopia took the junior
men's and senior women's titles, plus three team silvers.
Yet Finnish teenager Annmarie Sandell proved it is possible to take a
title out of the hands of Africans, even if she had to join them to do
so.
Sandell received leave of absence from high school to spend the last
seven weeks living and training with the Kenyan team at their altitude
camp in Embu. A Finnish male athlete returned home, unable to cope with
5am reveille, and three daily training sessions of six miles each.
After having won by five seconds, Sandell, stereotypical Finn, pale
with golden hair, warmly embraced the contrasting Kenyans, her training
partners, who followed her over the line.
But the symbolism was lost on Sandell's coach, Lasse Olav Mikkelsson,
who leaned more to pragmatism: ''Our life is so easy, too many cars and
video games. In Kenya, they walk or run everywhere -- no cars.''
Ireland's Catherina McKiernan also beat the Kenyans, but was eight
seconds behind Olympic 10,000m champion Derartu Tulu.
Tulu won against the odds. She lost last year to a knee injury. This
time she overcame a nightmare journey from Ethiopia which wrecked the
hopes of men's world 10,000m champion Haile Gebresilassie.
Visa and financial problems saw the Ethiopians relieved of their
passports for security, and packed, several to a room, in an Athens
hotel on Thursday night. They pooled what they had to pay the bill, but
could afford no food.
Having been in transit since Wednesday, the team finally arrived in
London on Friday. No flights were available to Newcastle, so they made
the seven-hour, 300-mile trip by public bus, arriving at midnight, less
than 12 hours before the first race.
Yet when Tulu led the break which dispatched Radcliffe back through
the field, to finish broken and weeping, she exhorted McKiernan, in
English: ''Come on! Come on!''
McKiernan obeyed, and soon they were clear, alone, but only to be
rewarded with her fourth runners-up medal in as many years -- each
behind a different winner. Her placing, however, won the Worldcross
series outright, and its $10,000 prize.
''Bitter? How can I be?'' said the girl from County Cavan. ''How can
anyone handle Tulu on a day like this? But some day the sun will shine
for me.
''She was encouraging me to go with her. How can you feel angry with a
girl like that? But until I win, I'll keep trying.''
Tulu, runner-up to Liz McColgan for the 1991 world 10,000m title,
said: ''I love Catherina a lot . . . we are friends and rivals. We are
sisters.''
She could afford to smile, but compatriot Gebresilassie was in tears.
Fiercely critical of his federation, he said: ''They made two big
mistakes. They did not organise our travel properly, and they left out
three good men.''
The trio were dropped because they ran for money three weeks ago in
Italy. ''Otherwise we'd have won the team race for sure.''
As a consequence, Gebresilassie was left unsupported in the leading
group, facing Kenyan team tactics alone. He finished fourth, two places
ahead of European champion Paula Guerra, of Portugal.
Tergat -- in his native tongue his name means ''one who stands or
walks with head bent to one side'' -- stooped to conquer. He finished
eight seconds clear of Ismael Kirui, leading Kenya to their tenth
successive senior team title.
World 5000m gold medallist Kirui admitted to sacrificing himself to
set up Tergat with a late surge which Gebresilassie had little option
but to cover.
The IAAF, who gave Ethiopian officials more than sufficient funds to
bring the team, were horrified at the athletes' plight. ''If we
intervene, like we did in trying to bring Linford Christie to the indoor
championships earlier this month, we are accused of meddling,'' said
spokesman Chris Winner. ''If we stand clear, we risk seeing a champion
like Gebresilassie reduced to despair.''
The time for the opening 10,000m of the men's race, 28-22, was
achieved by just one UK track runner last year -- and this was on rough,
hilly ground. Such pace left Scots Tommy Murray and Robert Quinn
eighty-first and 100th respectively. Murray dropped 10 places in a
furious final 480m. But they performed creditably among 227 starters,
particularly given that Olympic 5000m champion Dieter Baumann was
ninety-second, and UK champion Spencer Duval 121st.

FORT William remained on course for a possible hat trick of cup
successes with a 3-0 fourth-round victory over Inveraray in the
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup.
The match was switched to Inverness on Saturday morning, when a string
of other pitches failed inspections.
Fort toiled for most of the first half against an impressive young
Argyllshire side and it was a minute into injury time before Dereck
Cameron forced the ball over the line.
Two goals in seven minutes in the first quarter of the second period
sealed Inveraray's fate and they had to make the long journey home with
nothing to show for a spirited performance.
Fort, meanwhile, go on to play Glenurquhart this weekend in the
quarter-finals and must now be considered strong favourites to contest
the final against Kingussie -- if they are kept apart in the draw for
the semi-finals, which will be made after Saturday' s ties.
The Glenmorangie Balliemore Cup final on April 15 will be an all-north
affair between Caberfeidh and Kilmallie. Results:
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup: Fourth-round (replay) -- Inveraray 0, Fort
William 3.
Glenmorangie Balliemore Cup: Semi-finals -- Caberfeidh 2, Tayforth 0;
Kilmally 4, Lochcarron 2.
North. Marine Harvest League: Division 1 -- Kingussie 8, Beauly 0;
Skye 1, Lochaber 1. Division 4 -- Strathglass 1, Lochaber 3.

Stirling County 15, GHK 13.
IT was the cliffhanger finish that no one could have scripted. Two
minutes to go and the reliable George Breckenridge steps up to take the
penalty goal which will ensure his side a place in the top flight.
That he pulled it wide and now West rugby will have just one
representative in division one is history. The fact remains that it
should never have come to this.
The Old Anniesland side left themselves with mission very difficult --
if not impossible -- to achieve, in travelling to Bridgehaugh needing
two points from champions Stirling County.
They gave it their best shot, and there were even whispers that County
might take a dive to ensure survival for their visitors from down the
road.
No danger. In a match strewn with errors and liberally punctuated by
the referee's whistle, the champions did just enough to win.
GHK have only themselves to blame. It used to be said they were a side
who dozed off for spells of a game, but this time they seem to have
spent half a season taking a nap.
Further internal strife in this most political of clubs has not helped
either, and one is left wondering at the wisdom of allowing player power
to reign when such dire straits were being navigated.
What must be said is that it should not have been left to George
Breckenridge, who has been re-born this season, to secure those vital
points so late in the day. Even Roy of the Rovers would have struggled
with that scenario.
It had not looked good for the visitors when Stewart Hamilton, whose
championship smile will have to be surgically removed, barged over for a
try from a series of short penalty moves.GHK had other ideas and, with
Alan Watt in rogue elephant mode with willing companions in his back row
colleagues, they fought back. Two penalties from Breckenridge were just
reward.
Steve Hirini, an influential part of the visitors' plans throughout,
made a telling break and Harry Bassi joined the line for a fine try
which Breckenridge converted.
A pushover try, touched down by Jim Brough, to which Mark McKenzie
added conversion points, put County within a point and with ten minutes
left McKenzie snatched the lead with a penalty.
County move on to bigger and better things, although we must hope they
manage to sort out chronic parking and stand accommodation problems,
while GHK can consolidate and sort out those internal difficulties.
Hold your head high, George Breckenridge, it sure wasn't your fault
they went down.

TOM Brewster and his Lockerbie team of Steve Still, younger brother
Ronald Brewster, and Peter Westwood struck gold in the world junior
championship in Perth last night, beating Germany 6-3 in a final which
rounded off a solid performance by the Scots throughout the week.
The Germans were the only team to beat the Scots in round-robin play,
which made last night's victory when it mattered even sweeter.
With last-stone advantage as the game started, Scotland elected to
blank the first two ends as the teams settled into the final. At the
third end, facing a German counter at the back of the house, Brewster
hit the German stone and rolled out to count 1 with another of his
stones that was just biting the 12 foot ring at the front of the house.
In the fourth end, third player Peter Westwood set up a good end for
the Scots. He played a well-judged double take out, and Brewster
followed this up with a good shot to lie 2, which he guarded with his
own last stone.
Germany attempted an ambitious roll off a stone on the wing, which
failed and gave the Scots a steal of 2.
A measure gave Germany two shots in the fifth end, but the Scots still
went into the break with a 3-2 lead.
In the sixth, the Scots were unfortunate not to score 2, when
Brewster's last stone stayed high and followed its German target out of
the house. This single pushed the Scots further ahead, and they
consolidated that lead with a steal at the next end, which followed an
attempted raise by the Germans which did not come off.
In the eighth, the Scots continued their good fortune when the German
skip chose to attempt to draw for two, rather than hit and stay. The
draw was too strong and the Germans were only able to take a single,
cutting the deficit to two.
In the ninth, Brewster eventually had a straightforward hit and lie
for a single, which he made to virtually kill off the match. The Germans
ran out of stones in the tenth end and conceded victory and the title to
Scotland by 6-3.
Although a sense of disappointment showed on their faces throughout
Saturday evening, Julia Ewart's team of Lucy Levack, Mhairi Ferguson,
and Catherine Grainger did well to make it to the semi-final, and only
an extra-end win by Canada 8-6 robbed them of a place in the final.
Canada went on to win the final against Sweden, again in the extra
end, but this time they required the umpire's measure to give them
victory by 6-5.
Less than an hour after their extended semi-final encounter, the Scots
women were back on the ice for their bronze-medal play-off and, unable
to raise their game sufficiently, they went down in this match to
Switzerland by 3-8. Results:

THE ''Get Big or Get Out'' mentality dominates UK dairying at present.
It has been suggested that there will be 25% less Scottish dairy farmers
by the year 2000. That farms have always got bigger in response to
economic pressure is well known.
Since 1984, however, getting bigger has involved a significant extra
cost -- milk quota. With recent large milk price increases encouraging
production, quota prices have soared as too many farmers chase too
little quota to cover the extra production.
Will the favourable milk prices continue? To answer this we must look
at the current situation.
The UK milk price has traditionally been low compared to most other EU
countries. Within the last two years or so, however, the UK has
leapfrogged to the top of the milk price league -- an outcome achieved
by the odd situation of prices rising in the UK while falling elsewhere.
Devaluation in 1992 and, most recently, deregulation, account for most
of the boost in UK milk prices. After ''Golden Wednesday'' UK products
became far more competitive both for the export and intervention
markets. Meanwhile the ending of the Milk Marketing Boards forced milk
processors into offering ''very competitive'' prices for raw milk to
guarantee supplies.
The probability is that milk pricing in the UK will undergo
significant change in the next few years. For over 60 years milk was
priced under a complicated system whereby the high price gained from the
liquid market was ''pooled'' with lower price from the commodity (cheese
and butter) markets. Under this system every farmer was offered the same
price irrespective of location or size. This pooled price system cannot
be sustained in the new deregulated market.
Milk prices are already under pressure. Processors selling milk into
the liquid milk market are obtaining their raw milk for around the same
price as before deregulation. For processors involved in manufactured
products, especially cheese, the price of raw milk has increased
significantly. With little opportunity to pass the higher price on to
consumers, these processors are under pressure.
The current high prices are therefore underpinned by the processors of
manufactured dairy products. This is unsustainable. Eventually the farm
price will have to reflect the value of the product for which milk is
used. If processors of low-value dairy products are to continue in
business they will have to source milk at a lower price. Significant
milk price differentials could therefore emerge in the future.
Gatt commitments are also likely to place downward pressure on milk
prices. Favourable world markets have reduced skimmed milk powder and
butter stores to historic lows. Nevertheless, the EU still produces too
much milk. Reducing EU production to the levels agreed in Gatt involves
cutting quotas and/or lowering the milk price.
With quota cuts politically difficult Brussels has slowly set about
reducing the attractiveness of the intervention market. If surplus milk
cannot readily be sold into intervention the producer price will fall to
clear the markets.
Thus the message is that dairy farmers making expansion plans on the
back of continued high milk prices should beware. The medium-term
prospects for milk prices are very uncertain.

KILMARNOCK SEVENS
THE Saltires coasted over the Bellsland mud in regaining the
Kilmarnock sevens trophy yesterday. The invitation clubs team, drawn
from Kirkcaldy, Boroughmuir, Ulster, and Bath, were too strong and pacy
for all their opponents, even Stirling County, the new Scottish
champions, whom the Saltires beat 28-17 in the final.
Derek Stark sent the Saltires on their way in the final with a try
from his own interception. The equally speedy Audley Lumsden added two,
and with Colin Wilkinson converting all three, the Saltires led 21-0
before Kenny Logan sparked a Stirling recovery.
Logan scored before and after the interval. Gareth Flockhart scored
later on, but between those two tries Neil Renton made victory safe
after the Saltires had pounced on loose ball. Wilkinson again converted.

England Schools Under-18 19,
Scotland Schools Under-18 14
SCOTLAND went down fighting with a battling performance against a
stronger English side in the schools international at Twickenham
yesterday.
Three penalty goals from winger James Cook gave England a 9-0 lead.
Danny Mallinson finally found his kicking boots to bring Scotland back
into contention with two well struck penalties, before flanker Nick
Outlaw gave Scotland their only try.
Although Mallinson missed the conversion, he more than made amends
with his third penalty success to send Scotland into half time with
their tails up and a 14-9 lead.
The last 35 minutes all proved uphill for captain Simon Hannah's team
though, as their advantage was wiped out five minutes after the restart.
England's backs and forwards combined cleverly to wear town the
tigerish Scotland tackling, and prop Michael Worsley crashed over from a
lineout on the Scottish goal-line. Cook slotted the conversion, and
extended England's advantage with his fourth penalty.

Dundee High School FP 11, Watsonians 27
''THERE is no way I will ever coach a side to play 10-man rugby'' was
Andrew Ker's emphatic commitment to the continuation of Watsonian's
policy of playing an expansive game. Having watched his side see off the
challenge presented by Dundeee a good deal less emphatically than the
scoreline suggests, Ker was adamant that Watsonians would maintain their
handling game in next season's premier division.
At times the Watsonian counter attacking from deep was breathtaking --
and this was without Gavin! Fergus Henderson, deputising at fullback,
had a grand game, however, always alert and willing to test the Dundee
defence with his sheer pace.
Watsonians have scores 30 tries in league games this season -- all bar
the very first by backs. Saturday's four were all crackers. Andrew Garry
created good field position with a classic shimmy and outside break, and
a quickly taken tap penalty allowed him to score, ''coming back against
the traffic''.
A scrappy Dundee lineout tap was swept towards their line by the
Watsonian back row and quick repossession and conventional handling put
John Kerr over.
Kerr added another try, grounding a delicately placed Duncan Hodge
chip through, and Graham Inglis showed a clean pair of heels in
gathering a slack Dundee pass and racing clear from halfway. Hodge
converted two of the tries and rekindled memories of his exploits
against the South African tourists at Melrose with a calmly taken drop
goal.
It was not by any means one-way traffic -- and Ker acknowledged that
Dundee were too good a side to be going down. On the day, however, they
were weaker at stand-off and fullback.
Young Gerry Tosh goaled two penalties but missed too many touch kicks
while Mark Lamont, although scoring a second-minute try, posed nothing
like the attacking threat of Fergus Henderson.
The Dundee pack, even without Stewart Campbell, but with the rolicking
and flambuoyant Tom Smith to the fore, repeatedly tore through the
visiting eight -- and very much in the mould of the national side,
sought to stay on their feet and lay the ball off. Scott Hastings,
halting one such sortie, was trapped on the Dundee side and was given
some 'foot treatment' before referee Eddie Murray awarded the penalty --
to Dundee.
A later penalty, initially awarded to Watsonians for the same offence,
was reversed -- and I believe correctly -- when hooker David Henderson's
footwork was deemed more of a stamp than a rake.
Dundee High School FP -- M Lamont; M Cousin, D Hamilton, P Rouse, J
Jardine; G Tosh, G Sandford; T Smith, G Scott, J Manson, R Walker, D
Newman, A Keys, D Milne, C Sampson.

<HEADLINE>Danger in crying 'wolf' over farm subsidies</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>18</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979189914</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DONALD MacRAE, the Trustee Savings Bank's senior manager for
agricultural services, attracted some flak earlier this year when he
issued a warning to farmers that they should begin to cut down their
reliance of subsidies.
Ministers and others have continued to make a virtue out of the fact
that big money is flowing into the industry from Europe.
In the coming year the various arable and livestock support schemes
will be worth about #350m to Scottish farmers. Last year the chief
beneficiary collected #340,000 and the average arable farmer got about
#20,000.
There is still a body of opinion, however, which argues that this
situation cannot continue for much longer. The real debate should be
about when rather than if changes will come.
Mr MacRae's latest economic bulletin returns to the theme with a
warning that it will become progressively more difficult for the
European Union to justify high levels of spending on farm policy if the
American version significantly reduces support levels.
''Of particular concern to Scottish farming politicians is the obvious
commitment by American farmers to an aggressive export policy,'' he
says. ''American exports of pigmeat, beef and cereals could be
competitive in European markets, if Gatt results in more market access
into the EU.''
The chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee, Mr Richard Lugar,
is said to be in favour of a policy of phasing out farm subsidies over a
period of five years. A recent farm survey of 15 farm states by the US
Department of Agriculture found some 40% of farmers supporting the
phasing out of deficiency payments. Two-thirds of those who responded
wanted more flexibility to react to market demand.
The most likely outcome from the present debate in America is a cut of
around 25% in farm support policy, says Mr MacRae. A reduction in
American farm support, he argues, would lead to more pressure for a
similar movement in Europe. Focusing support on small farms, with a
social policy objective, might alleviate American criticism and allow
the continuation of many EU policies.
Basically he stands by his argument that the next battle over EU farm
policy could be on where the cut-off point for aid should be applied. He
sees more money being directed to smaller farming units for social
rather than agricultural reasons.
Mr MacRae finds an ally in Fife farmer Gordon Rennie who has published
his observations on farming in New Zealand and Australia after a spell
as a Nuffield scholar.
Set-aside, along with direct payments to European farmers, can only be
interim measures to bring EU prices closer to ''world prices,'' he
believes. ''All the EU governments are now obliged to meet certain
conditions when the new Gatt rules come on stream. We must accept that
as time goes by it will be the market place, not the taxpayer, that will
earn us a living.''
Wheat growing in the vast dry plains of Western Australia, where
average yields are 1.14 tonnes a hectare, may seem hardly worth
comparing with British yields of 7.2 tonnes, he concedes. ''We receive
twice as much for our wheat at #100 a tonne and also receive an arable
aid payment of #141 a hectare for all cereals.
''The cold fact is that even with our yields, our prices and our
direct payments we are still totally unable to compete.''
Mr Rennie illustrates his point with a personal example. In 1993 he
won a national competition based on the lowest cost of production, his
crop yielded 13.10 tonnes a hectare and total production costs were #47
a tonne. A counterpart in Western Australia averaged yields of two
tonnes a hectare but at a cost of #41 a tonne.
''Unless we can guarantee yields of 13 tonnes a hectare we must take
heed of the Australian situation in our own attempt to drive costs
down,'' he says.
After viewing the Nww Zealand experience at first hand, he writes:
''One can have very little sympathy when one reads regular reports of
British farmers complaining that their subsidies have been cut, or their
payments have been late.
''I am as happy as the next man to take every subsidy going but I have
now seen how farmers elsewhere can survive without them. There have been
many forecasts of the demise of our own subsidies and I get the distinct
feeling that some in our industry have got so tired of the cry 'wolf'
that they might just be in for a nasty surprise.''

HERIOT'S 28-26 win at the Greenyards ensures that the Goldenacre club
will remain in the first division next season.
Heriot's, who have never dropped out of the top division, have been
inconsistent this season, but Saturday's results, including GHK's 13-15
defeat by champions Stirling County, left Glasgow without a
representative in Division 1. West of Scotland's defeat by the already
relegated Currie made sure that their place will be in the new Division
2.
Selkirk made a great effort to overtake Kelso's better points
difference to win the second division championship. They failed by only
six points after thrashing Corstorphine 58-16.
Further down the second division, wins by Glasgow Academicals, 35-16
against Kirkcaldy, and by Grangemouth, 26-6 against Gordonians, resulted
in their places in the new Division 3 being made secure.
Edinburgh Wanderers, who appear to be suffering from the amalgamation
talk with Edinburgh Academicals, lost at home to bottom club Haddington
44-15 and they and Gordonians are now relegated to the new Premier
Division 4.
The one promotion place that remained to be filled in Division 4 has
been occupied by Langholm, who inflicted the first league defeat of the
season on Ayr with a 6-3 victory.
At the bottom of Division 4, Edinburgh University's win over
Hutchesons'/Aloysians by 10-6 left the varsity team in the National
Division 1 and the Auldhouse club in Division 2.
The battle for the second promotion place out of Division 4 behind
Glenrothes resulted in a 19-19 draw between Livingston and Duns. The
clubs started the day level on points and ended up with the Border club
winning promotion by a better points difference.
The win by Madras College FP, 26-15 over league leaders Berwick, left
them with a chance of playing in National 3 but they must wait for the
result of next Saturday's game between Cumbernauld and Linlithgow. A win
by Cumbernauld would see them leap-frogging the St Andrews club.
At the bottom of Division 6, the postponed match between Aberdeen
University and Earlston will decide who plays National 5 and 6 next
season. Aberdeen have eight points, as have St Andrews University, who
have completed their programme, while Earlston have seven points. Two of
the clubs will play in National 5 and one in 6.
Moray require a win by more than 33 points in their final match
against Cumnock to claim a place in National 6 next season and leave
Broughton FP in National 7. List of league placings for next season:

WE left for our holiday in Kenya in the snows of mid-February. We
thought we were being so clever leaving the snow for the equatorial sun.
We'd miss the worst of the winter and come back to springtime --
surely Scotia's best season. Rejuvenated by resting and sunbathing the
Farmer would return with the lapwings from Africa and get on with the
calving and the spring work.
The reality is that he has returned exhausted from too much eating and
drinking, though the scars from the first-degree sunburns are healing up
nicely, to find that Little Ardo is still in the grip of winter.
The grass is brown and the oilseed rape, which was such a show when we
left for Africa is turning brown also as the hoards of starving pigeons
work their way round the place like a plague of locusts. On our first
night home we had four inches of snow.
Now, you could be excused for wondering how it is that the Farmer, who
always claims to be so busy, can horse off to Africa for five weeks,
even in mid-winter. Granted the crops aren't going to be doing much
beneath the snow, but who is going to look after the hundred head of
cattle?
The answer is Potions. The chemist who so loves to come and play at
farmies in his spare time has got his chance. Having married the elder
investment he is currently favourite to succeed me when the Breadwinner
and I move, as we intend, to the death house in four years time.
And he's fairly been earning his pole position.
He, the Investment and their own two little Investments moved into the
farmhouse for a dummy run. Potions had the chance to pose as laird of
the place, to wake up with a hundred cattle bawling at him for food and
ten thousand pigeons needing scared off theirs.
Of course, the farm is so well organised that that hardly constitutes
a full-time job -- and it's just as well.
You see, as is happening all over the place, the small shops in
Potions' village are feeling the competition from the super-duper
shopping centres. The old butcher was determined to retire and there
just wasn't a buyer who was willing to sell sausages.
This was a serious threat to Potions. If people went to the city for
their beef they might just get their toothpaste, deodorants and aspirins
at the same time. So he's bought the butchers.
Not content with finishing his apprenticeship as a farmer, he has
started from scratch as a butcher as well. That, with his duties at the
chemist's shop, means that Potions is a busy man.
During our African holiday he rose at six and chased his tail all day,
hardly even leaving time for a couple of pints before bed-time.
And he hasn't been content to do the minimum at the farm. There are
all sorts of little improvements he's managed to make. Like the new
fence round the wood at the bottom of the steading. He's made a nice job
of that. Posts every three yards instead of the five that has served me
well enough and seven wires where three would have done. Worse than that
it is all new posts, wire and even staples.
''What a hero!'' I hear you say.
Well, not altogether. Potions may be turning into what Mossie calls
''a workin feel'' but he's not a fool altogether. He sees that the more
he can get done when I am paying the better. And while I may be happy
with any rough job that will last for my remaining four years, it is in
his interest to make as good a job as possible.
So we have three nice new garden gates and a fine piece of new
concrete alongside his new fence. The enormous plain tree which for a
150 years has been doing its best to deprive the kitchen of the morning
sunlight, is away. In its place we have a surprisingly small pile of
logs.
All in all Potions has acquitted himself well as temporary farmer.
Nothing has died, seized, blown down or blown up. Five new calves have
been born. There has been no growth so we are not behind with any of the
sprays or fertilisations. In short, the Farmer has not been missed.
So should we just retire to the death house and let the young man have
his head while he is still young enough to enjoy it? Goodness knows, too
many lives have been blighted by being kept waiting too long for their
turn. Goodness knows how many in recent years have not had their turn at
all because the generation before didn't manage to stop before the money
went done and the farm had to be given up.
And yet I am reluctant to go. You see, now that young Potions has
proved himself able, now that his dander has been further raised by the
realisation that he can do it, and that farming is truly what he wants
to do above anything else, I have got him just where I want him.
After all, there is nothing in writing. He can't be quite sure of his
succession.
I should be able to have a few years yet on top of this hill. During
those years I will have plenty of cheap labour, the place looking well
after on my long holidays, and very few and very short arguments.
That doesn't go for Mossie, of course. There the boot is on the other
foot. As my honorary crops consultant he gets due deference, though he
does try my patience at times. Especially with those catchphrases. He's
got a new one: ''It's nae for me to say, but your crops are nae looking
as well as mine.''
At least it will make a change from ''this is the way forward'' and
''it's a giant step for mankind''.

GOOD news. Shade Munro, the 28-year-old GHK and Scotland second-row
forward, is to stay in Glasgow, having accepted a newly created post of
Rugby Development Officer in Glasgow. His post is joint-funded by the
city council and the SRU, and it puts an end to the rumours of his
impending departure to clubs south of the Border.
''I learned I had got the job a couple of days ago, and I'm delighted.
I start in a week's time,'' he said yesterday. ''I've been getting dogs'
abuse from everybody for maybe going to England, but I can safely say
that I had absolutely no intention of going there.
''I did sign registration forms in England, but that was to keep my
options open if I could not get a job, and I had to face the fact that I
might not have been able to get a job. Having said that, this is the job
I wanted, to be working in rugby. I look forward to the challenge.''
And the challenge, undoubtedly, will be immense. Glasgow is a city
dominated by soccer, the city now has no rugby teams in the top flight
of next year's premier leagues, and nobody from the city itself played
on the international pitch for Scotland in this year's Five Nations.
Kenny Logan and Ian Jardine are from Stirling.
All of it has happened, as well, despite the clubs in Glasgow getting
a series of Antipodean hired guns that could grace a Clint Eastwood
movie. Just like the old Park School dances, the local talent isn't
there.
That, I'm afraid to say, is a sorry state of affairs. You know my
views. I blame the old school tie for doing more damage than good over
the years but, luckily for the man capped six times for Scotland, that
is something he can ignore.
''I think that the important part of my job will be to help Ken
McEwan, the Glasgow Youth Development Officer, to get rugby going in
schools and clubs in and around the Glasgow area,'' says Munro. ''There
are 240 primary schools in Glasgow, and Ken has started New Image rugby
in 100 already, but it's keeping it going in these schools that will be
vital.''
Castlemilk -- where, if I may make so bold, many of the real people of
Glasgow live -- is a greater gathering of humankind than, for example,
Perth. Castlemilk, like Easterhouse, is a potential hotbed of rugby, and
it is being targeted. ''Ken McEwan is working in Castlemilk right now,''
says Munro, ''and his target is to have New Image rugby in every primary
school in Glasgow and establish links with senior schools from those
primaries.''
I bumped into Ian ''Chalky'' Gray -- now SNP candidate and teacher,
but once upon a time a ferocious second-row forward with Jordanhill --
at the Clydesdale District Sports Council awards on Saturday night and
found out that he now coaches Cumbernauld, a side doing well.
He says he has players that are good enough to get capped. He says
it's no wonder Glasgow clubs do badly -- they are soft and they don't
have the knowledge. He wasn't tearful at the news that GHK and West were
down. Perhaps we need more Chalky Grays in and around Glasgow. Perhaps
we need some hard thinking.
Part of Shade Munro's job will be to try to ensure that the kind of
rugby knowledge held in the darker recesses of the likes of Chalky
Gray's brain is spread not only to the youngsters that are to play, but
to the helpers who are going to coach.
''There's no doubt that some willing helpers put youngsters off
because they don't know what they are doing in coaching sessions,'' says
Munro. ''Much of my job will be to help coaches take on board fresh
ideas to keep them and the youngsters interested. The coaches need help.
''Then we will try to set up more junior clubs like Mount Vernon, and
expand the elite-performance groups, like the under-16s and under-14s,
so that the best players at that age get the best coaching.''
I think that it is a great idea appointing Munro to this task. Only he
can assess the long-term career progression in a coaching set-up in
rugby union. But Glagow's rugby problems, I believe, can be only partly
cured by the appointment of more Rugby Development Officers. The city
must start to pursue excellence in the sport.
Munro was there on Saturday to watch his team-mate George Breckenridge
kick wide at Stirling for GHK to go down. Next Monday he starts a job
with the sole intention of keeping Glasgow up at the top. We wish him
well.
I SEE a Welshman writing in one of the English Sunday papers says my
words on Brian Moore last Monday were a savage attack. Good.
I meant it. Moore deserved it. He was a disgrace to the game.

* DIRECTORS of the Cheltenham and Gloucester building society were
booed and slow hand-clapped on Saturday at an angry meeting called to
protest at the planned mereger with Lloyds Bank.
The special meeting, at Cheltenham Town Hall, was called by 100 rebel
members opposed to the merger plan.
They put forward four motions proposing other options to the
acquisition -- such as flotation of the society -- but all were lost by
between 14,000 and 16,000 votes at the end of the two-hour meeting.
The #1800m takeover of the society will mean a #500 cash payment and
an extra percentage bonus based on their savings for investors -- but
nothing for borrowers.

<TEXT>
A NUMBER of major High Street groups are considering bidding for
jewellery chains H Samuel and Ernest Jones.
The City believes their parent company Signet, the UK's biggest
jewellery group, formerly known as Ratners, is likely to sell soon if
bids are realistic.
The companies most likely to put in offers are thought to be Argos,
Next and Goldsmiths which confirmed last week it would be interested in
acquiring Signet's UK businesses for about #250m.
An imminent sale is thought likely following moves last week by US
preference shareholders to force a break-up of the former Ratners group.
Signet is weighed down by debts totalling #360m, much of which matures
in June but a break-up of Signet would release considerable value.
Julien Tregar who advises UK Active Value Fund, the biggest holder of
another class of preference shares and which is owed #50m, including
dividend arrears said last week: ''The time has come for some action to
stop the relentless fall in shareholder value.
''Since February 1994, shareholders have lost #100m in the market
value of their holdings in Signet and furthermore the company has
proposed no action to recitfy its capital structure.''
He believes the businesses if sold separately, could be worth about
#820m.
Last month, Signet's finance director Gary O'Brien and Nathan Light,
head of Sterling, its US chain, resigned.
Mr O'Brien is to join Salisbury's, the luggage and handbag chain.

<TEXT>
THE initiative by Allan Stewart MP (Conservative), to put forward an
additional clause for the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill is very
welcome (March 16). One of the obstacles said to block a trial in a
neutral country for the two accused Libyans is the difficulty under
existing Scottish criminal law of arranging for a court under Scottish
jurisdiction to sit in a neutral country.
UK Families-Flight 103 have long pressed for such a trial to be
facilitated, but there are other obstacles. Not the least of these
appears to be a reluctance on the part of the Lord Advocate and the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office to consider preparations for such a
venue.
Perhaps some statement could be made to clarify what their position
would be should such a clause become law.
Instead of trying to put the two on trial in Libya, as the Montreal
Convention provides, the Libyans say that the two would be allowed to
attend trial under Scottish law in a neutral country. To members of the
UK Families-Flight 103 this looks a reasonable compromise.
It is clear from other discussions with the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office that the UK authorities also fear that if a neutral-country trial
were to be offered, the Libyans would find some excuse for not coming.
Let us hope that that theory will be put to the test if Allan Stewart's
initiative is carried.

AS the developers of Pacific Quay we were most dismayed to read that
backers of the Tivoli Gardens concept claim the people of Govan will be
''short-changed'' on jobs at Pacific Quay (March 22). This flies in the
face of the facts.
As developers we are totally aware of and committed to the creation of
local employment opportunities for the surrounding communities. We have
already held a series of meetings with officials of Govan Initiative,
the local jobs and economic development agency, to explore how local
employment opportunities can be maximised.
We have also held meetings with representatives of local groups,
including community councils, at which local employment has always been
top of the agenda. This process of local consultation will continue
throughout the construction life of Pacific Quay.
Our estimate of 2000 full-time permanent jobs is, if anything,
conservative. Contrast that with the seasonal and casual employment
opportunities at Tivoli Gardens. In our opinion, there is no contest.
The Tivoli Gardens concept as a proposal is not viable.
This claim is a blatant attempt to stir up emotions in a community
which deserves real jobs and not false hopes.

WE wish to endorse Ruth Wishart's article, A testing time at night
class (March 20).
However, she does end with a suggestion that the customers should
stand up and be counted. There is already in existence an organisation,
Friends of the Department of Adult and Continuing Education (University
of Glasgow), which has over 1000 members, formed specifically to support
the department when the threat from the Scottish Higher Education
Funding Council became apparent, and it has been active in drawing
attention of various MPs to the situation.
We have seen what has happened in England and have no intention of
going down the same path. Above all, there is a need for a sensible
balance between credit-bearing and non-credit-bearing courses.
One point perhaps overlooked by Ruth Wishart but of great importance
to many people is the vast geographical area covered by courses. Classes
are held from Oban to Stranraer and these are full courses, not single
lectures as are provided in rural areas elsewhere in Scotland.

A clear 'first' for Scotland
AS an Irishman may I correct an erroneous date in your report on
Christie's sale of books from the Marquis of Bute's library (March 16)?
The first book printed in Irish in Ireland (John Kearney's Irish ABC and
Catechism) was printed in Dublin in 1571 and not 1517.
John Carswell's translation into Gaelic of John Knox's Book of Common
Order was published in Edinburgh in April, 1567. In view of the fact
that Irish and Gaelic were then virtually identical in their literary
form, this was a clear ''first'' for Scotland.
Kearney, originally from Sligo, graduated in Cambridge in 1565 and
later served as a minister of the Reformed (Anglican) Church in Dublin.
Of the original 200 copies of his book thought to have been printed,
four are known to have survived. The three others are in the British
Library, the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and the library of Lincoln
Cathedral.

I ENJOYED Jack Webster's article and the obvious affection he holds
for his father's memory (March 20). I have a similar attitude for my
father and the memories of my childhood.
He was a quiet man, with a mischievous humour. He fought and was
wounded in the First World War.
With my mother he had 13 children. As the tenth, I often am thankful
the pill was not invented earlier.
He worked, after coming out of the army, for 37 years until he was 62,
when he developed blindness -- just a decent working man, with a limited
education, who with my mother did their best on the wages he got as a
pug-locomotive driver at the Dalmarnock Power Station.
People like my father and Jack Webster's father never got, nor sought,
the limelight, but nowadays the media seek to portray as important to
humanity such mad, murdering gangsters as Ronnie Kray, and no doubt we
will be saturated with film and print showing other old gangsters and
their molls, walking with respectful bowed heads and giving interviews
(probably for pay) to TV and press.
We have all heard young people raving about the string of banal,
mediocre, personalities of recent times, but when you challenge exactly
what they have ever contributed to the human race, you get replies like:
''Well, look how rich they are'' or ''They do a lot for charity''.
Little wonder we have wails about the breakdown of society.

CURRENTLY some HNC business students are examining the increasingly
important issue of sexual harassment in the workplace; a theme developed
from The Herald's coverage of a tribunal case involving a firm of
financial consultants recently found not guilty of sexual harassment.
Having uncovered the case of Porcelli v Strathclyde Regional Council
(1986), the students equally found the letter by Mr McLellan (March 17)
of interest, especially when they made comparisons with the case of the
woman PC recently sexually harassed by officers of Strathclyde region's
police force.
As one student commented: ''Surely a local authority which claims to
be an equal opportunities employer should not become involved in
expensive court cases which they end up losing anyway.''
Clearly the student makes a valid point, but at the end of the day
it's individual lives and careers that are being destroyed by
unnecessary harassment and victimisation. One would not, therefore,
expect public money to be used in the defence of such action.

I AM mystified by your political editor's comment about Tony Blair
''dispatching the Bennite Marxist left'' and rescuing the Labour Party
from the ''false historical perspective'' of a ''Marxist intellectual
analysis'' (March 23).
Tony Blair no more understands Marxism than the late John Smith or any
previous Labour leader and is therefore quite unable to offer any
informed criticism of it.
The greatest weakness of the Labour Party leadership has always been
that it has no real understanding of the workings of capitalism and is
therefore at the mercy of capitalist economic developments when, and if,
it comes to power.
The importance of the old Clause IV -- however felicitously or
infelicitously worded -- was that it stated the intention to try to
control capitalism.
The power of transnational capital, flashing round the world in
trillions per day, is such that a Labour Government would be quite
incapable of pursuing any policies the money managers didn't like.
They're in the game for profit and would trash Mr Blair's flimsy notions
about community.
I would like to offer Mr Blair a friendly word of advice, for he is
obviously a decent man. Dishing out moralistic lessons, with proposed
sanctions, to the citizenry has been part of the stock-in-trade of every
fascist dictator from Hitler (Kinder, Kirche, Kuche for women) through
Franco to Peron. He really ought to check carefully the sort of water
he's dipping his toes in.

Wards: 70. Pop: 147,900.
The regional council with twice as many seats, but little likelihood
of any single party taking overall power.
12: EAST DUNBARTONSHIRE
Wards: 26. Pop: 110,220.
Merger of Tory-run Bearsden and Milngavie, and Labour-controlled
Strathkelvin, with LibDems and possibly SNP adding to an unpredictable
mix.
13: DUNDEE
Wards: 36. Pop: 153,710.
The existing city wards have been redrawn, with areas moved to
neighbouring districts, but Labour should hold on to power comfortably.
14: EDINBURGH
Wards: 58. Pop: 441,620.
The capital remains intact but gains six new seats. Labour will hope
to retain control, but the other parties all have strong claims.
15: FALKIRK
Wards: 36. Pop: 142,610.
Few changes to the existing district, although the SNP has ambitions
of toppling the Labour administration.
16: FIFE
Wards: 92. Pop: 351,200.
The largest number of councillors in Scotland, with Labour highly
likely to have a clear majority.
17: GLASGOW
Wards: 83. Pop: 623,850.
Labour is certain of victory, leaving a four-way battle for second
place. Could Scottish Militant become the official opposition?
18: HIGHLAND
Wards: 72. Pop: 206,900.
A traditional bastion of Independent rule, but all of the main parties
hope to increase their representation.
19: INVERCLYDE
Wards: 20. Pop: 89,990.
No real change to the existing district, so Labour should keep power.
20: NORTH LANARKSHIRE
Wards: 69. Pop: 326,750.
A combination of Motherwell, Monklands, and Cumbernauld and Kilsyth,
all currently ruled by Labour.
21: SOUTH LANARKSHIRE
Wards: 74. Pop: 307,100.
Merger of Clydesdale, East Kilbride, and Hamilton, along with
Cambuslang/Rutherglen from Glasgow. Another safe Labour banker.
22: EAST LOTHIAN
Wards: 18. Pop: 85,640.
Few changes to the existing authority, where Labour has a narrow lead
over the Tories.
23: MIDLOTHIAN
Wards: 15. Pop: 79,910.
The current council stays in place, as will the Labour administration.
24: WEST LOTHIAN
Wards: 27. Pop: 146,730.
The contest for three new seats will add to a keenly-fought battle
between the SNP and Labour for control.
25: MORAY
Wards: 18. Pop: 86,250.
Independents control the authority at present, but the SNP has hopes
of success in the heartland of parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing.
26: PERTHSHIRE AND KINROSS
Wards: 32. Pop: 130,470.
Two seats have been added to the existing council, which is Tory-run.
However, the SNP believes it can wrest power by repeating last year's
regional results.
27: EAST RENFREWSHIRE
Wards: 20. Pop: 86,780.
Five Barrhead seats are transferred from Renfrew to the Tory fiefdom
of Eastwood. This council is probably the Conservatives' best chance of
control.
28: RENFREWSHIRE
Wards: 40. Pop: 176,970.
The loss of five seats to the east will not help Labour, but it should
be able to ward off SNP's advances.
29: STIRLING
Wards: 22. Pop: 81,630.
Scotland's most closely-contested authority gains two new seats. Tory
and Labour shared the spoils in 1988 and 1992, and a card-cut may be
needed again.
(The three island councils -- Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney --
remain as unitary authorities, and will not hold elections next month.)

LET'S look forward for a moment. It is the week after the first
elections for the 29 new single-tier councils in Scotland.
In a temporary council chamber, somewhere in the central belt, the
recently elected members of the ''West Ochils Council'' have gathered
for their first meeting.
Elsewhere in the area the old two-tier region and district structure
is still responsible for delivering all the local government services.
Our fictional West Ochils is a shadow authority until April 1, 1996,
when it will become fully operational. Its ''shadowy'' existence means
that many of its members will also continue to serve for a year on the
outgoing regional and district authorities. Some, however, are entering
a completely new political environment.
At the first meeting the local returning officer, who declared the
elections results the week before, briefly takes the chair until the
election of a convener (although the council can give the post another
title) who will preside over meetings of the new authority.
He is a member of the political group which won a majority at the
local poll.
The meeting also appoints an interim clerk, in this case a retired
senior council official, who will be responsible for recording the
business of this first historic meeting and can also give advice on
procedures.
He or she will see the council through in this respect until the new
chief executive is appointed.
On the agenda also is the election of a strategy or executive
committee, which will have the same political balance as the council.
Members of this committee will meet very soon to open the sealed
envelope from the Staff Commission containing the applications for the
chief executive's post.
Making this vital choice is now the major priority for the new
councillors.
And we must not forget that West Ochils and the other new authorities
will probably need a temporary finance officer, who can get the
council's bank account ticking over and can arrange payment for the
councillors of their basic yearly allowance of around #5000 a year.
The Government is providing starter funding of #36m for Scottish
councils to help meet the cost of reorganisation, so the 29 authorities
can expect to share that, divided up on a pro rata population basis.
So much for that first meeting. There are now just around 50 weeks to
go until the shadow councils have to be ready and able to take over the
provision of all local government services in their area from education,
social work and transport to running libraries and collecting the
rubbish.
All the new councils must decide on their organisational structure --
how many committees -- can they be streamlined -- and get their chief
officials into place. As well as internal structures and closely bound
up with them, some sort of ethos or philosophy will have to be
established as the members in control and the officials decide just what
sort of local authority each is going to be.
It is expected that, as senior staff are appointed, they will have to
resign from their current posts in order to concentrate on their new
roles. There is the possibility that key helpers will be seconded and
dual appointments made during the hand-over year.
Many staff directly involved with service delivery, however, will not
transfer to the new authorities until April 1, 1996.
The level of services to be delivered will have to be agreed as the
council learns how much the Scottish Office thinks it should be spending
and how much will be grant-aided.
Can a small authority deliver all the specialist services itself, or
will it have to try and buy them in from a larger neighbour or the
private sector?
In many areas early decisions will have to be taken in conjunction
with adjoining councils about what is to happen to direct labour
organisations previously operated on a regional basis. Are they to be
broken up or can agreement be reached between the new councils in an
area to keep them going and allow them to continue bidding for council
service contracts.
A budget and council tax level for 1996-97 will have to be agreed
before the council takes full power on April 1 next year.
There will be important, and often sensitive, decisions to be taken in
many areas about where the new authorities are to meet. Will district or
regional buildings be used and will some municipal property be put up
for sale?
Mechanisms will also have to be established with the outgoing
authorities to ensure that thousands of staff are transferred as
smoothly as possible to the new councils by April 1, 1996.
In some areas, for example, present regional staff will have to be
allocated between a number of new single-tier authorities.
The whole operation is being monitored by the special Staff Commission
appointed by the Secretary of State. There has also been uncertainty
over whether or not the TUPE regulations (legal protection for
employees' rights) will apply. Even if they do and all the staff who
wish to do so transfer to the new councils with the same pay and
conditions, the new authorities are not legally obligated to retain them
all.
Good working relationships will also have to be established between
the new councils and local organisations such as the health boards, the
local enterprise companies and with voluntary organisations who are
seriously concerned about the continuing level of their funding.
During the transitional year the emphasis will slowly transfer to the
new councils, but the old authorities will be legally responsible for
providing the services until the end of March 30, 1996.
Like many others in local government, Lothian region's chief
executive, Tom Aitchison, believes the timetable for change is
exceedingly short. Everyone will have to work very hard, he says, to
ensure that the credibility of the new councils is established as
quickly as possible.
The Lothian chief told his staff in a house magazine recently: ''I
know we are going to have an extremely difficult year ahead.
''I have been through a number of significant changes in local
government and have first-hand experience of the great capacity and
commitment of local government staff.
''Above all else, we all must ensure that there will be no adverse
impact on services to the public and that the new authorities get off on
the best possible footing.''

IT is nearly 20 years since Derek Jacobi shot to popular acclaim
through his television portrayal of the stammering Emperor Claudius,
just one of the strange assortment of enigmatic characters he has
collected over the years. ''I'd hate to think that I only did what I
thought I could do,'' he told me. ''Parts come along and I have a go at
them though I do seem to have got into a religious rut lately and been
stuck in the cloth a bit.''
For the next few weeks he's swopped the bald pate of the medieval
mystery star, Brother Cadfael, for the triple tiara of Hadrian VII. The
production is touring before ending up at Chichester Festival Theatre
where Jacobi has just agreed to be artistic director.
Hadrian VII, by Peter Luke, is a dramatisation of the
semi-autobiographical work by the English novelist Frederick William
Rolfe, converted to Roman Catholicism in 1885 and shattered by his
rejection for the priesthood by the Scots College in Rome.
''It's a deeply intellectual play,'' says Jacobi, ''about a man who
believed that he had a divine gift but was forced to earn his living by
photography, writing, and journalism among other things, and would never
use his own name because that name was sacred to him. Some day, after
all, he would surely become a priest and be known in the priesthood by
that name. So he adopted pseudonyms.''
BUT Rolfe's blurred perception of the distinction between fact and
fiction was soon exposed by an article in the Aberdeen Daily Free Press
which mercilessly caricatured aspects of his life, appearance, and
character, as ''Baron Corvo''.
''In the play he fantasises that he is unexpectedly chosen for the
papacy. As Pope he institutes various reforms and sells the Vatican
treasure, and the play contains many fascinating things about the
Catholic Church. There are a lot of jokes, too -- it's not a
particularly heavy evening -- but it does make you think and makes you
realise that you're joining someone on a very emotional journey. He's a
deeply angry man at the beginning of the play and vents his vitriol on
the Catholic Church and I suppose it could upset some people.''
Jacobi says he's not particularly religious but, he quips, ''It is a
nice, light, easy costume!
''It's a challenging play for both the actors and the audience but
Terry Hands made this production very simple with just two sets, one
black and one gold, and we go seamlessly from one to another with no
stopping along the way.''
There really is no stopping for Jacobi, who is on stage for
practically two hours but relishes the experience. ''I like those parts
that challenge you and for which there are no safety nets. If anything
goes wrong everyone sitting out there sees it go wrong or hears it go
wrong and that's exciting and terrifying.''
* Hadrian VII opens at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, tonight and runs
to Saturday.

Paul Bassett, new Mayfest director, gives a preview of this year's
events and explains the thinking behind his fresh-look festival
WHY are Donnie Burns and Gaynor Fairweather on the front cover of the
Mayfest '95 programme? Well, they are the best in the world -- 11 times
world Latin dance champions in fact. And Donnie was born and taught to
dance in and around Glasgow -- hence the title Coming Home for Donnie
and Gaynor's Mayfest show for 3000 people.
But the main reason is that they are thrilling to watch live,
especially as they are dancing to a full orchestra (led by Andy Ross,
another native coming home for this event) and chorus.
Coming Home is the centrepiece of a weekend of Mayfest music and dance
which includes Mary Chapin Carpenter at the Concert Hall, Terry Neason
and the Paragon Ensemble (two more Glasgow talents) at the King's, eight
of the best new Glasgow bands at Barrowland, KKKKKing Tut's Rock
Weekend, Strictly Ballroom at Glasgow Film Theatre and the RSNO Allander
Ensemble at the Cottier and later the Michael Nyman Band and Fats Domino
at the King's. What's more, Scottish Opera are giving a free concert,
Sound Bites, and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra a performance of
Benjamin Britten's War Requiem.
These last two events will, like Donnie and Gaynor's show, be in the
Harland and Wolff shed in Govan -- a particularly appropriate venue for
the Britten piece.
This commemoration of the Second World War also offers a balance to
the previous Mayfest weekend which marks the 50th anniversary of Victory
in Europe with big celebrations at the Barras, two VE night dances at
Barrowland and the Plaza, plus another Paragon Ensemble/Mayfest venture
called War Ends in Europe!
I mention these events not only as examples of the approximately 600
performances of the 130 or so shows and events presented by Mayfest, but
also to give some notion of the ideas behind this year's festival.
One of these ideas has been collaboration; Mayfest is working with
people in this part of the world who have the talent, ideas, and ability
to produce exciting performances and events for Glasgow's festival.
Collaboration comes in different forms. For some events the Mayfest
team is running practically the whole show -- for example, with the
Mayfest Club at the Old Fruitmarket, the children's festival,
Paraphernalia, at the Mitchell and the programme at the King's and
Harland and Wolff shed. Other events are joint efforts -- such as the
shows at the Tron, Cottier and Arches, some of them chosen by Mayfest
some by the venues themselves. And many of the bands are directly
presented by DFC and other music promoters, with Mayfest underwriting
them on commercially viable ''cutting edge'' gigs.
Of course, it hardly matters, from the public's point of view, who
does what in organising a show.
I hope, however, that the results of the countless telephone calls,
meetings, discussions, negotiations, and bowls of soup at Cafe Gandolfi
prove more attractive for both audiences and participants than if we had
gone it alone.
Some collaborations come completely out of the blue. For example, we
had a phone call from someone at Scottish Opera to discuss not the
aforementioned Sound Bites freebie at the Shed, but a dance event for
Mayfest. By day, Jean Sutherland happens to work at the opera's finance
department but at night she teaches dancing.
Now, this dance event may -- like Donnie and Gaynor -- not be the kind
of dancing some people associate with an ''arts'' festival. Did you know
that there is a network of teachers, classes, and competitions involving
thousands of people in the West of Scotland who put heart, soul, time,
and money into disco dancing?
So, following that first phone call and after many negotiations with
the disco-dancing world, we have hired the SECC to be awash with sequins
and glitter as 2000 competitors and spectators take part in the Mayfest
Discorama '95.
The various collaborations have led us to another idea behind this
year's Mayfest -- investment in Glasgow's own cultures. We hope that
people with burgeoning talents in all fields of the arts and
entertainment will see Mayfest as their showcase.
In theatre, for example -- to choose just one of the 37 Glasgow-based
companies opening new shows at Mayfest -- we are helping to fund Theatre
Cryptic for a new play. The company's director, Cathy Boyd, assisted by
Quebec House and the British Council, has been to Canada to audition
performers from over there to work with Glasgow-based actors in a newly
commissioned piece by Michele Roberts, Child-Lover, at the Tramway.
Although these are some of the guiding ideas for Mayfest '95, in the
end there are no rules and no categories. The word ''community'' is all
but banned from the Mayfest office -- no separate section at the back of
the brochure.
Everything is together, big or small, city centre or beyond. In the
same way, we have tried where possible to avoid pigeon holes like
''classical music'', ''theatre'', ''dance'', and so on. This is largely
to organise the brochure in what we hope will prove an audience-friendly
way on a day-to-day basis.
Collaboration involves audiences too. Mayfest belongs to Glasgow --
and to its people. The different types of events are intended to give as
many people as possible the widest range of choice we can manage in
this, the first year under the new team.
Another way of fulfilling this is to present Mayfest shows in
big-performance venues (the 1000-plus seaters) -- the Pavilion, the
King's, the Shed, Barrowlands, the SECC, the Concert Hall, and so on --
as well as places throughout and beyond the city, on the street and by
the river. The idea is to allow people to feel part of Mayfest and not
feel that they are having culture imposed upon them.
A further route to large, popular audiences is our attempt to keep
ticket prices as low as possible. Nearly all the events cited here will
cost under #10, and those for which Mayfest is directly responsible #5
or less. This is not only to help keep things accessible to a broad
public but also to encourage people to try the unknown and the unusual.
Maybe it will also leave enough money in people's pockets to allow
visits to several events in a short period. We have also tried to
concentrate performances around the four weekends of Mayfest, the times
most people go out. Certainly we don't intend Mayfest as a cultural
marathon for the existing arts audience only.
Part of Mayfest's role is also to bring extraordinary shows from
abroad -- though perhaps we are a bit more sparing in our choices than
in the past. There are just six specifically Mayfest-invited works from
other countries, including the Abbey Theatre, two companies from France
and the Compagnie Yvette Bozsik from Hungary.
A local veteran writer told me just after I took over at Mayfest last
summer: ''Only bring productions from abroad to show us things we're not
doing here'' and I tend to agree. But again, there are no rules -- for
example Needles and Opium from Canada, which opens Mayfest's programme
at the King's, gets through on any criterion. I'd like to think that
someone who has never stepped inside a theatre before would pick up on
its amazing visual sophistication and the refreshing way it presents
images and a story.
Finally, I hope that Mayfest will be, in the literal sense of the
word, extraordinary.

Keith Sinclair reports on plans to restore the Forth and Clyde Canal
to its former glory as a national asset
PLANS for an ambitious #100m refurbishment of Central Scotland's canal
network which have received widespread support from public and
private-sector bodies are among the leading contenders for vital
Millennium Commission funding, according to the organisers.
British Waterways, which has admitted that the Millennium Link
proposals to refurbish the network between Bowling on the Clyde and
Grangemouth on the Forth will succeed only if it can secure #50m of
Millennium Commission funding, says it is delighted with the response to
the plans from bodies such as the Scottish Office, Scottish Enterprise,
and local authorities.
British Waterways claims the proposals to restore the canals, with
part-funding from money raised from the National Lottery, would create
4000 jobs and a ''corridor of opportunity'' for 80% of the Scottish
population and would attract more than #250m of private-sector funding.
The team headed by British Waterways is to make its submission for the
funding by the end of April, on completion of a #300,000 feasibility
study which began before their plans were unveiled last October. A
decision by the nine commissioners is expected later this year.
One of the key conditions laid down by the Millennium Commission,
which will choose about 12 major schemes from a list of 250, is that the
proposals must enjoy support from local authorities, local enterprise
companies, and local communities.
Project manager James Stirling, the general manager of British
Waterways Scotland, said: ''Almost all of our meetings with bodies such
as local authorities and LECs have been very positive. Some responses
have been guarded, and I respect other people's own aspirations and
priorities, but the positive response means that these people will come
on board and put the funding package together.''
He added: ''I am now completely confident that, with 50% funding from
the Millennium Commission, the Millennium Link can and will be achieved
by the end of the century and will deliver the enormous potential which
has been identified.''
Hopes that the project would go forward with the joint blessing of
Glasgow and Edinburgh were dashed when Glasgow District Council Labour
leader Pat Lally expressed misgivings about the proposals when they were
unveiled last October, but Mr Smith said the council was co-operating
with the British Waterways team.
However, Mr Stirling said: ''I have spoken to Councillor Lally since
then and, if we get Millennium funding, Glasgow District Council is
right on board with this. It's all conditional on us getting that
funding, but Glasgow District will be a full member of our partnership
and will probably contribute in terms of money and staff.''
Mr Tim Noble, executive director of British Waterways Scotland, added
that he did not believe the support of local authorities would be
adversely affected by local government reform.
He said: ''The introduction of shadow authorities will be a
complication but no more than that. The same people will mainly be there
and we don't see any difficulty in dealing with the new authorities
compared with the old. Nor do we see any change in policies.
''We lose Strathclyde Region which has been very supportive but the
planners and executives there will be part of the new authorities.''
The potential for canals acting as a catalyst for regeneration are to
be discussed at a conference at Strathclyde University tomorrow.
Speakers at the conference, which is being sponsored by Scottish
Enterprise, Grimley International Property Consultants, and the
Millennium Link, will include Mr Roger Crofts, chief executive of
Scottish Natural Heritage, and Mr Terry McGovern, marketing manager of
the Shannon-Erne Waterway in Ireland.

British Federation of Film Societies top award for its 1994 programme at
the annual Spring Film Preview Day held by the Scottish branch of the
federation at Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel. The society won the prize for
best film selection and other Scottish winners were Linlithgow Film
Society for its community development programme and Edinburgh
University's Film Society, named as best student film society.
This is the second time that the Ayr and Craigie Film Society has won
the national award for their film selection. The society has been in
operation for 22 years, and now present a programme of 18 titles between
the months of September and March at the Craigie Campus of Paisley
University.
Their winning selection included titles from Britain, Europe, and
beyond, with films as diverse as British director Ken Loach's social
drama Raining Stones, Woody Allen's Manhattan Murder Mystery, Italian
award-winner Mediterraneo and the Hollywood classic Camille.
Around 300, volunteer-run film societies are affiliated to the BFFS,
which first announced the winners at its national award ceremony at the
National Film Theatre earlier this month.
Also presented yesterday were awards given by the Scottish section of
the BFFS to Linlithgow Film Society for service to the whole community
and to Edinburgh University Film Society for programming and
presentation.

WHEN the Local Government etc (Scotland) bill became law last November
3 the Scottish Secretary Ian Lang claimed its implementation would
transform Scottish local government.
It would remove the bureaucracy and confusion of the present two tier
regional and district system and would replace it with new unitary
authorities which would be efficient accountable and cheaper to run he
said.
Mr Lang insisted there had been widespread support for single tier
councils over a considerable number of years.
His political opponents -Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the
SNP-however still remain bitterly opposed to the changes.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson told a recent local
government conference that the reorganisation was unwanted, costly and
ill-conceived. It was not based on a desire for more efficient more
accountable government but on an attempt to create safe local havens for
the Scottish Tories he claimed.
The new council system, he insisted, would not be single tier but
would be a multi tier, multi-layer patchwork of councils with a
proliferation of joint boards and quangos running local services.
Despite such hostility, even if Labour wins the next General Election,
the new system is likely to be with us for some time. The party plans to
appoint an independent commission to examine the future arrangements for
local government which would report back to the planned new Scottish
Parliament. It seems highly unlikely that a full two tier structure
would be reinstated alongside the new Parliament.
The Tory reorganisation bill spent about a year in Parliament, with
over 200 hours of debate, and was the lengthy culmination of an even
longer gestation process for the hotly disputed changes.
A first Government consultation paper ''The Case for Change'' had been
issued in 1991 asking for views on the principle of a move to single
tier local government.
A second paper was issued in October 1992 offering three possible
shapes for the new structure. They were a 35 unit structure, one with 24
councils and another with 15.
The final new arrangement which emerged has 29 mainland single tier
councils with the three islands authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles continuing as unitary councils.
During the bill's Parliamentary stages the government had agreed to a
number of changes to council boundaries which increased the originally
proposed 25 councils to 29.
The major ones were to allow Berwickshire to become part of the new
Borders authority instead of linking with East Lothian and the creation
of seperate councils for East, Mid and West Lothian.
Ministers also agreed there should be three Ayrshire councils instead
of two and accepted seperation for Clackmannan and Falkirk which had
originally been joined.
Of the councils being created four correspond to the area of an
existing region namely Highland, Borders, Dumfries and Galloway and
Fife. 12 correspond to the area of an existing district, seven to the
area of an existing district with a a part of it removed or with part of
an adjoining district added.
Six correspond to the area of two or three existing districts, two
with parts removed and two with part of an adjoining district added.
The new councils vary enormously in size from the city of Glasgow with
a population of just over 627,000, according to 1992 figures, to tiny
Clackmannan with just over 48,000. Geograpically the new Highland
authority is by far the most far flung containing almost two fifths of
Scotland's land mass.
One of the major upheavals is in Strathclyde where the two tier system
which covers half of Scotland's population is being replaced by 12
single tier authorities.
The transitional timetable goes like this.
Elections held all over mainland Scotland on April 6 will bring into
being ''shadow'' local authorities.
They will then run in tandem with the old 9 regional and 53 district
councils for a year in order to give them time to set up their new
organisations and plan for the changeover of service provision and
staff.
As part of the reorganisation, regional council responsibility for the
reporters to childrens' panels will be replaced by a new Scottish body,
the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration which will be
established on April 1 1996.
The regional and district councils will remain responsible for
delivering all the services until March 31 1996.
They have already set their budgets for 1995-96 and the council tax
for that year. For the financial year which begins on April 1 1996 the
level of council tax will be set by the new authorities.
As a result of the reorganisation and the arrival of single tier local
government the number of elected members will be reduced by about a
third to a total of 1,161.
The electoral wards for most of the new councils will be based on
district council wards. Most reflect the new wards which emerged from
the recent review conducted by the Local Government Boundary Commission
for Scotland. There will still be one councillor for each ward.
In Highland it was eventually decided to combine two district wards to
make one new ward or in a few cases to allow large rural wards to stand
on their own.
There have been strong claims from the Opposition parties that the
whole reorganisation exercise has amounted to a large-scale gerrymander
of boundaries to try to keep some safe Conservative local government
havens.
But with the Government's unpopularity nationally still at such
unprecedentedly high levels the ultimate irony may be that under the new
system they created the Tories are likely to end up holding even fewer
council than they do at present.
Opposition to the changes also centred around the Government's plan to
remove water and sewerage services from council control.
It was claimed ministers had intended to privatise them on the English
model but the eventual decision was to set up three public water
authorities whose board members would be appointed by the Scottish
Secretary. In fact three new quangos were born.
One school of thought suggested this was what Mr Lang had wanted to
achieve all the time but Labour especially claimed a famous victory and
insisted their campaigning, public opinion and the Strathclyde Region
referendum on the future of water services, had stopped full scale
privatisation.
Hailing the new regime for water and sewerage services last November
former Scottish Local Government minister Allan Stewart said the
Government had provided a framework in which new authorities would be
able to put in place the #5b investment needed to meet EC standards and
other committments.
Opposition politicians were furious more recently when it was
announced that the three part-time chairmen of the new water authorities
would receive combined salaries of over #100,000.
Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP along with the Labour-led
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities have refused to make any
nominations for membership of the new water authorities.
The new water authorities will assume full control of the services on
April 1 1996.

HE may have been away for over three months, but the minute principal
conductor Walter Weller walks back through the door the change in the
Royal SNO is immediate and comprehensive. It's subtle as well: they play
reasonably for many other conductors, but there's a rare sense of
confidence and unanimity when Weller's at the helm -- an indefinable mix
of craft and magic that lifts the band's playing.
And it didn't half do just that on Saturday night, lifting ultimately
the roof. Weller doesn't just beat time; nor does he simply play through
things. He interprets. (And such is his technical expertise that the SNO
give it straight back to him.) Elgar didn't just get played on Saturday
night; he got cosmetic surgery, his immense overture In the South being
thoroughly Wellered to the point that it came out like Richard Strauss.
Brilliant. Pass Weller the symphonies, somebody.
Berlioz didn't get done over in this way, but he was passed through
the Weller texture-mill, emerging, in the Roman Carnival Overture, with
some astonishing clarity. And in a spellbinding account of Les Nuits
d'ete, Weller floated the accompaniment as delicately and intimately as
chamber music, allowing mezzo Ann Murray to give a performance that was
as stress-free as it was ravishing. Gorgeous singing and playing.
Then all the stops out for Respighi's Pines of Rome, with Weller and
the band extracting every ounce of colour, juice, and (at the end)
volume from Respighi's palette. Stunningly atmospheric and vivid
playing.
* Concert sponsored by the Glasgow Friends of the RSNO.

THE case for the prosecution is strong. J B Priestley's domestic
thriller is arch, creaky, predictable, and terribly dated. The Perth
Theatre time machine returns us to a straight-backed world of
stiff-upper-lipped treachery, one in which, like an overly plotted game
of Cluedo, everyone has a motive and everyone is anxious to share the
guilt.
A year before the play begins, the enigmatic Martin has committed
suicide only days after being accused of the theft of #500. Twelve
months later, a chance conversation about a music box among a gathering
of family, colleagues, and lovers leads to the improbably delayed
uncovering of inconsistencies in the story of his suicide -- or was it
murder?
Steering the thing just inches away from a Harry Enfield parody,
Martin's brother Robert remains a good three pages behind the audience
throughout. The case for the defence is rather more subtle. Apart from
the fact that this kind of guessing game, however naff, is actually
quite pleasurable, and apart from the fact that the play is given a
brisk, well-modulated production by a strong Scottish cast, what is
really intriguing is the way Dangerous Corner deals with considerably
more powerful forces than its archaic form suggests.
The image we get of the unseen Martin as a charismatic, degenerate,
bisexual junkie, might be comically lurid, but he represents a wild
Dionysian spirit that constantly threatens to tear apart the Apollonian
order of the civilised society we see before us. Deep down it's a play
about truth, honesty, and hypocrisy, and even as we watch, the very
structure of the play in all its artifice seems to crumble. The result
is something simultaneously dreadful, fascinating, and curiously
entertaining.

THE play formerly known as A is for Abba very nearly didn't get its
premiere after the publishers of the music of the Swedish melodymeisters
were in touch to complain that Take Two Productions did not have
permission to use the group's name. A bit of an oversight by the company
and director Liz Carruthers that, especially as they had had to drop the
original title of Knowing Me, Knowing You -- now indelibly associated
with television's Alan Partridge.
The subtitle, now promoted, fairly accurately describes the intended
subject matter, even if it is more pompously described within the text
as ''a play about saving the past -- and saving yourself at the same
time''. Really it is just an excuse to ride the nostalgia wave with the
cast in hot pants and flares and the script peppered with references to
Charlie's Angels and punctuated by eight Abba songs, faithfully
reproduced by the central foursome of reunited school chums.
The most winning performance, however, was by the fifth member of the
cast, Julie Coombe, taking no fewer than 10 roles, including that of the
narrator. While Coombe coped well -- helped by having many of the
funnier lines, particuarly as a Malaproping nun -- her task rather
pointed up the structural flaws in Stuart Thomas's work, which tended to
draw attention to its homespun theatricality in an attempt to cover its
deficiences.
It is a much less involving piece than Clyde Unity's Bay City
Rollers-inspired Shang-a-lang, but it is only fair to report that my
misgivings were not shared by an audience who had come prepared to laugh
the recitation of a phone book as long as it contained the word
''arse''.

Dance
SUDDENLY, it's all over. The most exciting month of dance anywhere in
Britain -- probably in Europe. It ended on a pitch of excitement (Holy
Body Tattoo) and a shimmer of hauntingly poetic imagery (Le Carre des
Lombes) -- two of the Canadian companies that have proved the worth of
an increasingly productive relationship between that country and New
Moves.
Poetry and Apocalypse found choreographers-performers Noam Gagnon and
Dana Gingras (who are Holy Body Tattoo) locked in pulverising cycles of
slamming, crashing movement. Any effort to stand, to rise free of the
floor, resulted in yet another bruising fall. Live percussionists Craig
Riddock and Jean-Yves Theriault created a relentless barrage of often
brutal noise -- amplified drumbeats and the metallic clamouring of some
impromptu anvil. At times the sounds seemed to punch through the
dancers' bodies, causing them to jerk and thresh. Yet they kept going. A
performance full of fierce physicality and indomitable spirit, a dance
against giving in to the desolation of the times.
Du souffle de sa tourmente, j'ai vu led us into some other
non-specific place -- a hazy gathering point where five women caught
sight of themselves maybe as they were, maybe as they could have been .
. . a shift achieved by the occasional donning of nineteenth-century
costume over their cropped tops and trousers. In one way there was an
exploration of altering female image -- Daniele Desnoyers
(founder-choreographer of Carre des Lombes) gives her
technically-astounding dancers strong double work full of supporting
lifts -- but the piece has other resonances, such as aspects of
transience. Incredibly moving, superb in the range of images presented.

Clare Henry argues that
gallery goers
deserve to be
better informed
AT first sight Glasgow's Tramway looked half empty: a sea of grey
concrete floor and vast white walls scattered with left-over
industrial-looking objects. There's a dirty big steel drum; two groups
of massive rusty cannon balls tethered in nets: a pile of leaves, huge
black rubber mats, and long metal hanging rods. But this is no pile of
junk. On closer inspection the balls have names, the metal rods carry
chunks of coal, and the drum welcome mats. It is in fact a collection of
the new sculpture by top international artists from Italy, Spain, and
New York.
So what to make of it? How to get a handle on it? Where to start? How
will the puzzled public react to this weird avant-garde work plonked
before them with no explanation; no information? If visitors walk round
and out, who can blame them?
The show is called Young At Heart: Kounellis Penone Plensa Spitza. The
former tells you nothing; the latter could be the name of a place, a
sponsor, or a new drink. Once you've established that the exhibits come
from four different folk, not a single artist with four styles, the next
question is nationality and age. Are the artists dead, old or, as the
title wrongly implies, very young? (Kounellis is almost 60.) For despite
their calibre, they are not household. And, ultimately, what does the
sculpture mean -- or is it just abstract? Is it enough to experience its
shape and texture or should you be able to clock the symbolism, too.
By sheer coincidence the problems of ''audience development'' (ie how
to attract more folk to art exhibitions) was discussed as part of a
Scottish Arts Council seminar at Tramway the day the show opened. Having
identified the issue Andrew Nairne, SAC Art Director, asked a pertinent
question: are exhibitions so artist-centred that they preclude the
public?
Nairne offered statistics. ''Only 5.6% of the population go to
exhibitions more than three times a year.'' So what about the other
94.4%? Evidently the Scottish Office is worried, too. Public money --
around #1.9m -- is dispensed on visual art by the SAC alone. So could it
be that the 94.4% have been put off by unexplained exhibits -- like cast
iron balls or piles of leaves, mud, lard, metal, lost property, bottles,
crushed cars, cloth, rope -- or any of the other perplexing ''new''
materials used in late twentieth-century art?
A 1992 SAC report on audience attitude to contemporary art also found
that all visitors want more information and concluded that clearly there
is a big gulf between attenders and potential or non-attenders. But what
about the gulf between the artist's aim and the public's understanding
and interpretation of it? Many curators are so busy pursuing art world
careers, they forget about their audience. Some even eschew labels
because they mess up nice clear, white spaces, never mind ignoring the
benefits of introductory texts and documentation.
Yet the public have a right to explanations. This is not to patronise,
but mere polite commonsense. What with experts assuming the public have
an in-depth knowledge when they don't, and artists currently making very
intellectually complex works, how the heck do they expect audiences to
grow?
Basic explanation is the key. I have been hammering on about this for
years, and agree with Nairne that something must be done.
Audiences require the bare facts first. Analysis comes later. And it's
easy. Show a current photo of the artist so that people can place him
agewise. Folk are curious about how artists live; how they make things,
so a picture of them working in the studio is good. Quote the artist's
words. These are always preferable to long-winded, dry, theoretical
curatorial jargon. I for one would be interested to learn why Penone is
so fascinated by his own thumbnail (it appears once giant-sized in green
glass; 600 times small in white plaster); if Spitza's Romanian
upbringing influenced his use of linoleum and floor rubber; why
Kounellis likes coal. There is no hint of an answer on the single page
summary at Tramway.
Plensa first showed in the UK at the RSA during Edinburgh Festival
1992 where I found him an affable, helpful interviewee. ''Sculpture is
not a question of materials but a question of emotions,'' he said. As a
Catalan from Barcelona his use of net and mud in the ball piece, Twins,
may relate to fishing and the sea. However, the cannon balls are like
lottery balls, their nineteenth-century Christian names Louise, Peter,
Julia, Dean (Dean?), supposedly relating to prevalent Victorian slum
diseases like asthma, polio, emphysema, chickenpox, hepatitis. Who gets
what is just a game of chance -- or so Plensa seems to be saying.
These four installations at Tramway were made over the past six years
at the Henry Moore Sculpture Studio in a vast old mill at Dean Clough,
Halifax, where they were linked both to local industrial history and to
the site. Dean Clough is a unique organisation and its huge raw space
has had some spectacular shows. The Kounellis and Ruchreim (whose
permanent display at Clonegal, Ireland is breathtaking) were especially
memorable. One room there is dominated by pillars which Kounellis
surrounded by 14 giant iron discs, (foundry fees #20,000); the metal
rods hung in another. Separated from the discs and the site, the rods
are inevitably less impressive and more incomprehensible.
Serge Spitza's boring big, black rubber mat with its hidden photo
spools lies near his more interesting coiled three-metre high spiral
made of a single steel I-beam. His drum is about uselessness, in
contrast to the Tramway's I-beams which actually support the roof above.
Best to my mind is Penone's delicate leaf-strewn floor and white walls
where light and shadow play on tiny thumbnail casts placed delicately on
torn paper shelves.
This is the first time these sculptures have been seen outside
Halifax, and signals the start of a series of collaboration between
Tramway and Dean Clough which gives Glasgow a tremendous opportunity to
see high-calibre work by top internationalists. However, these shows
particularly need explanation. Dean Clough is a studio, not a gallery.
Visitors there are specialists; experts. Tramway is a public space
funded by the district council for all Glaswegians. As such it is
essential that its shows are made accessible to all-comers.

Ken Smith talks to Jessie Carnegie, 70 and still camapigning for
socialism and the Co-op movement
SHE left school at 14; fought her way up to become a school head
teacher; worked all her life for the Co-operative Movement and the
Labour Party; and was ultimately betrayed by a photocopy of her birth
certificate.
We could be talking a Barbara Taylor Bradford novel here of gritty
working-class girl who made good. The truth though, set in Glasgow,
involves someone far more interesting than some two-dimensional book
character.
Jessie Carnegie twice fought Tory seats in Scotland for the Labour
Party at a time when there was no question of seats being specifically
set aside for women. Both times she reduced the majorities without ever
actually making Westminster.
And in her personal life she decided that bringing up two children was
not enough. She studied for her Highers at night classes, went to
teacher training while her children were still at school, and eventually
became head teacher of Hill's Trust Primary in Govan.
She served on the Scottish executive of the Labour Party, chaired the
Scottish committee of the Co-operative Party, and for the past five
years was chair of the Co-operative Party nationally -- until her
downfall when someone brandished a photocopy of her birth certificate
showing that she was too old to hold office. So at the age of 70, Jessie
Carnegie's work for the Co-operative Party ended suddenly, and with just
a touch of bitterness. It seems that while racism and sexism have quite
rightly been banished, ageism can still be official policy.
But the ending should not detract from a lifetime's commitment to
socialism, from a woman who has always had to battle against male
dominance in the party and who sadly believes that women's rights have
not progressed enormously in the past 50 years, no matter the lip
service.
To many people today the Co-op is simply another supermarket, but
growing up in pre-war Glasgow, it was a large part of everyday life.
Everyone shopped at the Co-op, which was then a series of small, local
societies. To this day people will recite their family's Co-op number
where the dividend was saved up to pay for school shoes, a holiday at
the seaside, or a bottle of whisky and a bottle of sherry at Hogmanay.
It was not just shopping though. There was the Co-operative Women's
Guild which gave many working-class women their main source of
entertainment and an oportunity to leave the housework to meet friends.
The movement began with the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844 who wanted to
give working-class people wholesome food at reasonable prices without
having to buy at the mill-owner's own shop or whatever.
In 1917, just as the trade union movement saw the need for a voice in
Parliament, which led to the Labour Party, the Co-op Movement formed its
own political party -- the Co-operative Party, even though the term
''the political wing of the Co-op'' makes it sound like the Sinn Fein of
the soup mixes and Christmas cakes.
It is now affiliated to the Labour Party at a local level and sponsors
14 MPs, including six in Scotland -- George Foulkes, John McFall, Ian
Davidson, Gordon McMaster, Lewis Moonie, and Tommy McAvoy. It means they
are given a share of a researcher at Parliament and funds to help run
their constituency offices.
Jessie Carnegie's involvement began as a schoolgirl in the north-east
of Glasgow.
''My mother was a Co-operative Women's Guild member and she dragged me
along to meetings. When a woman joined the guild it was her one night
out of the week.
''By the time I was 14 my father, who was a member of the Communist
Party, insisted I left school, even though I was dux. He was a great
believer that no working-class child would be allowed to prosper in a
capitalist society so it was pointless for me to stay on at school,
according to him. He was a very dogmatic man.
''So I went to work in a pawn office. I couldn't say it was an
enjoyable experience,'' she recalled.
By then Jessie had joined the Co-operative Party, and 12 years later
the Labour Party. It was the Co-operative Party which sent her to a
training school at Stanford Hall for two weeks of intensive work, which
taught her public speaking and gave her the confidence to take a more
active role in politics.
Married with two young children, she also took the plunge to begin
studying again in her early thirties for her Highers, and then enrolled
for teacher training at Jordanhill.
Her interest in politics grew also, and she decided that she wanted to
stand for Parliament. ''There were so many injustices in the world and,
as the saying goes, without power we can do nothing, so Parliament
seemed the place to be. I also felt there was an under-representation of
women.''
In 1963 she attended her first selection conference to try to become
the Labour Party candidate in Perth. As Roseanna Cunningham of the SNP
found out recently, becoming a woman candidate in Perth can lead to some
bizarre questioning.
Said Jessie: ''I stood up and made my usual fighting speech, and then
the chairman asked if there were any questions. This man stood up and
said 'First of all, how many children do you have? What are you going to
do with them when you go to Parliament? And what does your husband think
about it?'
''James Jennings, who went on to become the convener of Strathclyde
region, got the nomination.''
She did win the Labour nomination in East Renfrewshire seven years
later, to stand against the well-known Tory, Bettie Harvie Anderson.
''That was a great campaign. We did dent her majority, but as they said
then, if you stuck a scarecrow in a field with a Tory rosette, they
would vote for it in East Renfrewshire. And Bettie Harvie Anderson was a
very formidable woman.''
Then in 1974 she took on populist Tory Teddy Taylor in Glasgow
Cathcart, and it was then a small piece of folly proved to be her
downfall 20 years later. ''There were not many women around then in
politics. I was one of the few. By the time I was making an impact I was
older, and at the time thought people took age into account too much. I
was 50, and took three years off my age when I was campaigning, and
never put them back. I timidly thought that 47 seemed better than 50.
''If I enjoyed East Renfrewshire, I enjoyed Cathcart twice as much.
There was so much support for Labour, particularly in Castlemilk, you
would have thought we couldn't lose. There was a huge Labour banner down
the side of a tower block.
''Teddy was shaken. His literature said Vote for Teddy, but never said
what party he was. I remember one old woman when we were out
campaigning. 'I always vote for Labour, hen. I always vote for Teddy,'
she said.
''We reduced his majority considerably, but he was saved by the SNP
vote holding up. It later collapsed, and John Maxton was elected for
Labour.''
After that, Jessie became a head teacher, and like many a daughter had
to look after her then ageing father. Dreams of Parliament eventually
faded.
She still kept campaigning for Labour. Still does, in fact, as she was
out on the doorsteps during the Monklands by-election. Her political
energies were directed more to the Co-operative Party, which apart from
sponsoring Labour MPs was a campaigning organisation on issues such as
health and food.
''You've no idea the number of Labour politicians who come to our
meetings, and they always start with 'I remember my mother's Co-op
number'. You sit there waiting for it, and you're thinking to yourself
'But what else have you done for the movement since then?','' she
astutely recalls.
She chaired its Scottish committee, and for the past five years was
chair of the party nationally. There was an old rule that said you had
to stand down at the age of 68. If anyone ever thought about age, and
most people did not as Jessie can easily be taken as someone 10 years
younger, they would at most think she was 67.
Next month her crowning glory would have been chairing its annual
conference when it came to Glasgow. But now she can't.
It is still painful. She tried to put it out her mind quickly. ''A
colleague, in inverted commas, photocopied my birth certificate, and
that was me. Since then the person who did it has also resigned, so I
don't know why he did it.''
So she was robbed of a fitting end to her active career in politics
which spanned nearly 50 years.
But she's still a fighter for what she believes in. Is it easier for
women now in the Labour Party? Jessie's not totally convinced. ''The men
will not come out with the questions I was asked at Perth, but many
might still be thinking it.
''It is easier for a man. He more or less knows his wife will look
after him and the children -- be a stalwart in the constituency and so
on.
''As long as we don't have proper childcare, it will be difficult.
That's why a Scottish Parliament has got to have proper nursery
provision and hours that are suitable for a decent family life for men
and women,'' she fired off enthusiastically.
Seventy? I really will have to see that birth certificate to believe
it.

Well, what did you give for Mother's Day?
WILLIAM RUSSELL looks at bygone gifts for those who had everything.THE
problem of what to give somebody who has everything has never worried
the Windsors. When anybody wanted to make them a present they simply
murmured the word -- Faberge. Nothing too expensive, of course. Queen
Alexandra, who collected the works of the Russian silversmith and
jeweller, made clear that something within the #15-#50 price range would
be acceptable, anything more costly might cause embarrassment or give
offence.
Although most people think eggs and Faberge are like peaches and
cream, the Royal Collection, on show in the Queen's Gallery at
Buckingham Palace until next January, contains only three examples of
his eggs. It is a glittering display of the sort of things which
enchanted the royal taste, some acquired as gifts, others purchased by
them from the shop in Bond Street or in salerooms.
In 1907 Edward VII ordered a series of animals modelled on the royal
pets at Sandringham House -- as well as farm animals ranging from shire
horses to heifers, hens, and turkeys, it included his Norfolk terrier,
Caesar. Made from chalcedony with cabochon ruby eyes, Caesar wears a
transluscent brown-enamelled gold collar inscribed with the words -- ''I
belong to the King.''
His race horse, Persimmon, winner of the 1896 Derby and St Leger, was
modelled in silver by Faberge and also features in a photograph
contained in a glittering Faberge frame.
The royals admired cigarette cases -- George VI in particular, and
some of his cases are on show. But the most interesting case is one
given to Edward VII by his close friend, Mrs George Keppel, also a keen
collector of Faberge. It is made of red gold, the surface is dark blue
enamel, and across it is a snake set with rose diamonds which has its
tail in its mouth. After the King's death in 1911 Queen Alexandria
returned it to Mrs Keppel with a stub of one of the King's cigars inside
as a memento of their friendship. In 1936 Mrs Keppel gave it to Queen
Mary so that the royal collection should be intact.
The 543 items range from flowers to animals of every sort, from mice
to a cigar lighter in the form of a frog. There are clocks, pen knives
and letter openers, scent bottles, presentation boxes, bell pushes, cuff
links, seals, picture frames, and magnifying glasses.
A considerable number of the items belonged to the Windsor's ill-fated
Romanoff cousins. They include a mosaic egg, an Easter gift in 1914 from
Nicholas II to Alexandra, and an amazing Colonnade Egg clock made of
gold, pink, and white enamel, which consists of a Temple of Love studded
with diamonds surmounted by a cupid symbolising the Tsarevitch, a gift
in 1910 by Nicholas to Alexandra.
* Faberge at the Queen's Gallery is open daily from 9.30 -- 16.30.
Admission #3.50.

As Bob Dylan begins his latest British tour, which will wend its way
into Edinburgh and Glasgow at the end of next week, critics are positing
his bankruptcy as a songwriter. David Belcher reports
IT'S a cruel-sounding theory, as well as being a sweeping one which
has been advanced a number of times before. None of these factors,
however, makes it any less valid. And the theory is: if Bob Dylan had
perished in the accident he sustained while riding his Triumph
motorcycle in Woodstock during the summer of 1966, his artistic
pre-eminence would have been assured.
History would have adjudged Bob Dylan the man who invested a cheap
popular music, rock'n'roll, with the greater currency of art. In
blurring the dividing line between high-falutin' poetry and low-brow
pop, he invented a new language capable of articulating a range of
subtle and complex emotions hitherto deemed inadmissible outwith the
cloisters of literary fiction: irony, prophecy, anger, anxiety, desire.
Listen to any of the albums he made in the five years from his
self-titled debut until Blonde On Blonde, released in 1966, and you'll
know.
As reinvented by Dylan, pop was empowered to transmit messages other
than hackneyed and one-dimensional lovey-dovey ones. It could issue
clarion protests and baleful reproaches. It had a meaning and an
importance of its own, whether political or social, cultural or
personal. Bob Dylan had freed popular music so that it could be literal
or it could be symbolic; provocative, cryptic, or surreal.
Unfortunately, in elevating rock to a topic worthy of intellectual
analysis, there was one unpleasant side-effect: Bob Dylan kick-started
rock criticism. Whether practised in the popular prints or by his
earnest legions of proprietorial nit-picking fans, it has dogged Dylan's
every step during the past 34 years. His every move has been denounced
and deified; dissected and discussed.
Of course, the process has provided what must have been pleasant
pluses, like Bob's French governmental elevation in 1990 to Commandeur
dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Being inducted into America's Rock
And Roll Hall of Fame. Being awarded a Grammy for Lifetime Achievement.
Yet the downsides are low. There was the fan who trawled through
Dylan's domestic dustbins on a daily basis throughout the seventies.
There was the Tasmanian schizophrenic who killed his mother to the
strains of Bob's One More Cup Of Coffee For The Road.
And now, as Bob begins his latest British tour, which will wend its
way into Edinburgh and Glasgow at the end of next week, newspaper
critics are positing his bankruptcy as a songwriter.
Indeed, in the half-decade since the release of Under A Red Sky in
1990 there have been nine ''new'' Bob Dylan albums -- comprised of Best
Of compilations, official bootlegs and solo acoustic performances of
traditional folk and blues standards -- with nary a single new Bob Dylan
song on any of them. His forthcoming Unplugged album continues the trend
of revision rather than creation, and not until 1996 is there any
prospect of new Bob Dylan material on record.
Ironically, the newest thing Bob Dylan has become involved in of late
is the transfer of some of his archives to the latest medium of
information technology, CD ROM.
Bob Dylan: Highway 61 Interactive is a CD ROM featuring 102 Dylan
photos; on-screen mock-ups of Greenwich Village in the sixties and the
studio where he recorded Like A Rolling Stone; video clips; the complete
flashcard sequence from the film which accompanied Subterranean Homesick
Blues; quotes from past Bob Dylan radio interviews; interviews with
real-life participants in Dylan's life-story; 10 songs in full; audio
clips of 42 others, plus the complete lyrics to all 550 of his songs on
his 41 albums.
Additionally, critics have wrung their hands in dismay over what they
perceive as Dylan's increasing corporatisation. Their argument is that
Dylan used to be the most free-wheeling of anti-Establishment
commentators ---- but now he and his team of advisers have sanctioned
the use of The Times They Are A-Changin' in an ad for accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
And while suit-wearing members of the Dylan camp might have felt OK
about suing the Apple computer corporation for using DYLAN as acronym
for their new Dynamic Language programming software, shouldn't Bob have
been reminding them of his gratitude that the executors of Dylan
Thomas's estate didn't take the same steps when one Robert Zimmerman set
out of Hibbing, Minnesota, with a freshly appropriated stage name? Other
people's expectations . . . they're a more crippling burden than your
own. Maybe that's why Dylan has been dashing them so often in the past
20-odd years. Deliberately.
Because he surely must have known what doggerel Wiggle Wiggle was when
he wrote it in 1990 on Under The Red Sky, mustn't he? ''Wiggle, wiggle,
wiggle like a gypsy queen/Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in
green/Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue/Wiggle; wiggle,
wiggle till the moon sees you.'' One in the eye for every pseud whoever
sought to adumbrate all the elusive allusions in All Along The
Watchtower.
Similarly, he can only have groaned his way though Froggy Went
A-Courtin' on Good As I Been To You in 1992 as part of a perverse plan
to undermine all the extravagant claims that have been made on his
behalf, all the likenings to Keats and Shelley . . . ah, the deadening
weight attendant upon being acclaimed the poetical spokesman for a
generation when most of the folk doing the acclaiming are evidently part
of a generation of intrusive, po-faced drones.
And Dylan's self-puncturing strategy would seem to be working. His
ouevre is apparently becoming less mulled over. At the last count, there
were 22 Dylan books in print in Britain, as opposed to 52 about the
Beatles. With 20 tomes, it's the Rolling Stones.
Moreover, the UK arm of Random House has no plans to repeat the US
publication of Drawn Blank, a new book of Dylan's drawings in pencil,
charcoal, and pen-and-ink.
Dylan gave a rare interview to Newsweek to promote the book. What did
he say? ''I'd rather live in the moment than some kind of nostalgia
trip, which I feel is a drug, a real drug that people are mainlining.
It's outrageous. People are mainlining nostalgia like it was morphine. I
don't want to be a drug dealer.''
He has always seemed to live out this philosophy best on stage.
Early reports from Dylan's recent shows in Prague tell of him spending
the first hour unexpectedly singing without his trademark guitar, and
then assaying strange outbreaks of shadow-boxing and kung-fu'ing at the
mikestand. As ever, his songs were turned inside out.
But there is one critic who can be trusted. In reviewing Dylan's
Wembley appearance in 1987 John Peel wrote: ''Being an enigma at 20 is
fun; being an enigma at 30 shows a lack of imagination, and being an
enigma at Dylan's age is just plain daft.''
Twenty-nine years after his British shows were infamously booed for
not being what his audiences expected, I think Bob Dylan now knows this.

BY this time next week Mr Major's cabinet colleagues hope to have
shored-up their leader's position and taken a step towards the instant
damage-limitation that they require. A serious argument is developing as
to how this might be done.
Much will depend on Major's speech to the annual meeting of the Tory
Central Council -- an important gathering of the party faithful -- in
Birmingham this weekend. But just as vital are the speeches and fringe
meetings of a series of cabinet ministers who must find a way urgently
to dig themselves and their Prime Minister out of the deepest of
political holes.
They are faced with this dilemma: the Labour leader, Tony Blair, has
taken his party so far to the right that his vision is more attractive
to the electorate in ''middle England'' than theirs. At the same time
they cannot move even further to the right themselves, otherwise they
will find themselves supporting hanging and flogging.
Nor will it be sufficient, on the eve of local elections in Scotland
next month and in England and Wales in May, to lambast Blair as a
charlatan and Labour as copycats. They have to acknowledge that Blair
has stolen most of Major's clothes and that their job is to rush forward
with new apparel for him.
Do they really want to do it? The smell of this cabinet is that they
don't dare to do otherwise, but they don't really have their heart in
it. Heseltine again pronounces undying support for Major, but the word
around ministerial circles is that he is plotting again. He collaborates
with the champion of the right, Michael Portillo, behind the scenes.
The latter can learn from the former's powers of oratory. They share
the same concept of creating jobs -- championing private enterprise to
take on the best in the world. People are beginning to think that the
two could work well together as leader and deputy. They have discovered
a personal rapport.
Perhaps it springs from a belief that if the Tories are to have a
chance at all at the next General Election, Major has to make his peace
with the Tory right. Mr Malcolm Rifkind appears to be aware of this and
is busy re-opening his lines to the likes of Portillo.
Other cabinet rightwingers, like John Redwood who has a keynote speech
to make in Birmingham, are trying to get Major to reassert Conservative
and British values and use our language and broadcasting expertise to
restore national self-confidence. This also means re-establishing in a
dramatic way the primacy of Parliament over European institutions.
The Prime Minister finds himself with nine of his back benchers off
the Tory whip, and a growingly disenchanted 12 Ulster Unionists.
Furthermore, reforms of Commons procedures and modes of working are
threatening to reduce the Chamber to a three-day week. This reflects,
rather than challenges, the working parliamentary systems of our
European partners.
Redwood, who likes to think of himself as the late Keith Joseph's
replacement as guru to the Tory party, would indeed be willing to do for
Major what Joseph did for Thatcher. But Redwood's supporters need to
know that his game plan would be taken up by Major and consistently
applied, through thick and thin.
This is something Major, unlike Thatcher, has not demonstrated as
being his chief talent. Indeed, his propensity to act on the last thing
that was said to him by the last person to advise him is what has got
him into his present predicament. This is that again there is talk of
him being challenged for the leadership this year in the wake of further
disastrous local election results.
Only the Heseltine supporters think Major should be challenged,
although the maverick rightwinger, John Carlisle -- who offered himself
as a stalking horse last year -- declares that ''one way or another the
air has to be cleared''.
Yesterday, Mr David Hunt, the Prime Minister's propaganda
co-ordinator, declared that a challenge will not come. Rifkind put it
slightly differently: ''It is always possible that you will get some
very foolish individual back bencher who will put himself up as what is
known nowadays as a stalking horse. But I don't think that is
significant.'' Heseltine again declares that Major will lead the Tories
into the next election and win.
Ho-hum. A Mori poll in the Sunday Times yesterday should jolt the Tory
parliamentary party into sensible thinking about this. It indicates that
even if Heseltine were to take over from Major, they would still lose
and lose heavily. The true reading of the party now is that the party in
the country and the electorate would not stand for another ''stunt''.
If Major is to be ditched, it should be by the voters.
Most of the MPs on the Tory benches are completely unknown to the
country at large and their demise would not be remarked, let alone
mourned. A few of them confess this. They are those who are busy trying
to get themselves into the public eye to attain some other form of
employment after electoral defeat.
They are even now conscious that many of them would not have got to
the Commons in the first place had it not been for Margaret Thatcher,
who they assisted in dumping. And they would not have retained their
seats in 1992 had it not been for John Major, who they now help to
de-stabilise.
In these circumstances, Major can only rely on his cabinet and his
junior ministers. If they cannot put their heart into supporting him --
and, what is more, their political skills (such as they are) -- he is
sunk and the Tories consigned to watching Blair exploit their hard-won
economic recovery.
The argument goes beyond mere tax cuts in the autumn Budget, which are
already being discounted following the latest excellent trade figures.
This weekend at Tory Central Council the cabinet speakers have to
display not only a will to win again, but also a collective design to
enable them to do so.
It is a tall order. But these are desperate days and the stunning
success of Blair's approach to the nation leaves the Tories with only
the option of on-going and deadly defeatism.

NOW let me get this straight. You get out of jail clad like an extra
in The Last Days of the Shah. You go to a mosque and give thanks in
prayer for your new life and opportunities. And then you sit down with
Don King -- a man who can surely afford a decent haircut rather than
continuing to stick his fingers in the wall socket -- and figure out
which fellow humble mortal you plan to pulverise next in exchange for a
few million dollars more.
Mikhail Abdul-Aziz, alias Mr Michael Tyson, is a new man with an old
mission. The boxer who once famously described his tactical ambition as
pushing opponents' nasal-bone structure into their brain tissue has been
converted to a number of new philosophies during his three-year prison
term it seems, but pacificism is clearly not one of them.
You might argue, as sports fans inevitably will, that knocking lumps
out of other men for money is what he does for a living. You might argue
that this particular sport, if that's what boxing is, needs Tyson's
awesome skills as an antidote to geriatric beefcake squaring up to panto
stars. Or you might wonder how easily that form of breadwinning sits
with allegiance to the prophet Muhammed.
But then it would appear that Abdul-Aziz's spiritual journey has not
been overtly troubled by logic. Following a somewhat eclectic reading
list during his incarceration, including Marx, the Koran, Voltaire, and
Mao Tse-tung, it would appear that he felt moved to have a likeness of
the latter tattooed on his right bicep. (A man renouncing the violence
of his earlier ways might have been rather better advised to immortalise
Jung Chang, her compulsive Wild Swans being a rather more accurate
account of the Chinese cultural revolution than the Great Leader's
Little Red Fibs.)
But maybe some gratitude for small post-penal mercies is in order,
given that an instinctive belligerency seems to have metamorphosed into
an inclination to use his head for something more constructive than
butting. And the jury should probably stay out on his apparent
transformation in any case until his probationary four years are up and
he has had an opportunity to prove that rape and general social pillage
activities he has no plans to repeat.
But it won't just be the victims of the old-style Tyson who wonder
this morning why such a man should be accorded instant hero status on
his return to the wage-earning world. Are we so short of major sporting
talents that we need constantly to lavish attention and sycophancy on
the people who tarnish their skills with loutish behaviour?
Setting aside the current cases of footballers and violence which are
still the subject of court proceedings, there seems a persistent
fascination with the bad and the ugly, the good guys attracting scant
attention by comparison. The outpouring of affectionate reminiscences
about Davie Cooper last week proved an exception to the general rule: a
talent so prodigious that it commanded admiration from the most grudging
of quarters. But his golden era was not the past decade, a spell in
which it has been the Gascoignes and the Maradonas and other assorted
enfants terrible whose antics have dominated soccer coverage.
Perhaps we have made them victims of their own success. Perhaps the
mix of any man as immature as Gascoigne with sudden wealth, fame, and
adulation is a recipe with disaster written on it in very large type.
Perhaps there are few personalities from any background with the inner
resources to handle that kind of pressure, though occasionally men like
Gary Lineker seem able to grow in personal stature at the same pace as
their celebrity.
Even so you wonder why the bad boys should apparently be accorded a
different code of conduct; why their partners shrug when they continue
to function as full-time bachelors after marriage; why they are given
special latitude to be rude or aggressive in public.
Yet when they do fall foul of the law it's arguable that the very
visibility which permitted smaller-scale infringements of the social
code counts against them when they commit a crime from the consequences
of which even the smartest lawyers can't save them. Some people argue
that Tyson got off ridiculously lightly for a rape charge; others assert
that men in his situation are always at risk of women bringing false
charges.
The continuing O J Simpson court opera brings all these arguments into
the sharpest of focus. Before this circus finally got under way, the
case gave rise to a variation on the old gag: ''Knock Knock.'' ''Who's
there?'' ''O J.'' ''O J who?'' ''You're on the jury.'' The point being
that by the time the football star was in the dock there would hardly be
an American outside of north Alaska who couldn't recite the most
intimate details of his life and his wife's murder.
So does that mean that nobody in O J's situation can expect justice?
Or conversely, should we believe the current accepted wisdom in some US
circles that a combination of his top-flight legal team and his own hero
status will protect him from conviction no matter how astutely the
evidence is assembled or how damning it appears?
It would make a tragic farce of justice in the US or the UK if any man
walked free because of his status, yet it would also mock the legal
system if men and women were dealt with more harshly because they had
been accorded unsolicited role-model status.

IKNOW it is a touch premature to be talking about a General Election
already but you can bet it will be a dirty affair when it comes. Clues
emerged last week suggesting the Conservatives will go back to basics,
if that is the phrase, with an anti-immigration programme spiced with
much Euro-bashing.
Our Government is not alone in its preoccupation with immigration.
Travelling around Europe you cannot help noticing the almost complete
absence of black faces in cities like Vienna or Helsinki. You don't find
many in Bonn or Berlin, either, and those that are there are usually
non-citizens.
Emerging from the Brussels metro you must pick your way over and
around the beggars, many of them Bosnians, who find that life huddled in
doorways or crouched on freezing pavements is preferable to the misery
of existence in Sarajevo.
Europe -- and this is a generalisation -- does not like this sort of
thing. Cute politicians know there is resentment about non-white
immigrants among a worryingly large section of many EU member state
electorates. There is kudos to be gained by kicking them out as, for
example, they are doing just now in France where, by the remarkable
coincidence, there is a presidential election going on.
In Paris the immigration authorities last week organised an
unprecedented joint charter flight with the Germans and Dutch and
bundled aboard 44 unfortunates from Zaire. Six had been expelled from
Germany, 25 from Netherlands and the rest from France. They were all
deemed to be illegal immigrants and sent packing to Kinshasa where they
will, of course, be persecuted, possibly killed.
There is a significance to this which goes beyond just rounding up a
few unfortunates in possible danger of their lives who might, in a more
enlightened climate, be deemed genuine asylum seekers. This crackdown
came just before the so-called Schengen Agreement became operative
yesterday. Schengen is the town in Luxembourg where Germany, France,
Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg itself got fed up waiting on the
rest of the EU to dismantle their internal borders. They decided to
press ahead and have since been joined by Spain and Portugal. Soon all
but the British, inevitably, will join in.
Our Government is in the huff and is supported, it seems, by Labour's
Jack Straw as he pathetically tries to be more right-wing on this issue
that Michael Howard. But then those who remember the East African
expulsions in the 1960s know Labour's race record is as bad as that of
the Tories.
After having recently introduced major legislation on immigration, our
Government is about to do so again, it seems. And again by coincidence
this news came on the very day the European Commission announced it was
at long last getting down to removing all EU internal borders, including
ours.
Predictably, the Europhobes are in full cry. Charles Wardle, a junior
minister, has already won the prize for the weirdest resignation of the
Major years by quitting because, he said, Britain would be flooded with
millions of illegal immigrants. (Do these guys never realise that an EU
with no internal borders is an invitation to our immigrants, illegal or
otherwise, to flee from soaking, freezing Bradford to the warmth of the
south of France or the sunny Greek islands?)
What we are witnessing here is the ugly birth pang of Fortress Europe.
This is a Europe in which ''flanking'' arrangements will mean much
tougher controls on those arriving at EU external borders while internal
passport controls are removed. In other words there will be tougher visa
restrictions on visitors, especially black visitors, while those already
inside the EU will be picked off whenever they are caught and crudely
bundled into an aircraft and sent home as happened last week. Genuine
refugees and asylum seekers will find it more difficult to convince
governments of their case.
More immediately the British Government's stand on this issue could
backfire. The next few days and weeks will tell us if the British (and
the Irish who are dragged unwillingly along with us on this issue) will
find travel more troublesome in the EU. For we are now a sort of
second-class EU citizen when we travel within the Schengen group of
countries. We must now, it seems, join a different channel at a port of
entry. We might even learn a little of what it is like to be black and,
therefore, suspect at immigration points.
I quite fancy the idea of watching British Tory and Labour MEPs being
messed about at Brussels Airport while their French or German colleagues
sweep through immigration unchecked. Serve them all right.
This story will run and run because there is not enough political will
among the big parties to do the sensible thing and get serious about
removing all internal EU borders forthwith. Britain only kicked up a
fuss in the first place about free movement within the EU because of the
threat of Irish terrorism and that has disappeared, for all time we
hope.
Resistance to EU progress as promised by Mr Major is humbug made worse
by Labour's shameless attempts to be tougher than the Westminster
Tories. There are plenty of Tories in the European Parliament who see no
real problems signing up for the commission's proposals. Labour appears
split as well.
Mrs Pauline Green, ever careful not to overstep the Blair line, is
committed to freedom of movement for all EU citizens. But increasingly
she is also talking of ''sensitive issues'' and a ''long wrangle'' over
the new rules. She should take comfort in the fact that the whole issue
of freedom of movement in the EU was Conservative-inspired. Was it not
Margaret Thatcher who signed the European single act which begat the
internal market which begat the need to pull down borders?
In other words this is not just another ''Brussels diktat''. This is
merely the commission doing the clerking for the nation states,
including ours, who set these events in train.

RICH RELATIONS -- THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION OF BRITAIN 1942-1945. By
David Reynolds. Harper Collins #25. IT was George Orwell who first
noticed the American presence as ''an occupation'' (in December 1943)
but he was not the first, nor the only one, to resent it. When, between
1942 and 1945, three million Americans and Canadians passed through this
country to combat Hitler, there were bound to be many complaints about
them.
''Over-paid, over-sexed, over-fed, and over here'' encapsulated much
popular feeling. Reynolds explains and addresses the issues raised by
such reactions, examining the experience and attitudes of both hosts and
guests.
An American presence in Britain was unavoidable once the Allies, soon
after Pearl Harbor, decided that Germany must be their priority target.
Hitting it was difficult: the first Americans were mainly airmen
stationed in East Anglia whence they were able to bomb occupied Europe.
A cross-Channel invasion was inevitable but the Americans (much as the
Germans had done in 1940) underestimated its difficulties and were
impatient as they began to accumulate GIs in England but found that the
British military planners kept frustrating their ambitions. The Dieppe
Raid of 1942 (for which the equally impatient Canadians paid dearly)
showed how justified British fears were.
The invasion of French North Africa later the same year siphoned off a
good clutch of the American forces in Britain, but the later build-up
for what became D-Day brought in hundreds of thousands more.
These young males (usually no more than 1% of US personnel were
females, according to Reynolds's findings) were concentrated in the
South and South-west of England whence they were eventually to be
shipped to France on the right flank of the Normandy beaches. Some were
located in Merseyside and Cheshire because of their initial landfall in
Liverpool but, though Glasgow also played that role, very few were
located in Scotland.
There was, for a time, a large enough contingent in Ulster to have the
Southern Irish Government worried about a possible Allied invasion,
though that Government was basically sympathetic to the British. (Irish
opinion was sometimes confused: ''Who are we neutral against?'' is one
of many shrewd anecdotes which Reynolds deploys.)
This regional concentration in what is a small country reinforced the
effects of the American presence, and the real wonder is that relations
between the cousins, as they seemed to many on both sides, remained as
good as they were, though lots of examples of tensions and
misunderstandings are recounted here.
The differences between the two were much greater than their common
language would have suggested -- and even the language was, as it
remains, subtly different. Neither side really knew much about the other
-- the British view of America was mainly derived from Hollywood; but
so, often, was that of the GIs: very distorted images in each case,
which prepared few for the realities imposed by direct contact.
Reynolds is good at establishing the differences between two sets of
perceptions and realities -- in contrasting the vast open spaces of the
US, then far more rural than now, with the heavily urbanised England.
A large proportion of the GIs came from the South, particularly that
was true of the Negro soldiers, then still far more likely to hail from
Dixie than the North or West. The Americans wasted much of their Negro
talent out of prejudice, and the Army was not the force for integration
it became after the war. Negroes were not, usually, employed in combat
roles, but in servicing -- providing much of the military's ''tail''
rather than ''teeth''.
In the early days, when the US Army was building up, this tail was
much larger than the teeth; even later the tail was still long, an index
of a rich country at war. Negroes were, therefore, a conspicuous part of
the American presence, and friction between them and other US personnel
was marked. The hosts were far more liberal in this area, and Reynolds
shows how wide the cultural gap was in this area.
He also notices that, although the GIs were indeed rich compared with
their hosts, they were themselves the children of the Depression. It was
the war itself which allowed the US economy to recover; and alone of the
combatants its economy actually grew steadily during the war years. That
ensured that the resources to keep American troops happy were available,
and as a matter of policy the US Army spent lavishly trying to keep up
morale by providing material (and monetary) welfare. This generosity was
as novel to its immediate recipients as it was to the British who also
benefited from it.
Reynolds examines the sexual evidence and how the two cultures dealt
with matters like VD (the approach was very different, with the
Americans being more liberal, though they were very much less so
concerning rape where capital punishment could be, and was several
times, invoked).
Illegitimate births increased strongly during the 1940s in England and
Wales and extramaritally conceived maternities increased quite markedly
in 1944 and 1945 when American numbers were at their peak before the
invasion of Normandy; but so, in 1946, did English wives, although the
US Army tried very hard to prevent such marriages during the war years.
The evidence is interesting but needs a wider net of explanation apart
from the US presence -- and this Reynolds provides. He has plenty of
sociological as well as historical perspectives and it is a tribute to
his perspicacity that much of what he says is common sense that has
never before been deployed systematically.
This is a book which should sell on both sides of the Atlantic. It
manages to mix analyses of all sorts of matters (for example the soldier
as citizen) with an easy, and sometimes chatty, style. It bridges two
distinct views of the one experience in a way reminiscent of the success
it celebrates.

Zakho, Sunday
THE United Nations today evacuated more than 1000 Turkish Kurd
refugees, most of them women and children, out of the line of fire as
Turkey pressed its anti-rebel drive in northern Iraq.
A motley convoy of 40 trucks and minibuses, protected by UN guards,
arrived at the Atrush refugee camp from the Iraqi border town of Zakho,
60 miles by road to the north.
''The operation went very smoothly. The only problems we had were
vehicles breaking down,'' a UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
spokesman in Geneva said.
''We are thrilled that they got there,'' spokesman Rupert Colville
said.
The refugees, many of whom said they had fled heavy-handed tactics by
Turkish security forces fighting Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels
last year, clutched possessions -- including chickens and sheep -- as
they headed off.
Refugee Leyla Eren said she fled into the predominantly Kurdish north
of Iraq after harassment by Turkish troops. She said she now feared the
same again.
''The UN is going to guard us. That's why we're going to the camp,''
she said. ''I think we'll have a better life there.''
Others said their villages were burned by troops after they refused to
join the state-backed Village Guard militias, deployed in Turkey against
the PKK, which has fought a 10-year insurgency in south-east Turkey.
Washington is to monitor the northern Iraq offensive for possible
human rights abuses by Turkey, which is often accused of mistreating its
Kurdish population.
Turkish forces, whose offensive aims to wipe out Kuridish guerrilla
bases in northern Iraq, received reinforcements by air from two border
points, a security source said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Murat Karayalcin said Turkey could not let
the PKK control northern Iraq, whatever international pressures Ankara
may face.
''Northern Iraq has been left to the PKK so much so that they have
even planted fields of opium poppy there,'' the Hurriyet daily quoted
him as saying.
The refugees evacuated to Atrush today are among about 13,000 who
streamed into Iraq last year, saying they fled fighting between the Army
and the PKK.
Ankara insists they were forced over the border by the PKK in order to
damage Turkey's image.
Almost 10,000 other Turkish Kurd refugees are camped at Atrush, which
is outside the zone Turkish authorities have declared as the limit of
their cross-border campaign.
Ankara has sought to ease international concern over its thrust.
''Everything that can be done will be done in order to save civilians
and civil organisations. Turkey always respects the laws,'' Prime
Minister Tansu Ciller said yesterday.
A military spokesman said troops had taken 25 rebel mountain bases
since the campaign began. Turkey said it had killed 168 PKK fighters and
lost 16 of its soldiers, while the PKK put its death toll at up to 13,
with 178 Turks killed.--Reuter.

MILLIONAIRE author Lord Archer launched a fierce attack on Turkey at
the weekend over its ''barbaric'' military assault on Kurdish rebels in
Iraq.
The former Tory party chairman, who launched a charity appeal for
Kurdish refugees after the Gulf War, said Turkey was acting without
authority.
And he warned the Government in Ankara that the operation, which has
seen 168 guerrilla fighters killed according to the Turks, could damage
Turkey's hopes of joining the European Union.
Lord Archer said: ''The Turkish Government had no authority to enter
the safe havens of Iraqi Kurdistan with 35,000 soldiers and should leave
immediately.
''While recognising the problem being faced with the PKK in Turkey,
that does not give them the right to kill innocent Kurds in their
pursuit of terrorists.
''Turkey's desire to become a member of the EU must have taken a step
backwards with this barbaric move and the heads of governments in Europe
should make their position abundantly clear.''

GLASGOW the city, as opposed to Glasgow the Scottish Rugby Union
district, may not have any clubs carrying the city banner in the first
division next season -- which in itself is a disgrace and a situation
which will have to be addressed in double-quick time -- but throughout
the month of April Glasgow District players will participate in a series
of matches which could have a far-reaching effect on the game worldwide.
SRU laws committee convener Alan Hosie, with the backing of director
of rugby Jim Telfer, has invited all Glasgow District clubs in the top
five divisions to participate in a number of midweek games with,
possibly, the old Glasgow Knockout Cup awaiting the winners.
The silverware, though, is but an adjunct to the true purpose of the
matches, which is to run the rule over a number of experimental law
changes designed to make the game more enjoyable for players and
spectators alike.
Hosie, an ex-international referee and a Scottish representative on
the International Board, is mindful of the fact that rugby union is now
in the entertainment business. With Murrayfield tickets now costing #22
and their Twickenham equivalent retailing at #33, the players, and in
the first instance the legislators, have a duty to put on a show.
All of the experimental law changes which Hosie wants to study in next
month's matches are intended to make the game more enjoyable for players
and more entertaining for onlookers.
Hosie reckons that the rolling maul is still the cancer which is
killing the game. His thoughts on the subject had been formed well
before last weekend's Grand Slam showdown at Twickenham when the maul --
as stodgy as suet pudding but much less appetising -- often seemed to be
England's only weapon.
''The maul law is being badly refereed. When a side move the ball to
the back of a maul with players in front of the ball-carrier, then they
are guilty of obstruction. If the ball-carrier rolls off a maul then, in
my book, the maul is no longer in operation and that player can be
tackled legally. For the good of the game we must return to a situation
where the laws, as they currently exist, are properly applied,'' he
declares.
The Glasgow games will also see the introduction of a seven-point
penalty award for persistent offside, for players who lie offside in a
tackle, and for foul play, as well as the introduction of a fair-catch,
or mark, anywhere on the park and not just within the home 22-metre
line, as is the case at present.
And neither is Hosie alone in his belief that, currently, the midfield
playmakers -- the entertainers -- are suffering because of the clutter
of bodies which often make the M8 at rush-hour look like a quiet country
lane.
''No player will be allowed to break off the scrummage until the ball
has gone. This means that back-row forwards will not be allowed to stand
off, as they often do just now in defensive situations.''
Finally, the experimental games will see the lineout side-step
outlawed. Hosie believes that the lineout shuffle is messy, untidy, and
time-wasting and he wants to see the metre-gap become the maximum space
allowed between the opposing forwards.
The likelihood is that the series of matches will be video-taped and
then studied by Murrayfield officialdom. ''If we consider the
experiments to have been a success then we will take our proposals to
the International Board. What we have to remember is that, whether we
like it or not, we are in the entertainment business now,'' says Hosie.

Melrose 26, Heriot's FP 28
WAS this the most important game in the club's history? Heriot's coach
John Foster had little doubt: ''That is something that has been
mentioned all week and I could not argue with the description.''
One could point, perhaps, to season 1978-79, when Heriot's became the
first Edinburgh club to win the first-division championship, but
avoiding relegation this time was worth more than that.
The dreaded drop would have cost the famous old club money and
players: Scottish rugby would have been deprived, at the highest level,
of a team which has always thrived on enterprise.
Peter Hewitt, 38 years old and retired more often than Sinatra, swore
this was his final curtain and reflected that they had done it their
way. ''You know, in the very first season of the leagues, we beat
Langholm 24-23 to stay up. It was just like that out there today.''
It was, too. Heriot's were in grave danger of going down the plug-hole
when behind 18-7 at half-time. Having fought back magnificently in what
was a superb match, they then almost contrived to throw it all away.
''Stay on-side,'' screamed their support in the closing minutes as
Melrose pounded at the door. The referee, Charlie Muir, having been
exhorted earlier to return to his native Langholm, was now pleaded with
to supply the last blast.
Afterwards, as relief swept through the Greenyards, and Melrose
themselves learned they were safe, the home side sportingly agreed the
better side had won.
A certain club captain, Mr Craig Chalmers -- having opted to miss this
one for the Hong Kong sevens -- must have been breathing a little
easier, too.
International lock Andy Macdonald, on the sidelines for most of the
season, made a triumphant return for Heriot's. The lineout possession
won by him was crucial and his bulk made considerable difference in the
scrums.
Big Andy has not given up ambitions to return to Scotland colours. ''I
am available to tour this summer and hope the selectors will call on
me.'' He could be on the trip to Zimbabwe.
Craig Humphreys, skipper Stuart Paul, Graham Dall, and Grant Simpson
were the other stand-outs in a battling Heriot's pack. Cammy Glasgow was
a try waiting to happen while Henry Murray continues to impress.
Melrose did not play all that badly. Graham Shiel had a fine match, so
did Bryan Redpath and Robbie Brown, but they missed Chalmers' command
and some of their kicking was woeful.
Gordon Lawrie made the kind of break centres dream of to set up the
first try. He gave to Glasgow, who routed the remains of the defence.
Hewitt's left peg swept over the conversion.
Melrose ran a penalty, Redpath was just checked, but Steve Scott was
not, and the home side had a try. Gary Parker added a penalty and Derek
Bain a dropped goal.
Just before the interval, Shiel put in a wicked kick to the corner.
From the lineout, Robbie Brown bounced over and Parker converted. The
Heriot contingent were attacking their nails.
Yet immediately following the break came the revival. After Melrose
had illegally prevented a pushover, Heriot's were given a penalty try
which Hewitt gleefully converted.
Just to show it was no fluke, Heriot's heaved them over again, this
time Alan Watt taking the touch and Hewitt converting.
Parker landed a penalty to tie up the scores but a great take by
Macdonald set up a try for Jock Bryce. Hewitt inevitably converted.
With six minutes left, Redpath grabbed a try after charging down
Campbell Aitken's kick. It was too far out for Parker to convert.
In the midst of the dressing-room celebrations, Scotland hooker Kenny
Milne limped by. ''They say your body is a temple,'' he observed. ''Mine
is a bit like Melrose Abbey!''

Currie 9, West of Scotland 3
IT WAS evident pretty early on that both teams deserved to be playing
second-division rugby next season. Admittedly it was easy to criticise
from the reasonable shelter of the stand when 30 players were being
subjected to horrendous conditions in a bitter wind and driving rain,
but neither side showed any spark of talent that warranted rugby at a
higher echelon.
Currie knew before this match that they were destined for a lower
grade of rugby, but West came into it with a thread of hope that they
would stay up. That spindly lifeline snapped early in the game when
Currie showed the determination more in keeping with a side harbouring a
desire of survival.
Perhaps West were too keyed up, for the tenseness showed in their
play. It appeared no-one was prepared to take any responsibility for
making decisions.
The result? Fifteen disorientated players looking for the right route
and not finding it.
It was hard to believe in the first 40 minutes that West's forwards
could be so outplayed in every department. They lost the first three
scrum put-ins against the head, hardly saw a ball at the lineout, where
Mark Blair almost singlehandedly destroyed them, and came off second
best in almost every ruck or maul.
Currie had Ally Donaldson, West did not have David Barrett. That had
much to do with it, although the West fly half, out of action with a
broken ankle, would have been struggling even at his fittest to do
anything with such fractured and infrequent ball.
Donald revelled in the service from his eager forwards and, into the
strong wind in the first half, tortured West full back Alan Williamson
with huge up-and-unders. Perhaps West's wingers should have taken a leaf
out of England's tactical book and moved in to give support when they
saw the bombs coming. Currie got several penalties arising from
situations when Williamson was isolated and trapped under the
bombardment. Donaldson accepted three and missed two.
West's stand-in kicker Chris Hart missed goal chances immediately
after Donaldson successes, except the third time, when he made it 9-3
just before the interval.
For almost 20 minutes after the restart the West line was pummelled as
Currie's forwards took it in turn, kamikaze style, to throw themselves
at the line. Full marks to West for refusing to concede a try.
Then, inexplicably, West threw off the shackles and for the last
quarter gave Currie much to think about as the forwards suddenly came
out tops in the mauls and second phases. John Lonergan led by example
and most of the pack followed suit.
Currie panicked occasionally as they realised that a West goal would
win the game. Defending their lead was not a good tactic, but
fortunately for them the West mishandling at the most crucial of times
let them down and the score remained unchanged.
West coach Colin Mair's face showed the disappointment of being
relegated but he was philosophical in saying: ''It's ironic that we have
had one of our best seasons for years in attaining 10 points yet we are
going down because of the league restructuring.''
Currie's coach of only a few weeks, Brian Macnaughton, looked as
though his side had just won promotion: ''That was an important victory
for us. It is only the second of the season but it showed the attitude
of the lads. They were not prepared to lie down to anyone. I think West
were a bit surprised at our determination and will to win so late in the
season. The players understand my way of thinking. No game is over until
the final whistle. That attitude will stand us in good stead next
season.''
Currie -- D Wilson; C Robertson, M Plumb, W Weatherhead, G Keen; A
Donaldson, R Dickson; P Calder, G Ellis, C Boyd, G Hamilton, C Carson, B
Ward, M Blair, S Hardie.
West of Scotland -- A Williamson; M Craig, K Siems, C Hart, A Hogarth;
I Fletcher, F Stott; P Wong, G Bulloch, S Crerar, S Campbell, G Perret,
D McVey, J Lonergan, J Shaw.
Referee -- J Fleming (Boroughmuir).

Hawick 11, Gala 9
THE Old Firm is still in business. Trade may have been slack of late,
and on Saturday those old rivals Hawick and Gala served up a shop-soiled
miscellany of error-strewn rugby but, by no-side, there were no
money-back demands from Mansfield Park's largest crowd of the season.
Survival was the name of the game and now both Border clubs will grace
the new eight-team first division with their presence. That such an
outcome was ever in doubt speaks volumes for the manner in which the
power base of Scottish rugby has moved away from the Borders.
Hawick were totally dominant up front. The Gala pack eased back into
the game in the latter stages but it was interesting to conjecture on
the likely outcome if the Gala backs had been playing behind the home
forwards.
Derek Turnbull has been the cornerstone of the Hawick pack for longer
than he would care to remember. On Saturday, just as he did against
Boroughmuir a fortnight ago, the old warhorse was at the heart of the
pillage and spoil which proved so invaluable to the Hawick effort.
Turnbull overcame an early blow to the face which necessitated
constant running repairs to a bloody nose but, aided and abetted in
particular by Keith Scott, Jim Hay, Brian Renwick, and the
ever-improving Ian Elliot, the flanker was a real thorn in the side of
the Netherdale pack.
Gala were 9-3 up at the interval but Gregor Townsend and Co existed on
scraps. For much of the time their midfield defence was put under
extreme pressure and it was to their credit that, thanks to some
fearless tackling, the final deficit was kept to two points.
So much was at stake that both sides were edgy throughout. The game
was never going to be a feast of running rugby for the neutral spectator
and, at the end, as results from other grounds -- with GHK and Melrose
defeated -- began to trickle in to Mansfield Park, Hawick's immensely
relieved backs' coach Jim Renwick observed: ''Tae think oo went through
a' that for b. . . . . all.''
Gala coach Peter Dods said: ''You can't play the game without
possession and we didn't have any. Hawick had done their homework,
though, and we existed on short rations throughout.
''Both clubs have survived and we're both in the top division next
year. Neither of us, though, will be able to rest on our laurels.''
In which regard Dods, Scotland's 1984 Grand Slam full back, is
sceptical about the need for change at all. ''Within the last 11 years
Scotland have won two Grand Slams and contested a third. That doesn't
sound to me like a game in crisis. There has been a lot of pressure on
clubs this season and there will be even more next. I'm not sure that we
needed this league reconstruction at all.''
Hawick served notice that they were fired up for the game when, in the
very first scrummage, the hammer came down with a vengeance and the Gala
pack retreated at a rate of knots. Nevertheless, and against the run of
play, it was Gala who took the lead with a Mike Dods penalty goal after
13 minutes.
The same player had missed with a second penalty attempt and Hawick's
Scott Welsh had skewed a drop-goal attempt and a penalty shot before
Gala went further ahead through a second successful penalty by Dods
after 28 minutes.
Four minutes from the interval Hawick opened their account with a
Welsh penalty, Hawick having stolen Gala lineout ball and forced a ruck
in front of the posts. Dods, though, provided a six-point cushion for
Gala at the interval with his third penalty goal on the stroke of
half-time.
In the second period, and with the fierce breeze at their backs,
Hawick began with a vengeance. A series of rucks took the Greens to
within inches of the Gala line. Cameron Murray was bundled into touch at
the corner flag and in a five-minute period, Reid, Welsh, Renwick, and
Grant each made unsuccessful attempts to breach the stout Gala defence.
On the hour mark Gregor Townsend went off injured. He was tackled
running from the deep and received a sharp blow to the left knee. The
immediate diagnosis was indeterminate damage to the cruciate ligament
and the Scotland selectors, with World Cup selection on the horizon,
will be monitoring his progress closely.
Five minutes later Hawick clawed back to 6-9 with a second Welsh
penalty goal but, despite intense pressure, it was not until the
seventy-fourth minute that they put themselves in front when Cameron
Murray, in a flurry of arms and legs, forced his way over for a try at
the same corner flag where he had been earlier denied.
Gala were sure that he had been in touch but referee Bobby Clark --
who was officiating in his final game -- was on the spot to declare that
the try was good. Welsh failed with the conversion effort but Hawick had
done enough to ensure that they will feast at the top table next season
and not even Gala would begrudge them that.

THE latest crisis is the first major test of British
Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith as the UN commander.
''The honeymoon is over and Smith is going to have to step up to the
line and make some decisions,'' said a UN official in Sarajevo who asked
not to be named.
''He's a thorough, deliberate man who likes to weigh his options
before acting. The ceasefire gave him some time to get oriented. Now
he's being tested, especially by the Bosnian Serbs. They want to see
what he's made of.''
The UN commander led an armoured division in the Gulf War with
distinction, but he is no longer a war-fighting general.
Instead, Smith is being paid to keep the lid on the Bosnian war and to
protect UN peacekeepers while diplomats craft a negotiated settlement to
the conflict.
''Smith is facing the same old problem -- confront the Serbs with
force and you are playing a very high-stakes game,'' said a diplomat in
Sarajevo who asked not to be named.
''If they back down, you win big. If the Serbs strike back by shooting
a dozen peacekeepers or taking them hostage the mission could be over.
Rupert Smith doesn't want to preside over the withdrawal of a defeated
UN force.''--Reuter

Sarajevo, Sunday
BOSNIAN government forces have regained the initiative on the
battlefield in the last week, capturing ground from their Bosnian Serb
foes in fierce fighting, United Nations officials said.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic ordered the mobilisation of the
entire population of Serb-held Bosnia to counter a Bosnian government
offensive, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said today.
A similar Serb mobilisation order was issued after government troops
made substantial gains around the northwestern enclave of Bihac in
October which they subsequently lost in a Serb counter-attack.
Combat slowed today, a day of traditionally low military activity, UN
officers reported but they said it was too early to tell if the
government offensive had halted.
Muslim soldiers launched fierce assaults on key Serb positions in the
north and centre of the country last Monday, defying wintry conditions
to storm hilltop bunkers guarding communications facilities.
The offensive tore apart a four-month truce due to expire on April 30
that had brought relative calm to most of the country.
Peacekeepers said on Saturday that despite being kept far from the
combat by both sides they believed government troops had seized
communications towers in the northeastern Majevica hills and on Mount
Vlasic in central Bosnia.
UN officials say the government Army's infantry strength -- its
military trump card -- has been hit heavily by the might of Serb
artillery in the Majevica region assault.
Senior UN officers fear the Bosnian Army will continue its attacks and
return the country to full-scale war which they warn could force
peacekeepers to leave.
In another blow to UN hopes that the fighting would remain localised
and then die out, Bosnian Serbs unleashed a series of brief but
co-ordinated artillery attacks against Muslim-held enclaves and towns on
Saturday.
At least seven civilians were seriously injured in an 11-minute Serb
bombardment of the Muslim enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. Serb
artillery also hit Muslim-held east Mostar, inflicting seven more
casualties.
The Bosnian Serbs have vowed to counterattack to destroy the Bosnian
government Army but the battle readiness of their forces, cut off from
supplies by Serbia and reportedly weary of war, is unknown.
Officials from the Contact Group countries, Britain, France, Germany,
Russia and the United States, are to meet in London tomorrow to consider
new peace proposals from Moscow.
Russia wants to lift sanctions on rump Yugoslavia in exchange for
Belgrade recognising the independence of its neighbours Croatia and
Bosnia.
The Western states fear lifting sanctions too quickly will remove the
only incentive there is for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to
pressure the Bosnian Serbs into striking a peace deal.
Sceptical diplomats add that the issue of sanctions and mutual
recognition has little bearing on who controls territory in reality.

PARIS, Sunday
BURUNDI'S president, giving the first official tally of deaths in
Friday's ethnic clashes in Burundi's capital, said today that at least
150 people had been killed.
''There have been around 150 killings at least,'' President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya told Radio France Info in a telephone interview from
Burundi.
The figure was much lower than the 500 deaths, predominantly of
members of the Hutu tribe, reported on the basis of eyewitnesses'
accounts after last Friday's night of rampage in Bujumbura by Tutsi
militiamen.
Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, blamed young Tutsis for what he called ''acts
of ethnic purification, of Balkanisation'' -- a reference to alleged
killings of Moslems by Serbs in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia.
He said some 50,000 refugees were fleeing the city of 300,000 and the
suburbs of Bwiza and Buyenzi, where the clashes occurred, were virtually
empty although gunfire which echoed through the city for the past few
days had stopped.
''The population is feeling helpless. When you see the way violence
and massacres tend to spread, the population can only be worried,'' he
said.
He called on security forces and politicians to work to restore calm.
Burundi has been on the brink of all-out ethnic war since its first
democratically-elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, was assassinated in
1993. Human rights workers fear violence of the magnitude of Rwanda's
massacres

Tunis, Sunday
AN Algerian newspaper under state control said today troops had killed
at least 600 Muslim rebels in an ambush and subsequent week-long battle
outside Algiers and are still hunting down survivors.
Le Soir d'Algerie said troops ambushed about 900 Muslim guerrillas
apparently converging to attend a congress of the feared Armed Islamic
Group (GIA). The paper said Islamist leaders were among those who had
died.
There was no independent confirmation of the report, which comes
shortly before authorities are due to resume talks with political
figures about elections later this year.
''Besides 600 terrorists killed, it seems that the number of those who
still encircled (by Army troops) is estimated at more than 300'', Le
Soir d'Algerie said in its evening edition.
Other newspapers earlier said troops, personally led by General Said
Bey, commander of the region around the capital Algiers, killed more
than 300 Muslim rebels after ambushing them on a tip-off from a
repentant fundamentalist.
Algeria's military-backed authorities rigorously control what security
issues can be carried by the nation's media and neither newspaper
mentioned Army casualties in the battle against well-armed militants.
The ambush was the biggest confrontation reported since fighting broke
out in 1992. Up to 40,000 people have now died in the conflict.
El Watan said the ambush and mopping up of survivors started on March
18 and lasted into the weekend near the Ouarsenis mountains in North
Africa's Atlas range.
The newspapers said the GIA, the most ruthless of the militant groups,
was planning a conference in the mountains, about 70 miles south-west of
the capital Algiers.
Elite troops, backed by heavy weaponry and helicopters, mounted the
ambush in the rugged, forested Ain Defla region.
Commentators said the high publicity given to the incident could be
designed to send a message to Algeria's non-militant opposition that the
Government was gaining control of the security situation

the riot with tear gas and water cannons.
The network said two inmates armed with automatic weapons were firing

Cleveland, Sunday
FORMER heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, newly coverted to Islam,
enjoyed his first weekend of freedom at his luxurious rural Ohio estate
since he was sentenced to prison three years ago for rape.
Tyson's former status however won't be forgotten as he meets his
parole officer near Youngstown, Ohio this week, close to the mansion
Tyson went home to after his release on Saturday.
Tyson, 28, earned $40m before his arrest, according to the New York
Times. Now he must devote a portion of his four years' probation to
community service, and any criminal mistake would put him back in prison
for three years.
The victim, Desiree Washington, an 18-year-old beauty contestant at
the time of the rape, was highly visible during the rape trial three
years ago. However, this weekend she avoided reporters seeking reaction
to Tyson's release.
''She really wants to get her life together and be left alone,''
Michael Weisman, her lawyer, told the Boston Globe.

Guatemala City, Sunday
Four people died and dozens were seriously injured today when a
Guatemalan Army munitions warehouse exploded at the capital's main
airport, officials and local radio reports said.
Two firemen and an Army official died from severe burns after the
explosion of hundreds of grenades, mines, dynamite and bullets caused a
huge fire in army installations at the airport, Radio Sonora said. The
radio added that dozens were injured by the explosions.
The international airport was closed and all flights to Guatemala City
suspended because of the fire, an airport official said by telephone
from a control tower at the airport.
''There are constant explosions, all I can see is smoke and fire,''
Tonito Perez said. He said the force of the explosions blew out most
windows in the international airport.
According to Army official Cesar Monterrosa the fire was sparked by an
explosion in a oil deposit close to the munitions warehouse.

St John's, Sunday
SPANISH trawlers ceased fishing in disputed north Atlantic waters off
the coast of Newfoundland today after Canadian fisheries officials took
action against one of the vessels.
''Our goal today was to make them stop fishing and that is the case,''
a spokeswoman for Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said.
Fisheries officials confirmed they had acted to halt the Spanish fleet
trawling for turbot, or Greenland halibut, on the Grand Banks in
international waters just outside Canada's 200 nautical mile limit but
declined to elaborate.
However, Greenpeace Canada observers, monitoring Spanish radio
frequencies, said four Canadian patrol boats converged on a Spanish
trawler with the intention of boarding, causing the fishing to stop.
Tobin is expected to give details about the action, the latest salvo
in Canada's acrimonious dispute with overfishing of turbot, before
leaving for New York, where a United Nations conference on straddling
fish stocks begins tomorrow.
Straddling involves schools of fish on either side of international
boundaries.
Greenpeace Canada said the Canadian Coast Guard had threatened to
board one of the 18 trawlers in the area known as the nose of the Grand
Banks.
''The Canadian Coast Guard gave the order to one of the trawlers to
halt and prepare to be boarded by fisheries officers,'' Catherine
Stewart of Greenpeace said.
She said four Canadian patrol vessels converged on the Spanish vessel,
the Verdel, but it refused to be boarded, saying it was in international
waters and was not illegally fishing.
Canadian fisheries vessels have been patrolling the Grand Banks to
monitor Spanish vessels which resumed turbot fishing in defiance of a
60-day moratorium imposed by Ottawa.
Stewart said the Spanish patrol vessel the Viga had called on all
Spanish trawlers in the area to meet at a point about 20 nautical miles
outside Canada's jurisdiction.
The action follows the arrest on March 9 of a Spanish factory trawler,
the Estai, in international waters, which sparked a diplomatic stand-off
with the European Union. The boat was later released after payment of a
US$340,000 bond last week, returning to a hero's welcome in the Spanish
port of Vigo on Thursday. The captain is due to appear in a Newfoundland
court on April 20 on four charges of illegal fishing.
Tobin said yesterday that Canada sent out two patrol boats equipped
with warp cutters -- used to cut cables that connect fishing nets to
trawlers -- as three days of high-level talks between Ottawa and the
European Union in Vancouver ended without any resolution on the dispute.
Canada has accused European fleets, mainly Spanish vessels, of
overfishing for turbot and is pushing for tougher conservation measures
after the closure of the cod fishery in 1992 threw tens of thousands of
Atlantic coast fisherman out of work.
Europe has accused Ottawa of piracy and wants a greater share of the
international 27,000-metric-ton turbot quota.
Discussions were to continue in Brussels between expert groups looking
at better enforcement measures, a Canadian foreign affairs spokeswoman
said. Tobin is expected to call for a binding world agreement to protect
fish stocks at the UN conference.--Reuter

IT has all the hallmarks of a thriller. The victim: the
larger-than-life, globetrotting hero of a national movement. The
setting: the rugged, misty arena of a mighty Highland glen. The event:
death by gunshot. A shot fired at night, in the dark, miles from
habitation: the drama unseen, unknown, and unexplained. That's the
drama. The reality is the old, old tale of human blunder and carnal
pride.
Ten years ago Willie McRae, prominent Glasgow lawyer and a senior
Scottish Nationalist, was found dying in his crashed Volvo by the lonely
A87, on a Saturday morning early in April. It seemed, at the time, a
straightforward road accident. The Monday papers printed respectful
obituaries to a well-kent figure, once prominent in the SNP, once -- in
October 1974 -- short by merely 663 votes of replacing Hamish Gray as MP
for Ross and Cromarty.
It was some time before the media learned that McRae had, in fact,
been shot. And it was even longer before many began to query the
prevailing line of officialdom: that McRae, driven by unknown demons,
had taken his own life.
Ten years later the mystery boils on. There have been articles and
investigations, a TV documentary; two books feature analyses of the
mystery. The luckless McRae has been linked, at various times, with
Mossad, with Asian extremists, with the ''Scottish National Liberation
Army''; he has been accused, safely silent in his grave -- without widow
or children to defend him -- of mental instability, alcoholism,
homosexuality, malfeasance and megalomania; his demise, variously, has
been attributed to agents of MI5, Strathclyde Police Special Branch, the
British nuclear industry, and a drug cartel running dope through the
West Highlands.
Do the facts favour conspiracy?
The facts include a succession of fantastic blunders in the spring of
1985 -- born in the confusion of the day, fuelled by political
self-interest in the weeks that followed, now sustained by the massive
weight of bureaucracy in a state reluctant to admit secrets or error,
which may be covering up a murder.
Having viewed exclusive evidence, I can now assert:
* At least six hours passed after the discovery of McRae before anyone
realised he had been shot.
* By that time, a Northern Constabulary officer had failed to prevent
massive interference with the scene.
* That officer was NOT the local constable, and, remarkably, several
local officers were -- on this weekend -- absent or off duty.
* Raigmore Hospital, where McRae was first admitted, did not test his
blood for alcohol or drugs.
* The Northern Constabulary had removed McRae's car before the gun was
found.
* There is no proof -- of any kind -- that the gun was found in
proximity to McRae or to his car.
* The policeman who found the gun is adamant that it was well away
from the car.
* The gun yielded no fingerprints whatever.
* There is no proof that McRae ever owned it.
* The one witness who assured the authorities he did own it has
completely disappeared.
* The forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on Willie McRae
did not conduct elementary tests that could have proved either suicide
or homicide.
* Senior sources who insist he was never under ''secret state''
surveillance admit that the possibility of homicide cannot be
eliminated.
There is little doubt in my mind: Willie McRae was murdered.
* * *
McRAE was born in 1923 in Carron, by Falkirk. His father was an
electrician, of Kintail extraction, where the family had many relatives.
It was not a background of privilege, but it had all the romance of the
lad o' pairts. McRae excelled in school. He left Glasgow University with
a first in history, simultaneously editing a local paper in Grangemouth.
Commissioned in the Seaforth Highlanders, he transferred to the Royal
Indian Navy. To the end of his life he had close contacts with the
subcontinent; he made no secret of his sympathy with Indian aspirations
to self-government.
After the war McRae returned to Glasgow and graduated anew in law. He
was already active in the SNP. He has been linked to the famous Stone of
Destiny romp in 1950. Less believably, he has been credited with
assistance in drafting much of Israel's constitution. (This sort of lore
follows McRae everywhere: he is supposed to have been able to recite Tam
O'Shanter at the age of six; won untold academic prizes; been fluent in
Urdu, Hindi and other tongues; left the RIN as a commander; been on
personal terms with David Ben Gurion, Indira Gandhi, etc etc . . . Much
of this may be true.)
He was ''something of a bulldog to look at''; slicked hair, determined
jaw, a penchant for three-piece suits, a stolid, pugnacious presence.
McRae smoked, or rather ate, 80 or more Gold Flake cigarettes a day,
untipped, specially imported from Dublin. McRae ''could take a good
dram'', but intimates are adamant they never saw him the worse for wear.
''He hated being fuzzy-minded,'' insists Michael Strathern, who knew him
well.
Three things are certainly true. McRae, a gifted orator, and
enthralling company, was adored by his friends. McRae was a committed,
and for a time very senior, Scottish Nationalist -- though, by 1985,
less prominent. And he was a successful lawyer. Willie McRae was still
happy to lend his energies to good causes. In the seventies he
represented inshore fishermen against the creation of a torpedo-range
off Wester Ross. In 1980 he was prominent in the public inquiry at
Mullwharcher, Ayrshire, against UKAEA proposals for the dumping of
nuclear waste.
McRae has been credited, single-handedly, with saving a local planning
decision and denying the UKAEA permission. This was certainly a serious
setback for the nuclear industry, which has still no long-term strategy
for storing its toxins. ''Nuclear waste,'' he declaimed, in a line that
brought the house down, ''should be stored where Guy Fawkes put his
gunpowder.'' The press lapped it up. McRae became an increasingly vocal
critic of the British nuclear lobby.
He seems to have had a hand in organising the ''Oystercatcher''
operation to frustrate illicit test-boring in Glen Etive. It is
unlikely, however, that he was linked to the cod-Provos of the SNLA,
though he seems to have approved of the comic-opera Siol nan Gaidheal --
even claimed to be a member. Certainly, as a lawyer, he acted for SNG
members arrested during various japes. His heart, it appears, was set on
playing in another public inquiry into the fast-reactor proposals for a
''European Demonstration Reprocessing Plant'' at Dounreay. McRae, it has
been asserted, was writing a tell-all book on the nuclear industry.
Others claim that he hinted darkly of secret knowledge, that he had
classified papers.
Can any of this be proved?
Willie McRae was brilliant, passionate, larger than life. He would
have revelled in a new battle. But the EDRP inquiry was scheduled at
Thurso for April 7, 1986. When that day came, he had been dead for
precisely a year.
* * *
THE A87 road, from Invergarry to its junction with the Kyle of
Lochalsh-Invermoriston carriageway, has been colourfully described as
''perilous, narrow . . . a road on which the most reckless of drivers
would go slowly for fear of meeting another vehicle coming the other
way''. In fact, the A87 is a new double-track highway, with mild and
sensible bends, and is perfectly safe.
Here, well off the road, about 10am on the morning of Saturday, April
6, 1985, McRae's car was found by an Australian tourist. Inside,
comatose and with bloodied head, was Willie McRae. It was -- one of many
bizarre coincidences to dot this case -- the anniversary of the
Declaration of Arbroath. It was the first known sighting of McRae since
he left Glasgow the night before.
On the night of Thursday, April 4, McRae returned to his top-floor
Glasgow flat -- 6 Balvicar Drive -- after a ceilidh with his godson,
Howard Singerman. Early next morning, two passers-by saw flames from his
window; one raised the alarm, and the other dashed upstairs and broke
in. He found McRae lying unconscious on the hall floor. The fire brigade
arrived and doused a fire in the bathroom.
McRae, though shocked and sooty, recovered fast and declined medical
attention. His explanation for the fire seems weak. He claimed to have
fallen asleep while smoking in bed, and awoke to find clothes
smouldering. In panic, he had bundled them up and dashed out to dump the
blankets in his new acrylic bath. He (presumably) turned the taps on;
nevertheless, the bath caught fire.
McRae was highly embarrassed by the episode and remained in the flat
throughout Friday. His business partner Ronnie Welsh visited him. McRae
managed a joke. Later, a kindly neighbour brought him some soup. He
refused the use of their bathroom. He knew where he could get cleaned
up, he said. He was heading for a quiet weekend at his cottage, Camusty,
by Dornie, some eight miles east of Kyle.
The episode is significant: first, because a fire in these
circumstances is notoriously associated with drunken stupor, and --
secondly -- because Ronnie Welsh, whose role in McRae's death is
significant and strange, has since vanished. At 6.30pm, on Friday 5th,
another neighbour arrived in Balvicar Drive as McRae pulled away. And so
the maroon Volvo 244 -- FGB 214X -- and its ebullient owner began the
journey they would never complete.
McRae used Camusty often. He knew the road well. We know that at some
point McRae's car developed a puncture. When the wreck was later
examined, a ''clean'' spare wheel was on the rear axle; the punctured
original was on the back seat. Scott and McLeay's account of McRae's
death is the best available (Britain's Secret War, Mainstream, 1990);
they typically speculate that McRae stopped to change the wheel after
Invergarry. By then it would be about 9.30pm, and quite dark.
Alan Crowe was an Australian airline pilot. His present whereabouts
are unknown. On Saturday 6th he and his wife, holidaying in the
Highlands, noticed a maroon Volvo lying on the moor some distance short
of the road's junction with the A887. As couples do, the Crowes
continued driving north for some time arguing over what they had seen
and what they should do. They agreed to turn back and stopped in the
lay-by.
The car, a long beast, was ''straddling a burn'', some ''100 yards
beneath the road''. Even more oddly, it was pointing south, back towards
Invergarry. The Crowes could make out a slumped body, but it is not
clear if they left the road to look.
Certainly they flagged down the next car to pass. There occurred the
next -- and double -- coincidence. The driver was a doctor, Dr Dorothy
Messer (now Dr Dorothy Lochhead), travelling with her fiance, George
Lochhead; and one of her passengers was an SNP councillor from Dundee,
David Coutts -- who was heading north with his wife Alison, and who knew
McRae.
Together they bounded down the hillside. Coutts saw an SNP car-sticker
and exclaimed; seconds later he saw McRae's face, and had the shock of
his life. McRae's hands were ''folded on his lap''; his head was
''slumped on his right shoulder'', and there was a ''considerable amount
of blood on his temple''. McRae was not wearing his seat belt.
Our farce begins.
At this point everyone assumed, quite reasonably -- but without, in
hindsight, anything more than circumstantial warrant -- that they were
dealing with a normal road accident and seeing typical bloody head
injuries. Further, there was a doctor present -- a pleasant, competent,
professional doctor -- who made the same assumption and reinforced the
mistake of them all.
More cars had paused to goggle. One was sent to call ambulance and
police. Dr Messer ''pulled McRae upright'' and examined him. (If this is
true why did she manipulating a casualty who, for all she knew, could
have had serious spinal injuries?) According to Scott and McLeay, she
knew that he was ''still alive . . . his chest was moving and he was
still breathing''. One of McRae's pupils was dilated, a ''sign of
extensive brain damage''. She estimated he had been in that position for
10 hours -- putting the time of the incident about midnight. And the
assumption of timing has stood, ever since.
The ambulance came from Fort Augustus with its sole driver. Coutts,
Messer, Lochhead, and the driver began the difficult job of removing
McRae from the car. They appear to have wrenched the door open -- a
little way -- but it was impossible to open fully. And McRae was a ''big
bloke''.
It was now raining heavily. A young constable arrived from Fort
William. He calmly found a hold-all in the car and asked Coutts to
gather the various effects. Should the constable have known better? Like
everyone else -- who, in fairness, argues with a doctor? -- he must have
assumed it was a normal road smash. Nevertheless it was a total
coach-and-horses through the manual of the Northern Constabulary. The
scene of what would be, within hours, a homicide investigation was being
trodden, pawed, manhandled, and wrecked by a dozen helping hands and
friendly feet.
As Coutts gathered McRae's belongings he noticed that the rear window
was partially smashed. (The front screen, all but the ambulance driver
later agreed, was intact.) He also noticed a heap of other papers, away
from the car -- ''meticulously ripped up'' -- topped, in a weird
pyramid, by McRae's smashed watch and a garage bill with McRae's name on
it. Flashing this before the constable, according to Scott and McLeay,
Coutts convinced the constable that the victim was, indeed, Mr William
McRae.
Coutts later claimed that, as they wrestled with McRae's rubbery body,
the constable's cap fell off. Coutts says he bent to pick it up, saw
right under the car and the driver's door, and saw nothing. This point
was later critical. According to Scott and McLeay, there was ''no sign
of a briefcase'' in the effects Coutts collected. ''Nor any cartons of
cigarettes . . . McRae took his briefcase with him everywhere . . .
likewise he always had a large carton of cigarettes . . . '' The effects
Coutts did gather totalled ''a couple of books, a Bible, a half-consumed
half-bottle of whisky''.
Ambulance, McRae, and Dr Messer travelled to Raigmore Hospital -- a
journey of under two hours. There, it was quickly decided to transfer
McRae to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary -- ''standard procedure in . . . any
type of head injury''. He was put on a life-support machine on arrival
at Forresterhill. It was in Aberdeen that someone, unknown, probably a
nurse cleaning his head, suspected for the first time that this was no
mere road accident. McRae was X-rayed and a bullet detected in his head.
His brain was macerated and his vital functions all but gone. (One nurse
later claimed there were two bullets in McRae's head; she may have been
confused by different X-ray shots.)
Early on Sunday April 7, after consultation with next of kin -- Dr
Ferguson McRae, brother, and his wife Moira, both present; Ronnie Welsh,
friend, rung for opinion -- Willie McRae's life-support machine was
switched off. His death certificate sets formal time of demise at
3.30am.
* * *
THE farce wound up a gear.
Chief Superintendent Andrew Lester, head of Northern CID, took over
the investigation immediately. Yet, and before any weapon had been
found, the car was calmly removed at midday on Sabbath, April 7.
On Monday a weapon was found, in the burn over which the car had lain
-- under a ''deep, narrow overhang'', according to Scott and McLeay, who
happily -- without a word of proof -- describe it as a ''Smith and
Wesson 45 revolver'' (presumably a .45, though the decimal mark is
missing from their text). They continue: ''Two shots had been fired. The
only fingerprints on the revolver were McRae's. The bullet in McRae's
head was from his revolver''. For none of this do they cite a single
source. Some key elements are in fact untrue.
They also assert that the gun's location -- some 20 yards from the car
-- is not in dispute either. And it was this assertion -- repeated
within weeks of McRae's death, and which would go unrefuted by any
authority for a full five years -- which, more than anything else, has
fathered talk of murder and talk of conspiracy.
A man who has just shot himself in the head cannot then fling the
weapon of self-murder a distance of 60 feet. And other questions began
to surface. What about McRae's personal belongings? It was ''common
knowledge'' that his briefcase, files, cigarettes, and a souvenir #100
note were missing when he was found.
Yet the farce compounded.
Two years later, when friends of Willie McRae decided to erect a
permanent memorial on the site, local SDP/Alliance councillor John
Farquhar Munro -- without consultation -- gaily tipped a truckload of
rock on his selected spot as the basis of a huge cairn. But, when the
site was dedicated in April 1987, David Coutts repudiated it. He was
adamant it was the wrong spot; that he and his friends had found McRae
nearly one and half miles farther south.
The dispute is important: Coutts's site was in Lochaber District, and
thus the relevant procurator-fiscal was at Fort William. But McRae's
case was in the hands of Thomas Aitchison, procurator-fiscal at
Inverness. Coutts later wrote to Aitchison, in 1987, politely asking for
confirmation of the site of incident. He was surprised to receive in
reply a hectoring letter, not from the procurator-fiscal, but from the
Solicitor-General -- ignoring the question at issue.
Information I have received now suggests that neither Aitchison nor
Fraser could, in fact, confirm the site of the incident -- because the
official grid reference from the Northern Constabulary, which one or
both should have checked, was fantastic and absurd. Hence the refusal to
answer David Coutts's most reasonable question: the authorities did not
know.
It was to Inverness that McRae's body went for autopsy -- where Dr
Henry Richmond, local forensic pathologist, was in charge of the
post-mortem. Scott and McLeay question this. There was a more
experienced forensic pathologist on hand in Aberdeen, they say -- Dr W T
Hendry -- who had dealt with several gunshot victims.
Richmond had to conduct his autopsy without the gun -- which was still
missing, say the authors. He had to deal with a man who had survived
fatal wounding and been repeatedly washed and treated. And Dr Richmond
was almost certainly not experienced on gunshot cases. (Dr Richmond
refused to confirm or deny this; he has since retired.)
No-one, not even Dr Ferguson McRae, apart from the Crown Office and
the investigating authorities involved, has seen Dr Richmond's final
report -- or any of the other papers in the McRae file. David Coutts was
at length permitted by the Northern Constabulary to view photographs of
the scene. It failed to clarify his mind on the site. (The area, in
fairness, is bewilderingly barren and alike to the southern mind.)
Coutts later claimed that one or two photographs showed an x marking the
spot where the gun was found -- subsequent to the removal of the car.
The Northern Constabulary refused Scott and McLeay access to the
photographs.
There has never been a Sudden Death Inquiry into Willie McRae's death.
Though even in June 1985 Aitchison kept the possibility open -- ''all
sorts of factors are coming in''; it has been suggested that a highly
secret investigation had begun into the conduct of the Northern
Constabulary -- the file was closed in July. It remains officially
''undetermined'' -- the Scots equivalent to the ''open'' verdict of an
English inquest. The off-the-record ''spin'' put on events, by various
senior law officers, has been one of suicide. Liberal MP Archy Kirkwood,
and others, were -- variously -- given broad hints that McRae was
homosexual; that he had psychiatric problems; that he had business
troubles; that he was facing a third drink-driving charge after two
convictions; that he had spoken of suicide to some close to him.
Scott and McLeay openly finger the jovial Peter Fraser, then MP for
Angus East, Solicitor-General for Scotland. In fairness, Fraser was in
an awkward position. At the 1983 General Election he had fended off his
Nationalist predecessor in the Angus seat -- Andrew Welsh -- by only
3527 votes. In 1985 he was highly vulnerable to charges of making
personal capital out of the decidedly odd death of a Scottish
Nationalist. (Welsh did, indeed, topple Fraser in 1987.)
Nevertheless the Solicitor-General's behaviour is decidedly odd. He
enthusiastically adopted a high profile in the McRae case. He consulted
none other than Gordon Wilson, SNP national chairman, to see if his
party wanted an inquiry. The Nationalists, in fact, were clamouring for
one -- but Wilson, having consulted McRae's relatives, said no. Glasgow
Central Labour MP Bob McTaggart, and David Coutts, fought desperately
for a public inquiry. They were reluctantly silenced as the objections
of the McRae family became apparent. They -- especially Dr Ferguson
McRae -- were highly hostile to talk of an FAI. This, of course,
strengthened the suicide hypothesis; was there was some terrible thing
the McRaes wanted kept quiet? Yet, in July 1985, the Crown Office said
bluntly: ''No further information on the circumstances of this death
will be made public.''
Still, Gordon Wilson -- hassled by his own followers -- appointed
Winnie Ewing to carry out an internal SNP investigation. What Ewing
learned about McRae's death troubled her. She wrote to one or two senior
colleagues, concluding: ''In my opinion this was not suicide.'' In the
spring of 1987 Mrs Ewing applied -- as a Scots lawyer -- for sight of
the relevant Crown Office papers, offering the customary oath of
confidentiality if, on examination, she was satisfied it was indeed
suicide. She had a list of 33 unanswered questions pertinent to the
case.
Permission, in a crass act of public relations, was bluntly denied.
And then, to general astonishment, the SNP gave up. No prominent
Nationalist has since immersed himself in the McRae mystery. It only
fuelled the lunatic fringe -- now convinced that McRae had been a key
subversive, finally silenced by the British State, whom even the SNP
were desperate to disown.
The former Solicitor-General, now Lord Fraser of Carmyllie was forced
into new admissions in April 1990, pressured by none other than Nicholas
Fairbairn. Fraser, in a letter made public, ''reluctantly'' confirmed
that McRae died of a contact wound in the head, and that the gun had
been found beneath where the door of the car had been. These two points
supported the suicide view. So why were they not made long before?
Bizarrely, in April 1987 -- off the record to television's Roger Cook
-- Fraser reportedly said: ''I don't think the gun was found 40 to 50
feet away, though it was certainly further away than it would have been
if it had just fallen from his grasp and it is unlikely, given his head
injury, that he could have thrown it . . . '' (Lord Fraser has denied
ever saying this.) He continued: ''I agree that the angle he was lying
at and the recoil from the gun is far more likely to have resulted in
his arm being found outside the window . . . ''
The truth is that the likeable, bouncy peer must rue the prominent
stance he took on the McRae case in 1985, and his decision not to push
for an inquiry. Ten years later the story has refused to go away. And
Lord Fraser has become the Demon King to all convinced of murder and
cover-up. It must haunt him to this day.
A decade after his death, McRae is now more famous for his weird
passing than his lively life. His shooting has become a PR industry.
Such creepy fellows as David Dinsmore and Adam Busby -- out-and-proud
SNLA terrorists -- have claimed links to McRae; said the ''secret
state'' was shadowing him; even described -- and supplied registration
numbers -- of Special Branch cars that followed him. One (PSJ 136X, a
Triumph) did indeed prove a ''blocked vehicle'' when a journalist
checked it on a police computer; it was either Special Branch or MI5.
This according to Scott and McLeay; more anon.
Yet one need not believe the paranoid theories of State-murder. There
may be a more innocent, if nearly as awkward, explanation of the
reluctance of authority to investigate. Like a compounding, convoluted
chain of blunders -- ''Whisky Galore'' jurisprudence in the North -- in
the wet spring of 1985.
And too many would-be investigators today, eager to nail the McRae
mystery once and for all, who start in the wrong place. With theories
advanced by some eager that McRae be buried in history as a sad old
failure who killed himself. And, equally, theories from all manner of
folk that McRae was ''sanctioned'' by one of any number of nefarious or
official organisations, whose vital interests he threatened.
The answer to the mystery of Willie McRae must lie not in gossip, nor
conspiracy, but in the cold facts of a bloodied body, a mangled car, and
a windswept moor.
And these facts -- or, at least, the map to the right questions -- lie
in a buff folder, perhaps three inches thick, starting with a little
plastic-covered album of colour photographs. It looks for all the world
like an estate agent's housing schedules. No journalist had ever
glimpsed it. But it holds the key to that killing in the glen -- and I
have seen it.

<HEADLINE>Sinn Fein wants talks to begin 'next week'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979189977</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE first meeting between a British Minister and Sinn Fein should take
place next week, leading republican Martin McGuinness said yesterday.
Mr McGuinness said he believed talks with Northern Ireland Minister
Michael Ancram would go ahead despite continuing disagreement over the
issue of ''demilitarisation''.
''I think there is a great expectation now that a meeting with Sinn
Fein and British Government Ministers will take place some time next
week and I think many people will be disappointed if that does not turn
out to be the case,'' he told BBC1's On the Record programme.
Expectations that Mr Ancram would join exploratory talks with Sinn
Fein was raised after he met the leaders of parties linked to the
loyalist paramilitaries for the first time last week.
However, the process hit a stumbling block when Sinn Fein said that
the withdrawal of British troops and the position of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary must be on the agenda -- a demand rejected by the
Government.
Despite Mr McGuinness's confidence that talks would take place, there
appeared to be no softening of Sinn Fein's position on the issue.
''The British Government and its Army are very much a part of the
equation and that aspect of it needs to be discussed because its of
great importance to our people,'' he said.
The latest moves came as Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and his
deputy Dick Spring prepared to hold talks with Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams in Dublin on Tuesday about the current state of the peace process.
Earlier, a leading Protestant churchman criticised Unionist
politicians for their negative response to the framework document on the
future of Northern Ireland.
Dr James Mehaffey, Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, warned that they were
threatening the peace process.
''I am very disappointed at the reaction of Unionist politicians in
particular, because almost before the ink on the Framework Document was
dry, they were rejecting it lock, stock and barrel,'' he told Radio 4's
Sunday programme.
''That emotional and very decisive rejection . . . was a serious
situation because I think everyone in Northern Ireland realises that the
future is by dialogue, it is by discussion and it is by compromise --
whatever your political point of view, there is no other way to achieve
a settlement.''
Dr Mehaffey was a member of a delegation of Church of Ireland bishops
who met John Major last week.
Mr Peter Robinson, MP, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
said the bishop should spend more time on his church and less on
politics.
''If he was in better contact with his flock, he would know how out of
step he is with Unionist thinking,'' he added.
Mr Robinson said he was fed up with the ''imbecilic gibberish'' coming
from Church of Ireland Bishops.

THREE climbers were recovering in hospital yesterday after being
hurled 300ft down the side of the Window gully on Creag Meagaidh by an
avalanche. Two companions also swept down the mountain near Loch Laggan,
Inverness-shire, escaped without injury.
Members of Cairngorm and Lochaber mountain rescue teams were called
out, and a helicopter scrambled from RAF Lossiemouth, on Saturday
Climbers had been warned of a risk of avalanches. The three injured
were taken by helicopter to Belfort Hospital, Fort William and later
transferred to Raigmore Hospital Inverness
Police have not named the casualties, bit their injuries are not
thought to be life-threatening. They and their companions had been
involved in an ice climb when they were engulfed by the avalanche on the
sheer cliffs of Coire Ardair.
Members of Kintail mountain rescue team and an RAF rescue helicopter
from Lossiemouth were last night heading for Kintail after a report that
a female climber had fallen 200ft near the Five Sisters of Kintail.
Yesterday, rescuers called off a search of Observatory Ridge, Ben
Nevis when two male climbers, who had been seen last on Saturday
morning, walked off the mountain.
A teacher was released from hospital yesterday after falling and
suffering a leg injury on Ben Wyvis in Ross-shire. Mr James Hood, 51,
from Dollar, Clackmannanshire, was helping to lead a group of Army
Cadets. They had reached the summit and were on their way down when Mr
Hood slipped.
In the Lake District, three climbers were airlifted after an overnight
rescue operation. The climbers, believed to be suffering from
hypothermia, were found at Esk Hause near Scafell Pike by Langdale and
Ambleside Mountain Rescue Team, assisted by members of the RAF Valley
team.
Poor weather conditions prevented a helicopter from reaching them
during the night. They were treated at the scene and at first light
flown to hospital at Whitehaven by a helicopter from RAF Boulmer.
Meanwhile, skiers flocked to Cairngorm for the centre's annual Snow
Festival which attracted 10,000 people over the weekend. The event
raised cash for the Uphill Ski Club which helps disabled people to ski
and the Fighting Against Cancer in the Highlands campaign.
At the Nevis Range centre near Fort William, 3000 skiers enjoyed good
conditions over the weekend. But the summer season got off to a poor
start at Glencoe where the White Corries ski centre was stormbound with
winds gusting up to 75mph.

<TEXT>
THE Scottish Tourist Board's Gateway Information Centre at Gretna is
draining the local tourist board's funds, it is claimed.
The centre, which is in its second year of operation, is run by the
Dumfries and Galloway Tourist Board for the STB. But an assessment made
by the local board says that it cost them almost #17,000 to operate last
year -- money it cannot afford.
Many Dumfries and Galloway Tourist Board members say that, in
addition, most of the 100,000 people a year who use the centre have
already made up their minds where they are going -- north and not into
South-west Scotland.
Mr Clive Hartley, the acting director of tourism in Dumfries and
Galloway, said yesterday: ''My visitors' services sub-committee has
expressed particular concern about the high net cost to the board of
operating Gretna Gateway TIC, particularly in relation to the relatively
small number of local area bookings.
''It is their conclusion that, whilst Gretna Gateway plays a very
important national role, it is well down the rankings in terms of its
contribution to the Dumfries and Galloway economy.''
The Scottish Tourist Board is being asked to increase its #9000
contribution to the projected deficit of #27,440 for 1993-94.
Mr Hartley said that, when the centre was at the planning stage,
assurances were given by STB staff that Dumfries and Galloway would not
suffer any undue drain on its resources as a result of taking over
responsibility for managing it, and that it might be expected to
generate a small profit.
He added: ''This has clearly not turned out to be the case.''

BRAEMAR Mountain Rescue Team is furious at what it regards as claims
that it benefitted from cash paid to a woman for the story of her
rescue.
The row centres on money paid by two newspapers for the tale of how a
school secretary survived for 43 hours on a mountain in the Highlands
last winter.
Mrs Jackie Greaves, 52, was found by a sniffer-dog under the snow
after falling through an overhanging cornice on 3788-ft Derry Cairngorm.
Her story was re-enacted on Michael Aspel's Caught on Camera real-life
drama series, which was screened on ITV on Saturday evening.
However, the leader of Braemar Mountain Rescue team, Police Sergeant
Graham Gibb, yesterday fired off a protest to the programme-makers.
Sgt Gibb, who co-operated with the filming by staging a re-enactment
of the February 1994 rescue in which he played a key part, was unhappy
at the suggestion the team had benefited from the #20,000 which Mrs
Greaves is believed to have been paid for her story.
Sgt Gibb, who was on duty at the Glenshee ski slopes yesterday, said
he had telephoned London Weeekend Television protesting about the ending
of the programme and pointing out that all the Braemar team had got from
her was a short ''thank-you'' note.
He said: ''There was a clear inference that our team had got the cash.
That was most unfortunate because we rely on donations.
''We need over #40,000-a-year to keep the Braemar team running. We
were not looking for money from Mrs Greaves, but a statement like that
made during the programme makes fund-raising more difficult for us.''
The programme talked about a vehicle Mrs Greaves had donated to
mountain rescuers, while it said she had also paid for the upkeep and
training of a sniffer-dog.
Sgt Gibb, who is stationed at Ballater, Aberdeenshire, said: ''I have
checked with the Scottish Search and Rescue Dog Association, who
confirmed that they, too, had received nothing from the woman.
''But I have heard through the grapevine she did replace a damaged and
written-off vehicle belonging to a team in the Lake District.
''I understand she takes school parties up there, and I think the dog
referred to is also to be available for call-outs on English hills.
''They have a separate dog association there.''
Mrs Greaves, of Rowan Avenue, Lowton, near Wigan, Lancashire, was
unavailable for comment yesterday.
A spokeswoman for LWT, who made the programme, said the company was
aware donations had not been made to Braemar Mountain Rescue Team. She
said: ''We are confident we did not mislead anyone since we deliberately
did not mention any particular team. What we said was that she had put
some of the money back into mountain rescue services.''

POLICE are treating as suspicious a fire that badly damaged a Fife
hotel. Three members of staff and six customers at the Woodside Hotel,
Aberdour, had to be evacuated from the building. No-one was injured.
The fire broke out just before midnight on Saturday and took the fire
brigade nearly two hours to bring under control.
Diversions were enforced after building control officers declared the
building unsafe. The roof and the centre-piece of the hotel, a tower
surmounted by a weathercock, were badly damaged. Other parts suffered
water damage.
A Fife police spokesman said: ''We are treating this matter as a
suspicious incident and would like to speak to anyone who may have seen
anything out of the ordinary just prior to or just after it.''
Another fire, also being treated by detectives and fire officers as
suspicious, badly damaged a public house in Larkhall early yesterday.
A police forensic scientist and a fire service investigation team were
sifting through blackened debris at the Glen Avon Public House at
Carlisle Road.
The alarm was raised at 3.45am after reports of an explosion, but
police said the noise was probably ''the windows going out''. Fire teams
found the building blazing.
A spokesman for Strathclyde police said: ''The fire, which appears to
have been deliberately set, has completely destroyed the lounge area of
the pub and the remainder of the building has been damaged by smoke.''
The building, which stands alone, was empty and no-one was injured.
Fire also badly damaged the ground floor of the County Hotel,
Dalkeith, Midlothian, early yesterday.
* The widow of a man killed in the Piper Alpha disaster died yesterday
in a fire at a hotel in Torquay. The body of 37-year-old Lorraine Da
Silva was found in a bedroom at the Ambergate Hotel after the building
was severely damaged in a blaze which began in the basement.
Her husband Jose, 40, a steward on the North Sea platform Piper Alpha,
was one of 167 who died in the inferno in July 1988. The couple's
11-year-old son Scott was rescued unconscious from yesterday's blaze by
Mrs Da Silva's common-law husband Kelvin Ricketts with whom she ran the
hotel.
Mrs Da Silva's brother, Cameron Henry, carried Scott to safety from
the blazing hotel in Solsbro Road, Torquay. A total of eight people,
including Mrs Da Silva's other son Ross, 10, were treated at Torbay
hospital.

THE Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland warned
yesterday of the dangers of ''bad religion''.
The Right Rev Dr James Simpson, speaking in Cumbernauld, said that, of
all the ugly and evil things in this world, religion that had gone bad
was probably the worst.
In his sermon at Kildrum Parish Church he referred to the Buddhist
sect which Japanese police believe is linked to the gas attack on the
Tokyo subway which left 10 people dead and 5000 in hospital, 70 of whom
are still in a critical condition.
Dr Simpson said: ''The recent revelations about the Buddhist sect, Aum
Shinri Kyo, the so-called sect of Supreme Truth, and the call of their
leader to carry out his salvation plan for the world, which would
involve their own destruction and other people's, highlighted what the
Bible is at pains to prove.
''The Bible is not only a magnificent exposition of life-enriching
religion, it keeps exposing bad religion.''
Dr Simpson said that some of the greatest problems facing our world
stemmed from religion without Christ-like caring, forgiving love at the
heart of it.
''Extreme fundamentalism -- whether it be Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist,
Jewish, or Christian fundamentalism -- can be divisive, manifesting
itself in bigotry, intolerance, and hostility towards people of other
religions or no religion.
''Some people speak as though they had God in their hip-pocket, as
though God's chief business is to take care of them and prosper whatever
they do.
''You may think it strange for someone like myself, who is in what we
might call the retail side of the religious business, to say these
things.
''You might think it is like sawing through the branch on which I am
sitting. But I say these things because, unfortunately, I believe they
are true.
''I say them also because the Bible keeps saying the same thing: bad
religion can be a blight, rather than a blessing, on the human race.''
Dr Simpson added that he shuddered to think how many people have been
put off the church by narrow-minded dogmatists or religion that
sanctified trivialities.

<TEXT>
TWO species of butterfly, which have been extinct for more than 75
years, could be flitting through the British countryside once again,
thanks to advances in genetic science.
The Large Copper and Chequered Skipper butterflies died out in this
country because hedgerows, which provided the insects with food, were
destroyed.
Now English Nature hopes to reintroduce the eye-catching creatures to
Britain from the Continent by matching DNA samples extracted from museum
exhibits with DNA found in existing butterflies.
Leslie Cram, principal keeper of collections at Reading Museum, in
Berkshire, said there was a good chance that a colony would be traced
which was a close match with exhibits displayed at the museum.
''It will be two to three years, if the matching were successful,
before the butterflies would be seen in the UK,'' he said.
The butterflies would have a good chance of survival, he added,
because parts of Britain were now protected from development.

THE chairman of Hamilton Academical FC is due to hold an emergency
board meeting today amid claims that property deals involving former and
current directors have damaged the club.
Mr David Campbell said a huge profit was made on land sold to the club
by a group of directors, which included former chairman Mr George
Fulston.
Mr Campbell said the emergency meeting would discuss a number of
profitable property deals, including those by a company called Flayest
Ltd. Mr Fulston was one of a group of five directors who formed Flayest
in the mid 1980s.
According to Mr Fulston, the firm was set up to buy land around the
club's Douglas Park stadium to prevent outside developers moving in.
Mr Fulston said several properties and pockets of land had been bought
by Flayest. One of those, a six-acre car park site, was bought for
around #80,000 nine years ago and recently sold as part of a #1.1m deal.
At the time, Mr Fulston was a director of both Flayest and Hamilton
Academical.
Mr Fulston, a fork-lift truck businessman and chairman of Falkirk,
admitted the land was sold to developers for a much higher sum than the
original purchase price, but he added that the site had been improved
and land values had soared since the original deal. Each Flayest
director received around #90,000, he said.
He added: ''There were big fears that someone would come along and buy
it, so Flayest bought it instead and allowed Hamilton to use it as a car
park and training ground for nine years without charge. We were holding
the fort for the club -- and we were holding on to land we could hardly
afford ourselves.
''If someone is saying we walked away and did something wrong it
surprises me. I gave everything in 13 years at Hamilton both physically
and financially. I did accept my share of the money, but I did not walk
away with any benefit.''
Mr Fulston claimed he had invested huge sums in Falkirk -- several
times the #90,000 he made on the land deal.
He added that he had also rejected an initial valuation which would
have led to greater profit margins. Of the #1.1m, he said #250,000 had
been used to pay fees owed to Flayest and other companies and #250,000
was from another land deal.
He added: ''Nothing was over the top. I don't feel ill at ease with
the amount of money in my share -- I left Hamilton cleanly. This was
prime land in the centre of Hamilton -- the ground round about the site
was bought for more.''
Hamilton chairman Mr Campbell said the deals involved had been drawn
up before he joined the board last year.
The club has a number of cash problems, but it is not thought to be
facing closure. Hamilton have been playing home games at Partick
Thistle's ground since Douglas Park closed down for safety reasons in
August, but there are still plans to develop the stadium.

<HEADLINE>Spending bias is towards London, says Swinney SNP hits back at tax subsidy claim</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish National Party has hit back at claims that Scotland is
heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers.
Treasury spokesman John Swinney argued yesterday that tax and spending
patterns in the UK had an in-built bias towards London and the south of
England -- a fact unionist politicians dared not admit, he said, because
it ''destroys at a stroke the myth of the subsidised Scot''.
His remarks followed Friday's concerted attack by Prime Minister John
Major and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke on devolution. Mr Major warned that
a devolved Scottish Parliament could cost Scottish taxpayers an extra
20p in the pound to maintain current levels of public spending.
The SNP is concerned that attacks by senior Tories on Labour's
devolution plans are spilling over into a general attack on Scotland's
ability to stand alone as an independent country. The Nationalists see
the issues as quite separate, claiming that while Labour's devolution
plans may have their economic problems, the same is not true of
independence in Europe.
It is one of the reasons why the party is launching a fresh campaign
on the economic benefits of independence in Europe.
Mr Swinney quoted a raft of figures which he says shows that it is
London and the south which swallows up Government spending, not
Scotland. He stated that while ''Unionist scaremongers'' liked to quote
identifiable public expenditure, they omitted the #45bn worth of
unidentified spending, which is not identified on an area basis, but the
majority of which nonetheless is spent in the south.
About half the total is defence spending, and the SNP says that 56% of
it goes straight into the local economy of the south of England, while
Scotland received significantly less than its population share.
Another #3500m goes towards the Foreign Office budget, and again the
vast bulk is spent in London and the South-east. Nearly all of the UK's
top 50,000 Civil Service jobs are based in and around London, and the
area also benefited from massive transport subsidies such as the road
and rail access improvements to London Docklands.
Mr Swinney argued: ''Scotland contributes a higher percentage of
Treasury receipts than our share of the UK's population. In part this is
due to oil revenues, which are increasing substantially, and also
because we contribute more in terms of business rates, council rents,
and certain items of taxable expenditure.
''In addition there are specific subsidies from Scotland to England
endemic in the taxation system. For example, although mortgage tax
relief is declining in value, it was still worth #3500m in 1994/95. Of
this, 45% went to the south of England, with Scotland getting only
6.5%.''
* Labour's Scottish campaign co-ordinator Irene Adams has claimed that
the SNP administrations in Tayside and Grampian have broken ''promise
after promise'' since being elected.
She pointed out that the Nationalists had promised a #10 payment for
pensioners' winter fuel bills, and vowed to protect meals-on-wheels,
home helps and concessionary bus fares.
''Once elected they tore up these promises. It seems SNP promises
aren't worth the #10 they're written on,'' she said.
The SNP argues that it was forbidden by law from delivering the #10
payment, but that in any case its alternative help schemes were worth
more in the end than the #10.

A REMARKABLE collection of Elvis Presley records, books, and
memorabilia is to be auctioned in Scotland. More than 500 items,
charting the King of rock's career, are to be sold as one lot at William
Hardie and Co., in West Regent Street, Glasgow.
Mr Paul Howard, a spokesman for the auctioneers, said: ''We are
anticipating quite a bit of excitement from Elvis fans, far and wide.
The entire collection was compiled by a Glasgow man between 1956 and the
present day.'' The archive contains rare early 78rpm 10in singles from
the 1950s, sought-after foreign import LPs, EPs and 7in singles from
Russia, the USA, Japan, Germany, Canada, Australia, Canada, France,
Denmark, Spain and Italy, and scarce bootleg recordings.
Experts who have valued the collection say it could fetch up to #8000
for the publicity-shy enthusiast. But the sky's the limit.

<HEADLINE>Tax plan 'could devastate transport museum'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>RON MACKENNA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE convener of Glasgow's museums and art galleries last night called
on Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney to see sense over a plan to
tax cars whether they are on the road or not.
Councillor Frank McAveety warned that if classic and vintage vehicles
were not exempted from the proposals Glasgow's transport museum could be
devastated.
The Government is considering an exemption plan, but no guarantees
have been made.
Mr McAveety said the prospect of the transport museum being saddled
with a huge tax bill was horrifying.
He said: ''It would be a heavy burden on the city and would affect the
viability of the museum. If there is no exemption we will in effect have
a tax on people's leisure. That cannot be right.
''It is clear that one department of the Government is not speaking to
another.
''We have the Department of Transport continuing the Conservatives'
policy of 'if it moves tax it' yet the Department of National Heritage
should be protecting museums.''
When the tax changes were first proposed last summer, the Federation
of British Historic Vehicle Clubs, which represents about 300,000
classic car owners, sent a letter to Dr Mawhinney pleading for
exemption.
Last September the federation's president, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu,
met Transport Minister Steven Norris.
Lord Montagu said afterwards that he had been assured the Government
had no intention of trying to make money out of the old car movement.
The Government is also expected to announce this week new arrangements
for the paperwork involved when cars are bought and sold.
At present, both buyer and seller have to send separate forms to the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at Swansea.
The new proposals would involve just the one form and avoid cars
getting ''lost'' to the system through paperwork going astray.
* The Government is wrong to lumber motorists with much of the burden
of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, says an independent report for the
AA published today.
The main anti-CO2 measure involves an annual rise of 5% in petrol
prices, says the report from the UK Centre for Economic and
Environmental Development.
The report goes on to say that this measure is extremly expensive
compared with cost estimates of other reduction methods and is out of
line with levels of tax elsewhere in the economy.

DIARY readers may recall a recent item detailing some obstacles that
lie in the path of Jack McGinn proceeding, courtesy of Buggin's turn, to
the post of president of the Scottish Football Association.
McGinn, currently vice-president of the SFA, has long represented the
Celtic Football and Athletic Company on the ruling body. Even when he
was deposed as chairman and Fergus McCann's new regime took over, McGinn
was allowed to remain on the SFA.
Then came the financial restructuring at Parkhead. The Celtic Football
and Athletic Company became Celtic plc. Celtic plc bought an off-the-peg
company called Pacific Shelf 595 Ltd and renamed it the Celtic Football
and Athletic Company.
But it is Celtic plc which is registered with the SFA and Jack McGinn
is not an officer of that company. So his days of power and influence,
not to mention trips with the boys, look to be over.
Except that I hear of a ploy by the ever-resourceful Jack. If he can
hitch his wagon to another club and become a director, his SFA career
can continue. This would be quite an amazing set of affairs and we would
be stunned to see Jack joining, for instance, the board of Dumbarton FC.
* NEWS of another great moment not broadcast on BBC Scotland TV sport.
As part of the run-up to the Twickenham game, the fragrant Hazel Irvine
was doing a piece on rugby in Shetland.
One of the Shetlanders was filmed running the line wearing a kilt and
a Viking helmet. As part of her research, Hazel had been told that this
zany character's nickname was Biscuit.
Why are you called Biscuit, she duly asked, at which point the said
Biscuit lifted the front of his kilt and said: ''Because it's a
cracker.''
* ON THE subject of nicknames, I hear that Ian Ferguson of Rangers is
known to his team-mates as Sid the Snake and his colleague Andy Goram as
Silkie.
These are both puzzling, since Ferguson appears to be a perfectly nice
chap and silkiness is a quality more likely to be found in a midfielder
than a goalkeeper. Perhaps someone out there can explain.
THE Wit and Wisdom of the Crowd: The scene was Twickenham during a
break in play where Victor Imbogo was changing out of his ripped shorts.
''Victor Imbogo,'' said a voice in the temporary silence. ''Not so much
a name, more a bad hand at Scrabble.''
* I DON'T suppose England skipper Will Carling endeared himself any
further to certain sections of the Scottish support when he was seen
crossing himself before the Grand Slam game.
* BEING a Partick Thistle sympathiser, if not exactly a supporter, it
has been great to see the Jags going undefeated for the whole of the
month of March. This was the excuse I gave myself, were any needed, to
be in the Bar Booshka, a licensed establishment in Old Dumbarton Road
which offers the widest range of vodkas outside of Boris Yeltsin's
drinks cabinet.
I was there to sample a flavour of football-terracing tradition. The
macaroon bar-flavoured vodka. How does it taste, I hear you ask. Exactly
how you would expect macaroon bars marinaded in vodka to taste. Absolut
delicious.
Missing, however, from Bar Booshka list was a spearmint chewing-gum
flavour vodka. They have a Clorets flavour, but I can't recall any wee
men in bunnets prowling the terraces shouting: ''The macaroon bars and
the Clorets breath-fresheners!''
* A PRIZE for secrecy of masonic proportions goes to the Scottish
Sports Aid Foundation, who held their awards dinner last week.
We would like to tell you who was chosen as their sporting personality
of the year from a short leet of six headed by Melanie Neef. But we
cannot, since the Scottish Sports Aid Foundation chose not to invite any
of the news-gathering media to attend. Nor have they announced to a
waiting world the results of their deliberations.
Bet the Bank of Scotland, who have just announced a three-year
sponsorship investment in the foundation, are delighted at this high
public profile.

SHE was always a bit of a grunter, really. But she could be forgiven
for that, at least by most, because she also happened to be the best
woman tennis player in the world.
With her seering ground-strokes and iron determination, Monica Seles
cut down the best and leapfrogged her German rival Steffi Graf to the
top of the rankings.
Her future seemed assured. At 19, she was already the holder of a
clutch of grand-slam titles. Always laughing and smiling, she delighted
in the attention, and if she wasn't in the sports news, she could be
seen posing in Chanel on the fashion pages.
Tennis has been her life. Initially she was taught by her father,
Karolj, a cartoonist and television director. To keep her interested in
practising, he would draw pictures of Tom and Jerry on the tennis balls.
She began playing tournament tennis at nine. It must have been hard to
keep any kind of perspective in such a cocoon.
Then, in April 1993, she went to Hamburg and was attacked by an
obsessive Graf fan who stabbed her in the back with a kitchen knife as
she sat on a bench during a match. He believed that by disabling the
leading player, his idol could return to the top.
Seles, now 21, has not played again since. There has been talk of more
putative comebacks than Lord Lucan but, as with him, she's failed to
materialise.
The girl who was born in Yugoslavia, but who has lived most of her
life in Florida, has become an American citizen.
Now isolated behind the walls of her home in Sarasota, she is said to
continue to practise, and last week there was speculation that she might
be included in the American team for the Federation Cup. When the team
was announced, her name wasn't there.
Instead Martina Navratilova, who rode off into the sunset on a Harley
Davidson after having retired from singles competition last November,
was a surprise inclusion.
Seles is said to be eager to play at the Olympics in Atlanta next
year, but with every month away from the circuit, her reappearance seems
increasingly remote.
Last week, too, her attacker, Guenter Parche, 40, was back in court.
He had been given a two-year suspended sentence in October 1993 but
Seles has appealed for him to be given a stiffer sentence.
In a letter read to the court, she said: ''I want proper justice. The
attack tremendously and irreparably changed my life and stopped my
tennis career, for which I worked so hard all my life.''
Seles wants the sentence increased to five years in jail, and that her
attacker be sentenced for attempted manslaughter instead of causing
grievous bodily harm.
He says there is no question of him injuring anyone again. ''I
couldn't even steal a bar of chocolate from a supermarket.'' A decision
in the case is expected later this week.
Undoubtedly, the incident has had a deep psychological and emotional
effect on a woman who had the tennis world at her feet. But if she is
genuinely keen to return to the circuit, then it seems a pity she wasn't
persuaded to do so earlier instead of putting so much emphasis on the
incident in Hamburg. Certainly a player in more straitened circumstances
wouldn't have had the luxury of choice.
It could now be that during the past two years Seles has discovered
there is more to life than the narrow perspective of how she performs
from one tournament to the next, an existence where competition is not
the keyword.
The closing of the case may prove a watershed for Seles and leave her
free to decide which path her life will take. If she can now put the
events in Germany behind her and return to the tour, her fellow players
will be happy to welcome her back.
Graf, now the world's second-ranked player, said in Florida last week:
''I haven't talked to her for a while, but I think it would be nice to
see her come back. She probably needs a little time to get into tennis
tournaments and find out how it feels to play again.''
An added comfort for Seles is that, since the attack, security has
been tightened at all the tournament venues.
Mind you, if she decides to make a comeback the next problem for the
tour will be what ranking and seeding to give to the recluse who once
was so fond of the limelight.

ANGRY nurses, midwives, and NHS workers ignored a last-minute appeal
yesterday from the Government and plan to stage nationwide
demonstrations later this week in their fight for more pay.
Organisers hope the public will back their call for an improvement on
a 1% across the board rise from the Pay Review Bodies.
Lunchtime protests are due to take place at hospitals on Thursday, and
there will be demonstrations outside health centres and ambulance
stations in most major towns and cities.
Staff will use their lunch-breaks or join in while on off-duty time.
Health minister Gerald Malone appealed to the workers to settle the
dispute without resorting to industrial action.
In a letter to the Nursing and Midwifery Staff Sides Negotiating
Council, he insisted there would be no climb-down over pay and that
''locally negotiated increases will mean that nurses get a fair and
affordable deal overall''.
He added: ''I urge all nurses, midwives and health visitors to look at
the reality on the ground rather than the gloomy rhetoric of some
ill-informed commentators.
''Of the trusts making known their intentions on pay, about 70% are
proposing to pay around 3%. I believe that this trend will continue.''
But the Royal College of Nursing dismissed the letter and said there
was nothing new in it.
Unison head of health, Bob Abberley, said: ''March 30 is going to be
one of the most important demonstrations of health staff anger.
''One per cent offers are insulting and health staffs across the
country will be making their feelings plain to the Government.
''It will also be an opportunity for public support for health
staff.''
Labour's health spokesman, Nick Brown, accused the Government of
backtracking on a pledge that all NHS trusts would be able to fund the
full award.
He said: ''Gerry Malone implies that some trusts will not be able to
meet the 2% local pay award to nurses, yet in the past the Government
has said that the money is there.
''It is grotesquely unfair that, while some nurses get their rises,
others should not -- depending only on the arbitrary workings of the
Conservatives' NHS internal market.''
The health unions argue a 1% increase would mean 25p extra a day for a
hospital cleaner, 30p for a typist, 43p for a staff nurse and 50p for a
midwife.
The Government insists trusts are willing and able to negotiate up to
a further 2% locally, but NHS staff fear that not every hospital will
award the full pay deal.
The threat of action from hospital doctors and consultants was averted
when they won a 3% pay rise with up to 5% to be agreed by trusts.

Brussels
CITIZENS of seven European Union member states -- excluding Britain --
moved through international borders without having to show passports for
the first time yesterday.
Airports and crossing points around Europe reported that the new
system worked smoothly. Along some external borders, notably the German
frontier with Poland, there was increased checking of travellers, mainly
in an attempt to reassure Germans that border security and smuggling
problems were being tackled.
The seven states are Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal. All are members of the so-called
Schengen Agreement, named after the town in Luxembourg where it was
signed.
Most other EU members are expected to join in the coming months but
Britain is determined to remain outside the grouping for the time being.
It is joined only by Ireland which feels compelled to follow the UK lead
because so much of its cross-border movements are through British ports
and airports.
The European Commission is now working on a draft directive to be
produced in the next few weeks which would require all EU states,
including the UK and Ireland, to remove internal borders.
Senior European Union figures hailed the operation of the Schengen
accord as a historic day for Europe. Among those at Zaventem Airport in
Brussels were European Parliament members who had arrived from different
countries to mark the occasion and study how it was working in practice.
Mr Fernand Herman, a Belgian Euro-MP and strong federalist, said it
was the first step towards a united and federal Europe which would have
a single currency and single army. ''Controlling 10,000 kilometres of
border will be much easier than controlling 40,000 kilometres, including
all the internal borders,'' Mr Herman said.
Staff had worked through the night to post signs giving passengers
directions to the correct control points. Airport officials and border
guards in the seven states said there were no queues and little
confusion.
The new arrangements are supported by a central computer information
system based in Strasbourg which can be used to track criminals. The
computer holds 10 million files and the names of one million people
considered undesirable.
The British Government, claiming it is concerned by the security
implications, has refused to sign Schengen. Mr Major has been pressed by
Conservative Euro-sceptics to take a hard line on the issue.
In Schengen itself, 400 people celebrated on a ship moored in the
harbour. ''This is a historic day for the seven countries, but also for
all the EU,'' Luxembourg's energy and public works minister, Mr Robert
Goebbels, told guests.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said: ''Schengen can be
understood as a precursor to complete freedom of movement in all of
Europe.''
At Frankfurt's international airport, border guards doubled the number
of control windows and 138 extra police officers were on duty as the new
system came into operation. In Paris, where #6.5m was spent on building
separate Schengen-only terminals at Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports,
the system worked smoothly and passengers generally voiced satisfaction.
There is some comfort for British passport-holders, who must still
queue when entering Schengen countries. They will continue for a while
to have more access to duty free shops. In the rush to introduce the new
system, the authorities in most Schengen countries have not yet built
them.

SOON Mike Tyson will be rich beyond his wildest dreams -- provided, of
course, he can keep the garish Don King and other manipulators away from
his earnings. That, in fact, might be the toughest scrap Tyson will face
as he steps out to live again the American dream.
A dream? Sorry, don't think so. In this case the American dream has
given way to chilling reality.
Tyson and the gang of dubious-looking characters who descended upon
him as he left an Indiana correction centre at the weekend are part of
America's living nightmare. Some of the people who will come calling at
his mansion in Ohio will be in the business of distorting honesty,
decency, and minds.
They prey on the stupid and the vulnerable, which pretty much accounts
for just about everybody over there.
Tyson, a sometimes confused and often brooding product of the mean
streets of Brownsville, Brooklyn, has just walked from one extreme to
another and if there is a spark of intelligence behind those cold, dark
eyes he should ask for his room back in the correction centre.
Inside, he was sure he was in the company of crooks, but it isn't
quite so clear-cut on the outside.
On the streets the gangsters look like the decent citizens who can do
little more than fret over the erosion of their society, which allows
wrong to be dressed up and reintroduced as right.
Morals degenerate and values are undermined a little more with every
new tide of corruption which washes over the land, and each time the
flash and the quick make a killing, leaving the public further confused.
As their grasp on reality becomes slightly more weak the Don Kings of
this world grow more surreal and rich.
They cruise by in long, shiny limousines, and when they have completed
the metamorphosis of Tyson he will re-emerge as a hero, a smiling
superstar, who has defied the odds and beaten the system.
Tyson, who was reasonably acceptable while his violence was contained
within the ropes of boxing rings, made fortunes for himself and others
as he pounded the heads and bodies of opponents desperate to stand
between him and his destiny.
In 1986 he became the youngest-ever undisputed heavyweight boxing
champion of the world. He was only 20 years old when he took the title
away from Trevor Berbick.
Black shorts, black boxing boots, and no socks, Tyson was a squat,
menacing, primeval force. Some of his victims have said a coldness
coursed through their bodies when they looked in his eyes before the
first bell. He epitomised pain and was perfect for the fight game.
When the steadying influences of Cus D'Amato and Jim Jacobs were lost
after their deaths, it was perhaps inevitable the tendency towards
criminal acts which Tyson displayed as a child would resurface. They
did, in a most despicable manner, when he raped an 18-year-old beauty
queen, Desiree Washington, in an Indianapolis hotel four years ago.
It was not long after that when King was alleged to have said the rape
charge added a little glamour to the fighter's prospects, and now it is
being reported that Tyson will become sport's first billionaire. He
probably will, too.
By the perverse logic which now applies, Tyson, who served half of a
six-year jail sentence, will not hide with guilt and shame. Instead, he
is walking towards the kind of pay-day which could run a small country
for a year.
That King, whose former accountant, the wonderfully named Joe Maffia,
produced evidence of misappropriation of Tyson's earnings, should still
be wheeling and dealing with television companies and sponsors speaks
volumes for the American way of life. Flawed? Just a little.
We are expected to believe Tyson has been in jail expanding his mind
by reading Voltaire and Tolstoy, and studying Islam, but it is unlikely
he will be applying for a job as a librarian now that he is on the
outside, and many of his companions worship their own god. It's called
Mammon.
Before much longer Tyson will be presented as a man wronged, another
black victimised by society, just like OJ Simpson, who is currently on
trial for a double murder.
If ever a business was equipped to milk the very last dime from the
brothers on the streets and also the boxing public, who will again prove
their gullibility to be infinite, it is the fight game.
Tyson's criminality will be translated swiftly into marketability, but
none of it would be possible if decency was still a valued commodity.
The public would refuse to present their money to a convicted rapist,
who is back in league with King, the convicted killer. They would say:
''No, we will not reward criminals. We will not buy your tickets.''
They would ask why Tyson should be treated with respect denied others
who have committed his kind of despicable crime. They should shun him as
they would surely turn away from the man next door if he were to rape,
and if it is true Tyson is praying to his new god, Allah, then should he
not be seeking ways of making it clear he has remorse?
It would be easier to believe he has found religion if he were to
fight again and give over much of the money generated to funding a
programme to help the kids in the ghetto he left behind in Brooklyn, or
even a rape crisis centre. The very thought would make King's hair stand
on end, not that anyone would notice.
There has been no-one like Tyson in the hurt business for years and
when he was banged up, boxing, which has had to get by with a few fat
impostors like Riddick Bowe and Oliver McCall as well as the
bible-thumper, George Foreman, lost its greatest meal ticket since Ali.
However, because the appetite now is more voracious than ever, that is
no reason to laud Tyson, yet when he steps into the ring to fight for
the heavyweight championship of the world, the mean and the greedy will
have won again.
They will sit back and count their money and American society will
have been pushed a little closer to moral bankruptcy.
Only in America would such a team be in demand, and as we look on from
afar we should be grateful that all we have to contend with are bouts of
hooliganism on and off our football pitches, some bung inquiries, and a
few allegations of attempted match-rigging.

A SECONDARY school swimming pool has been closed after health
inspectors found a contaminated sample during checks.
However, last night, Central region education officials stressed that
there was no cause for concern and no need for parents of children at
Lornshill Academy, in Tullibody Road, Alloa, and other pool users, to be
alarmed.
They categorically ruled out any link with the E-coli bacteria
contamination outbreak in West Lothian last year, which claimed the life
of an 18-month-old girl and damaged the kidneys of six other children.
No-one has been affected by the problem at Lornshill and the findings
of an environmental health investigation will be known later today.
A spokeswoman for Central Regional Council's education department
confirmed that the pool has been shut since last Wednesday. It followed
a routine check by environmental health inspectors a week earlier which
produced a contaminated sample.
The spokeswoman said: ''The pool was checked out on Wednesday, March
15, and the school was notified a week later that environmental health
would like to take a second sample.
''It takes 72 working hours to run through all the necessary tests
and, as a precautionary measure, it was felt that it was best for the
pool to be closed meantime.''

Frankfurt,
IT'S been strange this weekend watching the Russian international team
preparing for their so vital European championship clash with Scotland
on Wednesday.
Here they are in Frankfurt, a thousand miles or so from home, getting
themselves ready for a match which takes place in Moscow!
It's a little like Scotland coach Craig Brown taking his team off to
Madrid for a few days break prior to a match at Hampden.
The Americans and the Japanese in the Russian hotel watch the players
go through the lobby in their tracksuits and are left puzzled. Even the
locals cannot understand why they are here.
But when I put that question to their coach, Oleg Romantsev, he waved
his hand in the air, pointing to the luxury surroundings of the hotel
and smiled.
Then he gave me the official explanation that they were in Frankfurt
because there were no suitable training pitches available at home
because of the ravages of a Moscow winter.
But the earlier reaction seemed more believable. Here he can give his
home-based players a change from the deprivations so many still suffer
in mother Russia.
And the highly-paid exiles from around Europe are comfortable in the
surroundings that are now so much a part of their soccer lives.
They are here because Romantsev wants his players to be happy and
believes that a happy team will provide him with a victory.
That victory, if it comes, would push Russia towards the European
championship finals in England and the jackpot pay-off which would
accompany it.
Millions of pounds would be earned to help a domestic league which is
currently struggling to attract crowds.
Just last week the Russian FA completed a $9m deal for league
sponsorship with a Danish chewing-gum firm. They admitted that gates are
falling and interest waning, mainly because of the exodus of star
players to other more prosperous European nations.
That is why qualifying for the finals is a major priority.
And that is why the players are staying in #200-a-night rooms and
dining in the hotel's premier restaurant.
On the menu are such delicacies as leek parfait with smoked salmon for
around #12 a portion, veal liver at #15, pike or perch fillets at #14,
wild boar at #19, or even a fillet of Angus beef at #22.
These, though, are simply the trappings of success, or hoped-for
success, for the Russian players. The main thought for Romantsev is to
have his players in the right frame of mind to deliver victory.
He says ''I don't accept that we are going to top the group, even
though other people say that.
''Our next two games will tell me more. I will start to believe it if
we win against Scotland on Wednesday. I will fully believe it if we can
win away from home against Greece next month.
''The game this week is important for both countries. If Scotland win,
or even draw, then they will be in a good position.
''I believe I may have some surprises for Craig Brown. In fact, I will
have to have something he does not suspect, because I have several
players missing.
''Scotland are in the same position. They will not have Duncan
Ferguson and I'm sure that is something Craig Brown will regret.
''But he does have the spirit which is always so prevalent in the
Scottish game, and, added to that, he has the ability of your captain.
''Gary McAllister is a world-class player. Everything in the Scotland
team depends on him. He is very impressive. He makes problems for me and
my team because of his vision and his passing ability.
''In fact, the midfield is perhaps the strongest part of the Scotland
team.
''We must close them down if we are to win. We believe we will. That
is why we are here to prepare, because we want the players ready for a
match which is so important for our country.''
Despite his own team problems, Romantsev seems confident. He is
relaxed, enjoying the taste of luxury, and looking towards the return to
Moscow today with a buoyant, confident bunch of players.
But he does have some words of consolation for Craig Brown should the
game does go against the Scots.
Says Romantsev: ''It does not mean the end for Scotland if they lose.
You have to remember that this will be the last of their difficult away
fixtures.
''Greece, in comparison, have built up their points at home. Their
only away game has been against the Faroe Islands.
''The Greeks have looked good, but we must wait to see how they react
away from home.
''That is what is so important for Scotland right now. The Scots
finish with a run of matches in their own country and that could carry
them to the finals.
''The way the dates have been arranged could very well work in
Scotland's favour before qualification is decided.''

<HEADLINE>Rommel raid leader's VC goes up for sale</HEADLINE>

A VICTORIA Cross won in a Scottish commando's attempt to capture
Rommel on the eve of the Battle of El Alamein is to be sold in London
tomorrow.
The decoration was awarded posthumously to Lieutenant-Colonel Geoffrey
Keyes, 24, who died leading the raid.
Medallists Spink and Son expect the VC and other medals, including a
Military Cross awarded to Lt-Col Keyes, to fetch up to #90,000.
Lt-Col Keyes was the son of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Keyes, who sold
the medals some years ago to an American collector.
The bid to capture Rommel on 17 November, 1941, was thwarted by faulty
intelligence. When the commandos attacked, the German commander was 250
miles away and the target villa between Tobruk and Benghazi turned out
to be the headquarters of the German and Italian supply services, rather
than Rommel's residence.
The 11th Scottish Commando had sailed from Alexandria in two
submarines, approaching the coast behind German lines at night, but
their rubber boats capsized and only 30 officers and men got ashore.
After leading his detachment inland in torrential rain, Lt-Col Keyes
posted a guard to block the approach roads and was left with only one
officer and an NCO with whom to assault the villa.
They burst through the front door, firing tommy-guns and throwing
grenades, but Lt-Col Keyes was shot in the chest and died after being
carried outside by his companions.
All the party were killed or captured, apart from two men who trekked
through the Libyan desert to Egypt, surviving for two months behind
enemy lines.

THE BBC scooped the lion's share of the Lloyds Bank BAFTA craft awards
at a ceremony in Glasgow's King's Theatre last night.
It took eight of the 11 top production prizes, including awards for
its two major period dramas, Martin Chuzzlewit and Middlemarch. There
was also an award for BBC Scotland's comedy drama Takin' Over the Asylum
which won for Best Editing.
The only craft prize secured by ITV was Best Design for the two-part
drama Dandelion Dead.
During the ceremony, which was attended by the Princess Royal as
president of the British Academy, a special surprise award was presented
to Cilla Black for Blind Date.
On receiving her award, Cilla Black said she was ''chuffed'' and then
proceeded to bite the hand which feeds her by remarking: ''I would
really like to say a very big thank you to all the idiots who appear on
Blind Date. They are wonderful, wonderful people.''
The Princess Royal said it was very easy, in these days of information
technology, to take for granted all the people involved in producing
programmes. She described them as swans, graceful on the top, but
''paddling like hell'' underneath.
''This ceremony, these production awards, will always be important.
There are always going to be people paddling like hell underneath on the
night, on the day, on the screen. They set an example for everyone,''
she said.
Liverpool playwright Jimmy McGovern appropriately thanked his ''Ma''
on Mother's Day when he was presented with the prestigious Dennis Potter
Award for his contribution to television drama. McGovern, creator of
Cracker, received his prize from the programme's star, Robbie Coltrane.
Other special awards went to Desmond Lynam (How did he do that?) in
honour of his years of presenting sports and factual programmes, and to
ITN to mark the news service's 40th birthday.
In the film craft awards Four Weddings and a Funeral was conspicuous
by its absence. Indeed, only one film, Backbeat, could truly be
described as British. Other film production awards went to American
films Speed and Forrest Gump.
Among the stars who presented prizes at last night's show were Ian
Bannen, Annette Crosbie, Blythe Duff, Ally McCoist, and Alan Yentob,
controller of BBC1.
Four Weddings and a Funeral even failed to make it into the
entertainment side of the event. Wet Wet Wet performed their latest
single, Julia Says, and not the familiar theme tune to the film.
It was also announced last night that the Post Office has awarded,
through BAFTA, a #15,000 scholarship to a young film maker whose
ambition is to build on Britain's rich documentary tradition, a field of
visual excellence in which the Post Office has long played a leading
role.
The full list of winners was:
Awards in the gift of council -- Special Award -- ITN; The Michael
Balcon Award (for outstanding British contribution to cinema) -- Ridley
and Tony Scott; The Alan Clarke Award (for outstanding creative
contribution to television) -- Edward Mirzoeff; The Dennis Potter award
-- Jimmy McGovern; The Richard Dimbleby award (for the year's most
important personal contribution on screen in factual televison) --
Desmond Lynam; the Lou Grade award (for significant and popular
programmes) -- Blind Date; the foreign television award -- NYPD Blue.
Film Awards. The Anthony Asquith award (for achievement in film music)
-- Backbeat, Don Was; Best Cinematography -- Interview With The Vampire,
Philippe Rousselot; Best Production Design -- Interview With The
Vampire, Dante Ferretti; Best Costume Design -- The Adventures Of
Priscilla, Lizzy Gardiner and Tim Chappel; Best Editing -- Speed, John
Wright; Best Sound -- Speed, Stephen Hunter Flick, Gregg Landaker, Steve
Maxlow, Bob Beemer, David MacMillan; Best Achievement in Special Effects
-- Forrest Gump, Ken Ralston, George Murphy, Stephen Rosenbaum, Doug
Chiang; Best Make-up/Hair -- The Adventures Of Priscilla, Cassie Hanlon,
Angela Conte, Strykermeyer.
Television awards. Best original television music -- Middlemarch,
Stanley Myers and Christopher Gunning; Best Make-up -- Middlemarch,
Deanne Turner; Best Photography (factual) -- Beyond The Clouds, Phil
Agland; Best Photography and Lighting (fiction and entertainment) --
Family, Daf Hobson; Best Costume Design -- The Day To Day, Richard
Norley and Russell Hilliard; Best Sound (factual) -- Torvill and Dean:
Facing The Music, David Welsh, Paul Hardy and Keith Marriner; Best Sound
(fiction entertainment) -- Family, Kieran Horgan, Rupert Miles, David
Old and Paul Conway; Best Editing (factual) -- The Club (Cutting Edge),

MORE than 1000 people packed St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh
yesterday for a Mass to mark the appointment of Cardinal Thomas Winning
to the College of Cardinals -- a belated celebration which was to have
taken place around Christmas, but Cardinal Winning had to call off
because of illness. During the Mass, the cardinal called on people to
base their moral conduct on sound and objective values.
Before the service, Cardinal Winning attended a lunch held in his
honour by Lord Provost Norman Irons of Edinburgh in the city chambers.
The two men are pictured above having a pre-prandial chat.
Later, Lothian Regional Council convener Councillor Eric Milligan
hosted a reception for the cardinal, during which he was praised for his
work in highlighting poverty.

THE Football Association hinted yesterday that it might ban England
matches abroad unless the team is accompanied by Scotland Yard
detectives who would be able to identify troublemakers.
The move follows the violence at the England-Ireland international in
Dublin last month which resulted in the match being abandoned.
''If we can't export our own intelligence with us and have our own
intelligence officers on site where we are playing then it would not be
sensible to go to that event and play,'' said the FA spokesman.
England's next away fixture is October's match against Norway.
The spokesman said arrangements were already being made to use British
intelligence in that event and prevent a repeat hooligan outrage.
He said the intelligence officers would be police officers attached to
the National Criminal Intelligence Service which is part of Scotland
Yard.

CHURCH of Scotland elders are likely to be asked to play a bigger role
in church affairs to help stave off the Kirk's cash crisis.
They may be invited to take church services in a bid to help parishes
throughout Scotland make ends meet.
Their increased role would come about because the Kirk is running out
of cash to pay for full-time ministers.
Details of the cash problems are detailed in a report to be discussed
by the General Assembly in May.
It shows that around 300 of the 1300 parishes in Scotland are unable
to support a minister through contributions given in their own churches.
The Church of Scotland cash reserves which help subsidise the poorer
churches are falling and there are fears many may lose their full-time
minister.
Some ministers may be allowed to take part-time jobs as the Kirk finds
it increasingly difficult to pay their stipend, which is a minimum of
#14,844 and a manse.
Even a likely move by the Kirk to re-jig its budget, allowing an extra
#400,000 each year to be released to the ministry from 1997, would leave
it short of cash.
The Rev Sandy McDonald, general secretary of the Church of Scotland's
Board of Ministry, said that using elders to take services was a way
which had been mentioned to help the cash problems the church has.
He said: ''There is growing interest in using elders even more in
church affairs. They help at communion and visiting and there is no
reason for not exploring the possibility of using them to take services.
''At present, elders do an excellent job and would be perfectly
capable of playing an increased role.
''For instance, it could be suggested that one minister could have
overall control of several rural churches and elders would take the
services in the churches. The minister would liaise with the elders in
each church.
''Some elders who have the time to take training may want even to
become auxilliary ministers.
''There has been talk of such a move and that is one way forward for
us.
''The report to the General Assembly makes it clear the financial
difficulties we are facing and we must investigate all possibilities.''
A Church of Scotland spokesman said new patterns of ministry which
might help to meet the needs of the Scottish people should be closely
examined as a matter of urgency.

THINGS have changed at Hampden Park; quite a lot. The last time I was
there it was a pile of legendary mud and the terraces were coursed by
lager and piss from so-called fans.
It is amazingly different now. Today it is the National Stadium and
looks absolutely wonderful with more to come. Stadium Director Austin
Reilly tells me a little of what is happening. The 33 acres of the
estate will receive considerable finances through the National Lottery,
and the Millennium will pay for the extraordinary ambitions of what is a
unique club in world football.
For Queen's Park, the Spiders, the only club in the world which
actually insists that their players sport their jerseys outside their
shorts (and until the early 60s made their performers play in white
gloves), also are the only club in professional sport which insists that
nobody gets paid. For Queen's Park are entirely amateur. Corinthian to a
man. Even to a coach.
Where else the manager is a manager, and full of himself, the Spiders
yet have a coach. For many years it was Eddie Hunter, a lovely man whose
demotic was blue-er than an alternative comic's, and now it is rather a
mild-mannered chap, Hugh McCann. Eddie was more than 30 years with the
club and his own son is yet the assistant, but Hugh is now the main man
and a quiet fellow. He has done well over the past few weeks though
Saturday saw a defeat.
But I was not at Hampden to witness Queen's at all: I was there to
watch their striker, a rather charismatic young man called Brian McPhee.
He has been the object of attention from a lot of premier and English
clubs and, indeed, Rangers and Arsenal had people there at the weekend.
They must have been impressed by what they saw.
Brian is a bit older tham one expects from a young hopeful. He is 24.
Spent a lot of time away from the game, occasionally knocking goals in
for Glencairn Thistle -- he was top scorer for three years for the
Ru'glen club -- and had a spectacular start for Queen's at the beginning
of last season when he was scoring every game.
There is something absurd about Scottish football when it allows a
talent, such as McPhee has, to mess around for a few years and then
doesn't pick it up later. I knew about McPhee because everybody was
talking about him. He is the fastest player I have seen since Gento. He
has legs on him like Billy Whizz, and Jimmy of the Magic Patch . . .
enough of the Dundonian comic characters: but there is a touch of Roy of
The Rovers in Brian.
He scored, of course, a lovely header at the near post.
Queen's are not doing very well at the moment and Arbroath, under the
management of John Brogan, have been winning well. I am told that Mr
Brogan is a very nice fellow, but his behaviour at Hampden on Saturday
belied that reputation. He harangued his players and the referee,
(George Clyde, a lovely man I last met reffing kids' footy in George
Square), and when his team won by a penalty in virtually the last kick
(sic) of the game he stood in front of the rather gentlemanly Queen's
support and gave a dance of triumph which would have done credit to
Chief Cetawayo, but with less dignity.
As for dignity, young McPhee, who had been subbed in the last five
minutes, well, he behaved with it. He scored, he played, he showed all
of his class. He watched the last-minute score which meant defeat and
strode off the park like a seasoned professional, and class was there.
At the end of the tunnel, just before the dressing room he gave vent
to his feelings with a wee sweary word. Naebody could blame him. Queen's
director Martin Smith, The Herald lawyer in fact -- a sheer coincidence,
I can assure you -- says: ''There goes the Shadow, The Prince of
Darkness.'' It is McPhee's nickname.
Nicknames go with popularity as a splendid short story by Scott
Fitzgerald might remind you, and McPhee is popular. He turns up
immaculate in his blazer and flannels, the other lads know he's a
player, an odd thing at the short end of football where old lags will
play alongside mere boys.
In a week when football has had its saddest moments it's grand to see
fun and splendour. If there is a weakness in Brian, said everybody I
spoke to -- from the legendary Davie Letham of Queen's, to coach McCann,
to fans and ballboys -- it is that Brian is ''a wee bit temperamental.''
Ach, maybe he is. Fast, though. Tricky. A goalscorer, the genuine
article. I am trying to think of temperamental. Baxter, Johnstone, Best,
Puskas; so were they all temperamental. Brian might not be one of them.
But he's a player. Remember the name. Remember, I told you first.

I WATCHED, as did a large proportion of the population, the recent
Grand Slam encounter between Scotland and England, followed by the quite
ludicrous remarks made by Brian Moore which have attracted a great deal
of criticism from all aspects of the media.
The remarks themselves I do not consider worthy of further comment,
but once my initial ire had passed, I started to consider whether
remarks of this nature might not be worthy of some form of sanction from
the English Rugby Union.
We have all watched with dismay the antics of the various participants
of the ''round ball'' game and the subsequent charges of ''bringing the
game into disrepute'' which have ensued.
I would contend that Mr Moore's comments were far more than a purile
and ill-mannered outburst, but could easily have incited violence among
the supporting millions. If it is intended that rugby adheres to a
strict code of discipline, as is necessary in such a physical contact
sport, I do not consider that the post-match remarks can merely be
disregarded as a ''spur-of-the-moment'' emotion.
May I congratulate the managment and players of both teams in the way
in which they diplomatically sought to defuse a particularly
controversial situation. I would welcome any comments.

Not even
Mars bar
on tartan
I HAVE today written to Brian Moore, c/o Twickenham, to thank him for
two things.
1. Hastening the day when all British Lions tours will be scrapped,
thus ensuring all our efforts will be focused in Scotland. (What Scot
would want to play beside that arrogant little sod?)
2. Ensuring that, even if England were playing men from the planet
Mars, that tartan scarves would be raised for the men from outer space.

BRIAN Moore's remarks, following England's victory over Scotland,
probably dismayed most English rugby supporters as much as they
disgusted Scottish supporters.
John Jeffrey's condemnation of them as 'despicable' is perhaps the
best comment. However, a more serious feature of the incident has been
the silence of the English Rugby Union. The least one might have
expected, if they were not prepared to discipline Moore for ''bringing
the game into disrepute,'' would have been that they would publicly
disassociate themselves from his remarks and make it plain that he spoke
only for himself.

Sign of
integrity
must still
be first
THE article by Brian Meek in The Herald on golf's disqualification
rule for signing an incorrect card, like most of Brian's articles, is
entertaining but completely misses the point.
The scorecard is a document containing information which the
competitor signs as being correct and, as is the case with all
documents, if signed with wrong information becomes void, resulting in
the disqualification of the competitor.
I am sure Brian would get the point if he signed an insurance policy
or his expenses claim which contained wrong information and the error
was found out at a later date.
While agreeing with him that it is a severe penalty for
''carelessness,'' the value and integrity of a signature must be
preserved.
His other point, that professionals should have their score recorded
independently by the authorities, is another nonsense. They play the
same game as we hackers do and should be subject to the same rules and
restrictions.
In the monthly medal, we do not have scoreboards or ''dolly birds''
keeping our score, only a confused marker asking if it was ''really a
7?'' The professionals get enough advantage in this game without being
accorded more.
I hope when Brian plays his next game, the match secretary gets as
much amusement from reading his scorecard as I got from his article.

It's not
all right,
Jack
JACK McLean is normally in such good form after his weekend sojourns
at various sporting events and clubhouses, no doubt enjoying a libation
purely to quench his parched mouth.
Unfortunately, he did himself no justice while describing the state of
rugby in the South-Side of Glasgow during his Grand Slam afternoon spent
in that ''hotbed'' of Glasgow rugby -- Allan Glen's!
If Jack cares to glance at the McEwan's National League, Division 3,
he will see Clarkston RFC have secured a vital spot in next season's new
Premier Division set-up. Many of the so-called rebels have enjoyed a
great first season at Clarkston.
Hutchesons'/Aloysians, on the other hand, seem destined to fade into
obscurity. What a tragedy for the rugby potential in the south-side of
Glasgow.
Jack, it was not a ''shameful exit'' (Herald Sport 20/3/95) last
summer but a step forward by a number of young men wanting a better
coaching set-up, improved playing facilities and opportunities, and a
superb social set-up.
Come and watch the World Cup final at Braidholm, Jack.

There's

bias. . .
I WAS surprised and disappointed at the poor cover coverage in the
Scottish Press of Scotland's fifth successive win in the national
bowling internationals held at Nottingham this year.
Every paper had pages of praise for a losing Scots rugby team. Surely
bowlers must greatly outnumber rugby supporters, and deserve a bias in
their favour for a change. Can you name any other sport where we
consistently beat England, Ireland, and Wales?

Another
legend
is lost
I WAS interested to read Ian Paul's View on Friday, March 17 in which
he writes that the most revered game ever played in Scotland was the
Real Madrid-Eintracht European Cup final at Hampden in 1960.
However, I was most saddened to read in The Herald the same week of
the death of Jack Mowat, the match referee that night, and whose
contribution to the event put him among the great referees in the game,
and certainly never to be forgotten by all of us lucky enough to have
been there.

<HEADLINE>Water repairs delay swelling profits, Panorama claims</HEADLINE>

WATER companies have boosted their profits from hundreds of millions
of pounds left unspent despite being intended for sewer repairs and
other renewal work, industry experts claim today.
Customers' bills were increased to meet the urgent need for renovation
of sewers, pipes, and other installations, but the capital spending was
then delayed, according to BBC1's Panorama.
The programme also adds to controversy about top people's pay and
perks in privatised industries by claiming that 25 water company
directors have made about #4m ''paper profit'' between them on share
options.
Panorama claims that, of #773m raised from customers' bills to meet
renewal needs, the spending of #217m has been deferred and some of it
''has found its way into company profit and loss accounts''.
Pollution consultant Mike Matthews, a former National Rivers Authority
inspector, said: ''The basic aim of the game, under the current rules,
is you price high, build cheap and pocket the difference.
''The capital programme, the amount being spent on new works, is
actually going down every year. And yet the turnover from customers'
bills is actually going up.
''Schemes have been delayed, schemes are being allowed to drift from
one year to the next, and the upshot is, if you delay your capital
expenditure you increase your profits within any given year.''
According to Norman Walker, of the sewer firm Instituform Permaline,
contractors were going out of business or making people redundant
because the expected boom in work had not materialised.
He believed the cutback by water companies was ''basically to enhance
their balance sheets, their accounts, their profit figures, and to keep
the share value up. It's a help in the City''.
But Mr Colin Skellet, Wessex Water's managing director and a spokesman
for the industry, said spending on sewer renovation was about to rise
after an initial delay because of changed priorities, including the need
to tackle sewer flooding and pollution.
Mr Michael Hoffman, Thames Water chief executive, said: ''It's not a
massive piece of trickery.''
Regulators Ofwat had judged that the company should spent #2100m over
five years on infrastructure improvements, but he aimed to do the same
amount of work for #1750m by increased efficiency.
''We haven't spent less yet. I've explained that, when we spend less,
then we'll make a judgment on how we split them (the savings).''
The programme says analysis of material in the House of Commons
Library shows the level of profit potentially available to water company
directors with share options, if they were to sell at current prices.
Panorama claims the following paper profits:
* Mr David Cranston, chief executive of Northumbrian Water, #413,000.
* Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive of Severn Trent, #358,000.
* Mr Vic Cocker, a director of Severn Trent, #200,000.
* Sir Gordon Jones, chairman of Yorkshire Water, #127,000.
Mr Cocker told Panorama: ''Anybody running one of these businesses has
to have regard not to his personal financial circumstances but largely
to the interests of investors more generally.
''And, in taking into account the interests of investors, one has to
take into account the interests of the customers.''

SCOTLAND'S thousands of bank workers plan to fight the abolition of a
traditional New Year holiday.
A decision by Scottish clearing bank bosses to open on January 2 from
1997 has provoked an outcry among staff.
However, it emerged yesterday that the controversial move to bring
Scotland's four main banks into line with their English counterparts
will be strongly resisted by finance union BIFU.
Executives of the union decided over the weekend to launch a campaign
at next month's STUC conference. They will also demand the backing of
Scotland's MPs. A challenge to the legality of the move will also be
explored.
Bank chiefs intend to replace the January 2 day off with Easter Monday
and also switch the first Monday in August holiday with the English
Monday holiday at the end of the month.
Sandy Boyle, BIFU's deputy general secretary (Scotland), said last
night: ''A lot of our members actually work and live away from their
families and travel home during the traditional New Year break.
''January 2 has become a traditional Scottish holiday. Scrapping it
would mean many of our members without their own transport being unable
to travel to see their families.
''We believe we'll get the support of the banks' customers who are
also on holiday. There's no real need for banks on January 2 -- the
whole thing's a complete nonsense.
''Most of the outcry has been over the loss of January 2 but many are
upset about the loss of the August Monday which falls during the
Scottish school holidays.''
BIFU Scottish vice-president Jim Williams said: ''If you take away the
January 2 holiday people will be unable to join their families for the
first.''
The banks claim bringing holidays into line with English arrangements
will end a great deal of confusion and inconvenience for customers,
particularly business clients.
A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland said: ''We are in the same
situation as the other Scottish clearing banks who have agreed
collectively that we want to bring the bank holidays we operate into
line with the rest of the financial sector -- building societies,
insurance companies and other financial institutions -- who already open
on January 2.''
He added that the different holidays ''across the border'' caused
significent problems for business customers concluding Stock Exchange
settlements and other financial deals on Scottish bank holidays.

THE value of major public works projects in Scotland which could be
financed by the private sector has risen to #2700m, the Scottish Office
announced yesterday.
In the past six months, nine projects worth #800m have been added to
the list of schemes which could go ahead under the Government's Private
Finance Initiative.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said the public and private sectors were
working together to develop innovative ways of bringing forward projects
sooner than would otherwise have been possible.
By far the biggest recent addition to the list is the #500m scheme
proposed by Glasgow District Council, under which it would work with a
private partner to improve heating and insulation standards in the
authority's houses.
Other new plans are mostly in the health sector, notably a #150m
replacement for Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Basic details are given of a
privately-financed prison, but no cost has been put on it.
Proposals previously included in the initiative list are the second
Forth Road Bridge (#350m), the M6 completion (#120m), a link road
between the Kincardine Bridge and the M90 (#120m), and a large number of
water and sewerage projects.
Mr Lang said: ''I see considerable scope for the scale of private
sector investment in public infrastructure to grow still further.
''The Scottish business and financial sectors have been quick to see
the benefits of PFI and I hope that they can maximise the potential
rewards it offers to Scottish companies and the economy in general.''
A new booklet, explaining the initiative, is published today by the
Scottish Office.

DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind admitted Mr Major could face a
challenge to his leadership this year.
It was the first time a senior Cabinet Minister had publicly accepted
this possibility, but senior Cabinet and Tory party figures said the
Prime Minister would survive any leadership challenge this autumn.
Mr Rifkind himself rejected the idea of his losing. He said there was
always the possibility that ''some very foolish individual back
bencher'' might stand against Mr Major but he would not expect the
contest to be ''significant''.
Suggestions that Mr Major would be deposed were ''a lot of bunkum'',
said Mr Rifkind, who declared: ''We are more likely to win under John
Major than under anybody else.''
The former Chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, often seen as a possible
challenger, appeared to rule himself out in a Sky News interview. He
said: ''The idea that when a government is in trouble you just change
the leader and everything is changed is, frankly, nonsense.''
Mr David Hunt, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said: ''It's not
going to happen. We have got a Prime Minister who is leading from the
front and who is setting the agenda.''
Mr Major hopes to do that in a speech next Saturday to the
Conservative Central Council in Birmingham when he is expected to cast
doubts on Labour leader Tony Blair's ability to deliver some of the
policies he is outlining.
The same theme was developed by Mr Rifkind who said in a BBC Radio
Four World This Weekend interview, that he had no problem if Mr Blair
wanted to present himself as ''a born-again Conservative''. But the
Labour leader was not as likely to be able to deliver Conservative
policies as a Conservative government.
The Prime Minister's position was strengthened by the findings of a
Mori Poll for the Sunday Times, suggesting that if Board of Trade
President Michael Heseltine took over as Tory leader the party would
gain only 3% and remain 31% behind Labour instead of 34% under Mr Major.
Tory prospects would actually worsen with other possible new leaders
from the Cabinet, with Labour 39% ahead against Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke, and 36% against Employment Secretary Michael Portillo.
Expected heavy Conservative losses in the Scottish and English local
government elections in April and May could put pressure on Mr Major.
However, his victory in the last General Election was against all
forecasts and he believes he can do the same again.
There is a band of irreconcilable Tory MPs who want him out, one of
whom, Mr John Carlisle (Luton North), has already said he was willing to
be a ''stalking horse'' candidate to test opinion in the parliamentary
party.
He said that three of the first four questions at his local party
annual general meeting were about the Prime Minister's position. Mr
Carlisle said a leadership election would clear the air enabling the
party to rally behind either the present leader or a new one.
There is doubt, however, whether 32 Tory MPs could be found to
nominate publicly a challenger as required under the revised rules for
the leadership contest.
Sir Antony Mayer, the former Tory MP whose ''forlorn hope'' challenge
in 1989 first revealed the weakness of Mrs Thatcher's position, pointed
out that then he required only two sponsors, whose names were not
published.
Viscount Whitelaw, the elder statesman of the party, whose reported
criticisms of the Government as ''an absolute shower'' and ''weakly
led'' dismayed the faithful, said he was ''totally against'' any
leadership change. He did not specifically repudiate the words
attributed to him, commenting: ''If you talk to a friend you sometimes
say this and that.''
He added that he believed Mr Major would take the party into the next
election and that he deserved the help of all his colleagues.
An influential senior Tory back bencher, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, said it
would be a ''grave error'' if leading party figures -- the men in grey
suits -- asked the Prime Minister to step down after bad local election
results.
''I don't believe a change would improve matters,'' said Sir Nicholas.
''It would cause a great deal of friction within the party as Mr
Heseltine and Mr Clarke have a much more federalist agenda for Europe
than the Prime Minister does himself.''

UEFA are considering plans to expand the format of the Champions

the number of clubs would be doubled to 32.
Europe's ruling body would also have the right to allocate places in
the premier club event on a wild-card basis to fill the quota.
The need for change to what is a highly successful competition became
apparent during this month's quarter-finals. Of the eight teams
competing at that stage, only one, Ajax, is certain to qualify for next
season's CL.
The other seven -- AC Milan, Bayern Munich, IFK Gothenburg, Benfica,
Hajduk Split, Paris St Germain, and Barcelona -- are all struggling, or
are out of contention, in their domestic leagues.
UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner said: ''This is the most
prestigious club event in the world and it would be a great loss to
football if supporters were deprived of seeing the biggest names compete
in the best league.
''We want to avoid a dramatic exit of most of the top clubs from the
competition and are considering giving wild cards to ensure that this
does not happen.''
Aigner added that these exemptions would be granted to clubs with the
best records in European competition over the past five years.
UEFA will also introduce three points for a win in the CL next season.
Teams who draw ties must hand back #175,000 of their bonus money.
This will be placed in a fund to be dispensed at end of the
competition on a sliding scale based on the goal-scoring records of each
club. This, UEFA believe, will be another incentive for attacking
football.
Louis van Gaal, coach of Ajax, reacted: ''It is a fair and honest
consideration by UEFA.''
The wider perception will certainly view these latest changes as
significant in bringing a European League closer to reality.
* FORMER Dutch captain Ronald Koeman, who yesterday signed a contract
to join FC Groningen, where he launched his career, left no doubt that
he cannot stand the turmoil at Barcelona any longer.
Koeman, whose brother Erwin plays with Groningen and whose father,
Martin, is the chief executive there, was scathing in his criticism of
both his errant Barcelona team-mate Hristo Stoichkov and coach Johan
Cruyff.
He said: ''Every year there is some sort of crisis at the Nou Camp but
I have never known the situation to be so serious as it is now.
''Stoichkov's remarks reflected very badly on the squad. He said we
were not good enough to play with him and , frankly, we are all sick and
tired of his antics and the trouble he has caused.
''The changes Cruyff made this season have not worked out and he has
not been able to replace Michael Laudrup.
''I am still angry and upset at his tactics against Paris St Germain
in Paris which cost us our place in the Champions League.
''I have had six difficult years in Spain and now I want to go home.
''My example is Frank Rijkaard. He made the same decision to leave AC
Milan and I look and envy how he is enjoying himself with Ajax.
''This is what I intend to do at Groningen for the next year, then I
will reconsider my future.''
Despite his reputation, there is no shortage of interest in Stoichkov.
Bayern Munich have made an approach for him in the past week and also
for Paris St Germain striker George Weah.
But both are wanted in Italy where Internazionale are prepared to pay
#4m for the Bulgarian and AC Milan believe Weah can fill the void left
by the continuing injury to Marco van Basten.
* SPARTA Rotterdam's dismissal of coach Han Berger is the twelfth
managerial change this season in the 18-club Dutch first division.

THERE are disadvantages as well as benefits to hosting the final
stages of a major international tournament, and two years' worth of
friendly matches against moderate opposition, in which the result barely
matters, is high among them.
It is certainly hard to summon up much enthusiasm for England's
seventh successive home game under Terry Venables on Wednesday, against
a Uruguayan side that failed to qualify for the World Cup finals and
contains perhaps one player -- Rueben Sosa -- that the fan in the street
has ever heard of. The great English public appear to feel the same way
and it is unlikely that even the 37,000 who turned out to watch Nigeria
last November will return.
There should, of course, have been a considerably more interesting
fixture in the meantime, but last month's game in Dublin, supposed to be
Venables' first away from home, has now been officially scrubbed from
the records.
England, perversely, had decided to award caps for the 27 minutes
played before their shock troops got the match called off, despite not
counting the result (which would have been a 1-0 defeat). FIFA have now
pointed out to them the illogicality of such a position, and Wimbledon's
Warren Barton, who was making his debut at right back, therefore remains
an uncapped player.
To be fair, the appalling scenes in Ireland underlined part of the
FA's difficulty in putting together a testing, as well as attractive,
fixture list. It has been hard enough finding countries not playing
European Championship matches on days like Wednesday, when the huge list
of games illustrates the problem. In addition the number of countries
that would actually welcome the baggage that comes with a visit from
England's football team limits the choice even further.
Did someone say Scotland? Interestingly, Venables chose to endorse the
idea most heartily at the weekend. ''I've spoken to Craig Brown about it
and he's very keen,'' the English coach insisted. ''It was always one of
the best fixtures in the calendar. It's just a matter of making sure the
behaviour was fine, and I'm sure England and Scotland fans would make
sure it was.'' Realistic, or just the opposite?
Whatever, that is all for the future. On Wednesday, minus those
players injured, like Alan Shearer; turfed out -- Matt Le Tissier;
appealing against a prison sentence (Dennis Wise); or merely facing
trial -- Paul Ince -- England must try to conjure up some sort of
continuity from last autumn.
One way of doing that, as well as boosting the crowd, would be to play
Andy Cole for the first time, alongside his former Newcastle team-mates
Peter Beardsley and Robert Lee. Cole was hurriedly sent for when Shearer
withdrew last Thursday and, while nowhere as near as complete a player,
must be looked at soon.
Despite the low-key nature of Wednesday's match, no Premiership games
were scheduled this weekend. The leading Endsleigh League clubs did not
make the most of their hour in the spotlight, with a series of dour
fixtures.
Of the principal contenders, Wolves shrugged off their 4-1 FA Cup
defeat at home to Crystal Palace by beating Burnley 2-0, Tranmere failed
away from home again -- 2-1 at Millwall -- and Bolton missed their
chance to take the lead on Saturday with a 1-1 draw at Portsmouth.
Bolton, whose cup exploits over the past two season have brought
widespread appreciation, would be the popular choice for the one
automatic promotion place. This week, however, they face another
distraction with the Coca-Cola Cup final at Wembley against Liverpool.
Yesterday Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough took a four-point lead thanks
to a 3-0 home defeat of lowly Port Vale, with player-manager Bryan
Robson scoring his first goal of the season, maintaining his record of
scoring in every season of his 22-year career.

TWO Ayrshire MPs have called for urgent upgrading of more of
''Scotland's most dangerous road'' to motorway after four people died in
a head-on crash at the weekend.
They advised the Pollok Park motorway protesters to ''pack up their
tents'' and go.
Two couples died when their cars collided on the A77 Glasgow-Ayr road
in torrential rain near Newton Mearns on Saturday shortly after 3pm,
bringing the total killed on the Glasgow-Stranraer stretch of the road
to 43 in five years.
Labour MPs George Foulkes and Brian Donohoe said the tragedy
highlighted the need to upgrade the A77, the main link between Ayrshire
and Glasgow, and the focal point of Scotland's fiercest environmental
controversy.
The construction of a six-mile motorway extension through Glasgow has
led to angry clashes between protesters and tree-felling squads on the
proposed route of the motorway through Pollok in the south of the city.
While the MPs have supported the #53.6m six-mile extension, they also
urged yesterday that plans for a 10-mile motorway upgrading of the A77
between Malletsheugh and Fenwick should be put in place as quickly as
possible.
The victims of Saturday's crash were named yesterday as Mr Railton
''Ray'' Morris, 72, his wife Margaret, 75, of Lochaline Drive, Cathcart,
Glasgow, Mr Steven Christie, 25, and Ms Sandra Cochrane, 26, of Haining
Avenue, Kilmarnock. Mr Morris was an elder at Cathcart South Church.
Police said Mr Christie apparently lost control of his Volvo 340 near
Drumboy Farm, Fenwick, causing it to cross over the north-bound
carriageway and collide with the Skoda driven by Mr Morris. Both couples
are understood to have died instantly.
Mr Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, argued that the
most serious accidents occurred on the stretch which consists mainly of
four-lane trunk roads with no central barrier.
He said that the Scottish Office timetable meant that the 10-mile
motorway upgrading would probably not be completed for at least another
four years.
The MP said: ''Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has admitted that the A77
is the most dangerous road in Scotland. He has also said that building
the M77 extension will save 3700 casualties over the next 30 years.
''I am certain that upgrading the Malletsheugh link to Fenwick will
save even more casualties. We must not waste time in building this
road.''
Mr Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, claimed that much of the
road network in north Ayrshire, was ''a death trap''. He said drivers
would be more inclined to use the A77 if it was brought up to a
reasonable standard.
Both MPs renewed their appeals to the anti-M77 campaigners to call off
their protests in the light of Saturday's tragedy. Mr Foulkes declared:
''If the protesters at Pollok Park have any conscience at all, they will
pack up their tents today and leave.'' Mr Donohoe added: ''It is
difficult to see how they justify saving trees at the cost of human
lives.''
However, Mr Craig Beaton, chairman of a local residents' group in
Pollok protesting against the M77, said: ''The accident is unfortunate.
Our sympathies go out to the families of those involved.
''But the construction of a motorway does not mean that the bad
accidents are going to be prevented.''
Meanwhile, relatives and friends of the victims of Saturday's crash
were yesterday coming to terms with their deaths.
Neighbours and acquaintances described Mr and Mrs Morris as ''the most
devoted couple'' you could ever meet. Prayers were said for the family
of the dead couple at Cathcart South Church.
Mrs Christine Reid, 49, who lived across the road from them in
Cathcart's Braehead estate, said: ''I have never met such a devoted
couple. Ray was always there for all of us. He was one of life's
gentlemen.''
0 The couple's only daughter, Sandra, 42, had been with a friend on a
trip in London for the weekend to watch a show. She learned of her
parents' deaths late on Saturday and flew home yesterday.
Her husband, Mr Angus Mackinnon, said his wife and the couple's three
children, Graeme, 19, Joanne, 18, and Aileen, 13, were stunned by the
tragedy.
The other victims, Mr Steven Christie, a self-employed joiner, and Ms
Sandra Cochrane, met over a year ago. Ms Cochrane, who recently
divorced, had two sons, Jamie, 7 and Jason, 4.
Ms Cochrane's parents were ''too distraught'' to speak at their home
in Cambuslang yesterday. Her father, Jack, is a community officer with
Strathclyde police.
One of Mr Christie's brothers, Sandy, 28, said the whole family was
devastated.

AJAX Amsterdam stretched their unbeaten league run this season to 26
matches with a 1-0 victory yesterday over Twente Enschede.
A goal by Nigerian striker Nwankwo Kanu maintained Ajax's four-point
lead over Roda JC Kerkrade, 2-1 winners at Feyenoord Rotterdam.
Ajax were never posed any real problems by Twente but failed to
convert their superiority into goals, Finnish striker Jari Litmanen and
Dutch internationalist Ronald de Boer both missing excellent chances in
the first half.
Kanu's strike came after 16 minutes when he fired home a cross from
international winger Marc Overmars.
Feyenoord, missing six key players, struggled to find any rhythm and
went behind after 24 minutes when Maurice Graeff netted after some good
work by midfielder Barry van Galen.
Graeff scored his second two minutes before half-time after Arno
Doomernik set him up with an easy chance.
Feyenoord pulled a goal back 10 minutes into the second half when
Giovanni van Bronckhorst was brought down in the penalty box by Johan de
Kock. Goalkeeper Ruud Hesp saved Ruud Heus' spot-kick but Brazilian
midfielder Glaucio crashed home the rebound.

ITALY head for a key European championship qualifying match against
Ukraine in Kiev on Wednesday in an uneasy frame of mind after a 4-1 win
over Estonia failed to silence their critics.
The Italians struggled until Gianfranco Zola put them ahead just on
half-time with his first international goal.
Milan midfield player Demetrio Albertini, Zola, and debutant striker
Fabrizio Ravanelli netted again for Italy in the second half.
Estonia scored their first goal of the qualifiers through substitute
Martin Reim after 72 minutes.
Croatia's 4-0 hammering of Ukraine in Zagreb on Saturday reinforced
their position at the head of the group.
Croatia have a maximum 12 points, followed by Italy with seven points,
while Lithuania are third on six but with a game in hand. Ukraine have
four points from four games.
Second place in the group should be enough to take Italy, who did not
qualify for the 1992 tournament, to the finals in England next year.
The six second-placed teams with the best records qualify directly
while the remaining two group runners-up meet in a play-off for the last
spot.
Parma striker Zola, winning his eleventh cap, was the undoubted star,
his individual skill injecting some life into Italy's sometimes
ponderous approach play.
Zola owed his place to the absence from the squad of Roberto Baggio,
still short of peak fitness and form after a long injury lay-off.
Sacchi promised changes to his line-up for Wednesday's game but would
not be drawn on details.
* PAUL le Guen, of Paris St Germain, will take over from Eric Cantona
as France's captain for their European championship match against Israel
in Tel Aviv on Wednesday.
Team manager Aime Jacquet stripped Cantona of the captaincy and
dropped him from the team until the end of the season following the
Manchester United player's assault on a spectator in a Premiership match
against Crystal Palace in January.
Cantona has been suspended by his club until the end of the season and
by the English Football Association until the end of September following
the incident.
He is currently appealing against a two-week prison sentence imposed
last week.
Le Guen captained French champions PSG from 1992 to 1994. He will earn
his sixteenth cap in Israel.
France rely on Nantes pair Patrice Loko and Nicolas Ouedec in attack,
leaving David Ginola, who helped PSG knock out Barcelona in the European
Cup quarter-finals, on the substitutes' bench.
* SOUTH Africa are ready to host next year's African Nations' Cup
finals, the continent's top football official said yesterday.
Confederation of African Football president Issa Hayatou completed a
week-long inspection tour of the venues for next January's event which
will involve 16 teams.
South Africa stepped in as hosts tournament after Kenya withdrew last
November.

POLICE are investigating the discovery of a loaded automatic pistol
carefully hidden in the ground near a disused railway line. It was found
by four boys, who said the police told them they believe it was left
there on purpose.
The pistol, a .38 calibre, was buried in woods on the edge of a
railway line near Stoneyburn, West Lothian.
One of the boys, James Logan, 15, of Redcroft Place, Stoneyburn said:
''It was well hidden and we came across it by pure luck.
''We were taking a short-cut from Stoneyburn to Whitburn and were
mucking about in the trees when we dislodged a board and saw something
underneath it. We looked closely and saw ground had been dug up.''
They examined further and found ''a black chemical container with a
screw-top lid and a rubber seal to keep the rain out. When we opened it
up there was a pistol with bullets in it, wrapped in a dishcloth.
''We took it immediately to the police who told us they thought it had
been left there deliberately, maybe even for someone else to pick up.''
His mother, Marie, said: ''The police said they thought it had been
left there on purpose.
''There was a tree near-by which could have been used as a marker for
anyone coming along to pick the pistol up on instructions.''
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders police last night confirmed the
pistol had been found on Wednesday afternoon and inquiries were
continuing.

THE East region could be on course for its first Scottish Cup success
in 11 years.
Camelon's 4-1 defeat of the Kilwinning Rangers at Carmuirs Park now
gives the East two sides in the last four following Whitburn's 1-0
success last week at Tayport.
Camelon, in fact, are now joint favourites with Glenafton to lift the
trophy at Fir Park on May 21.
And with Scotland internationalists Shaun Bonnar and Chris McKenzie
both starring for Brain Fairley's side, they now believe the cup is not
beyond them.
Whitburn, too, have internationalists in David Scott and Paul Taylor
and, if shock side Lochee United were to be paired with them in the last
four, then a final spot is within their grasp as well.
Glenafton reached their fourth successive semi-final with a resounding
3-1 victory over an Arthurlie team who had six players booked and one
sent off.
Glens went 2-0 up with goals from Tom McKenzie and John Miller and,
despite a penalty from Davie Fulton of Arthurlie, they went further
ahead with a soft penalty converted by Stevie Farrell.
In the Whyte &amp; Mackay Cup, Beith's 4-1 victory over Ardeer Thistle
takes them through to the quarter-finals, where they will meet Pollok.
Shotts had a resounding 4-0 victory over Glencairn in the same
compeitition.
In the east section of the Cup, Hill O'Beath beat Linlithgow 2-1 in
the quarter-finals and now join Bo'ness, St Andrews, and Camelon or
Arniston.
Pollok continue to lead the Reebok League with a 2-0 win over
Lesmahagow thanks goals from Mills and Paisley. Maryhill lead the
chasing pack following a 2-1 victory over Dunipace.
0 Highest score of the day was Benburb's 9-2 away victory over
Larkhall Thistle -- trialist Nisbet scoring three goals.
Relegation threatened Neilston gained a welcome three points with
their 1-0 victory over Reebok First Division leaders Kilsyth Rangers.
In the Tayside Region, Forfar West End reached the final of the PA
Advertiser Cup following their 3-1 victory over Jeanfield Swifts. They
will now meet St Joseph's at McDiarmid Park on Tuesday, April 11.
Dalry Thistle have appealed against the SFA's #300 fine and ban from
next season's OVD Cup.
The Guinness Cup kicks off this weekend. Ireland will play Northern
Ireland at Petershill Park on Friday at 2.0 and the Isle of Man take on
Scotland at Lochburn Park, Maryhill, at 4.0.
The third and fourth-place play-off will be on Saturday at Maryhill at

<TEXT>
THE Princess of Wales remained defiantly unco-operative with the media
yesterday as the game of hide and seek between photographers and the
royal ski party continued into a third day.
Diana, who has tacitly posed for pictures on the slopes of Lech in
Austria in the past, again lost her cool and confronted a German
photographer who had gone up a chairlift after her.
As she went to remonstrate with him, she lost her concentration and
fell a few feet in front of him.
She said: ''Why are you following us? Leave us alone,'' before a ski
guide also came up to back up her message.
The Princess was clearly agitated and later also asked another
photographer to be left in peace.
Only a handful of photographers have followed the Princess, who is
skiing with friends Kate Menzies and Catherine Soames, but even this has
clearly irritated her.
She made an impassioned plea for her children to be left to ski in
peace on the first day of her nine-day holiday with Princes William and
Harry, resulting in a freelance TV cameraman commissioned by ITN being
dropped by the television news company.
But William, 12, and Harry, 10, skied separately from their mother
yesterday and have been largely left in peace by the media pack in the
resort.
The Princess seems to have decided not to co-operate with the media
this year, always looking away or putting her hands in front of her face
to put off photographers.
She stepped down from public life in December 1993, but has been
taking on more public and private duties recently.
Skiing holidays are private, but have always been traditionally
covered by the media eager for pictures of members of the royal family
on skis.
The Prince of Wales's visit to Klosters in Switzerland with William
and Harry in January was covered extensively by the media, who were
marshalled by the Prince's private secretary, Commander Richard Aylard.
Unlike last year, the Princess has not taken a Buckingham Palace press
officer and is shepherded only by royal protection officers.

<TEXT>
THE latest accident on the A77 brings the death toll on the road to 43
in the past five years.
They include some of the most horrific crashes that emergency services
have had to cope with in Scotland.
Last September three men in a stolen car died when it collided head-on
with a Jaguar driven by Lord Weir. Firefighters said the industrialist,
who suffered multiple injuries, owed his life to the airbag in his car.
In January Mrs Margaret Lynn, 50, died after she dashed on to the A77
Ayr by-pass to tend her dying son James, 18, who had been hit by a car.
Scottish Office figures released earlier this month show that the
yearly death toll on the A77 peaked in 1991 when there were 12
fatalities.
The figures show that the highest casualty toll on the road was
recorded in 1990 when 274 people were injured. One of the worst
incidents occurred in January 1993, when 18 people were injured in a
pile-up near Newton Mearns.
Strathclyde region's transport convener, Mr Charles Gordon, said
yesterday that he was not aware of plans to upgrade the 10 miles of
four-lane road to dual carriageway or motorway standard.
He said: ''The region merely acts as an agent for the Scottish Office
in road projects of this importance. It has still to be confirmed who
will take responsibility for the roads following local government
reorganisation.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said a ''general plan'' did exist to
extend the M77 and upgrade the rest of the A77 between Glasgow and Ayr.
However, he could not comment on the time scale.
Labour MP George Foulkes pointed out that only 20 of the A77's 87
miles were dual carriageway.
He said the Scottish Office had responded to criticisms of the road in
recent years by imposing a speed limit of 60 mph, installing more double
white line areas which forbid overtaking, and improving drainage and
signposting.
He added: ''There is no doubt that the A77 is Scotland's most
dangerous road.''

Falkirk 2, Kilmarnock 0
DOWN in the nether region of the premier division, which is about half
the league, wheeling and dealing is the name of the game. Rarely can
managers of teams in this zone indulge in the million-pound market (or
even half-a-million) which is the privilege of the wealthy, but they
still have to find players good enough to keep them on the tails of the
elite.
Jim Jefferies has been working on this basis for many years with some
success, but even he could not have been expecting as good a dividend
from his latest shopping trip.
His gamble seems to have paid off in some style, and it might well
prove to be the trick that saves his club from the despair of demotion.
Maurice Johnston, bought from Hearts, and Steve Kirk, acquired from
Motherwell, are not in the spring of their careers but, along with Paul
McGrillen, who is not 24 yet, they have brought a renewed optimism to
the Brockville club. None has been on a losing side yet but, more
important perhaps, team captain John Hughes -- who does not lack much in
commitment himself -- has been impressed by the way the three have
joined in the Falkirk cause.
Maybe that would have been expected of the Motherwell duo but there
would be some who might have wondered if Johnston was fully committed.
He has already given the lie to that on the park but Hughes revealed
that the former Scotland internationalist has been just as enthusiastic
in training.
Whatever criticism there has been of Johnston over the years, and
there has been some, especially from the east end of Glasgow, few have
ever accused him of not giving his all. That application remains intact,
as he demonstrated with a typical workaholic display in what could be a
vital victory for his new club. ''I didn't come here to play
first-division football,'' was his way of saying that he had every
confidence in Falkirk's prospects of retaining their premier status.
Hughes, who refers to Johnston and McGrillen as ''Batman and Robin''
-- ''they haven't scored yet and I don't think Mo has scored in
training'' -- was equally enthusiastic about the contributions of the
former Motherwell pair, who had seemed to have reached a cul de sac in
their Fir Park careers. His nickname for McGrillen is best left
unexplained. ''I can remember playing against wee Mowgli at Motherwell
and a right nuisance he was.''
Falkirk chairman, George Fulston, who described the transfer movements
as ''spring cleaning,'' was not short of a word or two in confidence,
either. ''We will go through the rest of the season unbeaten, I'm
telling you,'' he said, and Hughes was quick to agree. ''We have five of
our eight games at home and it suits us to see teams coming here and
trying to play on this tight pitch.''
Kilmarnock would have to agree because they tried and failed. The
confines of Brockville do not lend themselves to clever football,
especially in a division where the accelerator remains fully depressed
for 90 minutes, and Falkirk know that the more direct route to goal is
the correct option.
It did not make for a pretty picture but, as Jefferies was honest
enough to admit, the results are what count at this stage of a ferocious
relegation struggle.
His team are moving closer to safety after a run that has seen them
lose only once in six games, a run which included meeting the top three
in the league, but they are not there yet. Kilmarnock, two points behind
them, need to overcome their recent poor form if they are to escape but
there are a handful of teams still in danger of being involved in a
relegation play-off at least.
Jefferies pointed out, half-jokingly, that after his team next meet
Hearts, who are two points in front of them, they could be chasing a
Europe place, but it is not impossible.
They will take plenty of encouragement from their win over Killie, a
victory that looked likely from the moment Kirk scored his third goal in
four games after six minutes. Killie keeper Dragoje Lekovic had no
chance from the close-in header by the ex-Motherwell man but his habit
of punching the ball when it seems just as easy to catch it almost cost
his team more problems before the second goal 11 minutes from the end.
The keeper did push the ball out firmly enough from a Brian Rice
corner but straight to the feet of Colin McDonald, who steered it
immediately back through the busy penalty area into the net.
Kilmarnock had begun to look capable of snatching an equaliser by then
but that goal ended their ambitions.

A CHILDREN'S film in which the Prince of Wales appears to shrink
himself to three inches tall is to be distributed as a video by Disney
in a deal which could raise more than #1m for the Prince's Trust.
The Legend of Lochnagar, based on a story the Prince wrote for his
brothers when they were children, will be sold across the United States
and Canada.
The half-hour animation, made by Welsh TV station S4C in a
co-production with the BBC, has already been screened on TV in Britain,
the US and other countries.
In the story, the Old Man of Lochnagar has to be ''shrunkled'' to
grass-high size before he becomes concerned about the environment. It
ends with the Prince turning the same magic on himself.
The main story is told in cartoon form, but in the opening sequence a
group of children disturbs the Prince as he paints a watercolour.
After telling them the story of an old man who floods a pine marten's
home when he installs a bath, he ends the film by using movie magic to
cut himself down to miniature scale, calling it ''shrunkling''.
The Prince filmed Welsh and Gaelic language versions as well as
English, and later dubbed himself into French, Italian and German.
The video was already available in Britain and some other countries,
including France and Australia, and the Disney deal is only for North
America, said Chris Grace, director of animation at S4C.
Of a report that it could raise #1m for the Prince, he said:
''Obviously it is too soon for anyone to know. It all depends on the
sales.''
There was also the possibility of a publishing tie-up, giving US sales
for a book-of-the-video which had already been available in Britain, he
said.
Prince Charles had not been involved in negotiations with Mr Michael
Eisner, the Walt Disney chairman, although the subject was raised when
the two met in Los Angeles last November soon after talks between the
two sides began, he said.
''It is very rare for Disney to take anything from outside their own
stable to distribute,'' Mr Grace said.
''It shows their respect for British animation.''
Buckingham Palace said that Prince Charles was delighted by the
agreement. All the royalties due to him would go to his charity for
young people, the Prince's Trust.
Charities had also benefited by #200,000 paid to the Queen in
royalties for the BBC programme Elizabeth R, which marked the 40th
anniversary of her succession, a palace spokeswoman said.
Part had been used to set up a fund to help people train for
television work in the Commonwealth. The rest had gone to charities for
children, the elderly, sick and disabled, including those operating in
the Commonwealth.

EXCLUSIVE
A CATALOGUE of bungling by authorities at all levels may have helped
maintain a huge cover-up of the circumstances surrounding the death of
the prominent Scottish Nationalist, Mr Willie McRae.
The Herald can also reveal that:
* the young policeman who was the first officer on the scene has
confirmed he discovered the gun which killed Mr McRae yards from where
the body was found 24 hours earlier, despite official claims that he
committed suicide.
* witnesses confirmed vital evidence was removed from the scene of the
incident before a police investigation took place.
* Mr McRae was probably carrying secret documents which threatened the
success of a nuclear inquiry at the time of his death.
* the procurator-fiscal who examined his case has been told not to
talk about it to anyone.
The procurator-fiscal says he is bound by the Official Secrets Act.
Close friends of Mr McRae claim he was carrying secret documents
relating to the nuclear industry when he died mysteriously on a bleak
Highland road 10 years ago next week, and may have been the victim of
Government secret services.
Mr McRae, 61, a lawyer and leading figure in the SNP set off from
Glasgow on Friday, April 5, 1985, to spend the weekend at his cottage in
Kintail.
At 10am the next day he was found in his crashed Volvo by an
Australian tourist about 35 yards off the A87 near Loch Loyne.
The car was upright across a small burn and believed to have been
there since midnight.
The Australian waved down a car in which Dundee SNP councillor, Mr
David Coutts, was travelling to Skye with his wife Alison and two
friends.
Mr Coutts, who recognised Mr McRae, summoned an ambulance and the
police. He also discovered that Mr McRae's cheque cards and papers were
some way from the car, the papers meticulously torn up.
PC Kenny Crawford, a young constable on relief duty from Inverness,
quickly gathered personal items from the scene of the crash and placed
them in a holdall.
Mr Coutts told The Herald last night it seemed to him that the young
policeman was keen to get off the hillside quickly. ''He didn't even ask
for my name, but just bundled everything up,'' he said.
Mr Crawford has now talked freely about the incident for the first
time.
The injured Mr McRae was taken first to Raigmore Hospital Inverness
and later to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where he died at 3am on Sunday.
However, it was only when a nurse washed his head on his arrival at
Aberdeen that a gunshot wound in his right temple was discovered and the
police informed.
Officers from the Northern Constabulary revisited the scene of the
crash, but by then it was impossible to conduct the level of rigorous,
on-site investigation which might have produced crucial answers.
During the search PC Crawford found a Smith and Wesson .22 pistol
beyond where the car was found. It had been fired twice.
Mr Crawford, who has now left the force and is living in Inverness,
told The Herald that the gun was ''some yards'' downstream but he
believed it had been knocked from a ledge in the car when they had
retrieved Mr McCrae's body.
He also believes the gun had fallen into a small waterfall and the
fast running burn had transported the weapon from the site of the
vehicle.
However, Mr Coutts says that while removing Mr McCrae's body from the
car, PC Crawford's cap had fallen into the burn. He said he bent down
and retrieved it yet saw no sign of a gun.
The evidence contradicts statements made by former Solicitor-General
Peter Fraser that the gun was found directly under the door of the car.
The case was closed formally by Mr Thomas Aitchison, the
procurator-fiscal in Inverness, who decided the death was not
suspicious. Mr Fraser made the personal decision not to order a Fatal
Accident Inquiry into the death.
Last night Mr Aitchison said the case came under the Official Secrets
Act and he had been reminded at his retirement four years ago that he
was still bound by the Act.
''I was told not to talk about this case to anyone,'' he added.
A Crown Office spokesman told The Herald that all fiscals sign the
Official Secrets Act ''as a matter of course'' and there was nothing
suspicious in Mr Aitchison's comments.
Some aspects of Mr McRae's lifestyle have been used by the Crown over
the years to indicate he was potentially suicidal.
Yet on Friday April 5, 1985 he showed little sign of being a man about
to take his own life. His diary was full and he remarked to a number of
people that he was close to completing some important project. ''I've
got them, I've got them!'' he told friends excitedly, but expressed
fears that Special Branch was closing in on him.
They now say they believe he was carrying secret documents relating to
Dounreay at the time of his death.
Mr McRae had won a notable victory against the UK Atomic Energy
Authority in 1980 when he presented the principal legal opposition to
plans to dump nuclear waste in the Mullwharcher hills, Ayrshire.
He was planning to repeat the performance at the inquiry to reprocess
nuclear waste at Dounreay: his legal firm was named on the list of
objectors.
Last night a colleague of Mr McRae claimed that on the night of his
death he was carrying vital and confidential reports which showed
glaring holes in Dounreay's health and safety record.
The Herald was shown copies of these reports, which reveal problems
with various parts of the nuclear facility including areas of weakness
in Highly Active Analytical Cells and the discovery of a radiation field
from gamma particles hidden within a reprocessing plant.
Mr Peter Roche is a former activist for the Scottish Campaign to
Resist the Atomic Menace (Scram) who now works for Greenpeace. He said
it had been long-believed that Dounreay was being used as an unlicensed
emergency store for high quality plutonium, and Mr McRae may also have
had evidence of this.
In either case he was seen as a liability to Britain's controversial
nuclear industry.
A copy of the Mullwharcher report he is also said to have been
carrying was nowhere to be found after the incident. His other copy went
missing after a break-in and fire three years earlier at the Edinburgh
headquarters of Scram.
A year before his death, an elderly rose-grower and nuclear protester,
Hilda Murrell, was found murdered after important files had been stolen
from her home in Shrewsbury.
Mr McRae's home had often been broken into, he believed by British
secret services.
Mr John Conway, a retired police officer with the Northern
Constabulary has said: ''Because of who and what he was, William McRae
for years had been a 'known person' not only to the security service
MI5, but also to Special Branch officers of Strathclyde police and the
Northern Constabulary.''
Last night Mr Coutts added: ''Until the powers that be can prove
Willie's death was a suicide I am convinced there has been a massive
cover-up.
''I hope that as a result of The Herald's article we now get the
inquiry we have waited 10 years for.''
Mr Michael Strathern, a co-founder of the Willie McRae Society, said:
''It was only in 1990 that Peter Fraser said the gun had dropped from
the car. Earlier he said it was 'a mystery' how the gun was found so far
from the vehicle.''
A spokesman for the Celtic League said the new evidence had made the
case for an open inquiry into Willie McCrae's death ''irresistible''.
''He was certainly the most knowledgeable and capable anti-nuclear
campaigner in Scotland and had been a thorn in the flesh of the British
State for many years.''

AS SPECULATION continues to rage over the future ownership of the
island of Eigg, the local councillor yesterday revealed that the present
owner, the controversial Keith Schellenberg, has helped secure one of
the most significant housing developments in the island's history.
As a result, four new houses and a day care centre are to be built in
the crofting village of Cleadale, in the north-west of the island.
Another house, where an elderly woman lives in sub-standard conditions,
has been bought and will be upgraded.
The work will be carried out by the Lochaber Housing Association, who
will be the landlord. Dr Michael Foxley, who represents Mallaig,
Ardnamurchan, and the Small Isles on Highland Regional Council, and is a
founding member of the housing association, said yesterday: ''This might
not appear much, but on an island with a population of just over 70, it
is hugely important.
''These will be the first purpose-built houses for the elderly, and
the first to be built for rent independent of the estate. I am delighted
we have cracked this at long last.
''It has been made possible because of land generously offered by
Cleadale crofter Alastair Kirk. What is happening now is that the laird,
Keith Schellenberg has been persuaded to co-operate and he is currently
applying to the Scottish Land Court for permission for a resumption
order. Prices have been agreed, as have details of services, and so on.
''Highland Health Board is contributing #80,000 to the day care
centre, while Highland Regional Council's social work department will
fit it out and help with the revenue costs of running it.''
He said that the Government's housing body, Scottish Homes, meanwhile
had agreed to pay #395,000 of the #450,000 costs of building the homes.
The Lochaber Housing Association would raise the rest in a loan.
Dr Foxley continued: ''We said from the start that we wanted these
houses for the elderly, or people with young families. As part of the
deal, Dolly Ferguson, whose plight in living in such a sub-standard
house has attracted so much publicity, will now have her house upgraded.
The day centre will be there for the elderly, perhaps a playgroup, and
local community use.
''There is, however, still a problem with water supply. It was going
to cost nearly #500,000 to get the mains in, so Highland region's water
department is currently investigating ways of securing a good efficient
local supply.''
Dr Foxley said he did not know what was happening about the ownership
of the island, but even a change of laird would not now affect the
Cleadale development.
''I know that Keith Schellenberg comes in for a lot of criticism, much
of it justified, I dare say. On this occasion, however, he gave me his
word that he would co-operate with this development and he has stuck to
that and has done everything he could to conclude matters. I don't have
any time for the moral bankruptcy that is Highland landlordism, but
sometimes you have to work away quietly to get something of worth out of
it.''
Mr Schellenberg, who is currently on Eigg, refused yesterday to be
drawn on whether the #1.5m sale of the island to the German artist
Marlin Eckhard would be concluded later this week.
He did, however, tell The Herald: ''I understand there is more
speculation in the Sunday papers, but I can assure you that I still own
the island. No matter what happens now, the housing development at
Cleadale will go ahead. There will be no obstacles to that, whether I am
running the estate or not.
''Another thing that will go ahead is my sale of 1200 acres of croft
land at Cleadale to three native Hebrideans for #1 an acre. I can tell
you, these two projects have given me more pleasure than anything
else.''

STEPHEN FRAIL last night sidestepped the misery of possibly missing
out on a Scottish Cup medal. Instead, he predicted Hearts would have
their cup glory at Hampden.
The Tynecastle full back goes for surgery next week after snapping a
cruciate-knee ligament for the second time in an already frustrating
career.
But the 25-year-old cast aside his disappointment to say that he
believes the medal he has sought for so long could be coming the way of
his team-mates.
''The three other clubs who are involved will all present a sound case
for winning the cup, but I believe Hearts can do it,'' he insisted.
''I feel that our players are capable of beating any of the three, and
importantly, they have a deep-seated belief that they can do so.
''It would be a great consolation for me if they do go all the way,
but I would be desperately disappointed if they missed out.''
The Glasgow-born defender is likely to be absent for a year, having
previously missed two seasons -- in the first division at Dundee --
through a snapped ligament in his other knee.
But he is certain, as he faces a bleak 12 months ahead with steely
determination, that the previous experience will be vital as he prepares
for a second bout of agony.
He said: ''I know most of what lies ahead of me, and the sheer hard
work that will have to be done in the months ahead.
''I am determined to be positive and put everything into getting back
to the first team quickly. There is no point in brooding.
''With the injury at Dundee, I wondered if I would ever be back
playing again, and if I did, how good would I be.
''This time, I have the experience of a year playing at the highest
level behind me and I'm determined to achieve that standard again.''
Frail, who would surely be a candidate for player of the year in the
absence of Brian Laudrup, recently has been attracting interest from
Manchester City and others on both sides of the Border.
And there was more than a hint of irony in his smile as he recalled
the two daunting injuries, both sustained without a serious challenge
being made.
His studs caught in the turf in a match at Brechin, enforcing his
marathon Dundee absence, while, against Dundee United at Tannadice last
Tuesday, he stood on the ball before tumbling in pain.
But if the grit he displayed last night so soon after hearing the grim
news is any guide, Hearts fans can look forward to watching a strong
Frail again.
''I'll have the complete close season to start off the rehabilitation
process after a period of rest,'' he predicted.
''I understand the medical procedures are improving all the time in
this area, so I'm sure I'll be back a lot quicker than the last time.''

A SNAPSHOT of life in Scotland is revealed in new Scottish Office
statistics released over the weekend. The Scottish Abstract of
Statistics 1994 shows changing patterns and trends gathered from people
north of the Border.
The latest 210-page document has details of topics as diverse as the
most popular names and the number of Aids cases, to the top tourist
attraction.
It shows that, by the year 2001, more than one in six Scots will be
aged 65 and over compared with one in 20 in 1911.
Welsh football player Ryan Giggs seems to be influencing parents as
the name Ryan is now the second most popular boy's name in Scotland
behind Andrew. Emma continues to be the most popular girl's name.
Other diverse facts include that 55% of homes in Scotland were
owner-occupied, Edinburgh Castle continued to be the top tourist
attraction, and the number of road accidents was down 19% in comparison
with the equivalent annual figures for 1981-1985.
Glasgow Museum and Art Gallery remained the most popular free entry
attraction. The average weekly household expenditure on cigarettes in
1992/93 was #7.25 -- 43% higher than for Britain as a whole.
There were 40,503 referrals to Reporters to the Children's Hearings,
an increase of 35% on the 1983 figure. Around 18,000 private sector
houses were built in 1993 compared with just over 13,000 10 years
earlier.
The average local authority rent was #1281 in 1993 compared with #513
10 years before. The number of Aids cases in 1993 was 478 compared with
364 the year before. In Britain the total figure is 8529.
Crimes recorded by the police for 1993 were 543,000 compared with
590,000 the year before.
The number of primary pupils was down slightly at 438,900 while the
number of children at secondary schools was up from 296,000 in 1992 to
303,000 in 1993. The number of full-time teachers was around 45,000.
The mass of facts was complied by the Scottish Office central
statistics unit.

Airdrie 0, Dundee 3
THE long, the short, and the tall of Dundee's return to the top of the
first division was all crammed into 45 minutes at Broadwood Stadium. And
if the Taysiders do end up back in the premier division, it will be
mainly due to three contrasting players.
The long is the vastly experienced player-manager Jim Duffy, the short
is young Neil McCann, and the tall is the almost lethargic-looking, but
extremely talented, Morten Wieghorst.
After what simply was a dreadful first half, Duffy switched tactics,
brought Wieghorst into a deeper midfield role, and told him to supply
McCann on the wing at every opportunity.
McCann, rarely seen in the first 45 minutes, was told to get in behind
Airdrie's defence, and the overall result was devastating, particularly
from the Lanarkshire side's point of view.
And but for a couple of superb Martin saves, the result -- which now
has Airdrie struggling seven points off the lead -- would have been a
much heavier defeat.
McCann, still the target for top clubs -- Celtic assistant manager
Billy Stark was at the match -- is obviously under pressure from all the
speculation about his future.
But after the match, he said: ''I'm trying to stay out of all that.
It's up to the manager to handle anything to do with signing talks, and
I'm certainly not going to see him to ask if anyone is coming for me.
Apart from anything else, I'm trying to get a bit of form back. I have
not been playing very well.
''However, this result has given the whole team a boost in confidence,
and sets us up nicely for next week's trip to Dunfermline.''
While Stark was ostensibly there to watch McCann, he could not fail to
be impressed by Wieghorst's display. The big man has hardly looked back
since being capped by Denmark as they won an international tournament in
Dubai.
And there is little doubt that it was his second-half foresight --
aided by McCann's trickery -- which set up the goals for Ray Farningham,
and a well-taken double by George Shaw.
As for Airdrie, they just seemed to fall flat, and it would have been
informative if manager Alex MacDonald had hung around to discuss their
forthcoming Scottish Cup semi-final against Hearts on April 8.
Instead, we are left to speculate on two below-average performances in
a row since they beat Raith in the last round. MacDonald admitted that
last week's late win at Ayr had been more than a trifle fortunate, and
on Saturday, Dundee merely proved what Ayr could have done last week.
All MacDonald would say was: ''There were five things happened out
there today, and I don't want to say any more.''
Mysterious, indeed. In fact, almost as big a mystery as Airdrie's form
slump, and indeed why keeper John Martin plays week in, week out, with a
knee injury which prevents him taking bye kicks. This chore is taken on
by a defender, but it means that, if the kick-out lands at the feet of
the opposition, there is no chance of an offside trap working. Dundee
almost made Airdrie pay heavily for that on several occasions on
Saturday.

FOR 50 years, the Duke of Edinburgh has been cursed by generations of
Fifers for referring to the East Fife port of Methil as ''a dump''.
But now the Duke has written to quash the myth which has entered into
folk legend in Methil.
In a letter to the Lower Methil Heritage Centre, he says: ''The truth
is that I served from January 1942 till December 1943 in HMS Wallace of
the Rosyth escort force.
''Our duties were to escort East Coast convoys from the Firth of Forth
to Sheerness and back. These convoys used to form up in Largo Bay or off
Burntisland, where the ships of the REF joined them from Rosyth for the
journey south. There was, therefore, no opportunity for any of us to go
ashore at Methil.''
The Duke continues: ''I have visited all that coast since the war and
I remember passing through Methil some years ago with the Queen. But I
am quite sure that I never described it as 'a dump'.''
Yesterday, townsfolk welcomed the Duke's letter.
Adam Smith, 23, manager of the Lower Methil Heritage Centre, said,
''This letter clears the air. I was amazed at the response of local
people to the mere mention of the Duke's name. He is highly unpopular,
to say the least.''
Margaret Davies, 40, of High Street, Methil, said: ''Every age group
has heard about the Duke's remarks. It is a story which has gone about
for years.
''We do have problems with drugs and high unemployment. And 25 years
ago we did have certain reputation because of the ladies of the night.
''When I was a teenager, I would never tell anybody I came from Methil
-- I was too embarrassed.
She added: ''But it has improved a lot with nice new housing and
improvements to the shops in the High Street.''
John Allan, 33, of Barrie Road, Methil is a proud local. He said: ''We
moved here seven years ago. I like it. I'm a boating enthusiast and its
handy for the boat club. It's a braw place.''

A MAN was found dead and three others were taken to hospital after
being discovered, apparently ill, in a house in Kilmarnock yesterday.
The dead man was last night identified as Mr David Eardly, 20, from
Mitchell Road, Cumbernauld. Mr Eardley's death is believed to be drug-
related.
Strathclyde police said one man, a 25-year-old, was in intensive care
in Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock last night. Two others, aged 24 and
21, were released after treatment.
The alarm was raised by a friend who found all four in a house in
Glebe Road, Kilmarnock.
Detectives in Kilmarnock said there were no suspicious circumstances
and a report is being prepared for the procurator-fiscal.
Mr Eardley's death brings the total of drugs deaths in Strathclyde
this year to 14.
Detective Constable Andy McWilliam of Kilmarnock CID said: ''Further
inquiries will be made tomorrow after a post-mortem has been carried
out.''

IAN STEWART is the toast of Lossiemouth after his stunning performance
in the McEwans Lager North Cup final victory over Fort William.
The former Dundee striker once again showed what a devastating
finisher he is with a brilliant hat trick in the 4-0 victory which took
his season's tally to a staggering 37.
No wonder Lossiemouth have put a #50,000 price tag on his head to
frighten off approaches from teams such as Caledonian Thistle and
Arbroath.
Manager Fraser Kellas certainly would not want to lose the services of
a man regarded as the one of the classiest players in Highland football.
Such lethal marksmen are few and far between and Lossiemouth will be
hoping he remains happy to stay where he is.
It took Stewart only two minutes to tuck away the first of his treble.
Fort keeper Ronnie MacPherson could only parry Darren Still's shot and
Stewart nipped in to score from six yards.
Three minutes later, Still's thumping left-foot drive from 15 yards
sailed past MacPherson for goal No. 2.
Lossie did have a couple of worrying moments when Ian Polworth hit a
post and Ivor Pirie had to turn away an Alan MacDonald drive. But
another three-minute spell in the second half guaranteed the cup was
going to Lossiemouth.
Man-of-the-match Stewart chested down a David McInnes cross before
crashing a right-foot drive beyond MacPherson in 73 minutes, then he
headed home the third after Steve Gerrard's header was punched out by
MacPherson.
It was Lossiemouth's first trophy for 34 years and manager Kellas
dedicated it to his father, Ron, the club's vice-president, who died
last week.
Ron Kellas was one of the north's great soccer characters and the
Lossie manager desperately wanted to win the cup as a tribute to him and
his uncle, Norman, who died last year.
His players certainly did not let him down.
In the league, the three games that survived produced 18 goals. Brora
thumped Elgin 6-4, with Davy Ross getting a treble in a bad-tempered
affair in which Brora's Jocky MacKay and City's John Davidson and John
Mutch were red-carded by referee Kevin Bissett.
Huntly virtually clinched the title with Martin Stewart grabbing two
in the 5-0 drubbing of Deveronvale, and Fraserburgh coasted to a 3-0 win
at Cove.

THE Midas touch which new managers seem to bring with them, if often
only temporarily, has worked at Meadowbank Thistle already. No sooner is
the larger-than-life Jim Leishman appointed in charge than the
relegation-haunted Edinburgh team pull off a 1-0 victory, over the
second division leaders no less.
The goal which gave them their first home victory for nine weeks came
after 24 minutes when, following a corner, Jason Young beat two
Dumbarton defenders before shooting home -- sheer poetry, Leishman
probably was thinking.
The Sons fought back and Martin Mooney came nearest to spoiling
Leishman's perfect start, but there was no denying the revived Edinburgh
team.
Now Leishman's men have Queen of the South in their sights, just five
points above them, but it looks as though that will be the only
relegation doubt -- which of the two will accompany Brechin City to the
cellar.
The bottom club, after a series of tight matches and the odd victory,
found Stenhousemuir back in purposeful mood at Ochilview.
Terry Christie's Warriors, having had questions asked of them in
recent weeks, returned to winning ways with a 3-0 scoreline. Jimmy
Fisher shot the opener and Miller Mathieson stepped in with a double
near the break.
No matter that this was against the weakest opposition in the
division; a win is a win, and 'Muir have shed the burden of doubt which
had begun to jeopardise their promotion hopes. This was their first
victory since the season threatened to turn sour after the cup exit at
the hands of Hibs, and, after the concession of 14 goals in four games,
it was a return to the clean sheets of earlier in the season.
They now share second place with Morton, who again had to settle for a
draw, despite a double by Marko Rajamaki.
Willie Watters finished off a good move to put Stirling Albion ahead
with his thirteenth goal of the season, but Rajamaki beat two men before
shooting the equaliser, and the Finn went on to give the home side the
lead just before the hour mark. Albion's late equaliser came from Morton
striker Derek Lilley, who had the misfortune to put through his own net
when he was back trying to help out his defence.
Albion remain in the hunt, as do Clyde, who drew 1-1 with the
fourth-placed side, Berwick Rangers. A Tommy Graham header put the
Borderers in front but veteran George McCluskey tapped in a rebound near
half-time to keep Clyde in touch.
East Fife have crept back into the promotion picture, just six points
off second place after a 3-1 home win over Queen of the South, who
scored first through a Steve Mallan penalty. Back came Steve Archibald's
men through a Robert Scott double, which sandwiched a Paul Hunter goal.
That took Scott's tally for the season to 15, making him joint-top
scorer in the division with Berwick's Warren Hawke.
The pair could be in direct opposition next Saturday when the Fifers
are at home to Berwick. At this stage of the season, such matches have
to be regarded as a series of promotion eliminators.

THERE is something to be said for the old boys' network. East
Stirlingshire managed to fix up Scott Sneddon when former Queen's Park
team-mate Glen Millar passed on the word that the defender was
available, and the latest signing brought Murray Hunter to link up with
former Whitehill Welfare team-mate Lee Cuthbert at Firs Park.
Hunter had played a couple of trials for the promotion-chasing Falkirk
club, but Saturday's game against Cowdenbeath was his home debut as an
official 'Shire player. Not only did he score, but it was the only goal
and it helped 'Shire to consolidate their second position.
The difference in East Stirlingshire this season seems to be the
build-up which comes from Colin Scott and Iain Lee in midfield. Scott
missed Saturday's game through injury, but Lee was there to tidy up
possession and put through a few telling passes.
Hunter's goal came nine minutes from the break when he shot through a
ruck of players and his effort got a helpful deflection. Ironically,
'Shire missed better chances in the rest of the game. ''We failed with
the final pass and with our finishing,'' said manager Billy Little, who
refuses to become too excited about his club's very promising league
position.
Cowden manager Paddy Dolan, despite his club's eighth straight defeat,
was encouraged by what he saw as hopeful signs. He explained that his
side's slump had followed the cup defeat at Cove Rangers. Cowden had two
players sent off and the automatic suspensions led to a period of
unwanted chop-and-change as Dolan was unable to field a settled side.
Forfar went marching on towards the title with a 2-1 win at Montrose,
with shots by Steve McCormick and Ian McPhee giving them insurance
against Alan Kennedy's late penalty for the home side.
But Montrose are still in the hunt, as are the third and fourth sides,
Ross County and Alloa, after their 1-1 draw at Recreation Park. Keith
McCulloch's scoring lob was immediately cancelled by Roddy Wylie's own
goal, and Alloa's day was not helped by a late red card for striker
Barry Moffat for an off-the-ball incident.
Something had to give at Hampden, and it was Hugh McCann's 100% record
since he took over as Queen's Park manager. After two wins, they went
down 3-2 to Arbroath, who were recording their seventh straight win.
Brian McPhee put Queen's ahead but Steve Tosh shot an equaliser and
David Pew gave John Brogan's team the lead. Steve McCormick seemed to
have ensured a point five minutes from time, but seven minutes later a
Lee Gardner penalty took the three points to Gayfield.

Dunfermline 1 St Mirren 1
PERHAPS the Saints will not go marching out of the first division
after all in mid-May, as many had predicted.
St Mirren are far too close to the wrong end of the table, and with
this in mind, Love Street manager Jimmy Bone could have been excused for
harbouring a feeling of apprehension when his team's bus rolled up
outside East End Park early on Saturday afternoon.
After all, they were visiting mighty Dunfermline, the league leaders,
but the strange thing was that, had the identity of the sides been
unknown before a ball was kicked, not in a million years could an
onlooker have selected the team in black-and-white kit as being the
high-fliers.
Outplayed, out-thought, out . . . well, just about everything except
outlasted, the home lot's equaliser coming with the second-last kick of
the ball and after 93 minutes had elapsed.
Was Bone upset, angry that his team had come so close to gaining just
their fifth league win of the season? Don't be foolish. How could he be,
so well had his men gone about their work.
But inwardly, deep down the man must have been just a little cross,
and with some justification. Some of his players had to be restrained
from informing referee Martindale, in the most direct fashion, that
instead of the ball striking a man from Paisley prior to the fateful
corner, from which Andy Tod netted the equaliser, in fact it was
Dunfermline captain Norrie McCathie's skull which had the final touch.
One of those most annoyed was St Mirren's experienced keeper and coach
Campbell Money.
''The consensus of opinion was that the original decision of awarding
the corner was wrong,'' he said. ''But that is what the referee is there
for. Unfortunately for us, he gave a corner. It's disappointing because
we felt we had done enough to earn the three points.''
Bone, too, was quizzed about this important incident, but not wishing
to be summoned by those who must be obeyed in Park Gardens for speaking
his mind, the manager smiled quietly, paused for a while before saying:
''You were at the game, you write what you like.''
But if Bone was keeping a tight lid on his frustration, he was swift
to bestow praise on his employees for their performance. ''We were the
best team throughout,'' he said. ''It was a good performance, but when
you are struggling, there is always something that knocks you out of
your stride. However, we are coming back to our best.''
On the subject of best, and with the league race on the final circuit,
Bone has his idea of the winner, come prize-giving day.
''There is not much difference between the sides at the top,'' he
claimed. ''Raith Rovers are the best team, but Dunfermline have been
over the course and know what to expect. I think they will make it.''
Of course, Bone may be right, but unless Dunfermline manager Bert
Paton starts tinkering with his outfit -- and soon -- they may again
remain holding the bouquet while someone else nips off to have the fun,
as has been the case in recent times.
Assistant manager Dick Campbell went on about his team's ''battling
qualities,'' which is not open to question, but it will take much more
than that to gain promotion and considerably more ability than
Dunfermline displayed on Saturday to remain afloat, if indeed they reach
the premier division.
And the sight of Hamish French going home with an arm in a surgical
support will not have gladdened the heart of those who attend East End
Park on a regular basis.
The striker has a broken collarbone, and will be absent for quite some
time. It seems that it is as tough at the top as it is at the other end.
The small travelling band of St Mirren followers were like pups in a
basket after 67 minutes when their favourite son, Barry Lavety, broke a
six-month goal drought for the opener. But by this time, the visitors
could have been three up.
New league leaders Dundee are the next club scheduled to pop into East
End Park. They hold a two-point lead over Saturday's hosts, and with
French and Kenny Ward both on the panel, and the Dunfermline defence
looking more than a little vulnerable, Dundee could be well worth an
interest in the fixed-odds lists -- and possibly for the title itself.
Paton went on at some length in the match programme as to his fears
about playing at Firhill in a play-off match as a way of gaining access
to the premier division.
The condition of the playing surface at Partick Thistle's ground,
rightly, is a worry to the Dunfermline overseer, but unless his men pull
up their collective socks, such matters may only be of concern to
others.

St Johnstone 1, Ayr United 1
THE unmistakable blunt Yorkshire diction of Ayr United player-manager
Simon Stainrod projected a characteristic message of defiance as he
reflected on his team's fighting draw at McDiarmid Park on Saturday
against promotion-hunting St Johnstone.
''We're sitting two points behind St Mirren,'' he said ''and we play
them away from home on the last day of the season. If we have to go to
Love Street on May 14 needing three points to stay up, then that's a
challenge I'll be happy to face.''
What Ayr United perhaps lack in footballing finesse is compensated by
the level of determination and commitment which is apparent.
At half-time on Saturday they looked a beaten side. Down 1-0 thanks to
a bizarre own goal by defender Neil McKilligan after seven minutes, they
had failed to trouble Saints' keeper Alan Main in the slightest, and had
it not been for the heroics of their own goalkeeper, Cammy Duncan, not
to mention the crossbar, the game could have been over at that stage.
Stainrod's men, however, were a changed squad in the second half.
Cameron Connie had a shot cleared off the line five minutes after the
interval and, after Duncan had shown outstanding agility to deflect a
viciously struck free kick from St Johnstone's Sean McAuley, the
equaliser arrived when Ross Tannock took advantage of a weakly punched
clearance by Main to head the ball into the roof of the net 13 minutes
from time.
''It was a great result considering we were without five experienced
players,'' enthused a happy Stainrod. ''I brought in Ross Tannock and I
felt that he, and those around him, played particularly well.''
Saints' opener had arrived when a deep cross from Paul Cherry was
headed into the goalmouth by Phillip Scott and deflected by McKilligan
past his own keeper.
Scott then hit the crossbar as the home side assumed control, but St
Johnstone were unable to add to their lead, and suffered accordingly
when Ayr fought back to take that point which could be so valuable by
the time it comes to May.
St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock understandably was disappointed
with the result and appeared critical afterwards with regard to the lack
of character which had been shown by certain of his players. He did,
however, appear pleased by the performance of 17-year-old midfield
debutant Stuart McCluskey, and indicated that there were others like him
who are on the verge of first-team recognition.
''I gave young Stuart McCluskey his chance today,'' said Sturrock,
''and there are four or five more youngsters I hope to blood before the
end of the season.''
However, he rejected the suggestion that such a course of action was
tantamount to surrendering any lingering hopes of promotion, adding:
''While the championship may be outwith our reach, I still think we have
a chance of taking second place.''
Saints remain in fifth spot, four points behind Airdrie, and although
they have now gone 10 league games without defeat, their chances of a
return to the premier division would appear to be diminishing rapidly.

Stranraer 0, Hamilton Accies 5
STRANRAER are slowly being wiped off the map of the first division.
This defeat by from Hamilton on the same day St Mirren took a point at
Dunfermline sees the coastal side seven points from safety with as many
games remaining.
Saturday's performance gave little hope that they will make up the
deficit as they were outplayed and outfought by a mid-table Hamilton
side.
Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie was philosophical in defeat. ''When
you get into the ring, there only two fighters, no friends, and you have
to battle for your life. That wasn't a boxing match, we had no fight, no
spirit, and no appetite for the game.''
If it had been a boxing match, it would have been stopped early.
Hamilton's centre midfield pairing of Mike Waters and Raymond McStay
worked tirelessly, controlling the game, pinning their hosts firmly in
their own half.
In Peter Duffield, they have a deadly striker who, with 19 goals this
season, is oozing confidence. His two first half goals were merely the
beginning of the rout.
The first came from an Ian McCall pass which made a mockery of
Stranraer's offside trap, and the striker ran unchallenged from the
centre circle to finish easily. Seven minutes later, he pounced for his
second.
Stranraer regrouped at half time pushing Robert Reilly up front,
Graham Duncan into centre midfield and John Robertson wide on the right.
It seemed to be working as they put the Hamilton defence under pressure,
but the lack of a target man meant any attack dwindled to a
disappointing end.
With Lex Grant suspended, their strike force already was weakened, but
the continuing lack of an in-form goalscorer has been their weakness all
season.
McCall showed the way at the other end, scoring directly from a corner
kick. Home heads went down, and Charlie McLean added the fourth in the
seventieth minute. The towel was in the ring long before Raymond McStay
curled the last kick of the game into Stranraer's top left corner to
complete the result.
Hamilton manager Iain Munro said: ''It's a long journey back, but it's
a lot easier with three points and five goals. Stranraer have done
remarkably well, but it's very difficult for a part-time team in this
division.''
Munro also was pleased with Scott McCulloch, the teenager who was
signed in midweek from Rangers. ''I was delighted with Scott's
performance, but it was a great team effort and players like Ray McStay,
Mike Waters, and Charlie McLean all did exceptionally well.''
Five points behind second bottom Ayr, and with a run-in that includes
encounters with Airdrie, Dunfermline, and Dundee, it seems Stranraer are
destined for the drop.

Frankfurt,
ANDREI Kanchelskis, the explosive star of Manchester United and
Russia, wants to play for Rangers next season.
The 26-year-old internationalist, a close friend of Ibrox player
Alexei Mikhailichenko, sent the positive and clear message to Rangers
manager Walter Smith from the Russians' training camp in Frankfurt
yesterday.
His contract at Old Trafford ends this summer, and the player is
convinced that he will not be re-signing after weeks of feuding with
manager Alex Ferguson.
Yesterday, he told me: ''I do not see myself staying with Manchester
United after the summer. But I want to stay in British football, and
what I would like most of all is to sign for Rangers.''
Kanchelskis has been an outstanding success in the four years he has
been in England. However his recent troubles have convinced him that he
must move on, and he wants his next stop to be Ibrox.
He revealed: ''I speak to Alexei all the time. When I am at home, it
is almost every day that we talk on the telephone.
''That is how I know all about Rangers. They are as big a club as
Manchester United.
''When I come back to Manchester after the Scotland game, my agent and
I will be talking to Alex Ferguson, but I just don't think I will be
staying there. However, I have enjoyed my football in Britain. The way
the game is played appeals to me.
''There is always action, and always goals and you have games with a
5-3 scoreline or 4-2 or maybe 3-3. I enjoy that.
''I also like playing in front of big crowds, and Rangers have crowds
as big as United do. If I leave United, I want to stay in British
football and Rangers would be my first choice.''
Kanchelskis plays wide on the right, which has been a problem position
for the Scottish champions.
Manager Smith, constantly searching for players in Europe may find one
just 250 miles down the M6.
Certainly, the views expressed by Kanchelskis underline that the
Glasgow giants are looked on as major players in the transfer market by
the top footballers.
Meanwhile, Kanchelskis is concentrating on the match against Scotland.
And he expressed surprise that his Manchester United team-mate Brian
McClair will not be in opposition to him. He said ''I cannot believe
that Brian has not been selected. I know how well he is playing for the
team.
''Perhaps I am biased because he is my room-mate when we are away from
home, but I just believed that he would be in Moscow because of his form
just now.
''I am looking forward to meeting up again with Tom Boyd. He has been
a difficult opponent for me. He is such a good defender -- and he can
also go forward.
''But the best news for us is that Duncan Ferguson is out. I have seen
him in England with Everton. He is strong, and aggressive. He would have
given our defence problems. Not just in the air, where he is so good but
also on the ground where he is very clever.''
Russian team manager Oleg Romantsev has been hit by two late injury
problems.
And one of them came because he allowed his German-based players to
play in the Bundesliga on Saturday. The result of that was that top
striker Sergei Kuryakov limped into the team's hotel on Saturday night
after having played for Karlsruhe in the 0-0 draw with Cologne.
Said Romantsev: ''We try our best to keep the clubs and the players
happy, and now we have suffered for that.
''Because we were training in Frankfurt, I allowed Kuryakov to play in
his league game, and now he has reported injured.''
Defender Vasily Kulkov, another man Scotland manager Craig Brown
believed would play, has also been ruled out.

* NO licking of wounds and no wallowing in self-pity. Scotland have a
job to do in Moscow on Wednesday and manager Craig Brown was busy
yesterday trying to talk his players and perhaps even himself into the
proper frame of mind.
He made brief mention of as many as 10 players, many of whom would
have been first choice but who are unavailable because of injuries, but
he stressed that it was more important to accentuate the positive.
''I still have some good players and I'll be putting in the fighters,
the foot soldiers and hope that they can do it,'' Brown said. ''Against
the Russians I want my players to get in about them, to get tackles
in.''
The Russians, who drew 1-1 at Hampden last November, have four points
from their two games -- they beat San Marino 4-0 -- and occupy fourth
place, two points behind Finland, who have six points from four games.
Scotland, of course, are in second place with seven from four, with
Greece leading the race to qualify for the European Championships.
The Greeks have maximum points from their four outings and even though
they beat Scotland 1-0 in Athens, Brown remains convinced the Russians
are the real threats in the section. ''From what I've seen and from the
reports I've had the Russians are much tougher,'' he said. ''They are
the best team in the group.''
However, Brown wouldn't want that to read as though he is saying his
players couldn't take at least a point from this game and he insisted
his side will not adopt a negative approach. ''We've got to be convinced
we are going to score in Moscow,'' Brown added.
''The Russians, in fact, displayed the correct attitude when they
played in Glasgow and made sure that they scored. We have to display
that same desire.''
Brown also pointed out that after Wednesday's match in the Luhzniki
Stadium his players will have negotiated their most demanding schedule
in that they will have played away in Helsinki, Athens, and Moscow.
''Also, the Greeks have still to go to Finland and they have to play
Russia twice also,'' he said. ''If we can take something from this game
it would be a great help, but all would not be lost if we don't, because
of our games at home against Greece and Finland, which we really have to
win.''
Brown is sure to play with two front players, John McGinlay and Duncan
Shearer, who was called in as a replacement stiker after it became clear
Duncan Ferguson would not be joining up with the squad, and both will
have to produce the performances of their lives if they are to unnerve
the Russian defenders.
They will also need quality supply from the midfield and that is where
players like Gary McAllister, Paul McStay, and John Collins will have to
take responsibility.

FANS, footballers and officials alike paid tribute to Davie Cooper at
the weekend.
Floral tributes, scarves, pictures and special messages have been
placed at Ibrox, Fir Park and Kilbowie Park, while Saturday's football
matches observed a minute's silence in tribute to the former Scotland
internationalist, who died on Thursday.
His funeral will take place today at Hillhouse Parish Church on the
outskirts of Hamilton. Thousands of mourners are expected to flock to
the church where police were yesterday finalising crowd control plans.
The funeral cortege will move on to Bent Road Cemetery, where there
will be a private burial.

WORLD champion Michael Schumacher, of Germany, and Scotland's David
Coulthard were disqualified after having first and second respectively
in yesterday's Brazilian Grand Prix.
Austrian Gerhard Berger, who finished the race in third place, was
declared the winner by Formula One officials after the cars driven by
Schumacher and Coulthard were found to have been using irregular fuel
during the season-opening event.
The race result hung in the balance for more than five hours while
fuel samples were tested after Schumacher had finished first in his
Benetton ahead of Coulthard's Williams.
Both Schumacher and Coulthard had already been found to have broken
the strict fuel regulations during practice and qualifying, and the
Benetton and Williams teams were each fined $30,000.
Berger had been followed home in his Ferarri by Finland's Mika
Hakkinen, in a McLaren, ahead of Frenchman Jean Alesi in the second
Ferrari.
Schumacher's chief rival, Briton Damon Hill, failed to finish after
having spun off with gearbox problems after 31 laps of the 71-lap race.
The race itself had gone well for the young Scot. He equalled his
previous best in Portugal last year and signalled that, after only nine
grands prix, he has the talent to emerge as a serious world-title
contender.
Hill's hopes of winning from the fifth pole position of his career
were wrecked when he spun off while leading. He said gearbox problems
had been affecting him for several laps.
''I had gearbox problems half a lap before,'' said Hill. ''I lost
second gear and was on the radio to the pits when something broke.
''I was looking good and feeling comfortable. I'm very, very
disappointed.''
Schumacher, who had crossed the line first for the eleventh time in 53
starts, took the lead from the start but lost it during the first series
of pit-stops. When he pitted for the second time after Hill's
retirement, Coulthard took the lead and held it for 12 laps before he
also stopped to refuel.
The Benetton team strategy of three pit stops to Williams' two paid
off as it had last season when Schumacher was able to pit for the third
time and retain his lead all the way to the chequered flag.
However, before the fuel bombshell sent off, Schumacher was upbeat.
''It's fantastic,'' said the German, who paid tribute to the Benetton
crew for overcoming the steering problem which caused his high-speed
crash on Friday. ''After what happened, I would have been very happy
with second or third.''
Coulthard, who overcame a bout of tonsillitis to take his place in the
opening race, said: ''I was shaking so much, my feet came off the pedals
and there were many times I thought I was going to go off.
''To get second place is fantastic. I knew it was going to be hard
physically, because I've not been able to train.'' Result:
1, 1, G Berger (Austria) Scuderia Ferrari; 2, M Hakkinen (Finland)
Marlboro McLaren Mercedes; 3, J Alesi (France) Scuderia Ferrari; 4, M

THE son of football manager Lou Macari was yesterday bound over to
keep the peace after swearing at fans and police.
Michael Macari, 22, a professional footballer, launched attack after
his father's Stoke City side were beaten 2-0 at a home match against
Portsmouth on February 2.
Magistrates bound him over to keep the peace for 12 months for #100
after dropping a charge of offensive conduct.
Prosecutor Ann Bissell told Stoke-on-Trent magistrates that Macari
went over to a group of men who were arguing outside the Victoria
Ground.
She said: ''They exchanged abusive language . . . in front of women
and children. Police were concerned it was getting out of control.
''When police asked Macari to move on, he became abusive and was
arrested.''
Defending, Mr David James said Macari had become involved in the
argument after one of the men made insulting and threatening remarks
about his younger brother Paul Macari, who plays for the Stoke City
reserve team.
Michael Macari -- who lives with his parents in Trentham,
Stoke-on-Trent -- was released by Stoke City last year. He has trained
with neighbours Port Vale and is currently looking for a new club.

<HEADLINE>Local consortium lodges bid for Rosyth. Group revealed among front-runners to take over Fife naval base.</HEADLINE>

THE front-runners in the competition to buy the Rosyth Naval Base in
Fife emerged last night as a local consortium, an Indian company, and
two American firms.
The Herald can reveal that the consortium, Rosyth 2000, officially
lodged its bid with the Ministry of Defence on Tuesday.
The group, made up of the Bank of Scotland, Forth Ports PLC, Babcock
International, and ScottishPower, confirmed a long-term redevelopment
plan had been sent for consideration to the MoD in London.
The MoD is expected to receive up to #15m for the 355-acre base
situated next to Rosyth naval dockyard, which Babcock International is
negotiating to buy.
Rosyth 2000's proposal would take in both the naval base and the
dockyard, with most of the planned job creation coming from a new
development on the naval base. The dockyard would be leased to Babcock.
It is believed the consortium would hope to invest around #100m and
create up to 2000 jobs on the whole site over a 10-year period.
Its proposal came as the MoD called in Ryden, a Scottish-based
international property company, to market the base which is due to close
in April, 1996.
Ryden has been instructed to seek ''expressions of interest'' by May 5
and for formal offers to be lodged by May 31.
A world-wide marketing campaign will be launched this week to
stimulate interest from other foreign companies.
Advertising space has been booked in publications such as The Wall
Street Journal and the South China Morning Post.
Property sources last night revealed ''serious, genuine interest'' in
the site has been shown by an Indian shipping firm and two American
companies.
The identities of the companies are not yet known.
However, naval base sources said the Indian firm, which had sold
warships to the Indian navy, had voiced a serious interest. It is
believed it would carry out minor ship repairs at the base. Experts
believe major investment on the site is needed to make any other work
viable.
The base sources also said that the two American firms had voiced
interest in possibly using part of the facility as a fabrication yard.
Again major investment is required on site for such work to take place.
Ryden's managing partner in Edinburgh, Mr Roy Durie, said yesterday:
''The closure of HM naval base at Rosyth is obviously a huge economic
blow to Fife.
''Fife region is now the region with the highest unemployment rate in
Scotland.
''However, this is an excellent deep water facility and considerable
interest has already been expressed in the base. We are hopeful that the
sale of the base will be the first step towards attracting new
employment and investment to Rosyth.''
The site on the north shore of the Firth of Forth includes a deep
water berth, railway servicing, and around one million sq ft of
buildings.
The Royal Navy will retain HMS Caledonia to the north-west of the base
as a support facility and occupation of the Royal Navy stores depot
within the base.
Mr Durie continued: ''We believe the base will be of interest to
commercial port operators and developers. The land and buildings have
the potential for conversion to an industrial or business park with
port-related facilities. There is even potential to create a ferry
terminal, possibly a roll-on, roll-off one.''
Fife Regional Council official, Mr Eric Byiers, said the council were
obviously keen to have the site redeveloped and see jobs created.
Mr Byiers, senior depute director of economic development and
planning, said the council was keeping a close eye on the plans.
Meanwhile, Mr Terry Smith, property director of Forth Ports PLC, said
the consortium's application would have been received by the MoD
yesterday.
Mr Smith, who helped co-ordinate the development of the site, said:
''This is a well considered plan we have put forward.
''It is based on industry and manufacturing jobs, of which there is
expertise in the area.
''We would take over the naval base and dockyard. We would lease back
the dockyard to Babcock's and develop the naval base.
''We feel the project is the best one for the area. It was sent to the
MoD yesterday for their consideration.''

<HEADLINE>Call to arms in Blair's war of nerves</HEADLINE>

Geoffrey Parkhouse, Political Editor, reports how Labour's
sabre-rattling over a General Election is aimed at rallying its troops
and creating panic in Tory ranks
IN a deft move, Labour leader Tony Blair is instigating a war of
nerves against the Tories by putting his party on alert for an autumn
General Election. Jumpy and accident-prone, the Tories were hoping that
they might at least get through to next spring before being forced to
the country.
Blair argues to his Shadow Cabinet that panic could edge the Tory
parliamentary party into another leadership election. A new leader might
then seek a snap election on an outside chance of a win or a
damage-limitation exercise.
Another scenario is that by-election attrition, combined with
continuing obduracy on the part of Tory rebels, plus total
disenchantment of the Ulster Unionists, could bring the Government to
disaster. Mr Blair might be able at last to defeat Mr Major on an issue
of confidence.
So far, Mr Jim Molyneaux and his eight fellow Ulstermen show no
inclination to defeat the Government on a game-plan set by Labour. Dr
Ian Paisley and his two Ulster colleagues are believed to take the same
attitude to Blair blandishments. But that could change, if Mr Major
throws them into despair over concessions to the Sinn Fein/IRA.
Whether or not an autumn election is feasible, Mr Blair is smart to
trumpet that his party will be ready for action. It puts a nice edge on
the build-up to the local elections in Scotland next month and those
that follow in England in May. Big Tory losses are expected, as the mood
of the country remains resolutely antipathetic towards the Government.
The prepare-to-fix-bayonets message serves three further purposes for
Mr Blair, who will have his Clause Four constitutional change in place
next month. If the rank-and-file believe that an election could be
imminent, discipline is easier to impose.
As Blair wants most of his key policies in place by the October party
conference this is an important aspect. Without precisely betraying an
election manifesto, he is seeking broad support for a Labour
Government's intentions on jobs, education, health, housing and
training. Quiet, disciplined, unemotional debate on these subjects is
what he wants from his conference.
The second purpose concerns finance. Labour's coffers are unusually
healthy, building up to about #6m compared with the Tory deficit of
#16m. But elections cost a lot of money and Labour needs more. When
supporters think the chance of power is in the offing, funds start to
pour in.
Thirdly, the autumn election scenario provides a boost to the
''Rolling Rose'' campaign, launched on Tuesday, which is to tour the
country to sell Labour as a user-friendly party. New faces, nice, able
people who can form a government that nobody need be frightened of.
This is the practical spin-off from Blair's decision to make a big
public show of putting his Cabinet-in-waiting on a war footing. (It was
leaked to selected political correspondents on Tuesday night to ensure
that he would get two bites of the publicity apple). Blair has fleshed
it out by assigning new, election-orientated tasks to his key Shadow
Ministers.
Mr Gordon Brown will lead a new strategy team of party officials on
stand-by to repulse Tory attacks and project Labour's economic message.
Mr Robin Cook is to develop and refine policies, identifying ones like
health as vital to election success. There is to be no repetition of the
''Jennifer's ear'' debacle of the 1992 campaign. Deputy leader John
Prescott will join with Blair in supervising a new campaigns committee,
developing regional policy and defining social divisions in Britain.
Whether Mr Blair actually believes that an autumn election is likely
is another matter. I tend to take my cue on this when the Opposition
party starts booking advertising hoardings throughout the country. This
can be expensive, particularly if the election doesn't happen when
predicted (twice in the 1980s) and the money is wasted.
It has been called putting your money where the redundant hoardings
are -- but we haven't quite got to that stage yet. Indeed, the Blair
call to arms may prove counter-productive to his target of an early
General Election. It could startle the Tories sufficiently to reverse
the impression they have given of having a death wish.
Despite the ministerial gaffes of late, there have been signs of the
Tories at last absorbing from the opinion polls and other evidence the
desperate state they are in. The nine Whipless ones are unlikely to
permit their Government to be defeated, even if they do not regain the
Whip. The Ulster Unionists do not like to be rushed into something that
might produce a Labour Government that, at best, is bi-partisan on
Northern Ireland and, at worst, could be more inclined to republicanism.
All Tories want tax cuts to help save their seats, preferably in two
tranches starting next November. If Chancellor Kenneth Clarke does not
make a start this autumn, then real panic could set in. Mr Blair might
then, round about this time next year, seize the initiative on the
timing of the next General Election.

<TEXT>
FORMER Cabinet Minister David Mellor and his wife Judith have
divorced, it was revealed last night.
The couple's decree nisi was granted at the High Court in London on
Tuesday, effectively ending their marriage of more than 20 years.
The move follows the revelation last November of the 46-year-old Tory
MP's relationship with Lady Cobham, a special adviser when he was
Heritage Secretary.
The disclosure put his personal life back in the headlines, more than
two years after the publicity surrounding his affair with actress
Antonia de Sancha, which preceded his resignation.
Mr Mellor survived an attempt to oust him as MP for Putney last week
despite stormy scenes at a constituency meeting. He remained embroiled
in controversy, though, by allegedly describing three of his
constituency critics as ''cretins''.
The Mellors have two children: Anthony, 14, and Freddie, 10.

<HEADLINE>Skye Bridge faces threat of competition from ferry</HEADLINE>

THE Skye Bridge, flagship of the Government's private road building in
Scotland, could face direct competition from the existing ferry service
when it opens in the late summer.
Despite promises to the operators of the bridge, financed by #23m of
private capital, a Government instruction to CalMac to withdraw its
ferry service the day the bridge opens may be impossible to enforce.
There is no doubt that the highly profitable Kyle of Lochalsh-Kyleakin
service will eventually come off, but this could be delayed, perhaps
even by months.
Finely-balanced calculations for the project have always been based on
the ferry's ceasing its operation the day the bridge opens. The
operators would then charge a toll equal to the ferry fare -- at present
#5.20 for a single journey -- making it the most expensive bridge toll
in Europe.
However, it now appears that not enough time has been allowed to
pursue the proper procedures for withdrawing a ferry service by that
time.
Until the passage of the 1993 Railway Act the Scottish Transport
Users' Consultative Committee had the sole right to call public
inquiries into the withdrawal of any ferry service. The Act replaced the
STUCC with the Railway Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland,
which, despite its name, retains responsibilties for ferries.
At last week's meeting of the RUCC it was announced that a letter from
the Scottish Office had been received, saying that the RUCC ''may'' have
lost its power to call inquiries on ferry withdrawals. The committee,
under the chairmanship of Mr Lawrence Kemp, did not agree.
This week, a Scottish Office spokesman indicated that there was now
considerable official confusion over the issue:
The RUCC last week decided to proceed with established procedures,
regardless of this apparent uncertainty. CalMac's managing director, Mr
Colin Paterson, has informed the committee of the intention to withdraw
the service, and the RUCC has in turn asked him to advertise the
proposed withdrawal.
Mr Kemp told the Herald yesterday: ''The proposal would have to be
advertised, explaining the appeal procedure, and allowing sufficient
time for objections to come in. If there were a substantial number of
objections, we would then hold a public inquiry.''
After that, Mr Kemp said, the RUCC would make a recommendation to the
Secretary of State, who would then give his response. Mr Kemp could not
say how long all that would take, but it would be ''a considerable
time''.
One Herald source, however, said: ''They might have to allow three
months for all the objections to come in, so the whole thing could take
nine months.''
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, which
brings together all strands of opposition to the toll bridge, said last
night: ''If there is a consultative procedure, we will be objecting all
right.
''The people of Kyle and Kyleakin are to lose a free service for foot
passengers, apart from anything else. A private monopoly is being
established against the will of the people. We must fight it all the
way.''
