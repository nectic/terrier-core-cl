FRANCES HORSBURGH foresees a dilemma for the Conservatives when the
new water authorities arrive
SCOTTISH Office Ministers have begun to fight back this week against
repeated and damaging claims by their political opponents that a marked
increase in the use of private finance to build large water and sewerage
capital projects will cost local taxpayers dear.
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch has told The Herald
that the objective must be to provide the best possible water at the
least possible cost to the consumer in a period when significant costs
would be incurred whatever was done.
''I am confident we have in place the mechanisms to achieve this'' he
said.
The Government's preferred mechanisms are the increasing use of
''Build, Own and Operate schemes'' (BOOs) commissioned by the three new
water authorities within the Government's Private Finance Initiative.
In this battle for the hearts, minds and pockets of the voters over
water the Government's main protagonists have been Labour-controlled
Strathclyde region which will vanish under the forthcoming council
reorganisation.
Just over a year ago, 1.2 million people in Strathclyde -- an
overwhelming 97% of all those who voted -- said ''No'' in a postal
referendum to the Government's proposals to take water and sewerage
services out of council control.
Strathclyde region's Labour leader Bob Gould hailed the result as
''sensational'' and warned it would be unwise of the Government to
proceed with its plan to set up three new public water authorities.
Predictably the Government paid no attention to that warning from
Strathclyde, although embarrassed Ministers were mustered to pooh-pooh
the result and to suggest perhaps people had voted in this way because
they thought water services were being privatised.
Councils like Strathclyde, and the Labour-led Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities (Cosla), have continued to argue that there was no
need to remove water services from council control in order to meet new
investment levels.
Instead they have claimed all that needed to be done was to relax the
Treasury rules which make council borrowing count against the overall
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR).
Cosla said the major investment needed in water and sewerage schemes
would cost each household just [1/2]p a day more on their council-tax
bills. A spokesman said: ''If there is an accounting problem over the
PSBR then it is a problem of the Government's own making which the
Government itself can readily solve''.
Strathclyde region returned to the fray last October when its leaders
claimed that the method by which the Government hoped to bring in
private finance for new water and sewerage schemes, would result in a
doubling of domestic and business water bills.
An internal study claimed to demonstrate that the BOOs would be far
more expensive for local payers than the traditonal method of financing
by which local authorities borrow money on advantageous terms through
the Public Works Loan Board and repay it over the years from revenues.
So annoyed were the Scottish Office by the publicity the claims
received that then Local Government Minister Allan Stewart went on
record to say that the study ''contained important deficiencies and
ignored some very pertinent facts about BOOs.'' He insisted the schemes
would provide value for money through competition and that this would
stimulate contractors to examine their costs and search for innovative,
low-cost solutions.
Strathclyde's latest chance to shout ''BOO'' in the Government's ear
over its strategy was the recent publication of a updated version of a
report by the Chemical Bank commissioned by the region.
It surveyed 14 commercial and merchant banks' views on the private
finance strategy drawn up by the Scottish Office.
It concluded that this method of bringing in the private sector would
impose ''an excessive and unnecessary'' burden on ratepayers and that it
failed any ''reasonable'' value-for-money test.
However in a detailed rebuttal of the report's conclusions sent to
Strathclyde yesterday Mr Kynoch accused the council of acting in an
alarmist and irresponsible way by translating ''simple and flawed
projections into talk of higher costs for customers.''
Mr Kynoch told the Herald: ''We do need a lot of capital investment
over the next 10 to 15 years. We should be going forward in a spirit of
co-operation and working together which is what I would be seeking. It
is disappointing that Strathclyde have decided to start in this
adversarial way.''
Based on the conclusions of the Chemical Bank report the Labour Party
has claimed in its local election campaign that Scotland's two millon
households will have to pay an extra #234 on water bills to finance BOOs
to build 11 proposed sewerage treatment centres.
Labour has said, that since private builders could not command the low
interest rates available to local authorities extra costs would be
passed on to householders.
Labour's Scottish economic spokesman John McFall insisted the Labour
Party was in favour of working-partnerships between the public and
private sector where appropriate.
But he insisted: ''The BOOs are not so much a public and private
partnership as a case of highway robbery with Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang holding a gun to the heads of Scottish consumers.''
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the BOOs most experts agree that
Scottish water and sewerage charges are going to rise significantly in
the future to help pay for the extra infrastructure investment needed.
Having removed local authorities as a possible scapegoat, the
Government's problem will be to convince a sceptical public that the
increased use of private finance which it is encouraging will deliver a
cheaper and better service.

Miami, Tuesday
A WOMAN was sentenced to 15 years in prison today for allowing her
quadriplegic husband to die from decay.
A judge recounted testimony from medical workers who described Scott
Mickler's condition at his wife's trial: an overpowering stench as he
lay in a bed covered with flesh and body wastes, gangrene so severe that
his toes and heels were falling off.
Cheryl Mickler was convicted at Moore Haven in Florida on February 6
of abuse or neglect of a disabled adult. A quadriplegic since a 1978 car
accident, her husband had won a $3.5m (#2.3m) settlement and she ended
up with $1.5m (#1m) after he died in 1990.
''The defendant's conduct was both extraordinary and egregious,''
Circuit Judge Thomas Reese said when he imposed the maximum sentence
allowed.
Emergency medical workers called to the Mickler house in 1990 found
31-year-old Mickler so badly decayed that his blood pressure and pulse
could not be taken, though he was still alive. His flesh fell away when
they touched it.
Mickler died of massive infection a few hours later in a hospital
emergency room.
Mrs Mickler did not speak before sentencing and showed no reaction to
the sentence, against which her lawyer said she would appeal.
Mrs Mickler had testified at her trial that she did not notice her
husband was rotting from gangrene until she went to turn him over the
night before he died.
Doctors called by her lawyers testified that her severe allergies to
mould and pollutants made her mentally incompetent.--AP.

Bonn, Tuesday
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany will attend Moscow's official
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War
after Russia agreed not to hold a militaristic victory march, officials
said.
Bill Clinton, President Francois Mitterrand of France, and John Major
have all announced they would attend the Russian ceremony after initial
doubts because of Moscow's war in breakaway Chechnya.
The final details of Kohl's trip had still to be worked out and an
official announcement would be made later.
''The chancellor has agreed in principle to go,'' one official said.
He added that Moscow had been informed and Bonn was awaiting a formal
response.
German Government officials in Bonn said Russian President Boris
Yeltsin had decided to hold Moscow's military parade marking VE Day on
May 9 away from the official event on Red Square.
This made it possible for Kohl, who has refused to attend anniversary
ceremonies with victory parades recalling Germany's defeat, to go
without embarrassment.
The officials said that Yeltsin would not attend the military event
but would join Kohl and other Western leaders at a march on Red Square
of War veterans.
The German officials said Moscow had informed Kohl the official
anniversary programme included a wreath-laying at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier in the Kremlin wall and the unveiling of a new monument
for those who died.--Reuter.

Strasbourg
SPAIN yesterday torpedoed a draft deal to end the North Atlantic
halibut war after days of intensive talks in Brussels.
To the dismay of the European Union and Canada, the Spanish -- with
Europe's biggest fishing fleet -- refused to accept a proposed cut in
their quota of the disputed catch. The row, involving the firing of
shots and accusations of piracy, has caused a transatlantic political
rift and divided the EU member states.
Spanish and a few Portuguese boats account for all of the halibut
fishing effort in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, where the Canadians
last month arrested a Spanish freezer ship at gunpoint in international
waters outside Canada's 200-mile limit.
After on-off talks which culminated in the proposed deal yesterday,
both the EU -- which negotiates for Spain -- and the Canadians had high
hopes of a settlement which could have gone for approval tomorrow to a
meeting of European fisheries ministers.
However, when the terms of the proposed deal became known in Madrid,
the Prime Minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, said the government could not
accept them because they would have reduced Spain's share of permitted
catches by 75%.
Even so, negotiators remained optimistic that a solution was still
possible by Thursday. ''Every day we have made some progress,'' said
Jennifer Sloan, a Canadian spokeswoman.
The North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (Nafo) which has
responsibility for managing fishing in the area set a catch limit this
year of 27,000 tonnes to try to save threatened stocks. If the talks
which resumed last night are successful, an agreement could be placed
before EU ambassadors in Brussels today.
Spain's ambassador to the EU, Mr Javier Elorza, reaffirmed a
commitment to finding a settlement and added: ''We're going to have a
further session of negotiations.''
He added: ''We want at least 50% for the Union, that is 13,500
tonnes.'' Spain strongly rejected a Canadian offer of 8000 tonnes
compared with 42,000 tonnes last year when fishing was unrestricted.
An EU spokesman said: ''We made it clear that the share-out of the
quotas must be fair. We think we are being reasonable and would like the
Canadians to be reasonable too. They must try to make a further
effort.''
The draft accord would have more than doubled Canada's share of
Greenland halibut.
Both sides appeared to have overcome obstacles to agreeing a
sophisticated policing system in the area, involving spy satellites and
on-board inspections of catches and nets.

Warsaw, Tuesday
A ROMANIAN airliner made an emergency landing at Warsaw airport today
after receiving a warning of a bomb on board, but police searched the
plane and found nothing.
The British-made Tarom airlines twin-engined BAC 1-11 plane, on a
flight from Bucharest to Copenhagen with 15 passengers and six crew,
resumed its flight to Denmark from Okecie airport.
This was the second bomb scare aboard a Romanian airliner in two days,
and followed the crash of a Tarom Airbus in Bucharest on Friday which
killed all 60 people on board.
Investigators are looking into the possibility that the crash may have
been caused by a bomb. One witness reported seeing an explosion shortly
before the plane came down.
Tarom has had a rash of bomb threats since the crash.
Poland's PAP news agency said the passengers on the flight which
landed in Warsaw were a Briton, seven Romanians, five Swedes, two Danes,
and six Romanian crew.
An airport spokesman said an anonymous caller had telephoned in
Bucharest saying there was a bomb on the flight and the message had been
passed on by radio while the plane was over Poland.

Kiev, Tuesday
PRESIDENT Leonid Kuchma today challenged Ukrainians to modernise their
country by pursuing the market reforms he had launched while the
government he had often criticised was sacked by a discontented
Parliament.
Earlier, MPs threw out the government in an overwhelming vote of no
confidence. Advisers to the president said he would seize the
opportunity to create a team capable of proceeding with change.
It was the first time since independence that a government had been
thrown out on a confidence vote. The new administration will be
Ukraine's fifth of the post-Soviet era.
Kuchma said his reform programme, introduced after three years of
inaction, was yielding its first results. However he acknowledged MPs'
concerns by pledging to eliminate the social injustice inflicted by
post-Soviet economic upheaval.
He also acknowledged that the majority of Ukraine's 52 million people,
cast into poverty by turbulent change and three years of inaction, had
felt none of the benefits of reform.
Kuchma promised to strengthen ties with the West and intensify
co-operation with Russia as Ukraine's main strategic partner.--Reuter.

San Francisco, Tuesday
AN IRISH violinist who couldn't bear to leave her new American
boyfriend behind bolted from her plane just before it left for home.
However Nuala Ni Chanainn left the TWA flight in such a hurry
yesterday that authorities at San Francisco International Airport
suspected she left a bomb behind.
The flight was delayed for 3[1/2] hours while officials searched the
cabin, emptied the belly of the Boeing 767, and examined all the
luggage, using bomb-sniffing dogs.
The 34-year-old musician and her new love were questioned by FBI
agents, the Federal Aviation Administration, and airport security.
She was finally found guilty of nothing more than ''trying to make a
love connection'', said airport spokesman Ron Wilson.
''I guess she was torn between leaving and staying and finally
figured, the hell with my luggage, I'm staying,'' Wilson said.
The flight was bound for New York, then Shannon.
Chanainn, a member of the visiting Macnas theatre group from Galway,
was embarrassed by the incident and regretted the inconvenience she
caused her 200 fellow passengers, said Peter O'Neill, director of the
Irish Arts Foundation.--AP.

Washington, Tuesday
A JURY today found Francisco Duran, a Colorado hotel worker, guilty of
trying to kill President Bill Clinton last October when he sprayed the
White House with bullets. The verdict was unanimous.
After deliberating just four hours, the jury of 10 women and two men
said they found Duran, 26, guilty on all 10 counts of the indictment
which charges him with attempted assassination, assaulting four Secret
Service guards at the White House, and weapons violations.
He could be sentenced to life in prison.
The jury rejected his lawyers' arguments that Duran was insane at the
time of the shooting, and that he was aiming at a powerful mist hanging
over the White House. They agreed with the prosecutors who maintained
that Duran faked mental illness to avoid a lengthy prison term.
Duran waited outside the White House or hours on October 29 before
pulling the weapon from under his trench coat and spraying the front of
the mansion with nearly 30 bullets.
No-one was hurt. President Clinton was in the White House's family
quarters at the time, watching a football game. The Secret Service said
the president never was in any danger.--Reuter/AP.

Atlanta, Tuesday
A BRITON on Georgia's Death Row today lost a desperate bid to avoid
the electric chair when a federal district court judge rejected his
lawyer's plea to stay the execution.
Nicholas Ingram, a 31-year-old whose case has drawn international
attention, is due to be put to death on Thursday night.
US District Judge Horace Ward, in a seven-page decision, rejected the
claim by Ingram's lawyerss that death by electrocution is cruel and
unusual punishment in violation of the US constitution.
The lawyers could now try turning to the circuit court of appeals to
stop the execution, although it was not immediately clear if they
planned to take that step.
Ingram was convicted in 1983 of killing 55-year-old J C Sawyer in a
grisly murder-robbery that netted him #40 and a second-hand lorry.
Out of jail for less than a month and armed with a pearl-handled
.38-calibre pistol, Ingram allegedly forced his way into the Sawyers'
suburban Atlanta home and told Mary Eunice Sawyer that he liked to
torture people.
The 19-year-old then tied the Sawyers to a tree and shot them both in
the head. Mrs Sawyer survived, feigned death, and later ran for help.
Ingram, the son of an American airman who has dual British and US
nationality, was scheduled to die in 1984 but until today had been able
to avoid execution three times through appeals.
Judge Ward, who approved the last appeal in 1989, said this time the
lawyers had not made their case and had failed to establish ''that
Georgia's administration of its electric chair constitutes cruel and
unusual punishment''.
Meanwhile, the case has taken on elements of an international incident
focusing on US practices of capital punishment and Stafford Smith's
allegations that Ingram was drugged with Thorazine during his trial.
Ingram's mother, Anne, asked Prime Minister John Major to intercede in
the case during his visit to the United States this week. He declined.
Tonight Mrs Ingram told reporters she wanted an independent review of
the case, something she had hoped Mr Major would support.
''Not all the facts about Nick's case have come out. They may never
come out but I do know that in two days' time it's going to be too late
for those facts to come out unless something happens,'' Mrs Ingram told
reporters in Georgia today.
''I'm doing exactly what a mother should do,'' she added. ''I'm with
my son because I don't believe wholeheartedly in his guilt.''
Asked if she believes her son is innocent, Mrs Ingram hesitated before
saying: ''He was on drugs and alcohol and he had black-outs. Now, as far
as I know, no-one knows really what happened. But as a mother? And I'm
talking as a mum: No, he did not commit the crimes he's been charged
with.''
The European Parliament also weighed in today in the case, urging
President Clinton to stay the execution and noting Europe's
''abhorrence'' of the electric chair.
Stafford Smith told reporters yesterday that if Judge Ward refused the
stay, he would present new evidence showing that authorities kept Ingram
sedated with Thorazine and that a second assailant was involved in the
crime.--Reuter.

Kizi, Burundi, Tuesday
TERRIFIED villagers spoke today of the way troops and Tutsi gunmen
massacred hundreds of civilians last week in north-eastern Burundi.
''They started killing on a nearby hill and then worked through the
village, killing people mostly with guns,'' said Jonathan Bayuga, 28.
Meanwhile, UN officials said neighbouring Tanzania was expelling
Burundian refugees who thought they had reached safety across the
border.
Accounts of the massacre by residents of Kizi village largely
substantiated reports from aid workers and diplomats that more than 400
Hutus were slaughtered.
They conflicted with a Burundian military spokesman saying he was
aware of only some 20 dead in the Gasorwe region and that the reports of
400 dead were exaggerated.
''The operation started on March 29 with a combined force of Burundian
military and Tutsi Burundi, displaced from nearby camps . . . people
recognised some of the Tutsi displaced,'' said Bayuga.
''When we heard about the killing starting, we ran away through the
bush. But they took away what people they could capture and just killed
them in the bush,'' he added.
''They killed men, women, and children . . . just because they are
Hutus.''
Bayuga said they had found 201 bodies in and around Kizi so far and
buried them. Other villages gave similar accounts.
A spokeswoman for the UN special envoy to Burundi said he had
established that at least 345 people had been slain in four locations in
Muyinga province.
The massacres may have helped trigger an exodus from last Thursday of
50,000 Rwandan refugees stuck in north-east Burundi after fleeing
genocide in their own country.
The Rwandans had headed for nearby Tanzania until Friday, when
Tanzanian authorities closed the border.
Despite an appeal by the UN refugees' Burundi chief, Shelly Pitterman,
Tanzanian officials said that the border closure was final.--Reuter.

James Simpson, 28, walked in the front door of Walter Rossler Co and
shot the owner, his wife, and three workers with a pistol and a revolver
before leaving by the back door. He shot himself behind the building.
Hours before the massacre at a refinery inspection company, 30,000
fans attended the funeral of slain Tejano music superstar Selena, who
was fatally shot at a motel in the town on Friday. The founder of her
fan club has been charged with murder.

Scotland's business rates have at last been harmonised with those
south of the Border. But rating experts and business leaders say that
harmonisation has struck a sour note -- the imposition of ''empty
rates''. Stewart McIntosh reports
A TIME bomb is ticking under Scotland's empty commercial buildings.
The clock started on April 1, the fuses will blow in three months time
on the owners of empty commercial buildings. The Government's
long-standing promise to harmonise non-domestic rates in Scotland with
those in England carried a down side, from now on ''empty rates'' are to
be levied on commercial buildings which are empty for three months.
Important exceptions include empty industrial buildings, those which
have a rateable value of less than #1000, and a variety of other
exclusions such as those which have a building preservation order or are
included on the Schedule of Ancient Monuments.
Rate collectors are bracing themselves for an explosion of anger.
Companies likely to be caught out include those which expanded their
property during the boom, only to find that the recession cut their
business ambitions back down to size. Far-sighted companies which have
geared themselves up with new technology might no longer need all of
their properties, but are unable to dispose of them in the current
market. They, too, will have to pay half rates on their empty premises.
Similar victims will include office space users that have moved out of
outmoded 1960s or Victorian or Georgian period buildings in Glasgow or
Edinburgh, and into modern space. If they have not yet disposed of their
lease or their title in their redundant buildings they will be expected
to pay empty rates. Many firms will be punished for moving into modern
space which is vital for their competitive edge. Forced to carry the
burden of double rentals they will now have to add empty rates on top.
Many people in the property industry consider this an odd way to
guarantee a business sector which can compete on international terms
from modern premises.
Developers and property investors (your pension fund and mine) will be
among the hardest hit as they struggle to find occupants or buyers for
empty buildings in a still-depressed property market. The result will be
a reduction in speculative development.
Business anger at the imposition of empty rates comes at a time when
Scottish Office Ministers could have been congratulating themselves for,
at last, getting Scotland on to a Uniform Business Rate with those south
of the Border. Rating surveyors and business leaders have welcomed
Scotland's UBR of 43.2p, precisely the same as England's after many
years when Scottish businesses paid significantly more than their
counterparts in the south.
While welcoming that aspect of the harmonisation, business leaders and
property professionals are pointing out that England's empty rates could
have been harmonised with Scotland's -- ie, abolished. But it was not to
be.
Empty rates were introduced in England during the 1960s in response to
the Centre Point row where it was alleged that a major building was
being kept empty in order to take advantage of a rising market. Why take
tenants this year at #x per sq ft, when next year the developer could
expect to get substantially more in rental or selling price? The
Federation of Small Businesses is campaigning to have the new imposition
removed forthwith.
Calling on Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch to think again on
the issue, FSB Scottish Secretary Bill Anderson said: ''It is just not
good enough to shrug this off as ''one of the costs of harmonisation''
when we could have harmonised on Scottish procedure. It really is just
squeezing blood out of bricks and mortar.''
The FSB's stance is supported by Matt Rodger of the Engineering
Industries Association in Scotland who said: ''It's a poor show. In the
engineering industry things are bad enough up here without this.
Businesses are on a tightrope, others are surviving but with this extra
burden they will be back on the treadmill again.''
Kenneth Barclay of surveyors James Barr &amp; Son warns that the most
vulnerable companies will be hardest hit: ''ie, companies fighting to
survive by trying to reduce the amount of space they occupy.''
He believes that empty rates have no role in the current market. He
said: ''No-one involved in property, whether as a developer, landlord or
tenant, seriously believes that anyone would deliberately keep
accommodation off the market.''
Many property professionals predict that buildings will be vandalised
by their owners in a bid to avoid empty rates. In England, tactics such
as removing stairwells, ripping out wiring and plumbing, or even the
removal of roofs, have all been used in a bid to render the buildings
unusable and therefore not liable for empty rates.

STRATHCLYDE region is one of the first regions to have issued
Revaluation Notices to businesses -- and some organisations have been
shocked to see their rateable values more than double. Gary Louttit of
surveyors Euan Wallace said: ''The early indications are that commercial
ratepayers are likely to face uplifts in rateable value ranging from
minimal increases up to as much as 150%. It is too early yet to see a
definite pattern or be in a position to analyse the average uplift in
commercial properties throughout Scotland, but what is beyond dispute is
that the news is not all good.''
As a result of the introduction of the Unified Business Rate, some of
the potential increases will be softened. The UBR to apply throughout
Scotland and England from April 1, 1995 until March 31, 1996 has been
set at 43.2p in the pound. This will be subject to alteration locally in
respect of water and sewerage rates, but even with the inclusion of
local water and sewerage rates, the poundage generally will be at a
noticeably lower level than last year's local rate poundage.
While this will alleviate some of the problem, many ratepayers will
rely on the phasing arrangements or transitional relief announced as a
package by Ian Lang to soften the worst effects of the revaluation.
Gary Louttit said: ''For those who are fortunate to see some decrease
in rate repayments in real terms as a result of this revaluation, a word
of warning. It must be borne in mind that the business rate will
increase year by year throughout the lifespan of the revaluation -- and
unless you ensure that the new rateable value placed on your premises
has been properly assessed you will face real increases in rates
payments in future years, at which time it will be too late to lodge an
objection against the new assessment.'' The deadline for lodging appeals
has been set for Scotland as September 15 this year.
Businesses considering an appeal against the new rating assessment
should use a reputable firm of chartered surveyors. Many businesses have
been hit by a recent scam where fly-by-night ''rating consultants''
promise major reductions in rating assessments, but demand money
upfront. Many of these companies then disappear.
Gary Louttit said that his own firm of chartered surveyors received a
tele-sales call from an unwitting rating consultant who did not realise
that he was talking to a rating surveyor.
''Without having seen our property or even being aware what kind of
property we occupy, they said that they could achieve a saving on our
behalf of between 30% and 40% in actual rates payments. Another
interesting revelation was this company's ability to lodge an appeal now
and be in a position to backdate any savings achieved on our behalf for
a period of five years -- a wholly misleading and quite ridiculous
statement,'' said Louttit.
He made an appointment to see their representative but no-one turned
up -- presumably the ''chartered surveyors'' brass plate at the door was
too much even for the brass neck of the ''rating consultant''.

THE opportunities for home-based meat plants to win added value for
lamb exports by carrying out cutting and preparation work in Scotland
have been highlighted by a Scottish Meat Export Initiative (Scotmex)
visit to France.
Such a move would have the double benefit of creating more work for
meat plants in Scotland and offsetting the effects of any enforced
reduction in live exports.
Alan Steven, chairman of Scotmex, and chief executive Martin
Grantley-Smith, met importers, distributors, cutting plants and
retailers to explore the best way forward for Scottish lamb exports to
France.
Stevenson said that they had found indications that at certain times
of the year the UK multiple trade demand was for lamb chops while the
French hypermarkets were looking for leg and shoulder cuts. If the
breaking up of the carcase was carried out here it would be possible to
meet the demands of both markets, said Mr Stevenson.
The opportunities for selling into the French market in that way would
increase as their supermarket system became more organised along British
lines with centralised buying systems, he predicted.
If the French began to follow that British pattern, and Scottish
plants met the demand for individual cuts, there would be increasing
opportunity to capitalise on the Scottish reputation for quality, said
Mr Stevenson. The problem with achieving premium prices at present was
that very little lamb sold in France was identified by country of
origin. Most Scotish lamb exports were purchased by cutting plants and
immediately lost its identity.
''We are keen to see our exporters work more closely with the
distribution chains to retain the Scottish identity, throughout,'' said
Mr Stevenson, who is also chief executive of the Scottish Association of
Meat Wholesalers.

SCOTLAND'S clubs could be forced into one more vote to determine if
yet another league reconstruction is to take place, despite opposition
from the major clubs and the authorities, who have attracted huge
sponsorship since it was decided a year ago to establish the current
four-division set-up for five years.
An attempt by Dundee, one of the architects of the present system, to
harness support for a 16-club top league next season foundered after it
failed to get enough backing to call an emergency general meeting.
However, Airdrie have come up with a plan which would mean a change the
season after next, with promotion and relegation contests still being
valid next year, and that might have to be accepted by the management
committee as a valid proposition to be put on the agenda for the annual
meeting on May 31.
Airdrie's idea is that the current system would prevail again for
another term, at the end of which decisions would be made about
positions in the new set-up, a construction of 16 premier division
sides, 12 first division teams, and 12 second division clubs. Their
proposal was faxed to the League with hours to spare before the agm
deadline, but that makes it no less serious and has forced secretary
Peter Donald and the management committee into a thorough analysis of
the proposal to see if it complies with the rules.
Said Donald: ''Airdrie have submitted a proposal to have the league
reconstructed to a 16-12-12 arrangement for the season after next, and
that would involve teams playing for places in the various leagues next
season.
''We are examining their suggestion in detail to see if it meets the
requirements of the League rules for the annual meeting and at the
moment we are still going through that exercise.''
Donald added that, if the committee find no quarrel with the
legalities of the Airdrie idea, the motion would have to be put before
the 40 clubs at the agm and, at that point, anything is possible.
It may be true that, if Celtic and Rangers oppose it (as they will)
they will have camp followers, fearful of losing the financial bonanza
of two home games a season against each of the Old Firm that goes with
the current top division, but nothing is written in stone when it comes
to voting predilections in the Scottish League.
If the Airdrie proposal is accepted, there will be a great deal of
lobbying to follow, with support for their chairman, George Peat, from
smaller clubs the length and breadth of the country. The major clubs,
who have four votes apiece -- as against two per team in the first
division and one each in the two other leagues -- will still have the
advantage.
But they have been thwarted in the past, notably by the rebellion led
by Dundee and Falkirk a few years ago, and, if it comes to a vote on May
31, will have to fight a rearguard action to make sure the status quo is
maintained.
It may be that the very mention of the subject excites groans in the
football community at large but the rebels, fired by the belief that
many teams will be forced close to bankruptcy if the system is not
altered, seem determined to bring the great debate to a different
conclusion.
DUMBARTON manager Murdo MacLeod yesterday received a welcome boost as
he attempts to lead the club into the first division -- a new two-year
contract.
The Sons are at present four points clear at the top of the second
division.

QPR 0, Blackburn 1
MANAGER Kenny Dalglish last night vowed Blackburn will grind their way
towards the Premiership title if they have to after squeezing a victory,
courtesy of Chris Sutton, with another resolute performance.
Four wins in their last six games will seal success for Blackburn, who
are now eight points clear of Manchester United, and Dalglish said: ''We
have worked hard to get into this position and we are not going to give
it away now.
''We are going to fight and scrap for everything. We would love to
entertain and play, but sometimes you have to grind out results and we
have got another three points.''
QPR manager Ray Wilkins said Blackburn could not yet be crowned
champions and refused to write off one of his old clubs, Manchester
United.''This win puts Blackburn well and truly in the driving seat, but
injuries and suspensions will play a part and Manchester United won't
give up,'' said Wilkins.
The match looked certain to end in a grim, goalless draw until a
blunder after 66 minutes by Alan McDonald presented Blackburn with all
three points. He staggered as he attempted to intercept a Henning Berg
throw-in, Sutton nicked the ball from between his flailing legs and shot
past Tony Roberts for his twenty-second goal of the season.
* GERMAN defender Juergen Kohler struck an equaliser two minutes from
time to rescue a 2-2 draw for Juventus in their UEFA Cup semi-final
first leg at home to Borussia Dortmund.
Kohler showed excellent control to bring the ball down and fire it
past Dortmund goalkeeper Stefan Klos. But that was not the end of the
drama as Juventus defender Moreno Torricelli was then shown the red card
in the final minute for his second bookable offence.
Stefan Reuter earned a seventh-minute advantage for Dortmund, but
Roberto Baggio brought the Italians back on terms from the penalty spot
in the twenty-fifth minute after striker Fabrizio Ravanelli had been
flattened in the area.
Andy Moeller nosed the visitors back in front after 70 minutes with a
superb 25-metre strike, but Kohler then claimed the late leveller.
In the other semi-final, two defensive errors early in the second half
cost Bayer Leverkusen dearly as they were beaten 2-1 at home by Parma.
After Brazilian Paulo Sergio had given the Germans the lead in the
twentieth minute, the Leverkusen defence gave away two soft goals, Dino
Baggio and Faustino Asprilla taking advantage after 48 and 53 minutes.

THE first tee at the King's Course, Gleneagles, is not a spot for the
weak of heart. No matter what time of day you take up position, ready
once more to set off to conquer, there will be a small knot of
spectators, lurking and looking, waiting for the shot with which they
can identify.
It is maybe not quite as imposing as the first at the Old Course,
where one feels the entire R &amp; A are gazing through the windows, but
frightening enough for those whose handicap exceeds the key of the door.
The fairway is wide enough, yet a hook will take you on to a different
course altogether, while a slice may put you back in the Dormie House
from whence you have just emerged.
On Saturday afternoon I waited with growing dread to play off at
Gleneagles in the company of the Scottish rugby World Cup squad. True,
it helped when one of our most accomplished forwards -- names are being
withheld until after South Africa -- hit his tee-shot on to the
eighteenth green, then played the wrong ball for his second.
The starter was friendly, telling me how he was a faithful reader of
this journal, and he was sure I was going to have a wonderful round. But
the presence of the lady in the headscarf definitely added to the
tension.
My nerves were not calmed knowing that my drive would be examined by
HRH The Princess Royal. When I proceeded to hit the ball all of 15 yards
-- on the right line, of course -- there were sounds of a muffled laugh.
The second did not go all that much further, either.
It reminded me of dear old Chic Murray having a complete air-shot in a
pro-am and concluding, in a stage whisper, that ''they were right when
they said this was a bloody difficult course.''
What optimists we are. For several months we leave the pencil bag in
the boot of the car, sharing space with the socks that were soaked on
the November outing, then we roll up in April, have a couple of vague
swishes and expect to hit the ball straight down the middle.
At one of the short holes on Saturday, the green was a kind of mound
in the middle of scrubland. Two of our four chipped over it, down the
other side, back to where they had come from -- and would be there yet
had they not shouted surrender. My partner and I won the sixth with a 9.
For reasons which entirely escape me, and every professional with whom
I have ever been paired, I receive quite a number of invitations to play
in pro-ams and sponsors' tournaments. These events are more dangerous
than hang-gliding through the Rockies and ought to carry a health
warning.
At Gullane, in one such happy competition, a member of my quartet
putted from the edge of a bunker and promptly fell into the sand. As he
did so, his ball disappeared into the hole.
At the first at Old Prestwick a man from the Gambia with whom I was
paired smacked his drive on to the railway line. A few moments later, to
our horror, we saw him lining up his second from between the tracks.
My partner at Luffness hit his initial tee-shot on to the clubhouse
roof, and I caused great consternation to a bus driver by hooking on to
the main road at the fifth. By his gesture I took it that this was the
second time something like this had happened to him.
Best of all, at very up-market Muirfield, a brewing executive of my
acquaintance shanked his first shot, very nearly decapitating the
starter, who had just given him such a stirring introduction. It can
happen to anyone.
Crowds who come to pro-ams are not always the most knowledgeable of
golf fans. They expect the ams to be able to hit it straight, which is
why they are regularly felled by such as Spiro Agnew and ex-President
Bush.
Bruce Forsyth, a golf fanatic, relates how, in the middle of a
tournament, a man asked him if he would autograph a ball for him.
''Sure,'' replied the entertainer, whereupon the chap picked up the one
Brucie was playing and said: ''Sign here!''
What we should all do, of course, before we dare show our swings in
public, is to take a lesson from the pro. The man at our club is a
saint, carefully reconstructing my lunges into something with a chance
of connecting at regular intervals.
For a short, but turbulent time, the late, great Eric Brown was the
teaching professional for Edinburgh Corporation at the Braid Hills
course. A pupil arrived one evening and proceeded to hit a stream of
balls to left and right.
''What,'' he implored, ''do you think I should do?''
''I think you should take up bloody cricket,'' replied Eric as he made
off to the clubhouse.
Why do we put ourselves through such agonies instead of staying
slumped in front of the small screen watching the US Masters from
Augusta? I'll tell you why; because the hackers can still hit shots that
are as good as any professional's.
They may be only one among 100, but they still stick in the memory. I
would love to tell you that such a stroke came from my round at
Gleneagles, but the three others would clipe on me.
There was, however, a Scotland winger, Wogan or some name like that,
who hit an iron 180 yards to within two feet of the pin at the
eighteenth. Fluke, we all said.

GREGOR Townsend, the Scotland centre, will be out of rugby for a
minimum of four months, but may escape surgery if he responds to
treatment. However, should the Gala player fail to make progress, an
operation -- and consequent 12-month lay-off -- will almost certainly be
required.
Townsend, who sustained a knee injury 10 days ago against Hawick in a
national league match, underwent examination in Edinburgh's Princess
Margaret Rose hospital yesterday. An arthroscopic probe revealed ''a
complete rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee,''
according to a statement from the Scottish Rugby Union.
Consultant Donald McLeod, the SRU's honorary medical advisor -- but
not the surgeon in charge of Townsend's treatment -- confirmed that the
player had escaped the worst-case scenario, requiring instant surgery.
''I am not the expert in this instance, but we believe the injury may
respond to an intensive programme of well superised rehabilitation over
the next four months,'' said McLeod.
''It may settle down with a good programme of physiotherapy exercise.
However, if it should keep giving way, it would require an operation.
There is no way of telling at this stage.''
Posterior cruciate ligament damage ended the international careers of
stand-off John Rutherford and Herald columnist John Beattie. More
recently, advances in treatment techniques allowed the football career
of Rangers Ian Durrant to be saved.
Scotland captain Gavin Hastings, with whom Townsend was so effective
in attacking moves this season, said yesterday: ''Losing such a key
member of the Scotland team is a tremendous blow. There is simply no
other way of describing it.
''I feel very sorry for Gregor. He really has been bedevilled with
injury. We as a back division played very well this season, and there is
no doubt that Gregor contributed immensely to our confidence. But his
loss won't dent our overall confidence. There is no point in looking
back now. We simply have to get on with the show.''
Scotland's coach, Douglas Morgan, added: ''I have criticised Gregor in
the past, but this season he has come on remarkably. It is therefore all
the more disappointing that he won't be with us in South Africa.''

THE press is not yet out of the woods over demands for legislation on
privacy despite achievements in self-regulation, chairman of the Press
Complaints Commission Lord Wakeham warned last night.
In a speech at the British Press Awards, he said the establishment of
the commission by a diverse and fiercely-competitive industry was ''a
logistical and political triumph''.
''The development of the code of practice in the years since then, and
its consistent and effective application by editors and the staff of the
commission, is something of which I have been immensely impressed,'' he
said.
''Mighty though these achievements are, however, we are not out of the
woods quite yet.''
Since the Calcutt report on the conduct of the press, the
self-regulatory system had undergone unprecedented levels of scrutiny,
he said.
This was at a time when the commission was ''sorely tested'' in its
handling of allegations about a number of extraordinary stories.
The Sunday Times Insight team, which exposed the cash-for-questions
affair, won two British Press Awards.
Journalists from the paper posed as businessmen to offer payments in
return for questions to Ministers. Tory MPs David Tredinnick and Graham
Riddick may be temporarily banished from the Commons after the
cross-party Privileges Committee yesterday recommended suspensions.
The newspaper was also reprimanded by the committee, which suggested
its conduct be examined by the PCC.
The paper said the two awards, Team Journalism of the Year and
Exclusive of the Year, made Insight the first journalistic team to
receive two accolades in the 25-year history of the awards.
Other awards: Young Journalist of the Year: Peter Jinks, Freelance.
Foreign Reporter: Robert Fisk, The Independent and Independent on
Sunday. Photographer of Year: Simon Townsley, Sunday Times. Columnist of
Year: Andrew Marr, The Independent. Reporter of Year: Gary Jones, News
of the World. Newspaper of Year: Daily Mail.

A MAN said to have an addiction to driving was jailed yesterday for
his eighth and ninth offences of driving while disqualified.
At Aberdeen Sheriff Court, unemployed Paul McKinnon, 32, described as
a prisoner in Aberdeen, appeared on indictment and admitted two charges
of driving while disqualified, two of driving without insurance, one of
drink driving and a related bail offence.
Depute fiscal Miss Fiona Murray told the court McKinnon was banned
from driving for life at Inverness Sheriff Court last July for his
seventh offence of driving while disqualified.
On October 28 last year, police officers spotted him driving a Ford
Sierra car in a Huntly street. Seeing the police vehicle McKinnon got
out of the car and walked away. A watch was kept on the car and he later
returned and attempted to unlock it. He was arrested then released on
bail.
On December 27 last year McKinnon was spotted driving in an erratic
manner in Aberdeen, using a Montego car he had borrowed for a test
drive, and was arrested. The drink driving offence then came to light.
Describing McKinnon's record as ''appalling'', defence agent Mr George
Mathers said his client accepted he had no business to be driving at
all. McKinnon could not resist the temptation to drive the car in
Aberdeen. Mr Mathers said McKinnon appeared to have an ''addiction'' to
driving vehicles.
Stating that he had a duty to protect the public, Sheriff Alexander
Jessop described McKinnon's record as ''deplorable'', jailed him for 15
months and disqualified him from driving for life.
He also ordered McKinnon to serve the remaining 14 weeks and three
days of his previous sentence, from which he had been released early on
licence.

THE B-listed Fountain Business Centre building in Coatbridge,
Lanarkshire, was damaged by fire yesterday. It took 22 firefighters 90
minutes to bring the blaze at the 93-year-old former Mines Rescue
station under control. The fire, thought to have been caused by an
electrical fault, started about 4am.

THE development of the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine as one of
the country's major tourist attractions has received a major boost.
A funding package of #1.6m has been put together to enable the latest
stage of the museum's development to go ahead with a planned completion
by the summer of next year.
The plan centres on the Linthouse building, which was taken from its
former home at a Govan shipyard and rebuilt down the Clyde at Irvine.
The stone and glass engineering shed will house major exhibits
including the Marquis of Bute's rowing galley from 1818, as well as
working machinery and history displays.
Mr Jim Tildesley, director of the Scottish Maritime Museum, said:
''This is a huge step forward for us and perhaps the most important
stage in the 12 years of growth which the museum has had.
''The Linthouse building is an exhibit in itself in that it is one of
the last remaining examples of Victorian shipbuilding architecture. It
offers us 40,000 square feet of space to develop themes and exhibits
which we can change regularly to encourage visitors to come back.''
The initial plan is to use about a quarter of the floor space for
exhibits and workspace as well as a restaurant and shop. The museum is
unique in that it is a working enviroment in which trainees learn
traditional skills of ship repair and boat building.
The stage of development between 1996 and 1998 will cost almost #2m
and application has been made to the National Lottery fund as well as
more traditional funding sources.
Financial support for this year's work came from Irvine Development
Corporation, Enterprise Ayrshire and the European Regional Development
Fund.
Mr Ian Downs, chief architect for IDC and chairman of the museum's
management committee, said: ''This is a very exciting time for us and
comes at just the right time as we complete new housing at the harbour
and see leisure and catering improving all the time.
''The harbour is coming to life.''

BRITISH dairy farmers must be internationally competitive in terms of
both quality and cost efficiency, said John Moffitt, chairman of the new
Milk Development Council, in London yesterday.
To help the industry achieve these targets the council proposes to
spend #3m of its projected #5m annual budget in funding research and
development programmes. It hopes this expenditure will be matched by
support for commercial and research organisations and by cash from
Brussels.
The first priority will be to create a database of research work
already in progress to avoid duplication of effort, Mr Moffitt told a
news conference. This will be followed by consultation with the industry
leading to the publication of a research and development strategy
document in the autumn.
About #750,000 will be allocated to the National Dairy Council, the
consumer promotion body, which now has a wider Great Britain role
following the collapse of the Scottish Dairy Council. Mr Moffitt said it
was vital the industry continued to support this body which presented
its case to the public and to schools.
David Balfour, Chief Executive of the NDC, said there may have to be a
change of name to avoid confusion arising from the similar initials. The
MDC title cannot be changed as it is laid down in legislation.
MDC cash, funded by a VAT-free statutory producer levy set at 0.04p
per litre against a mamximum set by Government of 0.05p, will also be
used to provide a free breeding statistical service for producers: to
continue publication of the annual Dairy Facts and Figures; and to take
over some of the activities of the residuary Milk Marketing Board.
The remainder will be used to improve communications within the
industry and to get the various technical and development messages
across to producers.

<HEADLINE>Remote data entry via telephone impresses Committee urges creation of computerised register</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A RECOMMENDATION that the Ministry of Agriculture should assess the
costs of establishing a UK national cattle database -- with the latest
information being fed in from farm-based computers -- has been made by
the House of Commons Agriculture Committee.
The committee say they were impressed by a system of remote data entry
via the telephone system which operates in the Netherlands. Information
currently contained in movement books could be regularly updated on a
computer system -- on a daily basis if necessary.
The existing system of movement records on farms is clearly in need of
reform, says the committtee report. ''We were dismayed to find the
general air of resignation in Ministry of Agriculture and in the farming
organisations about the poor quality of farmers' statutorily required
records. We urge the government to study the problem closely and
recommend that, at the very least, every animal movement book on every
farm in the UK should have an identical format.''
The system of checking movement records is also criticised. Currently
it is assumed that a farmer's records are correct until they are found
to be otherwise, says the committee. This will normally occur when the
records are most needed.
''We have been told that farmers' records constitute the main flaw in
the animal tracking system. Farmers do not always maintain the records
they are legally required to keep as accurately or completely as they
should. Unfortunately, by the nature of the system, a farmer's failure
to keep the correct records will only come to light when there is a
problem.''
The committee accept that the justification for a central database for
disease purposes under current circumstances may be slim -- but say that
attitude takes no account of disease problems which may emerge in the
future.
''The disease tracing problems we have already studied, including
those involving foot and mouth disease, sero-positive cattle and Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy illustrate both the dynamic nature of animal
disease and the unpredictability of the problems the livestock industry
must face. One never knows in advance how important it will be to
establish the life history of animals which may have harboured disease
in a 'silent state' over long periods. One never knows how important it
may be to establish the familial relationship between dam and offspring
where the disease in question is passed on, in some form, from one
generation to another.''
It is evident that no single use to which a national database might be
put would justify the high costs of its establishment, but the sum of
uses, as time goes by, will make the case increasingly compelling,
states the report. The commitee recommend that the government should
provide a proportion of the funding but envisage that the majority of
the cost should be met by the industry.
On the issue of cattle identification and tagging the committee
recommend that a system of mandatory double-tagging -- one tag on each
ear -- should be introduced. Consideration should also be given to
allowing a system of numbering where the official number and a
management number can be recorded on the same tag.
Double tagging, they suggest, would reduce the risk of a tag being
accidentally lost and agriculture minister William Waldegrave had agreed
it would increase the integrity of cattle identification in the UK.

Partick Thistle 3, Hearts 1
WITH one bound they were free, off the bottom of the premier table for
the first time in four months. Is there no end to Thistle's cheek?
Hearts would tell you with some passion that there is not.
The bottom team had not been seriously in the contest for more than an
hour when 39-year-old Henry Smith, deputising for injured keeper Craig
Nelson, made a dreadful mess of a simple save and allowed Steve
Pittman's shot to go into the net to level the scores.
That galvanised the Firhill workers and from then on there was only
one side playing for keeps.
In that first half Hearts had appeared comfortable with the goal
scored by John Millar early on. But once the locals went into overdrive,
Hearts had nothing left to offer. Rod McDonald shot Thistle into the
lead and Derek McWilliams added No.3 before the end.
Now Thistle are above Aberdeen and closing in on the rest. They can't
really be going to escape, can they?
Manager John Lambie warned, however, that Thistle must keep their feet
on the ground. ''I thought that in the first half we were a disgrace and
shocking, but they didn't capitalise on their 1-0 lead. We deserved to
win in the second half and we got a break with Pittman's goal, although
it did take a heck of a bend.
''We have to keep our feet on the ground because if we think that's
it, we're in for problems. We're still in trouble but this brings a
couple of teams nearer us.''
His opposite number, Tommy McLean, said: ''We were well in control of
the game until we lost that goal. Individual mistakes cost us the game.
I would have expected my goalkeeper to save that first goal.''
Thistle's game plan was knocked awry early, since Hearts took the lead
within seven minutes. Thistle were remarkably lax in their own goal area
when David Hagen's cross from the left reached the danger zone. Neither
keeper Nicky Walker nor two of his defensive colleagues offered any real
challenge to Millar when he rose to head comfortably high into the net
from about eight yards.
Thistle tried to come back quickly but found the Hearts defence, with
the powerful Craig Levein and Dave McPherson at its centre, very
difficult to out-manoeuvre.
However, as they neared half-time, Thistle suddenly raised their game
and Foster did well to turn on a cross from Ian Cameron and hit the ball
firmly but over the bar.
That encouraged the home gang, and there was noise about the old
stadium for the first time.
Hearts kept Robertson inside at the break, bringing on Kevin Thomas,
who soon was booked for deliberately handling the ball.
Thistle made a substitution in 54 minutes, Alex Taylor coming on for
Tommy Turner. They had more of the play by now, but they made few real
chances.
When the Jags' breakthrough did come, in 63 minutes, it was down to a
blunder by Smith. When the ball broke out to Pittman following a corner
on the right, the full back hit it well enough towards goal, but Smith
was perfectly placed to grasp the ball to his body. Instead, he allowed
it to bounce off his hand to land behind him and over the line.
Hagen was booked for a foul on McKee as a game that had been
relatively tame suddenly sprang to life.
The Maryhill lot were now on the march and it was no big surprise when
they went in front after 74 minutes. Foster did the leading-up work,
laying the ball to his right for McDonald, who beat Colin Miller
cleverly before touching the ball past the outrushing Smith.
With 11 minutes left both sides threw on subs, Hearts replacing Miller
with Gary Mackay and Thistle putting on Roger Eli for McDonald.
It made no difference, nothing was getting in the way of a Partick win
now. They came up with their third goal two minutes later. This time it
was a cross from Albert Craig which set up the chance for McWilliams to
head home.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, McKee, Pittman, Watson, Welsh, Turner,
McDonald, Craig, Foster, Cameron, McWilliams. Substitutes -- Taylor,
Eli, Cairns.
HEARTS -- Smith, Wishart, Miller, Levein, Bett, McPherson, Colquhoun,
Hamilton, Robertson, Millar, Hagen. Substitutes -- Thomas, Mackay,
O'Connor.
Referee -- J McCluskey (Stewarton).

SCOTTISH athletics at the grass roots were revealed yesterday as major
beneficiaries of the #4m which TSB are pumping into the sport.
The Scottish Schools Athletics Association is to receive #104,000
during the next two years, and the sponsors have also agreed to back the
streamlined Thistle Awards scheme with #25,000 per year for two years,
with the contract renegotiable thereafter.
The awards have been made much easier to manage. A personal-best
measuring system allows participants to compete against pre-set targets
and against one another on an equal basis, not unlike a golf handicap.
Every secondary school has been circulated with details of the revamped
programme, as have details of the equivalent for under-11s, The Magic
Mac Award.
A new UK rankings scheme to be launched next month will involve tables
comparing performances in different events. It will cover some 6000
British athletes and will be the largest ranking scheme in the world.
* THE Ethiopian government has dismissed the whole of its national
athletic federation, accusing officials of failing in their
responsibilities.
The journey to last month's world cross-country championships in
Durham took more than 60 hours. Athletes had to pool their own money for
hotel accommodation at an unplanned stop-over in Athens, but there was
no money for food.
Despite having arrived at midnight, just 12 hours before the start,
the Ethiopians won two individual golds and one silver, and were
runners-up for two team titles. Four runners sought political asylum in
Britain following the event.

WHITE and GOLD
ROSINA Mae can make the most of ideal conditions today to land her
fourth success of the season in the Thrill of Ownership Handicap Hurdle
at Ascot.
Lynda Ramsden's mare was a decent performer over long trips on the
Flat and has given every indication this term that her future is as a
long-distance hurdler.
She managed one third place from three outings at around two miles at
the start of the campaign, but has not looked back since being sent over
further. She started the winning sequence at Edinburgh over two and a
half miles and then notched another victory over course and distance,
beating Gillan Cove by three and a half lengths.
After a third to Tronchetto back at Edinburgh, she made a return to
the winner's enclosure at Newcastle last time, when proving too strong
for Mary Reveley's Young Ty.
Held up during the early stages, she closed on the leaders early in
the home straight and eventually took up the running after the final
obstacle, having two and a half lengths to spare at the line.
The most significant feature of the Newcastle race was that it came on
fast ground, which is likely to suit Rosina Mae more than it will her
opponents.
John Gosden's strike rate at the moment is nothing short of
phenomenal, the Stanley House trainer having sent out 10 winners from 16
runners so far in 1995. Gosden can repeat Linney Head's success in last
year's Galphay Conditions Stakes at Ripon with Torrential.
Unraced at two, the son of American stallion Gulch created a very
favourable impression on his debut at Doncaster at the end of last
month, running on strongly to beat Silver Sting by a length and a half.
That win came over seven furlongs and Torrential, who is sure to
improve over this nine-furlong trip, can make it two victories from two
starts.

STANLEY Leisure is buying the two Berkeley Casinos in Edinburgh and
Glasgow which will double its casino interests in Scotland at a cost of
#7.7m.
The deal is conditional upon Gaming Board consent an the transfer of
the licences from the present owners County Properties and Developments
at Licensing Board meetings to be held in Glasgow on June 23 and in
Edinburgh on June26.
Stanley has in addition 26 of its 424 betting shops in Scotland. As it
already has 19 casino licences, there should be no regulatory problems.
Chairman Leonard Steinberg said that he was very pleased to get into
the City. The Glasgow casino in Sauchiehall Street is very busy and the
drop or average amount lost by the punter was higher than in the
Edinburgh casino which is situated behind the Caledonian Hotel. The
opportunities in Glasgow ''are exciting.''
The two casinos being acquired made net trading profits of #645,000,
before depreciation charges of #172,000 in the 11 months to February.
They will be immediately earnings enhancing to Stanley once the
necessary consents have been made. One advantage is that both are in
excellent condition on freehold sites.
Stanley shares closed unchanged at 389p and just 1p short of the all
time peak.

THE Churchill Insurance Women's World Indoor Bowls Championship began
in Cumbernauld yesterday when both the home players, Jan Woodley and
Joyce Lindores, began their section matches with convincing victories.
There were also wins for former champions Margaret Johnston and Mary
Price.
Woodley, the holder, started well in her clash with Ireland's Mary
Tosh, taking the opening set 7-3, but Tosh squared the match with a 7-4
margin. Woodley, however, dominated the decider, winning it 7-1.
World outdoor gold medallist Lindores, from Tweedbank, had a
comfortable straight-sets win over Julie Davies, from Wales, by 7-4,
7-1.
Ballymoney's Johnston, winner of the inaugural event in 1988 and again
the following year, was pushed to the limit before scraping home 7-6 in
the deciding set against Irish team-mate Pat Smyth, who took the opener
7-2. Johnston coasted to a 7-0 whitewash in the second before edging
through in the decider.
England's Price, winner in 1991 and beaten finalist twice since,
notched up a 7-6, 7-2 win over Welsh champion Doreen Rowlands.
The overseas players suffered mixed fortunes, with New Zealand's
Marlene Castle beating Guernsey's Anne Simon 2-7, 7-4, 7-2 but Canada's
Margaret Fettes lost 5-7, 6-7 to the other Guernsey player, Carol Le

AFTER several volatile trading sessions the dollar recovered some
composure. It was higher than the German mark but was lower than the
Japanese yen. Several rounds of intervention by the Bank of Japan
overnight lifted the dollar off its post-war low point of 85.55 yen.
This followed concerted support from the US Federal Reserve on Monday.
There seems to be a collective will to support the dollar by central
banks across the world which can see the domestic problems caused by
their own soaring currencies.
The President of the European Monetary Institute yesterday called for
stability policies to counter the turbulence in the currency markets but
rejected calls for the re-introduction of capital controls.
As the pressure on the dollar eased it took the chance to move higher
against the pound to $1.6017, a gain of almost 1[1/2] cents on its
overnight level. The pound also lost out to a strong mark, dipping to
DM2.2179. Sterling's trade weighted index eased by 0.2 to 84.8.

SHONA Robertson completed a clean sweep of all three titles at the
British Land British National Ski Championships yesterday in France,
where she won the junior Super G on a difficult course.
English team member Angus Shedden took the men's junior Super G in
which six of the top 10 competitors skied out at virtually the same
point.
Once again the transition from the fast, open flat to the final steep
pitch caught out the top skiers. One after another the problems came,
and even the British Team seniors -- James Ormond, Alain Baxter and
Spencer Pession, who took first, second and third respectively in the
open FIS race -- lost time there.
Robertson finished six tenths of a second clear of 15-year-old Sophie
Ormond, who added all three Junior 1 (under 17) titles to her Victrix
Ludorum award at last week's senior British event.
While there is no junior overall title, both Michal Pilarski (Falkirk)
and Shona Robertson topped the individual standings in the team
championship. The team title was retained by the Aberdeen team --
Robertson, Pilarski, Tessa Pirie, Caroline Wright, Mark Reilly and Pual
Anthony Cairns. Results:
Super G: Women -- 1, S Robertson (Aberdeen) 1-27.52; 2, S Ormond
(Grand Bornand) 1-28.22; 3, T Pirie (Aberdeen). Men: 1, A Shedden

OPERATING buses may not sound the most glamorous of businesses but the
industry is one of the busiest around when it comes to mergers and
acquisitions.
Now Aberdeen-based GRT, which also runs buses in central Scotland, is
set for a #265m merger with Badgerline, whose stronghold is southern
England. The merger would create the second-largest bus company behind
market leader Stagecoach. The combined bus fleet will number 5600.
For once there is no threat to jobs in the get-together. GRT employs
3700 and Badgerline 10,700 and Moir Lockhead, chairman of GRT,
categorically ruled out any compulsory redundancies, though some jobs
would go through natural wastage. Rather, he said, the merger would
improve job security as employees would become part of a stronger group.
Both companies are at pains to emphasise that it is a genuine merger
of two free parties, not a takeover. It will be effected through a
scheme of arrangement whereby shareholders will receive shares in a new
company, FirstBus.
GRT holders will receive 1.9023 FirstBus shares for every GRT share
and for Badgerline it will be a straight one-for-one swap. GRT holders
will end up with 36.4% of the merged group and Badgerline 63.6%, the
proportions being in line with their companies' relative
capitalisations.
Mr Lockhead will be chief executive of FirstBus and Trevor Smallwood,
the Badgerline chairman, will be executive chairman. The group will
continue to operate in a decentralised manner as it is believed only
local managers know their particular market. The present operating names
will be retained. They include Lowland, Mairs, Kirkpatrick, and Midland
Bluebird.
GRT will bring its employee involvement into the combined group. It
has an employee director, Bob Barclay, who will have the same role in
FirstBus. There will also be a employee share option scheme (ESOP)
absorbing 5% of profits, in line with GRT's present scheme.
Badgerline includes PMT and Rider in the north of England but its main
strengths are in southern England. It may seem strange that two
companies operating at each end of Britain should be joining forces,
particularly given that the chairman will be based in Bristol and the
chief executive in Aberdeen.
But both companies insist they will derive significant economies of
scale from joint purchasing. Together they are spending #40m a year on
new buses plus #55m on fuel and spares. Then there will be savings in
having a single stock market listing and in avoiding duplication in
management offices. Another advantage of the merger will be to improve
geographical spread, reducing the risk of being caught out by varying
economic conditions.
GRT has one of the highest operating efficiencies in the industry
because, as Mr Lockhead explained, they focused early on getting costs
under control following privatisation. Its system of ensuring each
operating company reaches a benchmark of performance has helped raise
margins to 14.7% and this system will be applied to Badgerline, whose
margins are lower at 10.1%.
The aim is to raise FirstBus margins to the higher level over three to
five years. For its part, Badgerline has particular exertise in
group-level trend analysis techniques to monitor costs and efficiency.
Its fleet is also slightly younger at an average of under nine years
against 10 for GRT.
Financially GRT's cash position is better, while Badgerline is
stronger in net assets because as it has spent more on new vehicles. The
bus industry is usually highly geared as it has to spend constantly on
new buses and acquisitions have meant goodwill being written off.
FirstBus will start at 210% but this is expected to fall rapidly to 150%
and interest cover is 4.5.
GRT's operations include networks in Leicester, Northampton, Norwich
and Ipswich and there is only a single slight overlap with Badgerline in
Ipswich. So no problems with the Office of Fair Trading are expected.
Mr Smallwood and Mr Lockhead have known each other through their
industry association for some and the impetus for the merger derived
from this and the two have been talking since before Christmas.
While there are some clear economies of scale it is hard to see these
are overwhelming and likely to make a significant improvement in
customer service. It is possible GRT found itself vulnerable in its
position as seventh in the industry league table with a 3.7% market
share.
Now GRT has indicated its willingness to join forces with another
company it is possible it could attract a predator. But it is already
highly rated in the sector and any bid would have to be agreed because
half the shares are in the hands of directors, managers and employees.
The price of agreement would inevitably be very high. Size is probably
sufficient protection against a bid for Badgerline.
Directors and senior executives hold 30% of GRT, while employees and
the ESOP hold 20%. Shares in the ESOP are divided equally between all
staff who have been with the group for more than six months.
Another uncertainty in the merger is how the chairman and chief
executive will divide their responsibilities, given that each has been
heading their own company up to the present. Any friction will undermine
the advantages of merging.
Once the merger is completed, FirstBus will in its turn be on the
lookout for further acquisitions. Despite the activity in the industry
35% of the market remains outside the major companies. FirstBus has an
advantage in that GRT was originally a buyout of a municipal-owned
business while Badgerline was part of the National Bus Company.
So it has experience of both forms of previous ownership. Opportunites
are getting fewer, particularly given the possible monopoly problems,
though it is an industry with a low cost of entry for a small local
operator.
Apart from acquisitions, FirstBus will consider diversification into
rail. Both GRT and Badgerline have pre-qualified to be
franchise-holders. Overseas opportunities are also being evaluated.
Both companies are growing fast, with Badgerline's 1994 profits up
142% at #16.7m, though underlying earnings per share were a more modest
12.5% ahead. GRT is estimating profits for the year ending last month up
82% at #8m, with earnings per share were 36% ahead. It intends to pay a
final dividend of 3p making a total of 4.4p. FirstBus would have paid
4.5p had it been in existence for 1994/95.
FirstBus has set itself the target of being the strongest operator in
the industry, providing high quality services at prices customers can
afford. These are laudable aims but while concentration in the industry
may benefit shareholders, it remains to be seen whether it will really
be to the advantage of consumers.

THE late withdrawal of Ireland from this weekend's inaugural A
internationals will not deflect Derek Ritchie from his quest to prove
that he is worth a recall to the full Scottish squad.
Ritchie, professional at the David Lloyd Centre, was left out of this
season's Scottish set-up on disciplinary grounds following team manager
Pat Nicol's verdict that he had given less than total commitment to the
Scottish cause at last year's European championships.
However, he has been named in the Scottish Select side for this
weekend's encounter -- and the opening match on Friday is against a
Scottish squad team managed by Nicol.
With England having declined the invitation to take part, and Ireland
having absentmindedly arranged their European championship trials for
the same weekend, two Welsh teams will battle it out with the two
Scottish line-ups for supremacy in both the men's and women's events. A
vintage women's championship is also taking place, and it will include a
side from Ireland.
Scotland's leading juniors -- Lisa McKenna, Gail Davie, Neil Dickson,
Gavin Grant, Colin Hamilton and sister Laura -- will also be in
international action on Friday in the European championships in Israel.
McKenna, seeded 5/8 in the individual event, gained a boost this week
by signing a sponsorship deal with a Glasgow company, John Watson
Printing and Design, and she hopes to repay their faith with a medal in
Tel Aviv.
The 17-year-old meets French girl Aurelie Yong in the opening round
and is seeded to get through to meet England's Janie Thacker in the
quarter-finals.

THE cost of gearing up for the expected surge in sales in 1995 has
resulted in Trafficmaster increasing its losses from #845,000 to #1.31m
last year on turnover up by 25% to #1.03m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Capital expenditure on extending the sensor network on the motorway
and trunk roads as well as new product development amounted to #2m and
will continue at this level for the first half of the current year
before falling back.
The company, under the chairmanship of Sir James McKinnon, has its
products for sale or rental in around 2000 retail outlets and it is on
schedule for a mass-market launch in August. The Trafficmaster plug-in
model for cars is expected to result in 5000 new subscribers in the
three months after launch which compares with the total of 3000 acquired
in the last three years.
However, it will not be until next year that the benefits of the
expected rising subscription revenues will substantially exceed launch
and promotional costs.
Trafficmaster gives the motorist real time information on traffic
conditions for the whole of the UK motorway network and 406 miles of
trunkroad to enable advance route planning to avoid congestion.

LLOYDS Bank has sold its 4.6% stake in Standard Chartered for #127m
and ends a saga which began in April 1986 when Lloyds staged a hostile
#1167m takeover bid that was eventually frustrated by three white
knights.
The buying of Standard Chartered shares in the market by Hong Kong
businessman Y K Pao, entrepreneur Robert Holmes a Court of Australia and
Tan Sri Khoo of Malaysia resulted in Lloyds receiving acceptances for
its offer which was worth the equivalent of 187.5p. Tan Sri Khoo remains
the largest StanChart shareholder with a 15% holding worth #424m.
The 43.8 million shares were placed by brokers Hoare Govett at 290p
with 35 institutions.
Lloyds profits will be boosted this year by about #82m as a result but
this will be treated by the City as an exceptional item.
Market reaction was muted with StanChart easing 5p to 294p while
Lloyds firmed 8p to 622p.
The move comes as little surprise as in recent years Lloyds has made
little mention of the holding which seemed to have become something of
an embarrassment as it had no strategic value.
It was also an unexciting investment in that Hong Kong and other Far
East countries oriented StanChart cut its dividend from the equivalent
of 8.75p to 5p in 1990 and did not begin restoring the position until
1993. Even last year the payout was still just 8p.
Chief executive Sir Brian Pitman said that the initial holding was
acquired in 1986 when Lloyds Bank made an offer to acquire Standard
Chartered. It was increased in 1988 by subscribing in full for a rights
issue. Lloyds has continued to hold the shares as an investment, but the
board considers there is no longer any advantage in so doing.
Lloyds has retreated from overseas exposure in recent years and has
created in some minds the impression of being one of the the most inward
looking of the British banks.
This has culminated in the #1800m acquisition of the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society which was approved last week by shareholders
in both.
A Lloyds spokesman said that the StanChart move had nothing to do with
the C&amp;G acquisition and did not need the sale proceeds for its
financing.

SCOTLAND'S men have been overshadowed in recent years in the British
University Hockey Championships by their female colleagues but yesterday
in the opening series of games, they captured the limelight, writes
Joseph Dillon.
They scored a 2-1 victory over Northern Ireland but the margin of
success was much greater than the scoreline suggests.
Only twice in the course of the match did David Braithwaite's goal
come under attack.
The Irish managed to keep the Scots at bay until the forty-fifth
minute when Graham Wylie had a shot kept out of the goal illegally by
the foot of a defender and this set up his Menzieshill club-mate, Kevin
Squire, to open Scotland's account.
Scotland were in complete command and added a second goal 10 minutes
from time when Simon Balchin, Scotland's most industrious player,
created an opening to put David Stephen clear on the left and his
through ball was turned into goal by Darren Gibson.
The Irish did manage to pull a goal back four minutes from time
through Stevie Magee, but it did nothing to alter the pattern of the
game.
In the corresponding match at women's level, Scotland, winners of the
title for the past three years, were sent crashing to a 3-0 defeat.
Results:
MEN -- England 6, Wales 0; Scotland 2, Northern Ireland 1.
WOMEN -- England 18, Wales 0, Scotland 0, Northern Ireland 3.

Rover made a pre-tax profit of #83m in 1994 -- an increase of nearly
#50m on 1993 and its best result for years, according to the car
company's chief executive John Towers. The result is a far cry from the
debt-ridden days the company had in its British Leyland era of the
1970s.
Mr Towers stressed that the company was enjoying a good relationship
with German car giant BMW, which bought Rover last year. ''We have been
able to keep the independence of the two businesses. It was important
not to create 'greying' and we have tried to hold on to the distinctive
characteristics of the two companies,'' he said.

THERE is only one thing which frightens Irvine's Paul Weir as he
chases his dream of winning world titles at three different weights --
failure.
Mind you, he has never had much experience of that in a boxing career
which took him all over the world as an amateur and now has him facing
his fifth world title fight in what will be only his tenth professional
bout.
Tonight the 27-year-old Scot makes his first defence of the WBO
light-flyweight title against Renato ''Ric'' Magramo, of the
Philippines, in his home town -- he gave up the world straw-weight crown
to concentrate on the heavier division -- and already he looking ahead
to even bigger things.
''Boxing is such a short career, and I can't afford to hang about,''
he says. ''I have to achive my ambitions and make my money as quickly as
I can.''
Before he beat South Africa's Paul Oulden to win the vacant title in
Irvine last November, Weir admitted that if he failed he would consider
retiring from the sport. ''I've got used to fighting for world titles
and I doubt if I could motivate myself for anything less,'' he said at
the time.
Nothing has changed. Weir has also said that he wants to be out of the
ring by the time he is 30, and long before that his aim is to add the
world flyweight crown to the straw and light-fly.
To stay on course, he cannot afford to fail against the Filipino
champion. Having been with the little Scot on his rapid rise to the top,
I simply don't see him failing. He keeps telling us that he is getting
better and better and that the best is still to come, and there is
certainly more maturity to him now.
Weir wears his crown well and is in magnificent condition for
tonight's job. The one thing thing you can always be sure of with the
Irvine boxer is that his preparation has been thorough, and that in
itself breeds confidence. At the official weigh-in last night, both Weir
and Magramo scaled bang on the 7st 10lb limit.
Magramo, whose father Ric was beaten by Walter McGowan at Paisley in
1963 and whose younger brother Ronnie is being lined up to challenge
Thailand's Chana Porpaoin for the WBA straw-weight title later this
summer, certainly has not looked too confident since arriving in
Scotland last weekend.
He is a seasoned professional and is sure to prove durable, as most of
the fighters from the Philippines do, but his record suggests that he
may just be stepping outside his class at this level. He has the
reputation of being a fighter, but technically he is limited and I
expect Weir to fully exploit that.
The Scot says he has prepared to go the full distance of 12 rounds,
but I expect him to wear down and eventually stop the challenger any
time after the seventh.
Topping the undercard is Willie ''The Mighty'' Quinn, from Tranent,
the boxer with the biggest fan club in Scotland, even although he has
not yet fought for a title.
Tonight the middleweight, who has suffered only one defeat in 16
contests -- later avenged -- faces Burnley's John Duckworth and the
prize for victory, says manager Tommy Gilmour, will be a championship
fight of some sort. I don't see Quinn not collecting. Other bouts on
tonight's bill:
Welter -- Joe Townsley (Cleland) v Brian Dunn (Hull). Light -- Mark
Breslin (Barrhead) v T J Smith (Kettering). Super-feather -- Hugh
Collins (Stirling) v Kid McAuley (Doncaster). Feather -- Ian McLeod
(Kilmarnock) v Colin Innes (Newcastle). Fly -- Keith Knox (Bonnyrigg) v
Louis Veitch (Blackpool).

GOLF is a game of style, a game of precision and, most of all, a game
of tradition. One of those traditions is that a player scoring a hole in
one rewards his or her caddie handsomely. But maybe a new tradition will
emerge from the recent actions of David Toms.
Toms was playing in Monterrey, Mexico, on one of the stops on the Nike
Tour, a burgeoning circuit for emerging golfing talent. Toms' caddie was
Harold Humes, a man with whom he had never worked before and, most
likely, never will again.
Throughout the tournament, Toms and Humes argued about club selection
and the player's putting. Prior to the fourteenth hole, the debate
intensified when Toms pulled out a No.5 iron while Humes insisted he
needed a six. Toms did it his own way, striking the ball out of sight
onto the green.
When the two arrived at the green and did not spy any ball, Toms
realised he had made a hole in one. Humes begged to differ and pulled
out a putter. That was the last straw, and Toms handed him his walking
papers.
''I would have fired him earlier, but I couldn't carry the bag
myself,'' commented Toms later. ''I might have to put my wife on the bag
if this happens again.''
* SPORT is serious business in the USA, but some fans just seem to
take the whole thing a bit too seriously. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays
baseball team have found that out in no uncertain manner.
The Devil Rays are a new team who spent considerable months debating
and discussing in order to come up with a nickname that would reflect
both the dynamism of so new an organisation and the coastal background
from which it comes. For a while, it seemed as though everyone was in
agreement that Devil Rays fitted the bill just fine.
That was until an over-observant fan realised that Ray spelled
backwards is Yar, and that Yar is the name of a satanic canine. Now
objections are growing in the community and the Devil Rays are working
hard to prove that they are not a bunch of baseball-playing devil
worshippers.
One unidentified agitator commented: ''If they don't change that name,
they can all go to hell.''
* DEATH and taxes, so the saying goes, are the two things in life that
are absolutely guaranteed. Of course, that doesn't mean that you have to
be happy about it. Nick Kypreos, a forward with the New York Rangers ice
hockey team, obviously isn't.
Specifically, he takes exception to one form of federal tax, called
FICA, that is deducted from every pay-cheque in the entire USA.
Thankfully, he recently had the opportunity to visit the White House and
conduct his own investigation into the matter.
Kypreos and his team-mates were asked to pay a visit to President
Clinton in recognition of their victory in last season's Stanley Cup
championship. Kypreos was asked what was the first thing he intended to
do upon his arrival in the US capital.
''I want to find out who this FICA guy is and how come he's taking so
much of my money,'' he replied.
* FOR those who don't know, a Zamboni machine is a specially designed
motorised vehicle that resurfaces ice skating rinks during intervals in
ice hockey matches. Named for the man who invented it, it has become a
staple at every ice rink across the USA. Except, that is, in St Paul,
Minnesota, where they have a Spamboni machine.
Hormel Foods, a local company that manufactures spam and other meat
products, purchased sponsorship rights to the Zamboni machine at the
arena of the Minnesota Moose ice hockey team. No sooner had they
acquired the machine than they transformed it into a giant ice repairing
can of spam.
The promotion has been so successful that sales of spam in the region
have soared and the company has even started to give away spamburgers at
many Moose matches.

FOLLOWING swiftly on the sale by power company Manweb of its retailing
activities to Scottish Power, South Western Electricity (SWEB) is to
unload a major part of its electrical retailing operation to Norweb for
#4.3m cash and is closing the remainder, writes CHRIS STONE.
Four other electrical companies -- East Midlands, Yorkshire, London,
and Swalec -- have already abandoned their retail activities.
Norweb is one of the few electricity companies to make a success of
retailing. The deal covers 18 of SWEB's out-of-town superstores and a
licence to operate from 16 of its 46 High Street outlets.
The 513 staff employed in the shops involved will be transferred to
Norweb and another 120 appliance servicing staff would be retaimed. But
around 300 jobs are expected to go on the closure of the remaining 30
stores over the next few months although SWEB said it would try to
redeploy staff who wanted to stay with the company.
SWEB will be making an exceptional provision of about #20m before tax
in the year to March 31, 1995 to cover the write-down of assets and the
cost of shop closures. But the company said liquidation of the assets
would enable it to cut borrowings by about #27m after payment of closure
costs.
SWEB shares firmed 5p to 635p.

The Scottish Claymores yesterday were rocked by a second managerial
change in 24 hours when head coach Lary Kuharich was sacked, and
replaced by Jim Criner of the backroom staff.
Assistant coach Doug Williams, who resigned on Monday after a
personality clash with Kuharich, has been welcomed back with a bigger
role, in charge of the wide receivers.
Claymores official Wil Wilson last night admitted ''player power'' had
played a big part in the managerial movements. But now the team will put
the upheaval behind them as they prepare for their first game in the
World Bowl series, against Dusseldorf Rhein at Murrayfield on Sunday.
Wilson said: ''Lary was relieved of his duties after a difference of
opinion and clash of personalities within the team and staff. His
coaching philosophy did not mesh with the system we had.
''He took it very well. Being fired is par for the course in American

He added that general manager Sandy Waters and World League Director
of Football Operations, Jerry Vainisi, had met with players and staff

CHRIS Eubank is being lined up for a 10-round fight at the Kings Hall,
Belfast -- with America's former WBA super-middleweight champion Steve
Little a possible opponent.
Although it appears to be a difficult assignment, Eubank is keen to
win a re-match with Dubliner Steve Collins, the man who took away his
WBO title after 12 gruelling rounds last month.
Eubank will probably feature on the same May 27 bill as Ulsterman
Eamonn Loughran, who looks likely to contest his postponed WBO
welterweight title defence with Gary Murray as the chief support.
Prince Naseem Hamed has been told he is one fight away from a world
title shot. But first he must dispose of Mexican Enrique Angeles when he
defends his WBC International super-bantamweight title on May 6.
The present holder of the world title, Wilfredo Vasquez, has a
mandatary defence coming up shortly. ''So I have to wait for two results
before contracts can be exchanged, but I hope Naz's chance will come in
July,'' said promoter Frank Warren.

THE BBC in London is wrong to snivel and quibble about the judgments
of the Scottish courts over the Panorama affair. And BBC Scotland, for
the sake of its well-earned reputation for honest and inquiring
political journalism over many years, should consider its position
carefully before offering any further support.
Journalistically, it was foolish and unfair for anyone associated with
the BBC at the highest level to contemplate transmitting such an
interview at such a time.
There was never the slightest chance of the BBC nationally balancing
the item. How could they? What secret plan existed to thwart criticism
of the kind that, eventually, humiliated their worst endeavours?
There is something a good deal more important at stake here than the
so-called BBC producer guidelines. People not usually associated with
these matters might not realise the guidelines are just a teeny-weeny
bit less substantial than the Representation of the People Act.
To busy producers, the RPA can be irksome at times, I know. But it has
changed with the years, and it actually works. It is especially
protective of minorities who might otherwise be ignored.
Until we are in possession of something better, or the BBC guidelines,
sanctioned by the Government-appointed Board of Governors, and
interpreted by whoever happens to be in charge at the time, replace the
law of land, it is certainly worth protecting.
It is a tough business saying No to Downing Street. Producers almost
always want the Prime Minister -- whoever she or he happens to be! -- on
their programme. But come the real election, this year, next year, or,
at the latest, in 1997, all the main parties will endeavour to dictate
the broadcasting agenda. The BBC -- and ITV, together with Channel 4 --
must be supported in resisting that pressure.

Clydebank 1, Raith Rovers 2
IN the emotion-charged atmosphere that was Kilbowie Park last night, a
most fitting tribute to the late Davie Cooper was played out between his
beloved Bankies and Raith Rovers, managed by one of his closest friends.
Prior to kick-off a one-minute silence was observed, and the
appearance of Clydebank on the park displayed the absence of the No.7
jersey which belonged to Cooper.
Raith, thanks to a glorious winner from Steve Crawford only two
minutes from time, grabbed the priceless points which took them into
joint top spot in the first division and extended their unbeaten league
run to 13 games.
Brave Bankies, however, are now dangerously perched on the relegation
trapdoor.
An interesting contrast in styles emerged during an engrossing opening
half. Raith favoured all-out attack with Coyle, Kirkwood, and Lennon
their midfield inspiration. Clydebank appeared content to soak up the
pressure and hit on the break.
Raith broke the deadlock after 53 minutes, when Cameron netted from
close range from a Crawford cross. Six minutes later came a superb
equaliser, when 18-year-old Joe Robertson nodded in Kerrigan's cross.
Then came Crawford's winner for Raith, which capped an excellent
all-round team performance and gives them an excellent chance of
promotion. Clydebank's Sweeney and Crawford were booked.

ONCE again we have bully-boy tactics from Labour, Liberal, and SNP.
They say that the Conservative Party is of no consequence to Scotland,
they say that John Major, the Prime Minister, is a ''grey man'' and that
Scotland doesn't want him. But John Major is giving Scotland what it
wants -- the reform of local government. That's what the other parties
don't like or understand -- giving the electorate what they want and
giving them value for money.
So what do the other parties do? They run scared, they play-act at
taking the BBC to court and, boy, did they milk the scene for publicity.
They perform their own act of censorship, by stopping a broadcast -- by
the Prime Minister -- an interview which I understand covered national
and international issues and did not mention Scottish issues.
The Conservatives have an excellent record of efficiency and low
council tax in local government -- the other parties hate that. They
also hate the fact that economic facts speak for themselves and indicate
that the economy is gaining strength. So their answer is to gag the
Prime Minister -- what an insult to the electorate!
What's going to happen then the Labour Party calls a conference to
debate Clause IV just before the English elections in May? Is that their
rallying cry? Who is going to be gagged then?

<HEADLINE>Atlantech is given #2m for global launch</HEADLINE>

A CUMBERNAULD-based company yesterday received #2m from investment
capital group 3i for the global launch of a multimedia support product
which has already attracted British Telecom.
Three-year-old Atlantech Technologies, which considers its
AccessVision telecommunications network management software to be a
market leader, expects to be involved in four or five interactive
multimedia trials around the globe by the end of 1995.
The company is very much the minnow in the group working on BT's
Ipswich-based interactive television trial, which is due on line later
this year.
Some of the others involved in BT's video-on-demand, home shopping and
home banking trials, such as Oracle and Apple, are household names.
However, David Sibbald, chairman and managing director of Atlantech,
believes his company's product will allow telecommunications giants to
deliver a massively complex set of services in a predictable and
cost-effective manner.
If a customer chose to have a video sent down the line, rather than
visiting the rental shop, Atlantech believes its monitoring system would
alert the service provider to any fault in equipment in the subscriber's
home before he or she became aware of it.
Government agency Scottish Enterprise, which 18 months ago put up
#250,000, is investing another #200,000 in Atlantech.
With BT's trial being replicated in about another 27 countries
spanning Europe, North America and Asia, Atlantech's potential market is
huge.
While there is always a risk in hi-tech ventures where the eggs are
effectively in one basket, 3i, having taken references from Atlantech's
customers and business partners, believes it has gained as much comfort
as possible in the venture capital game.
There is no doubting the ambition of Atlantech, which has a workforce
of only 26 but has already linked up with France's Groupe Bull in Europe
and US giant Westell.
Mr Sibbald said: ''We expect that, within the next five to eight
years, Atlantech Technologies will be a household name in the way Apple
and Microsoft are.''
The investment by 3i ties in with its recently-launched Emerging
Business Initiative, which aims to target young companies with the
potential to be the major players of tomorrow.
Grant McGregor, an investment executive at the Glasgow offices of 3i,
said: ''Atlantech is an exciting young Scottish company which has
developed a world-leading product. We are pleased to have had the
opportunity to invest at this critical stage in the development of what
is a key emerging technology.''

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S John Higgins took another step towards a third major title
with a 5-0 whitewash of Grimsby's Karl Broughton in the Castella Classic
British Open.
The Grand Prix and International Open champion hit breaks of 111, 60,
and 75 as he wrapped up victory in 80 minutes at Plymouth.
But fellow Scot Alan McManus became the first top-eight seed to go out
as his dismal run continued. The 24-year-old No.7 seed lost 5-1 to
Stoke's Dave Harold and his only success came in the second frame with a
break of 54.
He lost the next on default after he was called for three successive
misses when trailing 18-0. Harold finished it off with runs of 67, 58,
and 73.
Steve Davis pipped Tony Knowles 5-4 to maintain his hoodoo over him.
He has rattled off nine successive victories since Knowles beat him 10-1
in their first meeting in the 1982 world championship when Davis was the
defending champion.
Knowles, leading 3-1, went in-off after having potted the pink in the
fifth frame and led 63-0 but missed a black trying to split the pack in
the next.
Davis led 4-3 up before Knowles compiled a superb 135 clearance to set
up the decider, but Davis always had control. Second-round results:
D Harold (Eng) beat A McManus (Sco) 5-1; P Ebdon (Eng) beat W Jones
(Wal) 5-1; D O'Kane (NZ) beat S Lee (Eng) 5-4; J Wattana (Thai) beat D
Reynolds (Eng) 5-2; S Davis (Eng) beat T Knowles (Eng) 5-4; J Higgins
(Sco) beat K Broughton (Eng) 5-0; J White (Eng) beat S James (Eng) 5-0;
P Francisco (SA) beat N Bond (Eng) 5-3.

''CRICKET matches are now degenerated into business of importance. It
is confidently said that a set of idle fellows or more properly a gang
of dextrous gamblers, are hired and maintained by a most noble lord at
so little an expense as #1000 per year.''
The newspaper was the Morning Post, the year was 1774, the noble lord
was Lord Frederick Beauclark, and there was not a Pakistani player in
sight. What is interesting is how cricket appears to have come full
circle, from murky to squeaky clean to murky, in the course of two
centuries.
In its origins, cricket was a game on which heavy bets were laid and
therefore immediate suspicions of rigging matches arose. Then came the
Victorian Public School ethos, which invested cricket with almost
supernatural powers of character formation. And now we have the latest
from Pakistan.
Prejudice, of course, plays its part here. We'll deal with Pakistan in
a moment, but it is worth remembering that the two Australians who took
advantage of the 500-1 offered against their opponents, England, in
Botham's Test at Leeds were simply thought of as a couple of larrikins,
acting out the Australian character we have come to know and admire.
Strangely, the first suspension for gambling in England in modern
times was that of a Pakistan batsman, Younis Ahmed, formerly of Surrey
but then playing with Worcestershire. In 1983 as a Worcester player he
bet on their opponents, Leicestershire, in a Sunday League game and had
to go. The latest scandals are far more deep-rooted and therefore
potentially far more worrying.
It is probably fair to say that Pakistan cricket is more subject to
government control than any other country with the exception of
pre-apartheid South Africa. Pakistan cricket is a constant factional
struggle with Lahore against Karachi against Islamabad. Often the least
formidable of its enemies are the actual opposition. Let's look at the
latest causes for concern.
The captain, Salim Malik, has been suspended by the Pakistan Board of
Cricket Control, as has team manager Intikhab Alam, whose cheerful
presence was familiar to frequenters of Hamilton Crescent in the 1960s.
They have been stood down because of disquiet over the latest Pakistan
tour of Zimbabwe, where the first Test was lost quickly and
comprehensively.
I mean no disrespect to Zimbabwe, who have four or five really good
players and half a dozen or so foot-soldiers, when I say that this
result was only fractionally more surprising than a Scottish win over
West Indies in a five-day Test if such existed. The result looked all
the stranger when Pakistan went on to take the next two Tests with some
ease and become the first nation ever to win a three-match series after
having lost the opening game.
The oddity of this tour was compounded further by two of the side,
Basid Ali and Rashid Latif, suddenly walking away in mid-trip, giving as
their reason that ''they were tired of the international circuit and
were giving up the game.'' Very strange: neither was exactly a Test
veteran and cricket is a lucrative pursuit for good Pakistani players on
and off the field. Had they seen something they could not accept or was
there another reason?
Nor could the Zimbabwe affair be seen in isolation. It emerged by
means of a sworn affidavit that Shane Warne and Tim May, the Australian
spinners, had been offered #33,000 to bowl badly in the first Test at
Karachi in September 1994. They declined the offer and Pakistan won
eventually by one wicket. Curiously though, this did not come to light
until the following February, whereas normally players approached are
very anxious that their refusal should be made public at the first
available opportunity.
The average cricket follower is both appalled and intrigued by all
this. Appalled because any spectator sport which is seen to be fixed is
in the long run doomed; intrigued because he wonders: how DO you fix a
team game with certainty? Spinners bowling loosely in a Test match have
a very limited shop life and even a bad ball often brings a wicket in
the shape of a blinding catch, for the fielder at gully might well not
know what has been arranged. You could get at an umpire but with instant
replays and six camera angles, his mistakes if frequent, would ensure
that he never stood at Test level again. Any bribe would have to reflect
that.
In theory, you could get the openers to crawl along when chasing a
target, especially in a one-day match, but if the captain is clean he
would be liable, on the fall of a wicket, to organise a deliberately
accidental run-out. It would seem that every man in the side would have
to know and in such a case long-term secrecy is impossible.
Few would go the length of Imran Khan, the former Pakistan captain,
who has been quoted as saying that if the matter is proved, then those
responsible should be hanged.
There is, however, a precedent from another sport, baseball. In 1919
the Chicago White Sox -- or Black Sox, as they came to be known -- were
indicted before a Chicago Grand Jury for throwing the World Series
against the Cincinnati Reds. The trial took an eternity, and witnesses
and documents kept disappearing, mysterious-like. The newly appointed
Baseball Commissioner, a man with the splendid name of Kenesaw Mountain
Landis, let it be known that irrespective of what the Grand Jury did --
nothing, as it proved -- those players arraigned would never play Major
League baseball again. Nor did they, but today that would mean legal
standards of proof.
Such is the deliberate speed of the law, however, that if suspects
were suspended until the matter were resolved, that would effectively
take care of the issue. Meanwhile the paradox remains that these issues
have surfaced on the Indian sub-continent, where in India gambling is
legal only on race tracks, and in Pakistan not at all.

Forfar 1, Montrose 3
MONTROSE threw themselves a promotion lifeline when they defeated
title favourites Forfar in last night's Angus derby.
It took the visitors just six minutes to open the scoring. Colin
McRonald swung a corner into the packed goalmouth and recent signing
Shaun Smith got the final touch.
Forfar mounted a sustained period of pressure, but Montrose rode the
storm and made it 2-0 on the half-hour mark. A blunder at the back saw
the defence fail to clear a cross from McRonald and Mark Craib shot low
into the net.
The league leaders dragged themselves back into the match in the
thirty-seventh minute with a great half volley from Dave Bingham, who
found the corner of the net from outside the box.
However, Montrose restored their two-goal advantage within 30 seconds
of the second half getting under way, when Colin McGlashan cut in from
the left and hit a perfectly placed drive wide of keeper Arthur.

HIGHLY successful specialist packaging and labelling group Boxmore
International is buying the privately owned GCM Print &amp; Packaging
Service for #25m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The deal will further increase its exposure to the healthcare and
pharmaceuticals sectors which are among the fastest growing in the
packaging industry.
Major customers such as Glaxo-Wellcome are looking for one stop
suppliers and with the growth of the over-the-counter medicines and self
medication requiring leaflets, GCM is ideally placed with its production
of printed cartons. It is being acquired at about 12 times earnings from
two families controlling about 67% of the equity, 3i with 22% and
management with about 10%.
In the nine months to December, it achieved pre-tax profits of #2.14m
on turnover of #10.8m.
Boxmore itself increased 1994 pre-tax profits by 58.6% to #7.05m on
turnover some 43.6% higher at #46.9m.
The company is the dominant supplier of plastic barrier containers in
the UK and of PET containers for the mineral water industry. It is
introducing a tamper-proof seal for pharmaceutical packages which will
enable its Labels Research subsidiary to increase operating margins from
the current 23% to around 30%.
The dividend total has been raised 12% to 4.48p.

<HEADLINE>Olazabal back in the swing after foot operation Champion hones his short game</HEADLINE>

FOR quite separate causes, Jose Maria Olazabal and Nick Faldo are
probably in more relaxed frames of mind than they have been for a long
time -- even perhaps than they have ever been. This change from their
previous almost hunted attitude to golf itself and the world at large
could not be more timely.
Yesterday, 48 hours before he starts his attempt to become only the
third player, after Faldo and Jack Nicklaus, to defend the US Masters
tournament successfully, the only limp joint in Olazabal's game derives
from the legacy of the recent operation he had on his right big toe.
But even on the Augusta National club's exemplary course, far hillier
than the flattening effect of the television camera discloses, Olazabal
will not be uncomfortable. ''Anyway,'' he acknowledged cheerfully, ''it
doesn't bother me swinging the club and at the moment it's only my short
game that's giving me any reason for concern.''
Olazabal has been spending two hours a day honing this department,
particularly vital here, where the certainty of human mistakes or
misjudgments imposes strict responsibility on chipping and holing out on
greens whose huge and sweeping slopes will, barring serious rainfalls
which are not forecast, be as firm and fast as usual.
The grinding of teeth and the gnashing of egos last year reached epic
proportions in reaction to a few rogue pin positions. But this outbreak
of paranoia successfully concealed two little-known facts -- Olazabal's
winning total of 279 would have won 16 of the previous Masters, and that
after having bogeyed his very first hole, he had only four more.
Such economy of error underlines the advantage of filling a reservoir
of experience of this 6925-yard examination. ''Everyone makes a lot of
mistakes to begin with,'' Olazabal noted. ''Then you have to learn where
to hit the ball to open the best way to the hole.
''If there's any extra pressure in defending, I won't mind it. I'm
more relaxed now that I've won my first major and achieved one of my
goals as a professional.'' Victory, indeed, represented ambitions
postponed from 1991, when he bogeyed the last hole and lost to Ian
Woosnam by a stroke.
That setback affected Olazabal's form and confidence for two months,
but he added: ''Time goes by and you forget, and you concentrate again
on what you have to do.'' What Olazabal, at 29, would enjoy doing on
Sunday -- Severiano Ballesteros' thirty-eighth birthday -- is contesting
the destiny of the title with his compatriot, already twice winner of
it.
Faldo, doubtless, would relish nothing better than thwarting both
Spaniards, and with the exception of his missing the cut at the Players'
Championship, he has endorsed significantly the decision taken on the
flight home after last year's Masters to commit himself more fully to
the US Tour.
Having already played in eight of the 19 tournaments he intends to
enter in America this season, twice as many as at this time last year,
Faldo is ''much better prepared.'' He explained: ''I've had almost two
weeks' rest, dividing my time between enjoying being reunited with the
family and working two hours a day with my coach, David Leadbetter.
''I needed the continuity of competition and the consistency of the
playing and practising conditions,'' Faldo added. ''Things change and I
believe I'm swinging better than five years ago (when he last won this
title). There are fewer distractions than in Europe and I'm enjoying
myself, just playing golf and getting a good run at it.''
Naturally, Faldo shrugged off his installation as 7-1 favourite. He
was readier to offer an opinion on the hugely talented US amateur
champion, Tiger Woods, with whom he practised on Monday: ''He enjoys
hitting the ball a long way with the fast shoulder turn which is the
gift of the elasticity of youth. He made me feel old.''
Faldo's wry reference to his age, as he creaks towards his own
thirty-eighth birthday, recalled that success in the Masters has
traditionally come to those who wait. The days of the years for the 58
winners since 1934 averages 32.09.

one at the 170-yard sixteenth during practice yesterday.  Elkington's
ace was followed half an hour later by that of Couples

I THOUGHT no-one read editorials these days, but I was sufficiently
interested in your thoughts on the Panorama case to read your views with
care (April 4).
I could not agree more with your conclusion that the BBC was foolish.
Add to that, naive and stupid, and you would probably have a more
accurate description of those who wanted to broadcast Mr Major's
interview in the same week as the Scottish local government elections.
I might say that, as a loyal Conservative who will turn out to vote
for the local Conservative candidate on Thursday, I would have liked to
have watched the Prime Minister. But, objectively speaking, it would
have been farcical to have imagined that Conservatives would not have
been ''incandescent with rage'' had the BBC tried to broadcast a similar
interview with the Labour leader this week, or the leader of any other
political party.
The BBC is great as an entertainment company, but for judgment on news
and current affairs only justifies its licence fee with the excellent
Radio 5 Live and the World Service.

SHARES in Pittencrieff Resources surged 9p to 83p yesterday, after the
oil and gas group announced it was seeking buy-back authority.
The Edinburgh-based company doubled in size last summer through the
$40m acquisition of fields in Corpus Christi, Texas.
As a result of both this and the simultaneous demerger of it US
communications subsidiary on to Wall Street, no comparative figures were
provided with yesterday's seven-month results.
Chairman Michael Munro considered any meaningful comparison ''pretty
well impossible''.
In the transitionary period to December 31, Pittencrieff Resources
made pre-tax profits of #1.05m, on turnover of #7.34m.
By lunchtime, volume in Pittencrieff Resources was fast approaching
500,000 shares, a high level for a relatively small capitalisation
stock.
Shareholders in the original Pittencrieff exchanged their shares for
new ones in the re-named Pittencrieff Resources, which began trading on
June 1 after acquiring the core oil and gas business of the original
company.
At the time of the demerger, the new company raised a net #25m through
a placing and open offer of shares at 100p, to finance the purchase of
the Corpus Christi fields.
Investors recouped more than one-third of their subsequent losses
yesterday, in a reaction to what the market apparently considered to be
better-than-expected results and to news of the proposed share buy-back
powers.
The company will seek authority to purchase for cancellation up to 10%
of its share capital, at an extraordinary general meeting on May 19. The
move is likely to have convinced the market that the company has
confidence in itself.
Mr Munro said the board would only use the power if it made economic
sense in terms of shareholder value.
He added: ''We take the view that at certain times it may be
advantageous to purchase shares. If we all felt the shares were
ridiculously cheap, we would want the power to do that.''
The company plans an interim dividend in October, with no payment
being made for the period to the end of last year.
Pittencrieff Resources, which plans to focus on its major fields
through disposal of a myriad of smaller interests, is looking to
increase distributable reserves through cancellation its share premium
account.
Mr Munro considered the seven-month results satisfactory, in light of
weak North American natural gas prices and timing delays in development
of the Corpus Christi fields.
Daily production at Corpus Christi had risen sharply, to the
equivalent of 2900 barrels per day, by the start of this year. By the
end of 1994, Pittencrieff was producing the equivalent of more than 5000
bpd.
Proven and probable reserves were valued at #110m at the year-end.
Four-fifths of these are in the US, with the remainder in Canada.
Natural gas interests account for about 70% of total reserves.
In spite of a plunge in the natural gas price to $1.30 per thousand
cubic feet earlier this year, Mr Munro is confident about 1995 as a
whole.
However, his confidence is ''subject to oil and gas prices and
exchange rate movements''.

IS it pure coincidence that no other political party leader apart from
John Major was asked to take part in the BBC Panorama programme which
was to be broadcast on Monday, April 3, so near to the Scottish local
elections?
Could it be that one of the main reporters on Panorama is Jane Corbin
who just happens to be married to the deputy chairman of the
Conservative Party, namely Mr John Maples?

THE unfortunate article by Clare Henry, ''Scottish printmakers kept
out of the picture'' (February 27), requires, I regret to say, a
detailed refutation.
Nearly every allegation in the article is untrue. I have never used
the word ''dire'' or anything remotely similar to describe Scottish
printmaking, print workshops, or Scottish art. Nor have I ignored
Scottish work ''unless mediated by London promoters and dealers''.
In the last 10 years the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art has
built up a very substantial collection of works by living artists,
costing hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Much of this has been purchased either direct from the artists
themselves or through Scottish galleries, including the Glasgow Print
Studio, the Edinburgh Printmakers' Workshop and Peacock Printmakers in
Aberdeen.
During the same period we have continually exhibited modern Scottish
art, in both large survey exhibitions and several one-person shows.
All of my staff and I regularly visit the Edinburgh and Glasgow print
workshops. I most certainly have visited Aberdeen's Peacock Printmakers,
as its director, Arthur Watson, will confirm; I even commissioned from
Peacock the four large screenprints by Davie, Bellany, McLean, and
Wiszniewski which are permanently displayed at Edinburgh's Haymarket
station. Between 1984 and 1993 two of my staff served, consecutively, on
the board of Edinburgh Printmakers.
If that is not sufficient proof of ''moral support'', I might add that
before Christmas I attended a Scottish Arts Council client meeting with
the board of Glasgow Print Studio, in Glasgow, to assess the workshop's
objectives and needs.
I also recommended the Glasgow Print Studio to the British Council in
Tel Aviv as the best British source and venue for an exchange of
printmakers with Israel, a gesture which has resulted in an invitation
to its Director, John Mackechnie, to visit Israel.
It is alleged that Paragon Press now focuses exclusively on English
artists and English printers. However, the most recent of Paragon's
publications, by the Edinburgh artist Alan Johnston, was printed in
Edinburgh by one of the staff of Edinburgh Printmakers Workshop. Ten out
of the 34 projects in our current show devoted to Paragon Press are by
Scottish artists. Robert Adam's ''quotes'' from the Paragon catalogue
are fabrications, and Adam, whom we have since contacted, acknowledges
that he had seen neither the catalogue nor our exhibition when he was
interviewed by your critic.
The reputation of Scottish printmaking and of Scottish art has
benefited enormously from Paragon Press. Through working with Paragon,
for example, Peacock Printmakers has had prints acquired by important
collections such as the Tate Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art in New
York whereas previously they had none of their prints in these
collections.
Arthur Watson, Director of Peacock, has readily acknowledged to me the
important work Paragon has done for Scottish printmaking; he did, he
assures me, make this very clear to your critic. It is disappointing
that Henry has chosen to ignore his positive comments.
The exhibition's second venue, together with its catalogue, -- at the
Yale Centre for British Art in the USA -- will ensure that Scottish art
finds a wide public audience within an international framework. I regard
this as a matter for celebration.
The falsehoods and tone of Clare Henry's piece seem deliberately
intended to belittle the work of some of our major artists. Readers of
your distinguished newspaper deserve better than this, masquerading as
art criticism.

A FIRM of international estate agents has released the secrets of its
success -- a ''foreign foibles'' guide.
Knight Frank and Rutley sell nearly half of their most expensive
properties to overseas customers and reckon their man in Edinburgh,
Colin Strang Steel, is the expert when it comes to dealing with foreign
buyers.
The senior partner in Scotland said yesterday: ''Most people keep
their national foibles when choosing a home abroad.''
Americans, he says, want to buy an ancient Highland castle -- with an
indoor pool and all mod cons.
Indians want to argue about the price of everything and make offers on
a lucky holy day.
The French will live for a time in near squalor as long as the address
is right -- and a better one is not available.
Japanese workers are careful not to buy a bigger house than their boss
and prefer simple, plain rooms for easy maintenance.
Mr Strang Steel says Scandinavians and the Swiss are most like the
British buyer and are the easiest to deal with.

SEVEN days before the elections to the new local authorities I
received through the mail a copy of Strathclyder, the newspaper of
Strathclyde Regional Council. Was it by chance that this publication,
paid for by council-tax payers, should arrive when it did?
It would be difficult to imagine a more highly political document
masquerading as an official publication. The principal content is a
four-page article on the council tax to be charged in the incoming
financial year and Councillor John Mullin, chairman of the finance
committee, gives his views on the effects of ''savage cuts'' in
Government support funding.
To say the least the article and Councillor Mullin's remarks are
highly misleading. Based on its own estimates the facts are that the
regional council is to increase its spending by #214m or 7.47% this year
to a mammoth #3074.5m. Incredibly had it not been for the much-maligned
Government capping the council it seems would have increased its
spending by a further #107m or by a total of 11.12%.
The Government will be contributing 52.65% of the money to be spent by
the council even after the planned reduction in revenue support grant of
less than 0.5% of the council's projected spending. You might think that
this relatively minor reduction could have been accommodated by
economies but the council is not noted for its frugality.
To start with, however, it could cease publication of Strathclyder,
which I believe costs about #0.65m to produce. I am sure none would
lament its passing except perhaps the Labour Party.

TRUANCY and school attendance seem to fascinate public consciousness.
Practically every year, since I first became interested in the topic in
the early eighties, it is declared in the press by one authority or
another to be a great cause for concern and in need of fixing. Earlier
this year two pages in The Herald were devoted to the subject.
The word ''truancy'' is interesting in itself, coming from a Gaelic
word meaning wretched. Why such a connotation should have become
attached to the activity more mundanely described as ''dodging school''
is open to speculation, but perhaps goes some way to explaining why it
appears to obsess us. Are we really so angry with those who reject what
we consider good for them, that we have thought of them in such a way?
To define truancy is easy enough in casual conversation and probably
comes out as some subspecies of ''unauthorised non-attendance''.
However, the ''authorisers'' in this common definition are usually to be
thought of as the parents and they, alas, appear to use no reliable
yardstick.
Reasons given by parents to explain their child's absence do not stand
up well to critical examination. One child's mild morning queasiness is
another child's gastric upset and a week off school wrapped up in bed.
Cultural and social-class views of illness may govern decisions made by
parents about whether their child should stay off school or not. These
influences are powerful and, if we reflect on our own experiences as
school children, are probably passed from generation to generation. Some
families are just never off school due to illness and others are forever
sick with some bug or another.
Perhaps L W Kline, writing in 1898, explained it all best as '' . . .
a rebellion against suppressed activity and the denial of free outdoor
life''.
Definitions of truancy are unreliable and that of ''unauthorised
absence'' is as unreliable as they come. Total attendance is a better
measure of consumer satisfaction with school although it is not the only
one and neither is it necessarily the best.
In fact levels of school attendance have actually remained fairly
static for the past 80 or 90 years. In 1906 attendance in Scottish
schools was 87% and by 1934 it had reached 90%. A report published in
1977 commenting on these figures said: ''It was felt by some authorities
that it was hardly reasonable to hope for any noticeable improvement in
the regularity of school attendance.'' And yet we grumble.
It matters, of course, that our children go to school. As a society we
have an obligation to pass on our culture and to equip our children to
live and work in some degree of happiness, and contentment and freedom
from poverty. This, to a large extent, is the job we have given to our
schools, although I do not underestimate the role of the family.
Having allocated such a mammoth task to our schools it is, perhaps, no
surprise that we become agitated when some children seem wilfully to
turn up their noses at what is on offer. At different times and in
different places various schemes have been tried to drive the truant
back to school.
Automated telephone dialling systems in Texas call up parents in the
evening with a recorded message informing the family that little Elmer
had felt the call of the wild that day and absented himself from school.
Street-clean-up drives by the police in small-town America dump the
truants at City Hall for collection by their parents.
In Leeds the juvenile justice system continually adjourned the cases
of truants and demanded the reappearance of the child and his family
until an improvement in attendance was established.
All of these approaches are coercive and in no way address the problem
of what it is that the child is rejecting.
Currently there is a more enlightened attempt to place the problem of
school non-attendance firmly where it belongs within the larger and more
challenging field of School Effectiveness. In this context the problem
of school non-attendance begins to shrink to more manageable
proportions.
Some children will eventually tire of going to school because they do
not understand the curriculum. Some children will not go to school
because they are living in conditions of poverty, cultural and physical,
where two or three generations of the family have been extremely
economical with their attendance at school. Education has meant little
to the lives they have had to lead.
Less depressingly (or more so), some will not go to school until the
proper brand of training shoe has been purchased at a cost of anything
up to #100 or more. Some, of course, do not go to school because they
are bullied.
Part of the agenda for the newer studies into School Effectiveness
addresses the issue of what the school and indeed all of us can do to
help tackle these ''reasons'' for truancy from a less coercive point of
view. They do, I believe, throw light on the perennial ''problem'' of
the truant child and they will help us to create a more promising and
less ''wretched'' future for our school children.

THE idea for a rolling three-year plan of tax cuts was killed off by
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in a private meeting of Tory back benchers at
the Commons last night.
He insisted that the first priority for political recovery is that the
Government regains a reputation for competence.
None of the back benchers who attended the meeting of their finance
committee demurred. Right-winger Sir George Gardiner, chairman of a
group of a hundred, intervened to state that commitment to a three-year
tax-cutting plan would be unwise.
Chairman of the finance committee Mr John Townend, introducing the
Chancellor, called for backbench support to cut public expenditure to
enable tax cuts -- but he did not prosecute his plan for a three-year
commitment.
Mr Clarke told the back benchers that in order to establish a
''feel-good factor'' the vital thing was to establish in the voters'
minds that the Government was competent.
The next target was to get his November Budget forecast on the economy
right and credible. Only if this were achieved, would there be a
political gain for the Tories from the obvious economic recovery.
Without this, tax cuts would not be believed. They would be taken as
mere electioneering and so there would be no point in looking for
political advantage from them.
He said that the feel-good factor would return if tax cuts were shown
to be credible on strictly economic grounds. The Chancellor was not
pressed to commit himself on his November Budget.
It was hard enough to get the judgment right for one year, let alone
three years, he said.
Labour deputy leader John Prescott issued a statement last night about
what he called the Prime Minster's ''relaunch fiasco''.
He said that this ''has crashed into the ground like all his other
relaunches. They are all over the place on tax. Cabinet Ministers are
calling for each other's sackings over health, their plan to boost the
Prime Minister in advance of the Scottish local elections has backfired,
and sleaze has struck once more.

THE current election campaign has set new standards of equivocation
and half truths. A recent communication from Conservatives in East
Dunbarton attributes the lower levels of council tax in Milngavie and
Bearsden to the fact that the council is ''Conservative controlled''.
This conveniently ignores the fact that the Conservatives lost overall
control of that council at the last council elections. Do the Liberal
Democrat councillors (50% of the councillors) really have no influence
on the running of the district?
One of the key issues in the current campaign is the future of
education under the new unitary authorities. Despite pressure from
parents, teachers, educational administrators, and the churches, the
Government refused to make provision for education to be run by
professionals. There is no longer a requirement for a director of
education to be appointed or for an education committee to be formed.
When I tried to find out from a local candidate what Conservative
policy would be were they to be elected, I was told that ''This would be
a matter for the members of the new council''. In other words, ''vote
for us, and we will tell you afterwards what our policy is''. I think
not.

THE MEDIA industry in the UK has seen many changes in recent years,
the arrival of satellite and cable television and a revival in the
commercial radio market. The recession took its toll on advertising
revenues but there are signs that these are recovering.
There exits a distinct quoted broadcasting sector in Scotland whose
valuations compare favourably with their peers. The bulk of the market
is served by four quoted companies: Scottish Television (STV), Scottish
Radio, Grampian Television, and Border Television.
Commercial radio is rapidly expanding its share of display
advertising. Research by media analysts at brokers Bell Lawrie White
suggests that spending on radio in the UK will grow at a compound
annualised real growth rate of 8.2% until 2003. This trend is thought to
particularly favour Scottish Radio. Border Television and to a lesser
extent Grampian Television are both developing their radio activities
and so should also benefit.
However one potential problem on the horizon is the competition
arising from the Radio Authority's proposals to increase the number of
radio licences available and the likely advent of Digital Audio
Broadcasting. A number of licences which will probably be awarded
overlap with the company's existing stations. However, Bell Lawrie White
believes that these changes also offer considerable opportunities for
all three companies. They all have strong balance sheets and should
therefore be able to improve their relative positions.
Scottish Radio controls most of the radio stations in Scotland
including Radio Clyde and its services have the highest market shares in
the areas in which they operate. This makes the company attractive to
those seeking an entry into the UK radio market or wishing to expand
their existing interests. The company is expected to deliver healthy
profits growth from its existing business, from new licences which may
be won and from any acquisitions.
The terrestrial television market is a mature one and as such the
outlook is not as rosy as that for radio. Its share of the display
advertising market is expected to decline slowly as competition
increases from radio, satellite and cable television. Real growth in TV
advertising revenue is projected to be a little over 1% per annum
although this will be outweighed to some extent by the cash generative
nature of each Channel 3 television franchise which is secure for 10
years.
Bell Lawrie believes that the television activities of Border and
Grampian are well managed with low costs although it points out that
Grampian's audience share has slipped in recent times. Both companies
are relatively small in network terms with just 1% share each of total
network advertising revenue. However they are well placed in their local
areas and may be attractive to a predator.
Scottish TV has relatively high costs, because of its very high
commitment to Scottish regional and local programming, costing around
#6m extra annually. However, its output is particualrly highly regarded
by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) which regulates the
industry.
STV's profitability suffered a setback in 1994 becuase of the loss of
some advertising clients and the company's enforced move to a new sales
house. However it is expected to recover in 1995. STV has around 5%
share of the total television network advertising revenue with the
market dominated by the three very large players, Carlton/Central,
Granada/LWT and Meridian/Anglia.
Current rules prevent more than two franchises being controlled by any
one group. The large groups all now have two franchises and so further
polarisation in the industry is unlikely, at least in the near future.
In any case because of its unique franchise in Scotland, STV is seen as
virtually bid proof, at least by rival English companies.
However bid speculation did swirl around STV following last
September's acquisition of a 20% stake in the company by Mirror Group.
There is thought to be scope for co-operation between the two companies
in programme making for Mirror Group's cable TV interests. In addition
cost-cutting could occur in Glasgow where STV and Mirror Group's ''Daily
Record'' are based.
There are some negatives on the horizon for terrestrial television as
a whole, not least the developing market for satellite and cable
television. Although cable is currently only received in around one
million homes it has the potential to become a major force in
broadcasting not least because of its capacity to offer a wide range of
interactive services.
In addition, the bidding is currently on for the right to broadcast on
the new Channel 5. The fifth terrestrial channel is projected to reach
around 70% of UK households giving its owners a steady flow of
advertising revenues.
However this discussion may all be academic. There is a danger that as
the market for media becomes more global British companies as a whole
and Scottish ones in particular will be too small to compete.
Media groups are currently engaged in intensive lobbying of the
government as it reviews the regulations governing cross-media
ownership, although major changes appear to have been ruled out by the
Department of Heritage. The rules govern the stakes which press and
television companies hold in each other. Ministers will be keen to
balance the desire of media companies to grow bigger with the need to
maintain diversity.

YOUR editorial made a major, if common, omission regarding the
services which are vulnerable in the transition to the new authorities
(April 3). It is a mistake to believe that the main problems will mostly
occur in education, social work, and transport.
These are the three main services which will be transferred from the
old regional councils. They are large, prestigious, and
resource-intensive services and it is understandable that attention has,
so far, been focused on these. This mistake has been made throughout the
debate on reorganisation.
There is a growing feeling of concern and unease among those of us who
work with homeless people and those in the greatest housing need that
housing, the major service provided by current district councils, will
become marginalised in the new authorities.
Reorganisation presents major problems for housing. Many new
authorities will inherit different rent levels from the old authorities
which previously made up their catchment area. They will inherit
different allocation policies and vastly different levels of services
towards homeless people.
Though services for homeless people have developed over the years
there is a danger that much of this good work, especially around work
practice, could be lost as councillors' time and the resources of the
new authorities are concentrated on the former regional council
services.
Almost 100,000 Scots approach their authority every year because they
have no home, 193,000 households are on local authority waiting-lists,
and 584,000 households are living in homes with dampness, mould, or
condensation.
Local authorities have been given the prime responsibility for dealing
with these problems. At the same time, their resources have been
slashed. Since 1980-81 Government spending on housing has fallen from
9.4% of the Scottish Office budget to 4%. Yet at no time has the need
for affordable, decent homes been greater.
To date the debate surrounding the transition to the new authorities
has largely excluded the housing problems the new authorities will have
to deal with. It is a sad reflection on our country that the needs of
100,000 Scots who have no homes can so easily be ignored.

Ross Finlay holds on for a gripping experience.
WHEN the Jeep Cherokee was launched on the UK market, most of the
comments were about how sportingly it performed on the open road, rather
than about how this very American 4x4 went in rough territory. The
original press driving event did not offer anything in the way of
off-road activity but it was quite a different matter when we tried the
latest turbo diesel Cherokee last week in Sutherland.
In 1994, the British importers sold 4469 Cherokees, all built by
Chrysler on a dedicated right-hand drive production line -- for the
Japanese and UK markets -- in Toledo, Ohio. The Wrangler, more like a
throwback to the original wartime Jeep in appearance, sold 422 units,
converted to right-hand drive at the importers' own base in Dover.
Almost 50 left-hand drive Grand Cherokees were also sold here last year.
The Cherokee is noticeably smaller in the metal than it appears to be
in illustrations. Latest versions have a toned-down interior, compared
with the sock-it-to-them approach of the original Cherokees shipped
here.
Turbo diesel prices range from #18,195 to #23,895 for the Limited SE
model, which comes with Bridge of Weir Leather upholstery and burr elm
inlays, features very far from the rough and ready image conjured up by
the Jeep marque name. Unlike most 4x4s the Cherokee is built with a
monocoque construction. Although the turbo diesels offer better ground
clearance than the petrol versions, all Cherokees still come with a
lower centre of gravity than rival 4x4s. That, and an advanced
suspension design, help to explain why although the steering feels
rather woolly to begin with, these vehicles handle unexpectedly well on
the road.
Front accommodation is fine, although the steering wheel still comes
farther back into the cabin than I prefer, and the switches remain
airily scattered over the fascia. Rear seat space is poor, though,
partly because of a lack of kneeroom, and partly because the floor there
is high compared with the seat level.
There is no diesel Jeep on the US market. Chrysler went to VM of Italy
for a 2.5-litre turbo diesel power unit, a modified version of a design
which has been seen in British cars before. This engine and the
vehicle's compact dimensions are the main clues as to why the latest
Cherokee performs so well.
The 116bhp engine gives it excellent acceleration. Standstill to 60mph
takes 13 seconds and the test track maximum is 103mph. But the turbo
diesel Cherokee's great plus point is the vast amount of torque it
offers -- 207lb ft at 2000rpm. That should make it a very effective tow
car.
To its lively on-road handling the Cherokee adds a level of ride
comfort which few people would expect. It proved that on the undulating
roads around Lairg and Rosehall. That was a normal road version, after a
morning's off-road work in another example fitted with more businesslike
mud-terrain tyres.
On the heather moors above Spinningdale there is a track which runs
through more deep water troughs than I have seen in these tests before.
To the usual quota of steep climbs and drops, and bouldery burn
crossings, it adds an exceptionally glutinous surface of black
churned-up peat.
A convoy of Cherokees showed up remarkably well here. The extra ground
clearance of the turbo diesel versions paid off on the rougher
stretches, they coped easily with some bonnet-level water -- and, in the
case of the vehicle I was sharing, a bow-wave which once went right over
the roof. Feet-off-the-pedals descents saw it creep down with maximum
engine braking in low first gear, while low second was ideal for
charging up the slipperiest hills.
Adding a turbo diesel option is a shrewd move. However, right-hand
drive Cherokees are so popular in Japan that squeezing the TD models
into the UK supply will probably mean a reduction in the number of
petrol-powered examples available here this year.

If you want to look sharp this spring, suit yourself, advises
Francesca Fearon, but don't worry about appearing masculine -- the
nineties version of the sophisticated forties-inspired silhouette gets a
softly feminine spin from fabrics that stretch and shine
A YEAR ago in a post-collection television interview Vivienne Westwood
spoke out against the addiction for comfort dressing. She declared it a
lazy attitude that is proving the death of style. Ms Westwood doesn't
pull her punches, but her views prove to be a timely clarion call to
designers. At the spring fashion shows last October, the brisk tailored
silhouette had usurped those droopy waifish layers and glamour had
become the glorious new G-word.
The new tailored glamour most noticeably masqueraded under the guise
of nostalgia. Designers played dial-a-decade, calling up the silhouettes
of the forties, fifties and sixties, adding little hats, gloves,
chocolate box handbags and high heels -- the essential accoutrements of
the well-groomed woman of the period.
Then to provide a conduit for their retro-chic message, they evoked
rich images of the past, most particularly Hollywood movie queens of the
post-war period such as Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe
and Grace Kelly.
The forties suit was the strongest look to emerge from the spring
collections. Strip off the catwalk artifice and there, beneath the
retro-styling, is a fresh modern image. This was exhibited by Valentino,
Alberta Ferretti, Yves St Laurent and Calvin Klein. They poached the
clean utilitarian silhouette, then added modern construction and the
latest fabrics to arrive at some of the most sophisticated styles of the
season.
These designers captured the austere post-war look in military style
belted jackets and A-line skirts that grazed the knee. Yet, far from
producing a pastiche, they softened the masculine tailoring by giving it
a feminine nineties spin with fabrics that stretch and shine.
Ferretti cut the forties suit in a heavy navy and white satin,
creating a subtle deluxe look. Gaultier switched the rough wool skirt
for a bias-cut satin. Valentino narrowed the skirt to a sexy pencil-slim
style, moved the pockets to the hips of the jacket and compensated for
the rigorous (super-restrictive) line by cutting the belted suit in
stretch tweed.
The whip-thin belt is the focal point of the forties suit, bringing
the waistline back into fashion. It conceals the waist-seam (a
constructive detail that transforms the suit into a waspie silhouette)
and makes a feature of feminine hourglass curves. Red, white or black
patent are the glossy modern choice for the more severe tweed and
dogtooth check styles, while pastel suedes match the sugar almond
colours of the more feminine versions.
Some of the most alluring renditions of the forties look to emerge for
spring came in the debut collection of British duo Pearce Fionda.
Although inspired by traditional methods of tailoring, Ren Pearce and
Andrew Fionda have mastered extraordinary spiral and bias-cutting
techniques, akin to couture, to soften the masculine forties shape.
THE post-war decade is a rich source of inspiration for the two: ''We
wanted to accomplish the sophisticated glamour of the era,'' explains
Ren Pearce (who formerly worked with John Galliano). But their look is
not textbook nostalgia. ''As part of the design process, we were taught
to research, but not to consciously look back,'' he says.
''The thing is to make it look nineties -- which a lot of designers
are not doing -- it has to be styled in a modern way,'' adds Andrew
Fionda. ''Some ideas look so forties, but fabric technology brings them
back to the present day.''
They cut satin-backed crepe jackets with precision darting, ensuring
they fit close to the body then flip out with a peplum at the back.
Sleeves are cut short, forties-style -- to be worn over puff-sleeved
cropped shirts -- or extend over the little finger, in a finely honed
point. Skirts are A-line and to the knee, while trousers are lush,
Bergmanesque palazzo style.
This powerful retro-influence, though, has swept far beyond the
designer collections. Mondi has designed sophisticated versions in
white, yellow or red, updated with embroidered chiffon sleeves.
The excuse to dress up again has similarly inspired chain stores such
as Jigsaw, Oasis, Kookai and Warehouse, who are brushing up their
tailoring skills to produce shapely forties jackets and skintight
skirts. Oasis has caught the mood brilliantly with a nifty
charcoal-coloured suit, crisp shirt and skinny belt. Seamed hosiery and
high heels suggest a grown up style and bobby sox make it young and
sensible.
In fact, these accessories draw attention to the underlying message of
this season's retro revival -- glamorous dressing requires greater
discipline and a strong dose of irony.

THE Prime Minister, banished from Scotland's screens the night before
after a vote of no confidence in the Beeb by Scottish judges, was absent
again yesterday at Westminster. Interring the ''special relationship''
over three hours of talks with President Clinton may not be much more
fun than swopping soundbites with Mr Blair, but at least it's a change.
The courts being unable to stop politicians talking about politics in
Parliament, it was business as usual, although Mr John Prescott did the
business for Labour in a battle of the stand-ins. Mr Prescott, who has a
fascinating but wayward way with the English language, didn't bother to
disguise the fact he was reading it out.
The Government was preparing to bribe us with our own money, he
mouthed carefully, managing a bit of a crescendo as he came to the
soundbite proper ''when it comes to tax, you can never trust a Tory.''
One can see the slogan on the election posters now.
Mr Major's briefing team did well by Mr Tony Newton, the Commons
Leader, giving him various statistics which showed that people are
better- off now, even with this week's tax rises. These statistics are
not going to prove so useful if voters decide they don't believe them.
With some such thought in mind, Mr Ian Davidson (Govan -- Lab.) asked
Mr Newton if he anticipated a vote of confidence in the Government in
tomorrow's Scottish local elections. Mr Newton was not such a chump as
to say ''yes''. He made the hopeful assertion that the Scots would focus
on the fact that Conservative councils cost less and give better value
for money.
Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay -- Unwhipped Tory) asked Mr Newton to
share her delight that the Federation of Small Businesses had carried a
vote of no confidence in the European Union, and said they wanted to
leave. Mr Newton politely said he could not be as ecstatic about that as
she, though he understood their concern about excessive interference and
over-regulation.
Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow -- Unwhipped Tory) found this not good
enough and, trying nursery language to see if that made it easier for Mr
Newton, cried that ''The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker''
were fed up with over-regulation. He meant, he said, people ''who get up
in the morning to make something and to do something,'' a pretty wide
definition. Mr Newton, mindful of the Government's need of the votes of
the whipless ones, agreed that subsidiarity and deregulation were of
great importance.
The real fireworks came at 3.30pm, a time when MPs under the guise of
the points of order to the Speaker seek to air grievances or even score
political points. Miss Boothroyd does not approve of this even if
procedural sharp practice almost qualifies as a tradition of the House.
Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr -- Con.) who wanted to complain that, once again,
he said, he had been misquoted by his great adversary, Mr George Foulkes
(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley -- Lab.) had hardly got going before
Miss Boothroyd told him she was not interested in political squabbles
that took place in the Scottish Grand Committee and that his point of
order was an abuse of the House.
Sir Robert Dunn (Dartford -- Con.) was shot down in even shorter order
when he accused a Labour Member of misrepresenting the activities of his
local council.
It was a bold man indeed who would try a point of order after that.
However, Mr Peter Brooke (City of London and Westminster South -- Con.)
was not only brave but extremely angry. The object of his wrath was
Golden Virginia Bottomley, who had decided that the better part of
valour in announcing the closure of several London hospitals including
the world-famous Barts, was to do so by means of a written answer to a
planted question.
The next time a Secretary of State closed a hospital that was nearly
900 years old, foamed Mr Brooke, himself a former Cabinet Minister, the
Secretary of State should have the moral courage to announce it from the
despatch box. Mrs Bottomley joined the Scottish Conservative Party as an
object in whose immediate future it is hard to have much confidence.

IAN Brown's gut-wrenching production of life down among Edinburgh's
young drug addicts has finally hit London and if the Bush Theatre's
audience is anything to go by, has already found its natural home.
Forget the difference between tough Edinburgh vernacular and the south,
forget the difference between lifestyles.
The under-thirtysomethings in this audience knew exactly, even shared
(if that's not too emotive a word in the circumstances) the world author
Irvine Welsh and Ewan Bremner's quasi-narrator Mark are coming from.
They loved the insipient anarchy of it, they groaned with the desperate
degradation of it, and they thrilled to the dramatic energy of it.
Bremner as the ''drying-out'' junkie Mark is again outstanding. This
actor has a way of conveying vulnerability, nervous energy, and
rebellion all in the flick of those elongated fingers. But James
Cunningham's ravaged Tommy, Susan Vidler as Alison, and Malcolm
Shields's terrifying portrait of bully boy and mafioso, Franco, equally
make the blood run cold.
Audiences may find the temporary entertainment in the ribaldry adaptor
Harry Gibson, Brown and the cast have managed to draw out of this story
of hopelessness and human waste. But there's no mistaking the lessons --
death by a hundred cuts -- and the rage beneath. If I have a criticism,
it is that the humour in a sense, lets us, the audience, off the hook.
Mark's rehabilitation and recovery from such abuse, too, seems
remarkably speedy. But those quibbles apart, it remains a theatrical
stunner -- a harrowing testament to a generation. Trainspotting should
be required viewing in every London borough and throughout the land, one
of the most important plays the Bush has ever presented.

AFTER all the hubris and the huffing and puffing, Sebastian Barry's
resuscitation of one of his forebears, his great grandfather Thomas
Dunne who was the last Catholic head, in 1922, of the Dublin police
force, is an act not just of personal reconciliation but tremendous
theatrical and spiritual beauty as well. Imagine, an Irishman with an
ancestor whose whole being was tied up with loyalty to the British
Crown! It's enough to send a present-day Sinn Fein councillor into a
spin.
But this new play by Barry for Max Stafford Clark's Out of Joint
stable is of superb imaginative strength, touched even with greatness.
As Donal McCann's old Tommy lies in bed with the ghost of his young son,
Willie, killed in the trenches beside him,we are witness to a moment of
dramatic alchemy.
This is a play, about one man's relationship to history and himself,
is also a play that shows why Ireland and its literary heritage is known
the world over. McCann's rich, gravelled voice caresses the words,
exactly parallelling the spirit that informs the core of this play --
the deep swell of affection a father bears for his children. Equally,
Barry's love of Ireland, its countryside, its touch, and its smells is
present throughout.
The play has its sentimental side. Tommy is set before us at his most
vulnerable -- a broken old man locked up in a poor house looking back
through a memory coloured by the rosy hue of self-delusion. Yet such is
the clarity of Stafford Clark's direction and the lyrical tenderness of
Barry's images of regret, the Steward of Christendom becomes a veritable
hymn to cultural as well as childhood loss.

Michael Tumelty speaks to the Scottish tenor who had to spend half the
night at the opera on stage with his trousers down.
SCOTTISH tenorAlasdair Elliott confessed that, at the end of the
first-night performance of Alfred Schnittke's opera, Life with an Idiot,
in which Elliot plays Vova, the idiot of the title, he was ''completely
spaced out; on another planet''.
No wonder. There isn't another role in the entire operatic repertoire
like this one. ''I've never come across anything like it in my life,''
said Elliott, fully recovered from the opening-night British premiere of
the opera last Saturday at the Coliseum in London. ''It is a one-off.''
Not half, it is. On stage, Elliott as Vova has to spend half the night
with his trousers down, brandishing an enormous tumescent penis; he has
to defecate into a bucket and throw faeces at the wall; he has to
masturbate, swing from a chandelier, violently sodomise a wife and
husband in turn, get the woman pregnant and repeatedly beat her up,
ultimately decapitating her and attempting to rip her body in two by the
legs.
And all the while he sings, wordlessly. In Schnittke's setting of
Victor Erofeyev's short story -- a grotesque and violent allegory about
the monster of the communist state (and the beast within us all) -- Vova
is monosyllabic. He has one expression only -- Ekh! (pronounced Ech) --
an utterance which, said tenor Alasdair Elliott, ''means nothing and has
to mean everything''.
The problems with the vocal aspects of the role are immense, said
Elliott. The actual range the voice has to cover is huge -- two and a
half octaves. ''I couldn't go higher than that,'' he said.
Then there's the interpretation. Without actual words to sing, how do
you know what it means?
''The voyage of discovery here has been to find out what emotion lies
behind each utterance of 'Ekh','' said Elliott. ''In a sequence where
Vova has nightmares, the vocal line arches, almost wailing.
''And later, in the masturbation scene, I have to sing 19 high Bs in a
row -- it's really violent, needing a different kind of attack, and the
problem is to protect the voice,'' he said. ''If you were not secure
technically, you could do a lot of damage to your voice with this role:
there are no consonants to anchor the voice on to.''
Vocal difficulties aside, the character of Vova is complex. Who is he?
What is his function? Taken into their home from the asylum by a husband
and wife who believe him to be placid, Vova destroys the house, their
relationship, and, eventually, the wife herself.
Alasdair Elliott, made-up like a mock-up of Lenin (whose nickname was
Vova) and costumed in a clown-like suit, underplays the role, so that,
when he does erupt, the violence -- though often cartoon-like -- is
horrifying. But there is never an impression that Vova is a calculating,
manipulative psychopath.
''Jonathan Moore (the director) and I decided that we'd let Vova react
to situations rather than lead them,'' said Elliott. ''Vova is cracking
open things that are there already. There's a feeling that the husband
and wife's marriage is sexually barren. She is fatally attracted by
Vova's large penis (as is the husband) and Vova reacts to this.
''And when the wife gets pregnant by Vova, and then has an abortion,
he reacts to that too by beating her up. He's not leading. He is
however, an animalistic sex machine.''
Which raises the question of the appendage. At about two feet in
length, it's hardly discreet. ''We had a long talk about this.'' said
Elliott. ''We decided to have something absurd rather than realistic.''
Black humour permeates the production itself, and hilarity invaded the
rehearsals, said Elliott, recalling the ''half-length practice penis
flapping about'' and provoking uproar among the cast.
Similarly with the bedroom scene featuring Vova and the nameless wife
performing feats of sexual acrobatics on a bed whose characteristics
resemble more a trampoline. (Circus symbolism pervades the second act.)
''I've never laughed so much in a production, trying to get that
right,'' said Elliott, recalling the bed bouncing the couple out of
control while they tried to time their highly energetic movements to
Schnittke's music. ''The music suggests three orgasms with a huge final
release,'' said Elliott.
Humour apart -- and Life with an Idiot, coming straight out of the
tradition of the Theatre of the Absurd, is very funny -- Alasdair Elliot
strikes several cautionary notes. The first is personal. The role of
Vova is a once in a career display opportunity for a singer. ''It is
immensely enjoyable to do,'' said Elliott. ''But I watch this part
carefully. There is a risk of Vova taking over and the singer losing
control. There's so much violence and movement that it could be
dangerous for yourself and your colleagues.
''In the scene where I'm beating up the wife, which is very ugly, if I
was to let go I'd knock her block off. When I'm punching her in the
kidneys -- and we're doing it in a very stylised way -- I'm actually
punching her and stopping just short. If I let go I'd kill her.''
And he is quite explicit in his own warning to the public. (The
publicity for the opera carries a warning about the graphic nature of
the physical and sexual violence, and the foul language used.) ''It is a
deeply disturbing work,'' said Alasdair Elliott. ''People who are going
to be offended shouldn't go.
''This is a very different experience from La Boheme. It is not the
kind of opera that everyone will want to see. The two companies, English
National and Scottish Operas, have warned people. I wouldn't necessarily
encourage some of my own family to come and see it.''

TWO Conservative MPs face suspension from the House of Commons without
pay, and are likely to be formally reprimanded as a result of the
''cash-for- questions'' affair.
The senior Commons Privileges Committee yesterday announced its
verdict that Mr David Tredinnick MP for Bosworth, and Mr Grahan Riddick,
MP for Colne Valley, were prepared to table Commons questions for #1000.
The MPs were among twenty approached by Sunday Times journalists
during an investigation. Another, Mr
Bill Walker, Conservative MP for North Tayside -- who the committee
said ''acted unwisely'' but recommended that no action be taken against
in asking for a donation to a charity -- accused the newspaper of using
entrapment techniques.
MPs are expected after Easter to confirm recommended bans of 20
working days on Mr Tredinnick and 10 on Mr Riddick. This will further
hamper the Governmenmt, already in a minority with nine Tory Euro-rebels
operating as independents.
The all-party committee also criticised the methods of the Sunday
Times, which it said should be examined by the Press Complaints
Commission. They had ''fallen ''substantially below the standards to be
expected of legitimate investigative journalism.'' However, the Sunday
Times Insight team which exposed the affair last night won two British
Press Awards.
The allegations against the MPs were published last July after Sunday
Times journalists posed as businessmen to offer a number of MPs cash in
return for tabling questions to Ministers.
Their use of secretly tape recorded conversations at Westminster was
criticised by the committee as a ''contempt'' of the House. An inquiry
into the use of tape-recorders in the precincts will be launched by the
Commons Administration Committee.
A backbench MP receives a salary of #33,189 -- which works out at
#90.93 a day -- and so Mr Tredinnick wil; lose #1818 and Mr Riddick #909
while their salaries are docked.
Labour MPs on the committee are believed to have wanted tougher
sentences but the Government majority dissented,.
Mr Tredinnick -- who comes from a wealthy Cornish tin mining family
and has an Eton, Oxford and Grenadier Guards background -- said he would
reserve his comments for the Commons debate, but added:
''I have clearly made mistakes and I recognise that. It is my
intention to apologise to my colleagues at the appropriate time in the
Commons Chamber.''
Mr Riddick, educated at a state school and Warwick University and once
a me Coca-Cola salesman, said he would refrain from comment until he had
thoroughly studied the report.
He received a lighter penalty apparently because he had second
thoughts and returned the cheque he had been sent before the transaction
was exposed.
A right-winger he considerably increased his majority in the usually
marginal Colne Valley seat which he became the first Conservative ever
to represent in 1992.
Following press reports of the personal misfortunes of Conservative
Ministers, he referred to journalists as ''vultures.''
Both he and Mr Tredinnick resigned their unpaid posts as Parliamentary
Private Secretaries to Ministers following the Sunday Times disclosures.
Recommending that no action be taken in Mr Walker's case, the
committee report states: ''There is no reason to think that Mr Walker
ever intended to accept any personal financial reward by tabling
parliamentary questions.
''Indeed he agreed to seek the information Mr Calvert (a Sunday Times
journalist) wanted before any suggestion of payment was made.''
Mr Walker subsequently suggested that Mr Calvert make any payment to
the Air Cadet Vintage Glider Memorial Flight Trust Fund, for which at
the time he was raising cash.
He told the committee he did not believe the suggestion was linked to
his asking the Commons question. ''At the time, I was signing letters
which were going out to lots of people at the same time as this fellow
tried to produce a cheque book. I thought: if that bloke has got money
to throw around, I have got a charity that is desperately looking for
money.''
He said last night: ''I am disappointed the committee did not take
action against the Sunday Times journalists because the one that came to
see me was acting as an agent provocateur.''
He said the paper had only taped or produced tapes of the converations
that suited the angle from which it wanted to write their story.''This
was designed to entrap and I believe it has done an enormous disservice
to the media.''
Of the committee's conclusion about him, he said ''I have no
complaint. They have said Bill Walker is human. He made an error of
judgment. I admit my human failings . I didn't suspect anything. I
believed this chap was what he said he was.''
Mr Richard Ellis, the Sunday Times managing editor (News) said ''What
we did was expose something which, had we not used the methods we did,
would not have come to light.
''The action the committee has taken against the MPs shows this was
something which did need to come to light. The Sunday Times used the
methods which were clearly right and proper at the time.''
The newspaper said last night's press awards -- for Team Journalism of
the Year and Exclusive of the Year -- made Insight the first
journalistic team to receive two accolades in the 25-year history of the
awards.
0 Sunday Times editor John Witherow said: ''This has been a triumphant
day for the Insight team.''
However, Sir James Spicer, Tory MP for Dorset West and a member of the
privileges committee, described the behaviour of the Sunday Times as
''pretty frightful''.
He believed the journalists had got off lightly.
''They started out saying they were looking for a form of
consultancy,'' he said on BBC Radio 4.
''It all sounded very plausible and it is just possible that if one
didn't think too long and hard about it, one might have gone down that
road with them.''
Labour MP Dr John Garrett, who recently published a book on Commons
procedure, said: ''I think the penalties should have been rather more
severe.
''I don't think that 10 days' and 20 days' suspension is really
enough, but it does put a shot across the bows of anybody else thinking
of doing it.''
Labour's Tony Benn, expelled from the committee last December for
publishing his own minutes of its private hearings, told the BBC: ''It's
a very disappointing report. I'm afraid it's what I expected.
''You find a couple of scapegoats and you give them a minor rebuke,
and you say absolutely nothing about the real question, about what are
the duties of an MP.''
Liberal Democrat national heritage spokesman Bob Maclennan welcomed
the outcome of the inquiry.
''This case illustrates the importance of MPs taking responsibility
for their own actions to protect the good name of Parliament,'' he said.
''The press may make mistakes of judgment, but journalists' freedom to
investigate is a vital protection against the abuse of power.''

IN his article, Class war comes to Labour, John MacCalman has failed
to mention that there are a number of existing councillors from the old
Glasgow District Council who belonged to neither of the alleged factions
and who made up their own minds on issues and didn't, still won't,
slavishly follow either of the personalities mentioned (March 30).
He doesn't consider the councillors from Strathclyde region who
obviously did not figure in the internal politics on the district.
He does not seem to have considered the candidates from the Labour
Party who are fighting seats for the first time and who will bring a
whole variety of talents from diverse backgrounds into Glasgow politics
when elected.

THREE rounds have been fought over the BBC's proposal to show a
Panorama interview with John Major just before the Scottish local
authority elections; the result is exactly what should have happened in
the first place. The interview will not be shown before the elections
and all parties have retired to consider in greater depth the issues
raised. The BBC in London should be eternally grateful to the Scottish
judges for refusing the corporation leave to appeal to the House of
Lords. As Lord Hope made clear, a case had been made for the granting of
an interim interdict which would allow the issues raised to be
considered in depth. Attempting to hustle the court, and then the House
of Lords, into a snap judgment which would either have upheld the
interdict or rejected it, was the wrong way to proceed. Nor would it
have done anything for the duty to properly examine the issues and
arguments raised. More seriously, the contention by the BBC that the
issue should be dealt with in the House of Lords so that the programme
could be broadcast before the elections, and before it lost its
topicality, is a flagrant refusal to acknowledge even the possibility of
error. Lord Hope's comment that the closer the broadcast came to the
election, the stronger the case of a risk of prejudice, is simple
commonsense.
We are left, after all the legal thunderflashes, smoke, and lightning
of the past days, with the uneasy possibility that the judgment of the
BBC in London on matters of political impartiality could be either
flawed or capable of coercion. This is a hard thing to say, and in doing
so it must be acknowledged that the BBC has a particularly difficult
path to follow, given the strength of the requirement for strict
impartiality under which it works. Nevertheless, the conjunction of
abuse of the BBC by senior Conservative politicians, and the decision to
broadcast the suspiciously sudden interview with the Prime Minister, is
worrying. It matters not a whit in England where the local authority
elections are some weeks off; it matters a very great deal in Scotland
with the elections taking place tomorrow. The argument that the Panorama
broadcast would have been in proportion with the television exposure
offered to the other party leaders in Scotland is simply nonsense.
Panorama is the BBC's flagship current-affairs programme; none of the
other party leaders was offered an appearance on it so close to the
Scottish election.
Other, very peculiar, arguments have been deployed in an attempt to
criticise the decision of the Scottish courts. Some have suggested that
the interview with the Prime Minister was so uninspiring that it could
have been shown safely without the possibility of swaying voters. This,
if it is not a joke, is extremely silly. Whether the BBC in London
appreciates the gravity of what it has attempted is quite another
matter. Our initial opinion was too harsh on BBC staff in Scotland. We
are happy to acknowledge that the staff in Glasgow did advise London of
the folly of its ways. Nevertheless, their opinions were ignored, and
this in itself says a good deal about the arrogance of BBC London and
the relative powerlessness of BBC Scotland. Until that balance is
redressed, and until the BBC lives up to its intentions to devolve
proper decision-making to what it quaintly calls the national regions,
the possibility of similar mistakes will remain.

FLOORING is a big investment, but there are some key points which can
help you make the most of your money if you bear them in mind. Stuart
Beattie, whose interior design company specialises in refurbishing
hotels, provides a quick consumers' guide to floor coverings, outlining
the best materials for every room in the house, and the main ways to
keep costs to the minimum.
''If you're one of those people who move house every few years, laying
premier grade wool carpeting wall to wall is likely to be a poor
investment. It's unlikely to fit your new home when you move, and the
next owner of your present home probably won't share your taste, and
will be reluctant to pay much for your expensive carpeting if you have
to leave it behind,'' Stuart said.
''On the other hand, professionally laid premier quality wall-to-wall
wool carpeting will give both unashamed luxury and top performance as a
durable floor covering, so in the right situation it's a superb
long-term investment.''
Rugs and carpets add warmth to a room, protect the floors and muffle
sound, which is an important point, especially in flats.
There are five basic carpet textures -- cut pile velour, cord and
twist, shag and carved, which has a textural, three-dimensional pattern.
Velour looks like velvet, is the grandest of the range, but shows
footprints and traffic patterns.
Cord and twist pile carpets are easy to clean, robust and
comparatively inexpensive. They wear well, but generally don't look
luxurious or feel bouncy underfoot. Shag looks casual and comfortable,
but it can flatten in patches if the tufts are too long.
There is also Saxony, which is somewhere between a velour and shag,
and bonded carpeting. Bonded carpets are fine for bedrooms and
light-traffic areas -- they are not looped under the weave, the fibres
are bonded into place instead, and although this saves around 30% on
fibre needed in manufacture and reduces the cost, bonded carpets won't
last so long.
''You need best quality carpet where it gets the hardest wear --
especially in the hall and on the stairs,'' Stuart advises. ''In fact,
you should use the best contract quality you can afford on stairs,
because money saved here often turns out to be money wasted. Carpet that
covers the full width of the stairs looks superb, but it is extravagant,
because the carpet will wear on the edge of the treads, and you won't be
able to move it to spread the wear because it won't fit the turns.
Choose carpet which is as wide as possible, but keep the same width
throughout, allowing an extra 18 inches rolled up at the bottom and top
so that you can move it up or down as it starts to wear.''
Wool carpets are resilient, warm and hard wearing, but to make them
really last, you need good underlay. For quiet, extra bounce underfoot,
and to protect your investment, make sure that your carpet is laid on a
hard-wearing underlay. If you want carpeting, but don't want to invest
in wool, consider the acrylics, polyesters and nylon alternatives. Some
are tough and easy to clean, and will give good service in the right
situation with a good underlay.
''There are some tips which will help you choose the right floor
covering for each situation,'' Stuart said. ''In theory, light and dark
colours show stains most, but I've found that the colours that show the
dirt least are dark brown and dark green.''
If you want a really easy-to-care floor covering, Stuart suggests you
choose a water-resistant material which can be washed with a mop, water
and detergent. New style vinyls fit the bill and look stunning in
kitchens, bathrooms, dining rooms, playrooms, utility rooms and halls.
Linoleum, cork and rubber are also hard-wearing, good-looking and easy
to keep clean.
Vinyl has the advantage of being quiet as well as easy to clean.
Linoleum is grease resistant and easy to lay, but needs to be waxed to
protect the surface. Cork tiles are soft and warm underfoot, but not
really suitable in areas of heavy traffic, or in kitchens or bathrooms
unless coated with a clear vinyl film.
''If you are looking for a material which will really last, some floor
coverings have a longer life expectancy -- ceramic and clay are good for
bathrooms and kitchens, but tough on dropped crockery and cold and hard
underfoot,'' Stuart said. ''Slate, marble and terrazzo are also used for
domestic flooring, and although they have the advantages of being
handsome and durable, they are expensive and difficult to install.''
Consider wood flooring if you want a natural material which will
improve with age, provided it is looked after. Beech is the flooring to
choose if you want a neutral base to a room, with a slightly red and
mature warm tone. Spruce looks good in kitchens, bathrooms, halls and
dining rooms because of its classical yellow-white colour tone and
abundance of knots.
Birch is the Scandinavian favourite, it's perfect with Nordic interior
furnishing styles because its lustre gives an interesting optical
effect. There is an extra-durable variant which has a top layer
compressed under extremely high pressure, which makes it resist
indentation and ideal for heavy traffic areas in the home.
Some environmentally conscious suppliers use wood species from
replanted forests instead of wood from the rainforests, and wood floors
can be sanded and refinished after years of heavy wear, making them
especially attractive to environmentally conscious householders, who
want to make the best use of natural resources and avoid adding flooring
discarded after a few years' wear to the mountains of rubbish around our
cities.
''Natural fibre floor coverings are increasingly popular in both
domestic settings and in public buildings,'' Stuart said. ''Sisal,
seagrass, coir, jute and cotton are all used to manufacture floor
coverings which are hard-wearing, with excellent anti-static qualities
and are also relatively easy to keep clean.
''Some companies have them available in 13ft widths, and in a range of
designs and colours, which can be close fitted to give a similar effect
to wall-to-wall carpeting. Seagrass is one of the most versatile of
these natural floor coverings. It's available in a light to medium
contract quality, and widely used in showrooms, galleries, museums,
restaurants and offices, so it will be suitable for many situations at
home, and you can add mats to provide protection in areas of heavy
wear.''

THE Scotch whisky industry has tried very hard to sell into the
Japanese market but has met with constant obstruction. The Japanese like
whisky very much and even make their own version but it is widely
recognised to be inferior by most Japanese consumers who prefer the real
thing. They might eventually be more able to get it in their glasses now
that the European Union is backing Scotch makers and making preliminary
moves at the World Trade Organisation to challenge the offical Japanese
discrimination against Scotch. The WTO is the old Gatt, but with much
sharper teeth. It will need them; the Japanese are long-game players. In
this case they are likely to be particularly obdurate since whisky
competes directly with a locally produced drink, Schochu, which enjoys
generous fiscal protection and whose makers are well organised to defend
a system which taxes whisky between four and seven times as much as
their own product. The WTO cannot, however, compel the Japanese
Government to act in the way it would like, but it does enjoy a powerful
authority in world trade matters and the Japanese would not want to
treat it in an other than serious and respectful way. The new body is
thought to be possessed of more clout than its predecessor, and this
will be a test case of its ability to ensure the free trade to which it
is committed by the agreement of its supporters -- most of the world's
sovereign states, including Japan.
Indeed the Japanese are the beneficiaries of the free-trade
assumptions which underlie the WTO; and were anything comparable to the
system of protection which sustains Schochu maintained in Japan's export
markets the noise would be deafening. In the case of whisky it is eight
years since the Japanese authorities themselves admitted that the
existing fiscal arrangments had to be altered in respect of spirituous
liquors. They intended then to move towards a position where such drinks
were treated equally by the tax system. They have failed to do so, and
while some continuing discrimination in favour of the home product might
have been ignored, such a large degree of protection cannot.
The Scotch Whisky Association is pleased at the EU's move, though not
all the antics of the Union are so endearing -- the proposal of the
Commission to treat whisky as a dangerous liquid when being moved by
road tended to drive makers to apoplexy. The Japanese market -- and
others in the Far East -- have enormous potential: whisky there enjoys a
status which it has lost at home (often to competing American spirits as
far as younger consumers are concerned). Whisky which was a drink
designed to keep cold damp environments at bay seems to be especially
comfortable with hot climes: it has been selling particularly well in
Iberia and Greece, for example. It has become a ''snob'' drink almost
everywhere, and the Japanese are particularly fond of its premium
varieties, single malts, long aged or specially vatted. The industry, an
example of outstanding manufacturing, is now also well packaged and
marketed. It can be sold, as it is, with skill and determination,
despite the disappointing results this week from Highland Distillers,
but it is most easily sold where the famous playing field is indeed
level. In Japan the present gradient against it is reminiscent of Mount
Fuji.

LIBERAL Democrat Defence spokesman Menzies Campbell last night
expressed disappointment at a Government decision to relocate the RAF's
rescue co-ordination centre from Pitreavie in Fife to Morayshire.
Hopes had been high locally that the centre would stay in Fife, being
relocated from RAF Pitreavie Castle to RAF Leuchars.
However, citing recent studies, Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames
said yesterday in a Commons written answer that ''substantial
operational advantages and cost savings would be gained'' by moving the
operation to RAF Kinloss in Morayshire.
Mr Campbell, MP for North-East Fife, said last night: ''It represents
a complete change of mind by the Government. Last July, Ministers took
credit for the fact that the centre was to be relocated from Pitreavie
to Leuchars.
''Now after nine months of rumour, the Government has reversed that
decision for reasons which are neither persuasive nor compelling.''
While the National Military Rescue Co-ordination Centre, along with 36
posts, will transfer to RAF Kinloss, the Air Officer Scotland and
Northern Ireland, the most senior RAF post in Scotland, will move to RAF
Leuchars.
Pitreavie Castle is staffed mainly by RAF and Navy personnel and
employs only a small number of civilians.

HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley incurred the wrath of senior Tory
MPs last night over the way she announced a raft of key decisions on the
future of health care in London.
At least two MPs were provoked into warning the whips that the
Government would no longer be able to rely on their votes when it came
to health matters in the capital, reducing Ministers' already precarious
majority in the House.
Former Cabinet Minister Peter Brooke told the Commons Mrs Bottomley
should have had the ''moral courage'' to announce her decisions in
person to the House, rather than in a written reply.
THE Government has given a partial concession to island MPs on the
extension of vehicle excise duty. Under the new proposals lorries up to
17 tonnes registered on islands which do not have plating and testing
facilities will continue to pay up to #150. However, Treasury Minister
David Heathcote-Amory refused to extend the concession to larger
vehicles. Mr Heathcote-Amory told MPs larger vehicles registered on the
islands but travelling outside port areas on the mainland would be
liable to full duty, which ranges as high as #5000.
AYRSHIRE Labour MP George Foulkes has tabled a Commons motion
defending the social workers involved in the Ayrshire child abuse case
and calling for an end to the ''media campaign'' against them. The
motion has been seconded by other West of Scotland MPs, including Willie
McKelvey, Brian Donohoe and Norman Godman. By last night 10 Labour MPs
had signed it.

TO this set of ears, country music + MOR rock = naff. Which is why
I've never managed to buy into the ''new country'' scene. And that is
exactly what we were served in generous portions last night.
First up was Deana Carter, who seems aesthetic enough.
Nashville-raised, friends with Waylon Jennings, she bounced on stage
cooing, ''It's really good to be here with Y'all.'' She sang of lost
love and depression, and the acoustic stuff was great, but the band . .
. I mean, did she really need a guitarist who in black leather trousers,
head band and a penchant for guitar solos, was like a sixth form Slash?
She was at her best when the irony shone through, as it does in all good
country. Did I Shave My Legs For This is not only a classic title but a
classic tune.
Then on came Jimmy Nail, six foot something, dressed in black, and
although not wearing crocodile shoes (the audience would have liked
that) he was wearing something resembling cowboy boots. With a stage-set
of picket fences set against the backdrop of an urban landscape, Jimmy
Nail is a midnight cowboy for the nineties.
He took us through his albums, all the hits, and a couple of cover
versions. With his paper-thin voice, the stage presence of a mike stand,
and uninspiring musical arrangements, Nail is one of those unfathomable
nineties phenomenons -- the cult of the personality -- but it must be
said that he had the audience in his hands every step of the way.
As an encore, Jimmy and the band gathered around the front of the
stage for a little unplugged session. Which was great, but there it
should have stopped before it fell apart with a shambolic rendition of
Scotland the Brave and High-Heeled Sneakers.

INVISIBLE Bouncers Theatre Company's version of the legend of Macbeth
takes as many liberties as Shakespeare's script did but is probably more
faithful to the facts. Writer Ike Isaksen postulates that if he could
reign over Scotland for 17 peaceful and prosperous years then he was no
coward, and takes us on a pyschological exploration of his heroic
qualities. Murray Dawson plays him as a sort of Mad Mac, with a mixture
of revenge-fuelled bloodlust, likable humour, and great stature.
An ensemble company garbed in asexual costumes, an amalgam of Celtic
warrior and futuristic chic, sprawl across a massive rough-hewn set
which demands intense physicality as they have to shimmy up 18ft towers
and constantly transform the terrain by shifting huge blocks around.
This design by Iain M Campbell is ingeniously planned but the constant
scene-shifting can be distracting, even though these bits of stage
business are incorporated into the ad-hoc performance style, with the
actors cheerily swaggering rather than creeping surreptitiously around
in a blackout.
Such touches give the production a robust energy which is engaging,
but this raw power paradoxically highlights both the strengths and
weaknesses of the project; many of the scenes, especially some
stunningly choreographed fight sequences, unleash great dramatic
potential but others seem too rambling and reliant on ad-libbed company
camaraderie.
The history of Macbeth's life is traced through a series of set pieces
with little narrative fluidity, other than that provided by Macbeth's
''spirit guide'' Arnor -- Steve Webb giving an excellent anchoring
performance. However, the fusion of Gaelic and Doric is impressively
managed and the musical accompaniment is superb.

INCONGRUOUS as it may have seemed even six months ago, the Boo Radleys
visit The Garage a mere two days after finding their new album, Wake Up,
sitting resplendent at the top of the UK album chart.
So what has given in these six months? A sea change in public taste or
a complete revision of strategy on the band's part? Well, on last
night's evidence it is probably both. Wake Up Boo is single of the year
so far, but few could have expected it to reach the mass consciousness
where previous Boo gems like Lazarus and Barney and Me had singularly
failed to register.
However Wake Up, which not surprisingly was the focus of viritually
all last night's set, shows a marked focusing of their direction. No
longer are they an obtuse art/rock combo with the odd moment of pop
genius, they are now a fully-fledged great pop band with only the odd
reference to a more obscure past.
Adding a new-found confidence in style to their ever-present energy
and musicality, I Hang Suspended, Barney and Me, and Stuck on Amber,
made for a formidable opening, but it was another recent, Joel, which
fully captured the greatness of the Boo Radleys in 1995.
It's Lulu, the new single, Find the Answer Within, and its predecessor
have an abdundance of big, trumpet-driven sing-along choruses, all of
which owe more than a little debt to their most illustrious and relevant
Liverpudlian antecedents, The Beatles and Pete Wylie.
Even when stripped back on the soulful Wilder, the songwriting still
startles and the only complaint can be the brevity of the set. To
paraphrase, the Boo Radleys, on current form, are ''God's Own Pop
Group''.

DOCTORS organising an airlift of sick Bosnian children to Britain for
vital hospital treatment have run out of money.
Twelve seriously ill children are trapped in the besieged town of
Bihac, Professor David Southall, one of the organisers of a Unicef
programme to bring children to the UK, said yesterday.
Professor Southall's team, based at Keele University, brought
12-year-old Menira Drace from Mostar to the Royal Hospital for Sick
Children in Glasgow, where she is recovering after a hole-in-the-heart
operation.
Professor Southall said he hopes to get companies or individuals to
sponsor children for the cost of their transport and subsistence.
They include children with brain tumours and heart conditions who,
like Menira, do not qualify for the UN medical evacuation programme
which only deals with children whose condition is immediately
life-threatening.
Professor Southall, who works at North Staffordshire Hospital in
Stoke, said 12 children from Mostar, including Menira, had been brought
over and eight of them had now gone home.
''We got the promise of 14 entry visas from the British Government,
and got consent to approach hospitals to take children for treatment
provided they could absorb the treatment costs in their budget,'' said
Professor Southall.
So far 12 of the visas have been used.
''This programme has now run out of money, but there are many more
children that we want to bring out,'' said Professor Southall. ''We have
a medical team in Bihac identifying them but we need financial help and
we need political clout to secure more visa slots.
''Until we get some more funds they will be stuck there.
''The cost of bringing a child and mother or other relative is
#1000-#2000.
''We still need sponsorship to support the last four from Mostar while
they are here, and our team in Bihac have identified another 12 who need
to be evacuated.''
Project co-ordinator Tony Willock said: ''Although the children's
problems are not immediately life-threatening, they are seriously
disturbing and damaging to the child's development.''
Donations can be sent to the Bosnian Children's Fund, Department of
Paediatrics, North Staffordshire Hospital, Stoke-On-Trent, ST4 6QG;
sponsorship can be arranged through the co-ordinators on tel 01782
715444, or fax 01782 713946.

MARRIAGE is a great institution but I'm not ready for an institution
yet, quipped the late, great Mae West. It's a sentiment I wholeheartedly
concur with, but my best friend Roz is ready to be committed. She's
signing up on Saturday for a lifetime of love and devotion, a
responsibility I find quite awesome. The responsibility of organising
her hen night was big enough for me.
Now your hen night is quite a difficult kettle of fish from your stag
night. They're not even in the same ballpark, or should that be
barnyard? There has to be a subtlety, a style, about a hen night which
the stag night lacks. I mean, the average stag night consists of men
drinking 22 pints of Guinness, ogling a stripper, and tying the ''stag''
to a lamppost, whereas the average hen night consists of women drinking
22 pints of Black Russian, ogling a stripper, and tying him to the
lamppost.
No hassle. I figured I was up to the task of compering an evening of
Bacchanalian excess. I planned a sensational riot of vulgarity and tack.
This proved problematic. It's hard to perfect a hen night when all your
pals are such frustratingly suss chicks. ''Karaoke!'' I announced. Roz
threw me daggers. ''A strippogram?'' I whispered. Roz threw me
poison-tipped javelins and spelled out the fact that any glimpse of a
G-stringed male would result in my instant excommunication from the
Church of Cool Chicks.
Suggestions of cocktails met with more furrowed brows. ''Look, I'm not
getting drunk,'' she assured me, a protestation which rang out as rather
fake considering that when I asked her what she would wear she replied:
''My black cocktail dress, 'cos it's easy to wash the sick stains off.''
That was more like it. A venue was agreed on -- a themed restaurant
which encourages raucous parties -- and the troops were rallied. We
sneakily decided to buy Roz a sex toy, something which would cover her
in embarrassment. Slight snag. As mistress of ceromonies I was
''volunteered'' to purchase said appliance. The only person who was
covered in embarrassment was me. I ended up lurking outside a suitably
saucy looking emporium, convinced that long-lost maiden aunts, my former
parish priest, and all my ex-boyfriends were hiding round the corner
giggling at me. My normally steely nerves melted under my red-hot
blushes and I failed to make it past the door.
A phone-around elicited outrageous stories of hen nights of
yesteryear; lots of tales of girls bedecked in streamers and collecting
pound notes for kisses. One friend had been on one where the bride
actually got dressed up as a hen and was stuffed into a supermarket
trolley and wheeled around every pub in her town. I considered hiring a
hen costume and stealing a trolley from Safeway's but, in my heart, I
knew Roz wouldn't thank me for it. I finally settled on lots of party
poppers and satiated my lust for something tacky with a mug which
featured a muscle-bulging torso and proclaimed ''I like mine hot and
steamy''. Roz gamely drank her wine out of it for some snaps then hid it
away.
Our dinner was fun but terribly tame. By contrast, across the
restaurant aisle, a parallel group were obviously auditioning for a
Willy Russell film, screeching at each other, goosing the waiter, and
caterwauling along to the remix version of Cindy Lauper's Girls Just
Wanna' Have Fun. Meanwhile, my mates were flinching from the party
sparklers I had plonked on their desserts. For a hen night we were a
bunch of chickens.
It was clearly a class thing and we were clearly too classy. Perhaps
we were also too old, young though we are. The stereotypical hen night,
with its accompanying unleashing of hysterical panic, is more
appropriate to the teenage bride, terrified of the commitment in front
of her and frantically trying to hang on to her youth with a last
extravagant girls' night out. She ends up snogging the face off a
stranger as a desperate litmus test of her devotion.
The twentysomething bride knows she is not about to foresake her
nights out with the gals. Her hen night is no mad final fling but a
joyous celebration, an assertion of confidence in her momentous
decision, which does not presage an abandonment of individuality. Roz
may be mad about Malcolm, her fiance, but she intends to keep her own
name. ''I'll always be Miss Roz Paterson, just like Miss Shirley
Bassey,'' she announced, a bizarre comparison which proves, as I have
always suspected, that a diva's heart beats beneath her demure
demeanour.
HER dinner was less about getting pointlessly paralytic and more about
relaxing with friends before a hectic week of dress and veil collecting,
leg waxing, manicures, haircuts, packing for Paris, and exhaustive
sessions with me where we try to perfect that tossing the bouquet
sequence . . . not that, ahem, I'd ready to jump the broomstick, you
understand, I'd rather fly it a while longer yet, but I thought I'd
better get into the spirit of things.
And later, in the course of the hen night, when our numbers had
whittled down to a trio sharing some gin and reminiscences I got into
the spirit of things more enthusiastically and insisted I be allowed to
make a speech at her wedding, balancing the male-dominated -- groom,
best man, and father-of-the-bride -- tone of the event. So now my nights
are sleepless as I panic about how I can ever eloquently or adequately
pay a tribute to Roz and Malcolm's love. Now, that really is a
responsibility.

<HEADLINE>Britain to withdraw its free-fall nuclear bombs</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S only free-fall nuclear bombs are to be withdrawn from
service by the end of 1998, ending the RAF's nuclear capability, it was
announced last night.
From then on, Britain's sole nuclear deterrent will be the Trident
submarine fleet.
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames announced the end of the bombs
in a Commons written reply, saying that the WE177 weapons will be
withdrawn from service by the end of 1998.
'''The Trident system will provide a continuously available
sub-strategic capability when the second submarine, HMS Victorious,
joins the patrol cycle around the end of this year and the capability
will be fully robust when HMS Vigilant enters service in 1998.
'''In the light of this, we have decided that the WE177 free-fall bomb
should be withdrawn from service by the end of 1998.''
Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark said: '''This is good news.
Labour has been pressing for this for some time. But the Government must
not use this to mask the fact we are still a nuclear power.
'''Trident has an increased nuclear capability, with far more warheads
than the Polaris system. We want the Government to restrict the number
of Trident warheads to 192 -- the same as on Polaris.''
The WE177 nuclear free-fall bomb and naval depth bomb were first
produced in the mid-1960s.
After the end of the Cold War, the Government decided to remove the
sub-strategic weapons from Royal Navy surface ships and RAF maritime
patrol aircraft. However, the free-fall bombs carried by Tornado strike
aircraft were updated.

''Geesabrek'', Molly Rorke should know, is the Scotticised Americanism
''Gimme a break'' (March 25).
The reason we can Scotticise it is due to the fact that we are all
taught standard English. If we were taught only a dialect of Scots,
American English would become as obscure to us as it is to the Belgians.
Standard English is a tool, a lingua franca, like Latin and French
before it.
Children were not chastised for saying ''kye'', they were chastised,
rather unimaginatively, for impertinence, perversity and time-wasting,
as they would have been had they insisted on being taught algebra during
the geometry lesson.
''Kye'', incidentally, is Old English, not exclusively Scottish, and
was used, for example, by Shakespeare as well as, of course, Burns.

FIFE museum curator Bob Bracegirdle travels 800-mile each fortnight to
become a matchday steward at his favourite football club -- Leicester
City.
He has made the 400-mile each-way trip to the Filbert Street home of
the Premiership strugglers since February last year, and has seen every
home game for the last three seasons.
He is paid just #12 a game to put on a green plastic steward's jacket
for City, but it costs him #60 in petrol for each 16-hour journey in his
Peugeot.
He said yesterday: ''I've been a Leicester fan since the early
seventies, and I'd much rather drive eight hours to watch City than my
local team East Fife.''
Mr Bracegirdle, 51, the #12,000-a-year curator of Fife's Scottish
National Fisheries Museum has clocked up nearly 12,000 miles this season
-- only to see his team relegated.
Cheshire-born, he began supporting City when he first went to
Leicester in 1973 to work for a local museum.
He said yesterday: ''Despite City's poor fortunes, I'll be back next
season.''

THREE schoolgirls chased a masked man they spotted running from their
local bank.
James Innes tried to hide in a nearby caravan park but they kept
watch, then chased him again until he entered woods. They were able to
put police on the trail of Innes, who was jailed for five years at the
High Court in Inverness yesterday.
Innes, 23, of MacDonald Crescent, Burghead, admitted assaulting local
bank staff Mrs Merlys King and Ms Nicola Henderson while armed with a
piece of metal tubing and wearing a mask, lunging at the pair while
brandishing and threatening them with the tubing, hitting Mrs King with
it, demanding they hand over a briefcase, and robbing them of the
briefcase and papers.
The two women were opening up the bank when Innes suddenly appeared
wearing a white plastic mask. He demanded money and during a brief
scuffle struck Mrs King on the head then picked up a briefcase and fled.
He was spotted by the three girls.
One of them, Kirsty McGillivray, 13, of Firth View, Burghead, near
Elgin, said: ''I wasn't scared at the time though I was a bit nervous
later when I thought about it.''
Kirsty, who gave chase with friends, Katherine More, 14, of Macdonald
Crescent, and Kerry McIntosh, 13, of Forteath Street, both Burghead,
said: ''He ran out of the bank and was holding a bag and had a mask
covering most of his face. Katherine jumped out and he tripped but kept
running so we started chasing. Kerry chased about half the way then
stopped to try and get police.
''I went as far as the edge of the wood then thought I'd better stop
there because it could be dangerous. We didn't feel brave when we did it
but a lot of people said afterwards that we had been.''
Advocate-depute Bill Totten said yesterday: ''I would like to take
this opportunity to commend their behaviour and how they approached
this. They immediately realised they were witnessing the aftermath of a
robbery.''
Police began a search using tracker dogs and found the stolen
briefcase and the white mask.
Unemployed Innes denied any involvement but when the mask was later
examined his fingerprints were discovered and he admitted the robbery.

IF you had to name the most mythologised man in Britain today, John
Birt would surely feature on the shortlist. Little of the mythology is
complimentary.
The BBC has never been averse to turning the news spotlight on itself.
After all, it's one of the few forms of advertising it can indulge in
and it's cheap. Today, yet again, the corporation's cropped-haired,
Armani-suited Director-General is in the hotseat. Few can doubt that
Birt himself made the decision to go ahead with screening the John Major
Panorama interview, in full knowledge that to do so three days before
the Scottish local government elections would raise political hackles
north of the Border.
The suggestion by Andrew Hardie QC that the BBC might have been
unaware of the imminence of the Scottish elections can't be taken
seriously in view of the leaking of the internal memo, revealing that
the Panorama team was expecting flak for screening the interview. In
these circumstances, and with recent attacks by Jonathan Aitken and
company still simmering on the back burner, it is inconceivable that the
decision to go ahead wasn't made at the highest level.
Birt has pulled the plug on Panorama before: once over the Spycatcher
allegations and again last year over the Westminster Council council
house sales for votes scandal. On this latter occasion, the reason was
the imminence of English and Welsh local elections and the fear that it
could contradict the corporation's strict undertakings to provide
balanced coverage in the run up to polling day. So what's so different
this time?
Yesterday one highly placed insider said: ''I think there's a
perception in Scotland that the BBC are up to something but I don't
believe there's any hidden agenda.'' However, not surprisingly, the
assertion that the Westminster programme dealt with a local issue and
the Major interview concerned purely national and international ones,
has cut little ice in Scotland. When were local elections decided purely
on local issues anyway?
In the absence of straight answers to straight questions, it is
predictable that certain conspiracy theories seem to be taking root and
seem destined to graft themselves on to the complex and controversial
reputation of John Birt. Among those questions are two in particular:
would the BBC have dared to screen a 40-minute interview with the Prime
Minister three days before the English local elections, without offering
the opposition leaders equivalent air time? Second, who decided when the
interview was to go out? Could it have been Downing Street or
Conservative Central Office and, if this is the case, did they make the
date of transmission a condition of agreeing to the interview?
It is no secret that Birt is obsessed with the BBC's reputation for
impartiality. Is it possible that in the wake of the Aitken controversy,
Birt wanted to show the interview to soothe ruffled feathers at No 10?
Even those closest to John Birt don't claim to know what goes on
behind that broad, menacing smile. ''He's very logical in his thought
processes. He thinks things through and carries them forward very
carefully. He's a rather shy man. I think that's why people think of him
as austere and remote. In small groups he can be quite warm and
friendly,'' said one.
This is not a side of Birt that's much talked about. Instead, there
are a number of legendary tales about his fanaticism and apparent lack
of human warmth. Within the corporation he is famed for his
post-Christmas diets, which consist of picking a target and weight and
fasting till he reaches it, even if that means sipping mineral water
while lunch guests self-consciously get working on platefuls of steak
and chips.
He has a passion for statistics, particularly about the weather. At a
weekend brainstorming session for senior staff shortly after his arrival
at the BBC, he made everyone in the room stand up and tell a joke.
Without smiling, Birt gave each a score for content and presentation.
As Birt took the knife to what he saw as the extravagent excesses of
the BBC, cutting thousands from the payroll and ruthlessly centralising
formerly ramshackle structures, most survivors were content to huddle
together for security and mutter behind his back. One of the few to
brave the parapet was the veteran India correspondent, Mark Tully. He
declared that the BBC was on the brink of becoming an Orwellian
creation, run by fear and staffed by sycophants. In a characteristically
muscular repost, Birt replied that the old BBC was more like a cross
between the Kremlin and a Byzantine court.
Two years ago the late Dennis Potter brought tears of delight to
Birt's critics when he famously described Birt and Marmaduke Hussey,
chairman of the BBC governors, as a pair of ''croak-voiced daleks,'' in
the context of a brilliant critique of the Birtian reforms. In
image-devastation terms, this must just about rank with Denis Healey's
crack about being savaged by a dead sheep.
But, cheap laughs aside, Birt has not lived up to the worst fears of
those who saw him as a Tory appointee, brought in to strip down the
corporation in preparation for a future in the commercial sector. Long
after the dalek jokes and the Armani suits and the row about his
personal tax arrangements have been forgotten, Birt will be remembered
as the man who saved the BBC Charter from the fate Margaret Thatcher had
planned for it. Supporters argue that reforms which made Birt bitterly
unpopular at the time have to be seen in the light of this fight for
survival. These include the merging of the warring factions of news and
current affairs into one department, the creation of a bi-media
directory to break down the barriers between radio and television, and
the introduction of producer choice, designed to bring market-style
commercialism to BBC departments.
For BBC Scotland, in spite of the promises at last year's Newspaper
Press Fund Lunch about devolving decision-making and a bright future for
programme-making in Scotland, there has been a pretty undiluted diet of
bad news: more job losses, two departments closed, and the loss of the
outside broadcasting unit. The latest row will serve only to increase
Birt's villification in Queen Margaret Drive.
But as one battle-scarred BBC executive commented yesterday: ''Birt
has weathered far worse difficulties than this. He's a born survivor.''

<TEXT>
SHETLAND council's chief executive, Mr Malcolm Green, emerged
unscathed after a challenge over auditors' criticisms of the council's
accounts fizzled out yesterday.
During an acrimonious debate about the report on the accounts for
1992/93, no councillor mentioned Mr Green by name and no-one asked about
estimated losses of at least #140,000 which resulted from financial
blunders identified by auditors Ernst &amp; Young.
Mr Green was finance director until promoted to chief executive in
1991.
Convener Lewis Smith promised a special meeting soon to answer
questions about the accounts for 1992/93 and the subsequent year.
Finance director Andrew Matthews warned that the auditors had ''very
similar'' criticisms of the 1993/94 accounts.
Councillors agreed to ''note' the auditors' report, which said
accounts were late, inaccurate and not presented in line with
professional codes of conduct.
The report said that more than #1m of VAT was not reclaimed on time;
bills for more than #209,000 were sent out late; a botched refuse
collection contract cost an extra #850,000 over five years; the council
broke the law by not putting some contracts out to tender; and its
officials wrongly assumed that #4.3m of capital programmes, funded by
the council's oil revenues, did not have to be counted in Government
spending permission.
Councillor Tavish Scott said the auditors' criticisms were ''very
clear and very damning''. He said the present finance director,
appointed in 1993, was ''trying to get things in order from the mess
that his predecessors left him''.
Councillor Scott claimed that older councillors did not want questions
asked. ''I intend to continue asking these questions. We'd like to know
why this happened.''
Councillor Willie Tait said Councillor Scott appeared to be suggesting
that the previous council were ''a bunch of idiots or imbeciles''.
''It's ludicrous to make allegations like that at a public meeting, he
said.
Vice-convener Jim Smith said: ''Are we going to have a witch-hunt?
That would be bad for staff morale, which is low enough already.'' A
council meeting was ''the wrong place to start washing dirty linen''.
Councillor Brian Gregson said that, like Councillor Scott, he would
continue asking questions, not least about an increase of 464 staff
during 1992/93.
* Mr Green has apologised to a BBC Radio Shetland reporter after an
incident at Lerwick Town Hall on Tuesday of last week. He has also made
an official apology to the BBC.
According to council sources, Mr Green took exception to a question
about his feelings of personal responsibility after the auditors'
report. During a subsequent altercation, a BBC tape-recorder was
allegedly interfered with and Mr Green became ''physical'', sources
said.

POLICE believe the remains of a child found on the edge of a golf
course may be those of nine-year-old Daniel Handley, missing since
October.
The remains were discovered in a shallow grave on scrubland at the
Woodlands Golf Club at Bradley Stoke, to the north of Bristol.
Detectives were continuing to search the area yesterday.
Scotland Yard has confirmed that detectives investigating the
disappearance of Daniel near his home in Beckton, east London, were
liaising with Avon and Somerset Police.
Detective Superintendent John Newman, of Avon and Somerset, said
yesterday: ''We are treating this as a murder inquiry.''
Mr Newman added that forensic scientists were trying to establish the
age and sex of the child.
The cause of death is not yet known.
Although forensic evidence suggested the remains could have been there
for up to two years, the initial police investigation is being
concentrated over the past nine months.
Police launched a massive hunt for Daniel after he disappeared on
October 2. He was last seen leaving a friend's flat in Beckton to cycle
the short distance home. His bike was found abandoned nearby.
Police dredged a nearby lake, searched an old gasworks, and dug up the
garden of his mother, Mrs Maxine Handley, 34. They later arrested and
questioned Mrs Handley and her boyfriend, Mr Alex Joseph, 21.
Detectives feared Daniel, known to be a friendly boy, may have been
abducted. Witnesses said a child fitting his description was seen
talking to two men in a car.
His disappearance was reconstructed on BBC1's Crimewatch UK programme
and his mother made an emotional appeal for his return.

THE last remnant, the happy band who march into the ballot boxes to
support the Government tomorrow, will include myself. But still I
sometimes wonder what the past 16 years have been for. I wondered this
in particular after reading the parliamentary report on Scottish
Enterprise and its subordinate agencies which has just come out.
The Conservatives certainly had a problem with the apparatus of such
agencies inherited from the Labour Government in 1979. In Scotland,
economic development comes into the same category as motherhood and
apple pie: it is very hard to be against it or against the people
providing it for us. But the Scottish Development Agency especially had
been spending a great deal of the taxpayers' money to no great purpose,
making a lot of dud investments and showing a desperate tendency, rather
like Nick Leeson, to up the stakes in an effort to get results.
It still did not seem advisable just to abolish the SDA, because that
would have offered another example of the Tories being beastly to
Scotland -- though one wonders, at 11% in the polls, whether such
scruples have made much difference in the end.
On the other hand, it might have been possible to enliven deadbeat
socialist planning with the fizz of enterprise.
There was some fellow called Bill Hughes who had been to America and
seen how they did things there, in outfits called Private Industry
Councils. No-one had otherwise heard of these august bodies, or stopped
to ask what actual part they played, if any, in the successes of the US
economy. What the hell! Politicians needed an idea and Hughes had one.
The next thing we knew, Scottish Enterprise was with us.
There was one trouble with all this. America is certainly an
enterprise culture. Scotland is not, at least not in its official
ideology, though there are plenty of individual Scots who get on in
happy oblivion of what the state has in mind for them.
It is a typical Scottish fallacy to think that you can alter reality
by setting up an institution of the state. In this case, it was an even
more egregious fallacy to think that by the same means you could import
a desirable element of a foreign culture into ours. In fact, so far as I
can see, Scottish Enterprise has introduced nothing of American
enterprise. It has just nestled down very nicely into our own culture of
patronage and subsidy.
One frequent by-product of it is corruption. It was the rapid
emergence of cases of corruption, particularly in the subsidiaries, the
Local Enterprise Councils, that helped to prompt this parliamentary
investigation. No doubt stronger and more public monitoring can damp
down plain malpractice.
But perhaps we should be more worried about the definition of
enterprise that these councils and their parent organisation are
creating in Scotland.
I thought the Scottish Affairs Committee was amazingly generous
overall in its report but, while it did make some overt criticisms, a
good deal more can be read between the lines. There is the obvious point
that the LECs' boards are dominated by self-selected and
self-perpetuating groups of local businessmen, who have been able to
hide practically everything they do under the fig leaf of commercial
confidence.
I dare say that these directors are in many instances people of
outstanding public spirit dedicated only to the good of the community
without thought of material reward for themselves. I do ask myself how,
in that case, they have ever got on in business. And then I ask if we
can be sure that 100% of these directors really are people of
outstanding public spirit, etc. If not, it only needs one to start the
rot. Corruption is, after all, spread by networks, and institutionalised
old pals' clubs are an invitation to it.
It is not that they have much else to do. As the report makes clear,
the greater part of the LECs' functions is just to carry out policies
laid down by the Government, which they cannot alter. For the rest,
contracts are put out to consultants, a fast-growing breed of well-fed
men whose main expertise seems to lie in, as the report candidly puts
it, ''cosy relationships''. The ample time left over appears to be
devoted to the pushing of pens and passing of paper created by the
existence of the LECs themselves.
But the basic question is whether Scottish Enterprise and all its
works have made any difference. I judge that they have not from its own
ludicrous claims to the contrary. It is ''willing to put its name'', in
its own ambiguous phrase, to the creation of 40,000 jobs in each year
since its creation. That means 200,000 jobs in all. But if we look back
to the boom decade of the 1980s we find that no more than 100,000 net
new jobs were created in Scotland. The claim therefore is that, in half
that length of time, a period also of recession, Scottish Enterprise by
its own efforts alone gave us twice as many jobs as the whole economy of
Scotland had been able to generate in the greatest sustained expansion
of the twentieth century. There must be a terminological inexactitude in
there somewhere.
Still, I am sure Scottish Enterprise faces a rosy future. In most
respects, parliamentary investigation has let it off the hook. If Labour
comes back to power, it can expect a fresh lease of life. It may have to
admit a few more members into the old pals' clubs, people pleasing to
the new masters. But there is bound to be much more money to waste, and
meaningless statistics that look good will be still more welcome than
before. To bequeath all this as a Conservative legacy shows, I think,
what has gone wrong in Scotland during the past 16 years.

BOTANIST Ian Darwin Edwards produced an array of blowpipes and
poisoned arrows at a science festival lecture in Edinburgh yesterday --
to illustrate how modern medicine has benefited from primitive hunting.
Demonstrating how poisons derived from a variety of plants are now in
common use, he added: ''Let us not forget that people are still using
plants today. It is very important to preserve the rain forests and the
culture of the people who live in them.
''Who knows what else there is to offer.''
Speaking at the Royal Botanic Garden, where he is lecturer in
education, Dr Edwards explained how poisons used on arrow tips
throughout central Africa, Borneo and South America, had provided a
number of benefits to medicine and modern science. They included
cortisone, belladona, strychnine and morphine.
In particular, Cameroon in West Africa, was one of the richest areas
of plant chemicals in the world, capable of producing a vast range of
plants of special use in cardiac surgery and research.
Dr Edwards said it was also significant that plant research had
created a revolution in medicine, leading to the birth control pill.

SCOTTISH judges, so often criticised for being out of touch, must be
pleasantly surprised at the compliments being paid to them for pulling
the plug on the Prime Minister's interview on Panorama.
Politicians, other than Conservatives of course, have been queuing up
to pat them on the back for restating the independence of the Scottish
judicial system and for protecting the fairness of tomorrow's local
government elections from southern interference.
That may well be the effect of the decisions taken by the judges,
although their lordships will be careful to sidestep any attempt to
embroil them in political controversy.
The ruling by Lord Abernethy, backed by Lord President Hope, Lord
Murray, and Lord McCluskey, that the BBC was arguably in breach of its
obligation to treat controversial topics fairly, was taken on strictly
legal grounds.
What is certainly true is that it has alerted some of the great and
good in London to the fact that elections are taking place in Scotland
tomorrow, that we regard them as important and that we have a separate
legal system with some independently minded judges.
The attempt by the BBC to go to London to overrule the decision of
three Court of Session judges over the Panorama ban has also highlighted
the role of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords as the court
of last resort in Scottish civil cases.
It is a system that has existed since the Act of Union and the legal
profession in Scotland is divided over its continuing usefulness.
Some regard it as an insult that vitally important legal decisions
which affect people's lives are taken outwith our own boundaries by
judges trained in a different legal system.
Others, including the critics of the Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal
(from which there is no appeal to the Lords), consider that the
influence of fresh thinking from outwith our own narrow perspective is
no bad thing.
Before 1707 there was an appeal from the Scottish courts to the old
Scottish Parliament and although the Parliament did not survive, the
appeal procedure did.
A dozen cases or so find their way every year from the Court of
Session to five House of Lords judges. Normally this will happen only
after lengthy and extensive hearings by one Scottish judge, then three
on appeal, on some important point of law.
There are a number of reasons why the Lords might still have the final
say in the BBC case. The Court of Session judges refused the corporation
leave to go to the Lords because the case is still at a rudimentary
stage and there is no final decision on which to base an appeal.
The BBC may lodge a further appeal against the ban or it may raise an
action of declarator asking the Court of Session to state the law. More
likely, it will contest the petition for judicial review lodged at the
court by the Scottish National Party.
If the case does finally wend its way to the House of Lords by any of
these avenues there is no guarantee that it would come to the same
conclusion as the Court of Session. In recent times the Lords have
overturned Court of Session rulings in several important cases.
It is because of a Lords ruling, for example, that judicial review
cases must be heard at the Court of Session rather than the sheriff
court.
Last month, the law lords allowed an appeal by Grampian region against
the decision of two Court of Session judges (Lord McCluskey dissented)
over the access or custody rights of a parent whose child had been freed
for adoption.
That case was unusual because three of the five judges in the Lords
were Scots -- the Lord Chancellor, Lord Keith, and Lord Jauncey.
Normally, the Scots are in the minority and sometimes only one sits
with four English colleagues who may not know too much about Scots law.
One advocate who was in the Lords recently arguing a conveyancing case
was somewhat stunned to hear one of his lordships ask: ''What is a
missive?''
''It's enough to turn you into a nationalist -- if you weren't one
already,'' added the Scots lawyer.
Professor Robert Black, Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh
University, acknowledges the drawback to the system but points out that
at least it has improved since the days when none of the Lords judges
knew any Scots law and cared even less.
''At one time the Lords didn't give a stuff about Scots law and
regarded their role as making it as near English law as they could,'' he
said. ''There was also a time when Scottish counsel bowed out after the
Court of Session stage with that the result that neither counsel nor the
judges had a clue about what was going on.
''Some would see it as crazy that we have a final appeal court where
Scottish judges are in the minority. What could be done instead is to
convene a larger court in Scotland, consisting of five or seven judges.
''In that situation, the counsel and judges dealing with the issue
would be trained in Scots law. At the moment, the four English judges
often decide to 'leave it to the Jock'.''
As Scottish judges have long had to recognise, however, the House of
Lords is legally supreme, whatever its shortcomings in reality.
About 60 years ago, with perhaps just a hint of sarcasm, Scottish
judge Lord Sands described the Lords as ''an infallible interpreter of
the law.
''The House of Lords has a perfect legal mind. Learned lords may come
and go, but the House of Lords never makes a mistake. Occasionally, two
decisions of the House of Lords may seem inconsistent. But that is only
a seeming. It is our frail vision that is at fault.''

A LABOUR back bencher's bid to ban boxing was defeated in the Commons
yesterday, to cheers from both sides.
Mr James Callaghan (Heywood and Middleton) had pleaded: ''I urge this
House to take action to save the health and lives of boxers by calling
for a ban on boxing.''
However, Tory Harry Greenway (Ealing North) spoke in defence of the
sport, and MPs voted by 120 votes to 60, a majority of 60, not to give
Mr Callaghan's proposed Boxing Bill a first reading.
The latest controversy to bring calls for a ban centred on American
Gerald McClellan and his bruising encounter earlier this year with
Britain's Nigel Benn.
The boxer survived to return to the United States, Mr Callaghan said.
The MP wished him well, but warned: ''I doubt he'll ever fight again.''
He believed there was no alternative but to ban boxing ''before
further calamities occur in the ring.''
Mr Greenway, a former deputy headteacher, warned that a ban would
drive boxing underground, with bare-knuckle fights and no medical
supervision.
Boys enjoyed the sport, and learned purpose and discipline from it.
He said Paymaster General David Heathcoat-Amory was a boxing Blue, and
Labour sports spokesman Tom Pendry and Tory MP Sebastian Coe, the former
athlete, were both on the BBBC.
''Boxing is a well-supervised sport, it is a fine sport, it's one this
House would do ill even to contemplate abolishing,'' he said.

YOU don't know who you're dealing with, chum, so watch it. Perhaps you
believed this morning's Diary was just another erratic compendium of
furfuraceous trivia slung together by a hand-to-mouth scribbler whose
paragraphs could stand some rearranging? Wrong. Today's bestiary is in
fact brought to a lucky world by a member of an elite corps of top
managers and business achievers, someone with so many leadership skills
he should be running his own nation state.
Don't take our word for it: ask the Harvard Business Review.
One of these days we intend to persuade Shields to institute a prize
for the best junk mail of the week, if only because, with our letter
from the HBR in hand, we already have the contest in the bag. To say
that we did not recognise ourselves in its epistle is saying the least
of it.
''Dear Mr Bell,'' it begins, ''Your career isn't about money, is it?''
(That may be our editor's belief, but it is not one we share.)
''I didn't think so,'' writes John Mace, HBR circulation manager.
''It's about something deeper. Something so central to your core, to
what makes you tick, that you can't imagine living without it.''
At this point we guess the HBR is offering free hair-weaving, but no:
''It's about leadership. Having your say. Making things happen. Putting
your stamp on the future.''
(Sounds good to us. Better than punctuation, at any rate).
''Only an elite corp (sic) of top managers get a chance to subscribe
to the Harvard Business Review. With this letter, I am pleased to extend
the invitation to you, along with a valuable free gift.''
So pleased is Mr Mace, in fact, that he is willing to let us have a
year's supply of the HBR -- that's six whole issues -- for only $145
dollars.
Do we not feel lucky, punks? After all, past issues have included such
prose poems as ''How Nike designs emotion into its shoes'', and the free
gift is beyond compare. Think of it: our very own copy of Business
Classics: Fifteen Key Concepts for Managerial Success.
As majority shareholder, chairman, chief executive officer, and teaboy
of Bell Global Media and Pencil Sharpening plc, we can only wonder
what's taken the HBR so long. Mr Mace (still with us) writes,
inimitably: ''HBR is international. Hands-on. Research-oriented. It's
dedicated to honing your leadership skills. It helps you motivate people
to give their best. It gives you the tools to map company strategies.
Set agendas.''
Suddenly we feel like invading Poland. But here's a thought: are we
being given a glimpse of the future, one in which our own hard-pressed
universities, pared to the bone and driven to excesses of
''efficiency'', will be competing with double-glazing salesmen,
commemorative VE-Day tin helmet dealers, and the Reader's Digest?
Suddenly, the inevitable evening cold call from CR Smith, complete with
the offer of a ''free quotation'' (''Business is other people's money''
-- James Gillray), doesn't seem so bad after all.
Double and bust
WITH Mr Peter Baring having quit the erstwhile family firm, we were
reminded this week of the old definition of merchant bankers: people
paid twice as much as they would ever consider lending to themselves.
Fatal ambush
IT ISN'T likely that STV's Kirsty will feel the need to compete, but
we can report that American television is celebrating its first talk
show homicide. The really good news, according to the Hollywood
Reporter, is that advertisers are not expected to abandon The Jenny
Jones Show as a result.
It seems one Jonathan Nimitz did away with one Scott Amedure earlier
this month shortly after the pair had appeared together on air. Jonathan
was lured on to the show after being told he had a ''secret admirer'',
whom he assumed to be a woman. So ''humiliated'' was he to discover that
his fan was actually a man, he did what any normal American would do:
bought a 12-bore shotgun and killed Amedure.
The Reporter adds, less than helpfully: ''The story has prompted
soul-searching over the ethics of talk shows that depend on ambush
tactics.''
Blowing strong
MUCH amiable nonsense has been talked in some parts lately about poor
old Bob Dylan and how, at 53, His Bobness may be somewhat past it. Quite
the reverse is true, of course, and just to prove he's still at the
cutting edge old Zim has just marketed his very own CD-ROM.
Bob Dylan: Highway 61 Interactive has sold 45,000 copies in its first
month, despite the fact that it contains every lyric from each of his 41
albums and the essential information that 130 cover versions now exist
of Blowing in the Wind.
Naturally, Bob is applying himself to the requirements of marketing
the thing with his usual zeal. Speaking of the interactive age, he told
Newsweek recently: ''I know people who've got that on-line thing and
games and things, but I find it too inhibiting to sit in front of a
screen.'' Rush now, in other words, while stocks last.
Off the wall
STILL with music, of sorts. The Press Trust of India reports that a
farmer in the southern state of Karnataka, troubled by wild pigs
attacking his crops, has found ''to his surprise'' (though not ours)
that playing Michael Jackson songs scares them away.
Anath Patwardhan, who used to beat drums to keep the beasts at bay,
accidentally played a Jackson cassette on his small player while
guarding his field and found it caused the pigs to scarper. According to
PTI, he now plays Michael's tapes regularly. Experiments with Wet Wet
Wet tracks are proceeding.
Turning a blind eye
OUR informant swears this tale is true, but if it isn't it should be.
A man arrested for being drunk because police said he had a ''glazed
expression'' was freed recently after a court in Barrow, Cumbria, heard
he had a glass eye.
All things . . .
WITH Panorama's little local difficulty in mind, and the thrill of
tomorrow's local elections in prospect, we somehow feel compelled to
remind you that the best anagram thus far devised for Tony Blair is Tory
an' Lib.
Just thought we'd mention it.

THE General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is to be urged to
oppose the shunning of people with genetic defects.
The Assembly is being asked by its Board of Social Responsibility to
identify genetic stereotyping and stigmatisation ''as a real threat and
actual moral evil, similar to racism and apartheid''.
The board, in a report on human genetics published yesterday, says it
sees stigmatisation -- ostracising individuals or groups for not meeting
a genetic norm -- as the biggest threat from genome research.
The Rev Dr Will Storrar, convener of the working party which produced
the document, said in Edinburgh: ''We do not draw a line in the sand, as
some people might expect the Church to do, and say human genetics can go
thus far and no further.''
However, human beings created in God's image were not there to be
manipulated, and therefore they opposed any use of genetic screening,
therapy or information for this purpose.
The report said that there must be a concern that pressure will be
brought to bear on parents not to have children who are diagnosed before
birth as suffering from disability.
Parents might decide not to terminate a pregnancy, and this may be
contrary to the advice of professionals who might feel pressurised by
NHS financial restraints. The parents might feel isolated at having a
child who is regarded by others as ''a burden on society''.
The report, calling for these parents to receive support, says: ''Such
stigmatisation is anathema to Christian people.''
It says that any question of genetic testing before marriage to check
out the existence of abnormalities would have to be resisted. It could
change the whole fabric of relationships, with people perhaps becoming
willing only to enter into marriage with people free from certain
disease genes.
But a different situation would arise when one partner withheld
genetic information before marriage, which would constitute deception.
Meanwhile, the Free Presbyterian Church has turned its wrath on
churchmen who speak up for homosexuals.
The monthly magazine of the ''Wee Wee Frees'', edited by the Rev John
MacLeod, of Stornoway, describes the Church of Scotland as ''no church
of Christ but a synagogue of Satan'' for welcoming men and women whose
behaviour God has pronounced abhorrent.
In a discussion document, the Kirk declared: ''Many committed gay and
lesbian Christians do not see their disposition as evil.''

A SEXUAL revolution is urgently needed to lower Scotland's high rate
of teenage pregnancy, a Dutch expert warned yesterday.
Scots, he said, should adopt a more relaxed attitude towards sexuality
and lose their puritanical ''hang-ups'' about the issue.
The claim was made by Dr Evert Ketting, deputy director of the
Netherlands Institute of Social Sexological Research in Utrecht.
Dr Ketting, who has carried out extensive research into teenage
pregnancy, was speaking at a two-day international conference on women's
health in Aberdeen.
He said the pregnancy rate in the Netherlands for girls aged 15-19 is
currently 10 per 1000 -- despite an age of consent of 12.
But he claimed that in Scotland, where the age of consent is 16, the
rate is almost seven times as high -- 67-68 per 1000.
''There are a number of reasons why teenage pregnancies here are so
high,'' said Dr Ketting.
''The most important is a cultural one -- you have never really come
to grips with sexuality.
''It is something that is brushed under the carpet, forgotten about.
And I think there is some truth in the forbidden fruit theory.''
He explained that it was silly to expect youngsters to act responsibly
while they were being told not to have sex.
Dr Ketting claimed another reason for high teenage pregnancy rates was
the erosion of the safety net provided by the welfare state in Britain
since 1980.
He said pregnancy rates fell during the 1970s but started to climb
again shortly after the Conservatives regained power.
''Many young girls in Britain get themselves pregnant as an act of
despair,'' he said.
''A girl who sees that as the best future option in her life -- to
become a mother at 16 -- must have a terrible future outlook.
''We hardly find similar cases in Holland, where the welfare state is
much more accommodating.''
The conference, organised by the Aberdeen University, is being held to
celebrate 200 years of obstetric epidemiology in the city.
A spokeswoman for Grampian Health Promotions said Dr Ketting's
arguments were growing rapidly out of date.
''We are definitely changing. We have done away completely with the
old plumbing approach to sex education,'' she said.
''What is being taught in schools now is more open, more relaxed and
generally much less puritanical than it used to be.
''Obviously it will take time for such new initiatives to show up in
the figures, but we are gradually catching up with other European
countries.''

<TEXT>
FOLLOWING the deaths of nine new-born babies, a paeidatric team at the
Bristol Royal Infirmary has abandoned a high-risk technique to correct
defective heart valves, it was disclosed yesterday.
The open-heart ''switch'' surgery was used in the cases of 13 babies,
up to four weeks old, to correct pulmonary and aortic arteries which
were the wrong way around.
Although pioneered in America ten years ago, it was new to the
hospital, where it was carried out in the 18 months up to October 1993.
Team members expressed concern over the technique and it was decided to
discontinue it for the new-born while a review was undertaken.
The team, including two surgeons, continued with its general work in
the unit, which handles 120 to 150 open-heart cases a year.
That work included ''switch'' operations on older babies. But in
January this year, an 18-month-old baby died in an operation and a team
member again expressed fears over the technique.
Senior Department of Health officials were informed, and Dr John
Roylance, chief executive of the United Bristol Healthcare Hospital
Trust, ordered a detailed independent inquiry, which was carried out by
a paediatric surgeon and a cardiologist.
They supported moves, already undertaken by the hospital, to appoint a
paediatric surgeon specialising in the ''switch'' technique, and to move
children's operations from the mainstream infirmary to the nearby
Bristol Children's Hospital.
New-born children's ''switch'' operations will start at the children's
hospital later this year, when new facilities -- including a new theatre
-- will be in place.
Mr Ash Pawade, assistant director of the Melbourne Paediatric Unit --
an acknowledged world centre -- has been appointed to work with one of
the paediatric team surgeons.

THIS is what the tea leaves show: the dollar has been devalued by 13%
this year, the city of Washington is bankrupt, the medical insurance
service for pensioners will collapse in 2002, the trade deficit is
rising spectacularly, the new Republican majority in Congress has
decided that cutting taxes for the rich is its top priority but still
promises that it will balance the budget by 2002, most states intend to
allow citizens to carry concealed guns about their persons, immigration
continues faster than at any time in history, chiefly from Latin America
and Asia.
If there is any pattern in the tea leaves, it is that Americans are
happily oblivious to the trends of the times.
Their country's position in the world is rapidly diminishing, their
own standards of living are unlikely to rise over the next generation,
and Americans are likely to become more atomised, more distrustful of
each other, more resentful of government efforts to ameliorate the
national predicament.
Other cities have gone bankrupt before. New York itself teetered on
the brink in 1975. But this is the capital, and it has dug itself into a
spectacularly deep hole. Its budget deficit this year is around $750m
(the exact sum is a matter of dispute) which is about 22% of revenue.
On Monday the House of Representatives unanimously passed a Bill to
hand over the city's finances to a board appointed by the President.
This is all pretty humiliating for Washington, which is already
labouring under the burden of a mayor who served six months for
possessing drugs.
But the chief point is that Congress ducked the issue, handing the
problem over to a board that will not be constituted before the summer.
The city will run out of money next month.
Setting up a board is all very well -- but how will it find $750m?
This isn't just the case of one city, however important, mismanaging its
affairs. Other cities are heading down the same road, literally: the
underlying problem here is that people have moved to the suburbs, taking
their stores, jobs, and money with them. America's cities are sinking
all together, and there is no collective agreement on what can be done
about it.
Instead, Republicans blame the Democrats for the results of these
vast, impersonal economic forces, and propose more draconian anti-crime
measures and more prisons, and less welfare, as the solution. Democrats
just wring their hands -- and those suburbanites form themselves into
heavily-defended enclaves, and arm themselves against the dangers of the
surrounding darkness.
Meanwhile, the dollar continues its long decline. No doubt the reason
is that the trade gap is at an annual rate of $150bn, and rising.
American officials show not the slightest sign of knowing how to correct
this deficit, apart from abusing the Japanese.
What it means is that foreigners are beginning to doubt the wisdom of
accepting pieces of green paper in exchange for computers, cars, French
cheese and brandy, and all the other myriad items the Americans import
all the time. Adam Smith's rules apply, even to the United States of
America.
Now there are some good signs. American productivity has been rising
faster than most countries', including Japan's and Germany's.
Unfortunately, rising national income is concentrated in steadily fewer
hands, and is spent on imports.
What it all appears to mean is that America is changing rapidly. The
Republicans won the last election on a frankly reactionary platform.
They hate all this change and are now trying vigorously to reverse it.
Newt Gingrich is the contemporary King Canute.
He has ordered that girls stop having babies, that criminals mend
their ways, that the budget be balanced, family values restored,
America's place in the world reasserted, and, the most Canutish of all,
that immigrants stop pouring over the borders, changing the racial
make-up of the country and reinforcing the underclass of scarcely
educated and unemployable people living in the rotting inner cities.
Good luck to him. He is a historian, so ought to be able to take the
long view. In the mean time, he has to cope with the short-term. He has
promised to cut taxes and balance the budget by 2002, and to have us
well on the way by next year.
That's an election year, and his problem is that Republicans have been
winning elections since 1980 by promising that all these good things can
be achieved painlessly. They can't. So he has to choose whether to
inflict pain, and lose the election, or to swallow his words.
I can guess which he will do. He will choose not to inflict pain, and
to blame the President for failing to balance the budget. Then the
Republicans will win the 1996 election -- and inherit the whirlwind. The
Democrats can make a start looking for the next FDR.

INSTEAD of sucking life from anything that moves, like that
carnivorous cousin from New Zealand, our own eco-friendly worm is
digesting a diet of sewage sludge and colliery waste.
The groundbreaking worms are part of an innovative #1m reclamation
project at the former Hallside Steelworks, at Newton, near Cambuslang.
The derelict 80 acres are affected by heavy metal contamination and
finding worms with an appetite for waste has been the task of Bell
College of Technology in Hamilton.
Colliery waste from two adjacent pit bings will be mixed with dried
sewage sludge and spread over the area.
Then 60,000 lob worms will turn it into ''proper'' soil. It will then
be planted with 250 thousand fast-growing willows to act as a biological
filter.
Strathclyde Greenbelt, who lease the site from Scottish Enterprise,
plan to create a unique ''energy forest'', with trees that can be
cropped and sold, plus a community park.

AN Edinburgh University company which developed a revolutionary video
camera on a computer chip is due to arrive on the London Stock Exchange
next Tuesday, at a price which could reach #30m.
Vision Group plc, which already employs 45 people at its Corstorphine
plant, expects the flotation will raise #5m for further expansion of the
technology.
The concept of a camera on a chip was the brainchild of Professor
Peter Denyer, of the department of electrical engineering, and was
originally developed as a security device to scan fingerprints.
The university's technology transfer company, UnivEd Technologies,
backed the research with initial funding and support for its trading
company VLSI Vision.
Despite the research potential of Scottish universities, very few
products from the laboratory have progressed into actual products or
stock market listing.
UnivEd's managing director, Mr Mike Weber, said Vision would be the
first plc to come out of a university in Scotland. It illustrated how
invention could be translated from academia into commercial reality.
''The university is often regarded as an ivory tower structure, but
here it has been successful in introducing a product into the Scottish
market place, made by Scottish people, and which will perhaps be a major
Scottish company in the future,'' he said.
The university has a 6% direct stake in the firm valued at #2.3m, and
a further part-share of 8% held by a venture capital company.
The core product is a camera complete with lens on a chip, no bigger
than a postage stamp. It initially cost more than #63 to build, but bulk
production has brought unit costs down to #6 or less.
Applications include PC card sub-miniature cameras, which can be used
with portable computers, and an imputer capable of carrying out some
automatic functions like monitoring production lines and sounding a
warning if a fault arises.
The firm claims its technology supersedes bulky and existing equipment
and is both cheaper to buy and run. In the year ending July 1994, sales
were #1.1m, and the company reported a small loss. Sales in the
following six months rose to #800,000.
For Professor Denyer, 41, there has been a learning curve over the
last five years in developing the business skills for his current role
as managing director, but there are compensations. The flotation should
make him a millionaire.
''It has been extremely enjoyable to see something like this build and
grow, shortly to become a public company,'' he said.
''We have been investing heavily in the future applications of our
technology. The prospects for the company are extremely good.''
Professor Denyer said he expected the workforce to grow to 65 or 70
within a year. There were also substantial spin-offs for other firms,
since manufacturing was sub-contracted mainly to Scottish suppliers.
Vision is seeking to develop target markets in security and medical
fields. It also hopes to manufacture the first range of toys using the
technology by the end of the year, and work on automotive applications
with its principal minority shareholder, the Donnelly Corporation, a US
car mirror manufacturer.

<TEXT>
SUPERMARKET chain Safeway was last night accused of selling short a
Scots town by planning to close one of its stores.
The closure on May 13 will mean that 71 staff at the Hamilton town
centre shop could lose their jobs. It comes less than two years after
bosses said the store was not under threat.
Safeway executives said yesterday that they would try to ''redeploy''
workers or offer early retirement. However, compulsory redundancies are
expected.
Safeway's managing director, Mr Patrick Kieran, said: ''We are aware
this will be a disappointment to our staff and customers.'' But he added
the store was no longer viable.
The closure is part of a ''wide ranging'' company review. Of the
firm's 380 supermarkets in the UK, 17 are to close, threatening more
than 1000 jobs. The Hamilton store is the only one of 62 in Scotland
which will be axed.
Safeway opened a new store in Hamilton's Wellhall Road just over a
year ago. A local action committee opposed to the plan said it would
mean the closure of the town centre shop at Brandon Street.
However, store bosses said then that both stores could operate
successfully.
Local Liberal Democrat councillor, Mr Iain Blackstock, yesterday
condemned the decision to axe the Brandon Street facility.
He commented: ''I said this would happen at the time, but I was
assured the town centre shop would stay open.
''It is a very sad day for Hamilton and I am sure people will have to
think very carefully about what this company says in future.
''I am very angry that more than 70 workers could soon be on the
scrapheap. ''It also means a drop in revenue for the district council
because the rates at the out-of-town site are much less.''
He added: ''Many workers are part-time. I would like to know how they
will be offered early retirement.''
Safeway managing director, Mr Patrick Kieran, said: ''We are aware
this will be a disappointment to our staff and customers.'' But he added
the store was no longer viable.

BURGLARS raided the newly-built home of Chief Constable William Spence
on Saturday evening -- the day he took up his post as head of Tayside
Police.
Mr Spence's #150,000 home, in a village outside Dundee, was ransacked
while he and his wife were out. Thieves stole his leather police
identification badge, bearing his name and the Tayside constabulary
crest.
It is believed that a quantity of jewellery, a video recorder, and a
CD player, valued at more than #7000, were also taken after a patio door
to the rear of the house was forced.
Earlier in the day, Mr Spence, 51, who was formerly assistant chief
constable of Strathclyde, gave his first interview as head of Tayside
Police.
He said: ''We have set a target of reducing crimes against individuals
by 20%,'' adding that he ''appreciated people found break-ins a
frustrating and often frightening act of violation''.
Yesterday, Inspector Mark Watson of Tayside Police said: ''I can
confirm that there was a break-in at the home of the chief constable on
Saturday evening. The chief was not at home at the time.
''A number of personal possessions were taken, a police badge among
them. The matter is being investigated.''
Mr Watson declined to reveal whether or not Mr Spence had sought the
advice of Tayside's crime prevention unit, either before or after the
break-in.
He said: ''It would be inappropriate to discuss individual security
levels. But on this occasion, the security levels that were in place
were overcome.
''In the light of what has happened, a review of the existing security
levels is being undertaken.''
Mr Spence, a native of Aberdeenshire, is married with two daughters.
He is a Bachelor of Laws and was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in
1990.
He joined Tayside Police in 1988, as deputy chief constable. He has a
reputation as a strict disciplinarian, and is known for his tough
by-the-book methods.
In a statement last night, he said: ''In drawing attention to the
problems of crime recently, I did not anticipate that I would be able to
focus publicity on the subject again so soon, or with such impact.
''We are all dependent on the other people in society, and I hope that
the publicity generated by my misfortune on this occasion will help to
reduce the problems overall.''

''IN Scotland, the Prime Minister's words will be spoken by an
actor.'' Is this what we are coming to? I ask because in the past couple
of days we have seen the most nonsensical decision by a Scottish court
since they regularly turned down Paddy Meehan's appeals; political
correctness has run amok.
With a unanimous chorus of approval from the ''totally unbiased''
Scottish media, we have rejoiced in the success of the opposition
parties in banning the PM from our television screens. We have managed
to censor ourselves -- long live the Lord Chamberlain's office, the
D-Notice, and the gag!
Let me set out my stall. I am a Conservative, registered, unable to be
persuaded to desert, totally partial. But long before I was ever an
elected representative of the party I was, and still am, a working
journalist. And journalists are there to report the news.
The BBC accepted that fact; they knew that an interview with John
Major, whenever given, was news. What he had to say on international
events, the economy, even the current state of his party, was worth
broadcasting because people would be interested in what he had to say.
We Scots, however, were not permitted to hear, not allowed to make up
our minds about his message. If we heard him it might affect how we
voted tomorrow.
Instead, we saw the Holy Trinity of church elders, Jim Wallace, Jack
McConnell, and Mr Smug himself, Alex Salmond, go dashing off to the
court for assistance. Sadly, the judges granted their curb on free
speech. Incredibly, Scottish newspapers, including this one, thought
they were right.
Years ago, when I was first elected to Edinburgh Corporation, there
was a standing committee which vetted sexy films. At 10.30am, we used to
troop into the Ritz Cinema to watch nude women playing tennis.
There would be much ''ooo-ing and aahing' from the magistrates, a
discussion afterwards -- ''we couldn't possibly allow Edinburgh citizens
to see the bit where she took her pants down'' -- and then films such as
Fanny Hill and Lady Chatterley's Lover would be run out of town. You
could, however, see them in Musselburgh just a bus ride down the road.
Indeed cinema owners in other towns used to cash in on the ban. ''See
the picture Edinburgh councillors used to ban'', read the posters and
folk would flood in to do just that. Probably made them depraved.
One day, in the council, I moved that we stop all this nonsense,
accepted the certificates granted by the British Film Board, and let the
people decide what they would see and how they would spend their money.
I won.
Many years later, in this newspaper, I campaigned against the
television ban on Sinn Fein. It gave them an importance they did not
deserve, it made them appear glamorous, it made them martyrs.
Does anyone now, having heard the squeaky tones of Martin McGuinness
or the gloomy groans of Gerry Adams, regret that the regulations have
been changed? Now the republicans have to defend their position and
answer awkward questions. That is what democracy is really all about.
But the BBC has to be impartial, we are told, particularly in the
run-up to local elections. Since when? Who are the independent,
non-partisan broadcasters who rule the airwaves -- Colin Bell, Kenny
McIntyre, Ruth Wishart, me? There are more lefties in Queen Margaret
Drive than there are in Keir Hardie House.
But there is an important principle here, screams the Lab/Lib/SNP
alliance. Yes, there is. It is that the BBC should carry all the news
that is worthy of the name.
If it was up to me, no party, mine included, would have an automatic
right to party political broadcasts. They should be made to face up to
real interviews, just as they are in newspapers. No-one should have the
right to tell lies for 10 minutes.
Banning the Prime Minister's broadcasts has been one of the biggest
own goals of all time. Did the drop of the Scottish curtain actually
harm Mr Major? Quite the reverse, in my opinion.
His words were reported far more fully in every Scottish paper simply
because of the ban.
The opposition parties were forced to argue both ways at once. Of
course they could not admit the PM was capable of swaying a single vote,
it was just jolly important he was not given the opportunity.
This sad little episode has all the ingredients for a classic Scottish
whinge. The approval to show the programme was taken in London, it was
an interview with a Prime Minister we never elected, an evil plot to
influence us, a Tory trick.
If and when we get our own Parliament, if we even achieve
independence, we may experience difficulty in finding scapegoats for our
troubles. What we will never be short of is politicians ready to tell us
what to read, what we can see, whom we can hear.
I hope I am not alone in finding that utterly pathetic.

<HEADLINE>Islanders express relief as Keith Schellenberg departs for pastures new after #1.5m deal Former owner makes final break from Eigg</HEADLINE>

THE atmosphere in the Eigg community hall was one of both relief and
bitter resentment last night.
The former landlord, Mr Keith Schellenberg, had collected some his
furniture from the estate lodge and left the Hebridean island an hour
before. The annual jumble sale was now starting to get into full swing.
There was relief that he had gone -- and without the island's
treasured map. The controversial owner, who sold Eigg for a reputed
#1.5m, made it clear that he intended to remove the historic Ordnance
Survey map of the island which dates back to 1805.
The large hand-painted map was originally owned by the chief of the
Clanranald and is said to be extremely valuable. It details the layout
of crofting communities from almost 200 years ago. Locals, who have
already accused Mr Schellenberg of stripping assets from the island,
assert that it is part of Eigg's heritage. It has been passed from one
generation of landlord to the next since at least the start of this
century.
Almost the entire population of the island -- around 80 people -- met
on the pier yesterday afternoon. The nearby craft shop, where the map is
kept, was, by now, blocked by a battered yellow minibus with flat tyres.
As the rain drizzled on and off, all was set for a confrontation in
the shadow of the island's distinctive slender mountain An Sgurr. The
66-year-old former landlord made his way off the boat Spanish John and
walked through the crowd.
Postman John Cormack said: ''Schellenberg got a bit excited when he
discovered the shop was blocked by the old community bus. There was a
policeman there on other business and Schellenberg complained bitterly
about what he calls the lawless people of Eigg.
''He was annoyed and he got a bit of banter from the locals but he
kept a fixed grin on his face. We are just absolutely delighted to see
the back of him.''
Mr Schellenberg's ownership of Eigg has been surrounded by
controversy. He bought it for just #270,000 in 1976 saying he did not
want it to fall into the hands of the state.
He originally owned it jointly with his second wife, Ms Margaret
Williams, and bought it in his own right three years ago after their
divorce, although he lives for most of the year in Banffshire.
Relationships between laird and locals deteriorated over the years
because of disputes over his management style and uncertainty over their
security of tenure and leases.
Relations reached an all-time low last year when Mr Schellenberg's
vintage Rolls-Royce and 78-year-old fire engine were destroyed by fire
in what he believed was an arson attack.
He also accused locals of carrying out a conspiracy against him, and
has branded them as pot smokers and lacking in culture.
Last week's sale of the island to German artist Marlin Eckhard was
greeted with universal optimism in the community.
Back at the jumble sale yesterday -- organised to raise money to help
buy a compact disc player for the local school -- the talk had already
turned to the future.
Secretary of the Island of Eigg Trust, Dr Christopher Tiarks said:
''As far as I'm concerned Mr Schellenberg's stewardship of the last 20
years has come to an end and is now history. The future is the important
thing for the island. We are all prepared to work with the new owner for
the benefit of the island.''

FOOTBALLER Eric Cantona and his family are being forced to quit their
rented home.
The Manchester United player, his pregnant wife Isobelle, and their
young son have until later today to move out after negotiations broke
down for the club to buy the house at Boothstown in Salford, Greater
Manchester.
The Cantonas have lived in the #80,000 three-bedroomed house on a
quiet estate since last summer. Their son, Raphael, attends a local
school.
United had started negotiating to buy the house for the family after
they were served notice to quit by agents acting for the house's owner,
who is living abroad. However, when they failed to reach agreement by
the time the lease expired on Sunday, the Cantonas were given three days
to leave.
The Frenchman -- whose two-week jail sentence for an attack on a fan
was last week replaced by 120 hours community service by a Crown Court
judge -- is now expected to be moved to a secret address by the club.
United's general secretary, Mr Ken Merrett, said yesterday: ''We had
entered into negotiations over buying the property, but for obvious
reasons we wanted more time for the situation to clarify. There was also
a difference of opinion on the asking price.''
The club made what it considered a ''fair offer'' but its request for
a further month's rental was turned down.
Cantona, 28, met probation officers in Salford on Monday to discuss
his duties under the community service order, which are likely to
include coaching youngsters.

THE clearest indication yet that the Tories are bracing themselves for
dire council election results came yesterday when they switched from
talking about winning control of authorities to the likelihood of
influencing minority administrations.
The Scottish party chairman, Sir Michael Hirst, refused to set
specific targets, saying this would be playing ''the numbers game''.
However, he insisted the eventual influence of Conservative councillors
would be ''stronger than the crude numbers''.
He cited existing examples of councils which had delivered improved
services as a result of strong Tory groups, in spite of them not having
overall control, and said that, come Friday, Tory councillors would
function ''in the real world''.
''If we have no overall control, I don't expect our councillors to sit
in a corner and sulk,'' said Sir Michael, but added: ''As party chairman
I cannot do other than be concerned and at times depressed about our
continued low standing in the polls.''
He said the elections were about services and community charge levels,
adding: ''We have been at pains to point out this is not a referendum on
national politics. It is about a fresh start in local government.''
Both he and Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association president
David McLetchie accused opposition parties of conducting negative
campaigns which ignored local issues and concentrated on the
Government's mid-term difficulties.
Sir Michael conceded: ''Divisions in the parliamentary party and
elected members insulting a Prime Minister who is respected by Scots
have dismayed Conservative voters. The electorate is still recovering
from a very bad recession, still concerned by divisions in the
parliamentary party, and we are still on trial to some extent. But the
election is perhaps two years away and there is evidence on the doorstep
that people will give us a chance.''

JUST as buffalo gather at the watering hole at the same time every
day, BBC staff congregate at the BBC Club daily to discuss who has done
what to whom; who is on the way up; and who is on the way down.
Members of a miners' social club may be more physically vicious
towards each other when they disagree -- but in the BBC Club the weapons
are the rapier-like wit, rather than the rapier itself.
Only 200 yards from the BBC Scotland headquarters in Queen Margaret
Drive in Glasgow, the BBC Club is where the BBC staff can shed
inhibitions, and endlessly speculate on the company's future. To
outsiders it is incestuous, to the BBC staff it is a warm, cosy
atmosphere where people can relax among their ain folk.
Yesterday, there was only one main topic of conversation -- the
banning of the Panorama programme. Naturally, it was a sensitive
subject, that BBC staff were unwilling to be quoted upon. They develop
an automatic quick flip of the head. Ask them a question and they
automaticaly check who is behind them, and who may be overhearing them.
They then answer any question with the following introduction: ''This
did not come from me . . .'' or ''Don't quote me direct . . .'' Who can
blame them? There is hardly a company left these days that happily
allows its staff to be freely quoted in the public prints without some
comeback.
To generalise their views, most were saying yesterday that BBC London
was simply unaware that there were local elections in Scotland. Not that
people should get too upset about that. If we were truthful with
ourselves, we would admit that most people in Scotland were unaware of
Thursday's put-a-cross-in-a-box day.
They believed that John McCormack had alerted London to the problem,
but that London had simply ignored McCormack. Not that London, to be
fair, automatically ignored Scotland, but that London was more worried
about the viewing figures of its flagship current affairs programme
Panorama, than the political sensitivities of Scotland.
Panorama had seen its viewing figures slip against ITV opposition. It
needed big interviews to boost figures. John Major would supply the
viewing figures. It had taken a long time to track him down. They were
not simply going to give him up because of a little local difficulty in
Scotland.
So BBC Scotland was forced into the courts defending a position that
BBC Scotland was not in favour of in the first place. Staff were
obviously unhappy. The NUJ chapel held an emergency meeting and
expressed its anger at the arrogance of senior London management.
They saw it as just the latest example of the high-handedness of
London. They were worried that yet again the unique viewpoint of
Scotland was being ignored. Others wondered whether the Scottish
management were being forceful enough in fighting the Scottish corner.
There was little sympathy for John Birt. He is a man running the BBC
who is contemptuously dismissed by his staff. When the word spread
through the BBC Club yesterday that it had lost its attempt to appeal to
the House of Lords, someone shouted: ''That's John Birt getting his
wrist slapped again.''
And yet . . . although most people saw the row as indirectly
proclaiming the uniqueness of Scotland, and therefore almost all the BBC
staff were quite happy that the corporation lost the case in court,
there was a worry.
The worry is that the politicians won, and no matter how just the
cause, no broadcaster can be happy with the suggestion that politicians
can have a greater say on what can or what cannot go on screen before
the viewers.
Too much political interference is the road towards a banana republic
-- and surely that does not apply to Scotland.

I HAVE just drafted a note to send to John McCormick, Controller of
BBC Scotland. I'm offering myself for a 40-minute interview. I think
that Monday, May 29, would be a good day. It may be only three days
before the possible date for the Perth and Kinross by-election but why
should the other parties mind? After all I'll promise not to talk about
Perth and Kinross, but just about housing, the health service, taxation,
oil revenues, the constitution, and the highly successful SNP Tayside
region ''Warm up for Winter'' campaign.
In any case, the Tories had five minutes on Anne and Nick the other
day, so they've had their share. And my letter will, of course, remind
the BBC that I don't think they are biased.
But perhaps I won't send the letter, because I think it would get a
pretty dusty response from the BBC. The type of response that the
Panorama team should have given John Major when the Downing Street staff
offered him for interview three days before the Scottish local
elections.
On Newsnight on Monday, Tony Hall of the BBC was quite unable to
answer when pressed by the excellent Jeremy Paxman on why the BBC had
allowed the Prime Minister to dictate the timing of the broadcast.
Little wonder that it is impartial and free-spirited journalists like
Paxman who are such an anathema to the Birtist regime in Broadcasting
House.
Just as unconvincing was Hall's assurance that such an interview would
have been broadcast three days before an English poll -- an assurance he
was unable to back up with reference to any previous example or
precedent.
This week's events have so far centred on Panorama and its interview.
That was an important and flagrant example, but it is not the whole
issue. Most people in Scotland would rather watch paint dry than listen
to Major for 40 minutes and it is highly unlikely that even 40 Panorama
specials all devoted to the musings of Major could undo the damage that
he has done to his own party's electoral prospects in Scotland in the
past four years.
There are three big issues that lie behind the Panorama blunder by the
BBC. One is a UK concern, but the other two are specifically Scottish.
First, the Tories are clearly and deliberately creating a climate of
intimidation so that once the Cabinet bootboys have done their work, the
BBC will be only too happy to cuddle up to the Prime Minister in his
study, whenever he wants. No doubt those closest to John Major can see
in him many fine qualities, although these are totally invisible to the
rest of us. But certainly both his friends and his enemies can recognise
petulance when they see it, and he is the most petulant Prime Minister
of recent times. It is a pity that the BBC reacts so timidly to displays
of bad temper and foot stamping by Major and his cronies.
The second issue concerns BBC Scotland. Over the past few days it has
been hard to believe that there is such an organisation, at least at
management level. The BBC Governor for Scotland has been invisible, and
his Broadcasting Council reduced to complete insignificance. BBC
Scotland's management have acted as mere mouthpieces for decisions taken
elsewhere -- when, that is, they have been allowed to speak at all.
The delight of ordinary BBC Scotland staff at the bloody nose
inflicted on London by Scottish court action has been very obvious.
Those who work in the BBC in Scotland despair at the complete
subordination of Glasgow to London. They know the damage such
subordination has done to their organisation. Producer Choice, staff
cutbacks, and the savaging of programme-making ability have been imposed
without consultation and without any regard for the needs and
aspirations of those who serve the public in BBC Scotland or for the
paying public themselves.
The final issue is one of central importance to the only distinctively
Scottish political party and should be of interest to everyone concerned
with Scottish democracy. The matter of the ability or willingness of the
BBC in London to accommodate its responsibilities in current affairs
output to Scottish licence payers and Scottish viewers is a long-term
scandal but Panorama has thrust it back centre stage. In a country where
over 90% of news and current affairs is made elsewhere there must be
strategies put in place to ensure that the Scottish four-party system is
reflected to Scottish viewers and listeners. The occasional scrap thrown
from the groaning table of London-based news and current affairs is
offensive and anti-democratic.
No-one -- not even the Tories -- are making any complaints about the
scrupulous impartiality of BBC Scotland. But when the coverage comes
from furth of Scotland -- as it usually does on the BBC -- the Scottish
dimension is nearly always missing. Sometimes -- as in the European
elections last year -- a brave attempt is made to get it right. Often
the BBC fails wilfully and miserably.
That is why the action for judicial review started by the SNP on
Monday is of such importance. We cannot go to the courts every time the
BBC gets it wrong -- if we did we would have lawyers on permanent shift!
But we can take action that will, in the final resort, ask the Scottish
courts to rule on the legal obligations of the BBC and force the BBC to
honour their pledges.
When the Panorama team jumped to accept the offer of an interview from
John Major they had no ideas of the Pandora's Box they were opening in
Scotland. The BBC have lost more than a programme transmission -- they
have lost their reputation in Scotland, and undermined their Scottish
staff yet again.
And they have demonstrated all too clearly that Scottish broadcasting
is far from safe when left in the hands of the distant Birtists.

INDUSTRIAL relations problems, many involving pay disputes, have
worsened in Scotland, according to the Advisory Conciliation and
Arbitration Service (Acas).
Figures released yesterday show a big rise in requests for its help
last year. It dealt with 185 collective disputes and nearly 7000
individual disputes in Scotland.
The Acas annual report for 1994 records a 31% increase over the
previous year's figure in requests for conciliation.
As well as pay disputes there were also trade union recognition issues
in the public sector.
Last night Mr Bill Speirs, deputy general-secretary of the STUC, said
the significant rise in industrial relations problems indicated the
continued need for strong trade union organisation at the workplace.
Mr Mike Rowe, director of Acas in Scotland, said the taxpayers had
saved an estimated #700 for every case resolved without the need for a
formal hearing by an industrial tribunal.

THE BBC had no friends at Westminster yesterday, even among its own
employees. Director-General John Birt and his cumbersome,
London-centrist bureaucracy were being blamed for an episode which has
left the corporation looking inept and in danger of losing what little
political support it has among MPs.
Over at Millbank, the luxurious Westminster base for the BBC's army of
political journalists, the Court of Session's decision to refuse leave
to appeal was greeted with a barely muted cheer. Even the Beeb's
non-Scottish journalists have been taken aback by the magnitude of the
disaster.
MPs from all sides expressed astonishment at the stubbornness with
which Birt and his head of news and current affairs, Tony Hall, have
defended their interpretation of the BBC's strict guidelines on
impartiality. It was, one said, proof of how afraid they are of the
Government.
When Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken accused the ''Blair
Broadcasting Corporation'' of political bias 10 days ago, it was the
first in a concerted series of Cabinet attacks on its protagonists in
the media. The BBC struck back with a bout of intense navel-gazing, and
for days afterwards not a press conference at Westminster went by
without some BBC hack asking a politician to comment on the BBC's
commitment to impartiality. The nation's broadcaster felt it had been
the innocent victim of a political ambush.
Then came the fateful memo revealing Panorama's panic at the possible
implications for its plan to interview the Prime Minister three days
before the Scottish elections. The memo was Machiavellian. Written by
former Young Conservatives leader Nick Robinson and published last week,
it warned the BBC hierarchy to prepare a defence against the justifiable
criticism from opposition parties.
On Thursday John Birt was in Glasgow, where, sources claim, he was
confronted by the misgivings of his Scottish colleagues over the
Panorama interview. The implication, in the eyes of BBC staff, is clear:
management was warned, management knew, and management failed to do
anything to avoid an embarrassing disaster.
Yesterday both Downing Street and the BBC insisted that the choice of
a date for the interview was made jointly. There was no question of the
Government press machine imposing its wishes on the corporation. But an
interview with the Prime Minister takes some doing: as one Westminster
veteran pointed out, it happens only when the PM wants it to. The date
of the broadcast, however, was entirely up to the BBC.
Brian Wilson, Labour MP and journalist, sees in the co-operation
between the BBC and Downing Street -- Tony Hall led the negotiations --
yet more evidence of the corporation's traditional desire to keep the
Tories happy. ''They have made terrible fools of themselves and have
compounded it by continuing to defend the indefensible.
''It's very convenient that this should have happened so soon after
Jonathan Aitken's comments, since it reminds us of how much influence
Downing Street has exerted over the BBC in the run up to previous
elections. At the highest echelons they are very susceptible to pressure
from the Government.''
John Maxton, Scottish member of the Commons National Heritage Select
Committee, says the BBC has damaged its relations with its natural
friends in the Labour Party. ''I don't think they have kowtow'ed to the
Government, but it looks as if they have. It has weakened their
political position.
''The real supporters of the BBC are on our side of the Commons. We
firmly believe in public service broadcasting. Many Tory MPs don't. The
more they appear to be kow-towing to the Government the more they weaken
the support they have on our side and as a result they put themselves at
risk,'' he says.
Tory MPs have little sympathy for the BBC, although they --
predictably -- criticise the court's decision not to allow Panorama to
be shown in Scotland. Macclesfield MP Nicholas Winterton, chairman of
their All-Party Media Group, suggests it is time for the BBC's
guidelines to be reviewed.
Local elections are not General Elections, he says, and he would have
been happy for Mr Major's interview to be broadcast three days before
the English local elections next month. ''This is absolute nonsense. Are
we going to limit what the media says at certain times? To prevent a
national broadcast going out in a part of the UK because it is involved
in local elections does seem to me to be very strange.''
The power of television and the BBC's reliance on the licence fee make
it vulnerable to political criticism. Yet its day-to-day journalism is
widely admired at Westminster by all save the most thin-skinned
politicians. Its management, however, already loathed within the
corporation, is increasingly regarded as a clique of self-congratulating
toadies, who parrot John Birt's jargon of internal markets and producer
choice while remaining completely detached from the programme-makers who
understand the viewers and listeners they serve.
Yesterday the greatest fun to be had at Westminster was talking to BBC
employees. Most of what they had to say about the Panorama affair, and
in particular the role of Tony Hall, was unprintable. Few will offer
odds on Mr Hall's long-term prospects in his position. One source fumed:
''Are they naive or just stupid? Birt and Hall have ended up looking
ridiculous, and their contempt for politics and people beyond the M25 is
all too obvious. The gulf between the BBC in London and Scotland is
breathtaking.''
Those close to the Labour leadership took the same view. While
accepting that it was all down to no-one at the BBC noticing or caring
very much about elections in Scotland, John Birt's response has left
Tony Blair's office suspicious of the corporation's long-term motives.
But the quote of the day belonged to a BBC spokeswoman, who said: ''We
are not in a normal situation here.'' As one of her colleagues pointed
out, shame it has taken them three court appearances and an army of very
angry MPs to notice.

Education Correspondent BARCLAY McBAIN
believes the unitary councils will be severely tested over provision
of education
READERS of the unitary election runes surmise that district
councillors will secure two-thirds of the places on the shadow councils.
The existing district and regional councils will continue to deliver
services until March 31 next year, after which the new authorities will
come into their own.
One of the reasons for consigning those who win seats after Thursday's
vote to a year in the shadows is to prepare them for making policy in
areas they have no experience in, or knowledge of. If anecdotal evidence
is anything to go by some will require oxygen masks, such is the
gradient on the learning curve confronting them.
In one of the big single tier councils to be created by the break-up
of Strathclyde Region, district councillors are openly talking about
maintaining the district council structure and having one additional
committee to administer all the regional services.
Education alone accounts for half of all local government spending,
totalling about #2000m a year in Scotland. Even after the creation of
the unitary authorities, education will maintain the biggest budget.
Mrs Diana Daly, an executive board member of the Scottish Parent
Teacher Council, says: ''The very great concern we have is that the
majority of councillors who are elected are likely to have been district
councillors with no experience of education and a total ignorance of
what is required.''
Mrs Daly says ignorance has bred complacency.
''Many do not know the difference between devolved school management
and opting out. As a result we have had feedback from district
councillors saying they will not have much of the budget because it is
going direct to schools.
''A council committee is only as important as the amount of money
which can be disposed through it and if they believe the education
budget will be small they may not have an education committee. That
sends shivers down my spine.''
The councillors will be under no obligation to do so anyway because
the Local Government Etc (Scotland) Act repeals the statutory
requirement on councils to appoint a director of education and have an
education committee.
The Government argues that this will give councils greater flexibility
to respond to their needs, particularly in light of devolved school
management and contracting out. Critics, however, argue that appointing
an education director and having an education committee are essential to
ensure that the right decisions are made about spending at a time of
cut-backs in funding, and to guarantee accountability.
Under devolved school management, all headteachers by April next year
will be responsible for managing at least 80% of school budgets. Funding
will be channelled through the new councils, unless a school has opted
out of local authority control -- in which case it receives its funding
direct from the Scottish Office.
Strathclyde Region, which provides for 50% of Scotland's schooling,
has built budgets on the basis of need, with councillors and the
director of education, Mr Frank Pignatelli, arguing for resources to be
put into initiatives in line with the authority's social strategy. For
example, about #14m a year is spent on providing extra teachers in
deprived areas.
Such non-statutory functions will be at risk with the break-up of the
authority. Naive assumptions are being made about the bigger single-tier
councils being able to absorb the initiatives which Strathclyde has
introduced to give disadvantaged youngsters a better chance in life.
However, they will have more than enough problems to be going on with
as they seek to reconcile their education policies with the double
whammy of central Government funding cuts and the loss of a strategic
overview.
The latter point takes on greater significance if it is accepted that
Strathclyde was created to allow wealth to be redistributed -- and make
policy work -- within a powerful capital base. Strathclyde is, of
course, a political monolith, which makes it easier to push policies
through.
That base will just not be there in many unitary authorities so many
familiar issues will re-emerge with a sharper focus -- and not just in
Strathclyde.
School closures will rear their ugly head again. Surplus school places
are a problem in all authorities, but in Strathclyde, which at least
made a bold attempt to tackle the issue in the mid-1980s with its
Adapting to Change strategy, massive surpluses remain.
The most glaring example is Glasgow, with an occupancy rate of only
61% in the primary sector and 57% in secondary schools. At the other
extreme, a few popular schools -- such as Holyrood Secondary, Eastbank
Academy, and John Paul Academy -- are experiencing pressure on places.
There is therefore a clear case for a new rationalisation programme
across the city, but the new City of Glasgow council will find it
difficult to implement school closures which would be largely
concentrated on areas of deprivation. The case of St Gerard's Secondary
in Govan, which survived after parents used the opting-out legislation
to protect it, will not have been forgotten.
Across the country there are numerous contentious issues of
cross-boundary school attendance. In April 1996, pupils will suddenly
find themselves living in a different council area from the one in which
their present, or future, school is located. The new councils will have
to meet transport costs associated with cross-boundary arrangements, but
the real worry is whether pupils will be allocated places at all.
A new council administering a school which is popular and pretty full
may not see it as a priority to allocate places to youngsters living
outwith its boundaries.
Inter-authority transfers will mean one council invoicing its
neighbour for the ''cost'' of educating the neighbour's child. Mrs Daly
says this could lead to authorities getting together to redefine
catchment areas because they will be unhappy about having to ''pay'' for
the education of ''their'' children in another authority.
The Secretary of State will have the final say on any request to
change catchment areas but that may not be enough to soothe the
inevitable parental ire. Although the cross-boundary issue affects many
heavily subscribed schools in the secondary non-denominational sector --
such as Bearsden Academy, Carluke High, and Lenzie Academy in
Strathclyde -- it will be a particular problem in the Roman Catholic
sector, where the relatively small number of schools means a more
scattered distribution.
St Ninian's High in Eastwood, which at present has the deprived areas
of Arden and Darnley in South Glasgow within its catchment area, is a
classic example. Even in the primary sector, there are striking cases.
St Joseph's Primary in Helensburgh at present feeds into Our Lady and St
Patrick's High in Dumbarton. But Helensburgh has been put in the new
Argyll and Bute Council, which has no separate Catholic provision.
The uncertainty is of such concern to many parents of next year's
first year intake that more than 40% have not enrolled their children in
Our Lady and St Patrick's.
Mrs Elizabeth Maginnis, convener of Lothian region's education
committee, pointed out at a recent Catholic Education Commission meeting
that the new East Lothian council would not have a denominational
secondary in its boundaries.
She predicted that that would continue to be the case, and that the
council would be ''unlikely to want to educate its children in somebody
else's authority''.
Some of the new councils will be so restricted in size that they will
not be able to offer a full service in special educational needs.
A prime example is East Renfrewshire, which has only one such school
-- Isobel Mair School -- which caters for children with profound
learning difficulties. It is extremely unlikely the new council will be
able to extend its provision to cover those with mild and moderate
learning difficulties, and will therefore have to negotiate with
neighbouring councils to meet its obligations.
Indeed, this process of negotiation may have to be undertaken to
safeguard many aspects of existing provision. Non-statutory services
such as pre-five and community and outdoor education will have to be
taken forward in this way. Likewise, specialist services such as
educational development, quality assurance, and psychological services
-- which authorities provide on a centralised basis -- are vulnerable to
budgetary restrictions, and in some cases could disappear unless new
councils sit down together at an early stage and reach agreements on
joint provision, on a basis of shared financial and operational
responsibility.
Strathclyde intends to achieve full implementation of devolved school
management before the April 1996 deadline, but the problem will be
ensuring that its sophisticated computer support system is maintained by
the councils which succeed it. For many other authorities which are not
so far down the road, there will be genuine difficulty in introducing
DSM and local government reform at the same time.
Most authorities operate a social strategy which offers additional
support -- in areas such as teacher staffing and resource budgets -- to
schools in deprived areas.
Initiatives like supported study, under which pupils elect to remain
behind after school for additional work under teacher guidance, come
into the same category. The new councils which inherit social strategies
will undoubtedly be very supportive in principle, but against a
background of tight financial restrictions it is far from certain that
they can all continue to support them at existing levels.

<HEADLINE>Elephant kills Scots zoo keeper Gored to death because animal believed he was a rival bull</HEADLINE>

A SCOTS animal handler gored to death by a male elephant at a safari
park in Belgium was probably killed because the huge beast believed he
was a rival bull.
Zoo keeper Douglas Robertson, 37, from Stirling, was attacked on
Sunday as horrified tourists watched from their cars at the Savage World
Safari Park at Louveigne, near Liege.
Park manager Joseph Rensom said yesterday that Mr Robertson, known as
Toddy, was walking with elephants Ben and Kenya through the grounds --
as he had done almost daily for the last six years -- when 13-year-old
Ben suddenly knocked him to the ground.
''The animal stuck his head down, gave him a butt, caught him with one
of his tusks, trampled on his arm, and then stopped completely and just
stood there waiting for Toddy to get up and continue their walk. But
Toddy of course was severly injured.
''It took us a long time to get to Toddy because the elephants
wouldn't let us near him and had to be lured away with food. They were
guarding him because he was one off them.''
Mr Robertson was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where he
died of internal injuries five and a half hours later.
Mr Rensom said Mr Robertson had looked after Ben and Kenya since they
were six months old, following them from a zoo in Germany where they
were born to another German zoo as they grew older, and finally six
years ago following them to Louveigne.
''I think they considered Toddy to be one of them, and the male
elephant was just giving him a warning that he was the leader of the
group, and Toddy should be careful.
''It was just from one elephant to another . . .but Toddy was not an
elephant.''
Mr Robertson's father, retired catering manager, Mr Robert Roberson,
66, of Randolph Court, Stirling, said yesterday: ''He lived for his
elephants. They were the love of his life, and they seemed to love him
too.
''When they were sold to the safari park, Douglas stayed at the zoo in
Germany, but within 24 hours the park was on the phone.
''Ben had just backed into a corner, and wouldn't eat or do anything
for anyone else.''
Wildlife expert Dr Koen Brouwer of the Amsterdam-based European Zoo
and Aquaria Association said Mr Robertson had spent so much time with
Ben and Kenya that they would certainly have regarded him as their
dominant bull.
He said: ''Douglas was part of the herd. He was almost an elephant
himself. They were a herd of three. Ben was coming up to 14-years-old,
and I think he was challenging Douglas's authority as leader. He would
have been thinking 'I respect you, but I'm going to challenge you'.
''He wouldn't have been intending to kill Douglas, but of course the
human body cannot stand up to a challenge from an elephant.''
Mr Rensom said last night that Ben would not be put down, but the park
was consulting with the EZAA on new working practices.
He said: ''We are working with the world effort for conservation, so
why should we put down an elephant for something that was no fault of
the elephant whatsoever?
''We're trying to find a solution so the elephant is not put in this
sort of position again.''
He said no-one could foresee the accident.
''People used to say to Toddy 'Aren't you afraid?' He used to say 'My
elephants would never do me any harm'.''
Mr Robertson's first love was horses, but on leaving the old
Bannockburn Comprehensive he got a job as an animal warden at Blair
Drummond Safari Park in Perthshire.
The park mananger, Mrs Angela Rennick, said: ''He used to live in a
caravan here, and he was rather a quiet, loner type. But he was
completely and utterly obsessed with the animals. He used to spend all
his time with the elephants, even during the night.''
His uncle, Mr Toby Roberston, was in Belgium last night making
inquiries into his nephew's death. The family are hoping that the body
will be flown home on Friday.

SCOTTISH drivers are among the safest in Britain, a major new survey
by motoring experts revealed yesterday.
They are less likely to be in accidents than people in England and
Wales, the RAC report claims.
Although 62% of Scots have been in accidents while they were behind
the wheel it is still better than the 70% British average.
But the survey has puzzled RAC chiefs because Scotland has usually
come out worse in similar accident reports in the past.
RAC road safety chief Kevin Delaney said: ''It is the only aspect of
the survey which seems to contradict previous reports on accidents.''
What it shows is that Scotland has fewer drivers in accidents but
those who do crash do so on several occasions, bumping up the averages.
Only Northern Ireland beat Scotland for safety, in the UK survey of
more than 800 drivers, with a 61% rating.
Mr Delaney said: ''Northern Ireland is the most rural area in the
survey and sheer traffic levels are less.
''But both in Northern Ireland and Scotland the stress factor is
probably lower.
''People who have a 10-minute drive to work without any need to rush
are less likely to be in accidents than those who are trying to beat the
clock.
''Stress is a major cause of accidents and that is why local journeys
account for over 50% of accidents.''
Just 3% of crashes are on motorways, even though more than half of
motorists are most worried about crashing there.
Three in four accidents happen in areas where the speed limit in 40
mph or less.

SCOTLAND'S High Court judges may soon be logging on to a computer
before passing sentence.
But there is no risk of computers taking decision-making out of the
judiciary's hands, Lord Ross, the Lord Justice-Clerk, said yesterday.
Nearly two years of research by legal and computer experts at
Strathclyde University has resulted in a sentencing information system.
The Scottish Office, which funded the study, is considering using data
based on around 4500 sentences passed over a five-year period.
Professor Alan Paterson, head of the university's law school, said:
''If the Government decides to go ahead, a judge considering sentence
will be able to look up the database to see the sentences previously
passed for similar cases.''
Lord Ross provided the impetus for the project after seeing a similar
system operating in New South Wales, Australia.
With the backing of Lord Hope, the Lord Justice-General, he is
convinced the system can help increase public confidence in sentencing
without removing judicial discretion.
Lord Ross said: ''The value of this system is that it can provide a
judge with quick and easy access to complete and up-to-date information
about what his colleagues decided to do when faced with similar cases.''
He added: ''If it is introduced, the system will be an invaluable
guide, but there is no question of the computer dictating to a judge
what the sentence has to be.''

THE new head of Customs and Excise in Scotland yesterday forecast
better performances than ever -- despite swingeing staff cuts under the
Government's review of Civil Service jobs.
Mr Campbell Arnott was adamant that more revenue will be collected --
and successes in anti-smuggling wars will increase, regardless of the
near 25% cut in jobs over the next five years.
He insisted that new technology, improved intelligence gathering and
other changes will more than make up for the manpower reductions,
especially in the war against drugs.
Mr Arnott was speaking for the first time since the merger of
Scotland's two Customs and Excise headquarters in Edinburgh and Glasgow
as a ''single executive unit'' on April 1.
Last night, his claims were dismissed as ''sheer nonsense'' by the
Civil and Public Services Association. The union's Scottish secretary,
Mr Michael McCann, noting the merger date, said: ''Only a fool could
make sense of the argument that fewer staff leads to improved
services.''
More than 4000 Customs and Excise job losses, including 600 frontline
anti-drugs officers, were signalled throughout the UK in the Budget
speech by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in November.
Scotland's 1650-strong force is scheduled to fall by 350 to 400,
according to Mr Arnott, appointed as Customs and Excise's first
Collector-Scotland.
He said that up to 30 anti-smuggling jobs will go, with the majority
of losses, 275, involving VAT staff. The merger of Scotland's two
collection headquarters also means cuts in senior management and
administration.
Mr Arnott insisted that the end result will be an increase in
efficiency and value for money and that revenue recovered from
businesses will increase as systems for collections, targetting, and
rigorous auditing become more sophisticated.
He also denied that a loss of permanent anti-smuggling cover at
Scotland's airports, coastal ports and docks will exacerbate the growing
drugs problem.
Since the Government's review of operations, the number of Customs and
Excise collection headquarters in the UK has fallen from 21 to 14.
Mr Arnott, in charge of 1500 staff in offices as far afield as
Shetland and Dumfries, confirmed it is probable that small offices, such
as Galashiels or Kirkcaldy, will also close.

<HEADLINE>Dounreay attacked over waste shaft</HEADLINE>

THERE was renewed concern yesterday over a disused radioactive waste
shaft at Dounreay.
With a report on its future due out this month, a leading anti-nuclear
campaigner claimed a legacy of complacency and neglect had stored up an
environmental timebomb.
Mrs Lorraine Mann, a member of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, said
no-one ''knows exactly what went down there''.
The UK Atomic Energy authority, however, says it has an accurate
inventory of the materials in the shaft, which is constantly pumped out
and monitored. It insists the public has no cause for concern and that
it has the situation under control.
The shaft was excavated in the mid 1950s to link into Dounreay's
original discharge pipeline to the Pentland Firth.
It was subsequently sealed off and until 1977 was used as a dump for a
variety of radioactive waste from the site.
In that year there was an explosion, which blew a concrete lid off the
shaft, since when it has lain dormant.
The 65-metre-deep shaft has been the subject of a number of reports.
One study carried out for the Department of Environment raised concern
about its radioactive cocktail. It pointed to possible long-term
contamination of surrounding rocks and the potential for future
explosions.
The shaft has also been linked with radioactive hot-spots found on
Dounreay's foreshore.
Mrs Mann, said highly radioactive material had been dumped ''willy
nilly'' in the shaft.
Dounreay spokesman Ian Shepherd denied the UKAEA has been complacent
or neglectful.
As well as now having an accurate inventory, he said that ''we have
also over a period of some years carried out a number of reviews and
surveys to determine options for dealing with the future of the shaft''.
Mr Shepherd said the UKAEA has provided information to the radioactive
waste advisory committee (Rawmac) which has been investigating what to
do with the shaft.
Rawmac is expected to publish its report at the end of this month.
A Scottish Information Office spokesman said there is no cause for
public concern.

A PRIVATE contracting firm was accused last night of withholding
hospital porters' back pay, to pressure them into accepting new and
inferior working conditions.
Forty porters at Hairmyres Hospital, East Kilbride, are to go on
indefinite strike a week today in protest at their treatment, their
union, Unison, announced.
Two security guards at Udston geriatric hospital, run by the Hairmyres
and Stonehouse Trust, are also affected, and the dispute could disrupt
laundry services which Hairmyres carry out for other hospitals,
including the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow, as well the delivery of
meals, collection of specimens and disposal of clinical waste in
Hairmyres.
Unison organiser Mrs Bridget Hunter claimed that contractors Pall Mall
were withholding cash given to them by the trust for a 2.39% pay rise,
including back-payments to last June when Pall Mall took over the
contract.
''The porters' take-home pay is #103 a week, but Pall Mall want to
remove enhanced payments for late-shift working and overtime,'' said Mrs
Hunter.
''They have also derecognised the union -- we have tried on several
occasions to discuss these issues with Pall Mall, to prevent this strike
action, but they have consistently ignored us.''
She added that the trust was ''aware of the misuse of these funds, but
so far have done nothing except make sympathetic noises''.
No-one was available at the hospital to comment on behalf of the trust
or Pall Mall last night.

<HEADLINE>Eight years for raiders foiled by woman, 75</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979042550</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO raiders, one of whom had a sawn-off shotgun, who tried to steal a
charity box from a 75-year-old woman shopkeeper were each sentenced to
eight years yesterday.
The elderly woman, Mrs Janina Hermann, jammed one of the raiders'
fingers in the till and he dropped both the collection box and #5 he had
snatched from the takings.
Alan Wright, 20, from Goschen Terrace, and Stuart MacMichael, 24, from
Almondell Road, both Broxburn, in West Lothian, admitted staging the
robbery at a shop in Glasgow Road, Ratho Station, on November 30 last
year.
They also admitted a #128 armed robbery with a sawn-off shotgun at
Burbecks Stores, Station Road, Kirkliston, also in West Lothian, on
December 5 last year.
Temporary judge Hazel Aronson, QC, told them at the High Court in
Edinburgh: ''You have both pled guilty to charges of assault using a
sawn-off shotgun, both causing great alarm.
''The courts have a duty to protect shopkeepers from this type of
assault and to make it quite plain that this type of attack using a
shotgun will not be tolerated.''
Advocate depute Ralph Smith said that in the first raid Wright had
gone into the small shop and bought a drink.
When the till was opened he lunged for the cash, grabbing five #1
notes, but Mrs Hermann jammed his fingers in the till.
Wright managed to free his hand but dropped the money and also lost
hold of a charity box he had snatched.
MacMichael was the getaway driver and played the same role in the
second robbery in Kirkliston.
Wright pulled on a balaclava and went into the shop pointing the gun
at the shop assistant, Ms Karen Forrest, 32, and forced her to open the
till, before grabbing the cash and fleeing.
Defence counsel for Wright, Mr Jack Davidson, said the unloaded gun
was incapable of being fired and pointed out that neither woman was
injured in the attacks.
Mr Gary Allan, for MacMichael, said his client had been unemployed at
the time of the crimes and feared he was going to be evicted from his
council house because of rent arrears.
The judge sentenced Wright to eight years' detention and MacMichael to
eight years' imprisonment.

ANGRY exchanges continued yesterday between the Scottish Office and
Strathclyde region over the future cost of water services in Scotland.
The council's Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, said he was
''outraged'' at the Government's attack on the independence of a recent
report commissioned by the council.
It criticised the cost of Government plans to bring more private
finance into the provision of water and sewerage projects by the use of
''Build, Own and Operate'' schemes.
Earlier this week, the Scottish Local Government Minister, Mr George
Kynoch, in a letter to Councillor Gould, claimed the tone of the report,
by the Chemical Bank, was ''partisan''.
But, replying in a letter yesterday, the council leader insisted it
was the Scottish Office which had closed its mind, and added: ''It
appears determined to pursue its dogma and bring in BOO schemes whatever
the cost.''
The Minister, he went on, was claiming that private investors in BOO
schemes must be free to make investment decisions and come up with low
cost solutions.
However, on issues of public safety, the water authorities had a
responsibility to specify or to be satisfied with the specifications of
any BOO project.
''You say this is restrictive,'' the letter continued. ''We say this
is responsible.''
Councillor Gould added that Strathclyde had sought an open debate on
the future financing of water.
''We have published our figures and our research -- you have not. I
believe we will be proved right in the years to come.
''There is no doubt in our minds that he best way to finance the
future of water in Scotland is through the normal public financing.''
Under Government legislation three new public water authorities will
take over control of council-run water services on April 1 1996.

Julia Langdon relates how a writer's fascination for the romance and
mystery of the fabulous Amber Room helped end his nightmare
THE story of the Amber Room involves one of the great unsolved
mysteries of our time. It was truly gorgeous; a room panelled from six
tons of carved Baltic amber, presented to Peter the Great in 1716 for
the palace of the Prussian Emperor. It was fabulous -- but now it is
just that, only a fable: it was seized from the Catherine Palace at
Pushkin by the Germans in 1941, reconstructed at Konigsberg, dismantled
in 1945 on top-level orders from Berlin and has never been seen again.
It is, by any measure, a gripping start to a thriller. The author
Christopher Matthew found himself standing in what was once the Amber
Room, in the rebuilt Catherine Palace in Pushkin, and was enthralled by
the story. As a writer, among other things for television, he saw a
dramatic potential for the mystery and envisaged it initially as a
six-part children's TV series.
But nothing quite works out the way it is expected in this story, as
Matthew explained when we met. He had shortly beforehand embarked upon
writing a novel, based on an odd experience after a ski-ing accident in
Switzerland. He was being stitched up by a German doctor who showed him
a curious badge dating from the Second World War. Matthew learned, to
his considerable surprise, of a group of disillusioned British soldiers
who had volunteered to join the SS out of the German prison camps.
One can see that both of these different starting points to different
adventure stories would offer an attractive potential for a writer.
There is a basis of interesting reality: it was like this, there were
British who joined the SS; there was an Amber Room and it is missing.
And there is a magical quality, too, a common element of mystery and
fantasy which is difficult to define.
What Matthew has now done -- to his own considerable surprise -- is
put the stories together. The result is a potent mixture, a heady,
action-packed thriller which races across countries and pulls together
into a terrific story relating both what really happened and what might
have been.
But his success is also significant because he wrote the book against
the backcloth of a complete loss of self-confidence in his own writing.
It is every writer's nightmare: not writer's block exactly, but
something far more frightening, the ghastly sense of just not being able
to do it any more. Christopher Matthew is a man of 55 who has made a
good living from writing, supporting his family and enjoying a
comfortable lifestyle. He is probably best known as the author of The
Diary of a Somebody and he has written three further books chronicling
the life and times of his hero Simon Crisp. He wrote a book called The
Long-Haired Boy, adapted for television as A Perfect Hero, a humorous
handbook, How To Survive Middle Age, and is responsible for numerous
television and radio scripts.
He is a professional. I have personal experience of this because we
used to contribute to the same radio programme on a regular basis and
met often in the studios. He wrote lovely, funny scripts and had an
innate professionalism which one might have imagined was unshakeable.
But, boy, was he shaken.
What happened was that he sent the first four chapters of his
projected novel about British Nazis to a literary agent who had taken on
the idea. The agent wrote Matthew a letter which he has still and can
clearly recite by heart. It froze him.
''He said that I wasn't a writer at all; that I didn't know how to
write fiction; that I wrote like a journalist; that I had no narrative
skills and, basically, why didn't I write more like John Le Carre or Len
Deighton -- whereupon I stopped writing completely for a year. Every
time I wrote a word, I could hear him saying: 'I'm afraid this simply
won't do. You are not a writer'.''
Christopher Matthew can talk about this now. He got caught up by the
romance of the Amber Room, talked the project over with the publisher
Christopher Sinclair-Stevenson and -- without the benefit of an agent --
has produced a book which the publisher has described as ''unequivocally
the most exciting adventure novel I have ever published''.
Sinclair-Stevenson told him: ''You're as capable of telling me a good
story as any agent.''
It is with some justification then that Matthew can say now: ''I began
to think that maybe agents could be, in certain circumstances, very
dangerous people. There is a great danger of them being more important
than their clients.''
It was some time before the agent, one of the leading literary agents
in the country, learned that he had upset Matthew. He was apparently
astonished and claimed that he had thought he was being helpful.
''Helpful!'' Matthew is still indignant.
''I was destroyed by it for a year and he asks why I don't talk to him
any more!'' The indications are that it is Christopher Matthew who will
have the last laugh. He deserves to do so not just because he has
written an enthralling book, but because it is encouraging to any writer
to know that someone has taken a swipe at the over-mighty middlemen who
increasingly dominate publishing.
He has another personal reason for relief that he has now published
this story. His hero, Miles Maltby, is a freelance journalist, an
ex-Army officer and the kind of character that would have been created
by John Buchan if he was writing today. He is a clean-cut decent chap, a
man not unlike Christopher Matthew himself in many ways. In one of the
opening sequences -- although, like Matthew, he is an expert ski-ier --
he experiences a very nasty ski-ing accident. The author describes
exactly what happened to him for the purposes of the narrative.
It was only when Matthew had finished writing the book, a long time
later, that he began suffering severe headaches. It was so long since
the ski-ing accident that he did not connect the two until a doctor
asked if he had ever suffered a severe blow to the head. The trauma had
been suppressed while he was writing and only emerged with the relief of
its completion. All his headaches have gone now.

A COUNCILLOR suspended by Labour after his conviction for assaulting a
woman defied his party yesterday to insist that a legal victory meant he
could describe himself as an official candidate tomorrow.
''I am now official, legal Labour candidate: I was never in any doubt
about that,'' Paisley councillor Paul Mack said yesterday after the
party failed to contest an interdict concerning his ban.
The Labour Party begged to differ. ''He is not, never has been and
cannot be the official Labour candidate,'' Scottish general secretary
Jack McConnell said.
''He was rejected from the panel of candidates and his appeal was
rejected fairly but firmly. His suspension from participation in the
current Labour group on the current Renfrew District Council has been
withdrawn on a technicality and will be reviewed by the national
executive in the near future.''
Councillor Mack, however, indicated yesterday that in canvassing he
would be describing himself as official Labour candidate. He called his
party's continuing rejection of him ''esoteric, a bit of sophistry,''
adding: ''As far as I am concerned there is a leaflet going out now
saying I am official Labour candidate and that is all there is to it.''
The councillor was fined #200 last year after being found guilty of
assaulting a woman with whom he had a longstanding relationship, a
conviction his solicitor told the court would finish his political
career.
He likened his subsequent suspension from the party, in a hearing
presided over by four women, to O. J. Simpson being judged by the Ku
Klux Klan. He was banned from contesting the Hunterhill ward in
tomorrow's election but re-entered the fray at the eleventh hour when
the officially sanctioned candidate withdrew.
Mr McConnell concluded: ''In our democracy people can stand for
election and call themselves almost anything, but at the end of the day
voters will realise what is going on.''
Frances Horsburgh, Local Government Correspondent, writes: Shadow
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook yesterday predicted Labour would win
control of the new single-tier West Lothian Council.
West Lothian District Council is currently run by a minority SNP
administration.
The Livingston MP claimed that the tide was now very much in favour of
the Labour Party locally and nationally.
Following visits to Bosnia, Russia and Rwanda Mr Cook warned of the
dangers of creeping nationalism. He said that when people were led into
isolation with narrow-minded nationalism it inevitably led to the
breakdown of relationships.
''Clearly this is not the path that we should be following:
co-operation and the coming together of different people is the only
lasting way forward.''
Mr Cook claimed that the Labour Party was fielding its strongest ever
team in West Lothian. They were a mix of experienced district
councillors and talented regional councillors and a number of new faces
who would add much to the new group.

Allan Laing, the first British journalist to see Rob Roy before its
New York premiere tonight, heralds a tartan triumph
PETER Broughan knew he'd cracked it a split second after the villain's
throat was slashed. Liam Neeson's claymore was still dripping blood when
the audience delivered a spontaneous burst of applause. You tend to know
you have something rather special on your hands when cinema patrons,
particularly in London's laid-back West End, clap their hands and cheer
wildly. That kind of thing rarely happens in a picture house.
The moment was a magical one for Broughan. It went with him on a jet
plane the following morning as he headed off for New York to attend the
US premiere of Rob Roy -- not just a movie; more a way of life over the
past 18 months for the Scots film producer and ex-BBC Scotland script
editor.
Like most of Broughan's mates, I have lived through the tears and the
joys of the making of the movie since it first came up as a subject for
discussion in the pub. The idea of a Glasgow film maker, unknown and
unproven in Hollywood, actually getting his unashamedly ambitious
project off the ground (far less completed) was . . . well, it was
fanciful. We thought.
But we underestimated Broughan's talents and tenacity. He went off to
New Zealand and talked Alan Sharp, one of Scotland's finest
screenwriters, out of his self-imposed hibernation and into writing the
script. He lined up Michael Caton-Jones, on a brief visit to Edinburgh
for the film festival before last, and persuaded him to direct his first
film on his home ground. And, along with Caton-Jones and co-producer
Richard Jackson, he arranged finance with a major Hollywood studio.
And yet, sitting in the Empire Cinema in London's Leicester Square at
the weekend, waiting for the curtain to rise for a special screening
(the first ever) of the movie, you couldn't help but worry. How would
you face him if it turned out to be a bad film? Or, worse still perhaps,
if it were only average? Would you lie? Would you say: ''Umm, very good,
Peter''? Or would you just skulk away into the night, unable to utter
the awful truth about his great labour of love?
Then you watch the movie. And you keep waiting for something to go
wrong. But it doesn't. It starts off well -- and then it just gets
better until you suddenly realise that what you are watching is one of
the best films you've seen all year. And you're not just saying that
because the producer's your pal.
No. You try to be critical; you try to find faults. But there aren't
very many (maybe 20 minutes too long, that's all). And then -- when the
villain is slain -- you clap and cheer. And you think to yourself:
''When's the last time you did that at the movies? Maybe never.''
When the credits have rolled, you find yourself in the foyer glancing
over at a (relieved) Broughan being feted and congratulated by the
London film and media set. Eventually, he catches your eye and comes
over.
''Well, what did you think?'' he asks. And the clever, erudite phrases
you have carefully recorded in your notebook disappear from the mind.
''F...ing great, Peter!'' you say. And you mean it. Then you wander off
to get drunk together.
Rob Roy is a powerful historical epic, pitching a wonderful love story
against a swashbuckling tale of pure adventure. It is unapologetically
old-fashioned, evoking memories of those Redcoats v Highlanders movies
of the fifties and sixties. There is no dubiety about the film. The
villains are wickedly bad; the heroes fierce epitomes of probity. This
is its greatest strength.
Sharp's script is worth its weight in gold. It is finely crafted,
often witty and always beautifully paced. It is almost prose-like in its
quality. He takes the bare historical facts of Rob Roy's life and weaves
them into a tale of honour and duty; a story about a good and decent man
whose integrity is put to the test when he is caught up in circumstances
which are way beyond his control.
Caton-Jones's direction is excellent, quite the best he has done. He
has surely found his metier with this vast, sprawling epic,
ably-assisted by the dark, menacing backdrop of the Scottish Highlands.
It is the lead-up to the Jacobite Rebellion and clan leader Robert Roy
MacGregor (Liam Neeson), in a bid to make money to feed his starving
people, borrows #1000 from the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). But the
money is stolen by the Marquis's evil and amoral swordsman, Archibald
Cunningham (Tim Roth) before it reaches MacGregor. Rob Roy, left with a
huge debt to pay, is offered a deal. If he denounces Montrose's
neighbour and arch-enemy, the decent Duke of Argyll (Andrew Keir), as a
Jacobite, then the Marquis will forget about the #1000.
But Rob Roy is a man of honour. When he declines the offer, he and his
men are denounced as outlaws. The duplicitous Cunningham is sent to hunt
him down and, in the process, he destroys the MacGregor village and
brutally rapes Rob Roy's wife Mary (Jessica Lange).
Neeson and Lange burn a sensual passion between them in the romantic
lead roles and, it has to be said, they acquit themselves rather well in
the circumstances with their Scottish accents. So too does Eric Stoltz
as Rob Roy's ill-fated friend, Alan MacDonald. But the star of the film
is undoubtedly Tim Roth as the fey and foppish rogue Cunningham. It is a
quite memorable performance. He creates a truly despicable character;
almost like a pantomime dame but with a lethal sociopath underneath the
frills and frippery.
The film's climax, when Rob Roy with his claymore finally faces the
evil Cunningham with his sabre, is surely one of the finest movie sword
duels since Douglas Fairbanks Jnr hung up his foil. There is a great
moment when Roth, preparing himself for the fight, carefully removes his
wig. Suddenly, the fop has gone and the true nature of the beast is
revealed.
It is also worth noting that the film features first-class
performances from some of Scotland's finest actors, including Brian Cox
(utterly convincing as Cunningham's greed-driven accomplice, Killearn),
Ewan Stewart (who's father, Andy, would be proud of him in his kilt),
and young Brian McCardie (a splendid new talent making his feature-film
debut as Rob Roy's impetuous wee brother). The movie also features a
brief but sterling performance from David Hayman -- but I defy anyone to
recognise him under his make-up.

BT'S Number One day for changing dialling codes is April 16 but the
SNP's Number One day will be April 6, party leaders predicted yesterday.
They were full of confidence about the party's results in the local
elections at a press conference in Edinburgh yesterday.
SNP vice president Andrew Welsh, MP, said they had started the
campaign on a high and this had continued as they had met people on the
doorsteps.
He claimed the Tories had disappeared into the abyss of failure at the
regional elections last year. It was now a battle of the giants between
Labour and the SNP with the Nationalists as the contenders.
''From Lochaber to Dumfries and Galloway, in award-winning Grampian,
in Tayside, Angus and West Lothian SNP councillors now have invaluable
hand-on experience of running local authorities,'' he said.
The party's ''Fresh Start'' principles were firmly based on that
experience.
Councillor Maureen Watt, the SNP's vice convener for local government,
said the Tories were not in the frame in these elections. The
Nationalists' campaign had put Labour on to the back foot and they were
''running around like headless chickens'' in some areas trying to combat
the SNP.
She said the party's progressive style of running councils had been
confirmed independently during the campaign when SNP-controlled West
Lothian and Grampian were named as the only Scottish finalists in the
Society of Local Authority Chief Executives UK-wide Total Quality
Management awards, with Grampian emerging as the overall winner.
The SNP's policies represented a powerful electoral challenge to the
inconsistency and opportunism of Labour, she claimed.
A PLEA from Arbroath SNP councillor Ian Angus to Historic Scotland to
fly the Scottish Saltire over Arbroath Abbey tomorrow, to mark the
anniversary of Robert the Bruce signing the Scottish Declaration of
Independence in 1320, has been turned down.
The given reason is that in normal circumstances Historic Scotland
flies its house flag over its properties and on special occasions,
however, they would fly the Union Jack, the last occasion being the
birthday of Prince Edward.
Councillor Angus said: ''Surely the anniversary of the Arbroath
Declaration is a special occasion and the Saltire flag should be flown.
Angus District Council flies it all year from public buildings
throughout the county.''

ZANY will almost certainly be the word pressed into over-time as
cultural commentators seek to summarise the talents of Kenny Everett,
who died yesterday of an Aids-related illness, aged 50.
His radio persona was marked by a clownish craziness throughout its
near 30-year span. There was gusto and stubbornness, too. When it came
to playing the wise fool, few people have ever pushed the role as far
towards its limits of public acceptability.
Just over a year ago, when doggedly attempting a return to work at
London's Capital Radio after being diagnosed HIV positive, Everett was
unable to resist a ghoulish double-edged quip directed at a group of
fans who were waiting outside Capital's studios.
''I'm dying, and you're calling for Tony Blackburn,'' he chided them.
His last broadcasts were made soon afterwards.
Born Maurice Cole in Liverpool, Everett first emerged on pirate radio,
on Radio Caroline, in the mid-sixties in the immediate wake of the
Merseybeat boom. Not unnaturally, his fashionably laconic Scouse manner
-- as well as the fact he frequently seemed to be broadcasting from
outer space rather than a heaving boat in the English Channel -- swiftly
brought him to the attention of the nascent Radio 1.
Once established on officially-sanctioned airwaves, however, Everett
typically tried his best to subvert the authority of the BBC. Having
revealed himself as the possessor of a keen comic sensibility, plus a
range of daft voices, he employed both to mock the Establishment at
every opportunity.
Everett was sacked by Radio 1 in 1970 for passing an instant verdict
on a news bulletin about the wife of the then-Minister of Transport
having passed her driving test. His reading of events was that bribery,
in the form of a fiver, might well have been involved.
But he was back with Radio 1 two years later. His pioneering shows --
which always employed the possibilities of recorded sound to the full --
still gave rein to his iconoclastic vision. To listen to a Kenny Everett
radio show was always to enter the world of his imagination, one which
was peopled by comic grotesques to whom he had given life on tape.
In so doing, Everett accelerated the trend of the disc jockey as a
personality in his own right, rather than a mere functionary of the
discs he was playing. Few of the DJs who followed his lead ever got it
as right as Kenny Everett did, because he was genuinely funny.
Inevitably, Everett's high-profile ability as a laughter-maker was
recognised by TV programme-makers. He hosted the Kenny Everett Video
Show -- using the studio-zoo format which has only recently become one
of TV's stylistic staples -- with notable success for Thames Televison
at the end of the seventies.
At its peak, the show attracted 15 million viewers with its
near-nudity and close-to-the-knuckle bad taste. The gyrations of the Hot
Gossip dance troupe provided visual stimulation of one sort; the bearded
Everett's appearance in drag as a flamboyantly-improper floozy rejoicing
in the name Cupid Stunt provided more of another -- plus a catchphrase
which meant exactly the opposite of what it promised.
There could be no doubt about the intended comic effect when Cupid
crossed and re-crossed her legs whilst lisping in shrieking tones about
everything being ''in the best possible taste!''
Paradoxically, Everett's private life was deeply confused for many
years, as he admitted in an autobiography. His marriage to Leigh Everett
was a failed attempt to convince himself he wasn't homosexual. When he
eventually came out, it was to reveal that he was living in a homosexual
menage a trois.
However, his utterances in 1983, whilst a top-table guest at a
pre-election Young Conservative rally, were even more disturbing. As
well as urging the bombing of Russia, Everett called upon his
fellow-Tories to attack the aged leader of the Labour Party and ''kick
Michael Foot's stick away''.
But that was Kenny Everett: a prince of inspired bad taste, original,
and brave.

IF you think ''self-build'' homes means spending months in a sea of
mud and humping piles of bricks around, then you are wrong. And an
exhibition this weekend will prove it.
This will be the third consecutive year that the Self Build Homes
Exhibition will have been held at Glasgow's Marriott Hotel. The event is
proving such a success that from next year it is to be held at the more
spacious Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre.
Its organisers, Build It magazine, anticipate that up to 2500 people
will visit on Saturday and Sunday. And it certainly seems a must for
anyone toying with the idea of living in a home designed by themselves
and built at a price within their budget.
Scots home-makers are keener on self-build than their English
counterparts. ''One reason is the greater availability of land,'' says
Sue Woodward, publicity manager for the exhibition.
''Another is the popularity of timber-frame in Scotland: Scots don't
need to worry too much about weather when the actual frame of one of
these kits can be up and watertight within days. There is certainly some
attraction in being able to choose everything about one's new home
including the location, size and shapes of room, design, heating system,
and the materials used. The self-builder has the final say on
everything, from fixtures and fittings to decor.
All of this is done at what is reckoned to be average savings of
20%-30% on the cost of the new home because the developer's profit
margin has been eliminated.
One couple featured in the current edition of Build It laid out a
total of #78,300 including all professional fees and services on
building a, six-apartment bungalow in North Yorkshire. They lived in a
caravan on-site while the builders got on with it, and kept on their
full-time jobs. But five months later they had a home worth #150,000.
There will be a free advice centre, and plenty of information on offer
for those considering an Aga Rayburn in the kitchen or a Jacuzzi in the
bathroom.

LABOUR last night claimed its campaign to highlight ''fiddled''
unemployment figures had been justified after a report by the Royal
Statistical Society said the jobless calculations were widely mistrusted
and should be revamped.
A damning study by an RSS working party, chaired by society president
Professor David Bartholomew, finds that, after 30 changes in the way
they are calculated, unemployment figures are not trusted by the general
public, many politicians and the media and should no longer be used as
the monthly headline jobless figure.
The society recommends instead a redesigned monthly assessment, based
on the quarterly Labour Force Survey -- in line with Labour's proposals.
Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman described the report as a
vindication of the stand taken by deputy Labour leader John Prescott,
who had consistently argued that the figures understated the jobless
total by up to two million, and said it proved once again that the Tory
Government could not be trusted.
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is regarded by the working party as ''a
superior source of information both for employment and unemployment''
whereas the present system based on those claiming benefits ''is not
trusted, is not based on any agreed concept of unemployment, is
inconsistent over time due to changes in the claimant system and cannot
be used for international comparisons''.
The study enumerates the 30 changes to the method of calculating the
jobless statistics instigated by Conservative governments since 1979,
which together took well over 1.5 million off the unemployment lists.
Among the most significant was in 1982 when the count was changed from
an account of those registering at Job Centres to one of claimants for
unemployment-related benefits. This removed some 216,000 from the totals
at a stroke.
As a result of that change the system excludes those seeking work but
not claiming related benefits and those deemed ineligible for benefits.
There are at least seven references in the report to widespread
mistrust of the statistics, but the working party stresses that there
had been ''no suggesion that the published figures had in any way been
fiddled''.

<TEXT>
THE godson of the Prince of Wales, Tom Parker Bowles, will not be
punished by his Oxford college after reports that he was arrested for
carrying drugs, it was confirmed yesterday.
The son of the prince's close friend, Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles, is
studying English at Worcester College, whose Bursar, Mr David King, said
it was not a college matter.
It is thought that the 20-year-old undergraduate was cautioned by
police after being held in south London with another student for
carrying small amounts of ecstasy and cannabis.
Mr King said: ''I do not believe this will attract any college
disciplinary procedures. It didn't happen in college grounds.'' College
misdemeanours were normally punished with a small fine but if drugs were
involved it would be more severe, he added.
Mr King said that while he knew who Mr Parker Bowles was, he did not
know him well enough to comment on the allegations.
Newspaper reports claimed that Tom Parker Bowles and his friend, Henry
Mainwaring, were stopped and searched by police outside Star's
nightclub, Greenwich, on April 1.
Worcester College's former students include Tim Sainsbury and Rupert
Murdoch.

A STAR shinty player is the subject of a report to the
procurator-fiscal at Inverness for an alleged assault on a referee after
he was sent off during a cup match.
Yesterday police in Inverness confirmed that their inquiries into the
alleged incident during a game between Lovat and Fort William had been
completed and that a report had been sent to the fiscal.
Lovat's skipper, Roddy Munro, has already been given a nine-game ban
by the Camanachd Association, the game's ruling body, which will see him
out of action for the rest of this season and the start of next.
In February referee Donald MacFadyen, of Inverness, sustained a
bruised lip and bleeding mouth after Fort William's 5-0 away win over
Lovat, in the village of Kiltarlity, near Inverness.
Munro, 28, was dismissed from the hard-fought game for dissension and
swearing.

DAVIDSTON, a romantic property near Keith in the central Highlands, is
one of the last fortified houses to be built in Scotland and was
constructed in the classic L-plan with two round turrets, a cottage wing
and domestic building which form an inner courtyard.
Just after the Second World War, historian A C Hughie described the
House of Davidston as ''a most remarkable and characteristic example of
a 17th Century laird's fortified house with some of its original
outbuilding attached. This architectural gem, with its decorated
corbelled turrets and slit windows, is little altered externally since
its building in 1678.
''With its corbie-stepped gables it is a delightful example of the
typical dwelling house of a Banffshire laird.''
Such houses were designed so that the laird and his family and
retainers could defend themselves against the attacks of armed bands of
caterans, often demobbed soldiers who plundered and pillaged their way
around the country.
Hughie added: ''There are all too few surviving specimens of this
rugged and delightful Scottish domestic architecture deriving in style
from the French chateau, and of which the Scots baronial building was
the direct descendant.''
Over the last 20 years, the castle has been restored meticulously and
painstakingly to its original glory, with acknowledgement to modern
comforts.
William Jackson of selling agents Knight Frank &amp; Rutley says: ''The
craftsmanship which has been bestowed upon this caste is of a quality
seldom found today and this has blended in perfect harmony with the
original building.''
The work has included the re-creation of windows, studded doors and
the staircase using old oak and pine. The stonework has also been
faithfully restored by a local stonemason. During the restoration work
new bathrooms, using traditional style fittings, were constructed and
central heating was installed.
''The result is a completely restored castle with enormous character
and presence, which provides a unusual and yet practical style of
accommodation,''. says William Jackson.
Davidston, like the Burn of Davidston which runs alongside it, is
believed to have taken its name from David de Strathbogie, Earl of
Atholl, who fought against Bruce and after whose fall the great
North-east clan of Gordon became established.
''Dawestoun'' is entered in the Earl of Huntly's renewed charter of
1545 as forming part of the barony ''de Huntlie alas Strabogy'. John
Gordon, a son of John Gordon off Thorneybank near Buckie, acquired
Davidston between the years 1670 and 1673 and built the mansion house in
its castellated form in the year 1678. His initials, and those of his
wife (Jean Abercrombie) as well as the year of its construction are
carved into the stonework.
The low building with the large chimney which forms most of the east
of the courtyard was the kitchen with its great fireplace and oven. As
was the tradition in many old houses, this was completely isolated from
the main house because it was prone to catching fire and was difficult
to defend.
Montrose and his royalist army camped beside Davidston between his
victories over the Convenanting armies at Auldear and Alford, their last
victory before defeat at Culloden.
The ownership of Davidston passed from the Gordons to the Duffs in
1700 and until recently remained in the ownership of the Gordon Duff
family. For almost 100 years, the castle had been virtually derelict.
Davidston is on an old by-way on the borders of Aberdeenshire and
Banffshire leading from Huntly and Keith and wending its way uphill to
Dufftown, some seven miles distant. The great mountain of Ben Rinnes
dominates the west and the Highland glens of Cabrach, Glenlivet,
Glenavon and Strathspey stretch away to the south-west.
The Burn of Davidston which flows along the western boundary of the
property forms the country boundary between Aberdeenshire and
Banffshire.
The accommodation at Davidston includes a great hall, dining room,
study, kitchen/breakfast room with Aga, five/six bedrooms, and two
bathrooms. The inner courtyard has a self contained cottage wing with
three/four bedrooms. Extensive outbuildings include garages and
workshop. There is a sheltered, secluded and sunny courtyard,
conservatory, two-acre pony paddock, and about four acres.
The adjoining cottage and outbuildings have all been restored to the
same exacting standards. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley are quoting offers over
#275,000.

LOTHIAN councillors could be asked to bring their cars in at the
beginning of each financial year to have their mileage checked against
expenses claims.
The proposal comes in the wake of a row over expenses claimed by West
Lothian Labour councillor Terry Coleman, who has since resigned.
Councillor Coleman claimed #10,457 to and from his home in South
Shields and was due #6115 in back-money which has not been paid.
Chairman of the council's miscellaneous services committee, SNP
councillor Frank Anderson, said his committee had made the suggestion to
officials.
He said: ''We have asked them to look at the feasibility of getting
every councillor to bring their cars in at the start of the financial
year to have their mileage checked.
''We believe that would be one way of making sure councillors' travel
expenses claims are monitored.''
Earlier, both the Labour Party, and the Independent Conservative
councillor, Ms Isobel Brydie, made it clear they wanted tighter scrutiny
of travel expense claims.

<HEADLINE>Stone stolen from South Uist is found in London</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979042563</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN ancient carved stone which was stolen from the Western Isles five
years ago has been discovered in a gutted London flat.
The 360lb memorial stone, believed to date from the sixteenth century
and which is carved with the arms of Clanranald, was found in a flat
being renovated at Burton Street in Euston.
The flat was in need of urgent repair and was being prepared for
renovation by the owners, Paddington Churches Housing Association.
Four weeks ago, the Canadian parents of the previous occupier, who had
recently died, were clearing out their late son's possessions.
Mr David Maben, from Ontario, noticed the stone's ornate carving and
contacted Ms Cathy Haith, curator of the Department of Mediaeval and
Later Antiquities, at the British Museum.
Ms Haith, a specialist in Anglo Saxon material, immediately recognised
the carving on the stone as being late mediaeval Celtic, and contacted
the National Museum for Scotland, which confirmed the stone is the same
one reported stolen from South Uist in 1990.
Ms Haith said: ''It is very unusual, and a fascinating story. I've
been here almost 20 years and I have never known anything like this.''
There was a furore when the stone, a picture of which is the logo for
the Southern Isles Amenity Trust, disappeared from the isle's disused
cemetery at Howmore.
Mr Neil Macmillan, chairman of the South Uist Historical Society,
said: ''This stone goes back several hundred years. It had lain in the
Howmore Cemetery which is now closed.
''We believe it is the only stone of its kind in the world still
virtually undamaged. We could not understand why it was stolen.''
Canon Angus Macqueen, the local priest in South Uist in 1990, said:
''One day I noticed the Clanranald stone had gone. When we examined the
area, we found marks showing the stone had been dragged away -- probably
in the night.''
It may never be known how the stone came to be in London, but a map
found with it in the flat indicated where it was taken from.
But, whoever the author was, they had little knowledge of the islands
as the spot marked is not in South Uist, but in North Uist, 40 miles
away.
Dr Noel Fojut, of Historic Scotland, said prosecutions could be
brought for the illegal removal of a protected ancient monument, ''but
that is unlikely in this case''.

AN innovative plan to set up a fast rail link between Edinburgh city
centre and Penicuik could see a train service running in Midlothian for
the first time in 25 years.
A #150m proposal has been lodged with the Millennium Commission by
Midlothain District Council, which hopes to capitalise on facilities to
tour historic estates, and provide a direct rail link for commuters to
the city centre.
The council believes the rail link, called the Millennorail, meets the
criteria outlined by the Government fund to applicants seeking grant
funding.
Vice convener, Councillor George Purcell, said yesterday: ''It would
place Scotland's past on a fast track for the third millennium.
''It also represents an unrivalled opportunity to restore and develop
the full potential of four of Midlothian's once-great historic houses
and estates.
''As well as the environmental advantages of making these attractions
accessible without increasing road traffic, the Millennorail route would
improve normal commuting and travel between Midlothian and Edinburgh
city centre.''
The council's policy and development officer, Mr Ian Young, who said
costings had been provided by independent consultants, said he felt the
commission's guidelines placed a major emphasis on projects which would
be of benefit to the environment, afford educational advantages, and
display scientific and technological expertise.''
The proposed route is from the eighteenth-century Penicuik House --
destroyed by fire in 1899 -- passing through Roslin Glen Country Park,
past Melville Castle, and Dalkeith House, before heading north to
Edinburgh.
If given the go-ahead, six new stations would be built at Penicuik,
Roslin, Mavisbank, Melville, and Dalkeith.

SENIOR management at BBC Scotland were not told of the Panorama
interview with Mr Major. They knew nothing about the programme,
subsequently banned by Scottish courts, until they read details of a
leaked report in the London Times last Thursday.
By coincidence, Director General John Birt was at Queen Margaret
Drive, the Glasgow HQ, on a routine visit on that day and, it is
understood, strenuous efforts were made to persuade him to think twice
about broadcasting the programme north of the Border. The Scottish
advice, obviously, fell on deaf ears.
BBC journalists in Scotland yesterday also referred to ''the arrogance
of senior London staff towards Scottish affairs and their ignorance of
Scottish politics''.
The revelation came hours after the BBC lost the third and it would
appear final round in that legal battle as three Scottish judges refused
the corporation leave to appeal to the House of Lords. The programme
makers wanted to overturn the granting of an interim interdict stopping
the showing of the programme until after polls close in Scotland's local
elections at 9pm tomorrow.
Lord Hope, Scotland's senior judge, supported by Lords Murray and
McCluskey, made it crystal clear that the important issues of principle
involved could not be decided in the current frenzied atmosphere, but
only after careful and detailed argument.
The judges stressed that at this early stage of the case, the House of
Lords would be in no better position than the Court of Session to make a
definitive ruling.
Mr Major said in Washington he had no regrets about giving the
interview. ''It is a matter for the BBC and for the courts,'' he said,
adding: ''I don't believe the subject of Scotland was raised in the
interview . . . That speaks for itself.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said afterwards: ''This has
been a waste of money and a waste of time. They have used a sledgehammer
to crack a nut. It is a major day for the Scottish legal system and a
blow in favour of balanced public service broadcasting and also for the
independence of the BBC.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace, said: ''Not only has
justice and fairness prevailed but common sense has won the day. The BBC
should have the humility to accept that they made a serious error of
judgment and learn from their mistakes. They must now recognise the
distinctive nature of the Scottish political dimension.''
This view found at least some sympathy at Queen Margaret Drive where
management and, in particular, the top ranking journalists are said to
be both embarrassed and angry at the way the London chiefs have dealt
with the affair. They feel cheated because it apparently never occurred
to Broadcasting House to consult them on this most delicate of matters.
However, it does not appear that there was any ''conspiracy theory''
on the part of London by failing to discuss the implications of the
programme with Scotland. It was, according to insiders, more of a simple
''cock-up''.
Nevertheless, the way it happened raises yet again serious questions
about the way London treats BBC Scotland.
The fear is that the row over Panorama is but a manifestation of the
sometimes scant regard which London gives to its Scottish region.
The NUJ chapel (office branch) of the BBC in Scotland yesterday held a
meeting during which it passed unanimously a motion ''regretting the
handling of the Panorama affair by BBC senior management''.
They went on to say: ''We believe it is an example of the arrogance of
senior London staff towards Scottish affairs and their ignorance of
Scottish politics. The chapel believes that the BBC should have admitted
its mistake and postponed the programme until after the local elections.
We now call on them to accept the decision of three of Scotland's most
senior judges and not pursue the matter any further.''
That would appear to be the BBC's intention on this matter at least,
but battle will rejoined on another front: the Scottish National Party's
petition to the court for a judicial review of the corporation's news
and current affairs output in Scotland.
The SNP said yesterday it would serve the writ for judicial review on
Mr Birt unless he apologised over the Panorama affair and gave
assurances for future coverage.
Party leader Alex Salmond said: ''Panorama was just an outstanding
example of how things can go very badly wrong. There is a much broader
issue of principle which needs to be addressed here.''
In a letter to Mr Birt, he said he had no quarrel with BBC Scotland,
but this accounted for only 10% of the BBC news and current affairs
output beamed into Scottish homes.
Executives at Queen Margaret Drive clearly believe they are on firmer
ground on the SNP issue. In a carefully worded statement Mr John
McCormack, Controller of BBC Scotland, said they would mount a rigorous
defence of their editorial freedom.
He said: ''It would be in no-one's interest if politicians went to the
courts on a case-by-case basis to try to change the content of
individual programmes.''
On Monday afternoon Lord Abernethy granted an interim interdict
banning the showing of the Major interview in Scotland until the local
election polls close at 9pm on Thursday.
The case against the BBC was brought by two election candidates, Mr
Pat Chalmers, the corporation's former controller in Scotland and Mr
Brian Houston. Mr Chalmers is standing for the Liberal Democrats in
Aberdeenshire and Mr Houston for Labour in Edinburgh.
Lord Abernethy ruled they had made out an arguable case that the BBC
would fail in its duty of impartiality by showing the Major interview so
close to the Scottish elections.
The BBC lodged an immediate appeal and minutes before Panorama was due
to go on air, Lords Hope, Murray and McCluskey, upheld the earlier
broadcasting ban.
Yesterday, before the same three judges, Mr James Taylor,
solicitor-advocate, for the BBC, asked for leave to take the case to the
House of Lords, a move opposed by Mr Andrew Hardie, QC, for the two
candidates.
Lord Hope said Lord Abernethy had been asked to consider whether the
candidates had made out an arguable case that the broadcast of the
interview with the Prime Minister was a breach of the BBC's licence
conditions to treat controversial subjects with due impartiality.
When the case came before the three judges on Monday evening, the BBC
had presented a different argument to the effect that Mr Chalmers and Mr
Houston had no title and interest to sue the corporation over the
conditions of the licence.
The case came before the court half an hour before the programme was
due to be broadcast and for obvious reasons, it was not possible for
that important issue to be debated in detail.
Lord Hope added: ''We were persuaded that a prima facie case had been
made out which was sufficient to justify the granting of interim
interdict. We were not asked, and we were not in a position to reach, a
final decision on the important issue of principle.''
He said it would not it be possible for the House of Lords to resolve
the matter in the time available. It ''would be in no better position
than we were to determine the issue''.
Scottish Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst accused opposition parties of
''whingeing like stuck pigs'' over the affair and said that those who
most often defended the BBC and attacked censorship had now resorted to
the law.

IN a hi-tech twist to the Panorama saga, the SNP claimed last night
the BBC had been guilty of a ''blatant breach'' of the interim interdict
banning the Major interview.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said the programme had been
screened last night on satellite television on BBC World, the BBC's
television world service, which, he said, can be picked up in Scotland.
Mr Russell said his party had alerted both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats. The SNP had a video tape recording of the broadcast, he said.
Mr Colin Baird, 25, a Scottish Office policy adviser, said he had
picked up the Panorama broadcast by accident whilst channel-hopping
using his #400 satellite receiver.
Mr Baird, a technology enthusiast, told The Herald last night he found
the interdicted programme running between 8pm and 9pm. He said a normal
Sky dish could pick it up by changing the dish position.
Mr Russell said it was ''a clear breach of an interim interdict handed
down by Scotland's highest court. The BBC Television World service is
called BBC World, but the BBC obviously don't regard Scotland as part of
the world.''
A BBC World spokesman insisted the output could be accessed only by
someone with specialist equipment and knowledge. The interdict had been
considered, the spokesman said, but it was felt it did not apply.

AN escaped prisoner who abducted a school cleaner and held her hostage
for six hours was yesterday given an additional 10-year jail sentence.
The High Court at Inverness heard that Miss Catherine Inkson feared
for her life throughout the ordeal, last June, which prompted one of the
biggest manhunts ever seen in the Highlands.
John Angus, 41, who was serving a five-year sentence for assault and
robbery at Greenock prison, had escaped a week earlier during a
recreational trip to a museum with five other low-risk prisoners.
The court heard he had robbed a building society in Aberdeen of #854,
after telling staff he had a gun, and repeated the offence at a building
society in Inverness, escaping with cheques worth #4825 and #860 in
cash.
Three days later he broke into Scotsburn Primary School, near Tain,
seeking shelter. When Miss Inkson, 40, walked into the school, he tied
her up and demanded her car keys.
Angus was surprised minutes later by the acting headteacher, Miss
Rhona Sim, 44, but he tied her to a chair, took her car keys and used
her car to drive off with Miss Inkson, whose hands were still bound
together.
He crashed the car in woods near-by, slightly injuring himself and his
hostage. At one point, he tied Miss Inkson to a tree, but set her free
at around 10.30pm, and she found her way to the nearest farm.
At the school, Miss Sim freed herself and raised the alarm, but Angus
initially managed to elude the police, who had brought in a helicopter
to help a 40-strong search team.
He was not found until 5.30pm the next day, hiding in a tunnel leading
from the former Invergordon aluminium smelter to the Cromarty Firth
jetty.
Advocate depute Mr Bill Totten told the court: ''It's plain that Miss
Inkson was fearful for her life from the point when she and the accused
left in the car.''
Miss Inkson was off work for more than three months after her
abduction, had problems going back to the school, and had to see a
psychologist, the court heard.
Defence advocate Mr Willie Thom said Angus's life had been hit by the
break-up of two relationships, which both had devastating effects on
him.
When his wife left him, Angus began offending. He then formed a
relationship with a woman while he was in prison, and learned that had
turned sour two days before he escaped.
Mr Thom said: ''This was a man for whom the emotional breakdown of a
second relationship was too much.''
He said that during Miss Inkson's abduction, Angus had repeatedly told
her she would not be hurt and his initial plan had been only to walk her
from the school and then leave her.
Angus, now a prisoner in Shotts, admitted abducting Miss Inkson on
June 10, and also assaulting Miss Sim by knocking her over, tying her to
a chair and robbing her.
He further admitted robbing a building society in Aberdeen on June 4,
another in Inverness two days later, and attempting to defeat justice by
escaping from Greenock Prison while on temporary leave on June 2.
Jailing him for 10 years, to start from his existing release date of
November 1997, Lord Johnston said Angus's victim must have suffered
appalling psychological stress.
Miss Inkson, of Kildary, near Tain, who also chairs the Scotsburn
school board, has refused to comment on the case without payment.
However, Mrs Carol Duff, the headteacher who was off sick at the time
of the incident, said: ''Cath kept a cool head in that moment of crisis
and it obviously paid dividends for her.
''She just kept on talking to him to keep him -- and herself -- calm
and eventually managed to persuade him to release her. She is a
remarkable woman and does a tremendous job for the school and the
community and is held in the highest regard by everyone.''

FOUR suspected members of the Irish National Liberation Army were
being held in Dublin yesterday following a massive police operation in
the north of the city.
More than 20 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition were seized
when police swooped on a car and a van on the main Dublin to Belfast
road.
Among the weapons seized were four assault rifles and 25 pistols.
The four men were seized under Ireland's counter insurgency laws.
Stun grenades were thrown by police to disorientate the men, who were
stopped at Balbridge near Balbriggan.
A large force of officers, backed by an Air Corps helicopter, had
tracked the vehicle heading north.
A police spokesman said: ''All four are believed to be members of the
INLA (Irish National Liberation Army). Firearms were recovered in both
vehicles.''
A witness said he saw police chase the men through fields after two
vehicles were intercepted
He added: ''I heard shots being fired. I thought at first it was a car
backfiring but then I realised it was shooting.''
The Irish Times reported that the authorities believed the INLA was
planning to destabilise the the peace process in Ulster by mounting
attacks.
The Gardai, the Irish police, have mounted a major operation codenamed
Operation Tara to contain criminal groups involved in robberies and drug
related crimes.
Several arrests have already been made by the task force.
The INLA is a small, ruthless, left-wing band which broke away from
the IRA.
It has not joined the peace process by declaring any ceasefire.

STEPHEN McGREGOR, Parliamentary Correspondent in Washington
PRESIDENT Clinton last night gave his strongest support so far to John
Major in his efforts to bring peace in Northern Ireland.
At a White House news conference, which took place after more than
three hours of talks, he paid a glowing tribute to Mr Major's courage
and made clear the importance of the IRA's giving up its weapons.
Mr Clinton said: ''I salute the Prime Minister for the tremendous
efforts he is making to bring an enduring peace to Northern Ireland. It
is closer to a lasting settlement than at any time in a generation, due
to the vision and courage of John Major.
''The joint Framework document is a landmark opportunity. The
paramilitaries on both sides must get rid of their weapons for good, so
that violence never returns to that island.''
Asked when direct talks should take place between British Ministers
and Sinn Fein, President Clinton said: ''It is a decision entirely for
the British Government to make in negotiations when ministerial talks
are appropriate.''
However, asked about the recent controversy over Gerry Adams's visit
to the US, the President told the news conference: ''I was very clear
when Mr Adams's visa was granted that there must be an agreement and
commitment in good faith seriously and quickly to discuss arms
decommissioning, because without that there will never be a resolution
in this conflict. We have to deal with this arms decommissioning
issue.''
Mr Major told the news conference: ''We have already started
discussions with loyalist paramilitaries, and we are seeking to have
exactly the same discussions with Sinn Fein.
''If Mr Adams is serious, he needs to discuss with the Government the
question of the modalities of decommissioning -- how it can be done,
when it can be done.
''Unless we can make progress on decommissioning there will be no
question of Sinn Fein sitting down with the other democratic political
parties in Northern Ireland.''
Both the President and the Prime Minister acknowledged that there had
been a disagreement over the Adams visit, but both said their
relationship was sufficiently strong to withstand an occasional fall
out.''
Mr Major has made a point during his visit of making clear to the
Americans that the IRA still has not moved far enough on decommissioning
of weapons, and has given graphic descriptions of what punishment
beatings actually mean.
In a series of later interviews, Mr Major said he hoped Sinn Fein
would enter talks on decommissioning in the near future.
''There is a general expectation, not just here in the US but
everywhere else, that Sinn Fein will now come under a clear obligation
to enter into discussions on the decommissioning of their weapons,'' he
said.
''We have made a great deal of progress in the process towards peace.
We have had a ceasefire for some months and we need to turn that into
lasting peace.
''The most immediate hurdle is to commence and complete, with both
loyalist paramilitaries and Sinn Fein, the discussions about how we
decommission arms.''
Mr Major said the words used to describe the nature of the
relationship between the US and Britain were a ''matter of irrelevance''
to him.
''It is not just a matter of importance, it is imperative for western
Europe generally and specifically for the United Kingdom to maintain
that very close relationship with the United States,'' he said.
''I can't see that relationship changing or fracturing. It is too
deep, it is too deeply entrenched and I believe it will stay deeply
entrenched.''
Asked if he counted Mr Clinton as a friend, he smiled and said: ''We
have a very good relationship. He is a good friend.''
Earlier, Mr Major held talks with Vice President Al Gore and Mr Newt
Gingrich, the House of Representatives' Speaker and leader of the
right-wing Republican revolution in the States.
Asked earlier if he would be offering tips to the Prime Minister on
winning elections, Mr Gingrich said: ''We in many ways designed our
campaigns on his successful campaigns and those of Mrs Thatcher.''

HOW better to impress your bank manager than by buying the house that
was built for a bank governor? Beechmount House in Edinburgh's douce
Corstophine is on the market.
Standing in eight acres of attractive sloping grounds, it was built
originally as a private home for the governor of the Bank of Scotland
just over 90 years ago.
Architect John Watson chose an Italianate style for the splendid
setting on Corstophine Hill, looking southward over the city skyline
towards the Pentlands and to the east towards the Castle.
The property was used as a convalescent home until four years ago and
was then used as offices. The agents says that it offers considerable
scope for residential use, or for commercial purposes as a private
hotel, business centre or institutional use - subject to planning
consent.
John Brown of selling agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe says: ''We expect
considerable interest in Beechmount as it is one of the most attractive
houses in Edinburgh.''
Since he is inviting offers over #650,000 it might be that only bank
governors (or bank robbers) need apply.

<HEADLINE>Businessman pays #1m to become Rangers superfan</HEADLINE>

AN Edinburgh businessman has paid an estimated #1m to become the first
of a new breed of superfan willing to commit large sums of money to be
part of the football club he supports.
Mr Ian Russell was appointed an associate director of Rangers Football
Club yesterday. His new position carries no voting rights or boardroom
powers. Instead he will form part of a think tank at the Ibrox club.
Over the next 18 months, Rangers hope to create a maximum of four more
associate directors, boosting the club's finances by around #4m. The
appointments are expected to be for fixed terms of up to five years and
the prospect of holders moving on to full directorships has not been
ruled out.
Rangers' chairman, Mr David Murray, described the title as an honorary
one, but added it was an important role which carried a wide range of
benefits.
''It is one step below board level,'' he said. ''It is another form of
sponsorship. Associate directors will be a sounding board for the
directors -- these are Rangers' people and they can give us their
thoughts.''
Mr Murray said new sources of income were vital if Rangers were to
fully compete on the international football scene. He confirmed talks
were taking place with other potential associate directors.
He said: ''We have been speaking to two or three individuals who will
put some money into the club.''
Mr Russell, 41, a life-long Rangers supporter, will initially hold his
new position for five years.
He said: ''We have been sponsors at Ibrox for five or six years and
done business with them for over 20 years. When the invitation came I
was delighted to take it up.''
He added that, as well as access to all the club's commercial
activities, his new position would have a commercial spin-off for his
companies.
''It wouldn't make sense otherwise,'' he said. ''This is a
non-executive, honorary position. And there is no point in doing it for
personal satisfaction.
''One of our companies is a leisure company in Edinburgh operating
throughout central Scotland. We are involved with children's leisure and
family leisure. David Murray's commitment is to try and make Ibrox
Stadium a seven day-a-week operation and we would hope to become
involved in that.''
* A #2m plan by the club to fill two vacant areas at Ibrox Stadium was
approved by Glasgow City councillors yesterday, writes John MacCalman.
The corner areas of the Copland Road/Govan Road stands and the Govan
Road/ Broomloan Road stands will accommodate video display screens and
provide an additional 1188 seats.
Rangers also plan to form paved access areas, provide 240 additional
off-street car parking places and improve traffic access arrangements
off Broomloan Road.

MILKMEN, mechanics, hairdressers . . .even chartered accountants and
solicitors are among those who would love to be seen in a crystal ball
as winners of the National Lottery.
However, any astrologers or psychics wanting to sell lottery
predictions to the public might first want to look closely at their own
future.
It doesn't augur well when you consider the case of a man in the US
who is suing a palm reader for more than #2m, claiming she sold him the
wrong numbers.
Mr Warren Smith wants Lola Rose Miller, also known as Miss Stella, to
pay him the amount of the jackpot he claims he would have won.
Ms Miller is currently serving a one-year prison sentence for cheating
customers who came to her business in Roanoke, Virginia, seeking advice.
The judge ordered her to pay back #12,000 to the customers she
defrauded. Mr Smith says he lost more than #50,000 over five months last
year.
According to the lawsuit filed earlier this week, Ms Miller told Mr
Smith that she had gone to church and God had given her the numbers, and
that the numbers would win. Later she said he did not win because one of
his family members had placed a curse on him, the lawsuit goes on.
The lawsuit claims that over five months, she persuaded Mr Smith to
give her almost all of his available money, including #20,000 he
withdrew from his retirement account.
In addition to the #2m lottery jackpot, the lawsuit seeks #230,000 in
punitive damages and to recover Mr Smith's losses.
Ms Miller was arrested last year after telling an undercover police
officer she could end the woman's marital problems by removing an evil
spirit in the form of a potato growing inside her body.
All the woman had to do was come back with a glass of water, a dirty
sock, and $1200. Police returned and arrested Ms Miller on charges of
obtaining money by false pretenses.
If British forecasters still want to go ahead, they are well warned.
Lottery punters have a one in 14,900,000 chance of winning the UK
jackpot, according to experts.
