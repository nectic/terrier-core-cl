STEWART Milne Homes has opened the doors to a new show home at the
Laurels in Newtonhill, by Aberdeen.
The three-bedroom semi-detached Sumburgh show home has been designed
with young families in mind, with bright, colourful colours
complementing a deep jade carpet use throughout.
Downstairs, vibrant fabrics in lemon, aqua, and blue feature in
curtains and upholstery, contrasting with plain magnolia walls and pale
oak furniture.
Divisional director Donald McInnes says:''There are currently several
house styles available at the Laurels ranging from the two and
three-bedroom Souter, Bennane, and Garroch bungalows to the
three-bedroom Abbey and Sumburgh villas and the larger, four-bedroom
Durston villa.''
''All are built to a high specification with full gas central heating,
double glazing, fitted kitchen, and fitted wardrobes to most bedrooms.
The larger homes also benefit from en suite facilities and garages.
''Well-served by local shops, community centre, schools, and bus
service and close to the bustling market town of Stonehaven and
Aberdeen, they provide ideal family homes. And with prices starting from
just #62,950 they represent good value for money when compared to city
centre properties.''
The Sumburgh villa has been decorated by ID Interiors.

A leading Scottish house builder has endorsed a new wet electric
heating system. Apart from its heating qualities, CALA Homes was
attracted to the Dualheat boiler because of the ease with which it can
be installed almost anywhere in the home, including airing cupboards. It
has no requirements for a flue or an outside storage tank.
The system has been developed by Redring Electric of Peterborough in
conjunction with ScottishPower.
Two years ago CALA Homes became the first UK house building company to
test the product.
Dualheat boilers were incorporated into a block of 18 flats in the
company's #4.8 million Annfield Gardens development in Stirling.
The 'experiment' was so successful that the company are repeating it
by incorporating the Dualheat system into another 13 flats in a
development in the upmarket Merchiston area of Edinburgh.
As a house building company, CALA had been actively looking for a wet
electric central heating system suitable for use in their houses for a
number of years as an alternative option fore customers. But, says the
company, nothing fitted the bill until the
development of Dualheat.
The new system uses a sophisticated boiler which provides domestic hot
water and uses conventional water-filled radiators to provide central
heating.
The 18 flats in Annfield Gardens - one and two bedrooms ranging from
#50,000 to #70,000 in price - went on sale in March 1994 and were sold
out by July.
CALA design director John Curtis said: 'The attraction of Dualheat is
that it can fit in with the standard radiators used for any central
heating system. It is not obtrusive.''
Dualheat, which has been fully approved by the British Board of
Agrement (BBA) and the British Electrical Approved Board (BEAB), can
heat a full radiator system in less than five minutes.
The prototypes of the Dualheat boiler was invented by George Hepburn
of Weathershield (Scotland)Ltd. ScottishPower was instrumental in
bringing together Mr Hepburn's prototype boiler and expertise of Redring
Electric to create the final product.
Redring, which is jointly owned by GEC and General Electric of
America, put the prototype through extensive testing in its
laboratories. In the last two years, Dualheat has been test marketed in
400 family homes.

AVONSIDE is proud of its Westward Rise housing development in
Bearsden. It is an exclusive estate, but convenient - with Glasgow's
city centre and the countryside both around 15 minutes away - and is
able to provide a range of five new house styles.
Altogether, what the company are pleased to describe as their ''finest
ever'' development will consist of a total of 39 three and four-bedroom
detached homes. Prices range from #157,500 to #202,250.
The houses are all being built to a split-level design, with two and
occasionally three floors. This gives excellent views around, from what
the development's title indicates is a hillside or raised location.
The development is in the popular, and rather prestigious, North
Baljaffray area,and is now around the halfway-completed stage. There is
what the developers are also pleased to describe as a ''steady flow'' of
interested visitors, with several properties already occupied.
An additional showhouse should be ready for viewing, or occupation, of
course, in June. This one will be the luxury Ptarmigan.
As indications of the designs available, there is the Swallow. This
one starts at #165,500 for a three-bedroom detached property. There is a
25ft 6in by 13ft 9in lounge, plus living room, dining room, study,
utility room and cloakroom.
The Jay and Tern, both with four bedrooms, start at #178,750 and
#167,500 respectively. Both include lounge, dining room, utility room
and store room, plus a gallery. In addition, the Tern has a sunken
dressing room in its master bedroom.
With the Heron property, there are four bedrooms, lounge, dining room,
utility room and study on offer. Prices for this particular design start
at #170,500.
Top of the range is the Ptarmigan. This is priced from #202,250. It is
a property with four bedrooms, lounge, living room, dining room, utility
room and cloakroom, with a large balcony to the front elevation.
With the properties all built on spacious lots, this ensures ample
garden area. There are also double garages, paviour driveways, and front
gardens which are turfed. Interiors feature high quality hardwood finish
to doors, windows, skirting boards and ba lustrades.
Master bedrooms have en suite facilities throughout the properties,
and there are mirror doors in most of the additional bedrooms at
Westward Rise.
Bob Gillespie, Avonside MD, comments: ''This development is a clear
demonstration of our sincere commitment to excellence. I believe that
our new house styles are a superb illustration of our architectural
flexibility, which allows us to adapt our designs to suit the
surrounding environment as well as catering to individual tastes.
''We are delighted with the level of interest which has been generated
by this development, and attribute it to the immense individuality and
quality of the homes and their excellent location.''
One of the benefits of this particular development is that it has a
good range of facilities at hand. These include schools, shopping
complexes and leisure outlets. Bearsden and neighbouring Milngavie are,
in fact, a joint district at present, with good transport facilities to
and from town.
Visitors can see the overall situation for themselves in the
four-bedroom properties at the show complex.  The complex is open for
inspecton from Thursday to Monday, 11am to 5.30pm.

WHY buy a large zircon, when for the same price you can buy a small
but genuine diamond? Three years ago, this eminently sensible principle
guided Ian Hunter to his delightful home tucked away at 50 Fortrose
street in Glasgow's West End. He describes this former coach house as
''bijoux'' and it certainly has all the charm of an antique jewel box.
But in Ian's case diamonds are not forever, and he has decided with
some reluctance that the time has come to find somewhere larger.
One of the real advantages to the mews is its situation. While it is
part of a large villa now divided into flats, the coach house is
completely detached, with a paved drive running up to the door and a
pebble covered frontage where Ian keeps his pots of plants. An original
ornate ironwork lamp marks his entrance between two old stone gate
posts.
''This is one of the oldest properties in the area, but when I bought
the mews it had been gutted and taken right back to the shell so that
everything was brand new. Nothing here is older than a couple of years,
including the plumbing, the heating and the wiring. It had all the
advantages of a new building with the character of an old property.''
Inside, the mews has been skilfully designed to make the most of the
space available. A small vestibule has been created where Ian's
beautiful marble-topped side table stands with a lamp and a carved stone
head he found in Suffolk.
Beyond is the bathroom with its white tiling and white suite behind a
natural wood door. A frieze of modern navy and white tiles matches the
blue patterned shower curtain.
The kitchen next door is cream and the units are trimmed in natural
wood. An extension to the worktop creates a small dining table with room
for two chairs on either side. There is also enough room for Ian's
stripped pine chest of drawers along one wall.
Adjoining the kitchen is a large utility cupboard where the ironing
board and other essentials are hidden away.
Two stairs lead up to the sitting room which is full of interest. The
large double glazed windows on one side make it very light, while
overhead the ceiling is vaulted with the beams left exposed. Two windows
extend outwards to a point almost forming an old fashioned
''sitooterie'' with a large varnished pine sill.
Ian has chosen the colours and furnishings for the house with obvious
care and has avoided cramming too many pieces of furniture into the
room. Instead, the clever design can be enjoyed without distraction. The
pale creamy yellow paint is warm and elegant, while the beige carpet is
a neutral partner.
The open timber stairs lead up from the sitting room to a raised level
which forms the bedroom. With plenty of space for a double bed and a
bedside desk, nothing is cramped. A large fitted cupboard with glass
doors extends along one wall allowing for storage.
Throughout the mews there are downlighters in the ceilings with useful
dimmer switches, while the central heating is on White Meter.
The well-kept grounds of the house are shared and Ian admits that in
summer he spends much of his time outside. Steps lead up to a tree-edged
lawn and there is even a small orchard beyond. To the front of the house
there is plenty of room to park on the paved forecourt.
From his south-facing windows he has a view over the West of Scotland
Cricket Club ground, making this detached cottage in a  favourite area
of the city a rare gem indeed.

HERE'S a fairly unusual property that has come on to the market. It's
a penthouse flat, Right at the top of the Italian Centre in Glasgow's
Merchant City.
The balcony overlooks the Centre's piazza. There is a decent-sized
lounge, leading on to patio doors, and the study is on the mezzanine
level.
Invite some friends for a Campari and soda, or continue with the
computer spreadsheets instead? Live it up, or get on with making a
fortune?
Either way, this particular pied a terre comes with dining room, two
double bedrooms, bathroom with electric shower, and a fully-fitted
kitchen. Appliances include a dishwasher.
There is a video-controlled entry system, and it's all luxuriously
fitted throughout. Private parking is an optional extra. Yours for #1000
a month.
And yes, says Lyn Sher of Lets Rent Property Bureau, you don't get too
many of these coming along. Rather special to have one of this kind of
popular flat for rent, as opposed to simply being offered for sale.
Going down the price scale just a little bit, could mean moving out to
Lochwinnoch, say, where you can rent a traditional Victorian-style
detached townhouse. It has two public rooms, three double bedrooms,
boxroom, two bathrooms, large breakfasting kitchen, gas-fired central
heating, garage and a nice big secluded back garden. All for #800 a
month.
If you prefer, you can for the style of life in Gartmore at the the
same price. You get a modern three-bedroom detached villa this time,
with three public rooms, three double bedrooms, large fully fitted
kitchen, double garage, double glazing, gas-fired central heating, and
large gardens all round. A nice country property.
Dullatur, perhaps? If a modern detached chalet villa is what you are
after, this one has great panoramic views from the lounge. There are two
public rooms, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a large dining kitchen,
gas-fired central heating, double glazing, and nice secluded gardens. It
comes in at #750 a month.
It could be, of course, that you prefer to settle down just that bit
farther away from the city centre. Somewhere like Aberfoyle, where there
is a recently refurbished detached bungalow available, with lots of
character.
It comes with two public rooms, three double bedrooms, two bathrooms,
a new fitted kitchen, garage, solid fuel central heating this time, and
a large private garden.
And if you're interested, there are fishing rights in the local water.
Try #700 a month.
There's never any real limit to the variety of properties available
these days. Flats or houses are both on the market. Just to prove the
case, look at Glasgow's popular Waterfront.
Here you find a modern top floor executive flat offering a public
room, three bedrooms with one en suite, bathroom, large lounge, fully
fitted kitchen, double glazing, and security entry, all at #650 a month.

THE Easter weekend is a popular time to go house-hunting, but as far
as the kids are concerned it can become a dreary trek round show house
after show house. Tired children, traffic jams, and the pressure to make
a decision can ruin the day.
But Sandhaven Homes in Dunoon believes it has the answer. Families
visiting the company's final show house will find entertainment laid on
for the children.
''The idea is to turn the trip to Dunoon into an exciting, thoroughly
enjoyable day out for all the family,'' said Lorna Stewart of Sandhaven
Homes. ''There will be music, a creche, soft play area, bouncy castle,
lucky dips, and refreshments. There will also be a welcome pack
outlining events and attractions around Dunoon during the Easter
weekend.''
Some 20 homes remain unsold on the estate, including four new
bungalows. To encourage reservations over the Easter weekend Sandhaven
is including a three-day family holiday break at the nearby Hafton House
holiday centre for purchasers.

WHEN brothers Duncan and Jack Ogilvie first pushed their wheelbarrow
on to a building site they probably did not realise that their firm
would enter the big league of independent Scottish builders.
Founded in 1946, the firm earned #2000 in that first year. Now the
Stirling-based Ogilvie Group has a turnover of #50m, provides jobs for
some 600 people, and almost 60% of its #50m per annum turnover comes
from its construction and development arm.
Nine years ago Ogilvie Homes was set up to provide the leading edge of
the group's house-building interests -- with all construction carried
out by Ogilvie Builders, another arm of the firm. The strategy has been
successful, propelling Ogilvie Homes into one of Scotland's top 10 house
builders within a decade.
This year the company's sales target is 160 units at an average
selling price of #75,000. This represents a conscious change of gearing
from the 1994 average of #82,000 and is in response to a clearly
perceived shift in new home-buying patterns.
By next year Ogilvie Homes is expected to be producing around 200
units per annum with a more even spread of developments throughout
Central Scotland. The products will range from the 44 homes nestling in
the listed Old Gardens of Newbattle Abbey by Dalkeith, at prices up to
#250,000, to the #50,000 flats at Anniesland in the West End of Glasgow.
In all, some 300 units and plots are currently in the planning process
and a further 500 units and plots are on-stream. Significantly, the
majority of these are scheduled on brownfield sites.
In 1994, Hazel Rore joined Ogilvie Homes as sales and marketing
manager, bringing her experience earned with some of Scotland's leading
volume house builders. In the space of 12 months, Hazel has restructured
the sales and marketing function of the company and improved its speed
of reaction to market changes.
She sees ''management for change'' as being as important for the
house-building industry as for any other large manufacturing sector.
Managing director David Ross is cautiously introducing new talent to
the company while maintaining a lean, cost-effective operation which he
hopes will eventually be reflected in the crucial profit per employee
statistic.
Orchestrated by David Ross in conjunction with Hazel Rore in sales and
marketing, the strategy for the company involves a lifting of its
profile as new sites are developed further from its Central Scotland
heartland and a tactical land acquisition plan which will move the
company into the mainstream of Scotland's population.
The ability of the company to develop successfully and profitably
small pockets of land with as few as 12 units is allied to the ability
to achieve above average cash flows in the early stage of the site
development.
At the recently released Ridgemont development on Slamannan Road,
Falkirk local pressure from home buyers enabled 50% of the units
available to be sold on the day sales commenced, generating income in
excess of #1m.

Easter weekend sees Bellway Homes open a show house at its Oak Bank,
Airdrie development, Started in September, where 24 houses have been
sold to date.
Homes there start from two-bedroomed mid-terraced properties at just
over #50,000 up to four-bedroom detached houses with utility room,
downstairs cloakroom with WC and basin, Integral garage, master bedroom
with en suite, double glazing and gas central heating, priced from
#85,000-#87,000, depending on plot size.
Sales manager Iain Davidson reports: ''We are currently building from
Old Kilpatrick in the west, through to Blantyre and Airdrie in the east.
Hopefully, subject to planning permission later this month, we will be
building, two, three and four bedroomed houses on a site in Edinburgh.''
Bellway's Urban Renewal schemes have been selling steadily. At
Springwells, Blantyre, a small council estate currently being
refurbished, offers two bedroomed double glazed flats with gas central
heating, for around #34,750, and has met with strong interest. ''It is
good value and allows people to get onto the first rung of the property
owning ladder,'' says Mr Davidson.
Similar schemes at Garthamlock and Drumchapel, he explained, have met
with the same interest.
''A lot of people are saying that confidence is only there if there's
price growth. While that's true, the reality is also that if it's
pitched at the right price, we'll also get the turnover, so we're
selling houses to people at the right end of the market, if you like.''

Following a ''significant' local demand, Miller Homes has commenced
new building work at Dalnottar Park, Old Kilpatrick, on the north bank
of the Clyde.In all, 30 detached three and four bedrooms homes are
planned for this new development and six different house styles will be
available.
Lindsay Gilchrist, sales manager for Miller Homes in the West of
Scotland said: ''Old Kilpatrick is well known to Miller Homes. We
completed our Antonine Park development, which is just a short distance
from here, only a few months ago.
During construction we were flattered with the number of enquiries we
had asking us to provide more quality housing in this area and Dalnottar
Park should help meet that demand.
Our research showed a requirement for more detached homes in the area
and potential buyers should be pleased that all the 30 homes planned for
here are detached.
Meanwhile, Miller Homes ,iller Homes hasef enquiries we started
building work at ''Kilspindie Gardens', development of 21 new homes at
School Road, Aberlady, in East Lothian.
David Brown, sales manager for Miller Homes in the East of Scotland,
said: ''our development at Fishers Meadow at Port Seton has been a star
performer this year and the market knowledge we have gained from our
presence there has proved very useful for our new development at
Aberlady.
The development itself will have only 21 homes in total, 19 of which
are detached three and four bedroom homes. In all, there will be five
different house styles.
MILLER Homes recorded outstanding sales figures for 1994, and the
trend looks set to continue through 1995.
The company's early predictions for this year are already proving to
be correct with ''above average'' sales already taken for the first
three months of 1995 despite a fairly flat housing market.
Deborah Benson, sales and marketing director, said: ''Miller is
looking forward very positively to the remainder of 1995. There is no
doubt we had an exceptional year in 1994 -- almost 50% more people moved
into a new Miller home in 1994 compared with 1993 -- and already 1995 is
looking good.''
Sales momentum is running high, helped in part by the opening of new
developments at Aberlady in East Lothian, Dalnottar Park at Old
Kilpatrick, and Regal Court in Paisley's Renfrew Road.
'' These new developments mean that Miller Homes can now offer
purchasers a choice of 16 prime locations across Central Scotland,''
says Deborah Benson.

AN innovative marketing scheme will tout Scottish homes through
Internet to buyers all over the world. More than two million potential
customers will be able to ''tour'' the houses from their desktops,
viewing pictures and reading detailed descriptions of features and
amenities.
Maggie Husband, property sales manager for Lindsays, Edinburgh, will
put six homes from Edinburgh, Perthshire and the Borders on to the net
as test cases next week. Linked offices in the Far East, Mid East and
America will feature the homes on screen in their showrooms and computer
users will be able to call up the descriptions from their offices and
homes.
Tours of another dozen homes are already being prepared and Ms Husband
plans to make electronic marketing a standard part of her firm's
services. ''I think it is a very innovative and exciting way to increase
the number of potential buyers for certain homes,'' she says, ''and it
will be a very useful selling tool for us.
''We have already had considerable success selling homes abroad by
traditional advertising methods and by linking up with international
companies' personnel departments. We've moved houses through the South
China Morning Post that had stuck in the Edinburgh market. The Internet
makes international selling much easier and more cost-effective for both
buyer and owner.
''I think it will be most effective for selling investment and
executive homes. International buyers want to see flats and homes priced
above #100,000 in areas where letting is popular. For them, this kind of
service is ideal. They will be able to narrow their options from home
and concentrate only on the most likely properties when they visit
Scotland. The age-old problem of explaining to internationals that you
can't drive from Peebles to Aberdeen in 20 minutes will no doubt
continue, but all the important information about a house can be
communicated over the net.
''For first-time buys we think Internet marketing is probably less
appropriate. Those target buyers don't need computer help to find a
flat. And in the really popular areas -- say a stone house on a good
street in Morningside -- the market's just too hot: the house will be
sold before an international has time to phone in his interest.
''Almost all of the likely buyers for up-market Scottish homes are
familiar with the Internet already. Hong Kong returnees are obviously
big at the moment but there is also a good market of investors in the
Far East who are used to doing busines electronically.
''Americans and particularly American companies are miles ahead at
this sort of thing and are very ready to accept house hunting over the
Internet. Flat buying for students is always very heavy in the summer
months and more and more of them go to internationals. If a student here
can use the Internet to show a flat to his or her parents in Japan,
America or Italy, think how much easier it will be for them to buy.
''Britain's estate agents have been too slow to pick up on new
technology -- we risk becoming a backwater. This is the way forward and
I think it will pay to be the first on the path.''
Information on the properties will be distributed through the Internet
by Somerset-based Prestige British Properties International, who have
set up a network of wired-up showrooms around the globe. Partner Peter
Callaghan says flexibility and convenience are the system's two main
selling points: ''Let's say all you know about property in Edinburgh is
that you need one. You can take a tour of the area's homes by specifying
price range, whether you'd like to live in the city or outside in the
country, the number of bedrooms you need... anything.
''The computer will do the work of finding appropriate properties and
you can give them the once-over from home. You don't need to spend hours
on overseas phone lines calling a dozen different estate agents asking
if they have anything suitable.
''If you have particular wishes, like an Aga or a stable, you just add
them to the list. It's as easy as that.
''Cities like Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen are obviously top
candidates for this kind of selling. They all have lots of really
desirable homes and a significant population of internationals.
Personnel departments and relocation agents are always desperate for
more sources of information. Anything that combines pictures and text in
an easy to use format is going to go over well.''

Frills are a thing of the past, says Margarete Stewart.
OLD designs can be used in new houses, claims a leading interior
designer. It is far more attractive, not to mention easier, to
incorporate traditional classical features in a new home than to use
modern styles in a traditional home, according to Beazer Homes's
designer Margarete Stewart.
The former window display designer is known for her use of bold
colours and elaborate decorative extras in many of the company's show
homes and is a firm advocate of the ''bold is best'' approach to
interior design.
''Frills are a thing of the past. Cords, braids, tassels, and pelmets
are all back and while they can be costly, it pays to shop around as
good bargains are to be found. Checks, stripes, and florals are also
very useable if selected carefully, and can even be mixed.''
In floor coverings Margarete favours the plainer self-coloured carpet
but stresses that the colour should not dictate the overall style of the
room. ''Having a green carpet does not rule out the possibility of a
pink room.''
And while polished wooden floors are currently very popular, she
avoids featuring them in the Beazer show homes: ''Polished wooden floors
may be very attractive and fashionable but they are simply not practical
for the volumes of traffic in a show house. A similar effect can be
achieved by using decorative rugs on top of self-coloured carpets.''
One of Margarete's latest completed design projects is the range of
show homes at the Beazer development at Glenellen Park in Edinburgh. She
is now working on the Regent's Park show homes in Glasgow's
Thornliebank, which will be ready for the Easter weekend.
Meanwhile the company claims a ''tremendous reaction'' to its new
Springbank Gardens development in East Kilbride.
The 156-home development is the company's seventh in the area and has
attracted scores of inquiries and visitors and a number of reservations
since opening on March 11.
Sales director Maureen Anderson said: ''Springbank Gardens will
feature a variety of two, three, and four-bedroom homes in terraced,
semi-detached, and detached forms priced between #54,495 and #108,495.
We believe this across-the-board range of homes is integral to the
site's success and the second phase will also introduce a range of one
and two-bedroom flats.''
Show houses for Springbank Gardens are expected to be ready in the
summer and will include the Melrose three-bedroom semi-detached and the
Ettrick three-bedroom semi-detached with garage.

FEW builders these days find demand for their developments so great
that potential buyers are prepared to queue through the night, to take
options on properties.
But that's just what happened recently when McCarthy &amp; Stone started
marketing The Cedars, 36 retirement apartments currently still under
construction at Corstorphine, Edinburgh. The site, at the corner of
Manse Road and St John's Road, was formerly occupied by a doctor's house
and surgery with a smaller house in the grounds.
The one and two-bedroomed apartments have a price range of #65,000 to
#80,000, and #80,000 to #95,000 respectively. To date, options have been
taken on 35 of the 36. The completed apartments will be released monthly
from May.
In a conservation area in the heart of Corstorphine with its excellent
shopping and amenities, the attractive, sympathetically designed
development will have a resident house manager, residents' lounge, guest
suite, laundry and emergency call and fire alarm system linked to a
central monitoring centre. With the emphasis on security, The Cedars
will have a video entryphone system, and each flat will be fitted with
an intruder alarm.
McCarthy &amp; Stone marketing manager, Vivien Threadgould, said:
''Because of the huge interest, we decided to offer options off-plan. We
used a local hotel as our base, instead of our normal route of waiting
till a showflat was ready, then taking sales reservations.''
She describes as ''incredible'' the response which saw people booking
into the hotel overnight, with dozens more gathered outside, some of
whom had started queueing during the night.
McCarthy &amp; Stone's Scottish regional managing director, Alan Gosland,
said: ''Our research shows there are very few opportunities in Scotland
generally, for purpose-built properties where retired people can live in
comfort and security.''

TAY HOMES has released a further 14 homes at Hyndland Gate, the
company's development in Glasgow's West End. Three styles of flat are
available for sale at the development, which is situated off Hyndland
Road beside Hillhead Rugby Club.
The two-bedroom Turnberry and Clarence are priced from #96,500 and
#108,000 respectively, and the three bedroom Devonshire is priced from
#114,750.
Iain Stewart, sale director, Tay Homes, said: ''The properties allow
owners to enjoy all the benefits of living in one of the most sought
after areas in Glasgow and have already proved attractive to a wide
range for people.''
The flats at Hyndland Gate include fitted carpets as part of the
buyers package. Tay Homes are also offering a two-year fixed mortgage of
3.9% to the end of February 1997.
Meanwhile, Tay is poised to start its second new homes development in
the Edinburgh area following the success of the company's first venture
into the capital.
Bramley Park, at Newcraighall, is currently in its final phase with
only a handful of homes remaining for sale, including the three bedroom
detached showhome, priced at #89,950.
The showhome buyers package includes fully fitted carpets, curtains,
soft furnishings, washing machine, integral fridge, an alarm system and
a double garage.
In just 18 months more than 80 properties have been sold and Tay Homes
expects that success to carry over into further Edinburgh developments.
Sales director Iain Stewart says: ''While it is important to ensure
that the property and location are carefully selected, we also offer a
comprehensive range of value added items for new home buyers.''
These include the company's House Warming package which offers free
options such as fitted carpets, landscaping, gas fire and hearth, or
free furniture.
''We also cater for all types of new home buyer. Benefits include the
option of a part-exchange of ''back-stop' deal, a fixed-rate mortgage,
#250 move-in scheme, first-time buyers' package, free redundancy
protection and a NHBC guarantee,'' says Iain Stewart .

THIS exhibition represents the first British venue for an
extraordinary collection of modern tribal photographic art. The prime
focus of the exhibition is one of aboriginal reclamation and cultural
imbalance of the United States. Jesse Cooday, one of the curators/
artists, is a native American based in New York who plays an active role
for the native landless communities.
For the participating artists this Scottish venue is highly
significant. The affinity of native clans and oppressed birthright echo
a very Scottish social scenario.
In terms of image-making, the Indian nations have had to adapt in
order to communicate their frustrations fluently. Digital imaging and
film and video installations sit convincingly beside the more
conventional reportage. Ron Carraher makes delicate photographs of icons
and artefacts which become monumental in their own right.
The lingering misrepresentations of historic photographers and
''cowboys and injuns'' of Hollywood have left a dark cloud which is
slowly dispersing from above the native community. In the classical
frontier westerns of John Ford and Cecil B Demille the ''injun'' was
often utilised as a fictional scapegoat for domestic American problems
since the Civil War. The patriotic American stereotype is featured in
the satirical photo silk screen triptych of Jesse Cooday Wayne's World
refers to the greatest cowboy of them all, layered onto the colours of
the Pacific North West mask. The other two male icons are Marlborough
Man and Christopher Columbus. Cooday himself responds with ''Columbus
didn't discover us, we discovered him.'' For many of us our own distant
illusions deserve to be reinformed by this most refreshing exhibition.

Alexander Black on the problems of challenging developments such as
the M77 and Skye Bridge
WHILE a distance of less than 100ft now separates the two sections of
the #25m Skye Bridge, due to be officially opened this Autumn,
controversy continues to rage over the building of the M77 motorway into
Glasgow.
Both cases highlight the barriers placed in the way of those who wish
to mount a meaningful legal challenge against developments of this kind,
which have a massive impact on the environment.
A procedure known as environmental impact assessment (EIA) is supposed
to provide the framework for a proper and balanced consideration of
projects like the Skye Bridge and the M77.
But EIA is expensive and time-consuming, and was reluctantly accepted
by the UK after more than 10 years of discussion and 20 drafts of an EU
directive.
As the continued opposition to the Skye Bridge and the extension of
the A77 shows, the system has conspicuously failed to ease environmental
conflict.
The A77 is the main Glasgow/Kilmarnock/Ayr trunk road and, according
to chartered surveyors, certain property values could be substantially
increased following construction of the new M77. While vested interest
groups have strong arguments in favour of the project, those in
opposition are not as well organised.
The Secretary of State approved the A77 scheme in September 1989
without submitting the project to an EIA under the European Directive,
which came into force in July 1988. Because the A77 upgrade has been
mooted for such a long time, the legal issue concerns the time when the
project was ''initiated''.
Environmentalists of all types continue to face a legal system that is
hostile to public-interest litigation and more comfortable with
conventional planning law. Until recently, EIA has failed because only a
dozen court cases have been heard without strong appellate level
guidelines. Rather than rely on the courts, the European Commission may
have to put teeth in EIA law.
Nevertheless, a group of environmental activists, led by Veronica
Stevens, is continuing the legal battle against the Skye Bridge and,
while it may be too late to stop construction, it's not too late to
receive damages.
The bridge is being built under legislation that enables private
enterprise to finance and construct roads, traditionally the
responsibility of government. But the project threatens coastal otters,
which are an endangered species protected by a murky mixture of
international, European and British law.
Stevens contends that the Skye Bridge EIA failed to provide objectors
with a meaningful forum to challenge Government-sponsored development
which affects a sustainable environment. Individuals who oppose
large-scale public projects should be allowed to intervene in an
efficient legal process and public-interest litigation generally needs a
streamlined process, guaranteeing faster and less expensive access to
the courts.
Veronica Stevens attempted to challenge the substantive merits of the
EIA and was prevented from doing so by procedural skirmishing, court
costs, and an abuse of Government discretion.
Her challenge also stalled in the Court of Session because of an
inequality of information. The Government and the bridge developer,
Miller/Dywidag, possessed virtually all the information, including the
confidential contract for construction of the bridge.
Justice was not done when it failed to address her concerns about
''The Skye Crossing: Environmental Statement'', an extensive document
discussing site analysis, ownership, geological survey, existing
vegetation, marine chart, soil survey etc.
Stevens is now pursuing the matter politically in the European
Parliament Committee of Petitions and intends to raise an action in the
European Court of Justice. Hers is an important test case which concerns
access to Government information. The price of the EIA document was a
staggering #175 (standard version) or #250 glossy version. This limits
access, public discourse and debate, the raison d'etre of the EIA
process.
In contrast, Hydro-Quebec released a ''free'' detailed report for the
Grande-Baleine (Great Whale) mega-project on James Bay, representing 11
years of intensive studies, costing more than $256m. The comprehensive,
5000-page report has a 300-page summary. The cost was factored into the
project.
The Skye EIA document also misstated facts, wrongly claiming that
''all aspects of the design have been adequately considered and that all
reasonable precautions have been taken''. The objective of the Skye
crossing was to provide a privately- financed fixed crossing as
explained by an earlier Government Green Paper.
But the EIA failed to cost the alternative schemes and was affected by
a conflict of Government interest. The Government is effectively
interventionist, since it is both the promoter and overseer of the
project.
Work began on the project before the public inquiry had reported in
February 1992. The process was coloured with cynicism and characterised
by hypocrisy. A campaign of direct action resulted in arrests of
demonstrators for breach of the peace near the construction site.
The Secretary of State employed his discretion and disregarded the
recommendation of the public inquiry for a further EIA concerning bridge
design and otter protection. In Stevens &amp; Others vs Secretary of State,
an appeal was lodged in the Court of Session, seeking suspension of the
scheme.
The limited nature of the public inquiry, the premature choice of the
developer and the failure to conduct a further EIA coloured the process.
In particular, the Scottish Office placed political pressure on the
National Trust for Scotland, straddling the boundaries between executive
and judicial functions.
The Government sought the views of the Countryside Commission for
Scotland and the National Trust for Scotland and Royal Fine Arts
Commission for Scotland, who favoured a cable-stay bridge.
However, the Skye Bridge is the 'cheapest' tenderer's box girder
design, which was criticised by the National Trust before it changed its
position and sold crucial land after a high-pressure visit from Scottish
Office officials. This was undemocratic and unethical.
Stevens failed in the Court of Session, not on the merits of her case,
but because of the narrow and arcane rules of pleading in Scots Law. An
important interlocutory motion concerned the 1979 Berne Convention on
the Conservation of European Wildlife and Habitats, which provides for
the protection of certain species, including otters.
Although adopted by an EU Council decision, the issue was whether it
was fully incorporated into United Kingdom law, even though Britain
reputedly implemented the Berne Convention by passing the 1981 Wildlife
and Countryside Act.
Stevens was prevented from amending her pleadings and had to pay legal
expenses. The larger question remains whether Britain partially
implemented its EU obligations and what steps are necessary to ensure
compliance with this treaty.
EIA law is new and only starting to develop in Britain. The courts
will eventually have to clarify the legal requirements necessary to
ensure a functionally-proper environmental impact assessment. But the
Government, lawyers and the judiciary have rendered the EIA process
impotent by treating it merely as yet another form of localised planning
law.
The Skye appeal went through two years of interlocutory motions and
procedural skirmishes which inhibited the court from determining the
merits of the claim. These public interest litigants were treated like
ordinary litigants.
The rules concerning court costs inhibit environmentally related
litigation. Public interest groups litigate less successfully than
private individuals, partly because EIA is in its infancy in Britain.
Judicial clarification is needed over its scope, yet the legal process
thwarts a proper appeal concerning the merits of the EIA.
The Skye Bridge court challenge raises serious questions about the
barriers facing environmentally-related, public-interest litigation. The
explicit willingness on the part of Government Ministers to deceive the
public is not new nor limited to environmental matters.
London has a reputation for closed government. The barriers to public
interest litigation involve the legal process, which needs to be
streamlined, as well as the abuse of process by the Government in the
decision making process.
These barriers to justice are perpetuated by a Government which
eschews freedom of information, which classifies virtually all
Government documents as privileged and prevents ''discovery'' or use of
them by litigants.

TO be honest, I have never been the greatest admirer of rugby league.
It is mostly a game of very set patterns, where spontaneity often takes
second place to sheer strength, tactical kicking hardly features, and
their scrummaging could be prosecuted under the Trades Descriptions Act.
Yet, I have to say the audacity and fast decision-making of their
ruling body has quite taken my breath away.
In just a few hours at the weekend almost 100 years of tradition has
been dumped into the dustbin. The time of the playing season has been
switched and clubs have been ruthlessly merged. A 14-team Super League,
including two clubs from France, begins next year. All this was approved
unanimously.
''We were stuck in a rut,'' declared the RFL chief exectutive Maurice
Lindsay, ''and it was time we sought out new pastures. This is a golden
opportunity to put our sport on the world map.''
Obviously, the bait which has been swallowed by the club chairmen,
some of who will be writing their own P45s in the process, is the money
from Mr Rupert Murdoch's company. News Corporation are reported to be
investing #330m in the sport world-wide and #30m of that will be spent
in Europe.
No doubt lucrative television deals are part of the product. Yet it is
still an enormous gamble, a leap into the light, perhaps, as most of the
major matches will now take place in the summer.
Will the fans continue to support the sport as it does battle with
cricket, golf, athletics, racing -- all the sunshine activities? Will
loyalists who have proudly borne the colours of Wakefield, Castleford
and Featherstone really rally around a new team to be named Bradford
Calder? Will rugby league attract more recruits from rugby union?
No-one knows the answers, but it is sure going to be interesting
finding out.
Other sporting bodies may look at the RL authorities with some envy,
they may wish they could act so boldly. After all, how many versions of
the premier division have been discussed in Scottish football, how often
have all the clubs agreed on any proposed structure?
Next season sees a new league set-up in Scottish rugby -- nothing as
radical as the RFL proposals -- yet already critics are wondering aloud
whether we have got it right.
On specific points the changes in the RFL plan will appeal to some.
Gavin Hastings has long been arguing that his game would be better with
a winter break, played on drier pitches.
Against that many others argue that there would be more injuries on
harder grounds. Rugby league does not have rucks and mauls, but players
are tackled to the ground in pretty fierce fashion.
The whole concept of the Super League is one which will attract
support from many in rugby union and football. Would Rangers not benefit
if they had entry to a similar competition, would the rugby districts
not improve if they had more meaningful competition? I believe any
ballot would produce a resounding vote in favour.
Much will depend, of course, on what televsion audience the rugby
league matches can command. Sponsors will wait to see -- they may recall
when night-time cricket was punted as the answer to some of that sport's
problems.
Rugby league will have to be exciting, the Super League to be anything
but a one-horse race if interest is to be generated. The sport will have
to broaden its international role, persuade more countries to take it
up.
Until it does I do not anticipate any mass exodus from the union code.
The World Cup in South Africa next month will eclipse anything rugby
league is likely to offer in the forseeable future, including the Super
League.
Some players will transfer for money, many more will hope that union
will also be able to give them a bigger financial return than at
present. Even so, it would be monumentally silly for the International
Board or the Home Unions committee to dismiss this as another vain
attempt of rugby league to grab some of the limelight. Mr Murdoch is not
renowned for throwing money on to the bonfire.
This is the most fundamental change made by any sport in this country
since tennis abolished the distinction between amateur and professional
players. We would all do well to ponder on the implications.

When Sherpa Tensing reached the top of Mount Everest he was wearing a

known as the bunnet town and fancy headgear is still made here, such as
ceremonial bunnets for the Scottish regiments. The Bonnet Guild, set up
in 1933, is central to the local carnival in June when there are
parades, led by the dux of the school, the Corsehill Queen.
Other local employers include the Riverside Bakeries and the expanding
Filtronic Comptek, whose director, Douglas Young, says: 'We hope to
employ another 24 by the end of 1995. Many people have already relocated
to the town to work in the cellular telecommunications industry.'
Stewarton has a 30-minute rail link to Glasgow, running on the hour
and more frequently at peak times. The A77 or Mearns Cross road link is
quite arduous, and the new M77 is eagerly awaited to open up the route
to the city. Stewarton is well placed in a circle of towns Ayr, East
Kilbride, Kilmarnock, Paisley, Irvine.
Over the last three decades, Stewarton expanded due to its popularity
with commuters to Glasgow and Paisley. The population is now around
9000, and the small town retains a peaceful, villagey atmosphere.
Stewarton Academy has a high reputation and attracts pupils from as
far as Irvine. Other amenities include the recent Presto supermarket,
though this may have been a factor in the number of shops boarded up
just around the corner. Kilmarnock, with its good shops, is only 10 to
15 minutes away.
The bowling club is active and there are football and tennis courts
for public use. The town has a library, and a number of fine churches.
The Corsehill Banks of the Cunningham Watt Park offer steep walks. At
Games Hill, developments have encroached on what was once a pleasant
place to walk the dog. Local highspots are of the eating and drinking
variety, and there is an excellent Chinese restaurant, the Oriental
Palace, offering Glasgow quality at country prices. Chapeltoun House is
a distinguished country house restaurant on the outskirts of town.
Friday nights at the Mill House Hotel bar bring together the towns many
characters.
Since the collapse of the housing market in the late Eighties, fewer
people have moved to Stewarton from areas like Newton Mearns. As in many
other Ayrshire towns, it is the centre that has suffered, and there are
quite a few shops vacant in Stewarton's Main Street area.
There is a conservation area around Avenue Square but money has not
yet been forthcoming for often-suggested improvements.
Carole Sinclair, sales negotiator at Avonside Homes, says: 'It is
quiet throughout Ayrshire at the moment, and there is a general feeling
that people are frightened to move in case they cannot sell their own
home and may not get open-ended bridging.
'We can offer a number of incentives to try to offset these fears. Our
second phase has just been released, and there have been a lot of
enquiries from the south side of Glasgow. Bungalows in particular are
popular, with a two-bedroom detached at A67,500.'
Stewarton is one of those towns with a few nice areas, and a few
not-so-nice. There is also a small top end of the market on streets such
as Cutstraw Road, the top of Bowes Rigg and Dunlop Street, and these
tend to sell quickly.
Stewarton has a great choice of properties at at the bottom end of the
market. An important part in the housing chain are the ex- Scottish
Special Housing starter homes, such as those at Jubilee Place, at about
A35,000, depending on how much modernisation has taken place.
Prices tend to be comparable with Kilmarnock, and markedly cheaper
than Newton Mearns. A semi-detached house that would cost A80,000 in
Newton Mearns would cost A30,000 less in Stewarton.
Gary McCullock, valuer at Allen &amp; Harris, says: 'Sales are slower than
in Kilmarnock, and it is a difficult market at the moment.'
As the local agent, James Thomson, owner of James Thomson &amp; Co. in
Main Street, is often involved in property matching within the town. He
sells homes from A25,000 flats to country property at A200,000, and
knowing who is selling and buying in the area means that the vagaries of
the market are minimised.
He told me that there is a fair amount of new-build in the town, from
Moulds, Wilson, Templeton and the up-market Avonside. Thomson &amp; Co is
involved in the resale of many developments built in the Seventies and
Eighties which offer good value for money.
There are attractive country properties surrounding the town,
including converted farmhouses and cottages. John Terry, valuer at
Slater, Hogg &amp; Howison, says: 'We find that farmhouse conversions are
popular on the road to Dunlop, three miles away.'
It could be the best time to buy, says Rena Hennedy, negotiator at
Goodfellow. 'Nothing is sold quickly, and a bargain could be had.'
Stewarton folk may live in hope that the property market will improve.
In the meantime, the town could brighten its rather downbeat image by
addressing the problems of the depressing townscape of Main Street, and
the graffiti of the rail shelter.

CRYSTAL Palace have urged their fans to boycott tonight's FA Cup
semi-final replay against Manchester United at Villa Park following the
death of a fan before Sunday's original tie.
Selhurst Park director Colin Noades insists the Football Association
are wrong not to postpone the match -- and he has hit out at holders
United for failing to condemn the violence.
Noades, brother of club chairman Ron Noades, expects fewer than 4000
fans to travel from south London compared to the 15,000 who went to
Sunday's 2-2 draw.
That match was marred by a brawl outside a pub eight miles away at
Walsall where Palace fan Paul Nixon was crushed under the wheels of a
coach as he fled United supporters.
Palace wanted the match put back a week as a mark of respect and also
to allow feelings to cool down.
The police, however, said it should go-ahead tomorrow as scheduled and
Noades said: ''Following the FA's refusal to postpone the forthcoming
fixture against Manchester United, we are actively encouraging our
supporters to boycott Wednesday's fixture.
''We sincerely believe that the match should not be played so soon
after the dreadful events of last Sunday, and we are anxious to avoid
any further serious incidents.''
Apart from respect to the dead man's family, to carry on as if nothing
has happened is quite ridiculous and quite inappropriate.
''We believe that it is long overdue for Manchester United to make a
statement concerning their 'supporters'' activities and to take the
necessary action.''
United manager Alex Ferguson made a personal plea for sanity
yesterday, saying: ''The way to peace has got to be found. We must get
rid of hooligans once and for all.''
Ferguson and Palace manager Alan Smith will take to the Villa Park
pitch before kick-off to appeal for calm over the loudspeaker system.
Smith received a call from the Football Association yesterday asking him
to talk to fans and he readily agreed.
''I have no problem with that,'' he said. ''This game is something to
be enjoyed.''
FA spokeswoman Clare Tomlinson said the FA had no doubts that the
replay should take place as planned.
''We believe the game should go on because the West Midlands police
are the people in the best position to give that advice,'' she said.

RANGERS' boss Walter Smith was at Burnden Park last night running yet
another check on Bolton central defender Alan Stubbs, who has become a
major close-season target for the Ibrox men, writes Ken Gallacher.
Twenty-three-year old Stubbs has been one of the major stars in
Bolton's successful run this season, a run which took them to the final
of the Coca-Cola Cup against Liverpool and looks set to carry them into
the Premiership at the end of the season.
Stubbs has been a constant lure for Rangers this season as they look
towards their summer team-strengthening programme.
And the central defensive area is one that might concern Smith in the
summer. The Turkish side Fenerbahce are ready to watch Basile Boli on
Sunday if the French star is fit to play against Hibs in what might be a
title decider.
They are also reputed to be ready to pay close to #2m for Boli, who
has been something of a misfit at Ibrox since he joined them from
Marseille at the start of last season.
It would be a deal which could suit Rangers. They would get very close
to their money back for Boli and be able to invest in a younger player
who is more suited to the Scottish game.
Stubbs would cost around #2.5m but would be an investment for the
future as well as being someone who would be an immediate first team
member at the heart of the Rangers' defence.

DEREK DOUGLAS, chief rugby writer, in Bucharest
SCOTLAND'S debut in the Junior Rugby World Cup was marred yesterday by
a display of wanton violence by their Russian opponents, who had a
player sent off and a replacement cited by a FIRA official for running
on to the pitch and kicking a Scottish player on the head as he lay on
the ground.
The Scotland under-19 team manager David Sole has drafted a letter to
the tournament organisers in which the conduct of the Russians will be
condemned in forceful terms.
Sole, Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam captain, said last night: ''We shall
be making very strong representations to FIRA and telling them that we
were very unhappy with what went on out there today. Our boys behaved
superbly in the face of appalling provocation,
''The kind of thing that we saw today just cannot be condoned.''
The Russians were summoned to a FIRA disciplinary meeting last night,
when their ill-discipline -- which South African referee Willem Henning
described as worse than anything he had seen before -- was expected to
lead to severe punishment and even exclusion from the tournament.
The FIRA disciplinary committee viewed video evidence late into the
night and any punishments will be announced today. FIRA vice-president
Jose Epalza, of Spain, said he was saddened by what had occurred. The
possibility of sending the entire Russian team home had been discussed,
but that ultimate sanction was unlikely to be taken. However, there was
likely to be severe punishment for the players sent off and for the
cited replacement.
In the face of severe provocation, Scotland won 35-0, but the result
was overshadowed by the bar-room brawling tactics of the Russians which
could have resulted in serious injury to the young Scots.
There were three serious flare-ups in the game. The first occurred
after 14 minutes, when the Russian forwards erupted en masse, swinging
fists and boots. The Scottish hooker, Gary Hodgson, was kicked by
Russian prop Alexei Spirine as he lay on the ground.
Almost immediately, after another fracas, the Polish touch judge
flagged for foul play and the other Russian prop, Sergei Novosselov,
received his marching orders for another kicking incident.
The third incident occurred after an hour when, once again, the
Russian forwards were involved in a brutal assault on the Scottish pack.
Boots and fists flew in all directions and, once again, Hodgson was
kicked on the ground by the Russian Oleg Joukov.
Simultaneously, as the Russians kicked and punched Scottish players at
random, a Russian replacement, Oleg Chevtchenko, ran from the bench at
the side of the pitch to kick another Scottish player who was on the
ground.
He was seen by FIRA official Michelle Lamoullie of France, who said
later that the incident would be discussed at a meeting with the Russian
coach and manager.
According to the Scottish players, team doctor Harry Burnett was also
a target for Russian punches as he moved in from the touchline in an
effort to separate the two packs of forwards.
The referee, who is a police officer in Pretoria, said later: ''I have
never experienced anything like this before, and certainly not at
schools or under-19 level.
''Nothing could stop it. I can only impose discipline by means of the
whistle but they would not listen to it and there were kicks and fists
flying around. There was just no way of stopping it.''
The Russian side were obviously out of their depth at this level and
the flashpoints seemed to be ignited by legitimate Scottish rucking.
Despite the mayhem, the Scots scored five tries to underline their
technical superiority. At the interval they led 13-0 through a penalty
goal by Gavin Dalgleish and tries by Jamie Weston and Ewen Macdonald. In
the second period, tries came from Geoff Caldwell and Danny Bull (2).
Dalgleish had two conversions and a penalty goal.
The disciplinary committee also heard evidence last night from the
Welsh team manager Morris Davies and two Welsh players who claimed they
had been bitten during their game against Romania.
Yesterday's results: Spain 22, Poland 8; Uruguay 17, Portugal 12;
Wales 15, Romania 22; Scotland 35, Russia 0.
The Scottish management, keen to give every player an outing in the
opening two games, have rung the changes for the line-up to meet
Argentina today. Team:
S M Tomlinson (Selkirk); A R McLean (Boroughmuir), A Bulloch
(Hutchesons' GS), R D Kennedy (Stirling County), D G Bull (Stewart's
Melville FP); G J H Hay (Watsonians), G Beveridge (Peebles); M P J Smith
(Watsonians), C Docherty (GHK), G Lambie ( Edinburgh Wanderers), C W
Hunter (Currie), I A Fullarton (Kelso), S Murray (Edinburgh
Academicals), I W Sinclair (GHK/Dundee HSFP), S McNeill (Ross High).
Replacements -- G D Caldwell (Ayr), S Jenkins (Kilmarnock), G S
Dalgleish (Gala), A M Cadzow (Boroughmuir/Caithness), G Talac
(Musselburgh), G Hodgson (Newcastle Gosforth), J R Kelly (Harlequins).

CITY centre developments with convenient locations and spectacular
views are relatively rare, so it is hardly surprising that interest has
been exceptionally high in the second phase of the Clarke Homes
development at Carrick Quay, overlooking the River Clyde.
The first phase of the development, which consisted of 36 properties
comprising two-bedroom apartments and three-bedroom houses attracted
widespread interest among Scottish homebuyers seeking something
different from the normal type of home environment. Now the second phase
of the multi-million pound development, which consists of 20 apartments
and two penthouses, has continued in the same vein, attracting more
intense interest.
Prices start from #69,950 and rise to #135,000 for a penthouse. Not
surprisingly, a further rush of enquiries is anticipated when the
split-level two and three-bedroom apartments and penthouses are released
for sale over the Easter weekend on April 15, at the same time as the
first show apartment is open to the public.
Steve Phillips, regional director of Clarke Homes, sees this
continuing interest as most encouraging, not merely for the Carrick Quay
development, but also for the private housing market in Scotland, which
is steadily recovering.
''We are delighted about the response to date, which gives us enormous
encouragement for our launch on Easter Saturday and for the Scottish
housing market as a whole,'' he said. ''Glasgow has a tremendous amount
of still untapped potential, which has been recognised by the amount of
developments currently underway. We believe Carrick Quay will add to the
blossoming city.''
The company claims that the Carrick Quay luxury apartment project,
which overlooks the River Clyde near the waterfront, is the only
development of its kind in Glasgow's inner city. The project began five
years ago as a partnership venture with an Edinburgh-based building
company and a sister company of Clarke Homes, but is now solely a Clarke
Homes undertaking.
Work on the second phase of the project restarted following an 18
months pause while the dissolution of the previous joint venture company
was completed and sole control reverted to Clarke Homes.
While many homes completed during the first phase were eventually sold
to business and professional people attracted by Carrick Quay's close
proximity to the commercial heart of the city, Clarke Homes feels the
second phase will probably appeal to a broader section of the
home-buying public, including families keen to move back into the city.
A notable feature of the resumption of the Carrick Quay project has
been a steadily increasing number of enquires the company has received
from potential buyers seeking information about prices and completion
dates. As in many other parts of the United Kingdom, there is a lot of
interest in shifting back into the city centre and Clarke Homes is
confident that interest will peak when the first show apartment opens
its doors during the Easter weekend.
Clarke Homes feel that the exceptionally high specification of the new
homes, as well as their superb views over the river will appeal to a
wide cross-section of home buyers.
The company has always prided itself on the quality of the kitchens it
installs and it is confident that those provided in the new apartments
and penthouses will find favour with housewives of all ages. They are
fully fitted with hob, oven, microwave, dishwasher, fridge and freezer,
while a wide selection of kitchen finishes and sanitaryware and
wall-tiling is on offer, to cater for even the most fastidious buyer.
Clarke Homes has a long-established reputation for providing quality
homes and is the only holder of the NHBC's ''Outstanding Achievement
Award'' an accolade specially created for the company in recognition of
what has been described as its ''outstanding record for quality and
consistency''.

ONE of the joys of the seven-a-side game always has been the
encouragement given in the wide open spaces for players of smaller
stature to demonstrate those twinkling arts of deception that are not
quite within the province of the fellows with more ballast to lug
around.
There is no more enjoyable sight in the current short game than that
of Mark Moncrieff of Gala, slim as a pencil, using every method of
evasion in confined space.
There he was against Villager, the South African club side, at the
Greenyards on Saturday, seemingly about to enter a two-man mincing
machine. Yet he came off either foot in a blink, had the impudence to
use hand off, then went into orbit like a launch missile to leave the
would-be mincers clutching fresh air.
His scrum half colleague, Grant Farquharson, is another skinny wee
soul, but a little wizard of deceptive body sway, sizzling side-step and
blistering take-off.
Ken Harper of Stirling County, now 32, still demonstrates unfettered
zest and speed of thought and action in sevens. Donald Fowler of
Heriot's is another slip of a lad, but full of guile and with confidence
in his pace as in scoring three tries in three ties at Gala and Melrose.
He kicks goals as well.
Mark Grieve never lets Langholm's difficulties get him down. Like his
father Robert, a former Langholm scrum half, he never throws in the
towel and even on short rations lives up to his nickname ''Jinky.''
In the closely policed environs of the fuller version those smaller
artistes who operate closer to the floor are more easily curbed, but
find much fuller expression of their special gifts in the open prairie
of the abbreviated version.
There seems to be a trend, however, even in sevens, towards bigger
fellows. Thus at the Greenyards on Saturday the backs who made the
biggest impression mostly were well-built lads who could scoot.
Stuart Lang of Kelso is 6ft 3in and ran in six gorgeous tries before
Manly from Sydney paid him the compliment of claustrophobic marking.
Percival Montgomery of Villager, rangy, elusive and very quick, was the
tournament's top scorer.
Luke Donnan of Manly, with the build of a cruiserweight boxer, was so
well endowed in undercarriage as to flick off would-be tacklers with a
sway of the hips and a splurge of pace.
Meli Nakuata of Manly is built like Frank Bruno and a formidable lad
once he had stopped showing off, to his and his side's detriment,
against Dundee HS FP, for whom Dougie Gray struck a blow for the smaller
ones by harassing the big Fijian into his faux pas.
Nowadays the tendency is for at least two very big men and preferably
a strong, stocky guy, who has ball skills and can hook.
In the final, Manly had a club centre, Trent Herring, as hooker,
because he is a tough cookie who can shift and with solid build for the
scrummage graft and a back's ball handling expertise.
Kelso had as hooker that rare sevens maestro, Clive Millar, perhaps
not quite as quick as formerly, but with instinct and acumen built over
the years.
The successful sevens at Melrose were those who had two very big
forwards who did not look out of place on the sevens field and a third
with an inbuilt outboard motor that never seemed to run out of gas. The
big men deal with lineouts and restart kicks and, because of their
build, can hold their own scrummage fairly steady while having the power
to disrupt opposition ball.
Langholm, for example, played their threequarter, Bryce Middleton, as
tight head prop and to expect him to hold the much bigger and heavier
Duncan Gillies of Manly in the scrummages was asking too much.
Which is one reason why Melrose might play the strongly-built centre
Ross Brown at prop, thus releasing the lighter Andrew Purves for back
division duty. Young Ross thus also would benefit from the wise counsel
of his father, Peter, one of the great sevens specialists during Gala's
halcyon times.
The secret in sevens is in getting the blend right with, all things
being equal, the bigger the better. But the game would lose much of its
character and attraction without those smaller exponents, who bring
crowds to their feet by countering brawn and muscle with fleetness and
nimbleness of foot and occasionally a big helping of impertinence.

Hibernian 1, Celtic 3
CELTIC powered their way into to the Scottish Cup final with this
replay victory over Hibernian last night at Ibrox. Now, they will face
first division side Airdrie at Hampden on May 27.
And as their fans experienced the feeling of deja vu, with memories of
the Coca-Cola Cup final and Raith Rovers' victory last November, manager
Tommy Burns put their minds at rest.
For, after Celtic's 3-1 win, Burns immediately addressed these fears.
''I know what will be said. Here we have Airdrie, another first division
team, and back in November we lost to Raith Rovers in the final,'' he
said. ''But we have learned from that.
''Believe me, we have learned from the experience of losing in that
game and we don't intend to let it happen again.
''This was a victory which pleased me. It was something the players
deserved, and something that the support deserved for the way they have
backed us.''
Certainly, Burns and his team could not have asked for any better
backing than they received last night.
From the beginning, the fans were with them, and they remained there
throughout a match which Celtic dominated for all but a short period in
the second half when Hibs scored their only goal of the game, but, by
then, the tie should have been beyond their reach.
Celtic had taken the lead after 32 minutes when Paul McStay sent the
ball through towards Willie Falconer just inside the Hibs penalty box.
Falconer fired in an angled shot from the left which beat Jim Leighton
and nestled in the back of the net.
That signalled a period of intense Celtic pressure in which Falconer
could have scored twice more before the break.
Instead, it was left to John Collins to push the Parkhead men two
goals in front.
Hibs' defence, so secure in the first match, crumbled when the ball
was played into the goalmouth. Steven Tweed could only partially clear
and the ball fell to John Collins. He had time to steady himself, look
up, and then flight the ball into the net -- the lob was so perfect that
Leighton was left unable even to make an attempt to stop it.
Yet, before these goals, Hibs had had the best opening of the game in
26 minutes when centre-half Tweed sent the ball wide from a cross from
Willie Miller.
Afterwards, Hibernian manager Alex Miller said: ''I think Steven had
switched off. He thought that Michael O'Neill was going to get it.
''Steven somehow got the ball between his legs but sent his effort
wide. If he had scored then things could have been different.''
But, of course, they didn't and while Keith Wright did score after 63
minutes, it never looked like being enough to worry Celtic.
That goal arrived when Miller crossed from the right, and Pat McGinlay
and Pat Bonner both went for the ball. It broke between them and Wright
was there, unmarked, to strike the ball beyond Bonner and into the net.
It was around then that Celtic suffered their only uneasy period in
the game.
But, in 72 minutes, Andy Walker could have ended the nervousness which
had begun to flow through the Ibrox stands. McStay carved out a glorious
opening and the striker wasted it with a careless finish.
Eight minutes from time, however, Phil O'Donnell, who had replaced the
injured Peter Grant in 56 minutes, struck the decisive third goal.
Rudi Vata crossed from the right and O'Donnell was at the far post to
guide a header into the net, a strike that put the result beyond doubt.
Celtic had reached the final. But, more important, it also gave them
the chance to end a five-year spell without a major trophy.
There were two bookings in the game, Darren Jackson for a late tackle
on Brian McLaughlin midway through the first half, and then, just before
full-time, Falconer for kicking the ball away after a decision had gone
against him.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, Miller, Mitchell, McGinlay, Tweed, Millen,
Harper, McGraw, Wright, Jackson, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Tortolano,
Evans, Reid.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, O'Neil, Grant, McLaughlin,
McStay, Falconer, Walker, Collins. Substitutes -- Donnelly, O'Donnell,
Marshall.
Referee -- J Rowbotham (Kirkcaldy).

* PAUL Gascoigne was dropped by Lazio last night as the Rome club
crashed out of the Italian Cup semi-finals against Juventus.
Gascoigne returned after a year out with a broken leg in Lazio's 2-0
home victory over Reggiana on Sunday, but the tougher proposition of
playing championship favourites Juventus in Turin prompted a recall for
Dutch star Aron Winter.
Juventus then finished off the job they began with a 1-0 victory in
the first leg in Rome and secured a 3-1 aggregate success by virtue of a
2-1 win.

Under what Mactaggart and Mickel call their Major Ownership Scheme
(MOS), purchasers need, if they wish, finance only 80% of the purchase
price of a property with a 20% interest retained by the company.
This one-fifth share can be bought out at any time by the purchaser,
or it can be maintained to be repaid on the sale of the house, its
transfer, or if the original purchaser ceases to live in it.
Mactaggart and Mickel's current developments in the west include the
following:
Bankhead, Rutherglen, one-bedroom flats from #49,965; three-bedroom
houses from #74,589. Broomcastle, Newton Mearns, one-bedroom
semi-detached bungalows with garage from #64,198; two-bedroom flats with
parking space from #64,532. Castlefarm, Newton Mearns, two and
three-bedroom semi-detached priced from #73,282; three, four, and
five-bedroomed detached houses from #133,774.
At Waterfoot the exclusive Eaglesham Park by the river Cart offers
high-specification two-bedroom bungalows and four-bedroom villas, all
detached and with garages. Prices from #149,214.
Higher Broom in Newton Mearns has two and three-bedroom bungalows, all
detached and with double garages, with starting prices from #125,746.
Still in Newton Mearns, Mearnscroft offers three and four-bedroom
detached properties with garages, built in a quiet cul-de-sac with
hilltop views over the area. Prices from #180,107.
On the Ayrshire coast Mactaggart and Mickel has two and three-bedroom
detached bungalows and three-bedroom detached villas on offer from
#98,307 at Greenan, Ayr, and coming on offer soon, at Barassie Links,
Troon, will be three-bedroom detached bungalows, three-bedroom
semi-detached villas, and five-bedroom detached villas -- all with
garages. (No prices available yet.)
In Edinburgh's Gilmerton, Gilmerton Mews has two and three-bedroom
terraced and semi-detached houses from #55,170, while at Bonaly,
Colinton, just two three-bedroom homes with garages remain for sale,
from #108,320 within this courtyard development.
There's a similar picture at South Gyle, Corstorphine, where only one
two-bedroom house with parking space remains available at present, price
from #58,803. A new phase is to be released shortly.
At Hillpark Pines, a prestigious development of four, five, and
six-bedroom detached houses with double or triple garages, just one
four-bedroom property remains available. It has four public rooms,
cloakroom, utility room, and shower room at ground level, while the
master bedroom has a luxurious en suite. Price on application. A new
phase is planned for later this year.
Work is now under way at Torphin at Colinton, where high-specification
three-bedroom semi-detached, three, four, and five-bedroom detached
homes are being constructed. A show house complex is scheduled to open
by early August.

JUST months after thinking his career was over, Airdrie-born Alan
Thomson makes a bid to return to the Scottish team this weekend when he
joins Dave Gordon, Stuart Cowie and David Heath in a selection decider
for the European championships in Amsterdam in two weeks' time.
With Peter Nicol and Martin Heath already guaranteed selection, three
places remain up for grabs, and the only noted absentee from the
Heriot-Watt session is Barry Sutherland, this season's domestic No.1.
Sutherland, who has won five Scottish grand prix titles and suffered
his only defeat from world top-20 player Tony Hands in the North Open,
is playing in the Topsquash finals, but he must be a strong candidate to
retain his place in the team that won bronze at last year's Europeans.
For London-based Thomson, holder of 64 caps, surely nothing short of
three victories will secure a remarkable comeback. The 35-year-old has
undergone two operations to his left knee since he last played for
Scotland, in the 1993 European championships.
''I had the second operation in August and started my comeback in
November,'' he said. ''But it has gone remarkably well and I'm now
playing regularly in the Middlesex and Surrey county leagues. I've got a
lot to prove this weekend, but I wouldn't be coming north unless I
thought I had a real chance.''

SCOTTISH internationalist Craig Robertson's dreams appeared to come
true this week when he was given a place in Scotland's team for the
World championships in Switzerland next month.
However, the Fauldhouse player is not as jubilant as you would expect
following the news of Jim Mailer's late withdrawal from the team because
of work commitments.
''I'm not as buzzed as I could have been, because I was really
disappointed not to be selected first time around,'' said Robertson, who
recently quit his job and set up a coaching business in order to play
more badminton.
''It was such a downer that I didn't even feel like playing for a few
weeks afterwards. I seriously wondered if giving up my job to play more
had been worth it.''
Robertson will now have to work doubly hard, having already missed two
weeks of squad training, but the 24-year-old fully intends making the
best of his opportunity.
''It's ideal that the chance has come along,'' he said. ''Hopefully,
things will get better and better.''
Mailer insists his withdrawal is not a sign that badminton will be
taking a back seat in his future plans.
* SCOTLAND finished second last in the European Junior Team
championships in Slovakia and have been relegated to the Finlandia Cup
section. Results:
Scotland 2, Norway 3; Scotland 0, Bulgaria 5; Scotland 0, Finland 5;
Scotland 3, Wales 2.

ARCHWAY Developments sales staff are toasting the runaway success of
their very first development opening in Glasgow's Maryhill, building on
sister developments at Shettleston.
Within a matter of months of the Maryhill sales office opening, a
first block of 18 flats were sold and a second block trio sold also,
with 15 remaining prices starting from #55,750, sales spokesperson
Sharon McEwan reported.
Sales negotiator Moira Stewart is enjoying a double celebration. So
confident was she and her family of the craftsmanship and quality of the
flats that they have bought two of them.
Jennifer Scott, the sales manager, said: ''Moira's family purchase of
our properties more than demonstrates the confidence our team has in the
success of our first development.
''We have in fact been overwhelmed by the number of inquiries about
the flats and hope this success will be reflected in all our future
developments.''
Located in Maryhill Road next to Maryhill Park, Killermont Court --
with its central location close to amenities and set within private
grounds -- is the first of several new developments to be launched in
Glasgow by Archway Developments Ltd in association with the Walker Group
(Scotland) and the Archdiocese of Glasgow.
Walker Group is relatively unknown in the West of Scotland but this
has now all changed.
Involved in many major construction developments throughout east and
central Scotland since 1969, more recent Walker Group projects include
the Westerwood championship golf course, hotel, and a 600 private
housing development and Broadwood football stadium with associated
housing in Cumbernauld.
Meanwhile the Archway Developments Shettleston site is almost
completely sold. Sales staff have been inundated with both visitors and
inquiries. So much so that Jennifer Scott considered hiring a weekend
commissionaire to deal with the crowds.
''We were taken aback with the overwhelming interest and could not
believe that so many of our properties were snapped up so quickly,'' she
said.
Archway reported that many local people have shown a keenness to move
into a new home while not necessarily leaving the area.
The new flats development at Shettleston has followed on from sales
success of the neighbouring development on Shettleston Road. Opposite
Archway's existing Sycamore Gardens development, St Paul's Court
comprises a block of 15 two-bedroom flats -- ideally suited for
first-time buyers.
Jennifer said St Paul's Court will share the same sales rate as
Sycamore Gardens: ''In just three months all 12 three-bedroom villas
were sold there.''
It represents a by now familiar success story with buyers increasingly
seeking out Archway Developments for their new home.

JAMIE Gallacher took the first step on the road to achieving what
father Bernard failed to when he won his first-round tie in the Mobil
Scottish Boys' Golf Championship at Royal Aberdeen yesterday.
The Ryder Cup captain never even reached the final of the prestigious
event during his time in short trousers, but the 17-year-old's 5 and 3
win over Fifer Paul Wheatley still left the possibility of the Gallacher
name being engraved on the trophy come Saturday.
''I was never behind and chipped in at the fifteenth from 10 yards off
the green to win, which is quite ironic, because last year my pitching
around the greens was one of the weakest parts of my game,'' said
Gallacher, who admitted he has been working hard over the past 12 months
with his father as well as coaches John Jacobs and Lee Johnson.
Gallacher also revealed he had turned down not only a school trip to
play some of America's best courses, such as Baltusrol, but also a
lying-on-the-beach fortnight with mum Lesley in Florida to play in the
championship.
''It was sort of a joint decision between my dad and me that I come up
here, but I think it was the right one, because I can benefit from the
experience of playing in an event like this,'' said Jamie.
Joining Gallacher in the second round were the remaining current
Scottish Boy caps in action, Oliver Lindsay of Murrayfield and West
Kilbride's Graham Fox, who between them completed a Dundee double.
At the top end of the draw, defending champion Steven Young became one
of 30 players to make it into the third round, but he struggled against
Ratho Park's Lee Bain, losing four holes on the trot from the twelfth
before claiming the sixteenth and seventeenth for victory.
''I've never hit so many bad shots in a row in my life,'' he moaned.
''I'm just glad to be through, because I would have hated to go out of
my last championship that way. Hopefully that is the bad round out of
the way for the week.''
* DEFENDING champion Alison Gemmill gave warning of her impressive
early season form yesterday with two conclusive victories in moving into
the semi-finals of the Ayrshire Women's championship at Troon Portland.
Results:
First round: A Gemmill (Kilmarnock Barassie) beat N McCrossin (Troon
Ladies), 7 and 6; G Brown (Caprington) w/o J Finnie (Troon Ladies) scr;
C Malcolm (Prestwick St Cuthbert's) beat A Sharp (Troon Ladies), 7 and

<HEADLINE>Kilmarnock bid to secure their place among premier the elite. Stepping away from trapdoor</HEADLINE>

WHILE Partick Thistle have been stealing the headlines with their
great relegation-defying stunts, another side who were close to landing
in the trapdoor vicinity, Kilmarnock, managed to call a halt to a minor
slump and as a result have jumped up the premier division table to a
spot that is very near safety, if there is such a haven in this bizarre
league.
Killie had been going along well enough until the wheels fell off.
They lost three games in a row and found themselves fourth bottom on the
same pointage as third-bottom Dundee United. If the slide had continued
there is no doubt they were heading for a bout of desperation football.
However, manager Alex Totten, who has been through this kind of thing
in the past, procured a couple of new faces, Billy Findlay from Hibs
and, more recently, Paul Wright from St Johnstone, and that
freshening-up process seems to have helped end the bad run. Certainly, a
victory at Pittodrie over Aberdeen last week was a pretty impressive way
to re-establish form.
It did no good for the northern team's own prospects, but there is not
much room for sympathy in a relegation fight as competitive as this one,
and if Kilmarnock can carry on the good work against Hearts tonight they
might well have secured their place among the elite for another season.
Totten doesn't like to go that far. Like all managers, he is wary of
forecasting anything in this division. ''You look at the players
Aberdeen have and you think: could they win all their games and take 15
points. Where would that leave the rest of us?''
Even so, if his men beat the Edinburgh lot, they would be 10 points
clear of the Pittodrie side stuck at the bottom. If Kilmarnock fail to
stay up in that situation they wll have managed a collapse of Wall
Street proportions.
Beating Hearts is all Totten wishes to concentrate upon, however, and
if his side are to do that they will need to do it without Mark Skilling
and Mark Reilly, both of whom are suspended for one game. Findlay and
Wright will be available, however, and the home debut of Wright will be
of special interest to the local fans. The #350,000 player, the
costliest ever for the Ayrshire club, did well at Perth, but his
confidence will have been lifted further by the goal he scored for the
reserves at Tannadice on Tuesday.
His arrival, like the new men bought by Falkirk, has raised morale at
a crucial time for a club facing up to the last lap in a long race. ''We
have six games left, four at home, two away, and we are confident we can
win enough points to be safe,'' said Totten. ''The lads know,
nevertheless, that we wll need to work our socks off to do it.''
He anticipates a Hearts side still smarting from the defeat in the cup
semi-final by Airdrie, and that, he senses, might make them more
dangerous. It may be so, but the Tynecastle manager, Tommy McLean, has
personnel problems, apart from anything else. John Robertson, Dave
McPherson, Kevin Thomas, Brian Hamilton and Willie Jamieson are all out
of contention because of injury.
McLean will still insist on a vast improvement from the performance in
the semi-final, particularly the first half. ''These players were big
enough to take the praise when it was going. Now they have to show they
can take the flak.''
The manager will decide on the line-up today, but emphasised his view
that, whoever he chooses, the men on the park will have to do something
to appease the disgruntled Gorgie faithful.
''Ten days ago this team was in the semi-final of the cup and chasing
a European place,'' he said. ''Now we are back in the relegation issue.
It is up to the players to make amends.''

SHINTY'S ability to attract major sponsorship deals continued
yesterday when the Camanachd Association announced a new three-year,
#40,000 deal with salmon farmers Marine Harvest McConnell.
The arrangement covers the pilot national league starting in August
and contains a novel bonus scheme. Depending on the success of the new
tie-up the association stands to net a further #4500 on top of the basic
#34,500.
Association president Duncan Cameron said: ''We have to prove to the
sponsors that we can deliver. We've assured clubs that we will have the
infrastructure for the new national league in place and that we will not
be asking them to undertake excessively long journeys in winter months.
If we all pull together we will be able to make this novel scheme a
success.''
Marine Harvest will also continue to sponsor club of the month awards
for the next three years as well as a national player of the year award.

Clydebank 1, Airdrie 1
BANKIES were well worth their share of the points at Kilbowie last
night and but for some careless finishing and two glorious saves from
Martin in the final 15 minutes could have put paid to the Diamonds'
promotion hopes for another season.
Airdrie did sparkle in the opening 45 minutes and did not deserve to
troop off at the interval a goal behind -- very much against the run of
play -- but the Bankies proved just how dangerous they can be on the
break.
In only six minutes a rocket shot from Airdrie's Black was well held
by Matthews and a net-bound drive by Boyle was cleared off the line by
McStay. Matthews again defied Boyle when he rose to touch a clever lob
over the bar.
Bankies' Grady came close to breaking the deadlock after 11 minutes
when his long-range drive beat Martin but crashed off the bar.
Airdrie seemed to be in control with Harvey and Davies dominating the
midfield and the latter brought out a magnificent stop from Matthews
with a glorious oblique drive.
Nine minutes from the interval Clydebank shocked the visitors by
taking the lead, an uncharactistic slip by Martin indirectly leading to
the goal.
The big keeper ran out of goal to clear an in-swinging corner from
Crawford but he mis-hit his clearance to Sutherland, who knocked the
ball into the goalmouth and Grady headed the ball over Airdrie defender
Stewart and into the net.
The visitors came close to equalising in a seven-minute spell just
before the break. Snap shots from Davies and Smith brought out fine
saves from Matthews and Smith was unfortunate just before the half-time
whistle to see his net-bound effort cleared off the line by McStay.
After the restart Airdrie went all out for the equaliser and
deservedly got it after 59 minutes. Harvey sent Boyle clear on the right
and his far-post cross was met by Andy Smith who nodded the ball to the
feet of Cooper who drilled the ball home.

KELSO was hit by its second embarrassing incident in less than a month
as controversial Jockey Club Rules resulted in yesterday's fourth race
being ruled void.
Officials were forced to bring the J Rutherford (Earlston) Handicap
Chase to a halt after Terrible Gel fell and died at the second fence and
prevented the field jumping the obstacle on the second circuit.
Leaders Boro Smackeroo and Charming Gale pulled up at the third last
fence when spotting a man frantically waving his flag. The other
remaining runners pulled up as they approached the next obstacle, the
fence where Terrible Gel lay.
At the Kelso meeting on March 24 a similar incident occurred. On that
occasion the result of the race was allowed to stand after the runners
had jumped the fence where a stricken horse lay.
An angry Howard Johnson, the trainer of Boro Smackeroo, called for an
immediate change in the rules. Steps are being taken to amend the rules
to allow a result to stand if a fence is missed out -- but no date has
been finalised.
Boro Smackeroo had been the subject of a huge gamble, being sent off
at 11-4 after being available at 11-2 in the morning.

Queen's Park 1, Montrose 0
MONTROSE'S bid for promotion was held up last night by an outstanding
display from Queen's Park.
Youngster Gary Kerr got the only goal of the game midway through the
second half, when he ran on to a through ball and stroked it into the
net beyond oncoming keeper Larter.
The goal was just reward for the Amateurs, who could easily have won
by a more commanding margin, having hit the post and missed a penalty
inside the first 25 minutes.
Caledonian Thistle 0
Albion Rovers 2
ALBION Rovers produced a fighting display to deny Caley Thistle a
fourth straight win against the league's bottom club this season.
The Inverness side put in a lacklustre showing in front of a sparse
crowd at Telford Street Park, while Rovers, looking for only their fifth
win of the season, battled well.
They took the lead in 26 minutes with a flash of skill from Dave
Thomson, who fired a 25-yard shot into the top right-hand corner.

LEEDS United may complain to UEFA over an alleged illegal approach to
manager Howard Wilkinson by Turkish club Galatasaray. The Istanbul club
are reported to be targeting Wilkinson as a successor to recently-sacked
German coach Reinhard Saftig.
It is believed the Elland Road chief, who rejected an approach by
Galatasaray four years ago, has been offered three-year deal worth up to
#3m.
Galatasaray made their move when Wilkinson, who has two years of his
Leeds contract to run, attended a meeting with them after being asked to
recommend British managers suitable for the job.
* THE Republic of Ireland squad for the European Championship
qualifier against Portugal at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, on April 26 is:

WESTERN Klick Photopoint will make their eighth successive appearance
in the final of the Scottish League Cup at Peffermill on Sunday, April
23, against Bonagrass Grove after beating arch-rivals Edinburgh Ladies
in an enthralling semi-final last night at Cramond.
The teams finished level at 1-1 after normal time and were still
locked together at 3-3 after the first series of penalty strokes, but it
was Western who clinched victory when Tracey Robb saved brilliantly from
her international colleague, Rhona Simpson, to give her side the
advantage.
Then June Burley, who had squandered Western's first effort of the
shoot-out, made her conversion and Western had won the penalty barrage
7-6.
In the early stages, Edinburgh Ladies looked the more likely winners,
and they opened the scoring through Louise Burton after Simpson and
Helen Walker had combined to set up the opening.
Western were rarely seen as an attacking force during the first half.
In the second half, Western stepped up the pace and in the eleventh
minute Susan MacDonald levelled the scores after taking a pass from
Wendy Fraser.

Brandon, Manitoba
SCOTLAND'S men, led by Gordon Muirhead, took another step towards the
World championships semi-finals on Friday with a workmanlike 5-3 victory
over Wales yesterday.
Muirhead had taken an early morning call before the game to hear that
his wife had given birth to a son, and celebrated with a solid
performance against Wales.
With the scores at 1-1 after three ends, the Scots scored 2 in the
fourth when Muirhead replaced a Welsh stone in the eight-foot ring while
lying second shot on the other side of the house. After that, the Scots
kept the initiative throughout.
The teams swopped singles at the fifth and sixth ends and then,
looking for the 2 that would bring them back level, Wales blanked the
seventh. Following another exchange of singles at the eighth and ninth
ends, Wales ran out of stones in the tenth and conceded.
The Scottish women's semi-final hopes are all but gone following two
more defeats, 6-5 by Canada and then 6-3 to Germany in a tight game that
they looked like winning until the ninth end.
At that point, the teams were level and Scotland, with last stone,
were looking good to score two and move ahead. Uncharacteristically,
skip Kirsty Hay had a complete miss with her last stone to give Germany
a steal of 2.
Despite this set-back, the Scots played well in the tenth end and
again looked good for two when Hay repeated her earlier mistake, giving
away a single and losing a game that she knows she should have won.
The game against Canada followed the same pattern as their earlier
defeat against Denmark, with Hay's team failing to capitalise on
unforced errors and tactical mistakes. Results:
MEN. Fifth round -- Norway 8, England 7; Switzerland 4, Australia 3;
Germany 5, Sweden 3; Canada 7, USA 6; Wales 3, Scotland 5.
Standings -- Canada won 5, lost 0; Germany 4-1; Scotland 4-1;
Switzerland 3-2; Australia 2-3; Norway 2-3; USA 2-3; England 1-4; Sweden
1-4; Wales 1-4.
WOMEN: Sixth round -- USA 7, Switzerland 3; Sweden 5, Norway 7; Canada
6, France 5; Scotland 3, Germany 6; Denmark 6, Japan 11.
Standings -- Canada won 6, lost 0; Norway 6-0; Germany 4-2; Sweden
4-2; USA 3-3; Japan 2-4; Scotland 2-4; Switzerland 2-4; Denmark 1-5;
France 0-6.

THE National Association of Basketball Coaches convention is an annual
gathering of the most prestigious coaches in that sport, plus
innumerable others who hope that they will some day reach those exalted
levels.
In fact, so mighty is the power wielded at the convention that many
aspiring coaches travel there with the sole intention of securing a
position at the most prestigious college possible.
Two weeks ago, this year's convention was held at the Sheraton Hotel
in Seattle, Washington, the lobby of which became a hunting ground for
those on the lookout for some big name coaches to prey upon.
''It's a bunch of piranhas gobbling up a goldfish,'' commented Pete
Gillen, coach of the powerful team from Providence College. ''After
walking through this lobby, you'd better count your fingers at the
elevator.''
Reportedly, there were numerous ploys for bringing yourself to the
attention of potential employers. One was to have yourself paged in the
lobby, another was to start a rumour about yourself.
Explained Mike Montgomery, coach at Stanford University: ''Somebody
starts a rumour that Bill is going to Eastern U for $50,000 a year, and
once it works its way around the lobby, it comes back half an hour later
that Bill is going to Eastern State for $8m a year plus two
Rolls-Royces.''
Of course, the Sheraton lobby in the wee hours may not even have been
the best place to secure a job, as indicated by the comments of one
unnamed coach. ''Gosh, I hope I haven't hired anyone tonight,'' he
muttered. ''I'm drunk as a loon.''
* THE double murder trial of American football superstar O J Simpson
continues with all the intrigue and poor taste of a Hollywood B movie.
Most tasteless of all is the manner in which all kinds of individuals on
the periphery have attempted to capitalise on Simpson's infamy.
Most recent has been a video production company which uncovered a film
of Brian Kaelin, Simpson's former tenant, singing a Karaoke version of
the Tom Jones' hit Delilah. The song refers to the stabbing of a woman
by her betrayed boyfriend. Inevitably, the video has become a big
seller, causing some to enquire if Simpson himself will get a cut -- of
the profits, that is.
* DURING the recent NCAA basketball championship play-offs, one of the
best performances came from Bryant Reeves, a centre for the team from
Oklahoma State University.
After Oklahoma had been eliminated from the tournament, Reeves was
asked if his impressive showing had enhanced his prospects for being
drafted into the NBA once he graduates from college. Replied Reeves:
''What happens to me next year will happen to me no matter what
happens.''
* THE University of Southern Indiana has been playing basketball in
the second division of the NCAA for the past 24 years. During that time,
the college has never once won a championship with the ball and hoop. At
least, not until this year.
On March 25, Indiana beat the team from UC Riverside 71-63 to take the
second division title. Some said that the outcome was inevitable. Just
one week prior to the championship game, Indiana had inaugurated as its
new college president Dr H Ray Hoops.
* SINCE the release of heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson from prison,
conjecture has been widespread about whether or not promoter Don King
will be allowed to manage his affairs. Depending on who you speak to,
King was responsible for some of Tyson's greatest fights or for his
ultimate demise.
But if King has anything to do with it, Tyson will quickly be right
where he wants him. Where King wanted Tyson last week was on a shopping
spree with his former sparring partner, the new heavyweight champion,
Oliver McCall.
Commented McCall following the buying extravaganza in Las Vegas: ''We
shopped until we dropped. We spent about $100,000. It was Don's idea. I
couldn't refuse. As a matter of fact, he paid for it. That's why we
spent so much.''
For what it's worth, when he sparred for Tyson, McCall earned $2500
per week. While he was in jail, Tyson earned around 75 cents per day.
Not surprisingly, King is under investigation by the Internal Revenue
Service.

THERE are few people in world football with the experience and
knowledge to enable them to re-structure our national game, but Ernie
Walker, who has been handed that task, is certainly one of them.
For the past few years Walker has spent his time touring the new
member countries of UEFA, helping them set up national associations,
advising them on how to train referees, coach players and, ultimately,
promote their own league and cup competitions.
It has been a demanding role for Walker and one which has a high
listing in the priorities of UEFA. Now it has given him the ideal
background for the job he has been handed by the Scottish Football
Association, the body he ruled for so many years.
Walker's brief in Europe has been far-reaching. He has visited these
countries which have re-appeared on the map since the break-up of the
USSR and he has attempted to help them find an identity for themselves
through football.
Yesterday he pointed out: ''If you walk out into the street today in
Glasgow and ask people where Moldova is, or Belarus, or Azerbaijan, I
doubt if anyone could place them on the map.
''The quickest geography lesson there is for these nations and for the
general public is through their involvement in football. If Belarus play
against Scotland or France or Germany then people, ordinary people, will
sit up and take notice, and they will soon learn where that country is.
''It has been a terribly difficult time for them since the USSR
collapsed and the problems are enormous, but UEFA recognised that there
was a moral duty to help these people and that is what I have been
involved in doing.''
Walker's mission into the unknown -- and there is really little other
way to describe his journeys into Eastern Europe -- has had him meet not
just football leaders but also heads of state.
''It had to be that way,'' Walker reflects, ''because state aid has
been necessary to bring stadia up to the required standards, and the
various governments realise the recognition football can give them.
''When I was in Georgia and talking to President Eduard Shevernadze, I
stressed to him that if I said to someone in the West that I was going
to Georgia then nine times out of 10 they would presume I was jetting
off to Atlanta. In most minds Georgia is a state in the American south
and, to be fair, he agreed with me.
''One way, as I said earlier, to raise the level of awareness of these
'new' countries is through their participation in UEFA competitions. If
Georgia play Germany or Italy, then the public across Europe very
quickly learn about that nation, its resources and even its history.
''Shevernadze and all the other heads of state have seized on that
fact. Of course, they realise, too, that UEFA have been helping then
enormously.
''The budget set at the disposal of the Eastern European Assistance
Bureau is 3m Swiss francs per year (that is just short of #2m) and there
is additional aid available from the western countries, who offer that
in both a material way and in a technical sense.''
The wealthier football countries have helped the poverty-stricken
nations of the east with equipment, by sending administrators to help
facilitiate the re-organisation of the various national bodies, and by
offering expert advice on various issues.
One area, in particular, is the commercial side of the game, which has
become more and more important to the major footballing nations. Until
now, though, these tiny countries have had no experience of sponsorship,
of advertising or even of television fees for live showing of games.
Yesterday Walker revealed: ''One of these countries was involved in a
major game which was being shown live in Germany. They worked out a fee
for the television coverage, which also covered the trackside
advertising, and ended up receiving just $250.
''We are making sure that this kind of thing will never happen again.
They are being educated as to what would be reasonable sums in similar
situations in the future.''
The possible fee, of course, could have been a thousand times higher,
money which could have been used to develop the game at grass-roots
level or even, in the case of these small nations, helping the national
team.
Those teams have already been worrying the big guns, upsetting some of
the older, established football countries. That has given Walker some
satisfaction. He admits: ''It has been good to see that. I have welcomed
it, because I know how much work has been going into the game in these
countries.
''I believe that they appreciate what UEFA has been doing. You have to
understand that this aid has not gone to all the Eastern bloc countries.
There is no need to go to Hungary or Romania or Bulgaria where,
historically, they have had organised football for a great number of
years now.
''Our efforts have been concentrated on the former members of the
Soviet Union who have been left in a kind of vacuum. It has been a
priority for UEFA, and to see even some little success on the field of
play has shown that the work is paying off.''
As well as these duties Walker has wielded enormous influence over the
stadia improvements being carried out across Europe, and he will be an
important figure behind the scenes when the European Championships are
staged in England next year.
The 65-year-old Scot has added a detailed knowledge of the European
scene to his national credentials since leaving the SFA five years ago.
Now, as he returns, that will be brought into operation to breathe new
life into our ailing domestic game. Walker has powerful connections
across the Continent and all of them will be asked to help.
The next three years promise to be exciting and productive.
If Belarus play against Scotland, then ordinary people, will sit up
and takenotice

JIM Farry is never likely to find a place on any list of the country's
favourite people, but the public's perception of him has never troubled
the chief executive of the SFA. When his time is over he will be content
to have people scrutinise his work and be judged on its merits.
Not once has Farry been jabbed by the urge to court publicity and he
tends to be verbose enough to make most hacks think twice about
approaching him for a comment.
The modern journo is already laden down with Tandy, tape recorder, and
portable phone and if a dictionary had to be added to the equipment
package it would be necessary to cancel the taxi and hail a pack mule.
When you stop and think about it he is a much maligned creature, Farry
I mean. The chief executive positively revels in the duties of the
administrator, but that doesn't make him a bad person. In fact, the
opposite applies because Farry, who has been key holder to headquarters
since May 1990, has been diligent in his efforts to carry out his quest
which was to restructure football from the bottom to the top.
That, of course, meant his work would go largely unnoticed since most
supporters are interested only in what happens between 3pm and 5pm on
Saturdays, and to be honest not a lot has been happening between those
hours if you take away the sweaty, clenched fist endeavour of those
currently masquerading as footballers.
Someone has to be culpable for the state of Scottish football and, by
tradition, the buck stops with the head man of Bleak House. Farry is
that man, but to dismiss him without at least looking at the programmes
which have been put in place during his term in office is insulting.
Of course he can sound pompous and out of touch with the fan on the
street, but his commitment to the cause can't be faulted.
He has eased into being many ways and modes of operation which the
public wouldn't even want to know about, but Farry has also presided
over a necessary and crucial expansion of the technical department which
has various coaching courses and ideas to win back the children the game
forgot for a spell.
Significantly, there is an ever-growing team of community coaches who
are spreading the gospel like never before.
In fact, no SFA leader before Farry did as much to promote the need
for coaching and development or to fund work designed to improve the
standard of the Scottish footballer.
The appointment on Monday of an Independent Review Body for Scottish
Football can be seen as an admission that the SFA believes its own
structure to be wrong for the modern age and also that of the game in
general.
There will be crucial changes and the feeling is the SFA will not
survive in its current shape.
A number of people who have been doing little more than protecting
their own corners will become casualties of Walker's review, but Farry
shrugs his shoulders at the thought.
Clearly the wellbeing of the game is the priority and individuals are
expendable.
''About three years ago we started to look at revising the rules and
the articles of the association and every door opened eight more. Behind
these doors we found 10 more,'' Farry said, ''but we had to remember
that we were talking about the year 2000 and ask ourselves, 'where
exactly are we going?'
''I know that managers and coaches would rather be playing better
football and I have no doubt most football directors, with their hands
on their hearts, ask themselves what the hell was that all about at the
end of many of their matches.
''It has been obvious football has been going along the wrong track.''
The more the SFA's people looked at the problems, the more convinced
they became that outside help was required and Farry recommended that an
independent body be called in even though he must have been aware that
members of the public would regard Walker's return as a threat to his
own position.
''I can't change the public's perception, I can only tell the truth,''
Farry said of the review group, which should be up to strength by the
end of this month and which will make recommendations, probably every
three months, throughout a two to three year life span.
''It is the SFA's opinion that we can't wait three years to start
making changes,'' Farry said.
''Look at what has happened. English clubs are no longer buying
Scotish players and look at tghe number of foreign players in our own
game.
''Craig Brown can go to a match and watch 22 players of which perhaps
only nine are eligible to play for Scotland, and six of them are not
good enough. A little introspective analysis will not be a bad thing for
us.
''Ernie Walker has said he will appoint people of unquestionable
ability and I am especailly intrigued that he wishes to have a foreign
flavour also because we in this country have an insularity which borders
on the arrogant. Believe me, our place in world gives us no
justification for arrogance.
''An international mix is a good thing and if we have pretentions to
become Euro-crats we can't be insular.''
Listening to Farry, the impression that Walker's recommendations will
be accepted strengthens and it will be a profound disappointment if, at
the end of all of this, Scottish football has not been changed
dramatically, and for the better. Then Farry really would be culpable.
''What we have just done represents a bold step and it may even be an
uncomfortable one for some of us,'' he said. ''But it has to be done for
those who will follow us.
''In the next decade I believe we will witness major changes in our
football.''
It is the SFA's opinion that we can't wait three years to start making
changes

Ross Finlay is impressed by the Kia's good aura.
ALTHOUGH Kia Motors, the company which imports those Korean-built cars
to the UK, recently changed its logo, any newly registered Kias I have
seen retain the manufacturer's rather jocular badge. The letters K-i-a
are arranged to resemble an old-style factory, complete with smoking
chimney. In fact, like other Korean car companies, Kia has built up
impressive production facilities well away from the smoke-stack image
the badge represents.
The Korean motor industry started only in 1962, although at least two
of the manufacturers in it have ambitions to break into the world-wide
top ten by the start of the next century. During the 1960s it was just
an assembly operation, then moved towards full scale design-and-build,
thanks to imported British expertise. It tends to be under government
direction to an extent we would never accept here.
Kia was originally a bicycle maker, and is the oldest established
company in the Korean motor industry. Nevertheless, its entry occupies
exactly three lines in a 1979 motor manufacturing encyclopaedia to which
I often refer -- and even there the exact date of its first production
car is given as approximate. In the early 1980s Kia was directed to
concentrate on commercials, and it was only allowed back into car
production some years later.
Now it builds more than 600,000 cars, buses, trucks, sport utilities
and other vehicles in a year. It supplies more than a quarter of all the
vehicles sold in its home market, and its export graph shows a steep
upward trend. Mazda and Ford are minority shareholders, and so far Kia
has produced cars which are either re-worked Mazdas or based on a Mazda
platform.
The Kia Pride, which is on sale here in four different versions with
recently upgraded fuel-injection 1.3-litre engines and a choice of
three-door or five-door bodywork, is a Korean version of the original
Mazda 121, superseded in the Japanese manufa cturer's catalogue by a
more modern design. Pride prices run from #5749 to #6749, performance
and economy are par for the supermini course, and, although the high-set
body styling may look a little gawky from some angles, the point is that
the upright seating and fairly high roofline allow four adults to travel
without much cramming.
Current models have revised interiors and trim materials. The
semi-whitewall tyres which Kia used to favour seem thankfully to have
been abandoned. A van version is offered, just as competitively priced.
Also on a Mazda platform, but with its own individual Kia body style,
the Mentor is a family sized 1.6-litre saloon. Prices are #8950 or #9850
depending on trim and equipment levels, and Kia has recently started to
offer special editions, both with enhanced specifications. The LE costs
#8495 and the GLX SE comes at #10,250. So price is still an important
consideration.
Taking Kia into quite a different sector of the market, the Sportage
4x4 should be here soon, although I am rarely invited to drive Kia
models and have no idea of precisely when to expect it. The idea of the
Sportage is that it should be a leisure time four-wheel drive affair
with a two-litre twin cam engine, decent enough off-road performance,
but the kind of ride quality and saloon-style interior which might tempt
customers put off by the ruggedness of some other 4x4s.
Korean cars, of course, do not suffer from the kind of quota
restrictions which apply to the Japanese. But Kia was the first Korean
manufacturer to announce plans to assemble vehicles in Europe. Last May
it signed a contract with Karmann in Germany to produce the Sportage at
a rate intended to rise to 30,000 per year.
Back home, Korean industry observers worry about over-capacity and the
effect of any more upward revaluation of the currency. For the moment,
Korean vehicles remain keenly priced here, Kia's range is gradually
extending, and, even allowing for its European assembly programme, that
export graph may go into a still steeper climb.

GARDEN materials suited to Scottish homes can be obtained from garden
centres, DIY superstores and builders.
Scott Rae Stevenson, the builders' merchants at Eglinton Toll supplied
some of the grit and gravel on which Glasgow is built, and has a
seven-acre site with slabs, walling and coping, paviours for driveways,
bricks, gravel, sand and cement.
''Gravel is a versatile material for garden paths, being relatively
inexpensive and easily laid. Curves are easy to form, and change in
level easy accommodated,'' John Corr says. ''An added advantage is that
gravel can be taken up without difficulty and relaid if piping or other
services need to be installed. It also forms a ready-made base for other
surfaces if they should become needed. The surface requires frequent
raking, however, and you should ensure that the gravel is all one grade:
a mixture of stone sizes settles in layers and looks ugly.''
Of all the traditional paving materials, brick offers the most scope
for creative design, and paths constructed from natural flagstones make
a distinctive and decorative surface in the garden. Professional
landscaping companies will ensure that paths and patios are properly
supported on a stable, well-drained base, and restrained at the edges to
ensure that they do not move sideways. Effective drainage must be
planned from the outset to prevent sinkage and rainwater puddles
forming.
''You should know your garden fairly well before you site permanent
features like paths and patios -- see where the sun is for most of the
day, and check that patios are large enough to be genuinely useful, and
sheltered from winds,'' John advises.
The most successful garden designs are a continuation of the interior
of the house in terms of colour and style. The view will then blend
harmoniously with the decor, and please the senses. Unless you have
opted for a riot of colourful flowers, county cottage style, keep the
planting simple. Most important of all, let the garden reflect your
personality. If you like to relax and potter around in the garden, you
will be content to let a few self-sown seedlings brighten a well-groomed
gravel path.
If you have a young family, avoid ponds and keep fragile flowers to
the minimum -- have a large lawn and plant robust shrubs and trees. A
low maintenance garden with rough grass can be given a romantic,
delicate look by the inclusion of a circular seat under some shade with
a beautiful sprawling shrub rose planted nearby.

CREATING a garden is one of life's most pleasant tasks. ''If you've
just bought a new home which is surrounded by mud and rubble, or an
older house with a neglected and overgrown garden, don't dash out there
to set things straight as fast as you can,'' says horticultural
consultant John Corr, whose company specialises in recreating historic
gardens. ''Instead, wait until you have got over the immediate hassles
of moving house, then take time to savour the pleasure of planning the
garden.''
Gardens, like homes, have a tremendous variety of atmospheres and
styles. Some are instantly recognisable, such as the apparently
haphazard mix of flowers in the English cottage garden and the
restrained elegance of a Japanese garden. Some styles have specific
historical associations, showing perhaps the influence of the stepped
stone terraces of Italy, or the colourful and exotic plants which
featured strongly in Edwardian and Victorian gardens in Britain.
For large-scale examples of the ways in which exotic gardens can be
recreated in our northern climate, John suggests a visit to Inverewe
Gardens in Inverness, where acre after acre is filled with exotic
flowering shrubs, rare plants and magnificent tropical trees. Or take a
trip to Portmerion on the north coast of Wales, where a Renaissance
garden is interwoven with a small Italianate town created in the early
years of this century.
''These examples are too ambitious for the average gardener, but they
can provide a source of inspiration and there will certainly be elements
which can be adapted for the garden at home. Visits to beautiful gardens
are part of the pleasure of designing a new garden,'' John adds.
Staying within the British tradition of gardening this century,
different styles have developed as a result of regional cultures. To
create a style in your own garden, be sensitive to the scale and mood of
the surrounding landscape and buildings. A classically designed house,
whether old or new, will probably look best with a garden constructed to
a formal layout. Use the proportions between the windows and doors to
suggest the pattern made in the garden by paths, pools, terraces,
borders and lawn areas. Broad sweeps of colour and grand paths will lend
elegance to a large garden with open views, while narrow borders of
small flowers and winding paths would be lost in a large space, but
would ideally suit a small cottage garden.
Paths, patios, fencing and garden buildings should harmonise with the
house and the garden style. If it's difficult to decide what will be
appropriate, try using a process of elimination starting with the most
obviously unsuitable materials and styles -- for example, crazy paving
would not be the right choice for a Victorian town house.

THE fickle winds of teenage fashion are now blowing full force in the
direction of apre-sailing wear.
But young people are not restricting themselves to the latest ranges
of casual designer clothing from the likes of Musto and Henri Lloyd --
dressing for an exhilarating ''beat'' has taken on a whole new meaning.
Whereas it always used to mean buying the best in foulweather gear for
the wettest point of sailing, it can now involve buying a buoyancy aid
to wear to a disco.
''The young ones go for Henri Lloyd's deck coats, jib jackets,
fleeces, and rugby shirts -- all those things,'' said Iain Duncan of
Duncan Yacht Chandlers, Glasgow.
''Sailing wear is becoming more fashionable all the time with
different colours and styles every season. The basic waterproof gets
better -- more functional -- all the time but really there isn't much to
change when it comes to style. So the manufacturers have introduced
casual wear that's got some fun and some fashion to it. We have an
extensive collection from all the leading manufacturers and we don't
have the mark-up of the shops in town.''
Gone are the days when sailors could stand their oilskins in the
corner. Duncan's stock the latest in lightweight, practical and
fashionable clothing by Lloyd, Gill, Splashdown, Prorainer, and Musto,
whose revolutionary HPX range has gone down a storm since its launch
last September.
Billed as the greatest innovation to hit the sport, it owes its
technical superiority to a respected Scottish company. W L Gore and
Associates, famous the world over for Gore-Tex, partnered Musto in the
development of HPX, the first lightweight durable fabric tough enough to
take on the might of the Antarctic ocean. Closer to home, HPX technology
has been enthusiastically taken by yachtsmen looking for better
performance from their foulweather gear.
The secret ingredient is a special type of Gore-Tex membrane -- 10
times stronger than standard -- which is waterproof yet breathable,
overcoming that damp, clammy, unpleasant feeling every yachtsman is
familiar with.
Musto's genius was in putting the new fabric to work. It came up with
inner and outer fabric laminated to the Gore-Tex membrane.
HPX is light, flexible, durable, and made exclusively for Musto whose
lifetime guarantee demonstrates its confidence in the new technology;
the company is using it for a brilliant new range of foulweather
clothing -- High Performance Offshore.
Yachtsmen with extensive sea-going experience recommend that the HP
Offshore foulweather gear should be worn with Musto bodywarmer underwear
which is made from polypropylene and High-Performance Middle Layer
clothing which combines the qualities of a deep-pile insulating fabric
for warmth with a Teflon finished Pertex shell -- in other words a
complete three-layer clothing system.
Not surprisingly Musto HPX has met with a high demand. Duncan's has
limited supplies on a first come first served basis. Better step round
to 7 Scotland Street today, the store is opposite West Street
Underground station and has parking at the rear.
Sailing wear in general accounts for a substantial and growing part of
Duncan's business and there are plans to extend the clothing department
at the end of the year.
''We are trying to make the department as self-service as possible.
Customers can come in and browse -- if they want information or
assistance the staff are there to help,'' said MD Eleanor Nelson.
Sailors spend hours browsing in the chandlery section where there is
everything from copper nails to blocks and ropes to suit all sizes of
craft.
''We also stock all the navigation equipment, auto-pilots, VHF base
and hand-held radios, fishfinders, echo sounders, logs and speedometers,
and Global positioning systems which can be linked to chart plotters,''
said Iain Duncan.
Duncan's specialise in outboard engines including reliable Yamahas and
Evinrudes from 2.3 to 15hp -- larger engines can be supplied overnight
-- and inflatables by Avon and Compass.
''If you are a sailor, this is the place to come, the place where you
will be made very welcome and where you will find the widest range of
clothing, chandlery, inflatables and outboards,'' said Kenneth Rennie,
manager.

UNARGUABLY one of the finest of Arthur Miller's works. The
extraordinary thing, though, watching this transferred production from
the Bristol Old Vic is how, despite its age (it was written 40 years
ago), it still has such pulling power. Part of the reason is that Miller
has cleverly reframed old-fashioned melo-drama to his own ends.
The other is the creation of a character like Eddie Carbone, who like
Willie Lomax in Salesman is a figure of such tragic proportions -- so
culpable yet so infinitely human -- he speaks to us on a mythic level.
Miller's sympathy for this giant, flawed bull of a man -- both victim
and oppressor -- is so total, and in Bernard Hill's slowly imploding
performance so terrifyingly convincing, we are, yet again swept away.
But it is also David Thacker we have to thank. One of those most
responsible for the Miller revival in this country, Thacker's team,
including regular designer Shelagh Keegan with her haunting waterfront

whilst making us see it with entirely fresh eyes.
And what we come to see through Hill, the marvellous Charlotte
Cornwell (never better) as his rejected wife, Ivan Kaye and Joseph
Fiennes as their Italian relatives and Emer McCourt as Catherine, the

relevant about illegal immigration but about the whole ethos of the
Italian male.
On top of Miller's liberal championing of the underdog, A View from

RESTING on laurels can be a mistake. No matter whether in business,
sport or the arts, the only way to stay successful is to become even
better at what you do, and to devise a method whereby this improvement
can be measured. Hence the Donaldson &amp; Paterson decision to go for
BS5750.
''We first thought about it after one of our competitors took the same
step two years ago,'' said John Black. ''I was convinced that this was
the way forward and sat down with my daughter Paula to discuss it.
''She insisted that it had to be done, but conceded it meant a lot of
extra work for all concerned. In fact it meant more work for her than
for anyone else and there were times when it appeared all the late
nights dealing with paperwork might never end.
''Simultaneously our business was growing and this put Paula under
even more pressure. She managed it so well that when it came to the
assessment we passed first time.''
The systems are now up and running and, according to Mr Black, the
efficiency improvements are already apparent.
By never turning away an opportunity John Black is one of the few
people in the trade who can claim to have worked since leaving school
(in his case aged 15) without a spell of idleness, enforced or
otherwise.
''If it is necessary to fly to London and speak to the person in
charge of contracts for a company or authority with a presence here then
I'll do it without hesitation,'' he says.
Donaldson &amp; Paterson, he insists, wants to establish and maintain a
close working relationship with each and every client. John Black says
that to do this the work must be done to a uniformly high standard, at a
competitive price and within the set timescale.
This was one of the lessons he learned from Tom Donaldson and he
insists it has provided the company with the ability to thrive and
prosper throughout good and bad times.

ALTHOUGH it has been apparent for a number of years that streamlining
procedures, improving standards and increasing efficiency is not only
desirable but absolutely vital if businesses are to compete
successfully, not all have responded in a positive manner.
The acquisition of BS5750 is one achievement that clearly demonstrates
a commitment to better service.One of the latest to have completed the
course is Donaldson &amp; Paterson Limited, floor-covering contractors, who
celebrated the acquisition of the prized certificate by moving into new
premises in London Road Trading Estate, Glasgow.
The company has been in existence since 1971. At that time it traded
out of premises in Darnley Street, Glasgow, where it stayed until 1981.
By this time it had established a sound reputation in the trade and was
winning some significant contracts.
The original premises were now too small and a move to East Kilbride
followed. The circle was completed earlier this month with the company's
second change of location, to the newly refurbished London Road offices
and workshop.
Donaldson &amp; Paterson is now headed by managing director John Black. He
became part of the company in 1979, joining Mr Tom Donaldson in what at
that time was a fairly small operation, employing just two tradesmen.
Mr Black had been operating in the same field, but recognised that
both his own interests -- and those of Donaldson &amp; Paterson -- would be
best served by a pooling of resources.
''It was a matter of me bringing in new business and some extra
capital and using an established name to build a platform from which we
could make further progress,'' he recalled.
The move to East Kilbride helped, with the then East Kilbride
Development Corporation able to offer a range of incentives which
enabled Donaldson &amp; Paterson to successfully service existing contracts
while at the same time identifying new opportunities through a widening
circle of contacts.
''From 1979 we have enjoyed a period of steady growth,'' said John
Black. ''Turnover has increased every year and our customer list has
grown to such an extent that we are now one of the leading floor
covering contractors in the country, operating throughout Scotland and
beyond.''
Tom Donaldson retired three years ago, leaving Mr Black as the owner
of the company. The workforce has grown to 16 tradesmen and five
administrative staff, with its nucleus being provided by the Black
family.
''This has been a deliberate policy to ensure that we all work
together as a team,'' said Mr Black. ''My younger brother, Jim Black, is
now contracts director. He was brought in from another company, starting
as a working foreman and now very much my right arm. He sees virtually
every contract we have and I price everything through his eyes as it
were.
''The entire office staff is made up of family. My wife Kathleen is a
director, daughter Paula is my personal assistant, looking after all the
invoicing and cashflow matters as well as being the real driving force
behind our acquisition of BS5750.
''Paula is backed up by two nieces, Angela Rae and Kirsty Black, while
in the stores are my father and son, with nephews and people I have
known for a number of years present among the tradesmen.
It is a formula that has proved itself time and again. We have regular
meetings at which any problems are aired and solutions worked out before
anything gets to crisis point.''
Donaldson &amp; Paterson now undertakes work for a whole portfolio of blue
chip clients, ranging from Government departments and district councils
through to Strathclyde Region and the Greater Glasgow, Lanarkshire and
Argyll &amp; Clyde Health Boards.
''We have worked very hard to get where we are today,'' said John
Black. ''Much of the credit has to go to the excellent guidance handed
down over the years by Mr Donaldson who was always able to balance my
enthusiasm with sound business practice allied to a natural caution,
something that helped Donaldson &amp; Paterson to become acknowledged as
being on a rock solid foundation.''

SCOTTISH meat wholesalers have welcomed the news that the Scotch
Quality Beef and Lamb Association is to take responsibility for the farm
assured livestock scheme and urges farmers to use the licensed partner
agreements with meat plants and auctioneers to sign up for the scheme.
The Scottish Associatioon of Meat Wholesalers sees the development as
a major step forward for the meat industry to meet the increasing demand
by retailers for quality assured produce.
A spokesman said:''The case for farm assurance was always right and it
is even more right today in view of the pressures facing the meat
industry if it is to secure a lifeline for the future.''

THE Meat Hygiene Service, introduced at the start of April could cost
the Scottish meat industry an extra #700,000 a year, according to the
Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers.
It has welcomed Government assistance for meat inspection in the form
of a rebate of #2 an hour for the next six months as well as capping the
cost of veterinary inspection at #35 an hour.
However association president John Scott, Paisley, says more needs to
be done to reduce the 'crippling' additional costs on Scotland's meat
industry.
''Virtually every meat plant in Scotland faces increased costs of up
to 100% for meat inspection despite an assurance from MHS that costs
would be lower than those previously provided by local authorities.
''The industry cannot afford the level of increase being imposed.''
The SAMW is making the Secretary of State for Scotland aware of their
concern.

SCOTLAND'S landowners have initiated a new campaign to tell the public
the role they play in managing the countryside.
At the annual general meeting of the Scottish Landowners' Federation
at Bridge of Allan yesterday there were clear warnings to members that
they must do more to show that their image of the 'hunting, shooting,
fishing' playboys is out of date.
Graeme Gordon, from New Galloway, said: ''We need a better image.''
He said that landowners were accused of being vandals for planting
hostile trees when in fact they were doing their best to manage the land
for the benefit of future generations.
In his key address Morayshire farmer Mike Gibson said: ''We are
notoriously bad at presenting our case. Others with interests on what
should happen with the land seem far more capable of mustering support
and getting the upper hand in terms of public and media profile.''
He pointed out that many estates were land officially designated as
severely disadvantaged and that large farm size did give them an
advantage over European agricultural partners.
''The important thing with land is what we do with it and how we do
it. Owning land is a great responsibility and challenge from which we
hope to derive pleasure and satisfaction and even a little profit.
''Where people want to share our enjoyment of the land access, in most
cases, is not denied. But we are not custodians of a theme park and we
have to pay the bills.''
He pointed out that SLF was more active in assisting not only
landowners but rural dwellers and was greatly involved in many
environmental issues. It was involved with political and environmental
groups in examining the sustaining of Scottish agriculture and the
levels of suport required.
''We are looking for a far more integrated form of land use, truly
acknowledging the landowner's role in operating a business enterprise
within the rural environment.''
The federation has boosted its membership to 3690 but fewer than 60
attended yesterday's annual meeting.
Colin Dalrymple said there was much more action needed if landowners
were to promote their business at home and in Brussels. They needed to
be seen as working members of the rural comunity helping to provide
employment.
Graeme Gordon reminded members that field sports were an important
part of land management and generated a lot of money for the community
and a wider public should be aware of this.

SCOTCH Premier Meat's Edinburgh plant is to lead the way in Britain in
utilisng new technology that will improve the tenderness and eating
quality of lamb -- plus extend the season for the Scottish product.
Electrical stimulation of carcases, developed in New Zealand,
counteracts the shortening of the muscles after slaughter which makes
meat tougher.
Scottish Premier executive director Raymond White said: ''The
technique will be particularly important as the lamb marketing season
progresses as it will improve the quality of lamb in late season and we
hope this will persuade supermarkets and retail butchers to handle
Scotch lamb rather than New Zealand supplies.
The Edinburgh plant has increased output since opening in 1993 and 75%
of lamb carcases are exported. More than #250,000 has been invested in
improved meat handling facilities and Scotch Premier is now the largest
red meat company in Scotland with a turnover in the last year of over
#70m.

<TEXT>
WEMBLEY, operator of the sports stadium that is a mecca to English
football fans, has agreed a #116m rescue package but would still be left
with half its huge debt burden.
The refinancing includes a #62.5m fully underwritten share placing and
open offer at 2p a share, and a deal to swap some #54m of existing debt
into new ordinary shares.
But Wembley, which also confirmed chairman Sir Brian Wolfson would be
replaced by Claes Hultman, chief executive of electronics group
Eurotherm, said that even after the refinancing its net debt would be
around #72.5m.
Wolfson was not available for comment on the refinancing, but the
group's advisers, investment bank Charterhouse, said that cutting debt
any further would have diluted possible future returns to shareholders
even more.
''It was a balance between bringing debt to a level where it no longer
worried people and allowing for attractive potential returns,'' said
Charterhouse's Ian Beith.
Shares in Wembley, which had been suspended at 6 pence, immediately
fell 3-1/2p to 2-1/2p when trading restarted after the announcement.
The group ran into trouble in the 1980s as it transformed the Wembley
stadium into a broad sports and entertainment complex. At the same time,
it went on a spending spree across the leisure industry that was
financed largely from borrowings.
A rights issue in April 1992, together with a major sell-off
programme, failed to rein in debts which by summer of last year amounted
to over #150m.
The new funding, which has been widely reported to be conditional on
the stepping down of Wolfson, includes some #82.5m of new debt, and an
agreement from its lenders not to take action on the failed
debt-reduction target.
Wembley also reported results for the 1994 year, showing pretax losses
nearly halved at #35.9m. It said 1995 business was ahead of plan so far
and that it planned to offer a dividend in the first half of the 1996
year.

<HEADLINE>BBA to sell its automotive products division</HEADLINE>

BBA Group is selling its automotive products division to its
management for #181m in a move which about completes its concentration
on core activities.
The business makes brakes and clutches and includes two well known
names in the industry, AP Borg &amp; Beck and AP Lockheed.
It is also a leading supplier to motor racing, dominating Formula 1
cars in respect of brakes.
The new company will be known as Automotive Components, which harks
back to the original company which BBA took over in 1986.
The buyout is backed by venture capital provider, CINVen, which is
underwriting #65m of institutional equity investment. Morgan Grenfell
has arranged #120m of senior debt and working capital facilities and
#20m of mezzanine finance.
Under chief executive Bob Quarta, BBA is concentrating on its
businesses which have critical mass or a strong presence in specialist
markets.
The core activities are automotive friction materials used in brakes;
non-woven industrial textiles, including Duralay carpet underlay;
aviation services providing ground support for civil aircraft in the
eastern US; and specialist electrical equipment used in power
generation.
Various other disposals have already occurred, but the automotive
products sale is much the biggest. It accounts for over a fifth of BBA's
current sales.
The deal will leave BBA with net cash of #103m which it intends to use
for acquisitions within the core areas. Mr Quarta said they had nothing
immediate in mind, though there were ''considerable opportunities'' to
develop these activities internationally.
The group is particularly keen to build market share in the US for
friction materials.
Mr Quarta says the group is set to benefit from reduced costs, higher
prices and more effective capital spending. The outlook for sales is
promising and generally the group views the future with greater
confidence than it has for some years.
BBA will not totally sever connection with automotive products as
under the deal it will receive 20% of any return that CINVen sees over
its period of investment in excess of certain minimum targets.
The management buyout is led by Brian Gaunt who will be chief
executive. The company's sales will top #300m, with main customers
including Rover, Honda, Renault and Fiat. It is the principal supplier
of clutch hydraulic systems in the US to the likes of Ford, General
Motors and Chrysler.
CINVen director Richard Munton commented: ''The acquisition has been
structured to enable the new company to invest heavily in capital
equipment and research and development. Its management team will now be
able to concentrate on developing it into a significant world class
business.''

<HEADLINE>Venture capital needs drop    Dearth of major deals seen in Scotland</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978927785</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE amount of venture capital invested in Scottish companies tailed
off sharply last year because of a dearth of major deals.
Figures released by the British Venture Capital Association yesterday
reveal a 35% fall in finance provided to Scottish companies to #77m.
Scotland's share of total UK funding, which stood at 10% in 1993, halved
to 5%.
However, the number of companies receiving venture capital fell only
slightly, from 151 to 138.
The statistics reflect a lack of big deals, with figures having been
boosted during the last five years by buy-outs at the likes of
sausage-skin-maker Devro International and Invergordon Distillers.
Economic recovery also resulted in a scarcity of receivership sales
and other forced-seller situations.
Meanwhile, venture capital funding was more prevalent in other parts
of the country, with total UK investment up 35% at #1668m.
Scotland, whose venture capital providers include independents, such
as 3i, fund management groups and subsidiaries of the major clearing
banks, still has the highest proportion of venture-backed companies in
the UK.
This is a reflection of the strength of the Scottish financial
community, which probably has the greatest proportion of venture capital
providers outside London.
Scotland now has about 450 companies which have undergone management
buy-outs.
The UK is well ahead of the field, particularly continental European
countries, in the provision of venture capital.
Deals done by the Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen offices of 3i
totalled #29m during 1994. The investment capital group, which backed
46% of the Scottish companies provided with venture capital last year,
doubled its share of the funding total to 38%.
Glasgow-based director Willie Watt put the increase in market share
down to 3i's presence in the middle market, with the group heavily
involved in deals in the #3m to #10m bracket.
He also believed 3i's willingness to back new technology and growing
businesses secured it a larger slice of business.
Peter Smaill, director of NatWest Ventures in Scotland, attributed the
slowdown in management buy-outs in 1994 to unrealistic asking prices
which resulted from the high flotation values achieved last spring.
However, he added that NatWest Ventures had this year encountered one
of its busiest periods in the buy-out market since it became established
in Scotland in 1989.

<TEXT>
SHARES of international engineering and cables group BICC fell 17p to
312p yesterday on a profits warning and generally downbeat statement.
Chairman Sir Robin Biggam, told shareholders attending the AGM that
the first half results would be affected by some raw material costs
which the company was not able to pass on in the first quarter, and by a
high level of rationalisation costs.
Sir Robin said, ''In cables, orders are continuing to show progress
but the main task in the early part of the year has been to secure the
selling price increases required to cover the recent escalation of raw
material costs.
These increases have now been secured in our major markets but there
was some under recovery in the first quarter of the year.
This factor together with the high level of rationalisation costs will
affect profits in the first half year. The second half should see the
benefit of increasing cables volumes and the full affect of the recent
price increases.''
He told the meeting that the full impact on working capital of
increased raw material prices has now been experienced and, as a result,
debt levels are significantly higher than the same period last year.
However, the group is making progress in reducing property interests
with some #30m realised so far in 1995.
Earlier, the chairman said that the trading performance of the
company's core business of cables and construction continued to be
mixed.
In construction, he said, the recent financial results of the major UK
contractors demonstrate the problems facing the industry.
The UK market continues to be highly competitive and pressure on
margins shows no sign of abating. ''The benefits to Balfour Beatty and
our growing portfolio of major overseas contracts and the major role we
hope to play in the UK government's private finance initiative will only
accrue over a period of years,'' said Sir Robin.
He added, ''In the short term, the weakness in the UK construction
market will continue and will further test Balfour Beatty's proven
resilience and competitiveness.''

TIE Rack's growing international presence has meant that in its last
financial year to January 31 shops overseas outnumbered those in the UK
for the first time.
It was mainly Continental Europe which made the running for the
specialist retailer, whose profits before tax grew 11% from #6.7m to
#7.4m on group sales 7% ahead at #83.9m. UK sales rose 3% while overseas
there was a 14% increase, making up 41% of total group sales.
At home profits were marginally up at the operating level from #5.7m
to #5.8m while Continental Europe and Eire advanced from #1.95m to
#2.69m. Asia Pacific was slightly higher at #556,000, and US losses were
reduced from #482,000 to #419,000 as unprofitable shops were closed and
airport shops opened.
The dividend is lifted 29% from 1.75p to to 2.25p, reflecting both the
company's profits advance and its strong financial position. The market
appreciated this and the shares firmed 2p to 112p.
Chairman Roy Bishko reports that trading during the first two months
of the current financial year has generally been satisfactory.
''With the wide geographic spread of operations, including a growing
airport representation and very healthy financial position, the group is
well placed to make sound progress in this and future years.''
At the beginning of December Tie Rack celebrated its tenth year in
airport retailing at Glasgow. It was the first airport site opened by
the company with the backing of BAA.
Since then the number of airport sites has grown to 38 in 23 airports
in 12 countries. Thirteen of them were opened last year in 11 airports,
and airport development remains a priority for the company.
The drop in sales growth in the UK to a lower rate than in recent
years reflected reduced opportunities for shop openings in what is Tie
Rack's most mature market. Sales of seasonal products were also
adversely affected by the mild winter, and the hot summer resulted in
reduced demand generally.
There was also a shift in the product mix away from high value silk
clothing. This has been a successful product area in the past two years
but, in anticipation of reduced demand and EC silk quota restrictions
which forced changes in sources of supply and gave rise to some delivery
problems, purchases were reduced.
However, lower sales here masked good growth in ties and scarves and
increased customer flow. Conditions for retailers were difficult and the
small increase in profits reflected good contributions from new shops,
maintained margins and strict control of costs.
For the future Tie Rack expects to open between 30 and 50 new stores a
year and sees Continental Europe as its key growth area. There are no
shops in Italy at present and it is looking there as one area of
possible expansion.
The company boasts a strong balance sheet. During the year net cash
balances increased 21% to #13.5m.

IT started as a game. The game is now a #130,000 turnover-a-year mail
order fantasy football business and its youthful founder named as
Strathclyde's most dynamic entrepeneur.
Mr Andrew McLennan, 24, was singled out from five Strathclyde
businesses, run by people under 25, as the winner of the regional heat
of the national industry-sponsored Livewire awards.
He wins #1500 and a PR contract and will join the other Strathclyde
finalists and winners from across the country at the Scottish final in
Aberdeen next week.
Enjoying his moment of glory at Strathclyde's Business Development
headquarters in Glasgow, Mr McLennan described how his business, TBA
Games of Kilmarnock, developed from a childhood hobby to a company with
thousands of customers across the UK and abroad.
The idea is simple. Subscribers, for a nominal sum, can play football
by mail. Without the ordeal of having to run around a football pitch,
players decide on team formations and tactics, arrange transfers and
hire and fire managers by post. The information is fed into a computer
and winners mailed a trophy.
After studying mechanical engineering at Strathclyde University, Mr
McLellan decided to avoid the scramble onto the career ladder and
instead joined his elder brother, Derek, in turning an interest in
fantasy war and football games into play-by-mail money spinner.
He said his company catered for around 2000 football enthusiasts,
including a squad of Greek aficionados, since being set up in January
and employs six staff.
Praising the initiative shown by the hundreds of Scottish entrants,
Garrath Le Sueur, director of Strathclyde Business Development, said Mr
McLellan was a good example of someone who had moved confidently into
the fast track to develop a successful consumer business.
He said in the 11 years since the Shell-sponsored competition began,
Scots had been proportionally better represented than other UK entrants.
However, he went on to highlight a wider concern that young people, and
graduates in particular, appeared to be reluctant to run their own
businesses. He said it was vital to the Scottish economy that young
entrepeneurs were given every encouragement.
The other Strathclyde finalists were John Lippiat who runs a mobile
phone company in Motherwell; Gideo Robinson, a cabinetmaker from
Clydebank; Willam Docherty and Solomon Sammy who run a software company
in Cumbernauld; John Shiveral, Russell Sneddon and Andrew McKelvie who
run an IT company in Greenock and Glasgow computer specialists Charles
Kerr and his business partner James Chambers.

1994. It achieved a 5% increase in net profits to SwF195m (#106m) on
sales of SwF6038m (#3281m) last year but was hard hit by dollar
weakness.
Sulzer also expects slightly higher operating income and an above
market average sales increase at its Sulzermedica division. This
includes the Glasgow based Vascutec cardiovascular prostheses --
artificial blood vessels -- which because of new products will remain
competitive in future. It achieved a modest rise in sales in a depressed
market in 1994.

MARKS &amp; Spencer supplier Dewhirst Group is booming on the back of the
success of its major customer, with profits climbing sharply as sales
volume expanded.
Turnover for 1994 was up 15% at #247m and with margins widening from
4.5% to 6.7%, profits jumped by 77% to #17m. Dividends go up from 1.45p
to 2.65p.
Dewhirst spends heavily on capital investment and this is paying off.
In ladieswear it has improved efficiency and reduced overheads, pushing
sales up 29%.
Major new investments have been made in automated cutting and
computerised handling systems, with further investment in computer aided
design, where the group reckons it leads the field in embroidery design.
A new tailoring plant came into operation and a trouser factory has
been acquired. Menswear sales were up 16%, yielding a big increase in
profits. Most of the sales growth came in trousers and shirts. Suits
were a difficult market, though sales were also ahead.
Major developments are underway in suit manufacturing and Dewhirst
reckons it is ahead of the field in ''wrinkle free'' technology. Cost
savings have been achieved on raw material procurement.
The group has diversified out of clothes to produce toiletries for M&amp;S
but the performance here was more modest, with profits up 9% at #1.86m.
The division has been restructured to give better focus on particular
markets.
Strong cash flow supports the high level of capital spending and net
cash has more than doubled to #19.7m. Dewhirst shares gained 2p to
142[1/2]p, where they sell at 16 times earnings.

IT SAYS much for Tesco's self confidence that chairman Sir Ian
MacLaurin could afford to be tetchy when asked whether he was now
Britain's largest food retailer.
Depending upon which marketing organisation one chooses, it does
appear that it is virtually level pegging with J Sainsbury, and with a
current momentum which may resolve the question over the next six
months.
In the last two or three years, through a combination of management
skills and a bit of luck including last September's #250m purchase of Wm
Low, Tesco has been able to grow market share faster than its main
rivals.
The core business excluding Low now has a market presence of around
11.4%. In Scotland where the 57 new stores have been brought into the
group there has been an increase from the original 7.1% to 13.7% at the
time of the deal to the current 14.9%.
The transformation in the subsidiary's fortunes from a like for like
sales decline of 6% at the time of the takeover to now 20% like for like
gain owes something to the better pricing policy, the overall
improvement in the product range and the willingness to support the
stores from the centre.
The total cost of the Low integration is higher than expected at
around #39m including #9m for redundancy with 230 people leaving the
Dundee headquarters.
Tesco finance director David Reid said that considerable efforts had
been made to find job with some 95 obtaining new employment.
Group pre-tax profits rose 12.7% to #595m although a more conservative
approach would be the 26.7% increase to #551m. That includes the costs
of integrating Low as well as the property losses which have been
reduced from #93m to #5m.
Turnover overall increased 17.6% to #10.9bn with the core business up
12.9%. The pace of inflation increased to 2.6% in the second half and
the expectation is it will hold at this level in 1995.
Volume growth decreased slightly during the year from the interim 2.5%
to 1.9% but overall like for like sales increased 4.3%. However since
the #5m launch of Clubcard some seven weeks ago, there has been a near
explosion in turnover which has been described as ''probably our best
ever performance.''
The card offers a 1% discount as well as fringe benefits while giving
Tesco a database on five million customers -- a huge marketing advantage
in targeting customers. Like for like sales have now leapt ahead 7% and,
encouragingly, there are growing signs of customers trading up although
that may not be sufficient to prevent a slight fall in the gross margin
over the next year.
Operating margins improved 0.2% to 6.3% because of increased
productivity and wage control including the savings from the 800
administrative redundancies.
Argyll's Safeway has also started its own loyalty card although on a
much more low key level. But Sainsbury has apparently turned its face
decisively against such a development -- at least for the present.
The other highly successful marketing ploys have been Value Line and
New Deal which have been useful generators of foot traffic and also in
holding off the attacks by the discounters.
Their price advantage does appear in any case to be diminishing.
Tesco is complaining bitterly about the increasingly restrictive
attitude towards planning permissions and that the Government's
''negative attitude to out of town store development'' is seriously
flawed.
But at the same time it is cutting the capital cost of new
developments by about 30% from those seen in the boom years of 1991 when
it and Sainsbury as well as Argyll were launching megastores costing up
to #30m each to a more cautious and less demanding level by 1997.
It has lost about #1.5m on average on projects which have had to be
abandoned.
But capital expenditure remained high last year, reducing only
marginally from #779m to #753m with around #600m-#650m in mind this time
round, including openings at Dunblane and Falkirk.
The European expansion with Catteau in France and in Hungary has seen
some improvement in the French operation. It seems certain that Tesco
will use it as a vehicle for making acquisitions over the next two or
three years -- although it ruled out any move in the short term.
The dividend total has been raised 11% to 8.6p with a 5.9p final for a
4% yield with the shares at 271p -- the staff bonus averages about #400
for the 61,000 emoloyees.
With the prospect of profits this year reaching #620m, after allowing
for the staff bonus costs, the stock is trading at just over 12[1/2]
times likely earnings. It may not do too much in terms of absolute share
price performance but it should be the best of the major food retailers.

THERE are no pointers to recovery in the Scottish housing market in
the latest figures from Halifax Building Society, which admits its 1995
house price inflation forecast may be a little optimistic.
The feel-good factor remains elusive, with fears of further interest
rate rises, this month's cut in mortgage interest tax relief, and a
reduction in income support for homeowners who encounter difficulties
all taking their toll.
These specific factors seem to be preventing the general economic
recovery from feeding through into the housing market.
House prices in Scotland fell an unadjusted 0.7% during the
characteristically weak first quarter, according to the Halifax's latest
indices. However, they were also 0.3% lower than in the first quarter of
1994.
Scotland escaped the worst of the ravages of the recession-induced
property slump, which hit the south-east of England particularly hard.
However, with the first-quarter setback following a 2% unadjusted
decline in house prices in the last three months of 1994, Scotland's
annual inflation rate went negative for the first time since mid-1993.
Halifax Building Society has been forecasting a rise of between 2% and
3% in UK house prices this year.
It had been expecting a fairly flat first-half anyway but admits that
-- unless consumer confidence re-emerges to boost the number of
transactions in the second six months -- its current prediction may be
on the high side.
General manager for Scotland Mike Provan said: ''The key requirement
is consumer confidence and we are unlikely to see any significant
movement in house prices over the next year, given some lack of
confidence and the clear intention of the Government to reduce support
for home ownership.''
Taking the UK as a whole, house prices fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2%
during March, after a rise of the same magnitude the previous month.
House prices fell 1.5% in the year to March. The negative annual
inflation rate in February was 1.1%.
Comparing the first-quarter as a whole with the same three months of
1994, UK house prices were 1.0% lower.
Average house prices in the UK have been virtually static over the
past two years and have fallen about 9% since 1990. However, they are
still nearly 80% higher than 10 years ago.
Returning to Scotland, the main growth in prices relates to new
properties purchased by first-time buyers. The price of second-hand
houses, particularly those bought by people who were already homeowners,
fell.

INVESTMENT management group Martin Currie is opening an office in the
US next month -- its first outside Edinburgh.
So far this year, the group has won new business worth more than $500m
(#313m) in the States, from five new client accounts.
Funds which have recently taken Martin Currie's North American assets
under management above $1700m (#1066m) include the international equity
portfolios of Maine State Retirement System and the New Jersey-based
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
Up until now, the group has employed a private partnership in the
States in its dealings with US financial institutions and consultancies.
However, Martin Currie, which in 1978 became one of the first Scottish
investment managers to be registered with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission, is now following the lead of Scottish peers which have set
up offices in the States.
Steve Johnson, formerly with New York-based stockbroker Neuberger &amp;
Berman, becomes vice-president of Martin Currie's US operation and will
head the two-man Connecticut office.

EUROTUNNEL shares plunged another 32p to 186p as the somewhat
hysterical reaction to co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton's statement of
the obvious continued.
There is no chance of any call on shareholders -- likewise of a fixed
interest issue being acceptable with existing Eurotunnel paper trading
at below 60%.
There may be a debt for equity swap. But why should shareholders be
diluted given the #8000m of bank debt? Sir Alastair is on top as the
banks could only lose if they pulled the plug -- and he usually wins,
even if messily. Is there a time to buy on the horizon?

TRADING conditions in the UK construction industry remain highly
competitive, and so it is not surprising that companies are seeking to
spread their business activities into other areas where the growth
prospects and margins are better.
Tarmac is one such company, along with Amey, which is building up a
sizeable presence in facilities management with a portfolio that
includes prisons and NHS Trust hospitals. These companies are benefiting
from the switch of various maintenance contracts from the public to the
private sector.
The professional fees earned from such activity act as a welcome
buffer to the cyclical nature of more traditional building and
construction revenue. Strong growth in its facilities management
business helped Tarmac to return to the black last year making profits
of #107.2m before tax compared with a pre-tax loss of #43.1m in 1993.
This is the first time in four years that profits have topped #100m
and, according to chairman Sir John Banham, reflects ''a very solid
improvement in our operating performance''. However, with a view to
building dividend cover up to two times earnings, the annual dividend
was held at 5.5p after a maintained final dividend of 2.5p.
Construction profits slipped by #2.8m to #18m. Road building remains a
problem area although Tarmac says that it is not as bad as had been
forecast because of the continuing demand for maintenance. It has high
hopes for the Government's private finance initiative in which it is
bidding for contracts for two of the four roadschemes.
Within building there was a strong recovery in volume and margins
enabling operating profits to more than treble to #14.6m. There were
price increases of 6% to 10% in building materials enabling Tarmac to go
some way towards rebuilding its margins. Brick and block prices rose by
even more, but are still well below the peak levels seen in the boom
years of 1989.
Housing activity remained depressed with Tarmac missing the boat last
year but remedial action taken in prior years enabled operating profits
to increase by almost #6m to #61.1m. It failed to have sufficient houses
ready for sale in the first half when demand was recovering. By the
second half the housing market had slowed down and has still to show
signs of any markd recovery.
Tarmac failed to reach its target of building 6500 to 7000 houses last
year. The company currently has a total of 15,721 plots at an average
price of #18,590. A further 30 sites will be available this year taking
the total to over 160, but the company is unwilling to get its fingers
burnt again in the housing market and has steadily reduced its capital
commitment to housing.
Irrespective of any upturn in the housing market, Tarmac is confident
that it can make further progress in the current financial year. Chief
executive Neville Simms said that overall the group had ''a varied
outlook'' but with some genuine signs of improvement. However, much of
the progress is expected to be skewed towards the second half. Overseas
activities in Florida, northern France and Hong Kong are expected to
continue to increase their contribution to group results.
As one of the UK's largest housebuilders Tarmac shares have been out
of favour but if and when housing activity does recover then so should
Tarmac's shares. Some analysts believe the shares have been oversold
given its fundamental value. Yesterday theshares to slipped 3p to 113p
where they yield 6.1%.

There is more than one way that justice can be done, as Andrew Lothian
describes.
ASK most people to name a judge and they will say Jeffries. Well, it's
been a long time since the Bloody Assizes, but this may be a tribute to
the fact that, with a few exceptions, modern judges are inclined to keep
a low profile and it is doubtful if many outside the profession could
even name the last six Lords President, much less say what they were
well-known for.
In this spirit, it will not be much of a surprise if many people
reading this fail to recognise the name of Lord Justice Clerk Thomson,
even though for the 15 years before his death in 1962 he held office
with a distinction that has led to his judgments being accorded a
respect paid to few of his contemporaries.
On his death, Lord President Clyde wrote of him: ''His modesty and
self-effacement made him conceal his very real grasp of principle
beneath a direct simple down-to-earth approach through which glinted at
intervals that pawky sense of humour which blossomed into full bloom
when he made an after-dinner speech.''
The reason that Lord Thomson has come to mind will, I trust, become
clear in due course. But first, let us hear the voice, from the case of
Gillespie v McMillan, where he discussed proof by way of related pieces
of evidence coming together so as to form either a chain or a jigsaw.
''By relying on the disparate qualities of space and time the logician
can prove that in a race the hare can never overtake the tortoise. But
law is a practical affair and has to approach the problem in a mundane
commonsense way. We cannot always expect to have a tidy and
inter-related picture: in real life a surrealist element is apt to creep
in and the picture, though untidy and unharmonious, may be a picture all
the same.''
The same tone of imaginative common sense is to be heard in the
following words which may be of particular value at a time when there is
a tendency for law reform to follow perhaps too closely on the heels of
what is perceived to be an undesirable outcome in a high-profile case.
''It is not from causes celebres but from the conscientious everyday
work of the court and its practitioners that the law must derive its
strength and vitality.''
The reason that this particular judge comes to mind today is that it
is in one of his judgments, in the case of Thompson v Glasgow
Corporation, that there is to be found the classic definition on the
non-interventionist judge. Now, when there is pressure on all sides for
a pro-active judiciary, it may be worth having a quick look at what the
position was in the good old days.
A certain Mrs Thompson had suffered a very serious injury in an
accident, her hand being caught in a drying machine in a corporation
wash-house. Unfortunately, the case as pleaded prior to the proof was
not supported by the evidence later given. After one judge decided that
her case had failed, an appeal was taken on her behalf. An effort was
made by her lawyers to persuade three appeal judges to allow the claim
to be altered to fit the facts as they had emerged, it being now
considered that the defenders were still at fault, though for a
different reason.
The appeal court refused to sanction any such alteration as too much
too late, and in so doing later received the support of the House of
Lords. It did not matter that justice, in the broader sense, seemed to
favour what was proposed: the court held that to allow a new case to be
made would be unfair on the defenders, who in law at the time of proof
had been required to do no more than resist the case as originally laid
against them.
This is how the Lord Justice Clerk put it: ''Each party is guided by
professional advisers whose duty is to do their best by the exercise of
diligence, skill, and judgment to win the fight, by defeating the enemy
and deploying their own resources in the most telling way according to
the exigencies of the struggle. The judge is there to see that the
struggle is conducted according to the rules and to decide the winner.''
He went on to say: ''The present rules as regards amendment were
intended to put an end to rigidity and formality. They were not intended
as a cloak for laziness, ignorance, and incompetence.''
This, one might think, is fighting talk in anyone's language, but of
course the judge was only stating what he thought the law to be. What
seems to be at the bottom of this highly adversarial philosophy is the
idea that two well-matched champions in combat will produce a result
that is correct in law and in that way justice will be done.
If one of the combatants turns out to be less of a fighter than his
opponent, then that is just hard luck on the person he represents;
certainly it is not up to the judge to get in a few telling blows on
behalf of the weaker side.
It is this approach that has increasingly, and for obvious reasons,
come under fire. Sheriffs are now bound to try to make sure both sides
put their cards on the table as soon as possible, in an effort to find
out what is really in dispute in a civil action.
It is thought that this may help a bit, but it is probable that those
such as Lord Gill, the most recent judge to speak out on the perceived
deficiencies of our civil proceedings, may be interested in reforms that
are rather more far-reaching.
Certainly, when first confronted in the mid-sixties with the
relentlessly legalistic approach of the courts to damages claims, I
found it difficult to envisage any system short of trial by ordeal more
likely to deny justice, especially to pursuers.
Senior counsel for Mrs Thompson was Gordon Stott QC and there are a
couple of interesting footnotes to be found to the case in his ''Lord
Advocate's Diary'' (AUP 1991). First, how did Lord Thomson feel about
the view of the law that he was compelled to take? Apparently Manuel
Kissen QC, Stott's opponent, thought the remark about incompetent
lawyers unfair and unlike Lord Thomson. To this the diarist adds: ''I
dare say he had a bad conscience about giving what he must have known to
be an unjust judgment.''
The second matter could not be put more clearly than by this entry for
December 26, 1961. ''It occurred to me that as I had had a good year it
might be a nice idea to give #500 to Mrs Thompson, who had her arm taken
off in the spin drier, as some compensation for having failed to get any
damages for her. I wrote her right away, and posted off the letter with
a cheque for #500.'' It seems that after all there is more than one way
that justice, or something like it, can be done.

EARS are still ringing after the week when the lions roared. Some BBC
types were no doubt piqued by the cheek of these Court of Session
ingrates. It was the corporation after all, that graced them with the
honour as the first working judges to be beamed into everyone's living
room.
Press reaction was mixed, ranging from ''Jock Beaks Bash Beeb'' (Scots
Law Times), ''Scotch Abernethy takes the Biscuit'' (Grocer's Weekly),
and ''Interesting judicial intervention enlightens broadcast guidelines
obfuscation'' (Sun). London newsdesks woke up quickly to the importance
of the story, although the usual misunderstandings about the Scottish
legal system surfaced. Some assumed that it would automatically come to
a proper court (ie in England) until the Appeal Court judges squashed
that notion by refusing leave to appeal to the Lords.
TB not BCG
BUT it was a night for gremlins in other news pages. Across the city,
as the judges were sitting, Edinburgh was honouring its greatest
physician, Sir John Crofton, for developing the world's first 100%
effective cure for TB, using three antibiotic drugs. The normally
reliable Guardian had him as discovering the BCG vaccine.
In his address, Sir John called for a more rational approach to crime
and its causes rather than the simplistic baying of the politicians and
press. There was much excellent research in the universities and the
Home Office. ''The trouble is that Ministers take little notice of it,''
he observed. Sir John is giving part of the #5000 Edinburgh Medal prize
to the Scottish Howard League. Not to be confused with the Howard League
for Penal Servitude (prop M Howard).
Kiss me QC
THE interdict case showed that a lawyer's appearance can instil his
clients with supreme confidence. According to the Daily Mail Scottish
Labour Party General Secretary Jack McConnell knew he would persuade the
courts to ban the John Major interview the minute he set eyes on Mr
Andrew Hardie QC, the leader of the Scottish Bar. The Mail's article
said: ''It was the impressive frame of the next man to shake Mr
McConnell's hand that gave him that winning feeling -- Donald (sic)
Hardie QC, the Dean of the Faculty of Advocates.''
In loco majoris
BEING deprived of the pulsating excitement of a John Major interview
led us to ponder what the BBC might show in its place. In putting out an
old edition of Panorama, the BBC must be castigated for a woeful lack of
imagination. Surely the unruly and impertinent Scots could have been
punished much more effectively by transmitting ''Highlights of the 1966
World Cup Final -- a trip down memory lane with Kenneth Wolstenholme.''
Or how about ''At Home with Brian Moore, England's unhappy hooker.'' Or
why not a rerun of the recent This is Your Life featuring Jimmy Hill?
Closed doors
WITH three Court of Session judges being summoned from the comfort of
their armchairs to hear the Panorama appeal at 9pm, you might be
forgiven for not noticing that the supreme civil court in Scotland is
actually on vacation for a month.
The only thing is that it's not officially called a vacation any
longer, because the word gives the false impression that the court
closes its doors and our judges sit around for a month not doing very
much. What used to be the vacation court, where a judge sits to hear
urgent cases, has been renamed the recess court and lawyers are uttering
phrases such as ''non-term time.'' The watchword in Parliament House is
whatever you do, don't mention the vacation.
Long lifer
ONE recent visitor to the Parliament House building is more concerned
about long-term than non-term. In anticipation of his likely
incarceration he decided to buy a radio to alleviate the boredom. By
purchasing long-life batteries he also gauged with some accuracy that he
would be a guest of Her Majesty for a considerable period of time; eight
years as it turned out.
If they last for the duration of his sentence perhaps one of the
battery companies will be interested in an advertising campaign.
Duracell seems the most likely candidate.
Cheese blues
CONCERN has been expressed about the fate of 528 kilos of Mr Humphrey
Errington's fabled Lanark Blue cheese, a delicacy apparently favoured by
the Queen. A justice of the peace ruled that the cheese was unfit for
human consumption because some samples contained the listeria bacteria
and ordered it to be destroyed. Before it could be bulldozed into the
ground, however, Lord Abernethy granted a stay of execution at the Court
of Session pending a judicial review of the magistrate's decision.
No doubt the cheese is maturing ripely in the meantime. It has been
suggested rather unkindly that gastronomic advocate Donald MacLeod,
somewhat of a legend at his own lunch table, could provide an
alternative solution to the disposal of the Lanark Blue, if it were to
be delivered along with a couple of bread vans to furnish him with a
small snack.

WE stand before you this morning armed with the simple sword of truth,
the trusty shield of British fair play, and a question: has no-one yet
noticed that Jonathan Aitken's melodramatic presentation of himself as a
paladin itching to strike down the slavering Guardian dragon was a clear
allusion, conscious or otherwise, to the little St George figure long
favoured as a logo by the Express group?
Aitken, as some of you might know, is one of the Beaverbrook boys,
part of that family which did so much to raise the standards of the
British press to their present lofty eminence. Indeed -- and isn't
history droll? -- it was of Jonathan's grandfather, the first Aitken,
that Stanley Baldwin said: ''What the proprietorship of these papers is
aiming at is power, but power without responsibility -- the prerogative
of the harlot throughout the ages.''
All this was before the Express became utterly slavish towards the
Tory Party, of course, but this is probably no time to be mentioning
harlots of any description, never mind cartoon characters.
Mum knows best
LET US turn, instead, to what we know best: journalism bent and
twisted like one of Uri Geller's spoons. Our fight begins today, ladies
and gentlemen, and we are armed with a fully-automatic, self-loading,
medium-calibre, recoilless paragraph, complete with end-user
certificates and just ideal for the export market.
Whatever the swirl of controversy around Mark Thatcher -- once known
as ''Fog'' for his similarity to things thick and wet -- his dear old
mum has always stood by the boy. Cancerous journalism could mutate where
it wished; cads (one Jonathan Aitken, in fact) could jilt poor Carol;
deserts could swallow the boy up; allegations would come and go like
failed accountancy exams; but the She Elephant would stand firm.
Given that a new biography has certain harsh and pointed things to say
about Mark's business dealings, therefore, and on the principle that
mother knows best, we offer this recent passage from a Press Association
report: ''Pictures of Lady Thatcher emerging from her London home today
show her looking gaunt and even slightly haggard, as though bound up
with anxiety. Some of her acquaintances say she has outwardly aged
enormously over the past six to nine months. It is known that she has
been deeply concerned about the media spotlight which has been focusing
without mercy for months on Mark's business activities and allegations
of her own involvement, however unwitting, in them.''
For our part, of course, we believe not a single word of it. Then
again, we never do.
* EQUALLY, we don't want to go on about this (omnes: oh yes, we do)
but was Tory Party chairman Jeremy Hanley displaying his well-known gift
of the gaffe when he told a press conference yesterday that it would be
wrong if, every time a journalist wrote a story that was untrue, a
Minister had to resign to defend himself? ''That would mean that the
make-up of the Government would be in your hands instead of the Prime
Minister's,'' Hanley told representatives of the Sun, the Mail, the
Express, the Star, the Telegraph, the Times . . .
Front-page splash
PERHAPS, rather than smiting the Guardian with his mighty sword, Mr
Aitken could demand retribution of a Peruvian sort. Over in Lima, a
group of journalistic ruffians vowed to bathe in public if Alberto
Fujimori won a new term as President.
On Sunday the hacks thought they were home and dry; on Monday, they
were up to their necks in it. Historians of the ducking stool will be
pleased to hear that all seven managed to stay afloat.
Dole isn't working
AT 71, Bob Dole shows no loss of appetite for what passes in America
for politics. This week, in fact, he announced that he is making his
third attempt to secure the Republican nomination for the presidency.
Good for him, though we can't help but feel he has a few
presentational problems to iron out if photographs taken at one of his
New York rallies are anything to go by. Or is ''Vote for Dole'' now an
election-winning slogan?
Disposable ditties
IT'S probably not something you need to know, but A R Ammons has long
been among our least favourite American poets, not to mention one of the
good reasons why no-one reads verse anymore. His gimmick, if that's the
word, is to compose, and that isn't the word, his homespun poems on
reels of adding machine paper.
A R's poems, about nothing in particular and everything in general,
are therefore not so much long as endless. They go on and on and on --
and then they go on and on again. One of this Diary's few claims to fame
is that it once attempted to read an entire Ammons poem for a bet, and
lost.
For that reason and no other we are pleased to see that old A R has a
new volume out. It's called, with touching frankness, Garbage.
Hopping mad
WE HAD thought to bring you an Easter message this morning, but since
it would probably involve nothing more spiritually useful than a guide
to the better chocolate eggs, we leave the job to the New Yorker.
That venerable mag is in a spot of bother over its latest issue.
Given that the day after Good Friday also happens to be the deadline
for Americans to fill out their income tax returns, editors thought a
cover drawing of the Easter Bunny crucified on an IRS tax form might
raise a few laughs.
Not so. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights regards the
whole business as insulting to Christians, though whether it's the white
rabbit or the IRS they're defending, no-one is entirely clear.
Pulitzer Prize-winner Art Spiegelman, who drew the picture, has a
simple answer. ''I don't,'' he says, ''believe in the Easter Bunny.''
This may be why one report has described the whole affair as a row
over ''crucifiction''.

WHEN a Red Indian wants the Kelvingrove Museum to hand back a holy
shirt, he plays on our heartstrings like this: ''Our history is like
yours. You had your massacre in a glen, ours was in a creek. You had the
Highland Clearances, we lost our land.''
In a sense what he had to say was music to Scottish ears, though not
perhaps to the ears of the museum's curators. While this country loves
the euphoria of victory, preferably spiced with a bit of massacre, the
chance to enjoy it comes along dismayingly seldom. The next best thing
is the conviction of being victimised. It means the other fellow has not
deserved to win. So if he has, he still owes us something, and he should
hand it back.
Unfortunately, the second feeling has been much more readily available
than the first. Industrial closures are still regarded not as an
opportunity to put resources to better use, but as an occasion for
demanding more subsidies. Popular sentiment and song connect this
straight back to the Highland Clearances, and to Scotland as the eternal
victim.
It makes for some strange double standards. I once stood at Bettyhill,
at the foot of Strathnaver, where the Duke of Sutherland dumped the
crofters he had evicted up the glen. But I reflected that they had not
been shifted further away from their old homes than those denizens of
the teeming tenements of Glasgow moved out to peripheral housing schemes
150 years later.
The two clearances had other things in common. Though meant to cure
intolerable conditions, they were not voluntary on the part of the
people moved. All the same, the movers insisted that their own good
intentions should prevail. And in the end, the business turned sour: the
crofters could not earn a living from kelp or fish, and the tenants of
the schemes found themselves imprisoned in ghettoes of deprivation.
While socialist corporations are excused for having got a few planning
details wrong, nobody gives the duke and his like any credit for good
intentions. People still say they were wicked Tories, acting as wicked
Tories can only be expected to act. Actually most were Liberals,
Sutherland himself being quite a radical by the standards of the day,
and contemporary Tories disliked what he did. What those Liberals were
engaged in was social engineering -- putting the world to rights -- in
the same spirit as the planners of our own time, and with one of the
same instruments, their power as landlords.
The deep Scottish urge to feel victimised produces the historical
distortion but, oddly, does not shake the faith in social engineering.
In reality, the good intentions of the left have been the bane of the
Highlands, as of Scotland generally. Even the Massacre of Glencoe was in
one way, after all, merely an attempt to create a Tory-free zone.
Good intentions are still going wrong today. The Highlands contain two
examples of non-viable or scarcely viable economic organisation. One is
the vast, unprofitable estate, like Knoydart or Eigg, which passes
hopelessly from one hand unable to make anything of it to another. I add
hastily that I wish Professor Eckhard Muruma every success in his
insular philanthropy, but note that he is treading a stony path where
many have stumbled before.
The other is the croft -- frozen in time by well-meaning legislation
of 1886. Only rarely is it possible to survive from a croft. Some
crofters get round that by poaching salmon, ripping off tourists and so
on. Others play the system in more subtle ways. I number three crofters
among my personal acquaintances. All are prosperous professionals in
Edinburgh who get a friend or relation to keep up the old place and use
it as a holiday home.
Only if they flagrantly neglected it could they be thrown out, and
they are not so foolish. On the contrary, they are successful operators
in one set-up which does realise the Scottish ideal of attaching
yourself to a suitable group of victims and living a life of Riley ever
after. It scarcely matters that the stated aim of the legislation, to
maintain crofting communities, is not fulfilled.
That the legislation has always failed and is still failing should be
clear from the merest glance. The late Historiographer Royal, Professor
Gordon Donaldson, whose family hailed from Shetland, used to point out
that more people had left the Highlands since 1886 than before. He liked
to name crofting townships still populated when he was a boy, but
deserted now. That, if anything, understated the problem because there
are many others, where crofters could not or would not live, which white
settlers have taken over instead.
It has been hard to find a way through all this while two Highland
hordes stayed in their trenches and sniped at each other. On one side
were the lairds with their rights to private property. On the other were
the socialists, self-appointed champions of the victims, calling for
nationalisation of the land and similar fabulous nonsenses (I wonder how
this squares now with the repeal of Clause IV).
Neither saw that the consequences of social engineering in the past
prevented an obvious solution which a freer market might have brought
about -- the formation of viable economic units. Obvious solutions may
be more easily preached than practised. But there is one prime instance,
in the Assynt crofters who have bought their own land and who now work
together to develop it, by all accounts with good results so far.
In time some will succeed and some will fail, some will stay and some
will go; the market can see to this. But they have all the greater
chance of succeeding and staying because they no longer wallow in the
status of victims. They have taken responsibility for themselves, to set
an example which the rest of the Highlands, and the rest of Scotland,
would do well to follow.

FIFTY years ago today, just before four in the afternoon, Franklin
Delano Roosevelt died in Warm Springs, Georgia. The news was broadcast
over the radio an hour later. One of the late President's favourite
songs, Home on the Range was played, over and over again.
He was, beyond question, the greatest American President since
Lincoln. Those two alone faced and surmounted crises that nearly
destroyed the country. They both died suddenly, in the last days of wars
in which they had led the forces of democracy and freedom to victory. In
both cases, as the funeral trains carried the dead Presidents back to
their homes, thousands of their compatriots lined the tracks, weeping.
FDR was an aristocrat who espoused the cause of the poor and hopeless.
He made the Democratic Party the party of liberalism and state
intervention, and consigned the Republicans to represent the affluent
and successful. That division continues.
The week before he was inaugurated, in March 1933, the American
financial system finally collapsed, after three years of the Depression.
It was a catastrophe predicted by Marx and Lenin.
The same crisis had brought Hitler to power in Germany two months
earlier. In America, Roosevelt turned Communist predictions on their
heads. He proclaimed: ''We have nothing to fear but fear itself'', one
of the two phrases by which he will always be remembered, and set about
restoring the capitalist system by vigorously using the latent powers of
his office.
We have just watched Newt Gingrich attempt to emulate Roosevelt by
passing his Contract with America in the first 100 days of the new
Congress. He got his Bills through the House, no more: in Roosevelt's
first 100 days, President and Congress rushed through and put into
effect the basic legislation that saved the country.
The banks were reopened, the federal Government poured forth money to
revive the economy, and though it took another eight years and the
rearmament programme to bring complete recovery, FDR succeeded from the
day he took office in convincing the country that there would be no
final disaster; America would not go Communist or fascist.
There has been no comparable exercise in personal leadership in such a
short time in American history. Even Lincoln failed to avert the South's
secession, and it took him months to dominate Washington. The best
parallel, perhaps, is Churchill's seizure of the levers of power in
London in May 1940 and the use he made of them.
FDR was the least ideological of Presidents (the contrast with Newt
Gingrich and his friends is striking). He was ready to try anything. The
New Deal was a succession of experiments. He reinforced successful
programmes and abandoned those that failed.
Wall Street and big business hated him, but no other President has
better followed the basic business dictum to go with success and to face
mistakes, and correct them, immediately.
Lincoln had to surmount the one, overwhelming challenge to the
survival of the United States. He met it with skill, courage and iron
determination -- and with an eloquence no other President has matched.
Roosevelt was not a great orator. Instead, he talked to the people in
their homes, in a series of weekly ''fireside chats'', in which he
explained whatever Government problem was facing him at the time.
Everyone listened, and his voice became the most familiar in the
country.
The Depression was the great crisis of the times for the United
States. The Second World War was, of course, the defining event of the
mid-century for most of the world, but once the United States was forced
to enter it, victory was always certain -- provided the Americans
remained steadfast.
Roosevelt saved Britain, in her direst hour, by the Lend-Lease
agreement. In theory and in law, it was a trade of 50 destroyers for a
few bases in the West Indies; in practice, it provided everything. The
first cargos of munitions landed in Liverpool within 24 hours of the
Bill's signing: they had been loaded and sent to sea, quite illegally,
weeks earlier.
Roosevelt denounced the attack on Pearl Harbor as ''A day that will
live in infamy'' (his second most memorable phrase), and that
indignation carried the country through the war.
The day he died, as allied armies closed in on Berlin, he wrote: ''The
mere conquest of our enemies is not enough. We must go on to do all in
our power to conquer the doubts and the fears, the ignorance and the
greed, which made this horror possible.
''Today we are faced with the pre-eminent fact that, if civilisation
is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships --
the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work
together, in the same world, at peace.'' It is a good epitaph.

WHAT is it with guys and shopping? Stroll down any high street of a
Saturday and you will find it littered with men who, no matter their
age, look like they are on the verge of a toddler tandrum. They reckon
that if you help choose a girl's blouse then you are one.
In the modern lexicon, ''let's go shopping'' seems to register on the
male psyche with all the force and reverberations of a super-strength
satanic curse. They cower at its very mention, pathetically pleading
mercy and previous engagements, like a sudden urgent root-canal
treatment. ''Oh, you know, I'd love to come with you while you shop for
my mum and dad's silver wedding anniversary present, but I've just
remembered that I really have to go to have my mouth ripped to pieces.''
A broody glare and furrowed eyebrows comprise the classic visage of
Man at the Shops, a slight variation of Man on the Scaffold. They trail
after their woman with that hang-dog,
sick-to-the-backteeth-that-the-dentist-hasn't-got-his-hands-on look.
''Why are you doing this to me?'' reads their resentful glower. ''I
could have stayed at home watching Gazzetta Football Italia/reading
Dostoevsky/picking my nose instead.''
The stereotype is that women love to shop and men would rather be
anywhere else, and television advertisement plays up to the cliche, such
as the Scottish Beef advert which has a man stuck outside a woman's
changing room, callously ignoring his mutton-dressed-as-lamb girlfiend's
desperate entreaties as to how she looks, instead fantasising about a
wok full of beef and blackbean sauce. Worse, is that Skol lager advert
which reinforces men's deepest fears; if you loiter in the lingerie
department you will open yourself to ritual and abject humiliation.
This is such a pile of smelly steaming stuff. It's not all a case of
women shopping till their partners drop. The only man who staggers
around after his spouse, entombed under her various purchases, is the
chap in the Gambols cartoon. Men don't really go shopping with their
girlfriends/wives. They stand outside Marks and Spencer participating in
smoking competitions -- and that includes the non-smokers. They complain
loudly and incessantly that they have been standing around for hours
when in fact they have had to hang on for five minutes while you queue
to pay for something.
And they lie. Men aren't bored by shopping. They're scared of it.
Look, women hate shopping too -- who wants to trudge around busy, sweaty
malls wasting time which could be spent doing something more useful and
life-enhancing, like painting your toenails? But we know it is
essential. Shopping is essential to survival, it is essential to sustain
civilisation as we know it. As usual, women have come a cropper in the
ole hunting and gathering evolution cycle. We have fought/been forced to
hunt with the boys -- pin that salary down gals -- but we still have to
do all the gathering stuff too.
Men might deign to make trips to the computer and hi-fi and incredibly
expensive things store, or even to the video shop, or, at a push, and
when they're feeling particularly romantic/guilty/pissed, the local
take-away, but who do they think purchases the more mundane essentials
in life? The things which make life worth living, like egg cups, air
fresheners, and pillowcases? When they set up home they assume that
these things appear magically. I mean, most men wouldn't even know where
to go to buy a garlic crusher. They'd simply give up after flicking
through Yellow Pages under G for Garlic Crusher Emporium.
Look what happened to eighties man when he left mommy, kicked out his
girlfriend, and decided to pursue a decadent bachelor lifestyle. He
invented a noxious fashion, shoes with no socks -- oh, Charlie Nicholas
you had a lot of smelly feet to answer for -- and elevated
''minimalism'' to cool status which meant that when bottles needed
opening, packets needed cutting or garlic needed crushing they simply
did it with their teeth. Small wonder they needed all that root-canal
treatment.
And don't give me any of that ''but things are diffent now'' tosh. The
only reason the modern single man has a well-stocked flat is because all
his previous live-ins stocked it for him.
Like I said, men are scared of shopping because in the wise words of
those semiologists of yesteryear, Big Audio Dynamite, they would rather
''sail across the ocean than make a big decision''. Translate big
decision into a choice between the white Pierre Cardin shirt in Smith's
menswear and the patterned number in Ted Baker's and I think you might
see what I mean; most men would rather drink the bloody ocean.
All those couples you see down town looking like they're on the verge
of divorce aren't shopping for her. They're shopping for him. A
heterosexual man who ventures down to the shops on his own to purchase
his spring wardrobe will return with a Mars Bar and a new computer game.
He needs a woman to direct and motivate him in his task and, more
importantly, to shield him from the inveigling ministrations of male
shop assistants. He needs a woman to tell him what he looks good in and
to tell him what he wants.
And he will keep her down town all day doing so, without the slightest
whiff of guilt. And if, at the end of the day, she persuades him to hang
on while she snaps up a Wonderbra he will reinvent whole episodes as one
where he patiently and miserably hung about while she pondered forever.
And he will forget all about the two-and-a-half hours he spent in HMV,
obsessively searching for the Sunset label copy of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah
Band's A Doughtnut in Granny's Greenhouse.
Nope, he'll settle back into the cab on the way home, clutching all
his bags, and give a long-suffering sigh and say: ''Don't ever make me
go shopping with you again.''

MAY all the saints deliver us from Stewart Lamont's liberal compassion
(April 1). Indeed, the total sincerity with which he promotes ''family
planning and birth control'' is not in doubt. The man is all heart.
What is somewhat in dubiety remains the soundness of the intellectual
process and basic premises he uses to improve on John Paul's teaching as
pastor of Peter's erring flock.
Why should any Christian writer fear mere numbers of his fellow human
beings, and miscall them a ''biological time-bomb''? Perhaps because
these pullulating dark-skinned hordes threaten not ''world peace and
security'' but the hegemony of materialist capitalism?
If new life should always be controlled by ''social, economic, and
individual'' situations, how will any dynamic change ever occur? It is
noticeable that Stewart Lamont fears civil disobedience; yet how else is
the world to be turned upside down as I understand is his Master's
intention?
I well recall how many concerned Scots intellectuals took one look at
the slums of the sixties and concluded (arithmetically if inhumanly)
that less poor people would mean a little more for each. Stability and
control were their watchwords.
Thanks to the Abortion Act of 1967 and the missionary zeal of the
domiciliary birth controllers, the generation that could have demanded
redistribution of wealth and land reform did not materialise.
We still ensure the same skewed social order as Honduras where also
10% of the population control 90% of the nation's resources. Our poor
are not better off, just reduced in numbers.
The most efficient form of land use, in terms of crops per acre,
remains the family croft. Barren lands are created by financiers who can
buy up whole peninsulas or islands as a whim or an investment, or pick
up 20,000 acres, townships, tenants, and all, for #200,000, thanks to
being a boon companion of the proprietor.
In Knoydart, Eigg, North Morar the crofts are sheep-walks or deer
pastures, and the lads that should be working them are driven to despair
and early death by the iron grip of the secure state that holds them
fast in the deprivation belt of Glasgow's ghetto schemes.
Is there not clear print of the cloven hoof when Stewart Lamont
deplores ''political tension'' in Zionist Israel and deprecates the high
Palestinian birthright as a contributory cause? How else are they to
deliver their country from foreign domination? Palestinians have no
nuclear reactors.
How, save by the courage of child-bearing and child-rearing, are the
meek supposed to inherit the earth?

HOW predictably unfair was Stewart Lamont's oversimplification of
world problems addressed by the Pope in his latest encyclical,
Evangelium Vitae -- The Gospel of Life (April 1).
In the genre of ''I love you darling, but . . . '' he begins by
listing the Pope's many qualities, ''sincerity, consistency, and
strength of conviction'', qualities that, if in error, can only make
matters worse and were shared by Attila the Hun and Hitler.
But, as any regular reader of his column knows, when it comes to
matters Catholic Stewart Lamont has little allegiance to objectivity.
There seems to be something fundamentally flawed in a philosophy that
lays the entire blame of world overpopulation at the door of one old
celibate.
The majority of his own ignore this teaching. The Chinese, with their
teeming millions and policy of compulsory abortion of any second or
subsequent child, are hardly likely to kowtow to him. The Indian
sub-continent with its less than 1% Christian population and strong
tradition of the extended family is unlikely to listen. Likewise the
Japanese. Holland and Switzerland, no hotbeds of orthodox Catholicism,
have the highest ratio of people per square yard in the world.
But we are are asked to believe that if only the Pope would relent all
would somehow be well? Such blind faith in the power of the pontiff is
gratifying but could only be held by an outsider.
Lamont's latest attack fails to address the main issue raised -- the
totalitarian threat to human life posed by abortion and euthanasia.
Instead he suggests as the root cause the Pope's intransigent refusal to
accept artificial birth prevention, which has a knock-on effect in the
new killing fields, the unborn and the old.
How contraception will lessen euthanasia when it will surely have the
opposite effect by exacerbating the imbalance in society and thus
accelerating demands for redress remains unclear.
Then there is the claim that there is ''a need to limit and control
new life according to social ecological and individual situations''. No
mention is given as to who is to be given the power, or what sanctions
will be put in place, or who will implement them.
The concept of the state existing for man, not man for state, is
brushed aside in this headlong rush to judgment, much as a man might
tear down his house for stones to throw at an enemy.
But by far the most abject failure of one purporting to be a ''man of
the cloth'' is in Lamont not realising that had his own criteria for new
life, with his blatant option for the rich, been in place since the dawn
of history then the Christ whom he claims to serve would never have been
allowed to see the light of day.

IF there is an EEC quota for red herrings it was exceeded in one trawl
by Sarah Nelson's expedition into the deep water of the abortion debate
(April 8).
Only one question needs to be addressed initially: ''Is the foetus a
human being?'' If the answer is positive then that human being has the
same rights as any other and therefore the same right to life itself. If
it is not human it is merely a collection of cells and may be dealt with
as is most convenient to the potential mother. No wringing of hands is
required.
The raising of issues like rape, women's rights, women's health, or
damaged foetuses has been since 1967 a persistent tactic of the
pro-abortion lobby and for good reason. There would be little hope of
gaining the acquiescence of the public to the slaughter of children
unless that public was first of all diverted from the real issue.
The reality is that in the UK the overwhelming majority of abortions
are carried out for reasons of mere convenience or other similar reasons
which cannot begin to justify the taking of life.
Abortion to save the life of the mother, for example, accounts for
fewer than 100 abortions since 1967. One of our oldest maxims is that
''Hard cases make bad law''. The abortion law is the best possible
illustration of this.
As it happens, another serious flaw appears in the article. The
argument that high incidence of abortion calls for improved availability
of contraception simply ignores the facts. It is simply a fact of
history that the statistics from all over the world show that the more
readily available contraception becomes, the greater the demand for
abortion. I do not propose to explain this but merely point the fact
out.
The truth is not served well by concentration on the periphery of an
issue to the exclusion of the centre.

CONGRATULATIONS to Mr McKinney of the Scottish Decorators' Federation
for his persistent campaign relating to the problems sub-contractors
face through late payment or non-payment by main contractors in the
construction industry (April 7).
It was also of interest to note that following the Clydesdale Group
demise ordinary creditors are being offered 10p in the pound whereas all
four lending banks have had their debt paid in full. Where is the
justice?
Our company policy for over 30 years has been to turn down work from
main contractors because experience has taught us it is not worth the
hassle. The Herald's pages could easily be filled with problems
sub-contractors face just trying to get paid, and the sooner the
construction industry simplifies payment procedures to protect small
firms the better.
A recent report by the chairman of the British Airports Authority
indicated British construction costs were much higher than those in the
USA and Europe. Co-operation in finance rather than confrontation would
improve efficiency overnight.
A first-class sub-contractor our company uses faces bankruptcy because
a main contractor has failed to pay a large contract sum due to them.
This causes untold misery to the owners and employees through no fault
of theirs.
Surely a consultative body can address this very real problem which is
getting worse by the day in our industry and we can then all get back to
enjoying good business relationships.

YOUR article on the Regional Chemist and Public Analyst highlights
just how ill-thought-out are the proposals for the reorganisation of
local government in Scotland (April 1).
This department provides a very successful service so necessary to the
public, yet it does not command the publicity accorded to departments
such as education, social work and roads.
Like Trading Standards, the regional chemist department works in the
background, covering a wide area. This will make it very difficult for
the new authorities to provide a similar service.
It is obvious that those who thought out this reorganisation never
gave enough thought to these very essential services, and, as you so
rightly point out, because of the lack of public analysts the new
authorities may have to look elsewhere, ie England. The sufferer is the
public which will receive a much poorer service.
The loss of such a service and skills involved will be a tragedy along
the lines of Rolls Royce and others, and one wonders will MPs raise the
issue in Parliament.
If the services, the skills and the know-how are lost, we will be
totally dependent on private ventures which will hold the public to
ransom.

DAVID Belcher has given inaccurate information concerning Bob Dylan's
opening shows in Prague (March 27). He writes that Dylan was
''kung-fu'ing at the mikestand''.
I saw all three shows in Prague, the following three in Germany, and
the opening night in Holland. In Prague, although recovering from the
flu, Dylan was in excellent form. He did perform without his guitar, he
was very animated, and displayed his liking for bizarre dance steps but
I didn't see any movements which could be described as kung-fu'ing.
To see Dylan on stage attempting any form of kung-fu movements would
be both sad and embarrassing and would suggest an artist prepared to use
this gimmick to shock and thrill when everything else has failed. This
does not apply to Dylan.

WITH a recent survey indicating a 16% drop in giving to charities
since its inception, isn't this further evidence that the National
Lottery will progressively do far more harm than good?
This came in the same week as the Church of Scotland expressed concern
over future funding for ministers' stipends. It is a sad fact that of
those current subscribing to the lottery, many will squander far in
excess of the average #1 offering per churchgoer each Sunday.
I suspect the Church would be glad of a share of the pulling power and
attraction of the lottery as it strives for the much wider and worthier
cause that is salvation.
Indeed, I was surprised that there was no widespread condemnation of
Camelot's initial and ongoing advertising campaign where the seemingly
divine hand descends from the firmament accompanied by a celestial voice
proclaiming, ''It could be you!'' to the delight of the hapless punter.
I find the whole prospect increasingly distasteful but I have to hand
it to the Government. How else could it have squeezed another 12p in the
pound tax from us voluntarily?
The fervour generated by the possibility of instant wealth is
indicative of much that us wrong with our modern society. Naturally we
only hear of the winners, but how many thousands have spent a small
fortune in vain?

CONCERNING the fishing dispute between Canada and Spain, it is a basic
fact of life that one should always defend those who are trustworthy. So
which of our illustrious politicians is rushing to defend Canada against
the Spanish pirates?
Another basic fact of life is that anyone who does not defend those
who are worthy of trust must themselves be untrustworthy.
John Major has done something to defend Canada but he constantly
attacks the teaching profession and the NHS, which are both trustworthy
organisations. Tony Blair is doing something to defend the teachers and
the NHS but he says nothing about the fishing dispute.
The SNP believes in an independent Scotland inside Europe, so I expect
Alex Salmond will be rushing to defend the Spanish pirates, whether he
likes it or not.

HAVING read Ian Bell's article I was left bewildered at just how low
an opinion he has of Scotland and his fellow Scots (April 6).
To use a unique and highly prestigious project, which is capable of
restoring Scotland's fortunes as an international tourist destination,
as the butt of his humour was even more puzzling. Portraying Scotland as
a ''silly wee nation'' merely serves to perpetuate the self-deprecation
that stifles home grown initiative and entrepreneurial flair.
Before unleashing his outburst I would have been more impressed if Ian
Bell had taken the trouble to contact the company, to learn for himself
some of the detail which has emerged from two years of intensive market
research and development.
Had he done so he would have found that the idea of an all-day,
all-weather, fun outing at the Scottish Heritage Park already has the
overwhelming support of Scots.
May I correct one major factual error, namely, that the Millennium
Commission is ''being asked to pick up most of the tab''? In fact the
majority of the funding is being provided by the private sector and only
a relatively small proportion is being requested from the Millennium
Commission.
Given this project is capable of creating over 1100 jobs, it is widely
regarded as providing exceptionally good value for money and therefore
worthy of more serious comment.

ECONOMIC reports produced by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development are probably the most highly regarded sets
of data produced in the world. We live in an era of measuring things
and, like it or lump it, the statistics produced at the end of a process
begun by those who decide what we should ask Joe and Josephine Public
and culminating in the hands of number crunchers are gaining growing
credibility. The OECD made its name by focusing on economic matters. At
a time of greater public accountability it was inevitable that the
questionnaire and hi-tech equivalent of the abacus would zero in on
big-spending state functions such as education and health. What do they
tell us? Quite a lot, judging by the report on public expectations of,
and satisfaction with, education in 12 leading OECD countries. The
statistics are interesting enough in themselves, but take on an added
significance given the lead role the Scottish Office Education
Department had in their compilation. There is more than a dollop of
broth in this plate of alphabet soup. What can we see when we dip our
spoon into the mix? As users of education, or as taxpayers, we have a
right at least to stick our noses into the pot.
The OECD survey suggests that there is less concern about curriculum
issues than about the development of personal qualities. The public, it
seems, is most concerned about our schools instilling such qualities as
self-confidence and skills which will help young people secure
employment. So in our stirring about we should be looking for V for
vocation. How do we fare in Scotland? It appears that we have little
enough to worry about. Higher Still, the blueprint for secondary
education, will result in a unified system of curriculum and assessment
which will go a long way towards giving academic and vocational subjects
equal standing. It will also make the structure of upper secondary
schooling more easily understood by pupils, parents, and employers
alike. It will be the envy of many, including our English and Welsh
neighbours who are suffering about a confusion of awards and progression
routes. The report reminds us that that there are other concerns beyond
the curriculum. We have entered an era when, as Tony Blair recently
reminded us, people can no longer expect to spend their whole working
career in one job. This in turn means that, on entering employment, we
must possess qualities which enable us to be flexible and adaptable.
In some respects we are moving away from the primacy of curricular
subjects by promoting a system in which the ''core skills'' of literacy,
numeracy, information technology, and personal and interpersonal skills
will form the basis of educational provision, and will promote the
flexibility to enable individuals to move readily between jobs. The most
interesting aspect of the analysis is that the call for schools to
develop qualities such as self-confidence comes mainly from parents. The
conclusion must be that the question ''What makes a good school?'' will
no longer prompt an answer which is no longer predominantly related to
exam results. The day may be not far away when the much maligned 'league
tables' cease to be so avidly read.

SCROUNGERS keep out. The High Court's rulings in the three linked test
cases yesterday send a clear message to the so-called ''benefit
tourists'' -- the British state will not keep you come what may. Britain
is not a soft touch. The new rules to stop the practice known as
''benefit tourism'' -- an abuse by any name -- being challenged before
the court were introduced last year under the Income Related Benefits
Schemes (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No 3) Regulations by the Social
Services Secretary, Peter Lilley. The court decided that the rules were
valid in both European and domestic law after lawyers for the four
British residents involved -- a Pakistani with British nationality, an
Ethiopian naturalised as a French citizen, and two Germans -- had argued
that it was outside the Government's powers to introduce the concept of
habitual residence. People were eligible to claim benefits simply by
being ''a person in Great Britain'', they said. The lawyers for the
three EU citizens also claimed that the habitual residence test
established by the regulations amounted to unlawful discrimination
against European job seekers. Under European Community law every citizen
of the EU has the right to move and reside freely within the territory
of member states.
The new regulations require that people who come to live here in order
to be eligible for benefit assistance must be habitual residents, not
just ''persons in Great Britain''. It is that distinction the High Court
has supported. At first sight the decision seems fair. But, while
welcoming it, we should at least raise a caveat. The problem with any
test operated by bureaucrats arises when it is applied to specific
cases, not the general abuse it has been designed to eradicate. With the
best will in the world to the hard-pressed DSS civil servants who must
operate the benefits schemes, the habitual residence test will all too
often be operated by Jobsworths with neither the authority to apply it
with discretion, that is to say to take individual circumstances into
account and so make allowances, nor the capacity to do so if given such
scope. As a result, as critics of the scheme point out, the genuinely
deserving could be consigned to outer darkness, along with the
scroungers.
Parliament, after all, got it wrong over the Child Support Agency,
albeit with a lot of help from the agency itself, and Mr Lilley had to
make major reforms to a fatally flawed scheme. But it took a furious
public outcry to make him budge. Who is to say his department's
draftsmen, let alone Parliament, have not got it wrong again? Scrutiny
of such regulations by politicians tends to be perfunctory to say the
least. Applied rigidly, the habitual resident test could mean that
returning unemployed expatriates, British passport-holders and others,
including European Union nationals, entitled to live here would face
destitution because they would be deemed ineligible to receive benefit.
But the proof of any pudding is in the eating. Meantime Mr Lilley should
be given, as it were, the benefit of the doubt because there are no
grounds for the taxpayer supporting the benefit tourist. Over 1000 cases
are currently before social security benefits tribunals, and if the
decisions reveal that the habitual-resident test is working against the
needs of people entitled to receive benefit then clearly the regulations
must be amended -- and speedily.

''LABOUR leader achieves record high vote in the Scottish elections.''
These were the headlines from the 1980 district elections five months
before Jim Callaghan stepped down. With the addition of the word ''new''
(attached to both leader and Labour) they were running again last
Friday. The difference is that this time they are not true.
Four years after Jim Callaghan's last hurrah, Neil Kinnock did even
better in voting terms at the 1984 district poll. Yet the Labour
performance last week in Scotland was, we were reliably informed by the
Daily Record, its ''best for 40 years''. The Record clearly uses words
differently from the rest of us, as in reality the performance was less
in percentage terms than three separate local elections in the 1980s.
Although spin is now part of the art of politics, there is still a
need for the umpires to refrain from helping the bowlers. It was the
self-appointed umpire-in-chief -- the BBC -- which first set this
particular ball rolling by getting the election statistics wrong. A
great way to end a great week for the once great corporation!
One of the curses of being an economist is a fixation with figures.
Throughout the BBC's results programme last Thursday, my guts were
telling me that the BBC figure for labour could not be true, but in the
absence of any alternative statistics my head was telling me they had to
be correct in putting Labour at a record high of 47%. The BBC analysis
was even confirmed for me in writing by a member of the production team
at the end of the programme.
In fact, the real Labour figure was more than three points less than
the BBC version, and almost 10 points down on its most recent System
Three opinion poll rating. This is, of course, 5% up on its General
Election result -- but then so is the SNP's vote!
Lest this be diagnosed as a bout of Post-Election Tension, I should
make it clear that it was the Liberals rather than the SNP who were the
main casualties of the BBC gaffe. The BBC in Scotland was acting as a
guinea pig for a new computer analysis which was intended to be used in
the English local elections. By Friday the system was smouldering in a
corner, unable to produce any figures. Bring back the swingometer -- at
least you can correct it with a flick of the wrist!
By the time the SNP had checked and re-checked our own figures, the
media bird had flown, and even on Saturday all of the papers which had
not worked out their own calculations were citing the erroneous result
originally sourced in the wrong-programmed BBC computer. Of course,
anybody can make a mistake. What makes the BBC's so infuriating is an
almost manic inability to recognise, admit, and correct its errors.
These reflections on statistics are more than arid political
introspection. There is an important and illuminating comparison to be
made between the results in 1995 and the results in 1994 -- a comparison
that throws up the real changes in Scottish politics over the past
decade.
Compared with Kinnock's best day, Blair's Labour are two points lower,
the Tories 10 points down, the Liberals three points down, and the SNP
almost 15 percentage points to the good. That does indicate a
fundamental rearrangement of the political furniture in Scotland, but
perhaps not quite in the way that most pundits believe.
Far from Labour ruling the roost unchallenged in central Scotland
while the SNP and the Liberals clean up the rural fringe, the truth is
almost the opposite. Labour now faces effective and strengthening
competition in central Scotland from the SNP while it, like the SNP and
the Liberals, has been successful in extending its influence in other
areas at the expense of the fleeing Tories.
Of course Labour, for the time being, remains dominant, but for every
three people who vote Labour at local level, nearly two now vote SNP. In
1984 the Labour vote was not far off four times that of the SNP. The
Liberals only cling on by ruthless targeting.
Yet there is no trick of targeting that can save a Tory councillor.
Judging by the results last Thursday, the only method of escaping the
electors' wrath was by distancing your campaign as far as possible from
that of the party. Thus, Tories in the North-east hid behind the
Independent label, only to have their gaffe blown by Michael Hirst
exposing them as true blue during a campaign visit.
In Edinburgh, Councillor Brian Meek stood as a ''Colinton
Conservative'' in a successful attempt to convince the electorate that
he was more Colinton than Conservative. No ''Boy stood on the burning
deck'' for our Brian. I suspect that as dawn broke over the leafy
Edinburgh suburb on Friday, some electors could actually hear the cock
crowing three times.
And while that was happening, Michael Hirst was feverishly talking
about a resurrection for the Tories in Scotland. I seem to recall that
for a long while after the resurrection, the few faithful followers were
still being thrown to the lions.
Which brings me to Perth and Kinross . . .

FIRST, an award for public spiritedness to the man from the audience
who held a microphone to Natalie MacMaster's fiddle when her pick-up
went dead, a job akin to following the ball at a tennis match. At least
she was sitting down at the time.
She doesn't do a lot of sitting down. Nor does she do much standing
still. MacMaster comes from Cape Breton, where Scottish music has been
preserved, it's been said -- and there seems little argument -- in the
spirit of old, pre-gentrification, before it was White Heather Clubbed
into politeness.
Over there, they play music not for meekly tapping your feet to, but
for getting up and having a real old leap around. Mostly, MacMaster gets
so involved with playing for the leaping around that she leaps around,
too. Well, not quite leaps around. This is serious step dancing.
Intricate. Athletic.
And all the time she'll be playing fiddle with that irresistible blend
of enthusiasm and virtuosity. Percussive slurs, superfast arpeggios, and
hard-edged, damn near heavy- metal attack are her stock in trade.
Some tunes are marches learned from MacMaster's Uncle Buddy, one of
the great Cape Breton fiddlers. Others are slow airs played with a
vibrato as wide as the Clyde and a passion as intense as a blues guitar
solo or a jazz saxophone ballad.
Over at the piano, Tracey Dares sits puffing a breeze into her fringe,
pumping out accompaniments that are one part Jim MacLeod to nine parts
Jerry Lee Lewis. Bass players beware: with her busy, roving, and
mischievous left-hand parts, she'll put you out of business.

Scottish composer James McMillan's Seven Last Words from the Cross is
now on record. Michael Tumelty hears again a choral masterpiece
THIS week, the new recording of James MacMillan's most extra-ordinary
composition, Seven Last Words from the Cross, is released. In many of
MacMillan's works -- some of them not yet on record -- there are moments
when the composer takes the breath away, through inspired harnessing of
musical, dramatic and emotional resources, but he has written nothing
else like this.
A year ago, I left the world premiere performance of the Seven Last
Words in St Aloysius' Church and wrote that it might be a masterpiece.
After the second performance, a stunningly-atmospheric one in the
Tramway, I was convinced.
Having spent the last week listening to an advance copy of the CD, all
I can do is urge music lovers and anyone with the slightest religious
aspiration to listen to this work, a powerful and moving musical
testament that will transcend any commercial and artistic success
Scotland's most gifted composer has experienced.
Well, not quite all I can do. Several of the critical brethren (and
some members of the public), who heard the Seven Last Words only in its
piecemeal, televised version over the seven nights of Holy Week last
year, formed a fairly negative opinion that couldn't take account of the
integrity, flow, and cumulative effect of the piece, all of which were
imperceptible over seven chunks on seven nights. Go and hear the
complete work, I would urge.
And one other piece of urging, this time to the original performers of
the work, Cappella Nova and the BT Scottish Ensemble. Neither of these
groups, who featured in the televised version and both Scottish
performances to date, was chosen by BMG Classics, MacMillan's record
company, to make the recording. That job went to two London ensembles,
the choral group, Polyphony, and the London Chamber Orchestra.
To say that the Scottish groups were upset and insulted would be
putting it mildly. MacMillan himself, who conducts the performance on
the new CD, was deeply embarrassed by the affair. One can only hope that
it doesn't put Cappella Nova and the BT Scottish Ensemble off any
opportunity to reunite and perform it again, live in Scotland.
All that said, this is a magnificent performance and recording. If it
never quite matches up, spiritually and emotionally, to the impact of a
live performance, then that is no comment either on the music or the
performers. The best music -- and this is MacMillan's best -- will
always have that extra edge in a live performance.
From the moment it begins, with the strings intoning softly the
amen-like cadence picked up from the end of Tuireadh, MacMillan's elegy
to the victims of the Piper Alpha disaster, the Seven Last Words
commands silent attention.
The sonority of the second movement, which flows directly from the
great tradition of Bach and beyond, is staggering: a great edifice of
choral sound, punctuated by vast silences, and reiterated with a
confidence that is symptomatic of unshakeable faith.
The third movement contains MacMillan's purest melodic inspiration: a
gorgeous refrain with a solo violin (Christopher Warren-Green) soaring
high above the choir. (The violin solo is placed a wee bit forward in
the recording.) The fifth, featuring Christ's words, ''I thirst'' --
whispered, anguished, heartbroken -- is set in a landscape of string
sound that is static, heat-drenched, arid and stifling; an astonishing
piece of writing.
The violence of the strings in the sixth is offset by the implacable
calm of the choir: ''Is there any sorrow like my sorrow?''. The final
movement, introduced by a devastating choral setting of the words
''Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit'', contains the final
masterstroke, where MacMillan, in a long postlude for strings alone,
lets himself into the piece, shifting the idiom to his familiar Scottish
tongue as the music moves heart-stoppingly towards silence.
It's his greatest work, simple as that; a work of immense spiritual
and musical profundity, touched with genius, and a composition that will
take a place alongside the truly great, sacred choral classics. Mark my
words.

LYNNE WALKER reports from the Lucerne Music Festival where former
Royal SNO conductors are leading a baton charge
LUCERNE must be one of the most alluring festival cities in the world.
Its International Summer Music Festival was established in 1938 (beating
Edinburgh by some eight years), presenting high-quality performances and
world-class artists. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, Lucerne made
itself a present of a second festival, to take place at Easter, both
coming under the directorship of the Swiss conductor Matthias Bamert in
1992.
Though Bamert was a thoughtful contributor to programmes when
principal guest conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra, and a
vital spark in the RSNO's much-missed Musica Nova festivals, it was a
surprisingly daring invitation for the festival board. Given his lack of
previous experience in wooing sponsors, massaging egos, political
jiggery-pokery and all the other baggage that encumbers an artistic
director, he has been remarkably successful.
This year, the Easter festival's move forward by one week (away from
Holy Week and holidays) has been awarded by a 10% increase in ticket
sales. The sun beamed across the lake, Lucerne decked itself out in
yellow ribbons in preparation for Easter, and nearly full houses were
treated to some first-rate concerts.
Bamert has developed a successful double-pronged Easter formula
involving two concerts of sacred music in the beautiful Jesuit church
close by the newly-restored medieval Chapel Bridge, and three symphonic
concerts by An American orchestra in the Concert Hall.
Opening the festival, Philippe Herrewegh brought his Baroque expertise
to music by Bach, drawing radiant singing from his Collegium Vocale,
Ghent, in two cantatas, and a stylishly authentic accompaniment from his
Orchestre de La Chapelle Royale. More spiritual aspiration followed the
next evening with the Catalan, Jordi Savall, directing from the viola da
gamba. The rich vocal timbres and period instrument sounds of La Capella
Reial de Catalonia and Hesperion XX, gave added emphasis to the swelling
chords and hushed intensity of Victoria, and to Monteverdi's
extraordinarily theatrical approach to church music.
But the real festival buzz became evident at the first of the three
orchestral concerts, all given this year by the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra. Apparently the most listened-to orchestra on radio in
America, it has been enjoying one of its most successful periods since
Neeme Jarvi became music director in 1990. On the evidence of these
three concerts he has developed the same electric rapport with the
players that he enjoyed during his years as musical director and
principal conductor of the SNO.
The works with soloists were the least successful of the three
evenings -- probably because Jarvi, recovering from a bad bout of flu,
was too incapacitated to rehearse with them. That may account for the
aggressive approach Jard Van Nes took to love and life, loneliness and
death in Mahler's Ruckert-Leider. Of the two piano soloists, Bruno
Leonardo Gelber demonstrated his affinity with Beethoven's music in the
Piano Concerto No 5, while Michel Dalberto gave an over-dramatised
account of Grieg's Piano Concerto.
But in the Fifth Symphonies by both Shostakovich and Prokofiev, we
heard Jarvi at his most thrilling and uninhibited best. His recordings
of Prokofiev's symphonies with the RSNO are still numbered amongst the
top, and his athletic conducting and tight rhythmic control worked the
same magic with the Detroit players.
In many respects this orchestra sounded rather like the RSNO, not
least in its characterful rather than polished performances, and in its
sensitivity to light and shade. The encores were, as always with Jarvi,
real show-stoppers -- a movement from Shostakovich's Gadfly suite, a
dance by Nielsen and some breathtakingly colourful orchestral solos in a
piece by Rimsky-Korsakov. The dark-suited, silk-dressed, moneyed Lucerne
audience went wild!
What the Easter festival lacks in innovative programming (and Bamert
doesn't pretend anything other) is more than compensated for by the
summer festival. Luciano Berio is the featured composer-in-residence
this year, and he has chosen the music for three Musica Nova concerts.
Claudio Abbado conducts the Berlin Philharmonic, Riccardo Chailly
appears with the Royal Concertgebouw, the Vienna Philharmonic rubs
shoulders with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Sawallisch, and a host
of starry conductors and soloists are booked for Lucerne '95. Bamert's
budget is the biggest ever -- eight and a half million Swiss francs --
so it is just as well he has built up sponsorship from practically
nothing.
On the less serious side (a dimension that the sober Bamert tends to
keep to himself), gypsy musicians from as far away as India and
Andalusia will be performing in a week-long ''Gypsy-fest'' within the
festival, opening with a rumba and flamenco evening and ending with an
extravaganza in the vast concourse of Lucerne's railway station.
In 1998 Switzerland's new concert hall will be opened -- perched on
the shores of Lake Lucerne -- with an adjoining convention centre and
art gallery. Seating just 1800 the hall's acoustics are in the hands of
Russell Johnson, who was also responsible for Birmingham's acclaimed
Symphony Hall.
The budget for the new complex is 194 million Swiss francs, leaving
little doubt that not only is this a country with a lot of money, but
such is its confidence in the benefit of the arts that it will provide
whatever funds are necessary to make them the very best.

BEVERLY is the hostess from hell who furnishes her Hades with lava
lamps and beer-barrel bars. Grant Smeaton is the demon in drag, and
neighbours Sue, Angela, Tony, and Bev's husband Laurence are truly poor
tortured souls. At Bev's get-together it's all barbed-wire sympathy and
cut-throat questions mixed with olives and ''little cheesy pineapples''.
Mike Leigh's classic comedy has been lifted down from the shelf marked:
The Seventies Do Not Touch! And Tangerine, the new theatre company,
should be laughing, cause we all did.
Abigail's Party isn't in Beverly's living room, it's next door; but
her mum Susan has popped round to escape and welcome new neighbours Tony
and Angela to the area, allowing Beverly to play host to her guest's
hostages. Grant Smeaton literally wraps them up in uncomfortable coils
with questions like: ''Is he very violent?'', ''Did you vomit again?'',
and ''Did you have a lot of rows with your husband?'' On paper it's a
smirk, on stage it's a scream.
Leigh's wit bites beyond nostalgia. Though it can be enjoyed as a
product of its time now passed, the social contortions of entertaining,
one-upmanship and snobbery still blossom on the floral print sofas of a
million suburban sitting rooms.
Smeaton's Beverly, a true mistress of subtle sleaze and tack, is your
worst next-door neighbour. Ross Stenhouse's Laurence is the sad man in
the back of your office. While Marc de Launay and Morag Stark as Tony
and Sue -- both ''great'' as Bev would say -- remind us that social
intercourse in the nineties is no less complicated, you just can't use a
condom for protection.
Abigail's party, forget the tickets, just gate-crash.

GLASWEGIAN singer Terry Neason obviously subscribes to the ''variety
is the spice of life'' theory. Her latest show, Wild 'n' Wet Ones -- an
eclectic song collection which spans Edith Piaf to Tom Robinson via Tom
Lehrer and Stephen Sondheim -- is really a kind of cabaret: the musical
numbers flow out of and into the poems and jokes which Neason recites
from her Mastermind-type chair. These links highlight the recurring
themes: love, war, and Piaf.
What should have been the common denominator last night, of course,
was the Neason voice. Essentially deep, earthy, and extremely powerful,
it was used in so many different ways, and appeared in so many different
guises, that it would be difficult to recognise it again. The accent,
too, seemed to fluctuate according to the song. She started the night
with a gorgeous Celtic lilt on the folky Old Fashioned Love Song and
ended it by singing some of Piaf's greatest hits in English but with a
French accent which verged on the pastiche.
'Allo 'Allo impersonations apart, the Piaf selection (especially an
all-French rendering of Mon Dieu) was effective and allowed Neason to
develop the torch-singer style that had only been hinted at earlier in
the evening.
Throughout the show the balance was just right and the mood was not
allowed to become too serious. The emotive angst of Never Be the Sun was
quickly forgotten with the launching of Neason into Morticia mode as she
danced Lehrer's Masochism Tango. The real ear-opener, in terms of this
singer's talent, was a stunning Send In the Clowns -- more of a Send Out
for Kleenex.

It may be that anyone in Scotland who has been strapped for cash might
feel sympathy for the Conservative Party with its #17m overdraft. Or
perhaps not? George Hume discusses a fraught topic.
THE Dunkirk spirit -- stoicism in the face of adversity -- is alive
and well and to be found at the headquarters of the Scottish
Conservative and Unionist Party in Leith. Notwithstanding last week's
thrashing at the polls, The Bunker Mentality, by order of the day, is
not on display. Not publicly, at any rate.
The offices which run the Tories' machine in Scotland were recently
moved closer to the docks from Edinburgh's New Town, in order, say
cynics, to take advantage of proximity to the new Scottish Office, a
faceless, concrete blockhouse which the Scottish Tories like to think of
as theirs in perpetuity, however hard it has proved in recent times to
find MPs sufficient to man the ministerial posts.
But following last week's humiliation at the hands of the electorate
-- with General Election extinction north of the border, on the face of
it, a near racing certainty -- the flit now seems precipitate. The cash
could have been used for more pressing needs.
The first of these would have to be the reduction of the national
party's #17m overdraft with the Royal Bank of Scotland. Rival political
parties would give their eye-teeth to know the conditions of that
unsecured loan. Some note, purely in passing, that Tory grandee Lord
Younger of Prestwick is chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
According to the grimly-determined, up-beat message coming from Links
Place in Leith, membership of the party in Scotland stands somewhere
between 35,000 and 40,000 -- many of whom would appear to have been
elsewhere last Thursday when the polls were open.
On the fraught topic of money -- a #17m overdraft may have
concentrated the mind -- the books at Leith are said to be ''balanced'',
fund-raising is alleged to be ''on-going'', the Party's 10 MPs, it is
claimed, are ''in good heart'', and its 82 councillors simply straining
at the leash to get on with the job.
For those Scots supporters who have tossed in their bawbee, and are
concerned about the overdraft reminders that drop through the party's
Smith Square letterbox, the word from Links Place is that ''money raised
here is spent here''.
A cracking Tory candidate -- the source of supply has not so far been
revealed -- will be put up to contest every seat at the General
Election, for which a war chest, it is said, will be made ready.
However, no set membership fee is levied, and big business,
traditional supporter of the Tory Party, has in recent years proved
reluctant to chip in with the enthusiasm that once typified conglomerate
backing for true blue rule and a maniacal Lady Bountiful.
Notwithstanding their recent electoral set-backs in Scotland, only 10
MPs in Parliament, and with a by-election in a marginal seat pending --
to say nothing of that national overdraft giving one bank chairman
sleepless nights -- the message for public consumption being put out at
Links Place is that all will be right on the night. Party workers, may
want to believe it.
In Glasgow, where Scottish Labour Party leaders and officials are
laying other plans for the future occupancy of the Scottish Office in
Leith's Docklands, the pressure is on to build up the 22,000-strong
membership and put together a fighting fund sufficient to allow the
party to contest every seat at the General Election without financial
stringency . . . money being sent south to the national party's General
Election fund from which the fight for Scottish seats will be funded.
Already, Labour holds 49 of these seats, has 614 councillors in place
to spread the word, and employs a no-nonsense, easily-understood tariff
for membership -- #15 a year for the ordinary supporter, #12 for trades
union members and a #5 special for the elderly. Two recent fund-raising
bashes in Glasgow each brought in #10,000.
Although based 50 miles farther away from the Scottish Office in Leith
than their Tory opponents, the Labour Party view is that, without doubt,
they will get there first on General Election night.
With but two years to go, at the very outside, to mass its battalions
for General Election success, the Scottish National Party -- three MPs
in place and 182 councillors elected last week -- is working hard at
recruiting and fund- raising, and playing its cards close to its chest.
The Party's chief executive, Mike Russell, asked about membership
figures, retorted: ''I'm not telling you that,'' and went on to explain
that any figure between 10,000 and 300,000 tended to be disbelieved by a
sceptical world on the grounds that it was either too small or too
large. ''It just becomes ridiculous,'' he says.
Likewise, when it comes to cash, reserves or debt, figures are not for
the public arena. But Mr Russell points out that when the party puts up
a candidate in every seat at the General Election, there will be
sufficient funds for the Scottish Nationalists, as a whole, ''to punch
their weight''.
Shaken by the fact that they were outfunded by a factor of 20 to one
by the Tories at the last General Election, the SNP are going flat out
to build a substantial war chest ... the wallets of ex-pats in America
and elsewhere a particular target.
In Edinburgh, the Scottish Liberal Democrats -- 6029 members on its
books and nine MPs in the House of Commons -- is well pleased with its
9.8% of the recent poll, which brought the party 123 seats in Scottish
local government, plus two more in the islands. The party, nationally,
also banks with the Royal Bank of Scotland. ''But,'' says the Scottish
Liberal Democrats' chief executive, Andy Myles, ''we are unable to
borrow like the Tories.''
As to the General Election: ''We have already started to build a war
chest at the federal level of the party, and elsewhere are drawing
together funds. Prudent financial management is our watchword and we
will be going in to the General Election, fighting every seat, with no
deficit and an adequate war chest.''
Will they be able, come the day, to say that at Links Place?

Iraq is an ethnic and cultural mosaic with enormous potential for
sectarian divisions.
Gareth Smyth considers the nation's future
FOUR years after the Gulf War, the spectre of Saddam Hussein continues
to flicker. In a report to be discussed today by the UN Security
Council, Rolf Ekeus, the head of the UN's arms inspectorate, says that
Iraq has failed to account for 17 tons of substance which could be used
to breed material for germ warfare.
So begins a frantic period of diplomacy. The Security Council will
decide next month whether to allow Iraq to resume oil exports. The ban
is directly linked to Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction
and is the most important of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq when
it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Ekeus says Iraq has complied with UN resolutions demanding the
scrapping of nuclear and chemical weapons, but the possibility of Saddam
Hussein developing biological weapons weakens the argument of the
Security Council members -- France, Russia, and China -- who want
sanctions lifted.
Ekeus's report strengthens the position of the United States and
Britain, who believe lifting sanctions would boost Saddam and imply his
acceptance into the international community.
The future of Iraq is crucial to the Middle East. This is not just
because Iraq has a tenth of the world's oil reserves (more than any
country other than Saudi Arabia).
The Gulf war gave Iraq a huge political importance in the Middle East,
which remains a battleground where anti-western ideologies are pitted
against western interests. Sanctions have weakened Saddam. He recently
reopened -- live on Iraqi television -- a Baghdad steel suspension
bridge, rebuilt after its destruction by allied bombing in the Gulf war.
But, more crucially, Iraq is earning only $800m annually from (covert)
oil exports, compared with $12 billion annually before the war.
It is difficult to assess Saddam's strength. Iraq is one of the
world's most repressive states. Reliable information from inside the
country is sparse.
The Ba'ath Party's al-Thawra newspaper has admitted that there was in
March an attempted coup led by former military intelligence head Wafeek
al-Samara'i. But Saddam Hussein's security apparatus makes organising a
coup very difficult. ''A few Army officers can do little alone, but if
they increase their numbers they will be discovered,'' said Hamid
Bayati, spokesman for SCIRI (the Supreme Council for the Islamic
Revolution in Iraq), the main Shia group confronting the Iraqi Army in
the south.
But if sanctions have weakened Saddam, they have not removed him from
power. And if Saddam stays, sanctions serve only to punish the Iraqi
people, argue the French and Russians. Thomas Ekfal, representative of
the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), has alleged that half a
million Iraqi children have died of malnutrition and disease since
sanctions were imposed.
The real chance for the west to remove Saddam was in 1991, but US and
British troops failed to support the uprising of the Iraqi people in the
aftermath of the war because their Governments feared that Iraq would
fragment if Saddam were overthrown.
Hence the irony of today. As Saddam presides over a blockaded Iraq,
there is a real possibility that the country will gradually
disintegrate, and so follow the bloody path of Lebanon in the 1980s.
In a sense Iraq is already divided into three: the Kurdish safe haven
in the north protected by allied air cover; the southern ''no-fly
zone''; and the central belt around Baghdad which is Saddam's real power
base.
Arguably, ''Lebanonisation'' has already begun in the 50,000 square
kilometres of northern Iraq held by Kurdish guerrillas since the Allies
established ''safe havens'' to protect the Kurds.
The Kurdish enclave -- for four years under a double embargo, from the
UN as part of Iraq and additionally from Baghdad -- has had no
opportunity to recover from being a battlefield in the 1980-88 Iran/Iraq
war. Around 4000 villages are still in ruins after their destruction by
Saddam.
Here Kurdish militias and two sets of foreign troops -- 30,000 Turkish
soldiers and an unknown number of Iranian revolutionary guards -- have
ill-defined, shifting spheres of control.
Guns shape the struggle for meagre resources. Western observers are
sceptical that a truce last weekend will end armed clashes between the
two major Kurdish factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
''Both the KDP and the PUK are pushed from below,'' said a US analyst
recently in northern Iraq. ''If the Kurdish leadership loses the
strategic picture, we can't plot western policy in terms of seeking
rational goals.'' But Kurd-on-Kurd violence, with its roots in tribal
rivalry, invokes the nightmare scenario that could enflame the whole of
Iraq.
Iraq is an ethnic and cultural mosaic. The potential for sectarian
divisions is enormous. Iraq has been brutalised by decades of war,
hardship, and government repression. Rivalries have been deliberately
fostered by Saddam's Ba'ath Party, whose power base lies with the Sunni
Arabs who make up only 20% of the population and who have traditionally
provided the country's elite.
The Sunni Arabs fear both the Kurds and the Shia Arabs. Both Sunni
Arabs and the Kurds fear that Iraq could become an Islamic Republic
allied with Iran -- a prospect which Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the
United States all view with terror. As 55% of Iraq's population are
Shias who share their religious traditions with Iran, ''Lebanonisation''
could produce a de facto Islamic Republic in a large part of Iraq.
A more pleasing possibility in western eyes is that Iraq has a
representative government with federal rights for the Kurds. But the US
and Britain have offered only limited support to the opposition Iraqi
National Congress (INC), which has established a base at Salahuddin
within the Kurdish enclave.
The INC is a coalition of opponents of Saddam Hussein, including the
Kurds, Arab nationalists including some ex-Ba'athists, liberal Shias,
and SCIRI.
It opposes the unconditional lifting of sanctions which would allow
Iraq to sell its oil on the world market. This would allow Saddam to
''rebuild his Army in ways worse than we can imagine,'' said senior
Kurdish spokesman Latif Rashid recently. The INC stresses that Saddam
has refused an invitation from the UN to sell oil for humanitarian
purposes. ''He is blackmailing the international community and holding
the Iraqi people to ransom,'' said Rashid.
The INC wants sanctions linked to human rights, and a strengthened
role for the UN within Iraq. It suggests sanctions should be eased for
the Kurdish enclave. All this would be unacceptable to Saddam.
If the west continues sanctions, argues the INC, it will need to take
a more active role in overthrowing Saddam and to increase assistance to
the opposition.
This is a high-risk strategy because there is no certain alternative
to Saddam. But allowing Saddam to stay in power -- as Iraq slips further
into instability and chaos -- may be more risky still.
FACTFILE
* Iraq has a population of around 18 million people. It has the
world's second largest oil reserves.
* Vast tracts of very fertile agricultural land are watered by the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
* The world's first civilisation was here, around 3000BC in
Mesopotamia (''the land between the rivers'').
* A quarter of Iraqis are Kurds, who are Sunnis but a distinct ethnic
group from the majority Arab population with their own language and
culture. There are around 4.5 million Kurds in Iraq (compared to 15
million in Turkey and seven million in Iran).
* Some 55% of Iraqis are Arab Shias, who share their religious
traditions with Iran.

The TUC rejects Government retirement plans. Roy Rogers reports
MILLIONS of Britons face the depressing prospect of having to wait
years in a ''twilight zone'' between retirement and receiving their
state pension.
This latest boost for the ''feel-bad factor'' comes from the TUC which
argues that Government plans to comply with European rulings on the
equalisation of pensions by harmonising upwards to the current 65-year
male threshold rather than downwards to the present 60-year women's
trigger are absurd.
Government arguments that Britain can only afford to equalise state
pensions at the higher age are challenged by an authoritative report
commissioned by the TUC which makes a strong case for pensions for all
at 60.
The TUC claims that the cost of levelling down would be nowhere near
as great as the #3.5billion the Goverment maintains and that to equalise
upwards would be to fly in the face of reality, for men and women are
retiring earlier.
Already a majority of men aged between 60 and 65 are no longer working
yet they still have to wait until they are 65 before they can get their
hands on their state retirement pensions.
The Pensions Bill currently before Parliament and due to receive its
second reading in the House of Commons after Easter will exacerbate that
problem by forcing millions of women to work an additional five years or
certainly wait an extra five years before receiving their pensions --
depriving each of them of #14,756 at today's rates.
Following a recent Income Data Services survey which found that two
out of three employees in major occupation pension schemes are taking
their pensions before they reach 60, and that 95% of them do so before
reaching the ''normal'' retirement age of 65, the TUC has used official
statistics to demonstrate how employees are opting for, or being forced,
into earlier and earlier retirement.
For Britain as a whole 55% of men currently retire between 60 and 65
and when that age range is extended to 55-year-olds as the retirement
level there are some 1.2 million men not working which represents an
astonishing 43% of the age group. Strathclyde is one of several regions
where the retirement levels are considerably higher than the average
(see table).
Women are also giving up work earlier with 46% of those aged between
55 and 60 no longer employed -- a situation which would appear to make
plans to raise their pension age to 65 even more ridiculous. Once again
the figure for Strathclyde is way above the average.
Raising the female pension age will replace direct sex discrimination
against men with indirect discrimination against women who already tend
to have far inferior pension arrangements.
Britain already pays its pensioners less than any other OECD country
and has one of the lowest support ratios in the developed world -- that
is we have fewer people of working age for every pensioner. But the TUC
argues that by the year 2040 only Ireland is expected to have a higher
support ratio as the situation in other countries worsens leaving
Britain as the second best placed country to pay decent retirement
pensions.
Studies commissioned by the Equal Opportunities Commission have
projected that the total rate of employers' and employees' National
Insurance contributions required to balance the NI Fund will fall by the
year 2021, increase until 2031 and thereafter fall sharply.
Mr Bryn Davies, an independent actuary commissioned by the TUC,
prepared alternative costings to the Government's #3.5billion estimate
of introducing pensions for all at 60 and concluded that the headline
cost would be #2.4billion, a figure which reduces to #700,000m once the
changes in tax revenues and public expenditure caused by having older
workers retired rather than younger people unemployed are taken into
account.
This would not be a massive burden on the public purse, especially as
the changes could be phased in and planned for.
As things stand women are being expected to bear the full cost of
equalising the state pension age even though they already get much the
worse deal from pensions.
TUC general secretary John Monks emphasises that the Pensions Bill
robs women, cheats men, and flies in the face of what is going on in the
world of work.
Men and women are retiring earlier -- some through choice but many
because it is almost impossible for older workers to find new jobs when
made redundant.
Accusing the Government of scaremongering over the cost of pensions in
the next century, Mr Monks declares it is only fair to equalise at 60,
bringing the retirement and pensions ages closer together and reducing
the ''twilight zone'' and boosting the elusive ''feel-good factor'' in
the process.

Less than 10% of British MPs are women, and all-party positive action
is required to redress the imbalance, according to Irene Oldfather
FOLLOWING the results of the local government elections in Scotland,
the issue of women's representation is back on the agenda. While women
make up 52% of the population, only 22% of councillors elected last week
were women.
Although there were improvements in the number of women elected in a
few areas of the country, notably south Ayrshire, overall Scotland and
the UK are a long way from ensuring that the number of women in politics
is even vaguely representative of the population as a whole.
A look at how we compare with our European partners must surely
justify the argument that 50% of candidates for a new Scottish assembly
should be women, and support the Labour Party's commitment to all-women
shortlists in winnable seats.
As the table shows, female representation in Britain remains lower
than in many other national legislatures in Europe. Less than 10% of
British MPs are women. This compares unfavourably with every country in
western Europe, except Belgium, Portugal, Greece, and France. The
chances of a woman being elected to Parliament are greater in socially
conservative Mediterranean countries like Italy and Spain, than in
Britain.
This contrasts strongly with the Scandinavian democracies, where
around 40% of the Swedish and Finnish representation in parliament is
female. A look at East European countries shows that although women's
representation is decreasing, it still remains higher in Hungary,
Bulgaria, Russia, and the Slovak Republic than in the UK. Seventy-seven
years after women obtained the vote and the first woman was elected to
Parliament, women's representation is appallingly low.
A number of reasons are put forward. These vary from the importance of
the ''merit'' system, which resulted in 163 women MPs between 1918 and
1992 compared with almost 4000 men, to the argument that women just
don't come forward. It is difficult to believe that there are so few
talented women and so many talented men; and in some cases women do come
forward but somehow fall through the net, while in other cases it is
evident that unlike our Scandinavian counterparts the structure of our
society and the working arrangements of our political institutions do
not lend themselves to supporting women in politics.
Problems such as working hours and child care remain unresolved. One
view put forward by woman activists is that women are too patient. After
77 years with such limited progress, there can surely be no doubt that a
cross-party programme of positive action is necessary to redress the
imbalance.
In France, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands quotas have been an
important part of party strategies to increase the political
representation of women. France, which has a worse record than the UK in
terms of women MPs, is an example of how things are changing, with the
issue of women's representation emerging in the present presidential
election campaign.
Prime Minister Balladur, a leading conservative candidate, has
proposed a constitutional amendment which would require that 30% of all
candidates on party lists for local and regional elections be women.
More recently he has promised that one-third of all Cabinet posts will
be filled by women.
Perhaps the UK could learn some lessons from Balladur. Women activists
in Britain would no doubt applaud the principle but wonder -- why only
30%? The socialist party too has a 30% quota on its parliamentary list
and also made a commitment to 50% women candidates in last year's
Euro-elections. France now has 30% female Euro-MPs compared with
Britain's 18%.
Scandinavia has a longer history of positive action: the Finnish
delegation to the European Parliament includes 62% women. Quotas have
long been a feature of the Norwegian Labour Party, the men in the party
recently demanded their own quota of 40% for both genders.
Without an all-party positive action programme in the UK, at the
current rate of change it would take about 200 years to achieve equal
representation for women in Parliament. If less than 10% of British MPs
were men would it take 200 years to redress the imbalance? Would the
''merit'' system still apply?

Ken Smith reports on a startling move by the STUC as it prepares for
reform at the heart of its own structures
THE male-dominated leaders of the trade union movement in Scotland are
making their greatest concession yet to the cause of fairer
representation for women.
From next year, there will be a women president of the Scottish TUC
every alternate year. In addition half of all the committees of the
STUC's general council -- the body that represents the trade union
movement between annual congresses -- will be chaired by women, and the
other half will have women vice-chairs.
The move is a startling one, given that the STUC has had only two
women presidents in the past 30 years or so. The general council has
decided, though, that if it is to be serious about making the trade
union movement more accessible to women then reform has to start at the
heart of its own structures.
As general council member Carmen McAteer of the white-collar union MSF
commented: ''I think one of the reasons why the movement finds it
difficult sometimes to recruit women part-time workers is that it can
come across as simply a row of men in grey suits.''
The recruitment of women into trade unions is becoming more important
simply from a numbers point of view. As employment in the traditional
male industries of steel-making, mining, and heavy engineering declines,
unions have to recruit elsewhere -- and that often means women workers.
Many, though, do not have a tradition of joining a union. A lot of
women have part-time jobs and do not see the relevance of a union. They
can often be in jobs where there is a high turnover such as the retail
sector, and so recruiting becomes a constant job for officials.
Over the years, speeches from the platform at the STUC's annual
congress -- this year's takes place in Perth later this month -- have
been more supportive of so-called women's issues such as better
childcare facilities. Women quite rightly argue that proper childcare
facilities is not just a women's issue.
However, there seemed to be little movement where the power lay. Union
bosses were still men. Then, five years ago, the STUC put aside 10 seats
on its general council for women.
There are now 11 women on the council out of 33. It means naturally
that women's influence has grown. For example the STUC has been one of
the major supporters of the campaign for half of the seats in a Scottish
parliament to be reserved for women.
Now comes the change within the general council itself, which is not
just about numbers. As Ms McAteer says: ''Obviously it will help change
the image of the movement if it is seen that there's a place for women
at the very top. But I think it will also offer a different perspective
on some of the economic issues.
''Women in key positions will be able constantly to remind the general
council where women are in the Scottish economy. I think it will focus
much more work on improving the pay of women; access to childcare
facilities; and access to training. Working women don't get access to
training as they are often not involved in traditional apprenticeships
or in the skilled jobs.''
There are other subtle changes. As far as possible future STUC
delegations, such as meeting Government Ministers, will have equal
numbers of men and women.
As Mary Harrison, a regional organiser with the general workers'
union, the GMB, and the person most likely to be the next woman
president, pointed out, the time that people are most likely to see
trade union leaders on television is after a high-powered meeting with
Government Ministers. If the delegation is all-men it just reinforces
the prejudice that men are in charge.
''I think if the trade union movement is serious about changing its
agenda and appealing to the hundreds of thousands of women out there who
are not yet in a union or feel they are in jobs which unions are not
interested in, then it is important to present an image where women are
leading trade unions and fighting to make sure that women's issues are
fundamental to the trade union movement and not just tagged on at the
end.''
The women may even put forward the shocking suggestion that it should
be more fun to be in a union. ''We need to stop this image that you have
to be a martyr to be involved in the trade union movement,'' added Mary.
Now that really would be a revolutionary change.

Anne Johnstone reports on a new initiative to counter drug abuse in
Scotland
BY THIS time next month Rusty says he'll be an ex-drug addict. He's
lucky not to be an ex-person. Now 35, Rusty, from Dundee, has been
involved with drugs for nine years, including a three-year prison
sentence for possession of drugs and intent to supply. By the time he
was sent to Peterhead he was on a methadone substitution programme.
In prison, unable to get any, he survived on ''whatever I could get
hold of''. On his release day, his social worker arranged a doctor's
appointment. Unaware that Rusty's tolerance had fallen, the GP supplied
the same prescription of methadone he had taken before he was sent down,
50ml a day. That night Rusty nearly died. He claims he knows 40 others
who have died under the same circumstances.
Drug users and others who know the drug scene well say this is typical
of the lack of co-ordination between different parts of a policy
designed to tackle the serious and escalating problem of drug misuse in
Scotland. Concern, particularly at the rapid rise in drug-related
deaths, galvanised the Scottish Office into action last year.
Under Minister of State, Lord Fraser of Carmylie a team of
heavyweights in the field were formed into the Drugs Task Force. Their
report Drugs in Scotland: Meeting the Challenge, not only painted a grim
picture of a society ravaged by drug abuse, but also revealed a patchy
partial response to the problem developed in an ad hoc manner, a
strategy as full of holes as an addict's arm.
For the past six years, liaison between different parts of the service
was the job of Drug Liaison Committees, one in each health board area.
DLCs have chalked up some significant successes. As yet unpublished
figures indicate that the number of injecting drug users in Glasgow,
estimated last year as 10,000, is beginning to fall. A survey by the
Possil Drug Project among its users showed that 58% had stopped
injecting over an 18-month period.
But many dismissed the committees as talking shops mostly concerned
with the provision of services to users and carers. The criminal justice
system and topics such as prevention, education and research were
considered only peripherally.
The Scottish Office report heralded a new, considerably more muscular
body to replace the Drug Liaison Committees. The 15 Drug Action Teams
take over this month. They have been given just six months to draw up a
coherent overall strategy for tackling the drugs problem in their area.
St Andrew's House, clearly keen to be seen to be grasping a nettle, has
been specific about these new bodies.
Membership is to consist of very senior officials. Greater Glasgow's
DAT, which met for the first time last week, includes director of public
health, Harry Burns, an assistant chief constable and an assistant chief
executive at Strathclyde. There have been firm indications that pilot
projects will receive priority funding. Education and prevention moves
to a central position. One of the main tasks is the development of
material about drug misuse for the under-10s -- after research showing
that children as young as five are aware of the issues.
Another priority is the development of community-based alternatives to
prison, partly out of a recognition that many are recruited into a drug
sub-culture while in prison.
Will Drug Action Teams work where Drug Liaison Committees have failed?
Much depends on the outcome of the present power struggles going on
within individual health boards and councils about the membership of the
teams, with liaison committee members struggling to retain their
influence.
There is also fear that the initiative could get lost in the midst of
local government reorganisation. And though the presence of senior
officials is useful for giving clout to the initiative and easing its
passage through the maze of different agencies involved, is there a
danger that such lofty individuals will fall into the trap of believing
they know the answers, without properly consulting users and providers
on the ground?
In theory this won't happen because backing up the new Drug Action
Teams will be Drugs Forums. These will be catch-all bodies including
those running drugs projects, drugs-users, their families and community
representatives, to act as their eyes and ears on the ground.
The success or failure of the new arrangements is likely to depend on
whether these groups, you could say those at the sharp end of the
problem, are genuinely consulted. In particular, there has been much
made of ''user involvement'' in recent years. However, users who have
tried to form groups and have their say claim they are usually rebuffed.
Jim Mackie, of the Self Help Users' Group in Ayrshire, says the group
disbanded because they received no support or encouragement from
''uneducated workers who think they have all the answers''. A group of
drug-users in the Leith area, who submitted a tender to operate a
drop-in centre, after the one they used was closed, also had their
effort rejected.
David Liddell, director of the Scottish Drugs Forum, says his
organisation is pressing for more genuine user involvement at all levels
but has had little success ''despite all the rhetoric''.
Yesterday, the Forum published a set of postcards, designed by
drug-users and ex-drug users in Glasgow, as part of an initiative to
encourage drug injectors to use drugs more safely. Featuring a character
called ''Spike'', they will be distributed to users of the city's
needle-exchange scheme and through community projects.
The text uses local terminology and slang expressions. It's an
initiative that involves a non-judgmental approach which many will find
unpalatable but Liddell says: ''There are no miracle solutions to the
problem. It is therefore important to work with those still injecting
and give them accurate information on the risks they are taking in order
to limit the harm they do to themselves.''

Hats off to style as Anne Simpson reflects on crowning glories which
add a dash of fun and colour to the Easter parade.
THERE are certain women whose faces are made for hats. Women whose
angular features take on a mysterious cast the minute they make contact
with a downward brim. Garbo was a milliner's dream. With her over-long
nose, pugnacious jaw and hint of squint -- all somehow combining to
create unfathomable beauty -- she could rise to the challenge of a man's
beaten-up trilby, turning it into something every other woman would
covet, and, on her, every man adore.
But rather like shoulder pads, hats make psychological demands. A
woman must be in good fettle to cope with a distinguished crown,
otherwise the whole slant of it is capable of oppression, reducing a
woman to a pinched and desolate appearance -- which is hardly the point
of a good hat. But there are hats which, from the first moment on,
acquire potency so powerful that when they crop up in a photograph album
some 20 years later, they evoke precisely the mood and location of the
past. Jackie Kennedy's pert little pillbox was one of these. For a few
years in the sixties it bobbed along on the radiant horizon of a White
House called Camelot, only to become with brutal suddenness the
blood-sprayed reminder of a President's murder in Dallas.
Thirty years ago, though, hats were towny and very obviously
well-made, for you can still see some of them today, surviving on
silvery heads in polite hotels, nodding in outraged gossip over tea and
profiteroles. In those days hats remained the badge of good breeding, a
sort of extension of school uniform implying attendance in all the right
places and the very best of class. Boaters carried Henley overtones.
Peony-ladened cartwheels suggested Ascot; a fine straw picture hat some
top-notch graduation, and that sculptured shell in silk trembling with
osprey feathers was definitely marked out as flirtatious. A silly
cocktail hat which adhered only to silly heads as feminism pulled on its
despatch rider's beret and advanced.
The social occasions of different generations may vary but for a woman
or a man the desires which beat beneath a treasured hat are the same in
any age. Today, and this week particularly, headgear arrives as a
topping out ceremony to be doffed in the direction of spring, and in
many ways it has scarcely changed since those old straw boaters were
tilted at a Renoir angle, and deep-crowned panamas looked like something
snatched from Lewis Carroll.
A Gainsborough plateau from the Hat Shop; an ivory topper from Marks
and Spencers or C &amp; A, customised with the wearer's own inventive hat
band. Or a funnel of straw from Frederick Fox, curling outwards and
upwards to heaven . . . such are just a few of the mad confections which
go on parade to lighten the heart and gladden the eye from Easter until
Michaelmas.
And as much as any headstrong designer, the actress Kristin Scott
Thomas is responsible for bringing millinery back as a showpiece. Her
wildly undulating brims in Four Weddings and a Funeral are like
magnificent pancakes in ochre and scarlet but they make no sense at all,
not even for the chauffeured classes. But then, when did logic ever
govern style?

Deedee Cuddihy visits an exhibition for dedicated followers of fashion
IT'S been claimed that the late Jackie Kennedy loved clothes so much
that even her second husband, Greek billionaire Aristotle Onassis,
quaked when the monthly shopping bills came in. And Princess Diana
reputedly spends #5000 a week on her wardrobe.
However, according to an exhibition which opened earlier this month at
the Scotland Street Museum of Education in Glasgow, such extravagance by
people in the public eye is nothing new.
In ancient Rome emperors massaged their egos by wearing togas trimmed
with a rare purple dye made from a snail-like creature found only in
certain parts of the Mediterranean.
Elizabeth Tudor was famous for her extensive and magnificent wardrobe
although Marie Antoinette -- who was alleged to have spent more than
#250,000 on clothes and accessories in one year -- was probably more
extravagant.
A History of Haute Couture charts the evolution of fashion over the
past 400 years using costumes from Strathlcyde education department's
own comprehensive collection of original and reproduction dress.
Scotland Street's costume technician Karen Ashfield, a graduate of the
Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels, not only researched and
mounted the show but also made three costumes which feature in it.
Her Elizabethan gown in rich satin brocade and dark green velvet
trimmed with gold and jewels, the Georgian day dress in linen and lace
(hand-embroidered by Ashfield) and the Jane Austen style frock with
removable sleeves are as authentic as reproduction costumes can be,
right down to the boned bodices, the back lacing and the hook and eye
fastenings.
''Ours is a 'handling' collection,'' Ashfield explains. ''So the
costumes we make have to be as accurate as possible in order that the
children who wear them get a real idea of just how heavy and
uncomfortable some clothes used to be. Gowns with trains, bustles or
hoop skirts required a special technique to allow the wearer to simply
walk or sit down.''
The rest of the pieces in the show -- apart from a parasol and a
clever pair of embroidered, hanging pockets (as worn in the eighteenth
century) both made by Ashfield -- are all authentic. A muslin, two-piece
crinoline dress with Ayrshire embroidery and pink velvet ribbons could
have come straight from the pages of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women.
The history of fashion continues from a gorgeous Art Nouveau style
Liberty evening coat in purple satin, richly embroidered with flowers
and lined in pink, through a Dior-inspired black velvet coat dress from
R W Forsyth's, to a sixties black Courtelle mini dress -- so short it
looks like the top half of a two-piece costume and a layered, pleated
outfit from Japanese designer Issey Miyake's 1995 collection.
Ashfield was stuck for an item from the all-important British designer
Mary Quant -- until she remembered the Mary Quant Daisy Doll she reckons
she had played with in the 1970s. It was recovered after an extensive
search of her parents' loft and the doll, plus a selection from Daisy's
wardrobe including black and white striped bell bottoms and platform
shoes, can be also be seen at Scotland Street.
During the course of her research for the show, Ashfield discovered
that the origins of haute couture can be traced back more than two
centuries to Rose Bertin, the French dressmaker who was called Marie
Antoinette's Minister of Fashion.
The Empress Josephine also had a favourite dressmaker whom Napoleon
referred to as ''my wife's rag merchant''. But it was British designer
Charles Worth, who after moving to Paris in the 1840s where he had his
salon lit and decorated to simulate the ballrooms where his gowns would
eventually be worn,  became known as ''the father of haute couture''.
* A History of Haute Couture continues at Scotland Street Museum of
Education until May 14: 10am-5pm, Monday to Saturday; 2pm-5pm on
Sundays.

Derek Bentley was hanged in 1953: Iris Bentley tells JULIA LANGDON of
her battle to clear her brother's name
THIS is the story of an extraordinary life, or of two lives, really.
It is without question a tragedy and yet there is something immensely
endearing and heartening about the indomitable courage it reveals. When
people write about the character of the British people, of that British
bulldog of legend, Iris Bentley is the sort of person they should have
in mind.
The archetype for the traditional image of the true Brit is usually
someone in a bowler hat, best portrayed by John Cleese. Iris Bentley is
not like that. She is a working class Londoner in her sixties, living on
an ordinary street with the traffic whizzing round the roundabout
outside the front, in ordinary circumstances and she should be
contemplating retirement and the ordinary things that women of her age
do after a lifetime's hard work.
Iris is not about to retire and although she has got the cancer back
again and is undergoing chemotherapy and she does get very tired, she is
not about to die either. Iris has one more battle to win in her lifelong
campaign and she has it within sight. Iris still has work to do and that
is why she has written this book and why we are talking in her living
room when she has had a very long day and would rather be getting on
with her tea.
You know Iris Bentley, of course, although probably not as well as all
the Home Secretaries with whom she has corresponded these last 42 years.
She is the sister of Derek Bentley, the 19-year-old lad hanged for
murder in 1953, allegedly having uttered the words since made famous by
a film about the case: ''Let him have it Chris.''
Christopher Craig was 16, too young to hang for the murder of a
policeman, and he did ten years. Bentley was an epileptic with a mental
age of 11, and on December 11, 1952, he was sentenced to death; and on
January 28, 1953, he was hanged in Wandsworth Prison.
The fact that two years ago he -- or, rather, Iris -- was granted a
pardon for his sentence of death, hasn't really made anything better. Of
course she was delighted to have made an advance, and an official
acknowledgement that her brother should not have died was very
important.
But Iris Bentley's campaign is to achieve a full pardon on the grounds
she has consistently put forward: that her simple-minded brother was
present and deserved a jail sentence, but that he was not armed, hurt
nobody, did not speak the famous sentence attributed to him and that the
police evidence at his trial was falsified.
But what was Derek's story has, in a curious way, become something
else: the story of a relentless pursuit of justice. The importance of
this story cannot eclipse the 19 years of Derek Bentley's short life --
or the years of the other victim of th at November night now so long
ago, Police Constable Sidney Miles.
Nothing weighs in any balance against human life, but Iris Bentley, by
the way she has conducted herself across these years, has told us
something else about the nature of the human condition.
You think, of Iris: What a waste for her, of her life; the subjugation
of everything she has done to the campaign, what she calls ''The Case''.
She laughs this off, though.
''Oh no! I enjoy myself. I go to discos and parties that the Labour
Party organises. I'm not a drinker but I enjoy things. I go out -- when
I'm well -- and I go shopping and do my own chores . . .''-- but you can
see that while, of course, she is telling the truth nevertheless
everything still takes second place to ''The Case''.
It is interesting to speculate how Iris might have lived her life if
she had not spent it fighting for her dead brother. The campaign has not
been her whole life, but it has changed what would otherwise have been
mundane circumstances into something quite other.
Or has it? It could be that Iris Bentley was always going to do
something interesting. She was actually nine years old when she first
started bothering Home Secretaries and wrote a letter of protest --
about? Well, about capital punishment as it happens. She asked her
father about it, he explained, she disapproved and the letter seeking
abolition was written and dispatched.
She explains: ''He said: 'The way you feel you'll probably do a lot
towards it', and I did, didn't I ? But I didn't know my brother had to
suffer for it.''
Her parents were Conservative voters -- until ''The Case'' -- and then
switched to Labour. From a brief, unsuccessful marriage, Iris has a
31-year-old daughter, Maria, who is now a Labour councillor in their
south London borough and who is clearly a powerful political activist.
She is currently cooking the tea and has a lovely face and laughing
eyes. When she goes out canvassing, says Iris, Maria tells people: ''You
know who my mother is, you know I'll be a fighter.''
This book has partly been written because Iris was upset about some of
the things that had been said about her brother and her family. There
was a suggestion that he was a ''petty thief'', which horrifies her.
Their family would never steal, they were brought up that if they
couldn't afford something, they couldn't have it. She wanted to show
what their life was like and tell what she now knew had happened.
The story is a moving account of any ''ordinary'', decent working
class family of the times, but with more than its fair share of tragedy.
There were eight children born and only two survived to adulthood,
unless Derek's 19 years count as ''adult''.
His mental ability was affected by a fall as a small child. ''He was
easily led even before he had the fits,'' says Iris. He was following
her, just under two years younger, everywhere. She didn't know he was
there, he fell off a lorry on to which they had both climbed and their
lives changed for ever. ''I have always blamed myself,'' she says.
And there perhaps do we have part of the reason for her unending
campaign? Is it guilt? Everyone has told her that she couldn't have done
anything and, over the years, she has learned to live with her own sense
of responsibility, but she still says: ''I should have looked.'' On the
day he was executed she promised to devote her own life to clearing his
name and she has fulfilled that undertaking.
''I think I'm living his life for him,'' she shakes her head for the
pity of it. She still looks out at the garden in the spring and thinks
of all the springs he has missed, all that has happened to her in the
interevening years. He would never have lived a normal life, she knows
that, she would always have had to look after him, care for him, ''but
I'd've loved that,'' she says. She has a sincerity and a considerable
dignity which is moving.
Now she clearly feels the end is in sight, her objective can be
achieved. When she secured the pardon for the life sentence two years
ago, she was elated but, at the same time, bitterly disappointed that it
was not complete. She has had great help, however, from a number of
journalists who have assisted her and so it proved on this occasion.
A call was placed by one broadcaster to the then Shadow Home Secretary
who was asked how a Labour Government would have dealt with the case.
''He said: ' We would have given him a full pardon','' says Iris.
''We've got him on tape.'' His name was Tony Blair.
If he makes it to No 10, the letter of congratulations from Iris
Bentley will be one of the first through the door and if he fulfils his
pledge then, at last, she will be able to get on with living the rest of
her life.

The electrocution of Nick Ingram has refocused argument on capital
punishment. Looking back at the last woman to be hanged in Britain,
Carole Morin asks what execution does to the executioner
ON EASTER Sunday 40 years ago, Ruth Ellis shot her boyfriend with a
glossy black Smith and Wesson .38. David Blakely died of shock and blood
loss outside a Hampstead pub. He had been avoiding Ruth all weekend and
the cad probably hadn't bought her a chocolate egg, either.
She couldn't have picked a better Sunday to murder her boyfriend.
Easter merges the pagan pleasure of eating eggs with the Christian
crucifixion; Ellis's execution made her a slut martyr for our times.
Death is always a good story. It's the one subject that interests
everybody. And this particular story has ingredients that make it
memorable -- her Harlow-blonde hair, racy lifestyle, amour fou. Standing
in the dock in her black, tailored suit with astrakhan trim, Ellis was
easily cast as a film noir heroine. She had stardom written all over her
pencilled eyebrows.
The crime passionel is the easiest murder to empathise with. It's
possible to imagine yourself killing for passion; which seems more
romantic than killing for profit. But there were other women hanged this
century for murdering their men rather than standing by them. Who
remembers Charlotte Bryant or Ethel Lille Major?
Ellis committed her murder in front of an audience. She was a
photogenic, floozy, goodtime tart without a (clean) heart, blondes-have-
more-sin, multi-abortion sort of girl who was ripe for post-war tabloid
fame.
She used not a kitchen knife or a rolling-pin, but a glamour-girl gun.
But the vital ingredient that ensures her brazenly insecure image will
stay emblazoned on the century is that Ruth Ellis was the last woman in
England to hang.
By dying for her immortal sin, this Easter martyr Christess became a
symbol for the barbarity of execution; a warning against resurrecting
it.
The indelible role of Slut Martyr ensures a continuing fascination
with her story. Her daughter, Georgie, has just added to the biographies
with a book of her own: Ruth Ellis, My Mother. She's been accused of
profiting from the sins of the mother -- and why not? She was three when
her mummy was hanged, and remembers little about the real Ruth other
than her perfume -- Miss Dior.
But the mythical Ruth is imprinted on Georgie's soul, as she is on
ours. The interesting thing about Ms Ellis's book is not her sixties'
modelling as one of the (George) Best Set, or her nineties' stint as a
fortysomething in a massage parlour; it's the parallels she struggles to
emphasise between her own life and her mother's -- as if they need
introduction or apology.
It wasn't just the genes that made Georgie Ellis her mother's
daughter. The ease with which Miranda Richardson was made-up to resemble
Ruth Ellis in Dance with a Stranger reveals Ellis as everywoman:
enigmatic and transparent; fragile and greedy; sinner and saint.
In her life of prostitution and Pernod, she made God bleed. In the
condemned cell she made it up to Him, raising her cleansed face for
communion -- not even a little touch of lipstick to graze the wafer.
This romantic, religious Ruth believed in a life for a life. She
couldn't wait to join Blakely -- whose violence had included kicking her
pregnant abdomen -- in Heaven.
Her courage and composure -- or delusion and sedation -- as she lived
in the condemned cell cracked only once when she cried to her mother:
''I don't want to die!''
Apart from this lapse, Ruth Ellis couldn't face the thought of 10
years in Holloway. She preferred to die young and peroxided and 7st 5;
rather than face future release as a hag of 38, with her dark roots
showing. Without her looks -- the only thing she had to sell -- she was
destined to a life without glamour.
After a brandy for breakfast, Ruth Ellis faced the noose, reluctantly
wearing the compulsory prison-issue canvas knickers. The hangman, Albert
Pierrepoint, had already sized her up through a peep-hole. He knew the
knot would fit her neck, and had practised on a sand-bag.
He was paid 15 guineas to place the white hood over her head and pull
the lever. The Manchester publican had dreamed of becoming a hangman
since he was a wee boy. His father had been in the executioning
business, and so had his uncle.
Awful Albert had broken 520 necks when he retired. ''I enjoyed every
bloody minute of it,'' he said. His work took him all over the world
''always staying in posh hotels''. Georgie Ellis says: ''He must have
been strange.''
Ruth Ellis's serenity, as the audience in the execution chamber
watched her being manacled to the gallows, could have come from shock or
from God. There is comfort in certainty.
Even the certainty of a death sentence must in some ways be a relief.
The prisoner in the condemned cell -- whether it's unphotogenic Nick
Ingram in Georgia, or the more evocative Miranda Richardson in Dance
with a Stranger -- knows exactly how death will strike. Most of us have
to guess.
Never knowing when it's going to happen means you have to worry about
it all the time; or refuse to think about it at all. Once a time and a
date and method have been set for your death, there's nothing left to
worry about. The details are organised by someone else. Death becomes
something that is done to you, rather than a thing hanging over you
that, at some point, has to be faced.
Nick Ingram's temporary reprieve last week, after being shaved for the
electric chair, removed this certainty and reintroduced painful hope.
Mary Sawyer, who had watched Ingram tie her husband to a tree and shoot
him dead, endured 12 years of uncertainty and loss and pain and rage and
despair. While Ingram lived on Death Row, she lived with her nightmare.
The pathetic-looking Ingram, with his mousy hair and floppy moustache,
didn't kill for passion -- but for nothing. He is unlikely to be
remembered and should have been almost impossible to empathise with, yet
his case aroused huge public sympathy in Britain.
A thousand faxes a day were sent to Georgia, pleading for clemency.
This outcry is odd from a country that only last October expressed in a
Mori poll an overwhelming majority to restore capital punishment.
Of course, a country whose women fancy Hugh Grant is already odd. And
being asked in a shopping centre or a station to give a Yes or a No to
the death penalty makes a black or white answer easy. It costs more to
keep a murderer in the Scrubs than it does to send a boy to Eton. In the
abstract, legalised execution sounds like an attractive punishment for
anonymous sinners.
The execution of a (half) British citizen abroad, however, presents
the opportunity for an international moral highbrow act. We don't do
that here anymore! (A majority of us wants it restored -- but we don't
do it at the moment!)
No matter how heinous Ingram's crime, the act of execution becomes
repugnant when associated with an individual -- rather than the
threatening faceless evil it's essential to quell while ticking the Mori
questionnaire outside Sainsbury's.
Being revolted by the details of Ingram's death is a gesture of
atonement for an unlikely future self who commits unlikely future sins.
Imagining how you would feel -- with your head shaved, waiting for an
eager Southern gentleman to fry you like a fly.
If Ruth Ellis had shot her boyfriend this Easter instead of that other
Easter in 1955, she would not have been hanged. Because we don't hang
people these days; and even if we decide to reintroduce capital
punishment, a defence of diminished responsibility is now permitted.
But what of all the responsible murderers. Is there a humane way to
execute them?
In Dr Harold Hillman's study on the ''Possible pain experienced during
execution by different methods'' (Perception, Vol 22, 1993),
electrocution and hanging both get three stars. Gassing, beheading,
stoning, and shooting are also painful.
Dr Hillman concluded that the lethal injection is less painful than
the other methods currently practised -- and using a needle eliminates
the excuse for the hangman's peep-hole.
Though a needle, given its medical function, becomes as sinister as
the gallows when used as an instrument of death. The Hillman study
states that, even with this option, ''the pain may be so severe the
person faints from it''; and ''if the prisoner's veins are difficult to
cannulate . . . the procedure may become very fraught''.
Would any of the 72% who said Yes to capital punishment in the recent
poll be prepared to stick the needle in the vein, drop the axe, cast the
last stone? At the repugnant core of capital punishment is that
essential relationship: between the condemned and his executioner.
Georgie Ellis can forgive the judge who sentenced her mother; but
loathes Albert Pierrepoint.
Unfortunately, there is bound to be another little boy out there who's
always wanted to be an executioner. Or a big nurse with a syringe whose
moral rectitude would force her to volunteer her services as a death
technician.
What's the going rate for an execution these days? Any advance on 15
guineas? If a posh hotel is no longer a sufficient incentive, how about
a ride on Concorde? Or just the opportunity to bask in immoral
superiority, to indulge in the feeling of squalid power murderers crave
-- but with justice cheering, and punishment not a mortal issue.
However much death costs, there's always someone eager to audition for
a part in it.

LIVES in Scotland will be put at risk unless the fire service receives
more resources in the form of cash, training, manpower, and equipment,
its union warned yesterday.
Mr Ken Cameron, FBU general secretary, said people living in rural
areas were most vulnerable.
''Training and equipment in remote country areas are virtually
non-existent or very primitive. There are also more fires per million of
the population north of the Border, and a higher percentage of those
involved become fatalities,'' he said.
There is to be a campaign to persuade the public to send postcards to
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, demanding action on the crisis.
A recent report stated that there were 70% more fires in Scotland per
million population than in England and Wales.
The report identified the very young and the elderly as the likeliest
victims, especially at the weekend, in winter, and in the early hours of
the morning. A slower introduction of smoke alarms than elsewhere in the
UK was a significant additional factor.
Smoking materials were the biggest single killer, directly
attributable for 44% of fatalities. Faulty or badly-used electrical
appliances caused 25% of deaths, and chip-pan fires 6%.

ABSENCE because of staff sickness is costing the 370 direct service
organisations run by Scottish councils #30m a year, a study by the
Accounts Commission has found.
In some DSOs, sickness absence adds 10% to labour costs and the bill
is rising because employers now have to meet the full cost of statutory
sick pay. Also, since 1992, there is provision within manual employees'
pay and conditions for payment of average bonus for sickness absence.
''Such bonus payments increase absence costs by at least one-third and
this added cost presents DSOs with significant commercial
difficulties,'' says the report.
The direct service organisations employ more than 60,000 full-time and
part-time employees who do work with an annual value of more than #1000m
-- mostly on the maintenance of council buildings, grounds and roads,
and on refuse collection and street cleaning.
The commission recommends a 4% target for sickness absence, equivalent
to 10 days off a year, and urges that all unauthorised absence be
eliminated.
A reduction from the current public and private-sector average absence
rate for manual staff of 5.2% to 4% would save Scottish DSOs more than
#6m a year.
A ''firm but fair'' approach should be adopted by managers -- fair
when dealing with genuine cases of sickness, firm in being prepared to
take disciplinary action in cases of unauthorised absence, it says.
Formal absence policies and notification procedures also need to be
established and communicated to workers.
Local government reorganisation, the commission believes, provides an
important opportunity for the new single-tier councils to improve the
management of DSOs which are not running efficiently.
It stresses that, by operating properly-managed performance incentive
pay schemes linked to the financial performance of the business and
managing sickness absence effectively, DSOs can significantly improve
their performance.
Effective management of the labour force is critical. It must be
flexible to respond to changes, employees must be suitably motivated and
given the committed support of management.
''Our study provides best-practice guidance to DSO managers,'' Mr Bob
Black, controller of audit, said yesterday.
''But the message will also be of value to those councillors and
senior managers who will have the task of determining the culture,
structure, and management processes of the new unitary councils.
Well-managed DSOs can provide more for the money.''
One of the early priorities for the new single-tier councils is to
decide what is to happen to the DSOs, which have been run at a regional
level. One possibility is co-operation by neighbouring councils to
maintain a region-wide organisation.

Easter.
She spent the day with the 1st Battalion, The Princess of Wales's
Royal Regiment inside their Lisanelly Barracks base at Omagh, County
Tyrone, where five-year-old Rachel Downer (above) presented her with a
bouquet.
The Army said the visit was private and the Princess did not venture
out to meet the public, despite the fact she has become an extremely
popular figure there during eight previous visits.
She spent four hours meeting officers, soldiers, and families of the
regiment, of which she is colonel-in-chief.
She flew into RAF Aldergrove during the morning on an aircraft of the
Queen's Flight to be met by Army GOC Lieutenant General Sir Roger
Wheeler; Northern Ireland Minister Malcolm Moss; and senior RUC and RAF
officers.
Then she travelled by Wessex helicopter to Omagh for a briefing on the
changed face of soldiering since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires. Later,
she met the soldiers and their families for an informal chat, before
returning to London.

<HEADLINE>Irish Government to release seven more IRA prisoners</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978927850</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Irish Government yesterday authorised the release of seven IRA
prisoners in a continuing response to the Northern Ireland peace
process.
The men being set free in the latest Dublin gesture were all due to
leave prison under normal circumstances between May and December next
year.
The move, announced after a meeting of the Irish Cabinet, is certain
to put further pressure on the British Government for more flexibility
in the light of the current maintenance of peace in Northern Ireland.
It brings to 21 the number of IRA prisoners granted early release
since the IRA and Loyalist paramilitary groups announced their ceasefire
last summer.
Nine left jail before Christmas when the incoming Dublin government of
Prime Minister John Bruton reactivated a release plan drawn up by
previous premier Albert Reynolds.
The initial releases were delayed because of the involvement of a
senior IRA figure in a fatal shooting during a post office raid in Newry
last November.
After lengthy consideration, Justice Minister Nora Owen directed that
the releases should go ahead.
Another five IRA personnel were released in January.
As in the previous cases, the latest seven to be released will be
freed on condition that they keep the peace and be of good behaviour --
and do nothing to cause distress to anyone affected by the offences for
which they were originally jailed.
The Irish Government action was taken under the terms of its
anti-terrorist Offences Against the State Act.
Around 30 prisoners classified as having past or present IRA links
will still be in southern Irish jails when the present releases are
completed.
Sinn Fein last night welcomed the Dublin government move to free seven
more jailed IRA personnel and called on Britain to ''act quickly'' on
the prisoners issue.
Five of the seven men being released this week are serving sentences
for possessing arms, the others for armed robbery.
Those being freed were named in Dublin last night as Michael O'Reilly,
39, from Cork, and Declan O'Neill, 29, Matthew O Treasaigh, 29, Eamon O
Cleirigh, 30, and Seamus Ennis, 30, all from Dublin and all sentenced to
eight years for possessing arms, and John Kelehan, 23, and Kenneth
Bolger, 32, both from Dublin, serving seven and eight-year terms
respectively for armed robbery.
All will leave from the high-security Portlaoise prison, 50 miles from
Dublin in County Laois, tomorrow morning.
Mrs Owen, who gave the go-ahead for the releases after a Cabinet
meeting in Dublin yesterday, said the early freeing of ''carefully
selected'' prisoners serving sentences for terrorist offences was
''likely to make a significant contribution to maintaining the peace
process''.
The Northern Ireland Office had no comment last night about the
decision of the Irish Government to release the prisoners.
The British Government, in the face of Unionist politicians' outrage
at the continuing releases south of the border, has maintained the line
that there are no political prisoners in Northern Ireland and people
convicted by the courts had to expect to serve out their sentences.
It expressed just that line yesterday after the release of a report by
the Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of
Offenders calling for the early release of politically motivated
prisoners.
The report said peace in Northern Ireland would remain fragile while
large numbers of paramilitary prisoners were in jail.
Mrs Owen stressed the need for all parties involved in the Northern
Ireland peace process to ''move forward''.
Commenting in Dublin on her decision to authorise the early release
from prison of seven more IRA men, she said: ''It is important that the
British Government, Sinn Fein, the Unionists, and the Irish Government
all play their part.
''It is absolutely essential for all sides to move forward and not
continue to look back.''
Mrs Owen, who has now freed more than 20 jailed terrorists, leaving
just 35 still in jail on the southern side of the border, said she
believed it would be wrong to look for ''little gestures'' such as the
handing over by the IRA of some arms.
Meanwhile, European Commission President Jacques Santer last night
highlighted Europe's full support for the Northern Ireland peace
process.
In a speech to a session of the Irish Government's National Forum for
Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin, Mr Santer said the Commission would
join the bid to achieve a permanent peace.
He declared: ''My message is one of solidarity with all the efforts
being made -- in Dublin, in Belfast, and in London -- by both
governments, by political parties, by groups and organisations, by
courageous individuals.''
* Permanent vehicle checkpoints around the Army's Bessbrook base in
south Armagh are to be removed today in another sign of the relaxation
in security policy.

THE Government yesterday won an important High Court victory over the
introduction of restrictions which prevent jobless foreigners -- and
British expatriates returning from abroad -- from claiming state
benefits.
In three linked test cases, the court said new rules introduced to
stop so-called benefit tourism were valid in both European and domestic
law and Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley was entitled to apply
them.
Lord Justice Balcombe, sitting with Mr Justice French, dismissed
challenges by a Pakistani with British nationality, an Ethiopian
naturalised as a French citizen, and two Germans denied benefits because
they were not ''habitually resident'' in Britain.
Lawyers for all four involved in the three cases claimed it was
outside the Government's powers to introduce the concept of habitual
residence and people were eligible to claim benefits simply by being ''a
person in Great Britain''.
However, Lord Justice Balcombe said: ''It seems to me quite impossible
to say that Parliament intended every person physically present in Great
Britain to be eligible for income support.''
Referring specifically to European law, he said: ''There is nothing
unusual in the concept that rights of movement and rights of residence
within the Community do not necessarily carry with them rights of
maintenance.''
Opponents of the habitual residence test, introduced by the 1994
Income Related Benefits Schemes (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No 3)
Regulations, say the restrictions are leaving returning unemployed
expatriates, British passport holders, and others entitled to live in
the country in danger of destitution, as well as hitting other EU
nationals.
More than 1000 cases are currently before social security benefits
tribunals.
Lawyers for blind Choudhrey Sarwar, 62, of Bradford, argued that he
was entitled to have his claims considered without being subjected to
the habitual residence test.
Mr Sarwar lived in the UK for 13 years until 1976, when he returned to
Pakistan. He had acquired British nationality in 1975 and returned to
England last August to seek medical treatment to restore his eyesight.
He was refused income support a month later, on the grounds that he
was not habitually resident in the UK, and applied for judicial review.
The second case involved Michael Getachew, 20, of Finsbury Park, north
London, who was adopted by French parents and raised in France from the
age of four.
After completing his education last year, he spent three months
unsuccessfully looking for work in France before coming to England in
September, where he was equally unsuccessful in finding a job.
Yesterday, the judges ruled that not only was he barred from claiming
income support -- his application was refused by an adjudication officer
last November after he failed the habitual residence test -- but also
was not entitled to an ''urgent cases'' payment or to any other interim
payment out of social security funds.
The third test case involved unemployed German draughtsman Mr Jan
Urbanek, 35, and his mother Inga, 64, of Streatham, south-west London.
Mr Urbanek lived and for some time worked in England between 1990 and
1992 before returning to Germany. In September last year, he came back
to England, intending to find work, and brought over his mother.
The same month, both applied for income support but were refused on
the basis of the habitual residence test.

bacterium in East Lothian.
A four-year-old Tranent girl and her two-year-old sister, who have not

A spokesman for Lothian Health said yesterday that the girls had spent
time at the Haddington home of 21-month-old Stephen Johnston, who is
still seriously ill at the same hospital.
The boy's mother, Jeanette Marr, who has also tested positive, has not
been affected.
The spokesman described the two sisters' conditions as
''satisfactory'' and said investigations were continuing to trace the
cause of the outbreak.

Adelaide, Tuesday
IN what sounds like a throwback to the founding of Australia more than
two centuries ago, Britons are to run a prison in the former colony.
The South Australian government today named British security company
Group 4 as the winner of a bid to manage the 100-bed Mount Gambier
prison.
First British settlers landed at the site of present-day Sydney in
1788 to found a prison colony. Britain needed a new dumping ground for
its undesirables after losing its American colonies.
Group 4 manages two private prisons and a prison transport contract in
Britain.
Wayne Matthew, Minister for correctional services, told the state
parliament in Adelaide that the deal ensured taxpayers would pay less
for imprisonment, while the government obtained a higher standard of
rehabilitation and work in prison.
He said the company, which has been in existence for more than 80
years, operated in some 30 countries, employed more than 32,000 people
and turned over in excess of #360m a year.
The bid was approved by Cabinet ahead of other submissions, including
one by the existing staff at the prison.
The decision to privatise has angered the state opposition Labour
Party and the Democrats, who called the move a ''backward step''.--AP.

Cape Town, Tuesday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela's estranged wife Winnie, sacked from the
South African Government last month, is suing him for immediate
reinstatement as deputy Arts Minister.
''We can confirm that a summons was delivered at the Union Buildings.
The president has been informed and he will now have to seek legal
advice,'' said presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana.
The president, who is visiting the Gulf, is due back in South Africa
on Thursday.
In papers before the Pretoria Supreme Court, Mrs Mandela says her
sacking was unlawful and unconstitutional. She also wants the president
to put in writing his reasons for dismissing her.
Mrs Mandela's lawyer, Willie Seriti, said civil summonses had been
delivered to the president's office and to Mrs Mandela's successor as
Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science, and Technology, Brigitte
Mabandla, who confirmed that she had received it.
Siriti's partner, Moses Mavundla, said the application was backed by
the president's main black political rival and coalition partner,
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
''Mr Buthelezi states in the affidavit that he was not consulted, as
the constitution requires, on the decision to dismiss Mrs Mandela,'' he
said.
President Mandela has been given until Thursday to say if he intends
to oppose the application. If he fails to respond by then the matter has
been set down for April 25.
Mankahlana said Mandela had consulted his own legal advisers before he
dismissed his wife on March 27 and said there could be no doubt about
the legality of his action.
''The constitution is very clear that the president has the
prerogative to hire ministers and to dismiss them,'' he said.
Mandela gave no reason for the sacking, saying he acted both as head
of state and as president of the ANC, which dominates South Africa's
post-apartheid government of national unity.
Official sources said Mrs Mandela, a consistent critic of the
government, was sacked mainly because she defied the president's order
earlier this year to cancel a trip to West Africa to attend a film
festival.--Reuter.

Nordhausen, Germany
FORMER inmates and US veterans yesterday marked the 50th anniversary
of the liberation of Mittelbau Dora, the secret underground camp where
slave labourers were worked to death making Nazi V2 rockets.
Around 20,000 died as a result of the inhuman conditions -- about
one-third of the camp's workforce, and far fewer than the 5000 victims
the rockets claimed when fired at British cities.
Some 800 survivors, veterans, and politicians laid wreaths at the
camp's crematorium and at the entrance to the dingy 10-mile tunnel
network where the prisoners worked on one of the most advanced
technologies of the time.
''Here the highest level of human ingenuity and the lowest level of
humanity that have ever existed met,'' said historian Eberhard Jaeckel,
chairman of the trust administering the site of Mittelbau Dora and its
parent death camp at Buchenwald.
The V2 was developed by Wernher von Braun, who perpetuated the legacy
of Mittelbau Dora after the war when he passed the technology to the
United States and directed its space programme.
For many of the survivors, it was the first time they had returned to
their place of torment.
''This is the cold and the smell I remember,'' said Georg Stein, a
Hungarian Jew imprisoned in Mittelbau Dora in 1944 along with others
from 40 countries.
He recalled 12-hour shifts checking V2 steering mechanisms with frozen
hands, flanked by roll-calls lasting many hours.
''There were no toilets, there was no water, and the lights burned day
and night,'' said Etienne Eckert, a Belgian ex-prisoner.
By early 1945, Mittelbau Dora was producing around 690 V2s per month.
The monthly death toll among prisoners in the first three months of that
year averaged 2000. Most were Russian, French, or Polish. Thousands of
others deemed unfit to work were shipped off to other Nazi death camps.
The US troops who arrived to find dead bodies littered around the
plant were shocked at the scale of the horror, but also at the attitude
of the local population.
''When we forced them to look at the piles of corpses they said they
didn't know anything about it,'' said US veteran Weldon Limmroth. ''I
don't believe that to this day.''--Reuter.

New York, Tuesday
TWO Americans jailed for eight years for crossing the Iraqi border
from Kuwait are ''seething with anger'' over the UN's reported admission
that one of its border guards failed to stop them from going
accidentally into Iraq.
Cable News Network correspondent Brent Sadler, reporting from Baghdad,
said he had talked with David Daliberti and William Barloon and they
expressed bitterness over the UN mistake.
''Both men are very angry that the UN had taken so long to make that
important admission,'' Sadler reported.
''They feel that if things had been different, the UN could have
quietly moved them away from the area and not allowed the situation to
have spilled over to within earshot of Iraqi guards, who eventually
picked them up and detained them.''
Sadler also reported after his second visit to the Americans: ''Bill
Barloon seems to be in better shape, both physically and mentally; he's
certainly more in control of his situation.''
Barloon, 39, also remains defiant, telling Sadler: ''I am determined
not to kowtow to the Iraqis; I intend to remain strong and to give Dave
all my support so we see this thing through together.''
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters in Washington that
Iraq was granting weekly access to the two men by Polish diplomats
representing the United States in Baghdad.
''But it's no substitute for their release, which we continue to press
for intensely,'' said McCurry, while stressing that the US would not
negotiate.
He claimed it was not entirely coincidental that Iraq granted press
access to the men just after a UN commission found Baghdad had yet to
comply with resolutions requiring it to rid itself of weapons of mass
destruction.
Daliberti, 41, who has health problems, was visited today by heart
specialists, eye specialists, and a GP, CNN reported.
Daliberti said he had had three heart seizures since being arrested on
March 13 and felt that the blindfold he wore after his arrest injured
his eyes.
An Iraqi criminal court sentenced the two on March 25 and an Iraqi
lawyer defending them is expected to appeal soon.
Sadler, who last visited the prisoners 13 days ago, was told they
shared a 6ft by 8ft cell, open to a common area. Their cell block holds
up to 300 prisoners of various Arab nationalities, none of whom speaks
English.--Reuter.

Gaza, Tuesday
PLO chief Yasser Arafat intensified the biggest crackdown on Islamic
groups of his 10-month-old rule of Gaza today in an attempt to halt
suicide attacks against Israelis.
Police rounded up scores of Islamists. A military court also sentenced
one militant to life imprisonment for inciting attacks.
Militant Muslims accused Arafat of buckling under Israeli and US
pressure to save a peace accord with the Jewish state which was all but
dead.
Sources in the fundamentalist Hamas and Islamic Jihad group said
tension in Gaza was the highest it had been since Israeli troops
withdrew from most of the Strip last year to enable Arafat to return.
PLO sources said Arafat had no choice but to salvage his self-rule
deal with Israel.
Squads of his 18,000-strong police force rounded up Islamic activists
and sympathisers although many senior leaders were left alone or avoided
arrest, the sources said. About 200 people were in detention.
The round-up began on Sunday after Hamas and Islamic Jihad suicide car
bombers killed seven Israeli soldiers and a US student travelling to
Jewish settlements in Gaza.
Palestinian officials said they would partly disarm Muslim militants
and set a deadline of May 11 for gun-holders to register weapons.
''The police will collect any unlicensed weapons after this period,''
said Gaza Police Chief Ghazi al-Jabali.
Islamic Jihad issued a statement saying its guerrillas would not hand
over arms.
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists said they were worried by the
crackdown but they believed attacks against Israeli targets would
continue.
However they said they wanted to avoid sliding into a Palestinian
civil war, which would only serve Israel.
In Gaza City, police fired shots in the air when protesters marched
down the streets chanting ''Allahu Akbar'' (God is Great) to protest
against the arrests.
Prosecutor General Khaled al-Kidra said that Islamic Jihad activist
Omar Shallah, 29, was sentenced to life by a recently established
military court for inciting people to carry out suicide operations.
The court sentenced another Islamic Jihad man on Sunday to 15 years in
jail after convicting him of training children as young as 10 as
guerrillas.
Washington, sponsor of the Middle East peace process, has welcomed the
new tribunal, but lawyers criticised it for violating basic legal
rights.
''The situation is getting very bad and if it is not solved quickly in
a correct manner there could be an explosion,'' said Imad Falouji, a
Hamas leader. Meanwhile, Hamas's military wing said Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin would pay for the crackdown.
''Hamas calls on him also to prepare as many coffins as possible for
his soldiers and his settler pigs, because our response towards these
arrests will be against our primary enemy and it will come as soon as
possible and in the midst of the Zionist entity,'' it said.
Israel welcomed the crackdown but claimed more was needed.

Brussels, Tuesday
EUROPEAN Union and Canadian negotiators held fresh talks tonight in an
effort to resolve their North Atlantic fishing dispute.
However it emerged at the talks that differences remained within the
EU as to the solution, according to Canadian officials.
''It was our impression that the Union still faces internal
difficulties,'' said Jennifer Sloan, spokeswoman for the Canadian
External Trade Department.
She said the talks were held with a view to clarifying what was
understood by a draft agreement reached last week and that no new
negotiations on substance had been held.
The talks took place after Canada said it would take action unless a
solution were found by tomorrow.
The EU is seeking to thrash out a position to satisfy Spain, which
faces severe pressure from its domestic fishing industry not to cave in
over how much Greenland halibut, or turbot, it can catch off
Newfoundland.
However Spanish diplomats had earlier hinted for the first time that
there might be some flexibility in Madrid's position.
One said that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez had agreed to a reduced
catch, which could leave hope for movement in the talks.
Madrid wants the EU to have 13,500 tonnes of this year's quota for the
disputed area -- half the entire permitted catch -- all of which would
go to Spain and Portugal.
Spain alone netted more than twice as much as this last year and fears
that anything less will threaten the livelihood of thousands of
fishermen in its Galicia region.
Two hours of face-to-face talks today failed to produce an accord and
Canada said the onus was now on the 15 EU states to agree among
themselves to accept a solution.
The European Commission retorted that it could not negotiate on the
basis of an ultimatum, and Spanish officials said any EU flexibility
would have to be met by Canada.
EU foreign ministers failed to agree the deal at a meeting in
Luxembourg yesterday, prompting Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin
to threaten possible action by tomorrow to protect fish off his
country's shores.
In Ottawa, his spokeswoman Bonnie Mewdell confirmed: ''As he said
yesterday, he'll take whatever measures are necessary to protect the
stock.''
Tomorrow, she said, after European ambassadors had discussed the
issue, Tobin would then confer with Prime Minister Jean Chretien and
other Canadian ministers to decide what to do.
The rest of the EU will soon be facing the same problems as Canada as
they give broader access to Spanish factory trawlers, which fishermen on
both sides of the Atlantic accuse of scooping up just about everything

PROPOSALS to improve the training of candidates for the Church of
Scotland ministry are to be put before its General Assembly next month.
The Kirk's department of education, giving the findings of a review
group, says in its report to the Assembly that there should be a
combination of practical and academic studies.
A proposed course would be a theological degree with practical
training placements sandwiched into it and counting towards its award.
There would be an end to probationary training -- at present, a period
of 18 months alongside a parish minister -- and also to part-time
attachments.
Instead, there would be three large block full-time placements,
ranging from seven to 12 months. All would be closely supervised by both
university and Church staff. Residential courses would be introduced.
The report says that although such a degree with placements would be a
new development for the Scottish university divinity faculties, it is
not new to other professions or denominations.
Education and training for the ministry should continue to be done at
the four universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St Andrews.
The interweaving of theory and practice, it is claimed, should produce
better-prepared ministers than does the present course, which largely
separates theory in the university degree from practice in the
probationary period.
A key feature would be the emphasis on using supervisors who are
well-trained in how to enable others to learn the skills and practice of
ministry.
The church would be responsible for training supervisors and paying
candidates a salary during placements.
The inclusion of this ability to earn within the university years
would relieve some of the severe financial difficulties all students
experience with the present level of grants and loans, says the report.
Statistics show that 56 students for the ministry are expected to
complete their course this year. The total number of students this year
-- 129 -- shows a decrease of 17 on last year's figure.

A FARM labourer who raped a pregnant woman after a row over the
paternity of the child was jailed for four years yesterday.
Lord Clyde told David Howden, 24: ''You have pleaded guilty to a
serious offence which was obviously distressing in the extreme to your
victim, particularly bearing in mind her condition at the time.
''The concern you had about the identity of the father of the child is
no ground for the kind of conduct you engaged in.''
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Howden, described as a prisoner,
admitted raping the woman, then 20, at a caravan site in Fife on
February 17 this year.
Mr Michael O'Grady, advocate-depute, told the court that Howden had
formed a sexual relationship with the woman after meeting her in
England. Her family disapproved and the couple had moved to Scotland at
the beginning of this year.
They had a series of quarrels as the relationship began to
deteriorate. They were arguing into the early hours at the time of the
rape.
The woman had gone into the bedroom section of the caravan, intending
to go to bed, but Howden followed her and pushed his way in as she tried
to close the door. He punched her four or five times in the face. The
victim said she thought that she had blacked out.
When she came to, Howden ordered her to take her clothes off and lie
on the floor before raping her. She tried to resist by pushing and
scratching him.
Afterwards, he fell asleep and she escaped to a neighbouring caravan.
Howden admitted to police that he had assaulted and raped the woman.
Mr Branislav Sudjic, solicitor-advocate, appearing for Howden, said
there had been arguments over the woman's pregnancy and on the day
before the incident his client had drunk a bottle of vodka.
Howden claimed the victim had told him that she didn't think the child
was his and had become incensed.
Mr Sudjic added: ''He accepts fully that he did an awful thing.''
Lord Clyde told Howden: ''I accept that you realise the awful nature
of the crime you committed and you do have regret and remorse for it.''

<HEADLINE>Shift changes 'strained officers' marriage'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978927874</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE way marriage affects two police officers working out of the same
station was explored yesterday at an industrial tribunal.
On the one hand, the couple involved argued that shifts which did not
coincide left them with virtually no time together.
On the other, the force pointed out the legal difficulties that could
arise if, for example, the husband and wife were on patrol together and
one of them was accused of assault. Scots law could not require the
other to testify and, in any case, a defence solicitor could suggest
collusion.
Constable Sandy Dunnett, 42, and his wife Audrey, 28, met in December
1992 and married last August. Before the wedding, they had done a tour
of duty on Skye, generally managing to share shift patterns.
Four days before their wedding, they were told they would no longer be
working the same shifts, the tribunal in Portree heard.
Both constables, who move away next week from Skye to a new beat in
Thurso, say the decision by Northern Constabulary to move them on to
different shifts put their marriage under strain.
Mr Dunnett is claiming compensation for injured feelings at the
tribunal, saying the police force discriminated against him because of
his marital status.
The tribunal adjourned after completion of his evidence. It will
resume, probably in Inverness, on a date in August still to be fixed.
Mr Dunnett said it was well known among senior officers that he had a
close relationship with Audrey and their shifts remained similar.
In March 1994, they announced they were going to get married, which
prompted the comment from one duty sergeant: ''That's going to give me
some difficulties as I will have to change your shifts.''
Mr Dunnett said: ''I didn't understand why. I was concerned that it
may affect our quality of life as a couple.''
Four days before they were due to marry, he was told by an acting
inspector that he would definitely be working different shifts when he
returned from honeymoon.
Mr Dunnett said: ''I was taken aback. Due to the time lapse, I thought
the matter had been conveniently dropped. Audrey was also very upset. It
also meant that we weren't going to be able to enjoy the company
together of our friends and shift partners.
''It also meant an end to our weekends away together, or visiting our
parents in Caithness. We only saw each other for a few hours. Our
sleeping was disturbed, as one would be in bed after a night shift as
the other was going out to begin day shift.
''The only time we got together was if we managed to arrange it
ourselves through taking time off in lieu of overtime or public
holidays.''
Mr Dunnett said he invoked the force's equal opportunities grievance
procedure but did not see any point in continuing it.
He explained that the force's operations commander, Chief
Superintendent Pat Douglas, was the last port of appeal and the senior
officer had already decided not to alter the decision.
Mr Dunnett added: ''I was told if I wished I should take the matter to
an industrial tribunal with the goodwill of the senior officers.''
Mr Alan Simpson, solicitor for Northern Constabulary, raised the
force's reasons for being against married officers serving the same
shift.
He asked Mr Dunnett: ''Are you aware from your knowledge of the law
that spouses are not compellable witnesses if one has committed a crime?
''If you had two officers working together and a member of the public
made a complaint of assault, you could have one not compelled to give
evidence against the other.''
Mr Dunnett replied: ''I don't see that as a problem.''
Mr Simpson asked: ''Do you accept it is possible that a defence
solicitor could suggest collusion between a husband and wife?''
Mr Dunnett: ''He could suggest it whether they were husband and wife
or not.''
Mr Simpson: ''But an accused may be acquitted.''
Mr Dunnett: ''I would like to think a sheriff would look at the
credibility of witnesses and not marital status.''
Mrs Dunnett is now pregnant and began maternity leave last month.

ITV was urged yesterday to guard against excessive caution in its
scheduling and to take more risks with new programmes.
The call came from the Independent Television Commission, the
broadcasting watchdog, after the publication of its annual performance
review for Britain's commercial stations.
Because of the durable popularity of tried and tested shows in drama,
comedy, and light entertainment, the network stands accused of a lack of
innovation in the scheduling and commissioning of new shows.
Although drama output increased in 1994 and hit the #200m mark for the
first time, the total number of new programmes tried out during the year
fell by about one-third compared to 1993. Familiar titles like London's
Burning, Heartbeat, Soldier Soldier, and Peak Practice continued to
provide the solid bedrock for peak viewing slots.
ITC chief executive David Glencross called on the network to abandon
its policy of playing safe with the schedules. ITV, he said, could
afford to take occasional risks with one-offs. ''They don't need to win
every slot every night,'' he said.
Though there is an element of truth in the ITC remarks, it is fair to
point out that the review, which covers 1994, does not take into account
recent dramas which could be perceived as being ''risks''.
These have included the enormously successful Sunday night serial,
Band of Gold (originally turned down by the BBC) and last week's one-off
pilot, Turnaround.
Considering the deluge of adverse publicity which surrounded Granada
Television's Cracker, yesterday's report went out of its way to praise
the award-winning series. In several episodes it achieved ''a quality of
writing, performance, and direction unsurpassed elsewhere''. Though some
viewers found it too strong even after 9pm, a later scheduling time
would have ''denied it the large audience it deserved'', said the
report.
In general terms, however, the ITC reckoned the network was inclined
to race too quickly into adult material immediately after the 9pm
watershed.
The two Scottish stations, Scottish Television and Grampian, were
largely exempt from criticism in yesterday's report. STV sustained ''a
strong Scottish identity'' against a background of disappointing
advertising revenue. The ''very substantial amounts'' of local
programming were fulfilled and sales to the network continued at a high
level. It was also praised for its regional output and for an increase
in its audience share which exceeded the network average.
Grampian Television was highly praised for its news and current
affairs service.
Considering the diversity of cultures and the geographically
fragmented nature of the area, the ''consistently high quality of the
news and current affairs output was an impressive achievement'', said
the report.
The amount of factual and religious programmes were more than adequate
and the overall licence requirement was exceeded with new material.
Channel Four was congratulated for achieving a high quality of
programmes and large audiences in a number of areas. Its Film On Four
strand made a major contribution to the quality of the station's
schedule.

<HEADLINE>Promotion to York for the 'grey area' bishop</HEADLINE>

BISHOP of London Dr David Hope, who recently admitted his sexuality
was ''a grey area'', is to be the next Archbishop of York.
He will succeed Dr John Habgood when he retires in August after 11
years.
It is the second most senior post in the Church of England and his
appointment could intensify the debate about homosexuality but will also
delight many traditionalists: 54-year-old Yorkshireman Dr Hope, a
leading Anglo Catholic, opposed the introduction of women priests.
Last month, Dr Hope said his sexuality was a ''greyer'' area than that
of most people but that he had chosen to live a celibate life.
He was prompted to issue the statement by what he described as
''seriously intimidatory'' pressure from gay rights campaign OutRage!,
led by Mr Peter Tatchell.
At a news conference yesterday, Dr Hope said his appointment came as
''a very considerable surprise'' even to him, because of his commitment
to the London diocese.
He believed he should use his new role to encourage considered
discussion about homosexuality within the Church, the bishop said.
''It is my business to ensure that all who are involved are given a
proper voice and a proper ear, and there is a proper process of
listening to the debate,'' he said. ''At the present time, I am just a
little concerned that the debate is causing rather more heat than
light.''
Sexuality, however, had not been his ''main concern'', he emphasised.
At the time of the bishop's statement in response to the OutRage!
incident, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, led widespread
Church condemnation of what he called ''reprehensible intrusion'' into
Dr Hope's private life.
The Church's position is that homosexuals can be priests but they must
remain celibate.
Although strongly opposing women's ordination during its debate, Dr
Hope has since won admiration for the diplomatic way he has tried to
accommodate both sides in his London diocese.
''I have refrained from ordaining women but nevertheless attempted to
affirm and encourage the ministry of women,'' he said.
The bishop added: ''I hope that my appointment is a signal to the
Anglo Catholic movement that there is still a place and a space for
those of that tradition in the Church of England.''
Cardinal Basil Hume, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster,
commented: ''I warmly congratulate Bishop Hope on his appointment to the
See of York.''
However, Dr Hope's appointment was condemned by such disparate groups
as the Conservative Family Institute and OutRage! itself.
Mr Tatchell said it was ''scandalous'' for the Church to elevate a
bishop ''who endorses anti-gay discrimination''.
Dr Adrian Rogers, director of the Conservative Family Institute, and
prospective Tory parliamentary candidate for Exeter, said: ''It's a
highly unsuitable choice given the turmoil in the Church of England
about sexuality. This is yet another nail in the coffin of Christian
faith.''

Up to 60 royal apartments are
to be offered for rent on the open market, Buckingham Palace announced
yesterday.
A cottage in the Royal Paddocks at Hampton Court -- expected to be let
within three months -- and a second property, at the Old Barracks in
Kensington, are expected to raise about #35,000 a year from rent.
The furnished properties will be advertised and let through agents on
leases of between one and five years. Most are located outside security
cordons on royal estate.
Rent revenue will pay for property maintenance, saving taxpayers'
money, the palace claimed.
The Royal Household has recently completed a major review of
self-contained accommodation. A reduction of 60 -- from 265 -- in the
number of apartments allocated to employees is planned, as properties
become vacant.
Royal Household staff and pensioners are now charged 16.7% of their
salary or pension in rent.
The new arrangement, introduced last April, is being phased in as
employees join the Royal Household or transfer to a new
performance-related pay scheme.
In January this year, 58 of 151 staff with self-contained
accommodation were employed on the new contracts.
Rent from employees now amounts to about #400,000 and should increase
to about #700,000 a year.

A YOUTH led police on a high-speed car chase through Edinburgh just
four days after being banned from driving for life.
Bryan Douglas, 17, went through red lights and a roundabout as he
reached speeds of more than 90mph. He also rammed a patrol car which had
drawn level with his vehicle.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday, he was sentenced to 18 months'
detention.
Douglas, 16 at the time of the offences, finally crashed into railings
at Gogar Station Road after the four-and-a-half mile pursuit, writing
off the stolen Metro.
Sheriff Isobel Poole also imposed a supervised release order to
''protect the public from serious harm'' from him when his sentence
ends.
Douglas, described in court as a prisoner, had admitted stealing a
car, dangerous driving, failing to stop, driving while disqualified and
without insurance, and giving a false name, on July 8 last year.
He also admitted stealing a car on October 30, 1994, breaking into two
cars with intent to steal on October 15 and driving while disqualified
and without insurance on November 8.
Depute-fiscal Anne Keenan said Douglas had been sentenced to probation
and community service and banned for life four days previously at
Arbroath Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Isobel Poole backdated the sentence to November 8.

<HEADLINE>Report links radiation to Down's births</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978927879</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IT was claimed yesterday that low-dose radiation is a cause of mental
handicap in babies.
A report into the rise in the number of Down's Syndrome births
indicates a possible link to radioactive fallout from the testing of
nuclear weapons.
Paediatrician, Dr John Bound, of Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, who
carried out an investigation spanning 34 years in the North-west of
England, said the extra number of these births was not due to an
increased number of mothers over 35, a well-known risk factor for Down's
Syndrome.
The children studied came from the Fylde district of Lancashire.
Sellafield nuclear re-processing plant is about 70 miles north-west of
Blackpool, Lancashire.
During the study period from 1957-1991, the overall rate of Down's
Syndrome births was 1.35 per 1000, within the normal range. However,
there was a significant increase among babies conceived in 1963 and
1964, and a lesser peak in 1958. Both these peaks coincided with higher
levels of ionising radiation exposure which, during 1958, were possibly
enhanced by a fire at the former Windscale nuclear facility the year
before.
Fallout is roughly in proportion to the amount of annual rainfall and
the actual doses of radiation received were probably higher in the Fylde
district than the available national figures, according to the report in
the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.
Natural background radiation, medical X-rays, and discharges from
nuclear reactors and fallout from the atmospheric testing of nuclear
weapons are all important sources of ionising radiation.
There was no evidence of extra exposure to X-rays or from discharges
during either of the peak periods in the study.
Natural background radiation is fairly constant in a given area and
contributes to the dose received by the ovaries, where the abnormality
causing Down's Syndrome occurs in 80% of cases.
Dr Bound said: ''We have not found any definite link with Sellafield,
except possibly with the fire in 1957 which could have added to the
atomic weapons testing fallout.
''The main point is that this is further evidence that low-dose
radiation does cause Down's Syndrome.
''Hospitals should try and keep X-rays to a minimum and be careful
about the number carried out on girls of reproductive age. It is quite
clear it is the sum total of exposure in your lifetime that matters.''

SCHOOLS must do more to help young people develop self-confidence and
the skills for securing jobs, a major job survey led by the Scottish
Office Education Department has said.
About 17,000 members of the public in 12 Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development countries were questioned about their
attitudes to, and expectations of, schooling in the final years of
compulsory education.
The OECD report, published today, confirms that, in the public eye,
education is about much more than the teaching of traditional subjects,
although they are also seen as very important.
It raises important questions for member countries about the role of
schools and the purpose of teaching. The public has less confidence in
the effectiveness of schools in developing personal, social, and
vocational qualities, which it rates higher than curriculum subjects.
Of those surveyed in the UK, 89% thought developing self-confidence
was essential or very important for schools, compared with an average
over all 12 countries of 88.4%, while 91% thought developing skills and
knowledge for getting a job were essential, compared with an average of
85.5%.
Overall, countries rated such qualities and aptitudes higher than
curriculum subjects.
In response to questions about what should be taught in schools, 93%
in the UK said maths was essential compared with an average 84.6%, while
88% opted for native language, compared with an average of nearly 87%.
The UK and the United States were significantly behind other countries
in rating foreign languages as very important.
The so-called ''gap indicator'' is illustrated by findings which show
that public confidence in teaching important subjects is higher than in
the way schools develop qualities such as personal skills.
Helping pupils with difficulties in learning was seen by the public as
the priority to help schools achieve their goals. In the United Kingdom,
94% said this was most important, compared with an average 89%.
In the UK, 87% saw keeping parents informed and involved as important,
compared with 82% across the 12.
Nine out of 10 surveyed in the UK saw maintaining discipline as
essential or very important -- compared with an average 77% -- while 63%
put regular homework in these categories, compared with 57% across the
OECD countries.
Nearly 58% of all respondents thought teachers were very and fairly
respected. Only nine of the 12 asked the public whether they thought
teachers should be paid more or less than they currently earned. Two out
of three in the United States thought they should, compared with only
18% in Spain.
Only a small percentage thought they should earn less, while a
relatively high number said they were not sure.
The majority of respondents said school budgets should be devolved to
schools, something which will happen in all Scottish schools by April
next year.
In line with Government policy here, 50% of UK respondents said
teacher selection and promotion should be handled at school level, as
should the way subjects were taught. In Scotland, schools are issued
with guidelines on the teaching of the curriculum.
Scottish data has not been separated from the UK analysis. The SOED
has, however, conducted separate research which will be available
shortly to allow comparisons to be made between parental attitudes here
and other OECD countries.
Mr Archie McGlynn, chief inspector of Scottish schools who had a
leading role in the research project, said: ''We had far more things in
common than differences. There is a clear message of what people want
from schools. I did not expect to see that so strongly expressed across
such different systems, particularly the extent to which the public
perceives schooling to be about far more than traditional subjects.''

A SCRAMBLE for three stretches of Scotland's most attractive
forest-land, worth around #3.5m, is under way, with foreign investors
and several individuals already among the would-be buyers.
Only days after going on the market, 24 notes of interest in the
forests -- one in Perthshire and two in the Borders -- have been lodged
with the selling agents.
With tax benefits in forestry investment still available -- despite
Nigel Lawson's move to close loopholes in his 1988 Budget -- the
forests, part of a #5m portfolio of UK timber investment, were bound to
attract considerable interest.
Mr Lawson had bowed to pressure from environmentalists who attacked
tax-driven tree-planting in Scotland's Flow Country.
At that time, a number of well-known personalities, including Terry
Wogan, Cliff Richard, and snooker players Steve Davis and Alex Higgins,
were among investors in Scotland.
Yesterday, Mr Anthony Hart, of the Perth office of chartered surveyors
Bidwells, said formal notes of interest in the three forests had come in
from European-owned timber processors, foreign investors, UK pension
funds, UK-based family trusts, and ''at least one or two private
individuals''.
The big advantage of forestry investment is that timber income is free
of income tax. In addition, forestry businesses attract 100% relief from
inheritance tax.
Bidwells, which claims the forests have high income potential,
anticipates a closing date being set in about a month's time.
The portfolio is the remaining forestry investment of a major pension
fund. Bidwells was asked to appraise its original portfolio in 1987.
''We advised them to get rid of secondary locations and hold on to the
core and cream of their portfolio until the market improved. We have hit
it about right now through a bit of luck and a bit of judgment.''
Mr Hart said timber prices had ''shot up'' by 20% in the past 12
months and were still rising.
The largest of the forests up for sale is the 2255-acre Hyndhope
Forest near Selkirk. It is valued at #1.1m.
The second biggest is the 1800-acre Glenample Forest planted in
Perthshire in the 1980s. Sheltered by Ben Vorlich, it is valued at
#875,000.
The third area is the 1232-acre Eildrig Forest in Roxburghshire. It is
valued at #1.5m. Another three forest tracts in England have also been
put on the market.

THE wheels of government in Scotland ground to an undignified halt
yesterday when a power failure hit the Scottish Office.
Electric typewriters, telephones, and fax machines, went off --
stopping almost all communication to New St Andrew's House in Edinburgh.
Some staff were issued with mobile phones to make and take calls.
Exasperated, many of the 1000 staff left work early when it became
clear they could not carry out their duties.
At six o'clock, the masterswitch for the building's power system was
switched off as an investigation began.
From around noon, there had been only one public line into the
Scottish Office.
That was answered by workers in the Scottish Office control room who
politely told puzzled callers they were unable to put their call through
to the relevant department.
One Scottish Office worker said last night: ''The security staff has
been taking calls from the great and the good from all over Scotland.
They have been working harder than anyone today.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said the power system had partially failed
and telephone and fax connections, except for a very limited number for
emergency use, had been put out of action.
He added he hoped everything would be back to normal today. The power
failure did not affect workers at nearby Old St Andrew's House.

THE future of Glasgow's Meat Market was in doubt yesterday following
the collapse of a key company which left more than 40 people out of work
and debts estimated at #400,000.
Directors of the Glasgow Abattoir Company, which carried out all
slaughtering at the district council-owned market in the city's East
End, put the firm into voluntary liquidation earlier this week.
Employees, still owed a week's wages, were told of the decision on
Monday.
Mr Alan O'Boyle, of Glasgow chartered accountants Walkers, said: ''We
are winding the company up at the moment. The underlying problem was
that the company were just not getting enough throughput of beef for the
kill.
''The staff have been paid off. There is, however, no money for their
wages which are in arrears for a week.''
Mr O'Boyle said temporary arrangements had been put into place to
ensure slaughtering facilities, crucial to the viability of the market,
were available. He added: ''In the interim period, slaughtering will go
on.
''The largest customer and supplier, Ian Scott Meats, is taking
responsibility for the on-going slaughtering and that has been cleared
with the Ministry of Agriculture.''
He said the final reckoning of the debts was not complete but added:
''At the moment, we think it will be several hundred thousand pounds.
There will be fairly substantial debts but, at the moment, I don't think
we want to disclose who the creditors will be.''
Mr Tom Chiesa, Glasgow District Council's depute director of estates,
said it was too early to predict the consequences of the firm's
collapse.
''The whole meat market saga has been very sad for the council,'' he
said. ''We have tried our best over the years to keep it going and we
will continue to do that. We are looking to see what we can do to maybe
save the situation that has arisen. It is at the very early stage at the
moment and the matter will take some investigation.
''We have been talking to other people who may have something to put
on the table with regards to saving the situation. There may be
repercussions for the whole market but we have supported it for a number
of years and will continue to do so.''
The final phase of a #1m reconstruction of the market, making it one
of the most modern in Britain, was completed in 1989.
Since the 1970s, the abattoir has suffered a number of financial
setbacks, most notably when the Irish Government decided to build a
series of their own slaughter facilities, removing a significant part of
Glasgow's trade.
Although owned by Glasgow District Council, the market is operated by
the Glasgow Meat Market Company Ltd. Nobody was available for comment
from the firm yesterday.

HUNDREDS of prisoners in Scottish jails are signing petitions urging
the authorities to bend prison rules to allow the Ice Cream War
murderer, Thomas ''T C'' Campbell, to be supplied with food by his
family.
Campbell, serving a life sentence with a 20-year minimum before parole
consideration for the killing of six members of a Ruchazie, Glasgow,
family 10 years ago, has not eaten properly since he was transferred to
Shotts Prison from the Barlinnie Special Unit in January.
He has suffered serious weight loss and his transfer to a local
hospital is thought to be imminent. Campbell is refusing prison food,
claiming that he is being denied the facilities necessary to allow him
to continue his fight to prove that he was wrongly convicted --
facilities he enjoyed in the now-defunct Barlinnie Special Unit.
Transfer to Law Hospital would, however, allow Campbell to accept
food.
Campbell's corner is now being fought by Mr Ken Murray, a Strathclyde
regional councillor and formerly a prison officer closely identified
with the innovative, early years of the BSU.
A member of the Shotts Prison Visiting Committee, Mr Murray said
yesterday: ''I spoke to Thomas Campbell last week and his condition was
nothing short of appalling.''
He added: ''He has a total obsession that he is innocent. While the
prison service cannot be in the business of discussing guilt or
innocence, it should be giving people every opportunity to fight to
establish innocence. If people like this are not given the
opportunities, then in the long run it creates serious problems in the
prisons.
''I have discovered that in England in similar cases prisoners are
given total access to every legal book and facility. I find the
situation in Scotland astonishing.''
Campbell's sister, Mrs Agnes Lafferty, last night told The Herald that
she now had a petition from Greenock Prison with 78 names and one from
Shotts A and B Halls with around 120 names to add to that from C hall in
Shotts sent to Mr Murray. A petition began circulating yesterday in
Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, and another is expected to start in Perth
Prison today.
''I will be passing on all these names and numbers to Mr Murray and
everything will be sent to Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish Secretary. We
expect that this will be reinforced in the next few days by the
signatures of a large number of prominent academics who are disgusted by
the condition that Tommy has been allowed to sink into,'' Mrs Lafferty
said.
A SPS spokesman said last night that the prison rules approved by
Parliament did not allow for food to be brought in for any prisoner and
clearly they had to abide by that.
''We cannot make exceptions. It is up to any prisoner to make that
choice,'' he said.

AN inquiry is under way at Dungannon military base near Belfast into
the death of a young Scots airman.
The body of Mr Gordon Baird, 24, was found on the base at the weekend.
It is understood he had suffered gunshot wounds.
Mr Baird had been seconded to the tactical supply wing from his base
at RAF Stafford and was involved in the refuelling and rearming of
helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft which operate in Northern Ireland
and between the province and other RAF bases.
The news of his death was broken to his parents, Allan and Christine,
at their home in Blackburn Place, Ayr, by a senior RAF officer.
Last night they were too upset to talk about the tragedy.
A spokeswoman at the RAF Stafford supply base said: ''We can confirm
the death of a 24-year-old single airman who was attached to the
tactical supply wing in Northern Ireland following an incident at the
weekend.''
She said a board of inquiry into the death had been established. It
will be assisted by the RAF Police and Royal Ulster Constabulary.
She added: ''A coroner's inquest has been carried out and the body
released to the family for a funeral on Friday.''
The RAF say that, although inquiries are continuing, there is no
evidence of a crime having been committed.

A WOMAN who suffocated her two children as they slept in their beds
was jailed for life yesterday.
Maxine Robinson, 26, murdered her 19-month-old daughter, Christine,
and son, Anthony, five months, within minutes of each other by placing
pillows over their faces.
Judge Mr Justice Mitchell made no comment to Robinson as he passed
sentences of life imprisonment for each of the two murders.
After Robinson was led away in tears, he told the jury it had been a
''very long, very difficult, and very painful trial''.
A three-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court heard how two and a half
hours after suffocating the children, she had told her husband Peter,
31, with no sign of emotion: ''I think the bairns are dead.''
Robinson, of Ouston, near Chester-le-Street, County Durham, had
suffered the cot death of her nine-month-old daughter, Victoria, from an
earlier marriage, four years before.
However, the jury of six men and six women rejected suggestions that
the two children could have been victims of a double cot death.
They took more than 10 hours over two days to find Robinson guilty of
the killings, for which the prosecution said there was no apparent
motive.
Robinson appeared stunned as the 11-1 majority verdicts were returned
and moments later collapsed sobbing into the arms of a woman prison
officer.
The jury had been told how, as her former security guard husband and
neighbours made frantic efforts to revive the children, Robinson had sat
motionless downstairs and made no attempt to help.
The Crown said the efforts to resuscitate the youngsters were doomed
to failure because they had died two and a half hours earlier.
Their father had carried the sleeping children to bed in their
different bedrooms on June 29, 1993, after they had spent a ''gloriously
sunny day'' playing in a paddling pool in the garden.
Robinson had gone into each bedroom in turn and placed a pillow over
the faces of the children.
She had then calmly gone downstairs and watched television and later
gone into the garden with her husband.
Later in the evening, she contrived a way of pretending to discover
the children had died by claiming she had heard her little boy crying.
Robinson gave an account to police, which was ''riddled and peppered
with flaws'', of how she knew the children were dead without touching
them or going near them.
However, the Crown said her story could not be believed because after
the earlier cot death of her daughter she received intense training in
resuscitation.
Yet, according to her explanation, rejected by the jury, she had not
even touched the two children.
A leading pathologist called by the defence, Professor Bernard Knight
of the University of Wales, said he knew of 30 cases involving double
cot deaths -- but in each case the children involved had been twins.
The judge told jurors as they retired to consider verdicts that they
had to be sure that Robinson had caused the children's deaths and that
husband Peter had not caused them.
Mr Robinson, himself arrested three times for questioning with his
wife over the deaths, told the court during lengthy cross-examination
that because he had not harmed the children he knew his wife must have
murdered them.
After the deaths, the couple were driven from their home by a hate
campaign.
Mr Robinson now lives in Peterlee, some distance away. He was not in
court to hear the verdicts returned on his wife.
After the case, police admitted they were no nearer to knowing what
drove Robinson to kill her two children than they were at the start of
the investigation.
Detective Chief Inspector Fred Taylor, of County Durham Police, said:
''It is anybody's guess. Two psychiatrists' reports showed she was quite
normal. If they could not come up with a reason, I am not in a position
to be able to say why she did it.''
The investigation was one of the most difficult and detailed ever
conducted by the force.
Mr Taylor said there were no plans to look any further into the cot
death of Robinson's first daughter. There was no evidence to suggest
that was anything other than a tragic cot death.
As Robinson's solicitor, Mrs Jan McKenzie, left court, she issued a
brief statement saying: ''Maxine Robinson and her family are devastated
by this jury's verdict. They are too devastated to think of the
future.''

Graham Wyn Jones, until 16
months ago an assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner, was fined
#400 yesterday for stealing food and wine worth #24 from a Marks and
Spencer store.
He was convicted of walking off with two bottles of wine, two pieces
of cheese, and a packet of chicken breasts in Chelsea in March last
year. He had #1700 in his pocket at the time.
Judge Gerald Butler told him at Southwark Crown Court: ''It is always
a sad matter having to sentence a person who has, in middle age, been
convicted of a crime after a hitherto blameless life. But, in truth, the
evidence against you was overwhelming.''
A store detective had watched Jones, 50, as he visited various
counters, picking up items and putting them in two Marks &amp; Spencer
carrier bags he was pushing around in a trolley.
He was stopped outside and had to be ''manhandled'' back into the
store.
After being taken to the manager's office, he was again physically
restrained after he appeared to make a run for it.
Receipts were recovered for all the items found in the bags, with the
exception of those named in the charge.
He was taken by policemen he used to command to Chelsea police
station, where he told one of them: ''The last few hours have been an
absolute nightmare, one's worst nightmare come true.''
The incident occurred four months after he was dismissed from his
#67,000 a year post, despite surviving allegations about links with
businessmen.
In his evidence, the once highly respected career officer insisted it
had all been a ''big mistake''.
Jones, of Belgravia, who described himself to the jury as an
''ill-disciplined shopper'', agreed he at first said he had purchased
all the items in the Kings Road store.
Later, upon reflection, he felt some of those items might have been
bought at other Marks &amp; Spencer stores earlier that afternoon.
However, having carefully considered the matter, he now believed he
had made all his purchases -- needed for a dinner party he and his wife
were having that night -- in one place. He may have made up to three
different trips through the checkouts to do so.
He also claimed he made a fourth tour of the store to make sure what
he had bought tallied with what his wife had ''instructed'' him to buy.
He went on to speak of his ''shock, humiliation, shame, and horror''
at being accused of shoplifting and said he was left ''absolutely
distraught''.
Jones's counsel, Mr Jeremy Donn, told the judge his client's real
punishment was his conviction. He went on: ''For him that will weigh
very heavily indeed.''
The barrister added that his client had not ''troubled the public
purse'' to pay for his defence.

<HEADLINE>Minister promises no 'mentally ill sleeping under archways' after Scots hospital closures    Adequate psychiatric care pledged</HEADLINE>

PSYCHIATRIC hospitals in Scotland will not be closed before adequate
alternative facilities for patients can be provided in the community,
the Government pledged yesterday.
The Scottish Health Minister, Lord Fraser, admitted that the closure
of mental hospitals under the Care in the Community (CIC) programme in
England and Wales -- which led to several prominent cases of patients
receiving inadequate after-care -- had been too rapid.
He said it was vital that Scottish authorities adopted a more
considered approach to avoid making the same mistakes.
CIC is more advanced in England and Wales than in Scotland and has
been widely criticised for being too ambitious in its hospital closure
programme south of the border.
Speaking at the annual conference of the Scottish Association for
Mental Health (SAMH) in Glasgow, Lord Fraser said there would be no
cases of the ''mentally ill sleeping under archways and in doorways'' in
Scotland.
He added that he was well aware of concern that new community services
should be established ''before old, out-dated, institutionalised forms
of care are replaced''.
The Scottish Office is seeking a reduction in the number of long-stay
beds in mental hospitals from the present 13,000 to 5000 by the end of
the decade, and three hospitals are earmarked for closure under CIC.
These are Gartloch, in Glasgow, Woodilee, near Lenzie, and Kingseat,in
Aberdeen.
Lord Fraser stressed that he had no fixed view on the annual
reduction, emphasising again that it was more important to consider the
appropriate level of community provision than the reduction in the
number of hospital places.
Addressing a number of concerns shared by SAMH and other
organisations, he said the Scottish Office was determined that no mental
patient leaving a hospital should be denied suitable care.
Lord Fraser said the Scottish Office had introduced an arrangement to
provide vulnerable people suffering from a long-term illness with the
full range of services needed, adding that ''a properly designed and
managed individual package of care must be in place in the community
before such a person is discharged from hospital''.
Dr Donald Dick, a former director of the Health Advisory Service in
England and Wales who also addressed the conference, warned of the
''grave consequences'' of failing to provide psychiatric patients with
adequate care.
He highlighted the case of a patient with a history of mental illness
receiving inadequate care during the CIC programme in England and Wales
-- that of Christopher Clunis, a paranoid schizophrenic, who stabbed a
man to death at a London Underground station and who is now in a secure
hospital.
The conference was told earlier that the Scottish Office had
introduced a new funding structure for community care and that more than
#620m would be made available to local authorities in 1995-96 to meet
their community care responsibilities.
Lord Fraser added that about #60m had already been made available in
bridging finance to assist health boards with extra running costs
incurred by hospitals while new community care services are being
developed, although only #20m had been taken up.
This was probably because the number of facilities being developed in
the community ''was not moving forward as quickly as it might be''.
His comments were generally welcomed by SAMH but officials were
disappointed he did not support calls for an overall Scottish Office
strategy for providing CIC services to ensure that social work
departments and health boards were better co-ordinated.
They fear that the provision of care outside Scottish hospitals will
be fragmented and inadequate but he believes such a strategy would be
too restrictive and would not allow councils to adapt provision to suit
their individual needs.
The Government would continue to promote co-operation between the care
agencies and to monitor the quality and level of services available in
the years ahead.
Ms Allyson McCollam, policy officer with SAMH, said: ''One of the
dangers is that if it is left to local assessments there will be a very
great difference in the range and quality of provision across Scotland
and the end result will be disparities in the sort of services people
receive just based on where they live.''

A VIOLENT mental patient released into care in the community against
the recommendations of his doctor and the Home Secretary was yesterday
sent to Broadmoor for battering and stabbing to death his girlfriend.
Detective Sergeant Adrian Tudway told an Old Bailey judge that there
was no mechanism anywhere in the country for police to be informed when
people were released into the community from mental hospitals.
As he ordered 32-year-old Luke Warm Luke, who changed his name from
Michael Folkes, to be detained indefinitely at the top security
hospital, the Recorder of London, Judge Lawrence Verney said he hoped
the prosecution would take this up with the Home Office.
It is understood the issue of informing local police when mental
patients are released into the community will soon be discussed by the
Crown Prosecution Service and the Home Office.
Luke Warm Luke, with a history of mental illness and violence to
women, including rape, was first diagnosed as mentally ill in the 1980s.
In 1986, he was ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental
Health Act for a series of woundings and sent to Park Lane secure
hospital in Liverpool. He was eventually transferred to the Bethlem
Hospital, Croydon, from where he was released in 1993.
Luke Warm Luke was given a council flat in Herne Hill, south London,
and it was there he killed his girlfriend, mother-of-four Susan
Crawford.

RESEARCHERS within the British Medical Association have cast doubts on
the worth of the NHS internal market and competition produced by
Government health reforms.
The health policy and economic research unit fears it falls between
being a true market in healthcare and a centrally planned system.
The concern comes in a discussion paper on future models of the NHS
produced by the unit.
The paper, however, says some commentators believe the NHS reforms
have strengthened primary care: by employing more practice nurses;
developing more specialist clinics; and increasing health promotion.
In addition, the quality of hospital care has improved, waiting times
have been reduced, and general practitioners are seen to be
''increasingly warming to the new power'' that has been given to them by
fundholding or involvement in commissioning services.
The problem, says the report, is proving the reforms created a better
service.
It explains: ''It could be argued that the efficiency drives of the
1980s, which did not involve competition or the purchaser/provider
split, were beginning to take effect and the claims made for the
improved performance of the NHS actually result from increased funding
and greater need for certain services rather than the benefits of
competition.''
The paper puts forward three options for future models for the NHS.
The first gives a continuing role to the market and the
purchaser/provider split; the second suggests hospitals and community
health services should not be self-governing; and the third proposes the
abolition of the purchaser/provider split and putting the management of
secondary care out to tender.

DEVELOPERS and councillors found themselves in a planning tangle
yesterday as plans for a #160m retail development at Braehead, Glasgow,
were rejected, mainly on the grounds of adverse effect on existing
shopping centres.
Members of Strathclyde region's planning committee rejected by nine
votes to six a #160m revised version of the scheme, scaled down in
response to a harsher economic climate, which would have had a
less-severe impact on Paisley, Renfrew, and Glasgow stores.
However, the development company, Braehead Park Ltd, a partnership of
Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury, will now have to proceed with the
larger #225m plan for which they already have planning consent from the
Scottish Secretary.
While expressing disappointment over yesterday's decision, a spokesman
for the developers, Mr Simon Webster, said his company was committed to
developing the site on which it had already spent #20m in respect of
land acquisition, site decontamination, and professional fees.
He said: ''We're very disappointed that the revised application with a
reduced retail impact, and what we saw as more appropriate leisure use,
has not been approved by the regional council. We will therefore
continue to build the scheme for which we have a detailed planning
permission.
''There's no question of appealing the decision. We will review all
the options but we are clear that we will build the original scheme.''
Among the amendments to the original scheme was a reduction in total
retail floor space from 975,000sq ft to 625,000, providing a
multi-purpose sports facility more in tune with local needs -- instead
of a 4000-seat ice rink -- and increasing car parking from 6000 to 8000
spaces.
According to officials, this would result in a ''sea'' of parked
vehicles around the shopping development. They were adamant the revised
version was, like the original, clearly in breach of shopping policy,
and would take between 10% and 15% of business from existing centres.
There was particular concern that the plan could jeopardise the
development of the Buchanan Centre in Glasgow's city centre, adjacent to
the new Concert Hall.
It was further felt by officials that the development would prejudice
the development of a medium-sized industrial site.
Councillors, however, were deeply divided, with some local members,
like Mr Robert McGerty and Mrs Deirdre Gaughan, arguing that their
deprived communities were anxious to take advantage of the leisure
facilities on offer.

DORNOCH Academy, the first school in Scotland to be granted
self-governing status, was given the go-ahead by the Scottish Office
yesterday to become a six-year secondary.
Government approval marks the culmination of a campaign by parents who
argued that the school, which had been downgraded to a first and second-
year establishment, should provide education for 11 to 17-year-olds.
The announcement, made by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, was welcomed by
the school's board of management spokesperson, Mrs Jenifer Cameron.
Dornoch Academy has 56 pupils in its first and second years at present
but Mrs Cameron said she was confident the roll would rise to more than
250 after upgrading work had been completed in two or three years.
The academy had originally been a six-year secondary but parents voted
for self-governing status in protest at Highland region's plans for the
school.
Mr Lang's announcement was criticised by Highland region's education
committee convener Val MacIver and the Sutherland Parents Action Group.
Mrs MacIver said the school was taking disproportionate sums of money
from the central government education budget, which meant that other
schools in the area were suffering for political reasons.
The action group said it was a sad day for education in the Highlands.
It said severe budget cuts would cause the region to close or merge
secondary schools, yet Mr Lang was ''dealing a second blow'' by allowing
Dornoch to begin upgrading.
''This can only be a political decision by Mr Lang to bolster the
Government's opt-out policy,'' the group said and it called on the
Government to justify the decision.
Parents will have to be balloted on the upgrading proposal but Mrs
Cameron said she expected them to support the move.
''The announcement is the best news we could have had. Parents have
been pressing for upgrading for a long time,'' she said.
The opt-out ballot and upgrading campaign have caused deep divisions
in the local community but Mr Lang said the board of management had had
enough time to gain the experience of running a self-governing school.
Having made the most of the opportunities coming from opting out, Mr
Lang said it would have been unreasonable to have turned down the
upgrading request.
The self-governing schools legislation prevented Dornoch Academy from
automatically becoming a six-year secondary.
In the first five years after opting out, a school requires the
consent of the Secretary of State to change character and it must be
endorsed by parents in a further ballot.
Meanwhile, a robust defence of the Government scheme which subsidises
independent schools by more than #10m a year was mounted yesterday by
Scottish Education Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
He said the assisted places scheme had helped more than 3000 pupils
whose parents would otherwise have been unable to afford the cost of
private secondary schooling, where day fees amount to about #3500 a
year.
The number of pupils benefiting from the scheme increased by 60% in
the 10 years to 1993-4, he said.
The Minister's remarks will take on added significance after last
week's controversy about the leading Edinburgh independent school,
George Watson's College, approaching three Lothian region secondaries
about forming closer sporting and curricular links.
The private school said it did not want to run the risk of becoming
more elitist under a Labour Government but critics said it was looking
to expand its recruitment base in light of Labour's commitment to
abolish the scheme, which gives less well-off families income-related
assistance with their children's school fees.
Ayrshire Labour MP Brian Donohoe, who has carried out research on the
scheme, said last night that Lord James' remarks confirmed that the
Government still had its head in the sand, even after the Tories'
humiliating performance in last week's council elections.
He said that, as far as he knew, his party remained committed to
abolishing the scheme.

THE first meeting of Argyll and Bute Council took place yesterday --
making local government history by being the first of the new councils
to convene.
It was convened by Mr Michael Gossip, chief executive of Argyll and
Bute District Council who chaired the meeting until Mr John Wilson was
elected first convener.
Mr Wilson, 64, a retired restaurateur from Lochdon, Mull, said: ''This
is a historic day and many of you will be looking forward to expressing
hard work, loyalty, and unending patience.
''I hope this council will go from strength to strength. There is
going to be a lot of hard work before we launch into the council
proper.''
Mr Wilson's vice-convener is Mr Donald McKerrell, 78, who ran a dairy
on Islay before retiring.
The council, which takes over from Argyll and Bute District Council in
12 months' time, will meet again on May 10.
The 21-strong Independent block on the 33-member council voted in
their own candidates to the top posts.
However, the new set-up left rival political parties unhappy.
Liberal Democrat leader Councillor Alison Hay said after the meeting
that it was ''illogical'' for Independents to band together as a single
grouping.
She also said that no-one knew what policies the Independent block was
going to follow.

SUPERMARKET chain Tesco yesterday announced plans to open two Scottish
stores next year, in Falkirk and Dunblane.
The announcement comes as the company revealed an operating profit of
#550m, up almost 23%. Wm Low contributed #11m since its September
acquisition, up by almost 16%.
Mr Dennis Goldie, leader of Falkirk District Council, said: ''I am
delighted. This means 300 new jobs in Falkirk.''
Construction of the building in Grahams Road, originally planned by Wm
Low, was halfcompleted last year.
Stirling Provost Pat Greenhill also welcomed the move. The Dunblane
store will create 150 jobs.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, said: ''When we took over Wm Low
in September 1994, existing stores were experiencing a sales decline of
6% on the previous year. We have significantly improved performance.''
All 57 Wm Low stores in Scotland remain open since the takeover. The
job gains must, however, be offset against losses at the head office in
Dundee, where only 50 of the former 300 Wm Low staff remain. They will
lose their jobs in July.

<HEADLINE>Trust backs down over plan to tag waste bags</HEADLINE>

OFFICIALS at one of Glasgow's largest hospital trusts have backed down
from proposals to make hospital staff sign all bags containing waste.
The West Glasgow Hospitals University NHS Trust, responsible for the
Western Infirmary and Gartnavel General, is one of two trusts in the
city which faces prosecution for allegedly mixing clinical waste in with
domestic hospital refuse.
In a two-pronged attempt to tighten procedures, staff had been told
they would have to sign tags on waste bags and also had been sent a
letter warning of disciplinary and possibly legal action if clinical and
domestic waste were put in the wrong bags.
Following complaints that no-one could guarantee what was going in the
bags, the trust has now abandoned the signature plans.
Ms Isobel Gowan, director of patient services and contracts at the
trust, said the hospital had reacted to staff concerns.
''When we got the labels made up in the first place, they did ask for
a signature. There has been some concern that people couldn't guarantee
what was going in the bags. It will not be necessary to sign them.
Nobody actually refused to do so; there has just been a concern
raised,'' she said.
Ms Gowan said the hospital was trying to ensure that the correct
procedures in dealing with waste were followed.
''The letter reminds everybody of their responsibility and that
procedure should be adhered to. It reminds people that, under the
Environmental Protection Act, individuals could be liable. That is not a
matter for the hospitals but for the procurator-fiscal's office.''
Mr Dave Watson, regional organiser for Unison, the largest health
service union, said the proposals to make people sign bags had been
flawed.
He said: ''Clearly everyone needs to be careful what goes in these
bags but if you can't keep your eye on the bags for hours on end, you
can't be made responsible for what goes in them.''
Ms Anne Thomson, Glasgow officer of the Royal College of Nursing, said
the responsibility for waste management lay with the hospitals, adding:
''They have to be responsible in that they must provide clear training
and guidelines for all members of staff.''

NEW safety standards for roll-on/roll-off ferries recommended
yesterday by a panel of experts may not be sufficient to avert another
Estonia or Herald of Free Enterprise-style disaster, a Glasgow
University marine expert claimed last night.
Mr Ian Winkle, senior lecturer in the naval architecture and ocean
engineering department, said the use of transverse bulkheads creating
watertight compartments on ferry car decks, as suggested by the
London-based International Maritime Organisation, would not necessarily
prevent a repetition of ferry disasters.
''Transverse bulkheads can successfully deal with water coursing onto
the car deck from the middle, such as would happen when a ferry is
struck by another vessel,'' Mr Winkle said. ''But they cannot help when
water enters the car deck from either bow or stern, such as happened
with the Estonia and the Zeebrugge disaster.''
More than 900 people were killed last September when the Estonia sank
in the Baltic sea; 190 lives were lost in 1987 when the Herald of Free
Enterprise capsized when sailing from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.
The IMO panel of experts produced its recommendations in a draft
amendment to the Safety Of Lives At Sea (Solas) convention which governs
all international shipping.
While the IMO secretary general, Mr William O'Neil, said they
considered ro-ro ferries to be conceptually safe, the report suggests
the car deck be divided into watertight compartments by the use of the
transverse bulkheads with other barriers at right angles.
This, the report claimed, would prevent the general flooding of the
whole area, which caused the rapid capsize of several ferries in the
past when water moved suddenly to one side.
Mr O'Neil admitted, however, that it was impossible to say this system
would eradicate the risk of another capsize but would merely minimise
that possibility.
Mr Winkle claimed that the loading requirements of such ferries, with
the need for rapid access by several hundred cars and lorries, would
mean that if fitted, the bulkheads (described as ''big doors'') would
rarely be closed, leaving the deck open to an influx of water in the
event of a stern or bow collision, or door failure.
In addition to the bulkhead recommendation, the IMO panel suggested
the ferries carry airliner-style black box voyage data recorders and
urged ferry companies to improve their evacuation procedures.
Improved training for seamen and the adoption of one working language
for multinational crews was also recommended.
If adopted by the IMO's marine safety committee, the panel's proposals
could be in force by the end of next year.
While it is anticipated that several British companies will require to
invest substantial funds to meet the revised safety standards, one of
Scotland's biggest ferry companies, Caledonian MacBrayne, said last
night it was well on the way to completing its own safety improvements
using a different system.
Mr Ted Sangster, Cal-Mac's operations director, said only three of the
company's fleet of 30had enclosed car decks and as such were affected by
the proposals.
Cal-Mac use devices known as ''sponsons'' (enclosed compartments
running alongside the hull of the ship) in two of these three ships.
Mr Winkle and a team of marine engineers at Glasgow University have
produced an innovative ''perforated deck'' design which allows water to
run directly to the lowest part of the hull and, they claim, prevents
the vessel capsizing.

A COMMITTEE representing rank and file Conservatives yesterday threw
its weight behind Scottish party leaders -- despite speculation that
some might be cast as scapegoats for last week's disastrous local
election results.
The general purposes committee of the Scottish Conservative and
Unionist Association met behind closed doors in Glasgow. But its
president, Mr David McLetchie, gave an impromptu news conference at the
Scottish Royal Automobile Club.
He admitted that the Conservative local election vote -- calculated at
11.3% with the party not able to control any of the new single-tier
authorities -- was ''disastrously low''.
He blamed disunity, membership problems, and conflicts between local
and national taxation policies for the crushing defeat.
Mr McLetchie said the committe meeting had been organised well in
advance of the local elections last week and was ''in no way a crisis
meeting or crisis session''.
He said: ''The appearance of disunity and division within the party is
one of the major factors which was identified again and again by those
who contributed to the discussion.''
Mr McLetchie said the constituency leaders at the meeting also
criticised increases in direct and indirect taxation, such as VAT, by
the national party when Conservative authorities were attempting to
reduce council tax.
He felt it was crucial to re-establish the party's reputation for low
taxation.
But he denied that there was any specific Scottish issue which could
account for the poor election results. He promised to maintain the fight
to preserve the Union.
He added: ''The national committee fully endorses the chairmanship of
Sir Michael Hirst as chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party. It is
idle speculation that his position was in doubt.''
The position of Scottish Secretary Ian Lang had also not been called
into question, though Mr McLetchie hinted that there may be changes in
the future.
He said: ''We have every confidence in the Secretary of State and if
there are any adjustments to be made in a Cabinet reshuffle that would
be a matter for the Prime Minister.''
He played down reports that Conservative MP Michael Forsyth could be a
possible future candidate for the position of Scottish Secretary.

THE Government's campaign against the media was thrown into confusion
yesterday by National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell, who distanced
himself from demands for strict privacy legislation.
His admission that he is reluctant to impose statutory controls on the
press appeared to contradict the call for a crusade against
sleaze-raking journalism issued 24 hours earlier by Treasury Chief
Secretary Jonathan Aitken, with the support of the Prime Minister.
Mr Dorrell said: ''I am unwilling to resort to law if we can develop a
system of self-regulation, which is inherently preferable if it can be
made to work.''
Yesterday, Mr Aitken, who on Monday attacked the ''cancer of bent and
corrupt journalism'', failed to carry out his threat of ''immediate
action'' against Granada TV's World in Action programme, which examined
his relations with the Saudi royal family.
He said he was putting off a decision on whether to proceed with a
defamation suit until after Easter. Meanwhile, he was examining a
transcript of Monday's programme with his legal advisers, as well as
allegations carried in other newspapers on his links with Iran.
On Monday, Mr Aitken attacked what he called ''outrageous falsehoods''
published in that day's Guardian and said he had launched an action for
defamation against the paper.

A POLITICAL rift which led to a constituency Conservative association
being disbanded in 1991 has re-emerged with top Scottish Tories
implicated in a new row.
Scottish Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst and Lord MacKay of
Ardbrecknish have been drawn into the controversy after the chairman of
Argyll and Bute Conservative Association gave her backing to an
Independent councillor, Mr Scott MacClure, for a recent parliamentary
selection procedure.
The chairman of the Dunoon branch resigned in ''disgust'' while her
vice-chairman left stating that she held no confidence in Mrs Betty
Waddell, who was behind the move to back Mr MacClure against established
Conservative Party contenders.
The revelations, which have just been made by former senior party
office holders, are the latest stage in a row which has simmered amongst
Tories on the west coast for almost four years.
In December 1991, Conservative Central Office, in an unprecedented
move, disbanded the Argyll and Bute Conservative Association after a
four-month row over the parliamentary candidacy of Mr Bill Hodgson
threatened Tory chances in the 1992 General Election.
Mrs Rachel Sant resigned as Dunoon branch chairman in October last
year at the promotion of Independent district councillor and local
publican Mr MacClure as a prospective conservative parliamentary
candidate.
''Two years ago we knew nothing of Mr MacClure being a Conservative --
in fact in 1992 he stood for the council as an Independent,'' said Mrs
Sant.
''Then he promised that he would stand for local council elections as
an official Conservative . . . but last week he again stood as an
Independent.
''After I discovered that he was claiming the support of Micky Hirst
and Lord Mackay, I telephoned Micky to say I was unhappy with it and I
resigned.''
Mr MacClure failed to gain the parliamentary nomination against Mr
Ralph Leishman after being included on a short leet of six.
Last night, Mr MacClure said: ''I certainly had the support of Sir
Michael Hirst and Lord MacKay didn't object to his name being used to
support me.''.

A RUGBY tournament in Romania -- dubbed the Junior World Cup --
erupted in violence during Scotland's opening match yesterday.
From the outset, the Scots were faced with rough play from their
Russian opponents. One player was sent off and another reported for
running from the bench and kicking the Scottish hooker as he lay on the
ground.
A letter condemning the behaviour of the young Russian team is on its
way to the organisers, FIRA, from Scotland under-19 team manager David
Sole.
He said last night: ''Our boys behaved superbly in the face of
appalling provocation and we shall be stating our case to FIRA very
strongly indeed.''
A disciplinary meeting was hurriedly convened at which the Russians
will be asked to explain their behaviour, described by one observer as
''bar- room brawling''.
South African referee Willem Henning, a police officer in Pretoria,
described the conduct of the Russians as the worst he had ever seen.
The Russians are expected to face severe punishment and possible
exclusion from the tournament.
Despite the disruption, the young Scots won 35-0.

Rail passengers scored a first
victory against the Government's privatisation programme yesterday
when the Rail Regulator announced there will be no reduction in the
number of stations selling through-tickets.
Mr John Swift, QC, who suggested in January that under privatisation
the number of stations selling tickets across the network could be
reduced from 1300 to less than 300, admitted yesterday that the outcry
from passengers had forced him to change his mind.
Instead, he has ruled that the current system will continue when
private operators take over passenger services, with a review after two
years. ''The overwhelming response to my consultation document is that
passengers want the security of what they have at present,'' he said.
The potentially devastating impact of the loss of ticketing services
in rural areas galvanised opposition in Scotland. Mr Lawrence Kemp --
acting chairman of the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland
-- welcomed yesterday's decision but said it was a pity that no
consultation was offered on the Motorail and sleeper services which
cease operations in May.
Mr Kemp said: ''We are very pleased with this clear demonstration that
the Regulator means what he says when he stresses the importance of
consultation and that he will take heed of the views expressed by rail
users.
''From a Scottish viewpoint, we are particularly pleased that the same
level of access and service will remain in the Highlands and other areas
away from the central belt.''
Opposition MPs and rail campaigners described the decision variously
as a U-turn and a climbdown yesterday. However, Mr Swift's reversal is
also a success for the Government's much-vaunted consultation process,
which Ministers claim gives passengers a greater say over the railways.
The Regulator, who acts as the Government's privatisation referee,
admitted the deluge of protests had had its effect: ''We listened, as I
said we would. I am here to protect the interests of the passenger.
''The passengers have been articulate and persuasive. This was the
first time they had a chance of speaking out on one of the issues that
affected them in the future of railways.''
Mr Swift's consultation document, in which the proposal to limit
through-ticketing to just 294 stations was one of three options, caused
an uproar when it was published. The strength of the protest forced
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney to distance himself from the plan.

LEGAL actions to restore the axed Anglo-Scottish sleeper and Motorail
services are imminent.
Challenges are expected from a variety of sources after yesterday's
intervention by Rail Regulator John Swift -- plus The Herald's recent
revelation that ScotRail planned to thwart rescue bids for the sleepers
by running ''ghost trains''.
Pressure on British Rail to rethink the May 28 service withdrawals
increased when Mr Swift insisted that they should not occur until a
consultation process was concluded.
He had been asked to intervene on behalf of passengers, councils, MPs,
and rail pressure groups. They were joined in welcoming his views by
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney. Dr Mawhinney said that the
intervention was ''a further demonstration that privatisation moves
forward with the passenger firmly in mind''.
In a letter to the Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee, Mr
Swift said he had no statutory powers to require British Rail to
maintain the Fort William-Euston and Edinburgh-Plymouth sleepers, or
Motorail.
But he added that assurances had been received from franchise director
Roger Salmon that the rolling stock would be retained until after
consultations on ScotRail's passenger service requirements were
concluded.
Mr Swift also said the House of Commons had been assured that
''assets'' would not be disposed of before the end of the consultation
period.
He went on: ''It would, in my view, be a frustration of that process
of consultation were BR to take any commercial decision that made it
impracticable to restore the services.''
Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty, and
Skye, immediately perceived ''an overwhelming moral and practical
obligation'' on BR to maintain the services throughout the summer
consultation period.
He said: ''If they refuse to bow to professional, public, and
political opinion on this, then they should be challenged legally by a
competent regional council in its capacity as a relevant transport
authority.''
He claimed that ScotRail had already discussed redundancy or
redeployment arrangements with Fort William-based sleeper staff and
Motorail staff.
It was confirmed later that Highland Regional Council, among others,
was seeking legal opinion.
One legal challenge to withdrawal of the Fort William-Euston sleeper
can be expected within a few weeks, according to Mr Christopher
Monckton, a former adviser to Baroness Thatcher.
He said moves were well under way. They followed The Herald's report
that ScotRail planned to run a ''ghost train special'' aimed at avoiding
legal action to save the West Highland sleeper.
It is alleged that ScotRail will run an 11pm Maryhill-Bishopbriggs
service on the Cowlairs chord, currently used only by the Fort William
service. By keeping the line open, it would escape a lengthy and tough
consultation process.
Such a tactic has been described by Conservative MP Bill Walker (North
Tayside) as cheating of the worst kind, and he supports calls for a
judicial review.
Mr Monckton, the former London journalist who once labelled the Scots
subsidy junkies but now lives in Perthshire, said he expected supporters
of the West Highland Line to go to the Court of Session soon.
They will seek an interim interdict to ensure that services are
retained during the consultation process and pending a full judicial
review of the case.
Mr Monckton, a business consultant, is son and heir of Viscount
Monckton of Brenchley, and lives at Finnart Lodge, Bridge of Gaur. He is
a regular user of the Fort William sleeper.
Legal actions, subject to raising #5000, would show an economic case
for the service to be retained, he said. British Rail says running costs
are too high.
The Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee, responding to Mr
Swift's remarks, said: ''BR appears to already be redeploying sleeper
and Motorail staff and has also initiated proposals to close the Wembley
maintenance deport in north- west London which services the Motorail
vehicles.
''The committee believes that BR cannot now proceed with the
implementation of these decisions without challenging the Regulator's
clearly expressed views.'
The Rail Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland said it was
pleased that the franchising director had recognised, albeit belatedly,
the need for full consultations on the Anglo-Scottish sleepers and
Motorail. ''We believe they should continue to operate normally
throughout the consultation process,'' an official said.
A spokesman for ScotRail last night merely ''noted'' the Rail
Regulator's declaration, but confirmed that ''discussions are taking
place at the highest level''. He added: ''Nothing has changed.''

THERE was outrage last night over the Rolls-Royce board taking salary
increases of 27% overall when staff at East Kilbride are fighting to
save their jobs.
As the workers prepared for strikes in a last-ditch bid to prevent
closure, accounts published yesterday also show increases in performance
related bonuses from #58,000 to #324,000 among the 13-strong board.
East Kilbride MP Adam Ingram said the insensitivity of Rolls-Royce
management never ceased to amaze. ''They are acting in a very selfish
way.''
Senior works' convener Graham Irvine described the salary rises as
outrageous. ''The board has produced nothing -- other than misery for
Scotland.''
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the
awards added insult to injury to the 600 staff at the East Kilbride
aero-design and research centre, facing redundancy later this year.
When the company in January announced the closure, and transfer of
work to Derby and Bristol, staff were told they did a better job, more
efficiently and cheaper than their English colleagues. They were also
told that record profits had been made in recent years at East Kilbride.
Highly-skilled, their salaries range from #17,000 to more than
#40,000.
The company's 1994 accounts reveal chairman Sir Ralph Robins received
an 18% boost in salary last year. The rise, from #334,000 in 1993 --
when he waived a #7000 performance related bonus -- now puts him on
#406,000. It includes a performance related bonus of #60,000.
The board as a whole received a 27% increase, with the salary bill
rising from #1.845m to #2.343m.
The East Kilbride workforce, unaware of the salary disclosures,
yesterday drew up a battle plan that far exceeded expectations.
It was forecast they would turn the screw slowly on management and
approve a rolling programme of industrial action, with all-out strikes
only as a last resort.
However, the mass meeting unanimously agreed a one-and-a-half-day
stoppage from next Wednesday followed a week later by a two-day strike.
An indefinite overtime ban will also be imposed from Tuesday. Union
officials thought that tactic would be enough to damage severely the
company's tight schedules to meet contracts at home and abroad.
Many of the staff have been working overtime, including Sundays, to
meet the healthy, and profitable, order book.
Last month, Rolls-Royce announced 1994 profits had risen by 33% to
#101m before tax, boosted by plant closures and a fall in research and
development spending.
During the year, the company's job-cutting cost #95m in restructuring
charges. The workforce fell to 41,000, down 10% over the year and more
than 20% down since the restructuring programme was announced in 1993.
Management has now formally received seven days' notice of the initial
industrial actions, but it is understood the meeting also agreed an
escalating programme which spans at least three weeks.
Mr Irvine said the meeting had been unaware of the board's salary
increases, and added: ''But, even then, it could not have improved the
unanimous result.''
He said: ''These rises are ludicrous. The staff producing profit are
suffering a loss of jobs, of earnings. The board has produced nothing
other than misery for Scotland.''
Mr Ingram claimed the board was ''acting in a selfish way'' at a time
shen British industry, and the aerospace sector, was fighting for
survival. He added: ''For management to take these increases is, quite
simply, ridiculous. The insensitivity of Rolls-Royce management never
ceases to amaze me.''
Mr Wilson asked: ''Why should directors be awarded for contractions?
These increases are a clear signal that there is no such thing as
voluntary restraint in British boardrooms when it comes to directors'
pay.''
The East Kilbride closure is part of a drive to cut costs and improve
business performance and efficiency.
The company declined to comment on implications of the vote for
industrial action. A spokesman said it was inappropriate to comment
because it was probable management and national union officials would
meet today.
According to shop stewards, industrial action will immediately hit the
company's multi-million pound joint aero-engines project with BMW, which
is nearing deadlines, and the services and supplies for engines used by
commercial aircraft.
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions' committee, said:
''We want only to save the plant. We have done what is necessary for the
company to come and talk to us.''
* Rolls-Royce has reduced its contribution to the Tory Party to
#35,000, down from #60,000 for 1993, the report and accounts show. The
cut follows a heated debate at the last AGM when some shareholders
raised objections to the payment.
A resolution will go to shareholders at the AGM next month giving
directors authority, for three years, to make political donations.
Dissenters could block such donations.

CORNISH fishermen were yesterday given a top-level quayside thank you
for supporting Canada in its fisheries dispute with Spain.
Canadian High Commissioner Royce Frith travelled to Newlyn to see the
skippers who have been flying Canada's Maple Leaf flag from their boats
to show support for colleagues thousands of miles away.
Mr Frith toured the quay, met the fishermen, and handed over Canadian
flags, bought and signed by Canadian MPs, for which there has been a
huge local demand.
Following Euro agreements which allow the Spanish in their home
waters, the Cornishmen are taking part in a national campaign to bring
the UK out of what they consider the ''unfair'' Common Fisheries Policy.
There were other problems for the Spanish yesterday. The Irish Navy
detained a Spanish trawler for alleged illegal fishing off County Kerry
as two skippers were expected to appear in court today after being
arrested by patrol vessels off County Mayo.
A Spanish trawler crew and captain were also detained in Cape Town by
South African marine conservation officials after a tip-off they were
using an illegal ''wall of death'' gill net. An inspector said it was 13
miles long.
''The ship appears to be South African-owned but the 18 crew members
are Spanish,'' the inspector said.
In France, striking fishermen attacked Spanish lorries and dumped
their food cargoes in the streets of Boulogne.
