A DRASTIC pruning of the bureaucratic jungle which faces farmers as
they try to manage the various EU support schemes is called for by the
Scottish Liberal Democrats in their consultation document, Farming and
the Scottish Rural Community.
''Farmers today have to juggle with a myriad of Euro schemes in order
to make ends meet -- it's mind-bending, bureaucratic, a waste of time,
and it's completely unnecessary,'' say the Liberal Democrats.
Instead, they propose one simple system. It would be based, they say,
on countryside management contracts, available to all farmers and land
managers. Each would be able to choose from a wide-ranging ''menu'' of
options, varying regionally.
Each item on the menu would be worth a certain number of points, with
each point carrying a money value related to the overall fund available.
Each farmer could claim payments up to a maximum per holding.
''Experience gained from the operation of the Environmentally
Sensitive Area scheme in the UK, and similar schemes elsewhere in the
EU, prove that this system would be both popular and effective,'' says
the consultation paper. ''It would remove incentives for
over-production, could be cheaply and efficiently administered, and
would allow farmers to use their land to the best advantage.''
It is envisaged that a few special cases of direct payment would
continue for the foreseeable future. This applies particularly to the
ewe and suckler cow premium schemes, and the Less Favoured Area
supplementary system -- on which the survival of hill and upland farming
depends.
Mrs Ray Michie, MP for Argyll and Bute -- the party's spokeswoman on
rural affairs -- accepted that any comprehensive plan for reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy would take years to implement. Meantime, she
called for a restoration of Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances to
the levels of two years ago, and the index-linking of other main grants
to hill farmers, such as Suckler Cow Premium and Sheep Annual Premium.
Quotas in general were in a mess, and inept administration by
Whitehall was making the situation a great deal worse than it need be,
she indicated. The consultation document singles out Sheep Annual
Premium as being managed in a particularly unjust way.
On milk quota, the UK as a whole is described as grossly
under-supplied, while other EU members are sitting on a surplus -- ''an
injustice only made possible by the Government's continuing acquiescence
in the secret deals of the Council of Ministers.''
The mismanagement of all forms of quota is depicted, not as an EU
problem, but as ''home-grown in London.''
The Liberal-Democrat solutions are: Allow for greater flexibility in
the allocation and administration of quota; push for additional quota
allocation for the UK; make milk quota tradeable across EU borders; and
curb speculation in quota by forcing non-producing holders to sell it
within a specified time limit, except in areas where quota is now
ringfenced.
On lowland farms, the consultation document advocates the eventual
abolition of set-aside, claiming that ''no amount of tinkering will ever
make an inherently unworkable policy useful.'' It also calls for the
provision of land for smaller holdings; the promotion of machinery rings
and co-operative marketing ventures; and encouragement for retailers to
stock local produce.
Close monitoring of land use and sale, with local authorities given
powers of pre-emptive purchase to prevent damaging changes of ownership
in exceptional cases, is also proposed. Crofting is commended as the
kind of low-input, low output farming which should be encouraged, not
merely to survive, but to expand and prosper. De-crofting of land should
at all times be discouraged.
In a section on diversification, the paper points out that often the
best land for windfarms will be found in the remoter upland areas. ''For
once, therefore, it may be the hill farmers who stand to benefit.
Renewable energy may give them a rare and ideal opportunity to diversify
and increase the value of their land at the same time. The
Liberal-Democrats propose a mandatory code of practice for windfarm
development, including requirements for full consultation with local
communities, and continuous monitoring of performance.
The paper concludes that it is easy to be pessimistic about the future
of the countryside. ''The rural population continues to decline, turning
many old communities into ghettoes for the elderly and unemployed. Many
farmers teeter on the brink of bankruptcy. Others are driven to despair
by senseless bureaucracy. Nobody in power seems to care who owns the
land, or what they do with it.''

IN this, the first column of 1995, Finger on The Pulse looks to the
future. We want to know what's in store for West of Scotland business
this year. Will 1995 bring prosperity or poverty, delight or depression?
A recent report published by The Economist claims to have the answers.
Scotland has every reason to celebrate 1995, it predicts. It even
suggests that the celebrations might carry on well into 1996 -- Soaraway
Scotland, in fact!
In a list of economic predictions for the coming year, the report
anticipates that the Scottish economy will grow faster than it has done
in the past two years. But that's not all. It also predicts that
Scotland will outperform the rest of the UK, unemployment will fall, and
exports will accelerate.
The good news for Scotland is in stark contrast to the report's
overall forecast for Britain. It gloomily warns that the best is over
for Britain -- that this year will see the economy decelerate, living
standards slip, and falls in unemployment reduced to a trickle.
The only New Year cheer that the report offers to Britain is that
there will be no return to recession. However, this is cold comfort when
it also predicts that Britain will lose its place as the strongest
economy in Europe and will find itself sliding to the bottom of the
international pile.
However, the message for Scotland is optimistically upbeat and as we
now move into 1995 business confidence seems to be returning, order
books have picked up, the electronic sector continues to perform well,
and the oil industry seems to be back on track.
But a year is a long time in business and as we move in to 1995 what
are the main economic indicators?
FTSE-100Up 0.5 points to 3054.9
Retail Price IndexUp x% to 145.3
Headline inflation2.9% (up 0.5%)
Underlying inflation2.5% (up 0.2%)
Seasonal food pricesUp 0.1%
Scotland's unemploymentDown x%
Growth in average earningsSteady at x%
Manufacturing productivityUp x%
Factory gate pricesUp x%.
What exactly does all this mean? Are The Economist's predictions
correct? Is Scotland set to soar this year? We had a word with some
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce members -- the voice of West of Scotland
Business today. Is ''Soar-away Scotland'' a myth or a reality?
Marilyn Orcharton, Managing Director at Kite Consultants Ltd,
certainly sees Scotland soaring this year and believes women will play a
large part in the success.
''I think 1995 will be a very successful year for Scottish
businesswomen, marked with the launch of the World Association of Women
Entrepreneurs taking place here in Scotland,'' she says.
''And on a more general scale, I think 1995 will be an excellent year
for Scotland. Many inward investors are already making plans to increase
their workforces, and there is a definite buzz of excitement among
chamber members when they talk of opportunities for this year.
''The current media attention that Scotland us getting over the
devolution question is also raising awareness of Scotland's business
capacity.''
Meanwhile David Semple, Chairman of Semple Fraser WS, the business law
partnership, sees 1995 as the year of the entrepreneur but offers a word
of warning:
''We are now seeing an increase in activity by entrepreneurs in
Scotland who have been looking at deals for some time and have come to
the conclusion that there will not be a better time to do them,'' he
says.
''This promises to be a good year for setting up, developing, and
buying and selling businesses. It's just a shame that the ethic here in
Scotland is so anti-entrepreneurial. This will certainly hold us back
compared to our economically successful competitors -- including
England.''
Frank Blin, Managing Partner at Coopers and Lybrand, is quietly
confident about the coming year. Indeed, he reveals that the company's
merger and acquisition broking service is currently witnessing an
increased level of activity.
''I think that this year will bring a change of emphasis on the type
of deals we complete, moving away from the restructuring of businesses
in difficulty or the creation of phoenix-from-the-ashes rescues,'' he
says.
''There are now a number of institutionally-backed businesses who have
come through a difficult recessionary trading period well. In my view
these businesses will now become more active, be it in initiating
mergers, acquisitions or joint ventures, and we are optimistically
looking forward to growth and activity.''
A more cautious note comes from Duncan Tannahill, General Manager at
Lex Vauxhall.
''The motor industry, which represents the UK's biggest manufacturing
industry, has started 1995 on a disappointing note with a 16% decrease
in its market registrations of new cars compared to the start of January
last year,'' he says.
''Until uncertainty decreases and confidence at home returns, then
volumes and margins are likely to remain under extreme pressure in 1995.
However, in saying all of this, there are positive signs of renewing
consumer interest in vehicle products which promises much for 1995. I
just hope that the optimism delivers.''
Meanwhile, Sue Bartley at Casual Cuisine Catering has her own views.
''As a small family business we have probably felt the pinch less than
most,'' she says. ''We are able to cut overheads and adapt reasonably
easily to changing market demands.
''I am sure 1995 will see a significant increase in business activity,
but any 'soaring' could still be mixed with a fair bit of 'hovering'.
However, I'm confident that by the end of 1995 Scottish businesses will
be doing a little more celebrating than last year.''
We asked Glasgow Chamber's Chief Executive, Geoff Runcie, to put all
of this into perspective. ''The recent Scottish Chambers and Fraser of
Allander Survey highlighted Scotland's improving performance and
optimism for the coming year,'' he points out.
''This was particularly gratifying in relation to a lack of optimism
in other parts of the UK. The members of the Chamber who have
contributed to our column are all striking an optimistic note, and
despite a cautionary comment in one or two places, I do believe that
1995 is a year when we must take grasp of the opportunities at every
corner.
''It is easy to get hung up on analysis of trends but we must remember
that the recent recession was unique in many respects, not only because
of its depth but because of the length of time during which businesses
were affected. We don't have a model on which to base our projections in
recent history, so optimism is surely a very powerful tool in causing
things to happen rather than waiting for them to happen.
''Being cautious is fine and prudent: quality decisions about business
investment and development have always been the hallmark of Scottish
business and I don't see why that should change now.
''But seeking out the real opportunities is equally part of something
that the Scots are well known for: so let's go for it in 1995!

Car repairs and servicing on your doorstep: that is the concept which
is proving a winner for a young entrepreneur who, as Janet Reid
discovers, is just moving into top gear when it comes to good ideas
YOUNG entrepreneur David McLaughlin doen't need publicity, thank you
very much. What he would really like, if he could wave a magic spanner,
is 48 hours in every day. Already, after only eight months in business,
he is having to burn the midnight oil far too often in order to satisfy
his customers' demands.
McLaughlin is a mechanic and founder-owner of Motor Mend, a garage on
wheels. Self-styled Knight of the Road, his expertise is such that
motorists in the Greater Glasgow area are clamouring for his services,
most of them alerted to his skills by recommendations from their
friends.
McLaughlin set up Motor Mend last May with advice from Drumchapel
Business Centre and financial help from the local Enterprise Action Fund
and the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust. He was the first
recipient of a grant from the Trust to come from Drumchapel.
His involvement with cars goes back as far as he can remember. As a
kid he would go round scrapyards with his father, who was a motor
mechanic; and his uncles' boots were as familiar to him as their faces,
for he spent hours watching them too, stretched out beneath ailing
motors.
AS soon as he left school he tried to get an apprenticeship. One year
under the auspices of the YTS scheme and three years of traditional
apprenticeship later and he was a fully qualified motor mechanic with a
string of qualifications to his name.
These included certificates from the City and Guilds and the Road
Transport Industrial Training Board, and increasingly, as he moved from
the Ford garage where he trained to another specialist garage (this time
one which concentrated on restoring old Spitfires and MGBs) he felt he
could provide a better service on his own.
Too many garages, he says, either rely on semi-skilled labour and
provide a second-rate srvice, or else making profits at the expense of
their skilled workforce who are not given enough time to do a
conscientious job.
He decided to pioneer a new approach. This would
provide customers with a service which was thorough, expert, and of a
high quality. But instead of opening a static garage workshop, he hit on
the novel idea of setting up a mobile garage on wheels.
This garage, he is at pains to emphasise, could not be further removed
from the cowboy mechanics whose jolting, dented van filled with dirty
tools and oily rags lives up to every dismal expectation and only
reflects the shoddy efforts of its owner. McLaughlin's Transit van
(bought second-hand from ScottishPower) is immaculate inside and out --
its shiny cleanliness intended to convey the superiority of his motor
repair and service provision.
He is so busy that he plans to take on his own apprentice shortly. In
the longer term, he plans to get a couple of breakdown wagons and
another three or four vans so that he can offer the same comprehensive
repair and servicing as ordinary garages, but with the bonuses to the
customer of convenience and competitive prices.
Even now, he is able to offer a wide range of services to customers
from as far as Milngavie and Blanefield in the north to Giffnock and
Johnstone in the south. He is qualified and capable of dealing with
mechanical, electrical, coachbuilding and security problems; he can
service any make of car; and because it's in his own interest to get
jobs finished quickly, if he has to get parts he'll drive off and get
them. Not that this is usually necessary -- he carries a selection of
fan belts, sparking plugs and so on.
And while he rapidly pays off his insurance (at #2000, twice what he
paid for his van, and his largest outlay), he leaves no stone unturned
in his pursuit of business growth.
Having completed various training courses in marketing and
book-keeping, he keeps abreast of modern motor technology by going on
more advanced mechanical, electronic and welding courses; and last month
he started an evening class in computers.
Once he has mastered spread sheets and data bases, his intention is to
computerise: to be as professional as his dentist who sends out cards to
advise customers of their annual check-ups.
Some might say that Motor Mend is already upstaging his dentist.
Though the teeth McLaughlin deals with are the serrated ones on cogs
beneath the bonnet, he wears surgical gloves to maintain scrupulous
cleanliness. And he changes his overalls at least once every day.

THE HISTORY OF healthcare management in the NHS is to a large extent a
history of attempts to solve two key management problems -- how to
allocate scarce resources, and how to manage those resources in order to
deliver a service that combines efficiency with appropriate social
objectives.
Throughout the history of the NHS reforms, four different methods of
achieving these efficiencies competed for primacy -- planning, politics,
managerialism, and the market.
The planning approach was very much in tune with the times in the late
1940s and during the 1950s. It went alongside the nationalisation of key
industries such as coal and steel, which were run on centrally-planned
lines in the monolithic highly-centralised bureaucratic forms of
organisation, but where the nationalised industries had blue-collar
workforces, the NHS had doctors and nurses.
Doctors and nurses would not, could not, and probably should not be
incorporated into a monolithic management bureaucracy and from the
earliest days a federal structure was set up. Doctors had their own
organisation, based very largely on collegial principles. The nurses
were separately organised under hospital matrons and the hospital system
was served by a third group -- the hospital administrators.
Partly because of the problems created by this uneasy combination, and
partly for political reasons, the 1980s saw a dramatic shift from the
principles of politics and planning to those of managerialism and the
market.
I think there is quite a lot to be said in favour of these changes.
I would have preferred them to have come from a government that I was
sure was committed to the underlying principles of the NHS, and perhaps
the process by which they have been introduced could have been much
better managed, but there is much to be said for market mechanisms and
even more to be said for people who are well-trained in professional
management practices.
In a Boston hospital recently the head of nursing services told me of
their research into how to reduce length of patient stay. She believed
that many of their procedures were based on tradition and rule-of-thumb
rather than on any scientifically tested principles and she told me they
were mounting a series of experiments to find the optimum periods for
convalescence.
Hospitals are probably like most other organisations in this regard.
It is probable that the standard routines for delivering healthcare are
bound to some extent by tradition and also reflect political processes
of various interest groups who have established procedures that make
life easier for them.
Mechanisms that enable a search for more efficient ways of doing
things, and mechanisms that allow the patients' interests to have more
weight could make a contribution. The market mechanisms and the new
roles for managers set up by the recent reforms could be partial
answers.
Having Commissioners and GPs who are exercising choice about which
service to buy may make providers ask questions about what these
customers actually want, rather than focusing on what they can provide.
Similarly, having someone with managerial responsibility for the
delivery of a service may enable the questions to be raised and answered
about how the delivery might be improved -- and the change process to be
managed.
Although market mechanisms and managerial practices have their
relevance, there are dangers. One is in imposing a version of
administrative practice that is already both old-fashioned and
stereotyped. The other danger is a lack of sensitivity to the real
challenges to efficient and effective management posed by the existence
of several highly qualified, relatively autonomous, sets of
practitioners within the service, ie the medical, paramedical, and
nursing occupations.
In the past, the NHS was being asked to accept innovations which had
been adopted in the private sector -- the multi-divisional
organisational form, corporate planning, systems of accountability and
responsibility, etc -- but these were sometimes imposed merely as a set
of mechanisms without there being an awareness of the subtleties and
nuances with which they were actually used in the private sector.
Similarly, I believe that in the 1990s we are seeing the imposition of
market relationships, competitive tendering, contracting, and so forth,
without the realisation of what a subtle and high-trust relationship
often exists between provider and supplier in the most advanced private
sector enterprises.
The other matter of major importance is that of the role of the highly
qualified technical specialists. We are in danger of imposing a system
of managers on the NHS without taking due recognition of the presence of
these central technical occupations. I am in favour of managerialism,
but not of it being the exclusive concern of professional managers.
A great deal of thinking needs to be done about the role of
clinicians, nurses and paramedics in management structures, particularly
vis-a-vis professional managers.
What structures do we need, what training should each of these groups
have in management and administration? What information systems do we
need, providing information to whom? How is customer awareness best
fostered?
At a time when authorities such as Charles Handy are identifying the
federal form of organisation as a good model for high-technology private
enterprises, it would be foolish to throw away the best bits of
federalism in hospitals.
There is a need to provide management education for all senior
healthcare staff whether medical, nursing, paramedical, administrative
or whatever. And I use the word ''education'' rather than ''training''.
We should not be in the business of recycling current private sector
management practices. Our programmes should be concerned with sharing
some of the management principles underlying these practices, in
equipping healthcare staff with the means to be flexible in developing
appropriate management practices, and in fostering organisational
learning to cope with the changing demands of healthcare delivery
through to the next century.
Arthur Francis, Professor of Corporate Strategy at the University of
Glasgow Business School's Healthcare Management Centre, was talking to
Yvonne Wightman.

THIS week's announcement of a #50m redevelopment of Cumbernauld Town
Centre offers one of the most important opportunities for retail
expansion in Scotland in recent years.
With most town centres already redeveloped over the past 10 years, and
a Scotish Office brake on out-of-town development widely expected,
considerable interest from major retail chains can be expected. The
scheme will be carried out by Arrowcroft Group plc and represents a
final major flourish from Cumbernauld Development Corporation before it
is wound up.
David Mitchell, the corporation's chairman, said: ''The redevelopment
is the single most important project the corporation has embarked upon,
and it will provide the range and quality of shopping facilities
required to meet the needs of residents of the town and surrounding
communities well into the next century.''
The project will provide 300,000 sq ft of additional shopping,
including four anchor stores, about 50 individual shops, 1200 car
parking spaces, and a new bus station.
On completion, it will have almost doubled the existing shopping to
around 675,000 sq ft and increased the total number of car parking
spaces to more than 3000.
The development will be fully integrated with the existing shopping
centre and a new civic square will be created adjacent to the bus
station. Extensive alterations will be made to existing traffic
management and pedestrian circulation at the town centre.
Central Way (part of the A8011), which has bisected the central area
since it was originally constructed in the mid-sixties, will be closed
to through traffic and the existing Asda store relocated. Asda is
investing #13.8m in the construction of a new 45,000 sq ft (net) store
at Central Way and Tryst Road.
The first stage of the road alterations at the centre is due to start
at the end of this month. Roundabouts will be created on Carbrain Road
and a new car park formed on part of the former Seafar Primary School
site. The other roadworks alterations involved will take place
progressively during 1995 and 1996.
Daniel Carter, a director of Arrowcroft, said: ''The physical layout
of Cumbernauld's central area will be totally transformed. We will
increase the range and choice of shopping facilities by specifically
targeting major store groups and high-street retailers not presently
represented in the centre.
''The whole area will be pedestrianised. Construction work on the new
shops will start as soon as the existing Asda store has been demolished,
and the first of the new shopping outlets will open for business towards
the end of 1997.''

SCOTLAND'S banks are more patriotic in their property investment
decisions than Scottish insurance companies which tend to prefer to
invest south of the border, claims one of Scotland's senior surveyors.
Introducing his firm's annual report on the Scottish property market,
David Wright of property consultants Weatherall Green &amp; Smith said the
Scottish banks were important supporters of property investment last
year.
''The Scottish banks have continued their support of Scottish property
sectors during the past year -- and there is increasing evidence that
their hands-on approach has been more prudent than the less patient
approach taken in many cases by their English counterparts,'' he said.
''On the other hand, there is not the same continuing support to
Scottish property from the Scottish assurance institutions.'' The
insurers had not been prominent bidders in Scottish investment sales --
in a number of cases they actually disinvested in Scotland, yet were
active buyers in the South-east of England.
English-based funds and property companies were tending to become the
largest investors in Scottish property.
David Wright went on to predict increasing confidence in Scotland's
market this year. ''In recent months there has been an uplift in
interest rates -- and we are subjected to a government which limps from
one crisis to another -- but these unfavourable factors are offset by
the fact that real estate is still cheap in historic terms,'' he said.
The Weatherall report, Scotland 95, highlights out-of-town retailing
as the most active sector north of the border. Ironically, the very
reason these parks were developed -- low rentals and easy access -- had
now turned full circle. Rentals were now on a par with some town centres
and some retail parks had developed their very own traffic jams and
delays.

LONDON promoter Barry Hearn is confident that Chris Eubank's next
''world tour'' fight against WBO middleweight champion Steve Collins
will go ahead in Belfast on Saturday, February 11, despite a contract
wrangle with Sky TV.
Sky, who are midway through a #10m eight-fight deal with the WBO
super-middleweight champion, had approved Eubank's original date with
Ulsterman Ray Close at the King's Hall in Belfast.
However, with Close having pulled out because of abnormalities in a
brain scan, Hearn revealed that the satellite station is unhappy about
the notice given over the change of opponent and the purse promised to
Dubliner Collins.
Sky have declined to comment on the dispute, but a spokesman for
Hearn's Matchroom organisation said: ''We hope everything will be
resolved satisfactorily by tomorrow afternoon. Barry will be seeing Sky
to iron one or two things out.''
Hearn had announced earlier: ''Our contract with Sky says we have to
allow them six weeks' notice before switching, or selecting an opponent,
although in this case we had no choice because of the sad news about Ray
Close.
''We have only been able to give Sky four weeks' notice and they are
saying this disrupts their scheduling. But I haven't given up hope of a
fight on February 11.''
There have been suggestions, however, that Sky are looking for a way
out of their contract with Eubank, whose four fights to date have failed
to capture big viewing figures.
Meanwhile, Belfast's No.1-rated bantamweight challenger, Wayne
McCullough, has rejected a #330,000 offer by ''Prince'' Naseem Hamed's
promoter, Frank Warren, for a match with his Sheffield-based fighter.
Warren had wanted McCullough as the next challenger to Hamed's WBC
super-bantamweight international championship, with the Belfast boxer's
rating unaffected if he had lost. Warren said: ''McCullough against
Hamed would be a massive fight. We were prepared to go to Dublin, but
McCullough's manager, Matt Tinley, wasn't interested and said that Wayne
was going for the world title immediately.''

ENGLAND'S rugby selectors have named an unchanged team for the
Twickenham showdown with France on February 14.
Manager Jack Rowell, delighted with his men's winning start against
Ireland in Dublin, admitted that it was an easy decision for England's
selectors. ''It was not really a meeting,'' he said. ''There were no
positions that needed scrutiny, although Martin Johnson is doubtful
after the return of his hamstring troubles.''
Leicester lock Johnson passed a fitness test before the encounter with
Ireland, only for his muscle problems to return in the closing moments
of the game, forcing him to leave the field.
If Johnson does not make it, his deputy will be the huge, uncapped
Bristol lock Simon Shaw, who was put on stand-by before the team
travelled to Dublin last week. He will join the squad for training at
Roehampton on Sunday. Team:
M J Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), W D C Carling (Harlequins),
captain, J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R Andrew
(Wasps), K P P Bracken (Bristol); J Leonard, B C Moore (both
Harlequins), V E Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C Bayfield, T
A K Rodber (both Northampton), D Richards (Leicester), B B Clarke
(Bath). Replacements -- J E B Callard,  G R Dawe, P R de Glanville, S O
Ojomoh (all Bath), C D Morris (Orrell), G C Rowntree (Leicester).

ANDREW Oldcorn found the change from the Dubai Dessert Classic to the
East of Scotland Golfers' Alliance outing 48 hours later just too much
at Winterfield, Dunbar, yesterday. Oldcorn, who was up with the leaders
at the halfway cut in Dubai, finished three strokes behind Gary Weir,
who won with a two-under-par 63 in the very cold but otherwise fine
conditions.
Weir went round with four birdies, including 2s at the short fourth
and eleventh holes and two bogeys. Leading scores:
Scratch: 63 -- G Weir (Braid Hills DR). 65 -- E McIntosh (Braid Hills
DR). 66 -- A Oldcorn (Dalmahoy), A McLean (Duddingston), I Young (Braid
Hills DR). 67 -- D Hardie (Harburn), C Morris (Duddingston), P Wardell
(Longniddry).
Handicap (Paterson Medal): 62 -- D Hardie (5) bih, I Wilson
(Glenbervie, 7). 63 -- G Clark (Duddingston, 8), G Johnston (Glenbervie,
9), R Gibson (Newbattle, 5). 64 -- B Allan (Peebles, 6), W Dyet (Ratho
Park, 12), P Ritchie (Bathgate, 9).

ENGLAND finally have sent for Mark Ramprakash but refused to admit
they had reacted too slowly to Graeme Hick's tour-ending injury.
While Ramprakash left the A side in India and headed for Australia to
become the twenty-second member of this winter's Ashes party, Hick
prepared to head home for tests of a different kind. A slipped disc has
cut short his promising campaign, an operation may be necessary, and he
may even miss the start of the next domestic season.
But of more immediate concern to England supporters both at home and
Down Under will be the fact that his place in the fourth Test is being
taken by rusty all-rounder Chris Lewis rather than an in-form
Ramprakash.
Lewis has played a handful of one-day matches over the past four
months, while Ramprakash spent December preparing for the A tour -- and
the first few weeks of January scoring runs galore in India.
The young Middlesex batsman will arrive in Adelaide tomorrow. But if
England had responded immediately to another injury crisis last weekend,
he could have been here in time to face Australia today.
''We didn't think Hick wouldn't play, because he's had back problems
before,'' said manager Keith Fletcher. ''We thought it was just a stiff
back and he would get over it as before.''
Today, however, two specialists -- one in Adelaide, the other in
Worcester -- studied the evidence provided by a hospital scan and agreed
that Hick must not play again this tour because the ''prolapsed'' disc
is affecting a nerve.
In fairness to England's management, the latest injury problems have
come three at a time.
While Hick was flat on his back in Bendigo on Sunday, Alec Stewart's
recovery bid ended with another blow to an already broken finger, and
Neil Fairbrother's damaged shoulder failed to improve as expected. ''As
far as I'm concerned they are not in contention for the final Test in
Perth,'' said Fletcher.
The moment Stewart was hit again while playing against Victoria might
have been the time to send for Ramprakash.
But Fletcher said: ''We've lost three batters -- Fairbrother, Stewart,
and Hick -- in the space of four days and you cannot plan for things
like that.''
At least Ramprakash and Lewis will be in Perth in case of more
injuries before next week's final Test.

FRANCE have dropped giant lock Olivier Merle for the match against
England, with Olivier Brouzet, the 22-year-old Grenoble forward, coming
in for his third cap. The rest of the team is unchanged.
Merle was reprimanded, but cleared by the French Rugby Federation on
Tuesday of butting Welsh prop Ricky Evans in last Saturday's match in
Paris, which the French won 21-9. However, coach Pierre Berbizier, who
has been leading a campaign to clean up French rugby, stressed that
Merle had been dropped for his attack on Evans.
Brouzet, Merle's former team-mate at Grenoble, made his debut last
season when he replaced the then-captain Olivier Roumat for the Five
Nations game against Scotland. He lost his place to Merle during
France's successful tour of New Zealand, but was recalled against Canada
in December, only to pull out with a muscle strain. That left the door
open to Merle. Team:
J-L Sadourny (Colomiers); E Ntamack (Toulouse), P Sella (Agen), T
Lacroix (Dax), P Saint-Andre (Montferrand), captain; C Deylaud
(Toulouse), G Accoceberry (Begles); L Benezech (Racing CF), J-M Gonzalez
(Bayonne), C Califano (Toulouse), O Roumat (Dax), O Brouzet (Grenoble),
A Benazzi (Agen), L Cabannes (Racing CF), P Benetton (Agen).

<HEADLINE>Lib Dems want drastic pruning of farming's bureaucratic jungle</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>15</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980172965</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DRASTIC pruning of the bureaucratic jungle which faces farmers as
they try to manage the various EU support schemes is called for by the
Scottish Liberal Democrats in their consultation document, Farming and
the Scottish Rural Community.
''Farmers today have to juggle with a myriad of Euro schemes in order
to make ends meet -- it's mind-bending, bureaucratic, a waste of time,
and it's completely unnecessary,'' say the Liberal Democrats.
Instead, they propose one simple system. It would be based, they say,
on countryside management contracts, available to all farmers and land
managers. Each would be able to choose from a wide-ranging ''menu'' of
options, varying regionally.
Each item on the menu would be worth a certain number of points, with
each point carrying a money value related to the overall fund available.
Each farmer could claim payments up to a maximum per holding.
''Experience gained from the operation of the Environmentally
Sensitive Area scheme in the UK, and similar schemes elsewhere in the
EU, prove that this system would be both popular and effective,'' says
the consultation paper. ''It would remove incentives for
over-production, could be cheaply and efficiently administered, and
would allow farmers to use their land to the best advantage.''
It is envisaged that a few special cases of direct payment would
continue for the foreseeable future. This applies particularly to the
ewe and suckler cow premium schemes, and the Less Favoured Area
supplementary system -- on which the survival of hill and upland farming
depends.
Mrs Ray Michie, MP for Argyll and Bute -- the party's spokeswoman on
rural affairs -- accepted that any comprehensive plan for reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy would take years to implement. Meantime, she
called for a restoration of Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances to
the levels of two years ago, and the index-linking of other main grants
to hill farmers, such as Suckler Cow Premium and Sheep Annual Premium.
Quotas in general were in a mess, and inept administration by
Whitehall was making the situation a great deal worse than it need be,
she indicated. The consultation document singles out Sheep Annual
Premium as being managed in a particularly unjust way.
On milk quota, the UK as a whole is described as grossly
under-supplied, while other EU members are sitting on a surplus -- ''an
injustice only made possible by the Government's continuing acquiescence
in the secret deals of the Council of Ministers.''
The mismanagement of all forms of quota is depicted, not as an EU
problem, but as ''home-grown in London.''
The Liberal-Democrat solutions are: Allow for greater flexibility in
the allocation and administration of quota; push for additional quota
allocation for the UK; make milk quota tradeable across EU borders; and
curb speculation in quota by forcing non-producing holders to sell it
within a specified time limit, except in areas where quota is now
ringfenced.
On lowland farms, the consultation document advocates the eventual
abolition of set-aside, claiming that ''no amount of tinkering will ever
make an inherently unworkable policy useful.'' It also calls for the
provision of land for smaller holdings; the promotion of machinery rings
and co-operative marketing ventures; and encouragement for retailers to
stock local produce.
Close monitoring of land use and sale, with local authorities given
powers of pre-emptive purchase to prevent damaging changes of ownership
in exceptional cases, is also proposed. Crofting is commended as the
kind of low-input, low output farming which should be encouraged, not
merely to survive, but to expand and prosper. De-crofting of land should
at all times be discouraged.
In a section on diversification, the paper points out that often the
best land for windfarms will be found in the remoter upland areas. ''For
once, therefore, it may be the hill farmers who stand to benefit.
Renewable energy may give them a rare and ideal opportunity to diversify
and increase the value of their land at the same time. The
Liberal-Democrats propose a mandatory code of practice for windfarm
development, including requirements for full consultation with local
communities, and continuous monitoring of performance.
The paper concludes that it is easy to be pessimistic about the future
of the countryside. ''The rural population continues to decline, turning
many old communities into ghettoes for the elderly and unemployed. Many
farmers teeter on the brink of bankruptcy. Others are driven to despair
by senseless bureaucracy. Nobody in power seems to care who owns the
land, or what they do with it.''

One Scots company, reports Terry Houston, has made a dramatic if
unexpected impact on the electronics servicing world
GAINING a foothold in the computer industry was the last thing in the
minds of Douglas and Tom Brands when they formed their own company in
Greenock in 1986.
The brothers were more familiar with the logistics of fitting out
power systems on giant North Sea oil platforms than with the world of
the micro-chip.
But in less than a decade, in the super-heated competition of the
crowded electronics markets, the Brands brothers have gone from scratch
to rivalling the Japanese service sector in efficiency and quality
control.
Their firm, Brands Electronics, in less than nine years has carved out
a new kind of service market used by many of the world's biggest
computer companies.
''We have had many Japanese electronics industry come to look at our
operation,'' says Douglas. ''They regard our quality control as equal on
their own. We
take that as a big compliment.''
The 40-year-old runs the electronics side of the business while Tom
(39) looks after its electrical engineering sister company.
''We have evolved a system of total flexibility. For our customers, we
can set up an assembly line to handle any particular task at extremely
short notice. On repairs we do a door-to-door service, delivering
anywhere in Europe within five days.''
That sort of flexibility has seen Brands International's turnover rise
dramatically, year on year, by a factor of 80%. This year it is set to
reach between #12m and #15m.
In what is a cyclical trade, Brands International has a core staff of
200. That number regularly doubles when the rush is on. In a matter of
days, the company can set up a full production line, working three
shifts, to handle anything from eliminating faults to quality testing or
''customising'' electronic hardware for European clients.
What makes Brands stand out from the pack though, is that it has taken
the whole concept of servicing to new levels of involvement between
itself and its clients.
For Far East manufacturers, it is now a recognised ''staging post''
for electronic equipment being shipped into Europe for clients.
Needs of European companies can often change while the goods are still
in transit on the high seas.
Rather than have products shipped back to the US or the Far East for
time-consuming design changes, they instead alert Brands that a
consignment is coming in.
The Scottish company then sets up the type of operation needed to
handle either high-volume or low-volume changes, on arrival. It can
handle alterations to anything up to 5000 monitors a day, if required.
It also deals with component changes, quality checks, fault-finding,
and, of course, service warranties and after-warranty service.
But the Brands brothers haven't stopped there. As the electronics
industry continues its drive towards ever better production
cost-efficiency, the company's middle-man role has taken on an important
new dimension.
For client manufacturers, it has now become part of their actual
production schedules. The Scots company is supplying components direct
to firms -- feeding into their production lines on a six-hourly basis,
24 hours a day.
It is so finely tuned an operation that the new components can be
slotted into the assembly line process within 15 minutes of delivery.
Being an electronics company with an electrical engineering background
-- fields which often overlap -- means the company has the skills not
only to slot into assembly lines but to actually set them up and
organise data and communications systems.
''It just evolved,'' says Douglas.''We have some competitors, but I
don't know of other firms which have developed their services to such an
in-depth level. The electronics industry is constantly trying to bring
down overheads.
''Our role isn't just feeding components into the production process:
We also forecast to manufacturers the quantities, and flow, they are
going to need in the months ahead.
''We are very inter-active with our clients. We now have such a good
relationship with our overseas manufacturers that we sometimes find
ourselves doing a job and shipping it on to customers before getting
round to talking to the manufacturer about the price. That's the sort of
trust that exists. We know the deal will be a fair one.''
It wasn't always thus. Breaking into the foreign market was, in
Douglas's words, a slog. For years, on regular trips to the Far East the
brothers found themselves knocking on closed doors.
Just when Douglas had concluded the overseas missions were a waste of
time, the door opened a chink. In Taiwan they were invited in to meet
the president of a major company. That was one November. Two months
later the company was in Scotland and finalising a deal.
''Far East clients take a long time to take you into their confidence.
But when they decide to do business with you, they are very loyal,'' he
says.
Since then Brands International has built up an impressive client list
abroad, featuring houshold names like Sony, Mitsubishi, Samsung, Gold
Star and Daewoo.
Douglas who was recently on a Strathclyde business development trade
mission to China, reckons it is the nation destined to become the
world's next commercial superpower. It is now a regular stop for him in
his quarterly business trips to the Far East.
''They've got everything -- a low wage base, a huge and literate
society, and big Government investment,'' he says.''When all that comes
to fruition, watch out. They'll be the world's biggest new commercial
force.''
If and when that happens, Brands International intends to be around to
win more business for Scotland.
Right now, though, the Brands brothers aren't singing the blues. In
nine short years they have gone from a single factory in Pottery Street
to establishing a second one in Greenock. They have also created a
20-strong office in Eindhoven, Holland to help them service European
clients.
Ironically, the company is probably better known abroad than in
Scotland. ''It's not the first time a Scottish company has been in Korea
doing a deal on equipment, only to be flabbergasted when the Koreans
tell them the warranty servicing will be handled by a company in their
own county, or even worse, their own town,'' says Douglas.
''They didn't know of our existence -- or that we have such a big
international reputation.''
It does sound like Scotland: Nowhere else could a company with a #15m
turnover find its light so well hidden under a bushel.

''There is a quaint belief built into
the fat packages currently being
handed out to senior executives
that only the actions of a few
people at the top determine the
destiny of this business or that''
FROM the Institute of Directors and the CBI all the way to Labour's
front bench, a tentative consensus appears to be emerging that the
Executive Support Agency is sorely in need of reform.
In recent years this little-known body beavered quietly away -- its
key endeavours devolved to hundreds of remuneration committees in
boardrooms up and down the land -- to make sure that our top executives
are properly rewarded for their achievements in office and properly
protected if they are unfortunate enough to find themselves victims of
corporate breakdown.
This shadowy agency set about its task with a will. At corporate agm
after agm, small shareholders were slapped down with patrician disdain
if they dared to question what their company was proposing to pay its
senior executives. Institutional shareholders -- no strangers to fat
six-figure salaries themselves for managing other people's money --
generally sat on their hands.
The institutions had the votes. Small shareholders had little more
than their aggrieved voices. The Agency's agenda was ruthlessly
enforced. To packages of basic pay and bonuses were added lavish share
options and handsome pension contributions. The master stroke was the
two -- or in some notorious cases, three or more -- year rolling
contracts to ensure that even an early ignominious exit from the
executive floor is thickly feather-bedded.
With the arrival of the seven-figure executive in the UK -- not yet
commonplace but by no means unusual any more -- the Executive Support
Agency might have felt that its mission is more or less complete.
So why have executive rewards suddenly become a national cause
celebre, with senior executives of privatised utilities being dragged
before a Commons committee to explain themselves; the CBI and IOD
mounting damage limitation exercises; and some institutional
shareholders at last waking up to the problem and voting against some of
the worst excesses, like three-year rolling contracts?
As late as the mid-eighties, the six-figure executive was a relative
rarity. In 1988, Scottish Business Insider could find only 22 Scottish
bosses earning #100,000 or more. This year all of the magazine's top 25
Scottish earners were clocking in at at least #275,000. A rival Scottish
listing recently stopped counting six-figure earners in Scotland when it
reached 160.
We can assume that such local intelligence gathering has grown more
sophisticated over the years. But something much more fundamental has
also taken place. Up until the mid-eighties, executive pay grew roughly
in line with increases in gross average earnings. But since 1988, the
trend in average rewards enjoyed by the most senior UK executives has
undergone an Alpine upwards shift, leaving the trend in gross average
earnings for the rest of us in work wallowing far in its wake.
In March 1988 Chancellor Nigel Lawson lopped 2p off the standard rate
of income tax and cut the top rate from 60% to 40%. That gave top
earners a very significant windfall on their existing salaries. The
bigger the salary, the bigger the windfall. All that extra disposable
income must also have planted a taste for even more spending power.
Ever since, almost regardless of corporate performance in recession
and recovery, despite a few honourable exceptions, reward packages for
top executives have grown and grown.
The remuneration committees which recommend these increases are
generally made up of non-executive directors, typically executives
elsewhere, themselves dependent on other remuneration committees to
judge how much they are worth.
The system is deeply flawed. At worst it operates on the
you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours principle. At best, it has reward
inflation all round built right into its foundations.
Most remuneration committees seek advice from independent consultants
who regularly survey earning patterns across similar posts elsewhere.
Indeed the going-rate-for-the-job is the most frequently-cited
justification for some of the most contentious packages.
On Tuesday Cedric Brown of British Gas was telling MPs his #475,000
salary is, in fact, less than it might be for running the seventh
largest company in the country. ''To my knowledge there are at least 50
or more chief executives earning more than that,'' he told the select
committee.
Poor Cedric Brown and other business leaders deploying such benchmarks
in self-justification seem blithely unaware of just how ironic that line
of argument really is. The last people in Britain who insisted: ''It's
the going rate for the job'' were union leaders like Hughie Scanlon and
Jack Jones, during the pay disputes of the sixties, seventies and early
eighties. The very people whose power Mrs Thatcher set out to break in
1979.
Every union negotiator worth his salt then justified every pay claim
on the same formula: the rise in the retail price index and what
increases other workers in similar jobs were winning. If the going rate
was the wrong way to reward workers then, what makes it the right way to
reward top executives now?
The government's current line is that the executive pay issue is one
for shareholders to resolve. That, frankly, is a cop-out. Small
shareholders who care about the worst abuses haven't the votes to swing
decisions. Unless some means can be found of forcing large institutional
shareholders to take a view on who gets what and vote to curb excesses,
nothing will change.
Until very recently, most City opinion could not see what the problem
was. Large salaries and, in the good years, big bonuses are woven into
the fabric of the Square Mile. Senior accountants and corporate lawyers
have, for years, enjoyed six-figure lifestyles. Why shouldn't the people
running Britain's top companies enjoy some of that cream too?
The counter argument is simple. Much of the cream licked up in recent
years has been earned, not by growing the business, expanding into new
markets or launching innovative products or services. It has been
earned, in the privatised utilities and elsewhere, by hacking into the
payroll, taking cost out of the operation, and disposing of peripheral
businesses.
To be seen to be taking bigger and bigger rewards not in return for
risk but for wielding the corporate axe sends all the wrong signals to
the insecure workforce which remains. The case against disproportionate
executive rewards at this time is that they sow resentment within
companies and demotivate those whose efforts will be required to grow
the business when better times return.
There is a quaint belief built into the fat packages currently being
handed out to senior executives that only the actions of a few people at
the top determine the destiny of this business or that.
I talked to the chairman of a smaller family-owned business the other
day who told me he was spending more time away from company duties in a
variety of public roles. ''The really disturbing thing,'' he confided
''is that my business seems to be doing better now that I'm not there
all the time, than it did when I was.''
One anecdote does not constitute a fundamental law of behaviour. But
the more I see of the workings of companies large and small in this
country, the more I am convinced that their success is down to skills,
efforts and ingenuity of many people at many different levels in the
organisation. The idea that success depends on the actions of a few
people in the boardroom no longer holds water.
If the roots of success are widely distributed in the modern
organisation, so should access to reward be. By appearing to have their
own snouts deepest in the trough, Britain's executives are guilty of
sending out the wrong message at the wrong time. Their self-indulgence
is endangering this country's corporate recovery.

TAKEOVER fever swept the City yet again yesterday with punters buying
TSB shares which surged by 16p to 248p with a market value of #3795m.
Turnover was a substantial 25.2 million shares which comes on top of
Tuesday's 11 million on a price rise of 8[1/2]p.
This week has already seen the #8900m bid for Wellcome, confirmation
that Cadbury Schweppes intends putting up #1000m for Dr Pepper/Seven Up,
while on a quieter note, Sainsbury is paying #290m for the Texas stores.
There was a general feeling among fund managers late last year that
there would be a large amount of corporate activity in 1995, something
which the financial public relations firms were also suggesting.
One leading fund manager, who is fairly bearish on the UK equity
market, said last night that the takeover rumours put him in a difficult
position. He would prefer to sell stocks but would look rather stupid if
he did and then a bid was popped on the table the next day.
The current self-promotion campaign by Hanson on television and
elsewhere makes some people believe there could be credibility in a bid
for Argyll with the Safeway and Presto food retailer providing a more
reliable earnings stream than is available almost anywhere else.
The TSB rumours were largely concentrated on there being an approach
from either the Banque National de Paris or Dresdner Bank.
However, BNP has said that it does not want to get into UK retail
banking. The culture clash inherent in a German bank trying to adapt to
the very fast changes and intense competition with the long established
UK banks fighting it out in the High Street would seem to be
insurmountable.
TSB has been the focus of most takeover speculation for the last three
or fours years on the basis that it is an attractive target with the
strongest balance sheet of any of the UK banks. But it does not seem to
be going anywhere in particular in a sector where there are too many
participants including the increasingly more aggressive building
societies.
The most logical move in some ways would be for Abbey National, which
has a more southern UK bias, to take over the TSB although the
rationalisation costs through branch closures would be extremely high.
But it would create a very financially strong combination with above
average quality of earnings thanks to Abbey National's mortgage business
and undisputed expertise in treasury operations and TSB's strengths in
insurance, UDT credit, and the Hill Samuel merchant bank.
TSB said that it knew of no reason for the share price rise.

CASE HISTORY
FOR the past eight months Ian McNeil has been a franchisee with
Autosmart, a company whose business is to distribute chemicals used in
the automotive industry. Covering an area that extends to the north and
west of Glasgow, Ian takes his seven-ton truck/ showroom complete with a
product range of almost 200 items with him on his daily rounds.
The first two months were ''disastrous'' according to Ian, however,
today business is ''fine'' and he is satisfied with the progress he has
made.
But Ian's story is not specifically about working long hours and
weekends, but one of getting started in business in the first place,
especially raising the funds.
After working offshore for 12 years, being laid off, and consequently
unemployed for almost two years, he had an urge to become self-employed.
He studied the franchising concept thoroughly; brochures that had been
sent to him by franchisors were examined with a fine-tooth comb.
Autosmart was the franchise that appealed most, but how was he going to
find the necessary funds to realise his ambitions?
Ian went to the Local Enterprise Agency at Queenslie Industrial Estate
and outlined his plans. Despite him having no funds he was advised to
make out a business plan as grants were available in many cases.
The financing that Ian required was not available and he resorted to
raising money in the family. With this development, his name was put
forward to the Glasgow Regeneration Fund, Strathclyde Regional Council
and Glasgow Opportunities. He was also required to attend a two-day
seminar for those starting a small business.
Ian's funds were matched by certain grants and loans at low rates of
interest. A package was drawn up and presented to Autosmart, but he
still required an overdraft facility with the bank. He approached nine
banks for an overdraft, including his own bank, and was refused each
time, the difficulty being that he had no business track record. Some
time later his own bank called him and suggested he took out an
insurance policy to cover the overdraft. It had taken 10 months to reach
this stage.
A four-week product knowledge course was attended by him and his wife
after which there was on-the-field training. He was not left alone and a
support manager still travels with him regularly on his rounds.
With Autosmart there are no royalties or management fees, the only
condition is that franchisees must buy stock from the franchisor.
And what advice would Ian give to would-be franchisees?
''You must study the franchisor thoroughly. Autosmart was my eighth
choice. With many it's a case of meeting in hotel lobbies for a quick
chat and half-an-hour later they want a cheque for #10,000. With
Autosmart it was quite different and it was some time before they asked
for any money.''

THE Dumfries newspaper that Bill Goldie had given almost 30 years'
service to as a compositor was no different to those in other parts of
the country. Linotype machines that pumped out metal lines of type had
surrendered to the VDU where letters are pinged on to a screen by a
keyboard operator. Gone too were the heavy formes of type and galleys of
text; today printing work is stored on a computer disc the size of a
cigarette packet and weighs a few ounces.
Redundancy for Bill came six years ago, but by becoming a franchisee
of Prontaprint in the town's busy English Street, his time-served
talents have not gone to waste. However, was it just a case of handing
over a wedge of cash and getting on with it? After all the business had
been established for some nine years.
Bill said: ''The franchisee then was a head teacher of science in one
of the town's schools and because of this commitment he was unable to
give the business his full attention and was quite keen to sell. He felt
he had taken the venture as far as he could but knew it could do better
if it were in full-time hands.''
A transfer arrangement seemed straightforward although the deal could
not go through without Bill first consulting the franchisor and having
meetings with senior personnel who in this case were the franchise
manager and franchise director. The purpose of these meetings was to
establish his suitability for the task and to impress upon him the
importance of the need for a good and close partnership -- a joint deal.
Prontaprint gives successful franchisees a four-week training course
which covers bookkeeping, marketing, administration, and practical work.
In the first week of business a company trainer will be on hand to keep
an eye on things. Curiously, few people with backgrounds in print take
up such franchises and when Bill went on his training course he found
himself in the company of people who had been bank managers, company
directors and in one case an Army officer.
He was also encouraged by the franchisor to speak to existing
franchisees which he did by visiting the Carlisle office and meeting
franchisees in Hamilton and Kilmarnock.
His decision to introduce desktop publishing ''probably my best
investment ever'' to a business at his own expense and conviction to be
successful, has certainly paid dividends. It has also become something
of a family concern with brother-in-law Steve and daughter Fiona
employed full-time with three other members of staff.
Business has gone up by 150% since he took over. Printing and
finishing accounts for 45% of business with 35% relating to copying and
colour copying. His office can handle work from the simple letterhead
through to NCR invoices to finished artwork for magazines with full
colour separations.
Prontaprint franchisees pay a royalty based on turnover, the
percentage payable dropping as sales increase. They are not bound to
nominated suppliers for materials although when it is considered that
there are 280 shops in the UK, good deals can be struck by the
franchisor.
Perhaps it might be best summed up by Bill when asked what advice he
would offer to those contemplating going down the franchise road: ''It
can be a demanding job at times but it can also be very rewarding,'' But
he warns: ''It is not easy work and there are days when machinery breaks
down, however, on good days it can be very satisfying.''

IF you are one who has been looking for a new direction following
redundancy or receiving a cash windfall, then a franchised business
might just be the move for you. It has been estimated that more than
250,000 people in Britain are seeking to become self-employed, to be
their own boss. Franchised companies in this country turn over #15bn
each year and employ almost 250,000 people in 30,000 businesses. They
have also shown a remarkable success rate when compared with those that
have been independently started.
Investment sums vary from franchise to franchise. To become a
franchisee of the McDonald's restaurant chain a sum in the region of
#500,000 would be required, however, there are other opportunities that
will put you in business after an investment of #5000.
What type of business you are attracted to may largely depend on your
existing skills and how they can be used to their best advantage but the
beauty of most franchises is that they are not difficult to learn and
after a short training period you could be up and running in your own
business with help from your partner, the franchisor.
The importance of the relationship between franchisor and franchisee
cannot be emphasised strongly enough. Without each other you are nothing
and it is vital that the partnership-ethos to be formed is understood
clearly by the new franchisee.
What you will give is capital to set up and operate the business; and
time, a lot at the beginning, especially from the family; and effort to
expand and develop what you will live, eat and sleep.
The franchisor will not abandon you, he will give you his support. He
will give you territorial domination of a tried and tested successful
business; rights to protected intellectual property whether it be in
property, operations, or services; training for you and your staff in
operation techniques and office procedures.
Although you are your own boss you will have contractual obligations
to keep with the franchisor. You will have to adhere to his business and
operation guidelines; his desire to maintain the standards that made his
pilot scheme successful is fundamentally important to him.
However, before making any commitment ask the franchisor for the
addresses of existing franchisees so that you may discuss with them what
it's like to run that franchise. Ask for a complete list so that you may
select from it yourself. A good franchisor will encourage this action.
To buy into a franchise you may be required to invest from #5000
upwards, but there may be hidden extra costs. Find out what is required
in royalty payments or if there is a management fee; you may be required
to purchase materials or stock from your franchisor. These could all add
a burden to your financial calculations.
The importance of preparatory research into franchises that attract
you cannot be overstated. The glossy magazines and literature are all
very appealing but hours invested in study before you finally decide may
save you thousands of pounds later. The British Franchise Association's
survey showed that 84% of franchisees were satisfied with franchisors
and that 68% would renew contracts while 10% would not, 22% remained
undecided.
Naivety can be the franchisee's downfall. It may go against your
nature and be difficult, but it is better to trust no-one, study every
detail and get everything in writing. By attending franchise events,
studying publications, and consulting with franchise experts you will
gradually become well-informed and ready to take on that franchisee
interview.
WHAT'S ON
February 2 and 3: Belfast Franchise Conference and Exhibition.
February 6 and 7: Irish Franchise Exhibition, Dublin.
March 3: Franchise Discovery Day, Norwich.
March 24-26: Spring National Franchise Exhibition, Olympia, London.
April: 21-23: International Franchise Expo, Washington DC.
WHAT IS FRANCHISING?
It is a partnership in business between an established company (the
franchisor) and a newcomer to the business (the franchisee).
HOW DOES IT WORK?
The franchisee purchases licensed rights to copy the business of a
franchisor in a specific area for an agreed time.
The franchisee invests capital, time and energy into ''his business''
which has been copied from the franchisor's proven success.
The franchiser's business expands into a new area with the minimum of
investment.
The franchisee benefits from a successful business idea.

FUND managers Govett &amp; Co has leapt into the top ranks of asset
management with the #145m acquisition of Duff &amp; Phelps of the US which
will boost the overall funds under management from $9000m to $50bn
(#31bn).
The advantage to Govett is that it gives the British company a
critical mass in global terms as well as being able to market itself
much more effectively in the US to the large institutions.
Govett Duff &amp; Phelps will be a distinctive enough name to dispel the
belief in some quarters that it is linked with brokers Hoare Govett.
Duff &amp; Phelps achieved net income of just over $18m last year so it is
being acquired at 13[1/2] times earnings and at a price equivalent to 1%

HOTEL boss Jeremy Osborne is the driving force at his Rhu
establishment in more ways than one. A computer enthusiast, he has
perfected a system producing detailed maps and road directions to ensure
that guests keep rolling up to the Rosslea Hall Hotel.
Tourists can now leave from any spot in Europe with the confidence of
having detailed directions, including road numbers and names and the
estimated driving time, immediately to hand.
''We can supply a pack which estimates the amount of driving time
involved,'' he explains. ''It can even give advice on where to turn off,
making the journey to Rhu much easier.
''For instance, we can get a telephone inquiry from people who might
say: 'OK, book me in -- but how do we get there?' I can produce maps
within two minutes and fax them immediately. It can make a difference!''
It's all part of manager Osborne's business belief that the days are
long gone when hotels were simply places supplying accommodation and
meals. Entertainment, he contends, goes hand in hand with the best of
good service.
''Really,'' he says, ''we have to stay on our toes -- and be pretty
nimble at that!''
Working between two computers at the 40-bedroomed hotel, Osborne is
continually devising campaigns to woo visitors to the yachting village.
His efforts have already earned a coveted national marketing award, and
he will grasp further prizes if he can.
''As well as getting value for money guests like to be semi-organised,
but with choice,'' he says. ''I am determined to draw as many people as
I can to Rhu and Scotland and, of course, get them to stay for as long
as possible!''
Always striving to maintain a competitive edge, Osborne's plans for
the domestic market include ''new for 1995'' a complicated scenario
involving ''the perfect murder!''
Following an innovative, medieval nights programme -- complete with
jesters, traditional music, olde dishes complemented by hearty roasts,
treacle puds and real ale -- Osborne is convinced that the new package
has definite appeal.
''This time we will be involved with professional actors, the Stirling
Heritage Company,'' says Jeremy. ''The scene will be very interesting as
the only people aware of the plot will be the actors and myself!''

LAST year may have been a poor one in terms of the performance of
investment funds given that share markets fell. But in other respects it
can be be regarded as an extremely successful growth period.
Certainly both unit trusts and investment trusts did well, the former
in particular boosted strongly by Personal Equity Plans, which are free
of income tax and capital gains tax. This seems set to continue in the
current year with the increased scope for PEPs, which will be allowed to
invest in corporate bonds and other fixed interest investments, coming
into effect in April.
Management companies are already tumbling over themselves to introduce
the new-style PEPs. The expected growth pre-supposes of course that
share markets do recover their poise over a reasonable period of time
and that PEPs investors appreciate that it is not supposed to be short
term.
Last year the FTSE-100 share index fell by around 10% so the actual
performance of many of the PEPs is not impressive, especially since some
of them had quite high charges.
Year-end figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment
Funds (Autif) show record sales for the year, no mean achievement in a
declining market. Autif goes so far as to describe the industry as
breaking out of the ghetto.
Net retail sales rose 20% from #5000m to #6000m with PEP sales up from
#3300m to #4600m over the year with Unit Trust PEP funds under
management up from #8000m to #12bn.
However, there was a drop in the industry's funds under management
from #96bn to #92bn reflecting falling markets and major disinvestments
by institutions for tax reasons which amounted to an outflow of over
#4000m.
The impact of PEPs can be judged by the fact that the substantial rise
in net retail sales last year over 1993 came not just in declining
markets but in comparison with a year in which the stock market rose by
27%.
In the past, unit trust managers used to despair of attracting
investors when shares were lower, and the investing public certainly did
have a propensity to pile in when markets were rising, often near their
cyclical peak. Much of the attraction of PEPs has been the higher level
of income, which is tax free, that can be achieved against, say, a
building society though naturally there is an additional risk as with
any basically equity form of investment.
Autif director-general Philip Warland said that private unit trust
investors are looking beyond the peaks and troughs of the stock market
and focusing on the long-term rewards. If so, it is mostly through PEPs.
It is estimated that unit trusts now account for over 60% of the total
PEP market.
The association also said that awareness of unit trusts is rising
among younger people and in social groups not traditionally associated
with unit trust investment.So far as investment trusts are concerned,
the actual PEP figures do not become available until the end of the
1994-95 financial year. But there is no reason to believe that they have
not been greatly boosted as well, albeit on a smaller scale. Investment
trust management PEPs grew from #207.5m for 1992-93 to #326.5m in
1993-94 and will undoubtedly show a rise in the current financial year.
Excluding any PEP's breakdown, figures from the Association of
Investment Trusts (AITC) show that last year there were 45 new
investment trusts issued against 30 in the preceding year and the amount
of money raised grew from #1498m in 1993 to #3932.9m.
Assets of the industry stood at around #46bn at the closing stages of
1994 compared with #40.12bn for 1993 and #28.34bn for 1992.

GORDON Terris has joined Caledonian Newspapers as an advertisement
sales consultant from MGN's Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail where
he was advertisement sales director.
Mr Terris, 46, will advise the board on the future strategy of
Caledonian, publishers of The Herald and Evening Times, and on
developing and expanding the current client base.
Welcoming the appointment, Caledonian chief executive Liam Kane said
Mr Terris was joining the company just at the right time as profits were
ahead of budget in the first quarter to end-December.
Operating profits before interest at #1.86m are a substantial #850,000
ahead of the same time last year and the group expects to exceed easily
the #8.2m of 1993-94.
''We have two new editors in place and sales have been increasing in
response to word-of-mouth recommendation, even before the planned spring
promotions for The Herald and Evening Times,'' he said.
''Gordon Terris's appointment will help us maximise advertisement
revenue opportunities resulting from these changes and the company's
revitalised approach to the market,'' Mr Kane added.

FINANCIAL aftershocks from the Japanese earthquake have rocked the net
asset value of Dunedin Japan Investment Trust.
Having already fallen 11.8% to 92.3p during the last six months of
1994 as a result of general weakness in the Tokyo stock market, the
trust, which invests solely in Japan, has suffered a further 9.3%
decline in net asset value to 83.7p in the wake of last week's disaster.
Dunedin Japan has unwound its gearing this month because of the
massive uncertainty surrounding the ultimate cost of repairing the
earthquake damage, with trust manager Nigel Barry expecting it to be in
the top half of estimates that range between #19bn and #63bn.
The extent of government aid is uncertain and it is also not known
whether this will be financed by massive debt issues, pushing bond
yields up and depressing stock market sentiment, or from the Bank of
Japan's reserves, which could stimulate economic recovery.
The decline in Dunedin Japan's net asset value during its first half
came against the backdrop of a 9.1% fall, in sterling terms, in the
Tokyo Stock Exchange Index and a 16.6% plunge in the second section
index. About one-quarter of the trust's funds are invested in
second-line stocks, with the rest in first-section issues, with Ordinary
shareholders' funds of #18.7m and gearing of #715,000 on December 31.
Smaller capitalisation stocks, which had performed strongly during the
first half of 1994, fell sharply during the second half, with yen
strength against the dollar dampening hopes for export earnings.
Profit-taking by foreign investors emerged towards the end of the year
in the Tokyo market and the flotation of the over-valued Japan Telecom
and Japan Tobacco further dented sentiment.
In spite of the sharp fall in net asset value since December 31,
Dunedin Japan's holdings have outperformed both the general stock
exchange and second-section indices.
With between 7% and 8% of the investment trust's funds in construction
and housing-related stocks, it could reap some benefits from the
expensive rebuilding process.
The trust is confident that, after initial stock market uncertainty,
the additional spending on the recovery effort could boost Japan's
economic growth.
Mr Barry said: ''I think the first quarter of this year looks quite
difficult. Looking beyond that, I feel a bit more optimistic.''
He believed what was lost in the first half of 1995 would be made up
in the latter part of the year and in 1996.
* IN both total return and net asset terms, Murray Split Capital
investment trust is still finding it difficult to beat the benchmark FT
All-Share index as yesterday's quarterly results again showed.
Net assets of the Murray Johnstone-run trust for the three months to
end-November fell by 6.7% to #23.9m compared with 6.1% on the FT
All-Share while the total return, which includes reinvested dividends,
was similarly in tow with a 5.6% decline against 5.1%.
Last year's figures told much the same story though the trust's
performance was then at least marginally ahead of the FT index. A
maintained first quarterly dividend of 2.65p will be paid.

TALK of a Norwegian missile, part of a scientific project, heading for
Russia sparked a flight into dollars as investors rushed for a safe
haven.
The rumour proved to be false but even so sterling was sold-off in the
process. However, dealers were reluctant to sell the pound too heavily
given the perception of an early interest rate rise.
Sterling lost over a third-of-a-cent against the dollar to $1.5923 but
was slightly up on the mark at DM2.4152. Its trade-weighted index dipped
by 0.1 to 80.1.
The CBI is proposing to write to Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth
Clarke advising him against an immediate rise in interest rates. Bank of
England Governor Eddie George and Mr Clarke are due to meet on February
2 and expectations are growing for a half-point rise in UK interest
rates taking them to 6.75%.

LUXURY goods group LVMH yesterday reported a 17.4% jump in 1994 sales
and forecast a 20% increase in profit for the year before exceptional
items.
Chairman Bernard Arnault added that the company was looking for a
''very significant'' rise in its 1995 net result.
Sales for the year up to December 31, 1994, of its perfumes, luggage,
wines and spirits climbed to Ffr27.97bn (#3580m) from Ffr23.82bn
(#3040m), the company said.
The company's 1993 profit before exceptionals totalled Ffr2970m
(#380m). After exceptionals, the 1993 figure was Ffr3570m francs
(#455.93m).
All sectors showed a sales increase in 1994 but luxury goods rose more
than beverages, confirming the group's strategy, Arnault told a news
conference.

INVESTMENT in retail systems and efficient distribution networks is
vital for retailers hoping to make profits in today's low-inflation
competitive marketplace.
W H Smith has made such investments over several years and this
enabled it to outperform many of its rivals in the vital trading period
in the run-up to Christmas.
It was able to offer cut-price videos and compact discs, thereby
increasing its market share and still maintain its gross margins. The
strong trading performance of its music businesses, Virgin and Our
Price, helped to offset sluggish book trade in Waterstones and W H Smith
High Street stores.
Its share of losses at the Do-It-All joint venture with Boots dropped
to #2.3m from #7.5m previously. It is confident that Do-It-All will
return to profit in the 1995-96 financial year.
Overall group pre-tax profit in the 26 weeks to November 26 rose by
just 1.1% to #45.2m. The interim dividend was raised by 5% to 5.25p.
Group chief executive Sir Malcolm Field noted that Christmas trading
relied more on December this year because of the Budget and the launch
of the National Lottery.
The company said it is too soon to say what effect the Lottery has had
on its sales. However, rivals have admitted that sales of low-ticket
items such as newspapers have slipped in some stores.
Although growth prospects in the group's US retail business and
specialist UK businesses of Waterstones, Virgin and Our Price are
thought to be strong, there is work to be done on the W H Smith High
Street stores. These were hit in the period by deflation in stationery
and greetings cards and face growing competition from other retailers
for its newspaper sales.
W H Smith intends to move the business away from its commodity focus
and concentrate on creating and serving new markets in education and
homeworking for example. It is the largest supplier of National
Curriculum literature. There are plans to open up to 50 smaller stores
in towns where it is currently not represented.
Elsewhere in the group, profits from distributing newspapers,
magazines and business supplies rose by almost 8%. Magazines offset a
decline in newspapers reflecting cuts in many cover prices.
However, W H Smith will make an extra #1m net profit on its News
International distribution contract following recent negotiations. For
the full year, the company should make pre-tax profits of around #129m
against #83.4m previously. Stronger growth is expected next year as the
benefits of new store openings and marketing initiatives feed through.
W H Smith shares dropped 7p to 430p.

SCOTTISH Friendly Assurance increased its overall sales by 22% last
year from #1.8m to #2.2m with single premium products up 13% and regular
premium sales 28% higher.
''In addition to a consistent performance from the sales force, a key
factor in the increase has been sales of our tax-exempt products, the
Scottish Bond and Child Bond,'' marketing manager Harry Gibb said
yesterday. Formerly known as City of Glasgow, Scottish is Scotland's

SCOTS businessmen were told yesterday to take advantage of
opportunities in one of the country's fastest growing sectors.
This advice was given by Scots entrepreneur David Sibbald, managing
director and founder of Atlantech Technologies.
He was speaking at a Dunbartonshire Enterprise Masterclass on the
emerging growth industry of information and multimedia. The event was
held at Caledonian University.
Mr Sibbald said: ''The information and multimedia industry is one of
the fastest growing in the world and is currently recording a 30% annual
growth rate.
''It is a relatively immature market which is bad news for the large
corporations but great news for entrepreneurs.''
He added: ''Use the local enterprise companies to help you get through
the quagmire of grants while providing any support you might need.''
One of the three speakers, Sam Docherty of Delphic Productions, said:
''Multimedia is the booming oil business of the 1990s. It has a real
wildcat feel to it.
''It is arguably the most effective form of communication in the
market today.''
Delegates also heard from Professor Ian Ritchie, Heriot-Watt
University, who is currently involved with the strategic use of IT
(Information Technology) in education and scholarship.
Professor Ritchie built up a multimedia business during the 1980s and
sold it to Panasonic in 1989.
He said: ''All over the world you will find Scots in top positions,
leading the way in the business world. Sadly it's somehow not the same
in their own country.
''Finding your market niche should be your goal. Build up an alliance
with major suppliers, and remember that your most valuable asset are
your customers.
''Think big, maintain a big company image but keep costs low. Only
spend your money where people will see it. You don't need flashy desks,
a #5 second-hand one will do just as well.''

THE fastest growing company in history with sales from zero to
$10,866m (#6950m) in just 12 years owes a considerable debt to its
Erskine plant on the Clyde. Compaq Computer Corporation made its first
investment in 1986 and so far has spent #86m on a state of the art
facility covering over a half million square feet.
Compaq's global sales growth in the last quarter slowed to 48%, while
earnings per share were below analysts expectations of 94cents at just
90cents.
Combined with the forecast that the current first quarter will show
flat sales and earnings, Compaq shares tumbled $7[5/8] in early dealings
to $34[3/4], dragging down the rest of the technology sector and
initially affecting Wall Street as a whole.
However, the flat sales expectation reflects the introduction of new
products in perhaps two weeks time and that the existing $2200m of
inventories will be reduced by aggressive pricing.
Last year, Erskine increased its sales by 37% to $2510m (#1600m) of
which $1990m (#1275m) were exported. Although the sales figures for 1994
from other major exporters are not yet available, it seems certain the
Compaq Manufacturing will glide effortlessly into the top ten of British
exporters from the 1993 position of 13th and 25th in 1992.
The workforce has increased by around 450 full time employees to 1210,
but there are also part timers which swell the number to over 2000, with
the plant currently working 168 hours a week.
As labour accounts for just 3% to 4% of the final production cost,
wage levels are not significant in selecting manufacturing sites --
rather it is the quality of the workforce.
Sales per Erskine employee rose $1m to $3.5m compared with the global
Compaq figure of $872,000, while profit margins were above the group
pre-tax average of 10.6% (8.6%).
Compaq has replaced IBM as world leader in personal computer sales
with a 53% increase in shipments to 4,800,000 units and from 8.1% to
10.3% in market share, whereas ''Big Blue'' saw a 6% fall to 3,960,000
units and from 10.8% to 8.5% share.
Greater market penetration was also seen by Apple which managed to
increase sales by 8% and now ranks equal with IBM. The most spectacular
growth, however, came from Packard Bell, up 101%, thanks, in part, to
the CD-ROMs sold by Dixons.
UK managing director Joe McNally said yesterday that prices had been
cut 15% to 30% on like-for-like products but the policy of upgrading
products meant that the average revenue per unit rose by 10%.
The company's meteoric growth has been due to its strategic decision
to go for market share at the expense of margins -- a gamble which so
far has paid off.
It is now stated company objective to have a market share twice that
of number two, which points to more pain for the competition as that
implies Compaq having about 18% of the PC sector.
President and chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said that group sales
had risen 51% while net income jumped 88% to $867m.
As usual, there is no dividend. No distribution has been made to
shareholders of the company which was founded after three ex-Texas
Instruments employees sat down in a cafe and drew a portable computer on
a napkin in 1982.
The European market is continuing to show strong growth, as is Japan.
Mr McNally believes the UK could grow by between 50% and 100% over the
next two or three years, with good sales to the increasing number of
people working from home and also from children demanding their own PC
with multi-media options.

AFTER some mighty swings of the axe last time the Scottish rugby
selectors never even cut out a comma yesterday. Their team to play
Ireland at Murrayfield a week on Saturday will be the same as the one
which defeated Canada -- even the replacements are unchanged.
Yet team-manager Duncan Paterson pointed out this was not complacency.
''We will have to improve if we are going to achieve victory over the
Irish,'' he said. ''The side has the capability to do that.''
He explained that his selectors had spent time discussing the format
of the back division: ''About twice as long as we took to choose the
forwards.''
Melrose wing Craig Joiner and outside centre Gregor Townsend of Gala
were likely to be the men most under debate. But without turning the
clock back and attempting to persuade Hawick's Tony Stanger to return to
the wing, there was no outstanding challenger to Joiner.
Scott Hastings, exile Ronnie Eriksson, Graham Shiel, and the
aforementioned Stanger were among those battling for a centre spot.
Townsend, however, has just returned from a long injury lay-off and it
would have been harsh to drop him so summarily.
The forwards were a racing cert to go in without any alteration. Prop
Alan Sharp, originally chosen againsts Canada, resumes for Bristol
against Leicester this Saturday, but the selectors do not consider he
has enough miles on his playing clock.
Bath's Andy Reed is coming up to see the SRU specialist about his back
problem -- four weeks is the estimate of his return -- while Northampton
flanker Peter Walton is testing a knee by some hill running. Next month
could be the earliest he will re-appear.
Paterson admitted he will await with interest the announcement of the
Irish team later this week. It looks as though the visitors will be
deprived of the services of their best lineout jumper, Neil Francis, who
has rib damage, which will certainly not help their cause.
They also have to decide whether to stick with new fly half Paul Burke
or revert to the more experienced Eric Elwood.
Team:
A G Hastings (Watsonians) captain; C A Joiner (Melrose), G P J
Townsend (Gala), I C Jardine, K M Logan (both Stirling County); C M
Chalmers, B W Redpath (both Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath), K S Milne
(Heriot's FP), P H Wright (Boroughmuir), D F Cronin (Bourges), S J
Campbell (Dundee High FP), R I Wainwright (West Hartlepool), E W Peters
(Bath), I R Morrison (London Scottish).
Replacements -- I C Glasgow (Heriot's FP), A G Shiel (Melrose), D W
Patterson (West Hartlepool), D S Munro (Glasgow High/Kelvinside), A P
Burnell (London Scottish), K D McKenzie (Stirling County).

Around 70 jobs and sales estimated at #8m have been created in the
food industry by a scheme backed by Scottish Enterprise.
The Food Product Development and Quality Management scheme gives food
technology graduates the opportunity to get one-year work placements
with Scottish food and drink companies and gain experience in the
different aspects of the food industry.
Last year, the 18 graduates participating in the scheme managed to
develop 55 food products -- including Mexican fish sticks and vegetarian
haggis -- and that success led companies involved to employ more staff
to cope with the demand.
Graduates also benefit. Last year 10 of the 18 graduates were employed
full time with their companies once the year's placement was over.
One of these, Ms Laura Hill, said: ''I have gained excellent knowledge
of the market place, our competitors, quality management, health and
safety, and customer service.''
Another, Ms Jayne Miller, also commended the scheme. ''Many graduates
are in a Catch-22 situation -- they can't get jobs without experience
but no-one is willing to let them get experience. This scheme fills that
gap by giving you a year of experience working with a very successful
company.''

THE fact that 10,000 people this week have become owners of Celtic is
enough to illustrate everything that the long, bitter battle for change,
which brought Fergus McCann to Parkhead, meant to the rank and file.
But the fact remains that the #4.5m over-subscribed to the share
issue, bringing it up to an astonishing #13.2m after costs, will be seen
by the great army who cannot afford a season ticket, let alone a piece
of the financial action, as cash that must be used to make the team
better.
The most successful share offer in British football will only please
the masses if the trophy room is bulging as impressively as the club
bank is collapsing under the weight of greenbacks.
As Hugh Nash, of stockbrokers Greig Middleton put it: ''The problem is
that we got too much money in.'' He was referring to the extra
subscription which amazed club officials, as it represented 1.8 times
the number of shares available.
The managing director, Fergus McCann, was not enthusiastic about
revealing the precise distribution of the extra funds when they are
acquired under the supplementary shares issue, but he knows that the
troops who fill the seats at Hampden will expect the bulk of the cash to
be used to buy players.
Manager Tommy Burns had been promised something like #4m to strengthen
the staff, and to date has used up #1.2m in the purchase Pierre van
Hooydonk.
His displays to date might well have had an influence in the
extraordinary late demand for shares but, whatever the reason, the new
situation will guarantee Burns popping his head round McCann's door and,
like Master Twist, ask for more.
The chances are that the reply will be more encouraging than was the
case for the original Olly, and my understanding is that the manager
will be given as much as #7m to stick in his back pocket as he scours
the Continent for stars.
But the club does face many other extra costs, in particular the
stadium which is due to have 34,000 seats by August.
The second phase of the new Parkhead will need borrowed money to
finance but the sound foundation guaranteed by the share issue will
allow McCann and his board to pay a visit to the bank in less humble
fashion than might have been the case.
But McCann was careful not to commit himself publicly to a major new
contribution to Burns' transfer purse. ''The fans will assume that we
will handle the money properly, and it could very well be the case that
the funding will be used to meet the requirements of the needs that
Tommy Burns identifies.
''But they will also know that we have to have better facilities. It
is a concern that we will only have 34,00 seats next year.''
What Parkhead fans want to hear most is that Celtic are now heading
into the same financial ball park as Rangers. McCann would only say:
''There have been a lot of things missing in the last few years, but now
we see no reason why we cannot compete, not only with Rangers, but with
any big club in Britain.''
The chief executive, whose holding will drop to 50% as a result of the
extra demand, would appear to be on course to make a profit in the five
years he declared would be his tenure as chief shareholder, and must
privately be elated by the progress he has made in 10 months.
McCann would find few detractors among the faithful when he claims
that the happenings of this week mark a significant change in the
history of the club. ''We now have 10,000 people who know they have a
share in this club, aside from the fact that they have put money to help
the club's expansion.''
All of this will provide plenty of discussion in the bars and by-ways
of the game, but the proletariat will be more motivated by guessing who
could be in the minds of Burns and his assistant, Billy Stark, as they
take upon themselves the biggest spending burden ever laid on a Parkhead
management's shoulders.
If we can join in the fun and allow our imaginations to wander, it is
possible to suggest some star turns that are within this exciting new
budget available to Celtic. For instance, Denis Bergkamp, generally
recognised as the most exciting Dutch striker since Marco van Basten and
Ruud Gullit, could be bought for the money now sitting restlessly in the
Burns biscuit tin. He is available a #6.1m but the snag might be the
great man's pay poke which, with Inter-Milan, amounts to more than #1m a
year.
Denis alongside van Hooydonk does have a special appeal but, more
realistically, another Dutch forward who plays the kind of game which
would marry well with van Hooydonk is on offer. Uri Moelder, the
23-year-old with Schalke O4 in Germany, is unsettled and fancies a move,
and he is made of the kind of stuff which could survive well in the
Scottish game.
Michael Mols, of Twente Enschede, has been watched by Celtic and the
Dutch think he would be an ideal foil for his compatriot, but Burns also
has had good reports of Nigerian World Cup man Augustine Okocha.
Word has it, too, that Celtic have been impressed by a player seen in
Spain, but nearer to home, Neil McCann, of Dundee, is likely to join the
nouveau riche in the east-end of Glasgow by the end of the season. And
Mark Hughes, who will surely be leaving Manchester United in due course,
is bound to be considered.
Gordan Petric, of Dundee United, is the kind of player Celtic fans
would appreciate, too, but what is important is what Burns and Stark
believe is the way forward.
What they seem certain to do is to buy another major player to bolster
the second half of the season efforts.
There are now 10,000 card-holding voters who want to see something new
in the trophy room soon. They have put their money where their hearts
are. No football club could ask for more.
* WINGER Mickey Weir yesterday brought an end to his contract dispute
with Hibernian by signing a new two-year deal with the Easter Road club.
JOHN Brogan, formerly with Stirling Albion, has been appointed manager
of Arbroath in succession to the recently sacked George Mackie.

ONE year on from a successful management buy-out, Prime Meat of
Inverurie announced yesterday it had more than matched financial and
jobs targets.
Prime Meat is a north-east Scotch beef wholesaling operation. The
three-man MBO team will notch up their first financial year this weekend
when a planned doubling of turnover of #8m will be recorded.
Also, Prime Meat's business plan included an increase in jobs from six
to 26 and butchery director Iain McKinnon reported that the workforce
currently stood at 29.
He said: ''We have more than matched our 12-month-old expectations and
we now have a truly UK-wide market with business really picking up in
recent months.''
Mr McKinnon added that the first-year results augured well for the
future of Prime Meat which also supplies countries abroad, including the
lucrative Dutch market.
Other buy-out team members are Graham Milne, managing director, and
procurement director William Reid. The team has substantially increased
a customer base of retail outlets from Aberdeen to London.
Formerly Alsop of Aberdeen, the firm has settled into a 10,000 sq ft
beef boning and processing plant on the Blackhall industrial estate at
Inverurie.
Unusually for an MBO, the three directors have used their own
resources to achieve the buy-out with each owning a third of the
business.
As the firm enters the second year of operations, Prime Meat plans to
further raise its profile and widen domestic and foreign markets.

A CLOUD hangs over the career of Manchester United's Eric Cantona
following outrageous scenes at Selhurst Park where Alex Ferguson's team
drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace last night.
The Frenchman and his team-mate Paul Ince face severe sanctions after
they became involved in the mini-riot following the dismissal of Cantona
after 48 minutes.
Both players went flailing in among Palace supporters and were
interviewed by the police but later allowed to go home.
And to add to United's worries, the result cost them the chance to
overhaul Blackburn Rovers at the top of the Premiership.
Cantona has courted disaster for a long time with his niggles and his
sly kicks. But his world exploded just after half-time when Palace's
Richard Shaw tackled him from behind. The Frenchman lashed out with his
right foot and caught the Palace defender, right under the nose of
Chester-le-Street referee Alan Wilkie.
As United players surrounded the official, he pulled out the red card
and pointed Cantona, arms outstretched in innocent supplication, to the
dressing-room.
The home fans taunted him as he made his lonely way down the touchline
and one gestured obscenely. Before anyone could restrain Cantona, he
leapt the perimeter fence and launched himself into a two-footed lunge
at the supporter.
Ince led the charge of United players in support of Cantona and is
alleged to have struck two fans before police and stewards restored
order.
Cantona had tea thrown over him as United keeper Peter Schmeichel came
over to escort him to the dressing-room, where police allowed him to
shower and dress before taking him to the local station.
The fan involved in the first instance was taken away by the police to
be interviewed.
It is the fifth time Cantona has been sent off in United colours since
his #1m move from Leeds, where he won the first of his three
championship medals.
He earned a four-match European ban for calling the referee a cheat at
the end of United's exit against Galatasaray in Turkey last season, and
a five-match ban for being sent off in consecutive matches at Swindon
and Arsenal. He then missed three of this term's early games after a
pre-season dismissal against QPR.
Cantona had been out of sorts all night, his passes going astray as
United attempted to build on the recent win over leaders Blackburn by
going a point clear of them, though from having played two games more.
Ironically, the dismissal fired United and they took the lead with
David May's first Premiership goal since his #1.4m move from Blackburn.
Lee Sharpe ran on to a Gary Pallister short free-kick, and his back-post
cross was well met by the big defender, standing in for the suspended
Steve Bruce.
Andy Cole, asked to perform heroics in the absence of his partner,
went clear in 66 minutes, racing away from Chris Coleman to set up what
should have been his first goal since his #7m move from Newcastle, but
with Nigel Martyn racing out, the striker hooked his shot wide.
Then United's resolve ebbed and in 79 minutes their defence collapsed
in a goalmouth melee, allowing Gareth Southgate to net the equaliser.
The match was almost an irrelevance after what had gone on, and as the
players left the field, the police moved in to begin taking statements.
In Birmingham, Tottenham manager Gerry Francis said little about the
match referee after he had failed to send off Aston Villa keeper Mark
Bosnich for a challenge which left Spurs' Jurgen Klinsmann nursing a
suspected broken nose in Villa's 1-0 win.
Video evidence showed Bosnich guilty of a reckless high challenge that
left Klinsmann flat out after 21 minutes. ''Jurgen was brave going for
the ball,'' said Francis, ''and he's now got a terrible headache and his
nose may be broken. But I can't hammer the referee because I haven't
seen it on video yet.''
Another referee was the centre of attraction, this time at Norwich,
where Philip Don lasted just 45 minutes in the match against Coventry,
but that was long enough to upset visiting manager Phil Neal.
Don, who pulled a muscle in a leg late in the first half, infuriated
Coventry when he awarded the home side a penalty after 32 minutes.
Neal said after the 2-2 draw: ''We do not seem to be getting the rub
of the green as far as referees are concerned. The same thing happened
when we played Manchester United when Gary Pallister handled in the box
and the referee waved play on.'' But at Newcastle, Wimbledon manager Joe
Kinnear put it much stronger when he called referee Mike Reed ''a
cheat.'' Kinnear was incensed when the official disallowed a late goal,
a decision which gave United a 2-1 win.
''I have called the referee a cheat and I'm aware I could be in
trouble, but they have to be told,'' said Kinnear.

THREE men with severe disabilities are pioneering the success of a
Fife company whose products are small, but are making a big impact on
the Scottish furniture market.
Brendan Reid, Iain Bentley, and James Laing have taken advantage of
special training schemes and advice, along with grant aid provided by
Fife Regional Council and Community Business Fife, to establish a
thriving children's furniture business.
Miniature tables, chairs and desks for little people are being
manufactured by their company, Rainbow Crafts, attracting orders across
the country, with interest now being shown by suppliers further afield.
The council says it considers the venture one of the real success
stories emerging from its drive to help the disadvantaged compete in the
jobs market.
Mr Reid, a 47 year-old trained plumber never fully recovered after
falling into a trench and damaging his back 20 years ago. He was forced
to retire in 1987, but went on to take a small business studies course
learning computer technology, book keeping and mangement skills -- where
he met his fellow directors.
They decided to set up their own business, aimed at the early learning
market, initially producing children's jigsaws from workshops in
Glenrothes.
Rainbow has now moved to bigger premises at Crosshill, where it
allowed Brendan, Iain, who has celebral palsy, and James, who has
multiple sclerosis, to develop their range of furniture.
Said Brendan: ''This is a completely different type of challenge. We
are very grateful that the training project has given me, and others
with disabilities, the opportunity to work again.''

CALIFORNIA Cake &amp; Cookie has bought one of its Scottish rivals, Cake &amp;
Co, for an undisclosed six-figure sum and will integrate the two bakery
operations, writes COLIN McSEVENY.
The Govan-based company, set up by Californian Debra Peterson 16 years
ago and specialising in a range of American-style cakes, purchased the
Bellshill company from Top Hat Holdings.
The takeover is a sign that California, which won a celebrated legal
battle to use Millionaire Shortbread as a registered trademark, is well
on the road to recovery after a refinancing crisis last year.
''Sales are going very well and the integration of Cake &amp; Co, which
will give us another, broader-based brand name, should easily boost our
turnover to more than #3m,'' Ms Peterson said yesterday.
Like Cake &amp; Co, the Glasgow company not only makes a range of cakes
under its own name, but also supplies own-label products to catering and
retail customers like Safeway, Wm Low, Intercity Trains and British
Airways.
Cake &amp; Co's operations will gradually be shifted to California's main
plant and redundancies look likely.
''We are still discussing the possible job impact though I would
stress that as well as taking over the Cake &amp; Co brands, we are also
keen to keep as many of their employees as possible,'' she added.

Frankfurt, Wednesday -- The DAX index of leading shares remains on a
rollercoaster ride and ended today's bourse trading up but off intra-day
gains. The 30-share index closed up 8.80 at 2026.84 below the high at
2035.51.
The market corrected in early trading after having sold off too
aggressively in pre-bourse trading. Selling was mostly limited to the
large German automobile companies where losses helped pull the entire
index lower.
US funds began selling BMW, Volkswagen, and Daimler-Benz shares after
analysing American car maker figures which seemed slightly more
positive.
If funds selling continue, the index could quickly reach the key 2000
level.
* Paris -- Shares ended higher in moderate volume in mainly technical
trading in a rebound to sharp losses incurred earlier this week and
despite a mixed performance on Wall Street.
The CAC-40 index rose 22.29 to 1802.46.
* Tokyo -- Stocks closed higher as stock indices were strongly
supported by firmness in many construction firms' shares.
But the Nikkei ended off earlier highs as profit-taking in the late
afternoon eroded some earlier gains. Purchases of construction shares
were mainly by individual investors and dealers.
The Nikkei gained 98.75 at 18,159.48 after rising as high as
18,412.61. The broader Topix index was up 15.73 at 1426.03. The Nikkei
300 ended up 2.41 at 260.98.
* Hong Kong -- Shares ended sharply higher in a technical rebound,
helped by better than expected government land auction results.
The blue-chip Hang Seng index surged 217.82 to close at 7240.72.

AARON Krickstein ground out a four-set victory over Dutchman Jacco
Eltingh at the Australian Open Tennis Championships in Melbourne
yesterday to make it an all-American line-up at the semi-finals stage of
a Grand Slam event for the first time since 1979.
The unseeded Krickstein, ranked forty-fifth in the world, quietly
despatched Eltingh 7-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 after Andre Agassi had given a
breathtaking display of fire and wizardry in a three-set destruction of
Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
Krickstein now faces the Agassi while Michael Chang plays world No.1
Pete Sampras, who won an emotion-charged five-set epic on Tuesday night
against another American, Jim Courier.
It was nearly 16 years ago, at the US Open, when four Americans --
Vitas Gerulaitis, Roscoe Tanner, John McEnroe, and Jimmy Connors -- last
filled all four berths in a Grand Slam semi-final.
Krickstein, who had beaten sixth seed Stefan Edberg in the previous
round, was more reliable on his serve and far too quick about the court
for Eltingh.
But Krickstein, who has been in the top 50 for seven successive years,
admitted he was not relishing the prospect of facing a pumped-up Agassi.
''He's steam-rollered everyone, I have just got to give it my best shot
. . . he's hitting the ball from the ground better than anyone else in
the world at the moment,'' he said.
The world No.2, aiming for a second consecutive Grand Slam title, gave
a near-flawless exhibition of baseline play to outclass Kafelnikov 6-2,
7-5, 6-0 in 83 minutes -- and has still not dropped a set.
It is 24 years since Ken Rosewall became the last man to win the
Australian Open without dropping a set and 15 years since Bjorn Bjorg
became the last Grand Slam champion to achieve the feat, at the 1980
French Open. Agassi still has two matches to go, but he is playing with
the sort of confidence that leaves no room for argument.
Kafelnikov, who tossed away his racket early in the third set in mock
despair at Agassi's brilliance and made to walk away to the dressing
room, was as impressed as anyone -- ''He's really on fire . . . his
ground strokes were unbelievable.''
The semi-final line-up in the women's singles was completed earlier in
the day, when America's Marianne Werdel Witmeyer, at No.47, became the
lowest-ranked woman to reach the last four at Flinders Park for five
years.
Witmeyer comfortably beat Mexico's Angelica Gavaldon 6-1, 6-2 in 55
minutes, but must now face top seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain.
Sanchez Vicario, who will be installed as the new world No.1 if she wins
the Australian title, disposed of Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu, her fifth
successive unseeded opponent, 6-1, 6-3 and has dropped only 18 games so
far.

You may never have heard
of a hogring but, says
Grace Franklin, it is the
basis of one remarkable
woman's success
AREMARKABLE woman in Rutherglen has quietly hog-tied the nation with
something called a hogring. The generic name for a fastener which is
used to join wire to wire or material to wire, a hogring staples
together anything from bedsprings to car seats, from fencing to animal
breeding cages. Hogrings are only noticeable when they are absent.
Without them, the nation falls apart.
Since 1896 J &amp; H Rosenheim of Quay Road, Rutherglen has been supplying
industrial staples to every kind of industry in the UK and abroad.
But last year managing director Gaye B Rose took her company into
manufacturing in a big way. Now it produces hogrings from big to small,
from sharp to blunt, from copper to galvanised finish, and specialist
rings used in fencing.
''This is a very exciting time for us,'' says Mrs Rose in her elegant
office. ''We are the only company in the UK manufacturing hogrings and
we carry the whole range.''
Her unique place in history has caught competitors unaware. But they
have been gallant enough to offer their congratulations on her
achievement.
Mrs Rose expects to double production in the next 12 months. ''The
idea of manufacturing our own hogrings germinated in the sterling crash
of September 92,'' she explains.
The major supply to the UK was priced in deutschmarks, so British
industry suddenly faced an overnight increase of 25% on vital materials.
''It soon became clear that if we could manufacture what our customers
required, here in Scotland, they would benefit as future currency
fluctuations wouldn't affect them.''
Customers could buy in quantities to suit their just-in-time
production schedules, rather than the fixed bulk orders required by
overseas suppliers. By buying in Britain, customers would also avoid
problems such as dock strikes disrupting production.
''We can -- and do -- produce to specification and we have turned
around hogrings to a customer's specification within 24 hours,'' says
Mrs Rose proudly. She considers the success of her manufacturing wing is
due to the high standards she has insisted on from the very beginning.
''I admit it was tough to take the decision to extend our
manufacturing capability,'' she says.
''It was a big step for us to take, particularly after the bad
recession years we had all experienced in industry. We had to scour the
world to find the best production machines.
''They came with no manuals and it took three or four months for us to
assemble them and set up a production line. We had to find and train
engineers who had heard of hogrings and could modify the tooling to our
specific requirements. Then we had to train operators to produce to our
high standards.''
The modifications were particularly necessary as the company makes a
universal hogring to fit all brands of tools. ''You get only one chance
at a market,'' says Mrs Rose, ''so we had to ensure our product was
equal to, if not better than, the best previously available.
''I'm happy to say we achieved this and we are continually developing
and improving every day.'' Now there is scarcely an industry the company
doesn't supply and Mrs Rose is confident her new manufacturing product
will do well in the export markets.
''I am looking forward to the challenge of this export market in the
very near future,'' said Mrs Rose. ''My late husband Monty was the first
to introduce pneumatic fastening systems to the UK and I am dedicating
my exporting efforts to his memory.''
She took over the running of the company when her husband died four
years ago. She had travelled abroad with him as his interpreter on
business trips.
Speaking fluent Spanish, French, and Italian and with enough
Portuguese, Russian and Mandarin to get by, you can be sure that Gaye
Rose will have the words to hogtie any deal around the world and staple
the order firmly to her company's books.

A revolution in contact-lens
manufacture lands
the first award of 1995
AN idea originally tested in a back garden laboratory has sparked a
revolution in contact lens production.
The new concept, claimed to be the world's most advanced in contact
lens manufacture, is the brainchild of inventors Ron Hamilton and Bill
Seden, founders of Livingston-based Award plc, who managed to raise an
initial #1.5m to set the project in motion in the late 1980s. Their
innovation has also landed them the first TrailBlazers award of 1995.
Hamilton, managing director, and Seden, technical director, have
produced the first high water content daily-wear/daily-disposable
contact lens which has recently gone on sale UK-wide through Boots
Opticians and other selected independent opticians.
With the lenses being disposed of daily, the wearer has no need for
all the associated cleaning solutions, and this represents a
particularly attractive proposition to regular travellers, the military,
and sports men and women.
The route from back garden to Boots, via a small manufacturing unit in
Kirkton Campus, has not been quick or easy: Hamilton and Seden first
began developing the idea in 1988. After filing a UK patent application
they realised they would not be able to meet the costs of the
international patent protection, and that they had to work fast to raise
funding.
''Before the patent application expired, we went to the British
Technology Group who agreed to safeguard an extensive patent portfolio
as well as part-funding a proof-of-concept laboratory to ensure
viability of the idea,'' says Hamilton. This laboratory was set up in
the back garden of Ron's home, then in Southampton.
Having drawn blanks from venture capitalists in England, they had to
look to Scotland and Wales before achieving regional assistance. Boots
believed in the concept enough to supply letters of recommendation to
encourage additional investors, which now include Scottish Enterprise
and British Coal Enterprise.
''Boots' role was essential and is a good example of a high profile
retailer giving moral support to the development of a new company'',
adds Ron. Indeed, Award went on to sign a #2.5m supply agreement with
Boots Opticians.
So the time came for Award to begin production, and Bill Seden took a
closer look at existing methods of manufacture.
''Existing contact lens manufacturing technologies are fairly labour
intensive, resulting in high lens costs,'' he says. ''Wearers also have
to buy a variety of solutions to clean and disinfect the lenses every
day. This is expensive and the subsequent constant handling can cause
damage to the lens surface.''
Award addressed the issue of high unit costs by applying the
directors' collective experience of technology used in the manufacture
of pharmaceutical products to the processing of contact lenses. Seden
explains: ''We inject liquid plastic monomer into specially designed
moulds. These moulds, plus the lens, are encased in the final foil pack
with saline solution, so throughout the whole process the lenses are
untouched by human hands. This is a very labour efficient process which
means high volumes and low unit costs.''
The team was strengthened by the appointment of David Phillips as
financial director. ''David has ensured that our management planning and
control systems are as efficient as the manufacturing process,'' says
Ron Hamilton.
With distribution another vital link in the success chain, Award
pulled in the services of neighbouring firm McColl McGregor, who first
contacted the company after reading an article about it in the local
paper. ''They now handle all our customer order processing,'' says
Hamilton.
The initial success of the company has been mirrored by the fact that
original customers are already selling 80 times as many lenses as
originally forecast. As a result Award has had to accelerate its
business plan accordingly, with the present goal to install 10
production lines generating sales with a retail value of over #100m by
1998. This should expand the workforce of the company to over 300.
Ron Hamilton remains confident that the company's disposable lenses
represent a new and potentially huge segment of the vision-care market.
''A relatively small proportion of existing users adopting our lenses
will generate demand exceeding #2bn per annum,'' he claims. ''The key to
tapping this market is stable, low-cost manufacturing technology and we
believe we are unqiquely placed to benefit from the application of its
technology, both in the UK and worldwide.''
Like most other manufacturing companies in the UK, Award now has its
sights set on the European market and its plans to launch Euro-Opticians
Direct, a system capable of handling orders direct from any optical
outlet across Europe with overnight dispatch, are just the beginnings of
its own particular vision for the future.

IN all the sound and fury surrounding the salaries of some British
chief executives in industry and commerce, little or no exception seems
to have been taken at the likelihood that the earning power of quite a
few people who do nothing more important than play a game rather better
than most might leave those with responsibility as well as power nursing
a grievance.
The educated guess, for example, is that Andy Cole, recently
transferred from Newcastle to Manchester United for #7m, is on the thick
end of #10,000 a week, and the world's leading tennis players and
athletes annually rake in a fortune. Now figures just released show that
professional golfers at all levels of the game are similarly rewarded.
Record sums for 1994 were set -- the South African Ernie Els leading
the men with $2,862,854; the American Raymond Floyd the seniors with
$1,632,779; and England's Laura Davies the women with $1,006,143. The
figures are contained in Mark McCormack's 1995 edition of the The World
of Professional Golf, to be published in April.
Els, who won the US Open and four other tournaments -- only events
decided over at least 36 holes and with a minimum of four players
counted, excluding such ''junk golf'' as skins games -- finished well
ahead of Nick Price, $447,390 behind, despite having had seven
victories, including the Open and US PGA Championships.
Jumbo Ozaki, Jose Maria Olazabal, Greg Norman, and Nick Faldo also
earned more than $2m, and Fred Couples and Europe's No.1, Colin
Montgomerie, first and second in Dubai only last weekend, led the 18
players who won more than $1m, with $1,859,689 and $1,739,349
respectively.
Floyd's total exceeded the previous record, set by Lee Trevino in
1990, by $321,748, and altogether seven senior golfers earned more than
$1m each last season. Even Tony Jacklin took $226,551 from the most
phenomenal sports growth of the last two decades although he did not
start the US Tour until well into the year.
Davies, who became the first woman to break the $1m barrier, had eight
victories world-wide, three in the United States, two in Europe, and one
each in Asia, Japan, and Australia. Davies beat comfortably into second
place Beth Daniel, whose 1990 record of $963,578 she broke. Two other
Europeans, the Swedes Liselotte Neumann (fourth) and Helen Alfredsson
(fourteenth), finished in the first 15 places.

MARKSMAN Chris Palmer thought his chance of ice hockey glory with Team
Canada had vanished when he reluctantly turned his back on them earlier
this year, opting instead to earn his living in Switzerland.
The 27-year-old was then transferred to his old stomping ground at
Edinburgh Racers, content to dedicate himself to helping the capital
combine re-establish themselves in the top flight. But last night
Palmer's world was turned upside down when he received a telephone call
asking him to join Team Canada on their four-game British tour.
He was immediatly granted permission by Edinburgh Racers -- with the
proviso that he is available for a vital Premier Division match with
arch-rivals Fife Flyers at Kirkcaldy on Saturday and a home league game
with Milton Keynes Kings 24 hours later.
Palmer aims to impress in challenge games at Peterborough Pirates
tomorrow, Milton Keynes on Monday, and against a Scottish All Stars side
at Paisley on Tuesday.
Since joining the Edinburgh side in the autumn, Palmer has bagged 35
goals and set up 49 others in 18 games for Racers.

ONE of the rebel Tories without the party Whip claimed yesterday that
their ideas would appear in the next Conservative manifesto.
Mrs Teresa Gorman and seven others who had the Whip withdrawn went to
Lowestoft, Suffolk, to meet fishermen, who fear the impact of the latest
EU deal on fishing.
Mrs Gorman, MP for Billericay, said: ''We are the vanguard of many
policies which we want the party to adopt. We have the support of the
rank and file, our postbags tell us that, and we believe we are
launching many ideas which will be in our next manifesto.''
She said the fishing industry was being destroyed because of the
Common Fisheries Policy.
''We want to get that back for British fishermen. We want jobs in
Britain -- not Spain, not Greece, no Italy, but here.
''These people had a thriving industry here. It's all disappearing and
we're going to rescue it. We have to reclaim the right of British
fishermen to fish exclusively in British waters.
''Not a drop of British water belongs to Britain now. We want to
reverse that.''
She said ''lots and lots of back benchers'' supported her group's
visit to Lowestoft.
The high-profile visit by the Tory rebels shows that the Prime
Minister's efforts to get them restored to the party Whip are having no
effect at the moment.
The MPs seem prepared to remain exiles from the party for the present,
because they feel their actions are causing a shift in Government
attitudes to the European Union.
Apart from Mrs Gorman, the MPs who visited Lowestoft yesterday were
Sir Richard Body, Sir Teddy Taylor, Richard Shepherd, Michael Carttiss,
Nicholas Budgen, Tony Marlow and Christopher Gill.

THE much-needed rationalisation of the DIY market in the UK will take
place following yesterday's confirmation from Sainsbury that it is to
take Texas Homecare off Ladbroke's hands and merge it with its smaller
Homebase DIY and garden centre business.
Rival DIY companies were quick to welcome the deal. Jeremy Hardie,
chairman of W H Smith, said that two positive factors arising from the
takeover were the reduction in capacity within the DIY industry and the
removal of price-cutting Texas. This provides scope for all the
remaining operators to raise their margins and thereby profitability
should they so wish.
The introduction into Texas Homecare of Sainsbury's superior systems
and products -- aimed at the softer decorative end of the DIY market --
should result in a significant improvement in the profitability of the
Texas business. However, Texas is not expected to make a significant
contribution to Sainsbury's earnings in the current financial year to
March 1996.
Kingfisher, which still remains the UK's largest DIY retailer after
the Sainsbury deal with around 15% share, is confident that it can
continue to give the newly-enlarged Homebase a run for its money.
Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher's director of corporate affairs, said that
he was ''confident that B&amp;Q will continue to shine as the market leader
for the foreseeable future''.
The structure of the B&amp;Q business itself is currently the subject of
an internal review at Kingfisher. This is expected to result in the
closure of some of the smaller outlets in favour of large warehouse
stores of around 100,000 sq ft. It currently has 14 warehouse stores and
would like to increase this to 50.
Yesterday's deal is unlikely to be the last we hear from the DIY
sector. A further shakeout in the industry is likely to follow the
arrival on these shores of Home Depot from the US. Home Depot is the
leader in the US home improvement market with about 8% market share. B&amp;Q
is closely modelled on the Home Depot trading concept.
While Wickes has a profitable niche, the long-term independent future
of Great Mills, a non-core part of the building materials group RMC,
must be in some doubt. The smaller chains of Homebase and Wickes have
routinely outperformed their larger rivals in financial terms. The
Wickes' DIY format has delivered over 20% per annum profit growth
through the recession and the price war which decimated profits at Texas
and Do-It-All.
As long as the UK housing market remains sluggish then pressure will
be on home improvement companies to get their own houses in order.
Wickes, with its emphasis on the ''heavy'' end of the home improvement
market, is well placed to benefit from steady if unspectacular future
growth in demand for DIY products.
The City welcomed the Sainsbury/Texas deal together with a strong
Christmas trading statement from Sainsbury. In the first 16 weeks of the
second half, underlying sales growth in Sainsbury's supermarkets was
2.2% although in December this rose to 5.5%.
In Homebase underlying sales rose by 5.3%. The clothing sales in the
Savacentre hypermarkets were hit by the mild winter weather before
Christmas. Sainsbury said it is on course for ''a satisfactory'' result
for the year and a strong development programme next year.
Sainsbury shares gained 5p to 418p.

NICK Faldo embarks today upon the second of his 20 or so tournaments
in America this season, in the Phoenix Open on the par-71, 6992-yard
''Stadium'' course in Arizona. It is out in the desert beyond
Scottsdale, where wind and rain, which is forecast, can play havoc with
the cards of the finest professionals.
This is where Sandy Lyle, Faldo's former Ryder Cup team-mate, won a
memorable victory in 1988, beating Fred Couples in a play-off after the
American obligingly had twice driven into the lake at the eighteenth.
How things have changed since then, with Couples going from strength
to strength whereas Lyle is struggling to get back into Europe's side
for the first time since 1987.
Faldo -- who ignored Tuesday's ''shoot-out'', won by Curtis Strange,
and long-driving competition, won by John Daly with 336 yards --
yesterday partnered former basketball star Michael Jordan in the pro-am,
when 40,000 spectators turned up.
The former Open champion tees off very late in the tournament proper
today, along with Paul Azinger and Howard Twitty.

Manila
COLIN Montgomerie summoned up the courage to sample another slice of
the high life golfing success brings in the nineties with a helicopter
ride to the scene of what he hopes will be his first victory of the new
season in the Johnnie Walker Classic.
It took only eight minutes for him and fellow passenger Greg Norman,
who is contemplating buying his own 'chopper' to go with his Gulf Stream
jet, arguing that ''it's a business tool,'' to be ferried from their
downtown hotel over seething Manila with its 12m population to the
palatial new Orchard Club.
The #8m clubhouse comes complete with theatre, cinema, Olympic-sized
pool, and ballroom, while outside tennis, squash and even pelota courts
sprawl over 15,000 square metres the full length of the par-5 eighteenth
fairway.
Hitherto no fan of helicopters, the 31-year-old Scot, who
superstitiously always strives to secure seat 1A on passenger planes,
admitted: ''I don't like the way they go up and down in air currents,
but I decided it was preferable after enduring an hour-long ride through
the traffic jams.''
He has been demoted from the No.1 berth he occupied in the order of
merit at the end of the last two seasons by American Fred Couples, who
beat him into second place in the Desert Classic on Sunday, having
benefited from a European Tour decision to include non-members, but the
Scot firmly believes he can be back on top come Sunday night.
A #100,000 victory this week for Montgomerie -- who generously donated
his $10,000 winner's cheque in the Texas Scramble to President Fidel
Ramos's Green and Clean campaign for the 7000 islands of the Philippines
-- would also nudge his Ryder Cup-counting winnings to more than
#280,000 and virtually guarantee his seat on Concorde in September.
With Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Montgomerie, Jose Maria
Olazabal and Ian Woosnam currently occupying the top five places in the
table, the Scot is pleased with the way the team is shaping up: ''It's
important with Bernard Gallacher having virtually just one pick. That
will have to be Nick Faldo, who's playing in America this year, unless
he wins a couple of majors.
''I strongly favour a system by which the whole team was selected, as
happens in football, cricket and rugby. It's important to have your
strongest team, rather than reward someone for playing in 35
tournaments. Our victories in 1985 and 1987 made the European Tour and
it's vital that we win back the cup.''
Captain Gallacher backs the present method of Cup qualifying: ''If
many more followed Faldo on to the American circuit we might have to
reassess matters, but it with big money events on top quality courses
towards the end of the year included and points now available in the
American majors it's the right balance. It wasn't only the cup wins of
'85 and '87 that made the Tour, it also was European victories in the
majors.''
Norman would dearly like to retain his Johnnie Walker title as he
approaches his fortieth birthday on February 10, just to prove he is
will be a major force in the season ahead. ''In 1990 I embarked on a
programme aimed at making me fitter and stronger,'' said Norman. ''Jack
Nicklaus wishes he had started working on his fitness in his 30s instead
of his late 40s.
''I believe if you are fit you can go on competing at the highest
level until you're 55 or 57. Raymond Floyd is 52 and, although outwardly
not that fit, he's a very healthy speciman inside and swinging as well
as ever.''
Montgomerie, who partners world No.1 Nick Price in the first two
rounds, starts among the favourites with Norman, Couples and Ernie Els,
and other Scots in the field include Sam Torrance, Andrew Coltart, Gary
Orr, Adam Hunter and Ross Drummond, all non-qualifiers in Dubai.

SOMETHING and someone was missing from Scottish Question Time
yesterday.
The spirit of Rabbie certainly turned up, and no doubt he enjoyed the
poetic missiles as his verse was misquoted.
The something that is missing is power -- the electricity which
charges Prime Minister's Question Time is entirely absent from the
second-rate Scottish production.
This does not mean the cast are second-rate, although some undoubtedly
are. However, without the buzz of adrenalin that comes from proximity to
real decision making, Scottish Questions and the Scottish Grand
Committee resemble end of season football fixtures -- a collection of
players going through the motions of parliamentary debate.
The someone who was missing was any Scottish Law Officer. The present
Solicitor General, Mr Thomas Dawson, isn't a parliamentarian of any kind
whether elected or appointed.
Thus, with the Lord Advocate safely out of harm's way in the Lords,
there is no direct access in Common's Question Time to the Scottish Law
Officers.
For example, yesterday's Scottish Questions should have been
dominatedby detailed questioning of the Law Officers on the claims of an
Iranian connection to the Lockerbie investigation.
However, because the Law Officers are not present, not a single legal
question had been placed on the order paper by the deadline a fortnight
ago and so there was no chance to pursue this vital matter even by proxy
to another Minister.
Nor will the revamped procedures on the Scottish Grand Committee make
any difference. Although Ministers from the Lords can be questioned by
MPs this is only to occur when they choose to make a statement.
The most persistent questioner of the Government on the Lockerbie
investigation has been the indefatigable Tam Dalyell.
However, even the substantial parliamentary ingenuity of the Laird of
the Binns has not been able to tempt out the Law Officers to say whether
they had access to US Air Force files on the Iranian connection before
pushing their case against the Libyan suspects.
The nearest he came was forcing an adjournment debate at the Scottish
Grand Committee last month where Lord James Douglas-Hamilton was given
the task of stonewalling for the Government.
The Hansard record of the end of this debate offers a revealing
insight into how unsatisfactory it is to attempt parliamentary enquiry
by proxy.
Lord James: ''It is mischievous to suggest that my noble and learned
friend the Lord Advocate's departments have given anything less than
total commitment to this case, in accordance with established
procedures.''
Mr Dalyell:  ''Rubbish.''
Hardly a meeting of minds on the Grand Committee and more importantly
an abuse of democracy when an elected representative is effectively
prevented from direct questioning to ascertain the truth.
The points at issue here are substantial. I haven't the slightest idea
if the information from the US Air Force files has any degree of
validity.
What I do know is that the Lockerbie relatives and the people of
Scotland are entitled to answers to the very real doubts emerging about
the nature of the information and evidence provided, or not provided, to
the Law Officers of Scotland.
At worst it could be, as  Tam Dalyell evidently believes, that the
Scottish legal system has been used as a cover for some wider and
dirtier political and diplomatic game.
There is a substantial irony here for Tam personally. He currently
divides his time between pursuing the case for a proper inquiry into the
circumstances of Lockerbie and pursuing the case against any change in
the British constitution.
And yet it is that very parliamentary system which is denying Tam the
ability to satisfactorily pursue the responsible Ministers. Just what is
it about British democracy that Tam finds so appealing.
I don't know whether this penny will ever drop with Tam. If it does
then prepare for a conversion which will make the road to Damascus seem
like mild change of emphasis.
If it doesn't then Tam will richly deserve the  fate specially
reserved for him by Rabbie:
Ah Tam! Ah Tam! thou'll get thy fairin!
In Hell they'll roast thee like a herrin!

JANUARY is the cruellest month, not least for hapless postmen obliged
to cart several hundredweights of holiday brochures around of a morning.
We don't say such literature leans towards blind optimism, but we do
note that in providing the introduction to the Scottish Tourist Board's
1995 holiday guide weatherman Ian McAskill alleges that Scotland is ''an
all-seasons destination''.
Yes, that Scotland. May and June are ''great months for Scottish
tourism'', says the weather guru, apparently because the rhododendrons
are out, even when the sun's in. ''Or autumn. Ever seen Royal Deeside or
Perthshire in late October?''
We have, as it happens, in all their drizzling glory, and that may be
the STB's biggest problem. Nevertheless, its range of glossy booklets
leaves no nook, cranny, castle, or bijou Hielan' hame of this fair land
unexplored. Take the press release issued to accompany a separate
brochure on Shetland, Orkney, and the Western Isles. A model of optimism
and clarity, or what?
''All three island groups are positioned at a cross-roads of where
(sic) the North Atlantic meets Europe,'' it states helpfully, presumably
for non-geographers who don't recognise the middle of the ocean when
they see it. ''They are all Scottish'' (there's a relief) and ''all
accessible (there's a fib) . . .
''Did You Know?'' asks an attached fact sheet designed for those who
didn't realise how handy Scotland is for the North Atlantic, that
''Almost 24,000 people live in the Shetland Islands -- greatly
outnumbered by about 30,000 gannets, 140,000 guillemots, 250,000
puffins, 300,000 fulmars, and at least 330,000 sheep.''
At least we now know why Shetlanders are never lonely.
Bouncing back
STILL with the Utter Isles, Shetland Health Board's most recent
Untowards Incidents Report (care of the Anything That Can Go Wrong Will
Go Wrong Dept) seems to suggest that the food in Lerwick's Gilbert Bain
Hospital is not all it might be. ''One patient,'' the report states
ominously, ''jumped over a first floor balcony.''
A helpful spokesman explains: ''It was a patient who reportedly saw a
friend and didn't realise that he was not on the ground floor. No
serious accident occurred.''
Time warp
WE KNEW that time hangs heavy on the hands of peers, but hadn't
realised just what a weight it is on the minds of some. Debating a
private member's bill which would, if passed, leave Scotland in a
different time zone from the rest of the UK (the 21st century, we
guess), Lord Palmer of Manderston, hailing from Duns, recently
demonstrated an acute grasp of the technical difficulties involved.
''I live in Scotland,'' he said, like a man who misses very little,
''and yet my nearest supermarket is in England. I would forever be
changing my watch when crossing the Border.''
It is, of course, the early peer who catches the fruit-and-nut muesli.
Unholy orders
WHEN feelings run high, people say the strangest things. Take John
Salvi, accused of shooting two American abortion workers late last year,
and clearly someone who doesn't seem yet to have quite grasped the
subtle difference between his ethics and his elbow.
Commenting on his trial, Salvi said recently: ''If convicted of these
charges I wish to receive the death penalty . . . if not proven guilty,
upon release I will become a Catholic priest.''
Feeling flush?
THE Advertiser (''Midlothian's Newspaper'') reports that St Mary's
Episcopal Church in Dalkeith has embarked on a fund-raising drive to
install a disabled toilet. Good for them, we say. To aid the effort, the
church has, of course, established a ''flush fund''.
Not taxing enough
THE Treasury, busy trying to flog off its Whitehall building in a
desperate last-ditch effort to revive the mortgage market, should take a
tip from the no-nonsense legislators of North Dakota. The state senate
there has just rejected a proposal to allow citizens to pay their taxes
with credit cards. Senator David Nething, a man destined for great
things, said ''paying taxes shouldn't be made too easy''.
Exterminate
AYL-CON II, a ''convention'' in Birmingham dedicated to all those poor
souls who never quite grew out of Doctor Who, announced itself with a
press release promising boundless treats the other week. ''Daleks and
Cybermen will be on hand for photo opportunities'', said the statement,
''and interviews can be arranged.'' Well, you wouldn't want to speak to
an actor would you?
Unhealthy glow
WE don't say that the late and much lamented Peter Cook smoked too
much, we merely recall the apocryphal remark attributed to Jonathan
Miller after a chance meeting with the comic. ''Oh look,'' the doctor
said, ''Peter's gone prematurely orange.''
Short-changer
FINALLY, and still with substance abuse, the legend (no, we don't
believe it either) reaches the Diary of a desperate customer entering an
Edinburgh pub and ordering a fast double whisky, which he downs in one.
''I shouldn't have had that with what I've got,'' he tells the barman.
''Why, what have you got?''
''Ten pence.''

READING-BASED Scot Ian Edmond confirmed that he is on course for a
second appearance in the European Junior Swimming Championships with an
impressive haul of four medals in last weekend's British Grand Prix meet
in Gloucester.
The 16-year-old claimed medals in all three breast-stroke events,
including a gold in the 50m, and also won the 100m free-style.
Having gained experience of the European junior event in the Czech
Republic last year, he has set his sights on a medal in Geneva in July.
Edmond is now coached by former Scottish director of swimming, Hammy
Smith.
Another Anglo-Scot hoping to represent Britain on the European stage
this summer is Angela Pendrich. The 18-year-old had a disappointing
Commonwealth Games -- she was on a course of pain-killers, and has since
had her wisdom teeth removed -- but has benefited from a recent switch
of clubs.
A full-timer, she trains alongside England's Commonwealth Games
back-stroke gold medallist Martin Harris at the Waltham Forest Club for
two hours every morning, and then returns for the evening club session.
''I'm giving it absolutely everything to make the European team,''
said the 18-year-old, who missed out by just a fraction of a second for
the 400m free-style place at the 1992 Olympics. ''My new coach, Paul
Barnes, has been a great help. The only problem is the amount of
travelling. I spend around three hours in the car every day.''
She is also considering a switch to the 200m back-stroke, and will
compete in that event in the British Grand Prix Meet in Leeds next
month.
Another target is the Eight Nations Tournament in Edinburgh in April,
four days before the European Championship trials in Sheffield.

SIR Alick Rankin intends to step down as chairman of brewing giant
Scottish &amp; Newcastle and another major Edinburgh company, Christian
Salvesen, before taking over the chair at insurance group General
Accident in 1997.
After being appointed director and joint deputy chairman of the
Perth-based insurance group yesterday, Sir Alick said: ''I would not
believe and I do not think my colleagues at General Accident would
believe it was wise to double up on major chairmanships.''
One of the pillars of the Edinburgh financial establishment, Sir
Alick, 60, who was chief executive of FTSE-100 company Scottish &amp;
Newcastle between 1983 and 1992, will have served as chairman for eight
years, assuming he stands down in 1997. He will have been with the group
for 37 years, serving on the board for 24 of them.
If all goes according to plan, he will succeed current General
Accident chairman Lord Airlie at the company's annual general meeting in
April 1997. Yesterday, Sir Alick resigned as director of tobacco giant
BAT Industries, to avoid any conflict of interest with its insurance
subsidiaries.
He is currently paid about #300,000 a year by Scottish &amp; Newcastle and
#85,000 by distribution, specialist hire and food services company
Christian Salvesen. Sir Alick expects to give up his non-executive,
honorary and non-remunerative chairmanship of Scottish Financial
Enterprise in the summer, after three years in the post.
Commenting on his impending departure from Scottish &amp; Newcastle, Sir
Alick said: ''One way and another it is long overdue. Scottish &amp;
Newcastle has had me around a long time.''
Looking forward to taking over the helm of the insurance giant,
another top 100 company, he said: ''General Accident is one of
Scotland's great companies and one of the foremost insurance companies
in Britain and Europe. There is no question about the pleasure, the
honour and the excitement of doing that job.''
Sir Alick saw no reason to give up his positions on the boards of Bank
of Scotland, retailing giant Sears, international trading company James
Finlay and Securities Trust of Scotland as a result of his planned
appointment as chairman of General Accident.

SCOTLAND'S shinty clubs have until Saturday, February 18, to make
their minds up about the new national pilot league for next season.
There was a vote in favour of the move towards a national league by
sanctioning a one-year pilot scheme. Clubs have since then being playing
for places in the new set-up and this week the Camanachd Association,
the game's ruling body, issued the invitation to clubs to apply.
The plan is to make the structure more competitive, and this season's
matches have been just that. This Saturday brings key matches in the
battle for top-four places in both the north and south.
The pick of the games is in the south, where Oban Camanachd, the south
champions, meet Glasgow Mid Argyll, who are currently second, four
points adrift but with a game in hand.
In the north, Skye, who now look set for fourth place, meet Fort
William, who haven't played since December 17 because of bad weather.
There was more good news on the island this week with the District
Council's commitment to building a new pitch, which will eventually be
big enough to take senior shinty matches if required.
The council's #65,000 investment in the pitch at Kyleakin brings their
total commitment to playing fields in recent years to more than
#300,000, with the new playing field at Portree, which will become Skye
Camanachd's new home in August, nearing completion.
Club chairman Kenny Mackay praised the Council's commitment to sport
on the island. ''We are deeply indebted to the council for all they are
doing, and while the Kyleakin pitch isn't primarily for senior shinty,
it is good to know that we might have an alternative in years to come if
need be.''

FORMER workers of a Courtaulds subsidiary have shrugged off the shock
of redundancy to found their own knitwear firm in Kirkintilloch,
celebrating the launch with a #40,000 order from Miss Selfridge.
Glendale was formed with #90,000 in initial financing from 17
ex-employees of Glenalva -- a Kilsyth-based firm which was closed two
months ago -- and backed by Dunbartonshire Enterprise, the Coal Board
and the Scottish Co-operatives Development Company.
''Whereas the previous company focused on children's schoolwear we see
ourselves not only producing that but also moving into youngsters'
fashions,'' design director Oonagh Shackleton said yesterday.
A turnover of around #500,000 is the first-year target for Glendale
which has yet to appoint a managing director. Three directors are
currently in joint charge.
''Our short-term aim is to use surplus stock to create a low-cost,
high-quality range,'' Ms Shackleton said. ''Over the longer term we are
looking to produce an exclusive own-label collection for independent
boutiques and chains.''
The employee-owner status looks set to continue for the immediate
future as the spirit of co-operation is seen as vital in reacting to the
demands of customers, particularly in the fickle world of fashion orders
which have to be met quickly.

HAVING the world hurdles record denied him at the Kelvin Hall last
year has proved no barrier to Colin Jackson's return.
The world's supreme hurdler confirmed yesterday that the Glasgow
international against France a fortnight on Saturday will be one of only
two indoor races in Britain this winter.
The Welshman went home from last year's indoor match against the USA
believing he had broken the world best for 60m hurdles. But rescrutiny
of the photo-finish revealed he had merely equalled it.
He accepted the decision without rancour, finishing unbeaten after 36
hurdles races, including the European and Commonwealth crowns, a world
record of 12.91, and a unique European indoor double over the barriers
and on the flat.
Jackson confirmed yesterday that, defending his world title apart, the
clock will be his motivation this year. ''I'm pretty confident I can
duck under 12.90,'' he said.
His indoor season begins with both the hurdles and the flat 60m
against Russia, on Saturday. But even the world indoor championships in
Barcelona is shelved -- he is going to Australia for five weeks'
preparation.

IN the early hours of this morning, in the French Alps above the Cote
d'Azur, the final stages of the sixty-third Monte Carlo Rally were being
fought out over snow and ice-covered cols.
Carlos Sainz, winner in 1991, had 26 seconds in hand as he prepared
himself mentally for the closing stages. ''We will have to attack,''
said Sainz, ''but we won't go crazy. The roads are more icy than I
expected.''
The man most likely to deny the 32-year-old Spaniard and the Subaru
Impreza team the champagne in Monte Carlo this morning is Francois
Delecour, last year's winner.
Delecour, driving a Ford Escort, will no doubt draw strength from the
fanatical French spectators who are expected to turn out in their
thousands.
Revelation of the event has been Andrew Cowan's new signing, Tommi
Makinen, driving a Mitsubishi Lancer. This is only his second attempt at
this specialised rally, the opening round of the world championship, yet
the 30-year-old Finn has stayed in touch and was poised to capitalise if
either faltered.
Interim positions after 17 stages:
1, C Sainz (Spain), Subaru Impreza, 5hr 09min.28sec; 2, F Delecour
(France), Ford Escort, 26sec. behind; 3, T Makinen (Finland), Mitsubishi

Britain's Martin Brundle and Japanese driver Aguri Suzuki will partner
Frenchman Olivier Panis this season. The deal with Brundle indicates
that former world champion Nigel Mansell will now almost certainly race
for the McLaren team.
The news also means that Johnny Herbert looks set for a drive
alongside world champion Michael Schumacher at the Benetton Renault
team. Herbert had signed a contract with Ligier for 1995 prior to last
year's European Grand Prix, but was switched over to Benetton by Ligier
owner and Benetton managing director Flavio Briatore for the final two
races of 1994.

A SHAKE-UP in the Legal Aid system to stop the wealthy claiming huge
sums at taxpayers' expense, was urged in the Commons yesterday. Tory
John Marshall (Hendon South) highlighted cases where people had been
able to claim more than #1m yet had lifestyles ''far superior to the
vast majority''.  The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, has
announced plans to publish in the spring a consultation green paper on
changes to the legal aid scheme.

In Stephen Fraser's report he ascribed the quote ''desecration'' to
me. In fact the word I used was ''privatisation'' (January 14).
The privatisation of part of Kelvingrove Park is rejected by every
community council in the north-west of Glasgow. It was unanimously
rejected at the national conference of the Scottish Labour Party in
March, 1993.
Why then are the city Labour group busy trying to sell off Glasgow's
parks?

There must be very many old soldiers like myself aghast at the fate of
paratrooper Private Lee Clegg -- convicted for murder while in the line
of duty in Northern Ireland -- and saying to themselves, ''There but for
the grace of God . . .''
Had the incident that brought about the deaths of the two youngsters
-- ''joyriders'' is a misnomer for persons bent on trivialising the law
by breaking it -- not gone grievously wrong as a result of their theft
and law-breaking, the youngsters would be alive today and Private Clegg
would be a free man.
It was a hideous miscalculation by the youngsters because they thought
they could tweak the nose of authority as a prank and get away with it,
and on the part of Private Clegg and his fellows because they had only a
split second in which to make a decision, and they made the wrong one.
Which begs the question: what if the occupants of the car had been
terrorists bent on creating carnage?
Conjecture and fact are very different things and Private Clegg and
his fellows acted when seemingly they should not have acted. The lot of
those who guard the gate is no sinecure and not to be defined in lines
of close print.
But now Private Clegg's conviction and life sentence is very much
fact, and in the eyes of the High Court, the Appeal Court, the media,
and the general public, all save his fellow soldiers, Private Clegg is
bracketed along with Myra Hindley, Brady, Peter Manuel, Boyle, and all
those others convicted for murder that was motivated, calculated, and
deliberate.
Private Clegg looks the epitome of a good soldier, and he has my
whole-hearted support for what he did.
I write as one who, aged 20, was on nightly guard duty with
instructions that were simple and succinct: ''Expect the unexpected,
challenge everything that moves, if it doesn't respond to a second
challenge, shoot -- then call out the guard.''
These instructions were to the point and easy to understand having
regard to conditions then, and do not differ greatly from those existing
in Northern Ireland until recently -- and even now only on hold.
It seems to me that Pontius Pilate would have found himself in
congenial company among the traducers of Private Clegg and his
companions and I look to those who respect natural justice to close
ranks.

EVEN in these days of advanced telecommunications and
tele-conferencing, it would appear that the market for what one could
describe as ''old fashioned'' business conferences and meetings is still
flourishing. Man in general and executive man in particular, it would
appear, is still a gregarious animal.
As competition in industry and commerce becomes even more intensive
nationally and internationally, and as companies seek to cut down on the
costs, such bodies have to have ever more worldly-wise groups of
managers and executives on their staffs. This is one of the reasons why
the investment made in the conference trade is flourishing. They regard
this type of investment as making their executives more sharply
competitive and therefore being money well spent.
Nowhere is the conference business flourishing better than in the east
of Scotland.
One of the institutions in this part of the country is the Heart of
Midlothian Football Club. Established in 1874, the club has for some
time now realised the importance of diversifying its work from its
football activities into the provision of corporate business conference
facilities. Business functions may be held in any one of the club's
suites -- the Willie Bauld Restaurant, the Executive Club, the Premier
Suite, the Business Club, and the appropriately named Tynecastle Suite.
Hearts can accommodate any organisation from the smallest party up to a
conference for 100 people.
Also in Edinburgh, the university has for some considerable time
offered a choice of flexible and fully-equipped conference facilities,
ranging from modern and purpose-built lecture theatres to prestigious
and historic meeting rooms. Conferences here can accommodate groupings
of up to 2000 delegates. As with so many other bodies and institutions
which provide conference facilities, Edinburgh University adopts a
''one-door'' approach. This means that its conference office will
co-ordinate everything, including support services, on behalf of the
customer.
There are also a number of extensive and fully serviced areas
available for exhibitions and poster displays. Many of these are
conveniently located close by the conference rooms. For seminars and
training courses, there is the John McIntyre Centre, which is located in
parkland setting and which provides executive accommodation for up to
150 delegates. All this is available with state-of-the-art audio visual
facilities to hand.
Another east coast university offering similar facilities is that of
St Andrews. New Hall, the university's recently opened 500-bed residence
near to the town centre and golf courses, has its own meeting rooms and
it is also near to theatres which can seat up to 300 delegates, these
theatres being complemented by what its literature calls ''breakout
rooms'' and exhibition areas. In addition to New Hall is the Younger
Hall which offers audio-visual services and which can seat up to 1000.
It goes without saying that the dining venues include some of the most
beautiful and historic buildings in Scotland's oldest university.
In Bonnyrigg in Midlothian, a few miles south of Edinburgh, is
Dalhousie Castle. Although the hotel here is presently undergoing
refurbishment and redecoration, this work will have been completed by
early March. This location, set in unspoilt countryside, offers five
rooms -- the Ramsay, the Alexander, the Dalwolsey, the Gun Room, and the
Brechin, with a theatre capacity of, respectively, 120, 100, 20, 60, and
16, and a classroom capacity of, respectively, 60, 50, 12, 50, and 12.
Additional attractions are that the conference office at the castle can
organise archery and clay pigeon shooting on the grounds surrounding it.
It can also provide what its literature coyly describes as being
''ancient barrel-vaulted dungeons'' for dinner.
At Glenrothes in Fife is another ''House'' of architectural and
historic importance. This is Balbirnie at Markinch near Glenrothes. This
hotel, the centrepiece of a 416-acre estate and country park landscaped
in the style of Capability Brown, and including specimen trees and a
virtually unrivalled collection of rhododendrons, offers special event
conference banqueting areas, accommodating gatherings of between 10 and
150 people. The rooms available are the Ballingal (accommodating 150 in
theatre style), the Crichton, (70), the Dalrymple (50), the West (70),
the Garden (30), and the Balfour (20).
Within the perimeter of Balbirnie Park itself are available extensive
recreational and leisure pursuits. There is golf, jogging, woodland
walking, and, for those interested in nature, there are, in addition to
the many historical aspects on site, such as stone circles and stob
crosses, many other fine items of interest. The park is also home to an
abundance of wildlife, while close to the hotel itself is a craft centre
incorporating a leather workshop, a goldsmith and jeweller's shop, and
an art gallery. In the specific context of golf, the courses of St
Andrews are a mere 30 minutes' drive distant.
At Whitburn in West Lothian stands the Hilcroft Hotel. This hotel
offers two locations for the holding of conferences -- the main function
suite (which can accommodate up to 200 people) and the Meeting Room
(accommodating up to 50 delegates). All normal conference facilities are
available here, including overhead projectors and screens, recording
facilities, television and video equipment, and flip charts.
The provisions of conference facilities in the east of Scotland is big
business nowadays . It is also a business which has become much more
sophisticated as the years have gone by.

* FOURTH week of 1995 and most folk are well shot of New Year
resolutions. Remember the top item on the annual list: to get fit. But
how can you make certain next time the health bug bites that you will
really stick to that exercise regime, get along to those aerobics
classes, do that workout, and jog another mile.
Fitness guru Martica Heaner believes that most of us flunk out on
exercise because we set ourselves unrealistic goals.
In her new book Curves -- The Body Transformation Strategy (published
by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, price #9.99) Heaner advises how to plan a
personal fitness programmes tailored to your own physical and
psychological needs.
She suggest you choose an activity which is enjoyable, instead of
forcing yourself to do something that bores or torments you. Swim
instead of jog, cycle instead of working out all the time and vary your
exercises to maintain your interest.
As for the excuses aspiring coach potatoes have to hand to dodge
exercising, Martica Heaner has heard them all before.
''Exercise needs to become a habit, a normal part of your everyday
life.''

EDINBURGH-based mutual life office Scottish Widows, whose marketing
symbol is the woman in black, yesterday announced that it was to set up
a banking operation.
It had applied for and been granted a Banking Licence by the Bank of
England effective from January 1, 1995. The move into banking will be
accompanied by a build up of the office's existing treasury management.
The life office stated: ''Significant volumes of funds under
management may be held in cash from time to time and in an increasingly
sophisticated financial environment this requires ever greater
expertise.''
With approximately #20bn funds under management there are times when
up to #1000m of this may be held in cash.
Scottish Widows stressed that its intention to form a bank should not
be interpreted in any way as some kind of assault on bankassurers -- the
High Street banks which market insurance and pension products. ''It is
simply a natural extension of Scottish Widows' existing business.''
However, in the increasingly competitive financial services market,
Scottish Widows' radical move is almost certain to be perceived as a way
of hitting back at the opposition.
All life insurers are coming under increasing pressure in the run-up
to changes in regulations which will require them to provide customers
with more information about charges.
Scottish Widows was keeping quiet yesterday as to just exactly what
its banking operation would involve -- whether, for example, it would be
opening retail branches. This would seem a natural move if it is to
extend the marketing of its products. Up to now, group products have
been sold largely through independent financial advisers but under
disclosure this could become more difficult.
Cost-cutting has been a feature of the life insurance sector in the
current environment and Scottish Widows was no exception. In November it
announced the closure of 12 branch processing offices and the loss of
143 jobs.
It has also a new set of policies and pension products and prepared
all its products to meet the new disclosure rules. To attract customers,
Scottish Widows is concentrating on market leading early surrender
values and transfer values, and also enhanced allocations later in the
policy term along with competitive pricing.

STEPHEN Hendry cruised into familiar territory with another
comfortable snooker victory at the #180,000 Regal Welsh Open in Newport
last night.
The unstoppable Scot easily secured his quarter-final place in the
first world-ranking tournament of the year by trouncing Amsterdam-based
Londoner Chris Scanlon 5-0.
Hendry has conceded only two frames in three outings at the event and
has now put together 20 matches without defeat since November.
The world champion said: ''I won my first two games here easily enough
but I played much better tonight and I am a lot happier with my form.
The bandwagon keeps rolling on.''
Hendry had far too much ammunition for world No.111 Scanlon as he
fired in breaks of 88, 56, 75, 54, and 70.
But he can expect a much sterner examination from fellow Scot Chris
Small in the last eight. Leith's Small, beaten only 5-4 on the black by
Hendry in the last 64 of October's Skoda Grand Prix, maintained the
heavy scoring he has produced this week in beating Dubliner Fergal
O'Brien 5-1.
Former bank clerk Small, who will be appearing in the quarter-finals
of a ranking tournament for the first time, compiled breaks of 44, 80,
87, 86.
A Scottish hat trick was completed when 19-year-old John Higgins, the
Grand Prix champion, beat sole surviving Welshman Paul Davies 5-2.
Ronnie O'Sullivan walked a tightrope before edging out Nottingham's
Anthony Hamilton 5-4. When world No.35 Hamilton impressively built a 4-1
advantage with breaks of 52, 93, 111, 42, and 71, a surprise looked on
the cards.
But O'Sullivan fired in a 105 break in frame six and won the next
after an outrageous fluke on a pink when he was clearing up, and he
forced a decider with a 75 break in frame eight.
Hamilton was presented with one golden opportunity but one glaring
error cost him dear. Holding a 20-point advantage and with the reds
fanned out nicely, Hamilton missed a simple black and O'Sullivan duly
took the match with a run of 48. Other third-round results:
M Flowerdew (Eng) beat A Bolsover (Eng) 5-3; P Ebdon (Eng) beat J Read
(Eng) 5-4; J Swail (N Ire) beat M Price (Eng) 5-2; S Davis (Eng) beat M
Williams (Wales) 5-3.

You carried a report in which Scottish Television claimed its news
audience was increasing (January 24).
The latest AGB/BRB audience analysis shows, year on year, that
Reporting Scotland has increased its audience share by 15.2% while
Scotland Today's share has dropped by 2.5%. The comparison between the
first three weeks of 1995 with the same period last year shows an
increase for the BBC of 48,000 viewers while Scottish Television's
figures have dropped by 35,000.
Reporting Scotland's strength is that it provides the only national
news programme in Scotland. We welcome that the public recognises this
and, with an average audience of 620,000 throughout Scotland, our
figures are on the increase.

Your reported comment that an Iona Community guide told the pilgrims
that ''Jesus was a homosexual'' is most disturbing (January 7). Such a
comment is insulting and blasphemous to a prophet of God and all the
more to the ''Son of God''.
Jesus Christ was one of the distinguished prophets of God and is
revered by Muslims and Christians alike. It is sad and surprising that
no Christian guru has so far taken note of such a shameful remark and
condemned it.
I wonder what the law of blasphemy is, for if it cannot protect
Christianity, never mind other religions.
Homosexuality has been condemned both by the Koran and the Bible and
yet in utter disregard to the divine teachings some people have thrown
mud on the holy prophets who are of the highest character and a model
for their nation.
I hope this will jog the guide's conscience and motivate him to offer
a public apology to both Christians and Muslims who all believe in Jesus
Christ and respect him from their heart.

A BRISKLY wielded pneumatic drill, I've often thought, would do
wonders to end the agony of sweet rustling in the cinema. If it were
applied, say, to the pierced ear of the lady in the row in front. The
one with the maxitub of popcorn in one mitt and the giant bag of Tacos
in her lap. To say nothing of the mints, each hygienically,
individually, shrink-wrapped in crackling Cellophane, in her pocket.
Slurping I can just about handle, the clinker-like sound of crushed
ice being scoured with a straw, even the sooking of cola dregs can be
tholed -- just -- when the miscreant is three and a half. I don't know
who you were, missus, but you will never know how close you came to a
painful, if mercifully swift end, in darkness on a drab Saturday
afternoon.
Close enough anyway for a crazed woman to pack up two children, three
coats, a Barbie Fairy Princess, a clutch of air balloons and a basic
instinct to murder and flit to the front row. You can see the headlines:
Popcorn Killer Slays Sucker. Oh the ignominy of being led away,
flashguns popping, arm-locked by square-jawed boys in homburgs, the
drill held up for gloating inspection by the throng of tabloid beasties.
But, then, think of the deep satisfaction.
I would have to plead PMS -- Popcorn Murder Syndrome -- and yell ''get
me Kennedy''. It would be just my luck if they brought me Charles.
(Look, I know it's prejudice, but I really cannot take seriously men
with carrot-coloured hair. Neither, come to think of it, could most of
the country at the last election.) Anyway, I'd be forced to throw myself
on the mercy of a jury who would no doubt be surreptitiously chewing
Clarnico mints and inhaling Lucozade through an intravenous drip. The
judge would chomp on a pack of Victory Vs to breathe fire and brimstone
while  pronouncing the sentence of a life of Saturdays imprisoned in a
small cinema complex.
Noisy eaters, don't you find, are such a distraction from the delight
of sitting with a ricked neck in a cinema the size of a lobby cupboard.
A very small lobby cupboard. Where to store dancing brooms for the
Sorcerer's Apprentice would entail sawing them in half. Where the screen
is less silver than an eye-crossing sensation of vibrant, clashing
colours it takes an hour and a half to decode into human form. If you
can call Richard Attenborough's 'human form'. But that's unkind.
I made a vow as I reeled red-eyed, humphy-backed and sobbing with
relief from the insy-winsy auditorium last Saturday.  Never again would
I mock Attenborough. Just as, a month previously, I made a silent
promise never again to be cynical about Andrew Lloyd Webber after seeing
the joy on the children's faces during Joseph and His Amazing
Technicolor Dream Coat. (What, by the way, happened to the U? Joseph, I
seem to recall, was not from Omaha, Nebraska, and no he wasn't from
Dorking either, but the English spelling is preferable to those of us
fighting a losing battle against the insidious effects of Tinseltown
culture on educational values and biological inexactitudes: how, by the
way, do you explain to a four year old how Arnold Scharzennegger got
heavily pregnant?)
The pledge to stop sniggering at Andrew Lloyd Webber's smug visage
was, of course, made before the six-year-old wore out three thousand
batteries, two cassette recorders, a matching set of parental nerves,
and the Joseph tape purchased in a moment of sentimentality on Christmas
Eve. Let him be warned, if Attenborough so much as threatens to release
a tape he will be stalked through darkened auditoriums with a pneumatic
drill.
Still, we working parents, when we're not carelessly failing to
batch-bake fairy buns, selfishly refusing to wear a beige cardigan and
corrugated perm to join the formidable ladies who inhabit the Oxfam
shop, sometimes we do manage to squeeze in a bit of parenting between
counting our dual incomes and shouting at the nanny.
Tardy, yes, we are often that. We may have been the last parent in the
country to take the children to see Miracle on 34th Street. We may be
obsessive career-minded floosies preventing obsessive career-minded
himbos from doing our jobs. But at least we have raging guilt to drive
us on.
Last week, we had a student of journalism in the office called Tim.
When he was 22, his mother confessed the deep guilt she had always felt
at going out to work throughout his childhood. As a journalist.
''Amazed me,'' said Tim. ''I was an extremely happy child, never
occurred to me women shouldn't work.'' I could have kissed him but it
might have been construed as harassment in the workplace so I just felt
relieved instead. Tim, I am so happy to report, is a clever, balanced,
pleasant young men.
Our case has not been helped, though, by the latest reason to scour
the city for mission halls offering absolution and a bit of spiritual
Toronto-style succour at 9.30pm on a Sunday evening.  Tears Before
Bedtime has done an enormous disservice to all us working parents who
employ a nanny.
Now everyone knows we are agonising over whether to have a torrid
affair with our partner's louche best friend while whipping up a Habitat
storm of a kitchen supper party and trying to pally up with the
domestics while being sneered at by those below stairs. As if. None of
the women I know who work have the energy, never mind the inclination,
for a bit of naughty with sixties retards.
It's not that there is not an element of truth in some of the
storylines. Yes, I know someone whose nanny ran away with the child and
ended up singing Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam in a police cell. Yes, I
know a nanny whose holiday pay was docked when, rather than take the
time off, she spent her last fortnight with the children before leaving
after eight years service. And yes, I confess, I even know a woman who
bought a Habitat rug in the sale.

A SWEET little bridesmaid of my acquaintance once charmed an entire
wedding party -- bar one -- with her child's view of the world. As
pretty as the proverbial picture, she had boldly and loudly proclaimed
with a smile to one of the male guests that another had given her a #1
coin for a kiss.
He asked: ''Oh, can I have one?''
Her reply: ''Yes, he's over there!''
Children at weddings are an ingredient, which can elicit the ''oohs''
and the ''aahs'' out of the most battle-weary wedding guest. But unlike
bridesmaids who have earned the right to be nicely turned out and as
true friends will not outshine, flower girls and pages are the ones
brides should be wary of; they can steal the show, particularly in some
of the natty little wedding outfits which are currently around.
Tartan trewed little pages and be-ribboned flower girls are the very
stuff of relatives' delight but like the adult bridal market, there is
now a lot more imagination being employed to allow children to add to
the individuality of a wedding.
The cue for the styling of flower girl and page clothes tends to come
direct from the bridal gown and the bridesmaids' dresses and having
found a stylish and individualistic look, some may be tempted to carry
throughout the main wedding party.
But it is an approach full of inherent dangers with what is elegant in
adult size often becoming devastatingly cute -- in both sweet and
cloying terms -- in pint-size form.
Styles, which are on the naive rather than sophisticated side, offer
the best chances of harmonious success for children's bridal outfits and
the emergence of bridesmaids' floral dresses offers an option which is
particularly effective on tall and tiny frames correspondingly garbed.
From the pattern of florals, it should be an easy matter for a
seamstress or bridal boutique to pick up on a base colour, such as rose
pink, which is then incorporated into the bridal gown say on piping or
on additional flower buds. The chosen floral material can then be part
of the main bodice for the bridesmaids and the overskirt for the
flowergirls.
A number of dressmakers and bridal design houses prefer to ring the
changes by varying styling details from adult to child versions with,
for instance, bolero jackets for the bridesmaids and bowed closed
jackets for the children.
Continuity is provided by the material while the monotony is relieved
by the different applications. Straighter simpler dresses for
bridesmaids can also be offset by more flouncy creations for flower
girls, who in their innocence can carry off frou frou additions in which
older maids would flounder.
These can range from floral overdresses over underskirts matched with
the bridesmaids' gowns. And even brides with good taste in their bones
will appreciate that children's clothes can also cope with many a splash
of added decoration from big bandeau waists to a surfeit of sewn-on silk
flowers.
The cue for children at weddings is to think laterally. Twenties style
brides can recall the heyday of art nouveau and the big liners by
dressing their minor attendants more effectively as little sailors with
smart blue piped collars on dresses and tops.
Similarly lush medieval style presentations, currently in vogue, can
cope with pages say completely turned out in one of the minor colours
featured by the main party, with a velvet two set of jacket and trews
lightened by gilt accessories.
Gold and russet tones being a new keynote of the coming season, it
makes bringing the children's outfits into line very easy with simple
garments given polish by gilt buttons and gold bows.
By and large, the tone for little bridal attendants is Victoriana with
plenty of lace for both boys and girls.

January 22.
I understand Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, and Portugal have
coastal communities which have had a long-standing traditional
dependence on the fishing industry. It is also true that most, if not
all, traditional fishing grounds used by these national groups have been
overfished.
It seems, therefore, that pressure is on the fishing boats to go
further afield, and they end up encroaching on other countries'
traditional fishing grounds.
We remember the indignant scenes of last summer when British boats
were repulsed by the Portuguese and Spanish when the British net-fishing
boats entered the traditional tuna fishing grounds used by the
Portuguese line fishermen.
All of this is easily understood and one can sympathise with both
sides in these disputes, although the political posturing is always too
predictable.
What I fail to grasp, however, is the logic behind the EU-inspired
settlement which appears to have been a complete British cave-in to the
pressure of the Spanish and Portuguese.
They can send their boats to continue the overfishing of the grounds
off our coastline, we get no similar concessions in their waters, and to
add insult to injury we have to reduce the number of British boats
fishing.
The decommissioning scheme pays our own fishing industry to destroy
itself and to destroy the traditional way of life practised by
generations in these fishing communities.
Meanwhile the other nations' fishing fleets go on about their business
on our doorstep.

I note that the Government is now going to give our fishermen #53m
compensation for losing the right to fish freely in our waters.
That a British Government should use its taxpayers' money to enable
Spain to filch our fish and put more of our fishermen out of work is a
double stroke of genius which must be unparalleled in the long history
of a sovereign Great Britain.
The Common Fisheries Policy has reached the heights of absurdity
previously attained only by the Common Agricultural Policy; does the
Government not recognise this? Must we be so afraid of the EU; if so,
why?

ABOUT umbrellas there is a first law. It states that on any stretch of
pavement when only one brolly catches the eye, it will surely also catch
my ear. There are similar second and third laws up to an umpteenth. In
their pecking order they will make that many more ear piercings. All
un-umbrella people suffer likewise.
For them this has been a wonderful winter so far. Not in memory have
wind and rain conspired so well to dish umbrellas. Gamps have been
fairly done down.
In a most heartening manner have their carcasses made untidy the
trottoirs. Deceased parasols have lain in spiky heaps all over the
highways like wrecked seabirds. Some in sorry condition have been
decently inhumed in litter bins. Most have just been put down where they
blew out. Ex-brollies get left to make their graveyard where they lie.
Umbrella people are like that. They don't care except for themselves,
never have. Diehards among them even continue to protect their heads
with canopies which are palpably expired, ribs broken and exposed, skin
hanging loose. Brolly boors live in their own cocoons.
So January's cull of their accessories has been most satisfactory.
Foul weather has been a good friend to their victims.
Doubtless it will be a temporary victory. Although battalions of
brollies have fallen, others will take their place. They will keep
coming in waves like the spears in the old Zulu picture. But, although a
little win, it has been about the only one in a 255-year war. Down with
Umbrellas! has never been a successful flag to fight under.
In Britain everything has been thrown at them without success. Wild
insult, including sexist abuse, has got nowhere. Accusations of snobbery
came unstuck. Even military discipline won no ground.
Such steady defeat offers no good hope of clearing the streets of
newer pests -- users of mobile phones, haulers of shopping bogies,
school pupils with half-hundredweight bags of books (or rocks?) on their
backs, skateboarders.
Long failure to beat the brolly offers little chance of doing down all
other pestilential pedestrians. Here and there, though, may be wee
inklings about how not to set about them.
Ever since in London (in 1740) Jonas Hanway, otherwise a genial cove
and a kind man to orphan children, was the first and only umbrella man
in the land, every stick and stone has been thrown.
Because a rainstick was seen as an effete import, Frenchman! was cried
after members of the brolly brigade. Urchins jeered that they wore
petticoats on their heads. They were called skint because they skimped
on cab fares and ungodly on the grounds that if God meant people to have
dry heads, He would not send rain. They were seen as ridiculous.
Lord Wellington thought so. He took time off from fighting the French
to bash brollies as out of place on a battlefield.
Lord Wellington (came the order) does not approve the use of umbrellas
during the enemy's firing, and will not allow Gentlemen's Sons to make
themselves ridiculous in the eyes of the army.
Genteel etiquette also took a hand. Away back in 1801, and all to no
avail, was published a fragrant bouquet of a little book that sweetly
drew attention to the folly of a brolly:
Every passer-by either jerks up his umbrella to the sky, whereby the
shorter endangers with the points of his whalebone the eyes of the
taller, or dashes it to the ground so as to impede all passage.
What should have been the most telling strike came from Christopher
North, the Paisley-born philosopher and Edinburgh gadabout. He wrote
that people who carried an umbrella were past it, although he quoted the
thought more elegantly.
''Whenever the day comes that I'm seen unfurling an umbrella,'' North
made a wise old Scotchman remark, ''may that day be my last, for it'll
be proof that the pith's a' oot o' me.''
Sensible society's mistake is to be excessively ingenious against
umbrellas. They have thrived on hostile attention. Clever abuse has only
manured how they have mushroomed to stick in the ears, get up the nose,
and tear the spectacles from the faces of innocent bystanders. There is
now not enough pavement room on the planet to accommodate them.
How better to clear the streets is by ignoring them. Say nothing,
leave them alone, and they may stay at home. It seems also the only
trick left against other pedestrian people who take up too much room,
whether by hauling loud music with them wherever they go or those
wheeled suitcases they drag behind them.
To look on the bright side of this winter's damp tale it has taught
the only way to bring down brollies.
In the beginning parasols were an ancient Egyptian invention to keep
off, not rain, but the sun. What has been proved since the new year is
that there are limits to how much wetness modern brollies can stand.
Beating them will be a soggy business. They can be taken off the streets
only by storm. So let the wind blow! Rain on!

THREE sessions of evidence will be held in Scotland on the
Government's plans to reform child law in Scotland, MPs agreed
yesterday. At a private meeting of the Scottish Standing Committee which
will consider the Bill, it was agreed that two sessions would be held in
Glasgow and one in Edinburgh. The first session will take evidence from
voluntary organisations and bodies dealing with fostering and adoptions.
The second will concentrate on Reporters and others dealing with
childrens' hearings and the third will deal with the role of local
authorities and the Government.

Dr Elizabeth Scott gives expert advice about meningitis, the disease
which has recently struck with tragic consequences, and underlines the
need to be aware of its symptoms
DESPITE the recent deaths, meningitis is still a very rare illness.
The trouble is that when it attacks it is so overwhelming that there is
little time to diagnose and treat it.
It may be made even harder to diagnose because it has been partially
controlled by an antibiotic given for a more common infection such as
earache or tonsillitis.
We must be aware of the symptoms of meningitis.
Don't ignore an ill child or adult with fever, neck stiffness, and
intolerance of bright lights, especially if vomiting has also occurred.
Get a doctor. By the time the typical rash of meningococcal meningitis
shows they are very ill indeed.
Meningitis is an infection of the lining of the spinal cord and brain.
Its acute form is commonly caused by bacteria which may be present
normally in our noses and throats for years without ever giving trouble.
The relatively new HIB vaccination, given to all under-fives, has
lowered the incidence of meningitis from haemophilus influenza, a common
cause in the young, but it should not make mothers complacent because it
can be caused by many other organisms against which HIB vaccine gives no
protection.
Anyone, adult or child who runs an above-normal temperature, vomits,
complains of pains in the head, is unwilling to move his neck because
the movement hurts, and turns away from the light deserves a prompt
visit from or to the doctor.
Meningitis can be frighteningly quick to progress and nowadays GPs
carry penicillin in their cases to inject a possible case before they
can arrange to have them sent to hospital.
In hospital a lumbar puncture is a necessary part of further
investigation and will tell whether thre is meningeal infection, whether
it is bacterial or viral and what medicine will cure it. Putting a
needle into the canal beside the spinal cord may seem a rotten procedure
but it is not sensible to put off asking the doctor to seen an unwell
child with meningitis symptoms in the hope of avoiding these
investigations.
This disease may be rapid and fatal. You may be sure your GP has the
possibility in mind when any of the symptoms are present. The most
recent reports have been of meningitis caused by a meningococcus.
Inoculation against meningococcus type B, the most common cause of
meningoccal meningitis in Britain, is not available.
Meningitis caused by type A and C meningococci, more prevalent in the
Middle East, Africa, and India, may be protected against by inoculation.
If it is found that type A or C caused the recent sad death of a
15-year-old girl in Dumfries, contacts will be offered inoculation with
the vaccine and, whatever the type of meningococcus, all close contacts
will be given prophylactic medication to take for a few days, usually a
medicine called rifampicin.
Meningitis may also be caused by viruses often as an extension of an
infection such as mumps, measles or German measles. Inoculation against
these previously common childhood illnesses has caused a marked fall in
the incidence of viral meningitis. Some chronic cases such as
tuberculosis can also cause meningitis but these give a different
clinical picture and in this country are still uncommon.

THERE would be a compelling case for Scotland to have fewer than 56
MPs at Westminster, rather than the present 72, if a Scottish parliament
was established in Edinburgh, Lord Fraser of Carmylie, Scottish Minister
of State, told the House of Lords yesterday.
He said that reducing Scottish representation to the English
equivalent would produce about 56 Scots MPs, but as they would have less
to do than other Westminster MPs there was as strong case for cutting
the number even further.
He was answering Lord Ellenborough (Con.) who asked why it took 69,500
electors to return an English MP while the Scottish figure was 55,000.
Lord Fraser said several Parliaments since 1918 had endorsed the
provision that Scotland should have not fewer than 71 constituencies.
There had never been an equivalent provision for England.
Lord Ewing of Kirkford (Lab) said Lord Fraser should have the honesty
to admit that he had changed his mind as he had previously supported
devolution. Because of the Government's reorganisation of local
government Scotland would have less democratic representation than any
country in Europe.
Lord Fraser said the suggestions made by the former Conservatuive
Prime Minister Lord Home of the Hirsel had been very different from what
was now proposed.
Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove , from the Labour Front Bench, was
mildly barracked, as he suggested that Scottish representation in
''geographical terms'' would be about 90Mps.
Lord Fraser said the importance of Lord Home's intervention in the
1979 referendum campaign was that it showed Labour's proposals to be
fatally flawed. No significant effort had been made to remedy these
flaws, he added.

Harry Diamond bemoans the fact that his political masters prevented
the commissioning of a ''Glasgow piece of music'' (January 23). He will
therefore be overjoyed to be reminded that Anthony Burgess was glad to
write a Glasgow Overture as part of the Miles Better campaign. I passed
it to the (then) SNO which premiered it in 1984.
Its most recent performance was by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra
last summer.

RABBIE Burns found himself being thrust into the limelight at Scottish
Question Time yesterday as MPs swopped quotations on the Bard's words.
Devolution dominated the hour-long session on Burns Day, and it was
clear that MPs on both sides had been digging away at their books of
Burns poetry at home for suitable quotations to mark the occasion.
First up was Labour's renowned trouble-maker Dennis Canavan (Falkirk
West) who was trying to make Burns Day a national holiday, but was
turned down by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Mr Lang said: ''I do not think we need such an event to remember our
greatest poet. We have continued to celebrate his works since his death
almost 200 years ago and I am sure we will do so for many years to
come.''
The Labour MP replied that this was a negative and disappointing reply
but no-one, particularly the professional shorthand writers of Hansard,
was quite ready for what happened next.
Mr Canavan claimed that Burns was an ardent supporter of a Scottish
parliament and a ''fierce critic of the Unionists who used treachery,
bribery and skullduggery to destroy Scotland's last parliament.''
Working himself up to his full Scottish fire, he demanded: ''Why are
the Tories' prospects dim? Could it be the reputation of Ian, Allan,
Hector and Jim, such a parcel of rogues in a nation?''
Mr Lang, as usual, was equal to the task. To Tory cheers he said:
''Well, now I know what the poet meant when he spoke of a rhyming,
ranting, raving Billie. And let me say this -- hale be your heart, hale
be your fiddle, lang may your elbuck jink an' diddle.'' *
As for Burns being a supporter of a Scottish parliament, Mr Lang even
came armed with a quote of something the Bard had written for the
Dumfries Volunteer. Tories roared their approval as Mr Lang bellowed:
''Be Britain still to Britain true, among ourselves united, for never
but by British hands will British wrongs be righted.''
As the exchanges continued, Liberal Democrat MP Mrs Ray Michie
confused matters rather by suggesting that St Andrew's Day on November
30 could be an alternative for a national holiday.
She said: ''I wonder why the Scottish Office Ministers lack a sense of
adventure which would allow them to go out on their own, do womething in
terms of a national holiday for Scotland and never mind the Prime
Minister and his words of danger and more danger.''
Mr Lang, however, was ready with another Burns quote. He welcomed the
Royal Mail decision to produce a set of stamps to commemorate the
bicentenary of Burns death, said: ''As for another holiday, again as the
poet said: ''I am the keeper of the law in some small points although
not all.''
Mr Brian Donohoe (Cunninghame South -- Lab.) said that as he was the
only Ayrshireman in the House the holiday proposal should be taken
seriously. He was also concerned abut the decision to shift a Burns
monument in Irvine from a moor to a busy roundabout. Mr Lang said he was
not aware of the case but would look into it if he was given details.
And so it continued, with the Opposition parties giving of their best
on the matter of devolution and Mr Lang hitting back as hard as he could
on behalf of the Union.
The Scottish Secretary attacked councils in Scotland for taking on
extra staff at a time when their English counterparts were employing
fewer people. A total of 304,502 people were employed in local
government in Scotland at a cost of #898 a head, compared with #668 a
head in England.
English Tory MP Harry Greenway did himself no favours at all by saying
that the English people were paying for all this, and Mr Lang told the
House: ''One has to ask why, when there is a constraint on public
expenditure and when local authorities should be having consideration of
the burden they are imposing on council-tax payers, they have expanded
their staff by some 2500 in the past year -- an increase of around 1% --
when in England local government staff has been reduced by 2%.
''At a time when this Government has been seeking to reduce bureacracy
and simplify local government by introducing a singhle-tier structure,
Labour is bent on creating another centralising parliament in Edinburgh
which would increase bureaucracy, increase the burdens of administration
and centralise power away from local government to Edinburgh.''
From the Labour Front Bench, Mr John McAllion told Mr Lang that higher
levels of spending and employment in Scottish local government reflected
higher levels of social deprivation and illness and ''above all reflects
the increasing burdens which you have placed on Scottish councils.
If Mr Lang genuinely was concerned about comparisons between Scotland
and England, he should explain why for the past two-and-a-half years he
had refused to take up an offer from Cosla to commission an independent
study into the matter.
Mr Lang, who was told by Mr McAllion either to ''put up or shut up,''
again rose to the task. He retorted: ''You are totally misinformed. I
invited Cosla some two or three years ago to undertake this study. They
said they would and then they didn't.''
There were exchanges also about the number of people who had left
Scotland for England, and even a bit of Gaelic as Welsh Labour back
bencher Paul Flynn (Newport West) asked what proposals the Government
had to increase the teaching and use of Gaelic.
For the record, between mid-1975 and mid-1979, Scotland experienced an
average net migration loss to the rest of the UK of about 5000 people
annually. Apparently, though, they are coming back in droves, but Mr
Lang's line is that under devolution they will be driven away again.
Wherever Rabbie is, if he was listening to yesterday's Question Time
exchanges he was probably laughing his head off. Let's hope he had a
dram in his hand and a plate of haggis on the table.

It was good to read Harry Diamond's reminiscences of conversations
with Sir Alexander Gibson concerning a symphony for Glasgow (January
23).
In the light of the huge success of Celtic Connections at Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall, it seems worth pointing out that there is already a
beautiful musical tribute to Glasgow; it is of course William Jackson's
resounding Wellpark Suite which would, played by the Royal SNO, delight
the entire country.

Harry Diamond bemoans the lack of an orchestral work named after the
city of Glasgow (January 23). I am delighted to inform him of the
existence of a Glasgow Symphony and plans for a Glasgow Chamber
Symphony.
Scottish composer Edward McGuire wrote a Glasgow Symphony for the
National Youth Orchestra of Scotland as part of the 1990 city of culture
celebrations.
In 1996/97 the Glasgow Chamber Orchestra plans to commission a Glasgow
Chamber Symphony from John Maxwell Geddes to celebrate the orchestra's
40th anniversary. This commission will be the second in a series of
three new works to be commissioned by the Glasgow Chamber Orchestra.
The first work in the series, Caledonian Muse, by Edward McGuire, will
be performed in March 1996. Needless to say the three-year project is
largely dependent on a successful funding application to the Scottish
Arts Council. The orchestra has its fingers crossed as it awaits the
SAC's February meeting.
Mr Diamond appears to be a little critical of Glasgow City Council for
not commissioning a Glasgow work. Although the Glasgow Chamber Orchestra
plans to fund its commissions through sponsorship and a subsidy from the
Scottish Arts Council, it is grateful for the financial support that
Glasgow City Council, Eastwood District Council, and Bearsden &amp;
Milngavie District Council have provided in recent years.
This funding, together with commercial sponsorship, has enabled the
orchestra to get a firmer financial footing and to consider undertaking
projects of this nature.

SELECTION at the highest level is difficult to achieve in any sport,
but over the years, generations of Scottish rowers have felt that the
odds have been stacked against them.
Quite rightly, British selection is based on performances at land and
water assessments, but until recently, all of these have been held
around London, placing talented Scots at a disadvantage as they cope
with the effects of long-distance travel, often in terrible winter
weather conditions, on the day when their performance really needs to be
the best possible.
Over the last four years, Mark Banks has been in charge of selection
for Britain's junior teams and he alone has made efforts to travel to
the regions for assessments. As a result, for the third year running,
Great Britain junior assessments will take place on the Clyde in the
first weekend of February.
If the events of the last two years repeat themselves, a number of
strong rowing schools and clubs from northern England will take part in
these trials as well as the best of Scottish crews.
The exercise has proved to be valuable, with a high proportion of
Scots gaining selection for Great Britain teams. If this policy had been
adopted among the seniors in the eighties, perhaps world champions Peter
Haining and Jim McNiven would not have felt the need to relocate down
south, and perhaps top-level domestic rowing in Scotland would be
stronger, too.
Banks will be accompanied in Scotland by Brian Armstrong, Britain's
international rowing manager. The Scottish Amateur Rowing Association
should take advantage of his presence to discuss possible ways of using
Scotland more closely in senior selection activities.
Meanwhile, the Scottish indoor championships, being held at Glasgow
Caledonian University, take place this Sunday. Entries are allowed on
the day and the action gets under way at 10 o'clock.

John Williamson's review of the Carol Laula concert is pleasing to all
those lucky enough to have witnessed such a fine show (January 19).
Could this review not have served some positive purpose to report, to
those not already in the know, that Carol Laula is a major homegrown
talent that should be listened to, seen, and indeed highly praised for
all aspects of her obvious crowd-pleasing attributes?
We are continually exposed through the media to new talent from around
the world. Sheryl Crow, to whom Carol is likened, along with Perhaps k d
lang and Nancy Griffiths are good examples.
Perhaps if our local media spent more time saying what they actually
felt it might be Carol Laula, or indeed other worthy Scots entertainers,
whom we would hear on the radio, see on the television, and ultimately

MICHAEL Campbell, the 25-year-old New Zealander of Maori parentage, is
a distinctive figure not only for the heavily-tinted sports glasses he
wears to protect his eyes from glare and ''stop me getting wrinkles'' or
the whale-bone carving which dangles from his neck as a good-luck charm.
It is just possible that Campbell and a compatriot, Philip Tataurangi,
will reinforce golf's faltering attempts to relieve the game of the
impression that it is the exclusive property of the WASP.
Tataurangi qualified to play on the US Tour, but last year lost his
card and failed to regain it last autumn. He now toils in the obscurity
of the subsidiary Nike Tour. In contrast, Campbell has chosen a rather
more measured route to the game's upper reaches and, indeed, his
considered progress seems to reflect the canny side of his Scottish
great-great-great grandfather, who in 1864 emigrated to the Land of the
Silver Fern.
A doctor by profession, Logan Campbell, who became mayor of Auckland
and was subsequently knighted, took to wife two Maori women, hence the
golfer's descendancy. Michael's father, Thomas, played golf at Titahi
Bay, near Wellington, a nine-hole course where sheep and cattle roam the
fairways and the greens are protected by fencing. Campbell recalled: ''I
used to get mince pies and milk shakes for caddieing for him, and if it
rained, five dollars more.''
The 11-year-old was initially taught by his father, who played off
three. ''He was good, but not as good as he thought he was,'' the son
says of the father, somewhat uncharitably. But other sports interested
Michael -- soft ball and, almost instinctively for a New Zealander,
rugby, at which he represented Wellington in the under-16 side. But
these activities interfered at weekends with golf and, having discussed
the dilemma with his father, Michael decided that golf offered the best
prospect for a career in sport.
That choice began to become seriously justified with the arrival from
England of Mal Tongue six years ago to be the professional at the Manor
Park club in Wellington. In 1992, the pivotal year for Campbell, he won
the Australian amateur championship and, as he put it: ''I felt I had
reached the pinnacle of my amateur career and turned professional the
following year.'' The immediate results were, to put it mildly, full of
the promise which has developed, more or less steadily, ever since.
Campbell finished seventh in his first professional tournament, in
Melbourne, second in his second outing, and gained his first victory at
only the fourth attempt. But from that peak he sagged into a sharp
decline. ''I went from one extreme to the other,'' he reflected. ''I had
a bad patch for six months, missing the cut in all the five tournaments
I played in Europe. But the experience was useful, for it taught me just
how mean and hard the game of golf can be.''
A year later came another transformation, this time positive and, by
the looks of things, more permanent. Campbell failed to pre-qualify for
the US Open, but in the same week as the championship was played
Campbell won the Nike Tour event in St Louis. He then returned to Europe
and in the next two weeks won the Challenge Tour events in Switzerland
and Austria. Eventually he finished third in the Challenge order of
merit, thereby gaining exemption into the regular Tour.
Campbell was 16 when, rather as Nick Faldo took to golf after having
watched Jack Nicklaus on television, he saw Greg Norman win the 1986
Open Championship at Turnberry and adopted the Australian as his first
role-model. ''I thought then it would be good to play alongside him,''
Campbell recalled. ''But there were New Zealanders to look up to, too --
Bob Charles, of course, although he's generations ahead of mine, but
also Frank Nobilo and Greg Turner, whom I'm actually competing directly
against now.''
Winning in Europe this season is Campbell's immediate goal, part of
the preparation for his attempt to qualify for the US Tour, maybe in two
or three years' time.
Campbell, like any aspiring professional, is critical of aspects of
his game. ''The strongest part is from tee to green,'' he considers
''and my chipping is good. However, my holing out could do with
improvement.''
Watching him play the first nine holes of the third round of the Dubai
Desert Classic, and his joint-third finish, convinced this admirer not
only of Campbell's all-round ability but of a temperament which responds
confidently and adeptly to pressure shots. Definitely one from Down
Under with the potential to put One Over.

THE latest cruel complexity to emerge from Ulster's 25 years of
suffering concerns the future of a young British paratrooper, Private
Clegg, who shot and killed an even younger joyrider, who was a passenger
in a car which did not stop at an Army checkpoint Pte Clegg and others
were manning. Under existing law Pte Clegg could not have been charged
with manslaughter; had he been a civilian such a charge would have been
possible, but as a soldier, murder was the appropriate charge, carrying
a mandatory life sentence in case of conviction. He was indeed
convicted, and that decision has been upheld by the House of Lords.
There are now claims that new evidence is available, and that the case
should be reopened in Northern Ireland. There is, separately, the hope
that the law should be changed so that soldiers placed in Pte Clegg's
position in future will not meet the same legal challenge; but legal
changes are not normally held to operate retrospectively, and in this
case would not affect Pte Clegg.
The case is ferocious enough, quite apart from the general point about
the dilemma involved in arming troops but ensuring that they never
become trigger-happy. Nineteen bullets hit the car. Pte Clegg fired four
and one of his hit the girl, as did some others (the driver was also
killed). It was not entirely a cut-and-dried affair even in the
soldiers' minds, for they engaged in a clumsy cover-up immediately. Lots
of possibilities force themselves on anyone considering the evidence.
None is conclusive but one factor must always be borne in mind -- the
soldiers, of the Parachute regiment, were on an anti-joyriding
operation, not an anti-IRA one. That distinction is vital. Although the
car involved might have been operating on behalf of the IRA, the Paras
do not seem to have thought that it was, and they did not respond to it
as if it was.
There are bound to be differing and conflicting perceptions of this
tragic affair, and its reopening now must focus attention on its
possible impact on the peace negotiations, which remain fragile. That
aspect is, however, really irrelevant to the rights and wrongs of the
case, though it will remind everyone at once of the way in which Irish
nationalists have come to believe that they do not get justice from
British law. This is, however, only one political dimension of the case.
The straightforward attempt to get Pte Clegg's sentence effectively
overturned and himself released until a new judgment emerges is an
overwhelming attempt to steamroller public opinion, and the Government,
in one direction. Mr Major has been cautious about supporting this
movement, but a large number of his back benchers (and the leader of the
Liberal Democrats) have already done so. They are in danger of making
themselves judge and jury, though without the benefit of reconsidering
all the evidence formally, since they have already proclaimed their
decision.
This is a powerfully emotive affair, never the best atmosphere for
dispassionate judgment. Pte Clegg will get his re-trial, but it does not
seem at once (unless there is indeed new evidence) that his release will
follow automatically.

A Herald investigation of a #3.4 Iraqi contract by a Midlothian-based
company, Global Technology, revealed how it was used as a cover to allow
Saddam Hussein to restock his arms arsenal in the run-up to the Gulf
War. Details were passed to the Arms-to-Iraq Inquiry -- at the request
of Lord Justice Scott -- last year.
The investigation, in 1990, uncovered evidence of Government
complicity in arms trading with the regime. The British Embassy in
Baghdad was aware of the contract, which involved the transfer of
sophisticated naval weaponry used against the allies in the conflict.
Now new evidence has been uncovered which shows, for the first time,
how acoustic detonators were adapted by the Iraqis for use as
sophisticated naval weapons which gave them the capability to blow up
enemy ships by remote control. Margaret Vaughan reports.
KELSO RIDDLE is the missing link in the bizarre chain that led from a
tatty office in Midlothian to the bloody conflict of the Gulf war.
It was Mr Riddle who welcomed the flamboyant figure of Allan Mellor
into his Edinburgh office in 1990. Mellor and a friend, Mel Blackburn,
had signed a #3.4m deal to clear the strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway in
southern Iraq of war debris. They wanted Mr Riddle's company, Oceano
Instruments UK, to provide 10 acoustic detonators. These were to be used
to clear old mines littering the seabed, Mellor said.
Percipiently, perhaps, Mr Riddle did not fully trust Mellor. He asked
for money up front. Instead he got a bank guarantee. It was enough to
convince him to accept the contract. He flew to his firm's factory and
development arm, on the outskirts of Paris, and arranged for the
acoustic detonators to be made.
Mellor, who described himself as a marine consultant, had a colourful
past. His previous ventures included setting up the San Jose project, to
raise gold, silver and precious stones from four sunken wrecks off the
coast of Colombia in South America. Now he was involved with Blackburn
in a scheme that promised to make both men rich.
Blackburn, a sharp salesman with a liking for medallions and heavy
gold rings, had become a good friend to the Iraqis during their
eight-year war with Iran. He was a Mr Fixit for the regime, and boasted
of setting up contracts with European companies for Iraq, earning his
10% and the gratitude and trust of the coterie surrounding Saddam
Hussein.
His mentor was a member of one of the small group of influential
families within the presidential palace. Colonel Nofal was the key
player in Iraq's arms procurement network.
His contact in the UK was Omar Latif, a suave man who ostensibly ran
Iraqi Airlines but who was Saddam's senior intelligence officer in the
UK.
With the ending of the Iran/Iraq hostilities in August 1988, the Iraqi
regime wanted to encourage international shipping back to its ports. It
wanted to rebuild its oil terminals badly damaged in the war. More than
200 kilometres of waterways were littered with war debris, including
wrecks of military vessels and Iranian mines.
Crucially, it was also intent on restocking its war arsenal.
When Blackburn signed the deal, unusually for him, it was not on the
basis of taking a cut and finding somebody else to do it. He decided to
oversee the contract himself. He brought Mellor in, as his marine
consultant.
The men had trouble finding financial backers in this country. They
approached a number of firms specialising in diving systems, survey
systems and underwater remote robots, to become involved.
Aberdeen-based Oceaneering and Clearway Explosives agreed to go to
Iraq to find out what equipment was needed. The list included
sophisticated navigation systems and acoustic detonators.
Blackburn and Mellor approached the Resource Group, to the firm's
later cost, who agreed to invest heavily in the contract, providing men
and equipment for surveying and training.
The hydrographic survey company, at Global's request, entertained a
team of Iraqi armed forces officers at their offices in March 1990.
The Resource Group, like most other suppliers on the contract, never
received payment for their work. The firm was forced into receivership.
There were major problems, too, on the ground for contract workers
based at Basra. It was becoming, by all accounts, too much for Blackburn
and Mellor to handle.
The Iraqi navy were complaining that the remote control robot to track
down mines didn't work: the men on the job, some of whom were former
Special Boat Squadron divers, complained that their wages never arrived.
Still, with his bank guarantee to reassure him, Kelso Riddle finally
came up with the goods. He knew that they could not be sent direct from
France to Iraq, because of the arms embargo. So he rang his contact at
the Department of Trade and Industry and told him the acoustic
detonators were being imported into the UK, before being sent on to
Iraq. He asked whether he needed an export licence. He had, he claims, a
number of discussions with his contact at the DTI.
Eventually, he was told a licence was necessary. He decided he would
dispense with the paperwork and told his DTI contact Global would apply
for it.
He telexed Allan Mellor at Global to tell him the DTI licences were
needed. Mellor gave Oceano a written assurance that detonators would not
be sold to Iraq.
Riddle says that he delivered the first part of the consignment, the
control unit for the detonator, to Mellor's home at Lasswade in
Midlothian. The rest went straight from Paris to a cargo shed at
Heathrow Airport.
Unusually, he says, he heard no more from the company about the
detonators. He would have expected a call, but it did not come. He
began, he claims, to wonder whether the detonators were being put to the
defensive use for which Mellor had claimed they were needed.
Over the next four months, he says, he raised his fears with contacts
at the Ministry of Defence.
Eventually, he was contacted by Customs and Excise officers, and
although he is reluctant to fill in the full details -- he was flown to
the Gulf in 1991 where he helped Royal Naval mine clearance specialists
to locate and destroy the detonators. They were, as he feared, adapted
to trigger massive mines by remote control.
The size of the explosions were, he says, stunning. The mines were
huge. They would have blown an enemy boat out of the water. Not all were
located.
Riddle says he has made all his paperwork and office files available
to Customs and Excise. He has not, though, been contacted by the Scott
Inquiry, as he expected. Customs officers did investigate Mellor and
Blackburn. In 1991, the Herald was told a planned prosecution was not
proceeding. No reason was given.
The Government conceded that the embassy in Baghdad was aware of the
contract. Indeed, Blackburn and Mellor claim they made no secret of it.
Omar Latif, the man they boasted of as a close friend, was expelled
from Britain after he was suspected of being involved in a plot to
smuggle nuclear triggers from the US to Baghdad via the UK.
He was, it emerged, Saddam's spymaster. He was also the man who
smoothed the way for Global's consignments of cargo for the contract
through Heathrow Airport.
Global Technology no longer exists. Its Midlothian office is no longer
in use.
Mr Mellor and Mr Blackburn are understood to be involved in contracts
overseas.

Bridging medicine's East-West divide: Ann Shaw discusses the growing
popularity of Chinese medicine as a complement to Western orthodoxy with
Dr Kun Wang
WHILE Western medicine has made enormous progress over the past 50
years -- becoming increasingly hi-tech, with its armoury of drugs and
complex surgery -- a growing minority of people are turning to
alternative medicines, particularly from China.
Chinese medicine has a record of success in treating a range of
conditions -- considered by Western practitioners to have a large
emotional and psychosomatic content -- such as migraine, asthma, and
skin disorders.
For instance, take a roomful of people and expose them to an influenza
strain. Some will succumb to the disease and others will not. Why?
Where a Western doctor may fail to find a physical cause for this, ask
a Chinese doctor and the answer is simple: those whose lives are ''out
of balance'', for whatever reason, are more prone to disease than those
who are in tune with their environment.
In China, Western medicine has a role to play too, alongside
traditional medicine, says Dr Kun Wang, who practises as an NHS surgeon
in Edinburgh and also practises Chinese medicine in the private sector.
He is, therefore, in a unique position to evaluate both.
''Since the early 80s there has been an increasing interest in the
West in Chinese medicine and it is the single most popular topic studied
by foreign students in China,'' said Dr Wang.
He points out that Western medicine has clearly defined parameters
based on research, theories, principles, methods, and standardised
testing. Chinese medicine, on the other hand, adopts a more
philosophical approach with the emphasis on the balance between man and
nature.
Whereas Western medicine is based on scientific experimentation,
Chinese medicine is based on two books transcribed 2000 years ago, the
accumulation of over 5000 years of medical practice. For treatment
Chinese medicine relies on acupuncture, massage, and herbal medicines.
It also reflects a different way of thinking from Western medicine;
for example, in their differing methods of clinical diagnosis. A
Western-trained doctor will arrive at a diagnosis based on clinical
observation and tests whereas a Chinese one will reach a conclusion
based on observation, smell, questioning, and your pulse rate.
Where Western medicine looks for a cause, or a causal agent eg an
individual virus or bacteria, Chinese medicine will try to establish a
more diffuse causation which takes into account the mental state of the
patient, their environment, lifestyle, and anything which may have
resulted in imbalance.
The central emphasis at all times is on the restoration of the balance
in the individual's life -- not, as in Western medicine, the eradication
of a particular agent said to have caused the disease.
As Dr Wang put it, quoting a Chinese proverb: ''Wherever there is
sickness there is a loss of balance.''
The effects of treatment also differ between Western and Chinese
medicine.
Most, if not all, Western drugs, even aspirin, carry side-effects. Yet
there appear to be no known side-effects from Chinese medicines, many of
which have been in use for thousands of years. And unlike many Western
drugs, there also appears to be no record of anyone building up a
resistance to Chinese medicines.
But doesn't Chinese herbal medicines smell, and taste, awful? True,
said Dr Wang. ''We have a Chinese saying: 'Good medicine always has a
bad taste'.''
Dr Wang emphasised that more and more people are finding that there is
a place for both Western and Chinese medicine in today's world -- that
one can complement the other.
* Dr Kun Wang can be contacted through Edinburgh Natural Health Centre
on 031-313 5434.
No longer under my skin
CHINESE CURE 1
* DUNCAN Blythe has suffered from eczema and asthma all his life.
Therefore, when he found himself sitting in the Edinburgh Natural Health
Centre in front of a Chinese doctor who promised to cure him he was
extremely sceptical.
''Like so many people I had seen before, he said he would be able to
help. Quite frankly, I didn't believe him,'' said the 20-year-old
Edinburgh maths student. A week later he was cured.
''It's a miracle. I still can't believe it,'' admitted Blythe. That
was more than six weeks ago but he still checks the mirror every morning
hardly able to believe that the eczema which had plagued him since he
was a toddler had cleared up.
So, what's the treatment? ''I have acupuncture every two weeks and I
have to boil up a bag of Chinese herbs twice a day. Also, I've been
given some cream to put on if my skin gets itchy.''
And the cost? Blythe confessed he thought it expensive at first -- #30
a visit plus another #35 for the herbs. ''On the other hand it's been a
worthwhile investment. I've spent hundreds of pounds in one year alone
on ointments and creams. Nothing worked,'' said Blythe, a student at
Heriot-Watt University. His first foray into alternative medicine had
been his mother's idea. She was given Dr Kun Wang's name while attending
a health seminar and persuaded her son to give it a try.
Blythe has not had an attack of asthma since he started the Chinese
treatment. He added: ''My family and friends can't believe the change in
me. All this happened just before Christmas, so I had a really great
time over the holidays. Best ever.''
Herb tea for taste of the good life
CHINESE CURE 2
* COLLETTE THAIN, an Edinburgh accountant, had to give up her job a
year ago because she suffered from extreme fatigue. Sometimes just
getting out of bed in the morning and having a shower exhausted her.
Doctors could find nothing wrong. As a working mother with a demanding
job her tiredness was dismissed as stress. She left her job but got
worse. ''It would come over me in waves, even lifting a cup of coffee
would be too much.''
Then, while on holiday in Ireland, she was rushed to hospital with
pneumonia. Eventually, she was brought back to the Eastern General in
Edinburgh and liver disease diagnosed.
Thain recalls how she learned the true nature of her illness. The
consultant rang her husband, a lawyer, and told him: ''Your wife is
suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis. It's untreatable.'' The
consultant added that if her condition really deteriorated then she
would be considered for a liver transplant.
Not surprisingly Thain was horrified: ''Neither of us had ever heard
of the disease. We had no idea what caused it.'' But she is a determined
and highly intelligent woman: ''I refused to sit back and accept it.
Some years before I had been treated by a Chinese doctor, who is also a
surgeon, Dr Kun Wang, for a back injury. So I thought it worth a try.
''Immediately he started me on a treatment of Chinese herb teas, pills
and powders along with acupuncture.'' That was last August. ''He told me
that provided I stuck to his regime for two years I would not need a
liver transplant.'' Part of the treatment also involves a change in
diet. Coffee and alcohol are forbidden along with all cold foods, orange
juice, and tomatoes and she says: ''My taste has changed. I can't bear
to eat processed foods.''
She is convinced she owes her health to Dr Kun Wang. ''Without Chinese
medicine I would be an invalid,'' says Thain, who also attends the liver
unit at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, the only one of its kind in Scotland.
There they offer her information, support, and regularly monitor her
blood level -- ''It's almost back to normal. All my specialist will say
is that he is happy and satisfied with my condition.''
Today Thain is an energetic fund-raiser for the British Liver Trust
and says: ''At last I have the energy to do things. There are an awful
lot of misconceptions about liver disease, especially that it's
something you've brought on yourself through alcohol, which is not true:
I don't drink.''
She would like more information on the disease to be readily
available: ''Many people suffer from it, although more than 95% of
sufferers are women, but if a woman goes along to her GP complaining of
fatigue she is told, 'You run a home, a family, and go out to work. No
wonder you are tired'. If you don't work, then you are told you are
tired because you are bored. Women are often in a no-win situation.''
Primary biliary cirrhosis affects mainly women and is difficult to
diagnose because early symptoms, which can go on for years, are vague.
It is characterised by fatigue, itchiness, and a yellow skin. The cause
is unknown although it is believed to have a genetic component.
* The Liver Support group, run by Sister Ruth Miller, meets on the
first Wednesday of each month in the Medical Outpatients Department,
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, from 7.30-9pm. It offers support and
information on all liver diseases. Newcomers welcome. Contact Sister
Ruth Miller on Ward 39 (tel: 0131-536 1139).

<TEXT>
THE Government yesterday denied it has made any further offer of money
towards the failed Health Care International hospital at Clydebank.
However, Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton told the
Commons there was no reason in principle why the balance of an existing
cash offer could not be transferred to a new operator -- if certain
conditions were met.
A Scottish Office letter leaked to a Sunday newspaper claimed the Abu
Dhabi Investment Company, in final stages of talks with receivers of the
HCI private hospital, could expect up to #4.4m in regional assistance if
the hospital thrived and met pre-set employment targets.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson challenged Lord James:
''This hotel, HCI, survived Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's official
opening for only 110 days before going into liquidation.''
Mr Robertson said: ''Is it also not a fact that 80% of the
multi-million pound regional assistance that was given to HCI was given
on the basis of only a third of the jobs that were promised in that
time?
''So what possible defence can you give for adding another #4.4m of
taxpayers' money to the financial drainpipe of HCI, other than that it's
going to be a sweetener to those who are already going to get a bargain
basement deal with a hospital without debt -- costing all of the country
#180m -- or as an expensive face-saver for Mr Lang after this fiasco of
the decade?''
Lord James replied: ''You're not correct in saying it cost the country
#180m -- #30m was committed from the public sector and #150m from the
private sector.
''No further offer of assistance has been made.
''But there is no reason in principle why the balance of the existing
offer should not be transferred to a new operator, subject to
appropriate conditions.''

ROYAL Caledonian Curling Club president Inglis McAulay has maintained
the ruling body's harsh line on the non-acceptance of 1991 world junior
champion James Dryburgh's entry to the Macallan Scottish Championship
district play-downs this weekend in Aberdeen, Ayr, Glasgow, and Perth.
Last week, as exclusively reported in The Herald, the RCCC deemed that
Dryburgh and another team, skipped by Len Gow, would not be accepted as
they had not followed the correct procedures.
Gow had entered at the Lagoon Centre in Paisley and his completed form
reached the RCCC by fax on November 3 -- four days before the RCCC's
closing date.
In Dryburgh's case, the 20-year-old Edinburgh student handed his entry
into the Royal Club's offices in the capital at the end of October. Only
the week before last -- 10 weeks later -- did he discover, after several
enquiries, that he wasn't in the draw.
Dryburgh asked: ''Why did they accept the entry if it wasn't valid,
and why didn't they tell me before this?''
McAulay accepts that the Royal Club were tardy in informing Dryburgh's
rink and admitted: ''It might have been a courtesy to tell them.''
Last weekend competitions convener Alex Torrance spoke to Dryburgh and
confirmed that he was out, even although he had previously hinted that
he might be reinstated if there were withdrawals.
But McAulay confirmed yesterday that -- despite at least one pull-out
from the play-downs -- Dryburgh would not be recalled. He said: ''They
can argue till the cows come home, but their entry wasn't valid.''
Dryburgh described the Royal Club's maladministration of the entries
as ''an absolute disgrace.''
David Ramsay, president of the Curlers' Association, set up two
seasons ago to represent the players, said: ''While there remains this
level of error about the Royal Club's handling of the Dryburgh team's
entry, they should certainly reinstate them.''

THE President of the Board of Trade, Mr Heseltine, remains committed
to privatising the Post Office. There is no chance of that being done
before the next election since enough of his present colleagues oppose
it. After that election, the future of the Post Office depends entirely
on the outcome; Labour will retain it in the public sector. That still
leaves it in a limbo now, since the present management believe that they
need a new and substantial capital injection if the business is to seize
new opportunities and protect existing activities from vigorous
international competitors (particularly, and ironically, the newly
privatised Dutch Post). Mr Heseltine admires such managerial drive but
believes that the business must accept the disciplines of a public
corporation, which apparently involve no more money now.
That must be a short-sighted view. Mr Heseltine can be forgiven if he
feels bruised by what was a notable political defeat last year when his
privatisation plans were decisively rejected by a handful of Tory back
benchers. That loss deprived the Government of a large bit of its
programme, but there seems no reason why it should also deprive the Post
Office of access to new sources of revenue, quite apart from extra
income generated by increasing the cost of letters. That last move
really needs judicious consideration given that the Dutch are not the
only aggressive competitors. The Government is in danger of being in the
huff -- sulking in its tent as an opponent put it -- because of losing
its case inside its own party.
It is true that a state-owned body cannot borrow without increasing
public borrowing, which the Government is desperately trying to reduce.
There are, however, lots of other sophisticated financial instruments,
including joint ventures and the private funding of public enterprises
(thought of by Norman Lamont and pioneered by Hambros Bank). Exploiting
such devices would make the Post Office more of a hybrid than a pure
public corporation, but that might be a solution which would satisfy
everyone interested in postal services and their delivery to customers.
The PO management would find their new projects possible without a
switch of ownership, the Government could be smug about the businesses'
growth without further public money, and Labour could be happy with the
prospect of public services remaining available without requiring extra
financing by taxpayers. If, however, that strategy does not work, the
Government should go on financing the Royal Mail without making it
dearer. The Post Office is already a very lucrative business which,
arguably, is paying too much of its profits to the Treasury. More needs
to be diverted to new investment, the very message the Government is
preaching all the time. Were the Post Office a private company it would
certainly retain more of its cash flow to fund growth. It needs to start
now.

Singapore, Wednesday
SINGER Cliff Richard favours strict discipline, including
Singapore-style caning, he told The Straits Times newspaper in an
interview published today.
The pop singer, 54, who was born in India, said his upbringing during
British colonial rule gave him a deep appreciation for the law, even if
enforcement included caning.
''If something is against the law, there must be some punishment.
Otherwise, don't have laws,'' the paper quoted him as saying.
''My father was a strict man. I remember coming home from school once
and I told him my teacher caned me. And my father caned me again,'' he
said.
Singapore's reliance on corporal punishment received worldwide
attention last year when authorities caned American teenager Michael Fay
who was convicted of vandalism.
Cliff told the paper that discipline, diet and obstinacy were key
factors in his 36 years of pop music success.
He credited his perennial youthfulness to a strict one-meal-a-day
diet, daily exercise and a healthy lifestyle.
''I use a good moisturising cream, herbal pills and, because I'm on a
diet, vitamins,'' he said.
He will give a concert here as part of his Hit List Tour.--PA.

AN unarmed man strangled an attacking wolf that had been terrorising a
Kazakh village, Tass news agency said today.
The lone wolf pounced on Samat Kenzhemurzayev as he returned from work
to the village of Kyzylsai, 300 miles northeast of the Kazakh capital of
Almaty.
Kenzhemurzayev first kicked the animal and then strangled it, the news
agency said. It also said Kenzhemurzayev, who works for a local oil
company, was well-known in the former Soviet region for his exceptional
strength.
The wolf had killed several domestic animals in Kyzylsai.--AP.

Washington, Wednesday
A FORMER Kentucky state Senator claimed today she had a year-long
affair with the civil rights leader, the Rev Martin Luther King, and was
with him at the Lorraine Motel the night before he was assassinated
there.
Georgia Powers reveals the relationship in her autobiography, I Shared
the Dream, and in an interview in a US newspaper today.
Martin Luther King was America's best-known black leader in the early
1960s.
The Rev Ralph Abernathy, King's lieutenant in the civil rights
movement, created a furore five years ago when he suggested in his
memoirs that King cheated on his wife.
Powers is apparently the first woman to say she had an affair with
him.
''The relationship between Martin Luther King Jr and I began with
mutual admiration,'' she writes. ''Gradually, our attachment grew
stronger until it passed beyond camaraderie into intimacy.''
A spokesman for King's widow, Coretta Scott King, said she and her son
Dexter were in South Korea on a visit on behalf of the King Centre and
were not available for comment.
In 1967, Powers became the first black person elected to the state
Senate in Kentucky. Her relationship with King began that year, she
said.--AP.

Los Angeles, Wednesday
JUDGE Lance Ito today lifted his ban on live television coverage of
the O.J. Simpson trial after a TV network apologised for making a major
error in allowing a juror's face to be inadvertently shown.
His decision cleared the way for the defence to make its opening
statement a day after prosecutors laid down their case that a trail of
blood leading from the crime scene to a sock in Simpson's bedroom proved
that the former football star murdered his former wife Nicole Brown
Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Ito accepted Court TV's apology for accidentially showing an alternate
juror's face for eight-tenths of a second during its live feed of the
prosecution case yesterday.
He praised the cable's station's courage and professionalism for
admitting its mistake so swiftly.
But Robert Shapiro, an attorney for Simpson, complained that his
client's right to a fair trial had been damaged because the flap over
coverage prevented the defence from immediately launching into its case.
That meant the jury went home last night after hearing only the
prosecution case and its contention that Simpson murdered his wife as a
final act of trying to control her.
When Court-TV made the mistake, Ito fumed in court: ''My credibility
as a judge is at stake . . . our friends in the media, thank you
again.''
Ito had ordered that the identities of the 12 jurors and the 10
alternates be kept secret to guard their safety. In addition, California
law bars cameras in courtrooms from showing jurors.
In his ruling today, Ito allowed resumed coverage as long as the
camera showed only a fixed shot and did not pan across the room showing
people's reactions.
''The cameras are the only thing keeping this trial honest,'' said
Theo Wilson, a now-retired veteran trial reporter for the New York Daily
News. She said that without the cameras viewers and newspaper readers
would be subjected to dozens of different interpretations and spins.
Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark, in a classic prosecutorial
presentation, told a rapt jury in her opening statement that the DNA
tests showed a ''trail of blood'' belonging to Simpson and his alleged
victims leading from the murder scene to his car and finally to his
house.
She said a glove found on Simpson's grounds was stained with his blood
as well as that of Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman.
Its match was found at the murder scene two miles away.
''The mere fact that we find blood where there should be no blood in
the defendant's house, in the driveway, in his car and in a sock at the
foot of his bed, that trail of blood . . . is devastating proof of his
guilt,'' Clark told jurors.
But instead of the defence getting a chance to counter Clark's
arguments, Ito sent the jury home in the flap over news media coverage.
Simpson's lawyers are waiting for a chance to tell the court and the
world that DNA testing is not fool-proof and that the Los Angeles Police
Department so fouled up the handling of the evidence that nothing they
say can be believed.--Reuter.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang was caught up in a new row yesterday over
relief for the victims of the recent flooding in parts of Strathclyde.
He announced #2.7m in additional resources for housing expenditure in
areas affected by the floods, but some Labour MPs demanded more action
on prevention rather than cure.
It also emerged that the cash is not new money but is being
reallocated from the existing Scottish block.
Mr Lang told the Commons: ''My department now has received initial
estimates from Renfrew and Strathkelvin districts of the costs to their
housing programmes of remedial work related to the flooding.
In light of these estimates, I will make an additional #2.5m of
capital consent available to the councils when the housing capital
allocations for 1995-96 are announced next week, over and above the
resources which would otherwise have been allocated.
''#2m will go to Renfrew District and #500,000 to Strathkelvin. In
addition, last month I indicated that I would be prepared to consider
requests from other councils to cover urgent repairs. Glasgow District
Council have requested #200,000 for this purpose and I have agreed to
that.
''It remains open to other councils facing a requirement for urgent
repairs this year to make appropriate bids if they need to.
''Added to the steps already taken by the Government this brings the
level of resources we have provided so far in response to the flooding
to #5.5m.''
Paisley South Labour MP Gordon McMaster said last night that the money
was welcome as far as it went but it appeared to be borrowing consent
rather than cash aid. He added: ''It does not affect flood prevention
and that is the big issue with people now.''
Mr Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, said in the
Commons that his constituents were convinced one of the reasons for the
recent flooding was failure to dredge the lower Kelvin and the upper
Clyde.
He challenged Mr Lang: ''Will you therefore fund a study to look at
the contribution to the flooding of the non-dredging of the Clyde and,
if it is shown to have been a contributory factor, fund the necessary
restructuring work to prevent it ever happening again?''
Mr Lang replied: ''The Government is willing to consider all such
studies that are put to it by the relevant regional authorities, and has
already undertaken to contribute to the funding of a study by the Clyde
River Purification Board.''
However, because of the lie of the land, he doubted if the Clyde
itself could be a cause of flooding in Strathkelvin.
VICTIMS of the recent floods in Strathclyde will receive a second
round of cash payments from the Strathclyde Regional
Council-administered hardship fund over the next few weeks.
The balance of the fund, which now stands at #543 000, will be paid
out to victims ''as quickly as possible'', said councillor Dr David
Sanderson, chair of the fund supervisory committee.

SCOTS campaigning for increased Government funding for breast cancer
research and treatment are to extend their efforts into England and
Wales.
The Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign has gathered over 150,000
signatures in Scotland in support of its demands and will present the
petition at 10 Downing Street on February 7.
Afterwards, a deputation will lobby MPs at Westminster to recruit
all-party support for the cause.
Mrs Audrey Jones, who chairs the campaign, said yesterday: ''Every day
in Scotland, seven women die of breast cancer and the campaign's
research has shown that statistics in England and Wales are even worse.
''Our aim now is to go national and we hope groups in England and
Wales will join our fight so that at last something is done.''
Mrs Jones, herself a breast cancer sufferer, added: ''In the US, a
similar campaign succeeded in diverting $210m away from the defence
budget to breast cancer research. This is the result we want.''
She launched the campaign last summer because of the number of women
dying from the disease, and breast cancer research being largely
dependent on charitable donations.
The campaign has the backing of the Leith Labour MP, Mr Malcolm
Chisholm, chairman of the all-party committee on breast cancer, who
said: ''This massive petition shows the strength of feeling in Scotland
on this issue.

BOARD of Trade President Michael Heseltine yesterday sought to
resurrect his failed attempt to privatise the Royal Mail and suggested
to MPs he would be vindicated eventually.
It was the only way to make the business ''world-class'' -- despite
the ''tragedy'' of his being forced last year by MPs' and public
pressure to abandon privatisation plans.
He was giving evidence to the Trade and Industry Select Committee,
which had heard earlier from Post Office chiefs pleading for more
commercial freedom to enable them to compete.
Their evidence included a warning from chairman Michael Heron that the
cost of sending a letter would go up unless the Post Office was given
greater commercial freedom.
It was vital to take the service forward, give it greater freedom, and
establish a ''new enterprise culture'', Mr Heron said.
Mr Heseltine insisted that, contrary to reports, he was continuing the
dialogue with the Post Office about its future and was seeking to lift
constraints where possible to allow greater commercial freedom. However,
he showed scant enthusiasm and emphasised it could be several months
before he would be in a position to make specific recommendations.
Committee chairman Richard Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central,
said the Post Office had now been ''under somewhat of a cloud for
two-and-a-half years'' because of uncertainty about its future. ''That
instablity is a problem to managers. The quicker we can resolve that the
better it would be,'' he said.
Mr Heseltine replied: ''Yes, but I doubt if we are going to be able to
resolve it, because the right solution is to enable Royal Mail to become
a world-class company.''
That was what was happening in other nations and it was still the best
solution for the Royal Mail. Then people would be amazed at its success.
Labour Industry spokesman Brian Wilson accused Mr Heseletine of
behaving like a spoilt child and described his performance as ''petulant
and entirely negative'' in refusing to recognise the case for greater
commercial freedom for the PO within the public sector.
Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the Union of Communication
Workers, criticised the time Mr Heseltine was taking to decide the Post
Office's future. ''The Post Office is used to delivering quickly and on
time. If Mr Heseltine worked for the Royal Mail, he would have been
sacked a long time ago,'' he said.
A WARNING that rural postal services will be at risk if Royal Mail is
not given commercial freedom was given in Aberdeen yesterday by Mr John
Mackay, director and general manager for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Addressing Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, he said: ''What we urgently
need is real commercial freedom to meet the rapidly growing
competition.''
He said that as a result of the Government's decision they were no
further forward now than they were two-and-a-half years ago and that was
''a disgrace''.

to the unstinting generosity of readers.
The latest boost for our campaign for the setting up of a special
investigative clinic at the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow to mark its
bi-centenary came in the form of an anonymous #100 donation from a Fife

The campaign got off to flying start with a generous gift of #5000
from Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden. Donations from readers -- #11,219 --
make up the single largest source of our funds. About two-thirds of
these are anonymous.
Our Betty Boothroyd luncheon raised #7642 including #1755 from the
raffle, our Citroen competition raised #1230 and, finally, just under a
#1000 came from our Spanish wine evening.
A special ''thank-you'' must be made to the groups and organisations
working energetically on our behalf, such as the Parkhead Congregational
Church Women's Fellowship, Glasgow, who kindly gifted #129.
Many more groups have contacted us to say they also have plans for
fund-raising events to help towards our #100,000 target.

A SCOTTISH doctor yesterday was given a six-month prison sentence,
with hard labour, for causing the death of two young patients in
Zimbabwe.
Dr Richard McGown was still at liberty last night, but will return to
the High Court in Harare today to hear whether he can remain on bail
pending an appeal to the country's Supreme Court against his conviction
and sentence.
The 58-year-old anaesthetist had denied two charges of culpable
homicide, in a case which has provoked serious racial divisions in
Zimbabwe.
McGown, who was educated in Glasgow and Edinburgh, was found guilty of
giving excessive doses of morphine during routine operations on a
20-month-old Asian boy and a 10-year-old black girl. He had been
acquitted on three other charges.
Judge Paddington Garwe said yesterday that McGown had been guilty of
gross negligence and a two-year jail term would have been appropriate.
However, he decided on a one-year sentence, with six months suspended,
because of a long delay in bringing the matter to court and ''adverse''
publicity about the case which had harmed McGown's career. He also
imposed a fine of 10,000 Zimbabwean dollars (#770).
The judge said: ''I find nothing to suggest he feels any remorse. We
find a prison and labour sentence appropriate . . . because of the
sanctity of life.''
McGown, he said, had committed gross negligence in 1988 by releasing
an Asian toddler, Kalpesh Nagindas, from hospital after administering a
high dose of morphine during a circumcision operation. The boy choked on
vomit in his parents' bed after suffering respiratory problems.
The judge said that, if kept in hospital under observation, the boy
would have survived.
McGown also was convicted of the culpable homicide of Lavender
Khaminwa in 1990, who died several hours after having her appendix
removed. A post-mortem examination revealed that she had died from
respiratory depression and swelling of the brain.
After sentence was passed, McGown left court by a rear door and fled
from a group of 30 university students who were protesting at the
outcome. He later declined to discuss the case.
Student leader Obey Mudzingwa said the sentence was too light for
''someone who took children's lives''. Some of the students waved
placards calling for the death sentence which is still in force in
Zimbabwe.
Mr Charles Khaminwa, the dead girl's father, also claimed the sentence
was too lenient. ''You get five years for stealing a cow,'' he said of
the country's cattle-rustling laws, ''and six months for stealing the
lives of children. There has been no justice here.''
Defence lawyer Chris Anderson said his client was appealing to the
Supreme Court because the High Court had ''erred by not taking into
account McGown's vast experience''. The anaesthetist claims he has used
morphine to treat thousands of patients, of all races, with no adverse
effects.
Zimbabwe's Attorney General, Patrick Chinamasa, opposed both
applications for continued bail and for leave to appeal, and repeated
his description of McGown as ''a messenger of death stalking our
hospitals''.
McGown was born in India, of Scots parents. The family returned to
Scotland when he was two and he went to Glasgow Academy and later to
Edinburgh University where, in 1959, he graduated in medicine.
He trained as an anaesthetist in Sweden and, after shorts periods in
Scotland, Barbados and Zambia, moved to the then Rhodesia in 1968 with
his wife, Sheena, a nurse from Aberdeen.
The couple have two sons, Rory, 21, and Callum, 19, students at Cape
Town University in South Africa, and a daughter, Macushula, 17.

FRAUDSTERS who might be thinking of operating phoney charities in
Scotland were warned yesterday by Scottish Minister of State Lord Fraser
of Carmyllie that their activities would be just as strictly monitored
as in England.
He said in the Lords that although the Charities Commisssion did not
operate in Scotland the recently established Scottish Charities Office
was operating well and in conjunction with the Scottish Office was well
able to ensure that charities operated properly.
He was responding to Lord Campbell of Croy (Con.) who said the
Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations was very concerned that
''unwelcome people'' might be tempted to try to operate fraudulent
charities because of the different regulatory system in Scotland.

ONE of the more challenging tasks facing the President of the Board of
Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine -- who leads a trade mission to Japan
tomorrow -- will be to persuade his hosts to cut the tax on Scotch
whisky.
He said yesterday that there was ''an overwhelming case'' for a cut
and ''we would hope to make progress''.
His big problem is shochu, which Scotch producers view as a similar
though naturally less splendid beverage to their own. Because of its
traditional popularity in Japan, it is taxed at between four to six
times lower rates than Scotch.
Though quality counts, the tax differential does push the price of the
foreign product up and the whisky industry reckons it loses about #30m a
year as a result.
Mr Heseltine does, however, have a useful weapon to hand in the shape
of a Gatt ruling that Japan should eliminate the tax differentials
across all categories of distilled spirits.
Japanese ability to ignore such rulings or delay implementation is,
however, legendary and the home side still argues that shochu is a
''poor man's drink'' which cannot be taxed at the same rate as whisky,
bourbon, or brandy.
Mr Heseltine suggested that shochu is consumed so widely that its
nickname is misleading.
With Scotch sales to Japan dipping recently from the #2000m mark it
reached in 1993-94, Mr Heseltine said the Japanese already had made some
concessions to the industry ''but not enough''.
He will have Mr Hugh Morison, director-general of the Scotch Whisky
Assocation at his elbow during the talks.
A Department of Trade and Industry official suggested hopefully that
the Japanese could change their liquor tax rates in favour of Scotch in
a way that would be revenue-neutral for them. However, one suspects that
a strong shochu lobby may have beaten them to the ear of Japanese
Ministers.
He dismissed some rather crass questions about how much business
British industry could expect to get from the recent earthquake, saying:
''Nobody is taking a predatory view of what is a national tragedy.''
More than forty leading British businessmen will fly with Mr Heseltine
to Tokyo, including Mr D J McNeill, of Brown Brothers and Co, Rosebank
iron works, Edinburgh.

THIS enjoyable show reflects the upbeat tone which the NF Gallery set
on its refurbishment a year ago -- until February 5, Pam Carter and
Carol Moore share the space. Carter's love of colour stems from an East
African childhood and she still travels extensively as a wide Ohio
farmland panorama and Egyptian Mother Earth bear witness. However, Skye,
particularly Stein Bay and Waternish Peninsula, is her spiritual home.
She paints and exhibits there regularly, wallowing in the change of
perspective from clifftop to beach.
While it's good to see Carter getting away from her straightforward,
lush, painterly translations of landscapes, such as Kirkcaldy Beach,
Durness Dunes and Dunvegan Head, she has not quite resolved how to use
cross-cultural sign language. However, I much enjoyed the subtle
quartet, Jetsam, Mound, Storr Strata and Cuilins (all #220) where she
plays around with semi-abstract shapes in a most successful way.
Pastel is not an easy medium but Moore handles it superbly, creating
vivid patterns from conventional still-life arrangements of fruit and
flowers. I find her big setpieces such as Lilies or the loud Stripes and
Checks overcrowded. Value for money doesn't lie in quantity. For me her
subtle compositions win every time: grapes and plums you could eat and
an odd but pleasing array of Three Sunflowers.

MANY moons ago the Arts Diary suffered a telephonic bombardment from
Angus Farquhar, director of NVA, for daring to call Test Department, his
previous outfit, ''noise terrorists'' -- well, admittedly ''dubious
noise terrorists''. These days Farquhar is obviously happier to embrace
the terrorist tag. In the February issue of i-D, he asserts that ''to
me, an arts organisation should operate like a guerrilla outfit''.
Farquhar features in i-D magazine's ''New Faces; The Class of 1995''
compilation, listed alongside such style luminaries as Alexandra
Fletcher (Jacqui in Brookside), make-up artist Pat McGrath, and ace
snowboarder Will Hughes as one of the ''125 new faces who will make a
big impact this year; tomorrow's people setting the agenda for today''.
Farquhar -- 33-going-on-24 -- was duly gratified. ''It's only taken 15
years to be seen as a bright young thing.'' The only aspect he's unhappy
about is the posey pic of him which accompanies the gushy text, a
sentiment obviously not shared by i-D. Sharp-eyed Scots will spot that a
picture of Farquhar also illustrates a piece about the Edinburgh writer
Alan Warner.

THE crowds showing up at Suicide Notes, the controverisal exhibition

matter is endlessly fascinating. Indeed, suicide is to be the theme of
the next production by the Grassmarket Project -- they of the
Mad/Glad/Bad fame. Inspired by the disturbing fact that 23 young men
under the age of 25 committed suicide while in prison in the UK during
1994, The Family examines the impact a son's suicide has on his
relatives.
In typical Grassmarket Project style it will be a devised piece, based
on the first-hand experiences of 10 families who have lost a son through
suicide while in prison and will premier at this year's Edinburgh
Festival Fringe.
Flight of lovebirds
LOVE is in the air/Everywhere I look around. A heartening antidote to
depressing deathly thoughts is early enthusiasm for the annual lovefest
aka commercial-kill, Valentine's Day. Lovebirds of an artistic bent can
fly to Roger Billcliffe's fine art gallery in Glasgow to peruse
Valentines, a collection of paintings, watercolours, drawings, and
jewellery on a romantic theme, from Saturday to February 18, or, on the
evening itself, head to the Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh for The
Return of the Valentine Surprise!, where crooner Craig McMurdo will sing
some smoochy numbers.
Halliday job
The oreilles of the Arts Diary have heard rumours of an intriguing
example of entente-cordiale. Seems that Jim Prime, former keyboards
player with gone-but-unfortunately-not-forgotten-Deacon Blue, is heading
across the channel to work with France's premiere chanteur Johnny
Halliday, the greasy gallic smarmer of unmentionable years and
unfathomable popularity.
US friends
STUDENTS at Glasgow School of Art should be thanking Benny Hill.
Profits from his exploits are helping fund their studies. Top bods at
the school, including Jimmy Cosgrove, Head of Painting, and Mike Healy,
Head of Design, are crossing the Atlantic next week on a fund-raising
promotion to establish Friends of Glasgow School of Art in America. The
campaign, part of this year's 150th anniversary celebrations, will be
given a glamorous kick-start at a reception in the British Consulate in
New York next Tuesday.
Key organisers of this American soiree have been Eleanor and Don
Taffner whose company, DLT Entertainment Ltd, owns the rights to all the
Benny Hill shows and soaps such as Dallas. Using profits from popular
culture the Taffners are great patrons of art and long-term benefactors
to Glasgow School of Art.

SOMETHING tells me they don't know about copyrights in Never Land.
Else, instead of a mother to tell them stories, Peter and the Lost Boys
might have flown in a hot-shot lawyer to protect them against a new
breed of pirates.
Poor Peter -- and poor us. The damage Hook's iron claw might wreak on
J M Barrie's creation is nothing compared to the slashing and gutting
actually carried out by Peter Denyer in adapting the piece for this
touring production starring Toyah Willcox and Frank Finlay.
The idea seems to be -- keep the names, the characters, and bits of
business (especially the flying) that people know about, even if they
have never seen the original play. Then draft in gobbets of what passes
for family entertainment: a few songs, a spasm of acrobatic Redskins,
two panto-type mermaids, and you've got a potential earner.
Now, putting to one side the mental bile this inept pillaging of
Barrie's text produces in me, does the mixture as above add up to a good
night out? Lord help us -- anything but.
The music (by Barrie Bignold) is a series of synthesised swooshings in
search of a tune. The flying is tentative, and the mechanics of it
disappointingly obvious even to the tot behind me. The rotating set is
functional rather than excitingly full of detail. There is haste, but no
pace, and -- worst of all -- there is no magic, no thrilling plunge into
child's play, real or imagined.
But there is Toyah Willcox as Peter: striding about, a scruffy urchin
-- bit of a show-off, but likeable with it -- doing her determined,
energetic best to keep something of Pan's spirit alive and crowing.
If this is what happens to old plays when copyrights expire then
please, can I have a ticket to Never Land -- I don't want to grow any
older amidst the wreck of pirated plays I have loved.

SETTING yourself up to exhibit with Peter Howson, famous, lauded, and
official UK war artist to Bosnia to boot, is a brave thing to do --
unless you have survived much worse things together.
Iain McColl is indeed Howson's friend -- to the extent of accompanying
him on his return trip to the hellhole of Vitez and Travnik armed merely
with a video camera. Howson's generosity is well known, so what better
way to repay a favour than to propose a mutual touring exhibition which
will travel in Britain and abroad?
Message from Bosnia is the result and it opens at Kilmarnock's Dick
Institute tomorrow. Happily this is no second-class display for the
provinces, for it contains more than 80 works including all the big
blockbuster Howson oil paintings.
In addition Howson has loaned a wonderful series of sketchbook
drawings done on the spot plus several portrait heads of children and
old men and a couple of new, loose oils.
McColl is primarily known as a sculptor, producing zany, witty,
colourful neon and plastic works. Bosnia has changed all this, indeed he
says he hopes eventually to cast some Bosnian works in bronze, to
frieze, to encapsulate the horror. ''Forget all the academic
arguments,'' he says. ''This war is about people. When it is over, how
will they be able to live with themselves?''
Meanwhile he shows monumental black-and-white charcoal drawings,
simple but gripping evocations of bare flesh, muscular but vulnerable.
Surprisingly, of the two artists, his are the more intimate pictures. He
makes you remember that at its heart this battle and any battle is most
often between neighbour or brother. ''There's a mediaeval savagery about
it -- members of their own families kill each other. They torture each
other in unspeakable ways. They turn each other into meat.''
McColl's imagery is not sadistic or terrifying, nor does it attempt to
record these atrocities, but his exaggerated shadows and contorted forms
scream with anguish. Gagged and bound, Petrol Thief and Father and Son,
are impressive debuts. Later works become abstracted so that the figures
appear as organic, crouched, nightmare creatures with deformed limbs.
His heads, like Chetnik in Turbe or Cleansed, are less interesting;
indeed I would omit them from the tour. Howson's superb personal
portrait draftsmanship is impossible to beat, and McColl should stick
with his sculptural monuments.

FIRST performed at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1993, Lisa Kotin's
one-woman show has since been extended, with a second-half grafted on
which advances the story of the geeky temp-cum-aspiring-actress Jeanette
and her travails at Penniman's Publishing. Not a wise move.
While the previous version was a sharp-focus snapshot of a day in
office life, this production strains the joke somewhat in its attempt to
tie up the ends of the lives of the various characters depicted by
Kotin.
The first half boasts a snappy script and sly observations on various
office stereotypes; the fed-up temp, the ruthless power boss, the
technophobic old secretary, the diet-obsessed PA, the relentlessly
chirpy office manager.
You marvel at Kotin's physical transformations for each character and
are entertained while she makes them by quirky film clips. She has a
nice line in satire, with lines which make the audience groan in
empathy, as they did in unison when the office boss, Jill Hardwood,
witheringly snarled ''There's no I in team.''
However, the second-half falters; the scenario of an office Christmas
party is simply too easy meat and Kotin never really gets her knife in,
although you couldn't fail to smile at the description of an office
party as ''really bad dancers with really big hair dancing to really bad
bands with hardly any hair''.
Misgivings aside, it's worth checking out; although the plot and
structure are shakey, Kotin's performance is solid and the show, which
runs till Sunday, is a guaranteed fun night out for the girls -- and had
the guys giggling too.

A BOWLER hat, a boiler suit, and a bale of hay -- Guy Masterson's only
props in an ambitious two-and-a-half hour one-man version of George
Orwell's set text standard.
As anyone who saw Ken Campbell's Mystery Bruises last week will know,
the Traverse is making a habit of putting on long monologues at the
moment. Unlike Campbell, however, Masterson relies on character-acting
not force of personality to carry the show.
This is as much Animal Magic as Animal Farm. Masterson, like a
politicised Johnny Morris, taking on the voices of the pigs, horses,
sheep, and chickens in Orwell's allegory of Soviet communism.
The actor knows that this long -- probably too long -- show will
tighten up as he performs it, and as it does, perhaps he'll be able to
develop a greater distinction between the physical shape of the animals,
which he already portrays with an impressively brisk economy of
movements, and an even more sinister aspect to the rhetoric of the
upwardly mobile pigs who could be still more manipulative and two-faced.
The novel's narrative path is a relentless downward slope from
revolutionary optimism to the return of exploitation, and Masterson
needs to work hard to make up for the kind of tonal variation he
achieved in the Under Milkwood he performed last year.
For all the reservations, it's still an awesome achievement and one
that shows that Orwell's insights can apply just as much to contemporary
abuses of power after the old communists. How different from the pigs,
hogging their apples and milk, for example, are today's politicians
trying to convince us that executives need high salaries for our benefit
as much as their own?

Sex is winding its way to Tannochbrae. Allan Laing reports
IT is make-or-break time for Scottish Television's Doctor Finlay.
Audience figures for the last series peaked at 10 million but averaged
out at about eight million, enough to ensure its continued place in the
network for the time being. However, in order to carve its long-term
future in stone, it has to increase its share of viewers.
The drama returns for a third run tomorrow and this time round it is
competing against Dangerfield, a strong new medical series from BBC1.
Conscious of the need to attract a greater viewership, Scottish has made
some radical changes to the series. The setting might be a wee Scots
town in 1949 but the issues, according to new producer Bernard
Krichefski, will be right up to date. Whisper it to Janet, but sex,
child abuse, and gay relationships are winding their way to Tannochbrae
even as we speak.
''The fact that something is period drama doesn't mean that it has to
be simply an exercise in nostalgia. You can take something which is set
in another era and make it relevant to what is happening today,''
explained Englishman Krichefski, who was drafted in to beef up the
programme.
He warns that viewers will find this third series, well, surprising.
Which is different from shocking. Perhaps a little less comfortable and
predictable than in the past with subject matter which they might not
normally expect in a series which is perceived to be cosy and couthy.
All of a sudden, the 9pm watershed might just be relevant to Dr Finlay
and Dr Cameron.
''We have also tried to bring more variety into the style of each
episode. They are all different from each other. Some will be small,
moving, intimate stories while others will be very melodramatic, very
filmic stories,'' he explained.
Krichefski recognises the fact that television is producing more and
more series and fewer and fewer one-off films. Traditionally, within the
industry, professionals believe it is the single films or plays which
allow the original views of the writer and director to come through.
''With a series you are normally expected to make your episode look
like everyone else's. And that's the one thing we're trying very hard
not to do with Dr Finlay. It will look like watching individual films
each time,'' he added.
Scottish has also engaged some of Scotland's top writers to provide
the scripts. They include award-winning playwright Simon Donald (Brond,
Dun Roamin' Rising), Anne Marie di Mambro (The Advocates, Winners and
Losers), and veteran writer Bill Craig (Callan, and the original Vital
Spark).
The subject matter covered in the new series is enough to make old Dr
Snoddy turn in his grave. There's a story about domestic violence within
a gay relationship. There's another tale in which Finlay suspects the
local minister of interfering with a young member of the congregation,
an episode which touches on the child abuse debate. And there is a story
which involves a young doctor, a newcomer, becoming romantically
involved with the wife of one of his patients.
In addition, the new series carries through it a slightly feminist
theme. In one episode, for instance, a woman is suffering from a quite
appalling vaginal condition, which makes her incontinent. It has had an
adverse effect on her life and marriage for 30 years -- simply because
she has never been able to talk to a male doctor about it.
Krichefski added: ''I don't think we've done anything to change the
elements of the series which were successful in the past -- the basic
idea and the main cast are all still there. But you have to go on and
expand your audience. The most successful of TV series are those which
go on changing and developing without alienating the audience they
already have.
''With Dr Finlay you certainly cannot say that it has such a big
audience that it couldn't get bigger. The last series peaked at 10
million viewers and I would not suggest that any of the people who
enjoyed it in the past will not enjoy it in the future.''
He was anxious not to criticise what had gone before. Without the
previous two series, he said, they would not have been able to produce
what they have this time. But in the past some of the episodes had
perhaps been a little too downbeat. This time they had tried to inject
more humour, setting it against the power of some of the more moving
episodes.

A WOMAN suffering from a heart attack was sent home from a hospital
emergency department and told to take pain killers for muscular pain, a
fatal accident inquiry in Dundee heard yesterday.
But Mrs Irene Grunwell, 45, collapsed and died two hours after she was
discharged.
Yesterday a consultant cardiologist, Dr Kevin Jennings, concluded:
''The evidence suggests she had a heart attack a few hours before she
died.''
Her husband, Anthony, 53, told how, as they left the hospital on
February 8 last year, she turned to him and said: ''I'm frightened Tony.
I'm very, very frightened. I love you and I always will love you.''
When they reached home Mrs Grunwell ''screamed out'' and turned blue
and purple around the mouth.
Mr Grunwell, of Ballindean Road, Dundee, called the emergency services
and was told by paramedics that his wife's heart had stopped. Despite
frantic efforts to save her, Mrs Grunwell died.
He added that, in his opinion, his wife should have been kept in
overnight in hospital where at least she would have been ''in good
hands''.
Mrs Grunwell had been taken to Dundee Royal Infirmary by ambulance
after suffering two days of intense pain which a visiting doctor had
diagnosed as possible tennis elbow. He gave her pain killers and advised
her to see her own doctor.
Dr Jane Taylor, who saw Mrs Grunwell the next morning, said that Mrs
Grunwell complained of a sore elbow. The doctor added that she could not
see any other cause of pain from the symptoms Mrs Grunwell reported.
Dr Jennings told Dundee Sheriff Court that with the benefit of
hindsight, Mrs Grunwell had been presenting warning cardiac pain to
doctors.
But he added that her symptoms were not typical and there were very
few clues to suggest it was cardiac pain. The first clue was her fatal
collapse.
Mrs Grunwell's cause of death was coronary heart disease, said Dr
Diana Cox, who carried out a post-mortem examination.
There was some hardening and narrowing of blood vessels supplying the
heart.
Dr Hassan Dashti, who examined Mrs Grunwell at the hospital, said he
was sure she was suffering from muscular skeletal pain.
Sheriff Alastair Stewart will issue his findings at a later date.

A VETERINARY surgeon killed herself with a lethal injection of a drug
used to humanely destroy cats and dogs.
Glasgow University graduate Jenny James, 43, was found dead in her
second surgery in Winslow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday night by her
husband. Several suicide notes were lying nearby, along with a used
hypodermic syringe.
Mrs James is understood to have injected a lethal dose of sodium
pentobarbitone and would have died within a few seconds. She had been
dead for about one hour when her husband found her body.
Before moving south to Buckinghamshire, Mrs James had lived with her
parents -- consultant pathologist Mr George Roberts, of Glasgow's
Victoria Infirmary and his wife Jean -- in Newton Mearns, Glasgow.
Last night 73-year-old Mrs Roberts said: ''Animals had been Jenny's
life since she was 12.
''She set up her own surgery in Padbury in 1975 when she married Chris
and then about a year ago, things were going so well, she opened a
second surgery in Winslow.
''That was when things started to go wrong. Jenny came under a lot of
stress.
''About three weeks ago she injured her arm delivering a calf and was
quite worried about everything getting on top of her.
''She is the last person in the world I would expect to do something
like this although we had recently warned her several times to slow down
and take things a bit more easily.''
Last night her husband, Chris, was being comforted at his farm by his
daughters, Anna, 18, and Helen, 16.
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: ''Several notes were found
at the surgery and these will be given to the coroner. We are following
a number of lines of inquiry.
''It is too early to decide what caused her to take her life but we
are satisfied that the death was not suspicious.''

THE Department of Transport is criticised today for ending up with a
legal advice bill seven times more than it estimated for the sale of an
information technology agency.
The department did not rigorously assess the cost of the advice or
adequately control its cost, said a report by the National Audit Office.
This led to the department, which thought that legal costs would be
between #30,000 and #80,000, paying #545,000 excluding VAT.
The firm chosen to give the advice, Theodore Goddard, was not asked to
submit an estimate of costs when appointed.
When costs reached #144,000, the department tried to reach an
agreement to put a cap on costs. But Theodore Goddard resisted this,
arguing that the deal was complicated.
The sale in 1993 of DVOIT -- the driver vehicle operation information
technology agency section of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency --
to the electronic data systems company, EDS, produced gross proceeds of
#5.5m.
The audit office said the department successfully completed the sale
within a tight timetable and took ''reasonable steps to maximise net
receipts''.

THE chief executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise yesterday
defended his support for the proposed superquarry at Lingerbay in South
Harris, insisting it was not connected to the #125,000 HIE will receive
if the quarry goes ahead.
Mr Iain Robertson was appearing for the first time at the Lingerbay
public inquiry, which has been meeting in Stornoway since October. He
explained that in 1982, HIE's predecessor body, the Highlands and
Islands Development Board, had approved a grant and loan package to
Harris Minerals Ltd which had been set up by Mr Ian Wilson, who still
holds the mineral rights to Lingerbay.
In 1985 the company had gone into liquidation, and the HIDB had
obtained security over the mineral lease for the #125,000 loan. That
security was now vested in HIE.
''We have negotiated repayment of our loan by Redland Aggregates (lead
developers of the Lingerbay super quarry) if their planning application
succeeds, and we would be prepared to negotiate in similar terms with
any other developer,'' Mr Robertson said.
He was asked by Mr Colin Campbell QC, counsel for Scottish Natural
Heritage, what the value of the #125,000 loan would be today. Mr
Robertson said he wasn't sure. He didn't know whether interest had been
frozen or not.
Mr Campbell then went on to suggest that in the light of the loan it
would have been difficult for HIE to withdraw its support for the
project, and that having this interest ''it would prevent you from being
totally objective''.
Mr Robertson rejected this. HIE was required by the Treasury to take
all appropriate legal action to pursue debt but that had in no way
influenced HIE's support for Lingerbay. ''What we are interested in is
getting jobs for the people of Harris.''
Mr Robertson said later that although HIE monies were not normally
earmarked in this way, he would be happy to see the #125,000 coming back
to the Western Isles.
Asked about reports that Dr David Horrobin had said he would not take
his Scotia Pharmaceuticals development and the prospect of 50 jobs to
Harris if the quarry went ahead, Mr Robertson said HIE would be happy to
work with him to show this was wrong.
''I passionately believe that Harris will never get another
opportunity to get this number of jobs again, despite Dr Horrobin's
proposal for micro-algae development, despite the potential of
information technology and despite all the work we have done,'' Mr
Robertson said.
Asked by independent objector Mrs Alison Johnson if he was not alarmed
by historical parallels when considering his support for Lingerbay, Mr
Robertson replied: ''Yes I am alarmed by the parallels of islands which
have been depopulated, coastlines without anyone living there,
communities and their culture dying.''
Mrs Johnson said she had been thinking about the Highland Clearances
which also had been fuelled by a drive for progress. Mr Robertson said
he was not going to waste the inquiry's time by responding to that.
The inquiry continues.

Grozny, Wednesday
HEAVY fighting engulfed Grozny today as Chechen fighters resisted
Russian attempts to move out from the conquered centre to the suburbs.
The battle began in earnest late in the morning. Heavy artillery
shells and mortar bombs rained down on an outlying district from the
Russian-held centre, which was shrouded in thick white fog. The air was
filled with whistling and thunderous explosions.
''(Russian Defence Minister Pavel) Grachev said yesterday the city was
completely taken and only isolated pockets of resistance remained,'' one
fighter said with a grim laugh. ''Typical. We'll show him how things
really are.''
Later today, Itar-Tass news agency reported that two Russian
helicopters came under fire and crashed as they flew towards Grozny. The
two three-man crews of the Mi-24 attack helicopters were killed.
Grachev has faced criticism over the Chechnya campaign -- from
liberals because of the brutality used, and from inside the military for
the ineffectiveness of the campaign to break Chechen resistance quickly.
In Moscow, the State Duma, parliament's lower chamber, had been set to
discuss Grachev's fate today, but the debate was put back, and could end
up falling by the wayside.
Instead, Russia's powerful 14-man Security Council, meeting under
President Boris Yeltsin, praised Grachev.
It also said it would shift control of the campaign from the regular
army to the interior ministry, reflecting what it sees as the successful
completion of the military phase of the campaign to bring rebel Chechnya
to heel.
Rather than lambasting Grachev as expected, the Duma heard a string of
attacks from ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats
on Yeltsin's human rights commissioner Sergei Kovalyov, an outspoken
critic of the methods used in Chechnya.
Chechen fighters answered the Russian bombardment with non-stop
gunfire from western Zavodskoi district, where yesterday they blew up
half the bridge to Chernorechiye to stop Russian tanks from seizing a
dam.
The European Union said in Brussels it had granted more than $6m to
help the Red Cross with critical emergency work in Chechnya.

Patrick Brogan reports from Washington how Bill Clinton's long-winded
and often confusing State of the Union speech might yet restore his
fortunes.
BILL CLINTON was out of luck, again. He delivered his State of the
Union address the same day that the O J Simpson trial finally got under
way, and there was never any competition.
People are much more interested in the gruesome details from Los
Angeles than anything the President had to say.
All the same, it was a good speech and will at least contribute to the
restoration of the President's authority that his supporters so ardently
hope for. He has not been much seen or heard since the Democrats lost
control of Congress in November. Tuesday's speech was his chance to
return to the arena.
His problem is not just timing, it is image. He has been President for
two years and people are still uncertain who he is and what he believes.
The Republicans denounce him as an old-fashioned tax-and-spend
liberal, like Lyndon Johnson. Nobody believes them. He isn't. On the
other hand, real Democratic liberals think Mr Clinton has betrayed the
faith and is really a Republican in Democratic clothing.
That's not true, either. Nor is he a consistent, middle-of-the-road
moderate. In the State of the Union, as in his election campaign three
years ago and ever since, he swerved across the road and back again,
sometimes sounding like Newt Gingrich, sometimes like Teddy Kennedy.
It's a puzzlement.
He proclaimed in ringing tones that the American people want smaller
government and promised that he would continue the effort to shrink the
federal bureaucracy -- Republicans cheered loudly.
He proposed raising the minimum wage from its present level of $4.25,
and the Democrats cheered.
Republicans cheered when he promised to cut taxes, Democrats when he
promised to veto any attempt to repeal laws controlling gun ownership.
He defended the role of government in making the country work, but
without much conviction, and he said that welfare must be reformed --
promising to co-operate with Republicans who propose to eliminate it
altogether.
He sounded like the most reactionary of Republicans, promising to stop
illegal immigration, and then called on a Haitian immigrant, sitting in
the gallery to take a bow: the young man had joined the US Army and was
sent to Haiti in the invasion, to act as interpreter.
The President boasted that the United States was a country that could
find immigrant Haitians to perform such services, a few minutes after he
promised to stop any further Haitians reaching our shores.
It was all very confusing -- and he went on far too long, for about 85
minutes. When he is good, he is very, very good. When he is bad, he
drones on and on, until his listeners squirm with embarrassment.
His verbosity may not have mattered too much. The sound bites were
good, and will be replayed often enough. He has a programme that appeals
to Americans, in its very contradictions, and if he sticks to it, and
can make himself heard over the cacophony of competing voices, not to
mention O J Simpson, it should restore his political fortunes.
His theme goes like this: the economy is recovering, with rising
employment, low inflation and steady growth. The deficit is falling
steadily, for the first time in 40 years. However, middle-class
Americans are not noticeably better off than they were 20 years ago:
most of the extra profits have stayed with the rich, and on top of that
closing in of horizons, there is no longer job security for anyone.
Republicans want to reinforce the present income inequalities by
cutting taxes on the rich still further. Mr Clinton needs to persuade
everyone else that Democrats are concerned with middle-class Americans.
He is making some progress on that front, partly because the Republicans
are obsessive about tax breaks for the rich.
The fact that Mr Clinton does not appear to have any better idea than
anyone else how to get middle incomes rising again will catch up with
him eventually, but the need now is to persuade ordinary Americans that
he cares about their problems, unlike the Republicans.
Americans are tired of the government bureaucracy that gets in the way
of everything. Mr Clinton is behind the curve on this.
Although he can justifiably claim success in his ''reinventing
government'' programme, which had cut half a million bureaucrats from
government, the public associates unhelpful civil servants and
impossible regulations with his party.
He is working on that. He has also, finally, admitted that it was a
mistake to try to reform the health care system in one fell swoop. He
will be more modest this year and will accept a series of important,
incremental reforms. The Republicans will try to take the credit, but
this is a good cause for the Democrats and they should benefit from any
new legislation that gets through.
The President long ago promised to ''end welfare as we know it''. He
got nowhere in his first two years, and is still battling with the
public perception that the Democrats are in the business of transferring
money from deserving folks into the pockets of spendthrift layabouts
(meaning black, teenage, unmarried mothers).
It is very important for Mr Clinton to change that perception, to
persuade Americans that the Democratic party really wants to reform
welfare. The fact that teenage mothers take up less than 1% of the
budget is neither here nor there. The country believes that the streets
are no longer safe and taxes are far too high because of these people,
and Mr Clinton must find a way of dealing with them.
He has a couple of slogans: he has proposed a ''Middle Class Bill of
Rights'', and a ''New Covenant'' between Americans. You don't need to
know what they mean, if they mean anything. The immediate question,
which is also the question of who will win the next election, is whether
Mr Clinton can persuade people that these two slogans are better for
them than the Republican ''Contract with America''.
He has to convey the impression that he is a man of conviction and
that his certainty of purpose is better for America than the
Republicans'. He hasn't managed it for two years.
But don't count him out. The novelty of the Republican Congress will
wear off soon enough, and people will then start blaming the Republicans
for everything that goes wrong. Mr Clinton hopes to benefit from the
very short attention span of the American electorate -- which is much
more interested in O J , anyway.

A POSSESSIVE lover was jailed for life at the Old Bailey yesterday for
strangling his partner, a student.
Lawrence Hughes, 20, had a stormy relationship with Aileen
Gibson-Steele, who was from one of Ireland's leading sporting families
and the sister-in-law of the Irish rugby internationalist, Peter
Clohessy.
Hughes, of Finsbury Park, north London, had admitted the manslaughter
of his lover in June last year on the grounds of provocation, but denied
murder. The jury deliberated for four hours before convicting him.
The Recorder of London, Sir Lawrence Verney, told him: ''The
circumstances of this case are very tragic indeed, and the consequences
of your actions are terrible.''
Miss Gibson-Steele, 25, a university psychology student, met Hughes at
Christmas 1993 and they began going out. By March he was spending a lot
of time at her home in Haringey, north London, and stayed nights.
According to others who shared the house, it was a stormy
relationship.
Mr David Calvert-Smith, prosecuting, said: ''He was a possessive
boyfriend. He used to follow Aileen around and touch her constantly, and
sometimes this upset her.
''They often argued, and on many occasions she tried to break off the
relationship.''
As a result, he cut his wrists several times and was treated in
hospital.
By the time of her death the relationship was not quite over, and
Hughes, who was unemployed, clearly wanted it to continue.
The night she was strangled, fellow residents heard the sound of a row
and crying coming from her room, but this was not unusual. At various
times during the next day they knocked with telephone messages, only to
hear Hughes shouting that Miss Gibson-Steele was out.
But, after hearing him leave the room, a suspicious fellow resident
went in and found the body.
There were signs that she had been hit in the face and a hand clamped
hard over her mouth. After the killing, Hughes locked himself in the
room with her body for 36 hours.
Police found him in an outside lavatory, lapsing in and out of
consciousness from self-inflicted neck injuries.
Regaining consciousness in hospital, he began to cry and asked ''Where
is my baby?''.
In her room, police found torn-up notes he had written between the
killing and his arrest.
''She tried to help me and I killed her, I love my baby,'' read one.
In another to fellow residents of the house, he wrote: ''I am so sorry
for taking her away from you. Please please God forgive me for taking
someone so beautiful away from everyone who loves her.''
Michael Kalisher, QC, defending, told the court that Hughes was filled
with remorse.
''His love for her was genuine. He will never recover from what he
did,'' he said.

REDLAND Aggregates Ltd, whose planning application for a #70m coastal
superquarry in Harris is the subject of a public inquiry, is offering to
sponsor two or three students from the Western Isles on university
degree courses.
This would be part of the company's national initiative to assit
students with both their academic studies and vocational experiences.
The offer is not dependent on the company receiving approval for the
Lingerbay quarry.
In a statement issued yesterday Redland said details of the offer are
being circulated to all sixth-year students in the islands through the
careers office of the Western Isles Council in Stornoway. The
sponsorship offer covers financial support through the three-year degree
course, with a strong element of vocational work experience during
university holidays at Redland's existing operational sites.

Will hypnosis unravel the memory of Myra Hindley? Anne Johnstone
examines the case for and against.
THE haunted face of Winnie Johnson, treading Saddleworth Moor each
weekend in search of her murdered son Keith, must surely be one of the
most disturbing images of post-war Britain. Few today will argue with
the decision by Prisons Minister Michael Forsyth to overturn previous
Home Office rulings and allow Moors murderer Myra Hindley to be
hypnotised in a bid to find the body of Keith Bennett.
But what are the chances that after 31 years hypnosis can dislodge a
memory that conventional interviewing techniques have failed to unearth?
And if successful, what would be the implications for future criminal
investigations and missing-person searches? Hypnosis is already in the
hot seat over the claims and counterclaims about its usefulness in
excavating buried memories of child sex abuse.
The hypnotists argue ''recovered memories'' of previously forgotten
traumas recovered by hypnotic techniques are largely accurate. Their
detractors say hypnotists are implanting ''false memories'' of events
which never happened. A recent commissioned report by the British
Psychological Society on the subject came down heavily on the fence.
The argument is apparently irrelevant to the Hindley case. After all,
false memories of child sex abuse can wreck the lives of those accused
of perpetrating it. False memories of where Hindley and her accomplice
Ian Brady hid the body of 12-year-old Keith would simply give a few
policemen with spades a spot of fruitless elbow work.
Home Office guidelines on the use of hypnosis in criminal
investigations, for either the accused or witnesses, strongly discourage
the practice. ''There is no evidence that a brain automatically stores
complete and accurate data which hypnosis may have some ability to
unlock,'' states the 1988 guidelines. They go on to warn that any
evidence obtained under hypnosis is likely to be inadmissible. But this
is no longer a police investigation, as such. Hindley and Brady have
admitted the murder.
The consensus among psychologists yesterday was that hypnotising
Hindley is a very long shot indeed. There was some disagreement about
whether it is a long shot worth taking.
Dr Graham Wagstaff of Liverpool University has done extensive research
about how people remember things and whether they remember them better
under hypnosis. His conclusion is that they don't. Asked to remember
details from a video or lists of objects, those who had been hypnotised
believed they could remember more, but a lot of their memories were
false.
''Things happen that we don't encode. If we don't encode them we can't
retrieve them,'' said Wagstaff. But even things we do store away, we
often can't retrieve. That's why we need ''retrieval cues'', he added.
This involves associating what we can't remember, such as an accident,
with what we can, such as where it took place, what the weather was like
on the day, and other peripheral detail.
Hypnosis, said Wagstaff, involves first hypnotic induction (in which
the subject is made to relax and concentrate), followed by a series of
instructions or suggestions intended to unlock the memory. Wagstaff
believed these ''memory mnemonics'' can work without the induction.
''The problem with putting these techniques in the context of hypnosis
is that under hypnosis some people confabulate. Their imaginations run
riot and they start to imagine all sorts of things.''
Professor Graham Davies of Leicester University, another researcher in
the field, said: ''The consistent finding of researchers is that memory
under hypnosis is no more reliable than normal memory.''
Dr Michael Heap of Sheffield University uses hypnosis on victims of
post-traumatic stress. He believes that under certain specific
circumstances hypnosis can enable somebody to retrieve a key memory.
''If there has been a trauma and the memory is there, but the person is
unable or unwilling to go through it, I believe hypnosis can be very
helpful. Where someone has committed a crime and years later they are
still unable to remember part of what happened because distress or
guilt, hypnotic procedures can help.''
Does Hindley fall into this category? The fact that she was prepared
to return to Saddleworth Moor in 1987 to try to identify the burial site
suggests not. That is why Home Office appointed psychologists will
examine Hindley before she is deemed a suitable subject for hypnosis.
Dr Michael Oakley of University College London uses hypnosis for work
with survivors of abuse. He said: ''Hypnosis on Hindley is worth a try
but it's quite possible that she's simply forgotten. There are so many
sites on the moor that look the same that there may not be any
distinguishing features to remember. A hypnotic regression might trigger
memories that are helpful but such techniques offer no magic memory
retrieval process.''
Despite official Home Office disapproval of the use of hypnosis in
criminal investigations, it has been used on a number of celebrated
occasions. The vogue for it came from the US where Martin Reiser, head
of the behavioural science unit of Los Angeles Police, used to train
detectives in the use of hypnosis on suspects and witnesses.
The officers were known as ''Svengali Squads''. ''They had some
striking successes but also some spectacular failures,'' said Prof
Davies. The most celebrated case was the so-called ''Chowchilla
kidnapping'' when a school bus was abducted and the children
incarcerated in a trailer in a quarry.
Under hypnosis the driver recalled the licence plate number of the car
used by the abductor, who was subsequently detained. The key point is
that the driver had attempted to memorise the number at the time. In
other words, he had encoded the information.
Hypnosis has also been used in Britain in a number of celebrated cases
but always unsuccessfully. Professor Gwyn Jones hypnotised one of the
Yorkshire Ripper's victims who survived but this didn't lead to his
apprehension.
Lothian and Borders Police used hypnosis to try to help a motorist
recall the number plate and other details of a car seen speeding south
with a little girl on the back seat two hours after the abduction of
Caroline Hogg, who was subsequently found murdered. A team of experts
from Ford in Dagenham came to Edinburgh to try to identify the vehicle
he described but it turned out to be a false trail.
Strathclyde Police occasionally call in a hypnotist, usually in
intractable murder cases, such as that of Diane McInally, the murdered
Glasgow prostitute. Witnesses were asked to remember details of vehicles
in the area at the time of the murder but were unable to supply any
cogent information.
In the most celebrated case of all, the use of hypnosis was the basis
of a successful appeal. In January 1992 it was discovered that West
Mercia Police had failed to disclose a video of a hypnosis session
undergone by a witness in the trial of Eddie Browning for the murder of
Marie Wilkes on the M50.
Under hypnosis, the witness, an off-duty police officer, recalled the
number plate and various details about a car he had seen stopped at the
scene but these did not fit Browning's vehicle. The police failed to
disclose the video to the court, relying instead on other information
provided by the witness before he was hypnotised. Browning was sentenced
to life with a recommendation that he serve at least 25 years for the
horrific murder of the 22-year-old woman who was seven months pregnant
at the time.
But largely on the basis that police had suppressed the video
evidence, the Court of Appeal freed Browning last year.
The case for and against hypnosis is far from over. If Hindley
discloses the location of Keith Bennett's body under its influence, it
will be hailed as a triumph for hypnosis. Dr Wagstaff will take more
convincing than that: ''One side of hypnosis is that it can be used as
an excuse to say something. It may be something they have not previously
wanted to say but now want an excuse to say. It's easier to say: 'I've
been hypnotised and now I can remember' than saying 'Suddenly I've
remembered',''he said.
Alas, the more likely outcome is that the memory of her unspeakable
crime is no longer there to be retrieved or that it has been confused by
subsequent events. The awful danger is that it will raise Winnie
Johnson's hopes of putting her son to rest, only to confound them again,
leaving this poor lady to continue wandering Saddleworth Moor in search
of her lost boy forever.

Sarajevo, Wednesday
MEDIATORS from the five-nation ''contact group'' broke off their
mission to Bosnia today, accusing the Bosnian Serbs of blocking the way
to a resumption of peace talks.
The contact group, comprised of officials from the United States,
Russia, Britain, Germany and France, failed to persuade the Bosnian
Serbs to give explicit backing to a peace plan designed to end nearly
three years of war.
A four-month ceasefire in force since January 1 had been intended to
lead to new peace negotiations.
One member of the group, US envoy Charles Thomas, stayed behind and
met Bosnian government leaders behind closed doors, the US embassy in
Sarajevo said. It did not elaborate.
Russian envoy Alexei Zotov said that fresh peace talks were not in
sight because the Serbs would not accept a map dividing Bosnia almost
equally between the Serbs and a Muslim-Croat federation.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Wednesday
FORMER footballer O.J. Simpson's lawyers told a hushed court today
that prosecutors in ''a rush to judgment and obsession to win at any
cost'' mishandled evidence and ignored vital witnesses to charge Simpson
with murdering his former wife and a friend.
A day after prosecutors said a trail of blood from the murder scene to
a dirty sock in Simpson's bedroom proved him to be the killer, the
defence countered with tales of a botched investigation and a mystery
witness who said she saw four men run from Nicole Brown Simpson's house
at the time police say the murders must have been committed.
''Who's to say those four men running from the area of 875 Bundy
(Drive) hadn't followed Ronald Goldman there as opposed to looking for
Nicole Brown Simpson,'' lead Simpson defence attorney Johnnie Cochran
said, referring to the victims and giving the defence's first hint of an
alternative reason for the murders.
Cochran painted Simpson as the warm, likable man the public has known
as a celebrity athlete, advertising pitchman and film actor -- a man who
took care of his family, gave to Aids charities and Israel and was not
even jealous when his ex-wife had an affair with one of his closest
friends.
''The evidence will show that O.J. Simpson is an innocent man who has
been wrongfully accused,'' said Cochran as he mocked the defence's claim
that the wail of Nicole Brown Simpson's dog at 10.15pm on June 12, 1994,
signalled that murder had been committed.
''They have to tell you about a dog's wail while a man's life is at
stake . . . the prosecution in its opening statement never mentioned the
coroner because the coroner was not able to establish the time of death
as he was not called until eight hours after the murders,'' Cochran
said.
He also mocked the prosecution's claim that Simpson had enough time to
eat a Big Mac at a local McDonald's and then get into his car and drive
to his ex-wife's house and kill her.
''You got to believe he is planning to kill his wife even before he
got the Big Mac. You have to believe he went home and said 'Gee, I think
I'll kill my wife now, but first I'll take off these tennis shoes and
put on dress shoes.'''
His house guest Kato Kaelin has said in pre-trial testimony that
Simpson was wearing tennis shoes when the two went to McDonald's.
Prosecutors said the bloody footprints found at the scene of the crime
were left by expensive Italian-made shoes.
Cochran said that besides the witness who says she saw four men
running from the area of Nicole Brown Simpson's home, the defence would
also produce a witness who said he saw a man embrace Nicole at about
10pm while a Caucasian or Hispanic man looked on angrily.
He said he also had witnesses who heard noises near Nicole's home and
a woman who lived next door to Simpson and saw his white Bronco vehicle
parked at his home at the time of the killings.
The woman, Cochran said, also heard prowlers on Simpson's estate after
he left for a flight for Chicago.
The prosecution maintains that blood and hair samples of the victims
was found in the Bronco.
Cochran charged that police paid no attention to these witnesses and
in fact, one woman could not get through to a district attorney official
because the person was busy talking to a psychic.
In his long-awaited opening statement, Cochran quoted freely from
Martin Luther King Jr, Abraham Lincoln and Cicero and praised his client
as a true humanitarian.

PARTS of a German U-boat were flooded after it was in collision with a
Royal Navy frigate during a cat-and-mouse war game in the Channel
yesterday.
The U-14 submarine of the German navy was at periscope depth when the
accident occurred with the 4400-ton HMS Battleaxe off Portland Bill,
Dorset.
The Navy said no-one had been injured in the incident and that damage
was minor.
Two torpedo tubes and a ballast tank on the 500-ton diesel-electric
U-boat were smashed by Battleaxe's starboard propeller and flooded.
However, the submarine's pressure hull was not pierced and it was able
to surface and return to Portland naval base under its own steam.
Engineers from Portland and navy divers checked both vessels and the
British and German authorities were liaising about launching an
investigation into what caused the collision.
The Royal Navy regularly uses German and Dutch diesel-electric boats
for exercises as Britain is selling the last of its conventionally
powered submarines -- four Upholder class boats -- to Canada.
The German U-boat is only a fifth of the size of the Upholder boats
with a crew of 22.
Mike Critchley, editor of Warship World, said the German submarine had
a very lucky escape.
''Damage to her empty torpedo tubes indicates she basically ran into
the churning propellers of the frigate -- at periscope depth,'' said Mr
Critchley, a retired Royal Navy officer.

In 1994, there were 95 drug-related deaths in Strathclyde
region. This year, before the first month is out, the toll has
started rising. And behind every one of those victims is a
human story that should concern us all. Stephen McGinty
retraces the last days of one who struggled, and lost
ALICE arrived bent double with stomach cramps, sweating and shaking
violently. It was at the Querns family's bi-monthly gathering at their
elderly parents' house in Springfield Road, Maryhill, that the
34-year-old begged for help. The date was September 17, a Saturday
afternoon, 24 hours after she had last injected heroin and Temazepam
into the veins in her right arm.
Alice's sisters Margaret, Theresa, Pauline, and Laura were present,
and had known she was using but had tried to dissuade her. If not for
herself then for her five-year-old son Darren, afflicted with cystic
fibrosis. He knew his mum took drugs. He talked, without comprehension,
of how ''ma'' took ''Valium and eggs''. Alice, in tears and in pain,
assured them she wanted to quit, she had had enough, she could take it
no longer.
She had previously been a young woman with spiked, tinted hair and a
wide smile whose idea of a good time was a new outfit and a Saturday
night at The Mayfair, where she drank only Irn-Bru. At 19 her son
Stephen had died, aged three days. Her daughter Lisa, 11, now lived with
her father. Now unemployed, she was proudest of her term in London as a
housemaid at Claridge's Hotel.
What began with ecstasy or speed had grown over 18 months until she
was taking Temazepam tablets each day on top of a #30 bag of heroin. But
now she believed her life had begun to look up. She had recently become
involved with a decent man, Joseph Girvan, and had a new house in
Gillhill Street, Maryhill. Together they planned to decorate and begin
again.
Distraught, Margaret, Theresa, and their mother agreed to help her,
with the family's support. But this had to be the last time. ''We told
her we couldn't be made fools of again. It had happened too many times
before,'' said Margaret. It was agreed Alice should move home and
together, as a family, they would win. The immediate problem was Alice's
condition. ''A pale bag of bones'' was how Theresa described her.
In the centre of Glasgow's East End, opposite St Michael's Church,
sits the Gallowgate Drug Support Unit, staffed on a voluntary basis by
Willie Colclough and James Docherty, Margaret's brother-in-law and the
father of two drug-using sons. It was just after a fund-raising jumble
sale that Alice arrived, supported by her sisters. She was ''rattling'',
said James, and too ashamed to talk openly about what she was taking.
Alone, she opened up a little and explained her daily drug diet. James
knew from the long nights holding his own grown-up boys as they
convulsed, thrashed, screamed, vomited, and soiled the bed what Alice
was in for. He then told Margaret and Theresa to buy a dozen Temazepam
and administer them twice a day to take off the edge. The only source
was dealers. Theresa hailed a taxi and Alice lead the way.
They stopped at three drug houses in Westmuir Street, without success.
It was a couple of kids playing football in Carntyne who told them of an
''all-night chemist''. That night Theresa took the first shift, climbing
into her mother's big double bed and hugging her sister as she screamed
and wept and began convulsions like epileptic fits.
On Sunday night Margaret slept with Alice, who was suffering terrible
diarrhoea and vomiting, and on Monday night, 65-year-old Alice Querns
climbed in beside her daughter for a sleepless shift.
Alice, Margaret, and Theresa slowly walked on Monday to Maryhill Post
Office, where Margaret and Theresa confiscated her unemployment benefit
so that she would be unable to buy drugs. The three sisters then visited
the Gallowgate Drug Support Unit, but Alice shook so badly she could
hardly speak.
The next day they returned to attend Maxie Richard's Tuesday clinic.
The Evening Times Scotswoman Of The Year has counselled hundreds of
addicts. After talking with Alice she agreed to arrange for her to be
assessed for a place in Castle Craig, a rehabilitation centre in
Peeblesshire.
The problem was time. Alice Querns was not an emergency case. She
would have to wait. Only after a positive assessment from the staff at
Castle Craig could an addict apply for funding from the Greater Glasgow
Health Board. This was organised between her GP and Dr Laurence Gruer,
HIV and addiction co-ordinator at Ruchill Hospital.
In September the process could take two weeks. In some cases, much
longer.
Alice began waiting one day at a time. First at the Gallowgate centre,
where she was talked to and fed tea. Her shaking had subsided but she
remained panicky and required constant reassurance. She wasn't bad, the
volunteers explained, just sick, but getting better.
On the Thursday she attended the Glasgow Drug Problem Service at
Ruchill Hospital. She spent her seventh day of withdrawal in the
Gallowgate with other addicts struggling to stay clean. Her mind was
slowly clearing, which brought guilt and depression.
The tiny Temazepam ration had now run out and she decided to go on
with only a doctor's prescription as a chemical crutch. The following
week Alice began to take an interest in her appearance. On the Wednesday
she arrived at the Gallowgate in a new outfit and with her hair done.
She talked happily about attending the day programme at Ruchill and
taking more responsibility for Darren.
The next weekend she spent in the relative comfort of Bearsden at the
home of Maxie Richards. Released from the pressures of home and the
spectre of past wrongs she opened up and talked of her desire to be a
good mother, to make amends to her family, to travel abroad one day.
''It was obvious that she was under enormous pressure but she said she
could see a time when it would be possible to be free of drugs,'' said
Maxie.
Back in Maryhill she planned a holiday with her sisters to Marjorca
and wrote Maxie a thank-you note. Alice was now into October and more
than two weeks clean when she received an assessment at Castle Craig.
They agreed to admit her when funding was available.
Alice plugged herself into meetings of Narcotics Anonymous and regular
visits to the smoky little office in the Gallowgate. She returned to St
Michael's and arranged for Darren's baptism. But when the bad memories
returned she often said she couldn't wait any longer.
By now she had moved back into the house in Gillhill Street beside
Joseph Girvan, but remained in close contact with her family, who had
been told they had to let her go. On Monday, October 10, she dropped in
on Joe, kissed him, then explained that she was visiting her parents and
had some NA meetings to attend.
She returned to her parents, and sat and talked with Margaret before
saying she was just popping out. Instead of returning to Gillhill
Street, the Gallowgate, or the Monday night NA meeting at St Luke's in
Calton, she walked to Emerson Street and the home of an old boyfriend
who was still using.
She had bumped into him earlier that day and had decided to take drugs
once more. With her tolerance weakened, a normal fix of heroin made her
collapse. Her former boyfriend found her unconscious and called an
ambulance, but Alice Querns was dead on arrival at Stobhill Hospital.
The police contacted her parents, but it was Margaret and Theresa's
husbands, John Docherty and Robert Allen, who identified Alice. Two days
later, John Docherty went to offer Joe support. When he arrived at the
house he found him happily painting. John broke the news to him while
Joe still wore his overalls.
Alice's six-year-old son Darren now lives with his Aunt Theresa. He
didn't know why everyone was crying. Theresa said: ''He just said he
wished he was Superman, then he could fly to heaven and bring his mummy
home.'' On October 19 Alice Querns was buried at Dalbeth Cemetery.
On November 14 a new contract was signed between Greater Glasgow
Health Board and Castle Craig, granting addicts easier access to beds.
On the December 29 Maxie Richards organised an all-night vigil in
Glasgow's George Square in remembrance of the 95 drug deaths in
Strathclyde region in 1994. Alice Querns was number 71. Both Margaret
and Theresa stood through the freezing small hours until daybreak.
On January 12, 27-year-old Garry Currie was found unconscious in
Ellesmere Street, Possilpark.
The first victim of a New Year.
FACTFILE: A CLIMATE THAT BRINGS THE UNTHINKABLE INTO THE OPEN.
THE 95 drug deaths in Strathclyde region in 1994 and the increasing
abuse throughout the country have created an environment where the
unthinkable is now being openly discussed.
Earlier this month the MP for Carrick and Loudun, Willie McKelvey,
argued that heroin and other hard drugs should be prescribed to addicts
by the state. The chairman of the Scottish Affairs Committee said in an
interview: ''The only way to stop the slaughter of those who take hard
drugs or who are killed in criminals' wars over 'territory' is to take
the whole drugs industry under state control so that supply, control,
and prescribing of all drugs, even to those addicted, is carried out by
state management.''
It is a grim thought for grim times. In 1994 the Scottish Affairs
Committee published its report into drug abuse which revealed that
drug-related crime cost the taxpayer #1000m a year.
Glasgow has an estimated 10,000 injecting drug addicts, half the
figure for Scotland. One in 10 aged between 13 and 15 have tried either
drugs or solvents. One Glasgow GP reported that half the kids in a
Glasgow secondary school had injected drugs. Another GP reported how
Temazepam prescriptions had increased by 131%.
In Strathclyde in the last four weeks there have been four
drug-related deaths. The victims were Garry Currie, 27; William Stewart,
19; James McGuire, 38; and 25-year-old Sean Cochrane. ITV's World In
Action is currently researching a programme on Strathclyde's drug
problem.
There are many reasons for the high death-rate. Most recently,
evidence has been found to support the idea that there is a hepatitis
epidemic, with 80% of Glasgow drug injectors infected.
The director of the Scottish Drugs Forum, David Liddell, believes
there are two key factors behind the deaths. ''These are the current
high level of injecting and the polydrug use which is part of Glasgow
drug culture. People use a number of substances in the same hit and that
is essentially administered by injecting.
''Another reason is the wide spread of the problem. It's estimated
that there are 10,000 injectors in Glasgow. The number of deaths is part
of that scale.''
This is backed by Strathclyde Police, who also say they are continuing
to target drug dealers at every level. Detective Supt Kevin Orr of the
drug squad said: ''The reason for all the deaths is that there is so
much abuse of drugs.''
Temazepam is one of the most abused drugs. A sleeping pill, it is
available on prescription and can be taken either orally or injected,
once heated. Many doctors and drugs workers believe it should be banned.
In 1991 the Home Office recommended to the Department of Health that it
be controlled. However, the idea was rejected, as an alternative
sleeping pill would be more expensive.
Today drug addicts can get free access to a methadone programme and
clean needles. In 1994 the 24-hour Drug Crisis Centre opened in
Glasgow's West Street with 12 beds for emergency cases. But it is
aftercare for addicts trying to recover that remains limited.
We told her we couldn't be made fools of again. It had happened too
many times.

'rattling' and too

openly about what
she was taking

A FOOTBALL match, billed as a friendly, ended with a player
head-butting an opponent in the face.
Norman Lawson, 35, fouled a player, then butted him when he got up,
knocking him down again. The player suffered two chipped teeth, a cut
inside his mouth, and a bleeding nose.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday Lawson was fined #250 and ordered
to pay his victim #100 compensation by Sheriff John Young.
Lawson, of Alan Breck Gardens, Clermiston, Edinburgh, admitted
assaulting Mr Neil Hardie at Saughton Park, Edinburgh, on July 25, 1994,
by butting him on the face.
Depute-fiscal Carol Rowe told the court the incident happened near the
end of a supposedly friendly match between Lawson's Safeway shop staff
team and a one made up of Gyle Centre staff.
She added that it cost Mr Hardie #45 to have his teeth repaired.
Lawson's solicitor said he had received a written warning from his
employers as he had been representing Safeway at the time of the
incident.

<HEADLINE>Proposal unveiled before Nolan Committee Labour calls for 'ethics police'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980173079</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Labour Party yesterday unveiled a plan to appoint a team of ethics
police, charged with investigating allegations of sleaze in the House of
Commons and breaches of a proposed new Code of Conduct for MPs on their
outside interests.
The proposal was revealed at a hearing of the Nolan Committee
inquiring into standards in public life.
However, with her front-bench colleagues up in arms over the
revelation that former Cabinet Minister Lord Wakeham had just accepted a
#50,000-a-year seat on the board of City bank Rothchilds, Shadow Leader
of the House Ann Taylor insisted that the body, despite its proposed
investigative role, should exist only in an advisory capacity.
Having discussed her likely evidence to the committee with fellow MPs
-- not all in the Labour Party -- and having been briefed by Labour
leader Tony Blair, Mrs Taylor took pains to emphasise that the proposed
new body could not impinge on the sovereignty of the House of Commons.
In the final analysis, it would be up to MPs to decide what, if any,
action should be taken and up to them to decide on any penalty that
might follow a proven breach of new rules.
Mrs Taylor suggested a new ''Ethics Advisory Office'' be established
along the lines of the National Audit Office, which does retain public
confidence in the matters it investigates.
Just as the NAO reports to the Public Accounts Committee, so too would
the new ethics body report to the Privileges Committee. In turn that
committee would report back to MPs.
The independence of the new body would be guaranteed if its head was
appointed under Letters Patent, she suggested. That would mean he or she
could be fired only by the Monarch.
Central to her proposal, which does encompass current thinking within
the Labour leadership, was the establishment of a new comprehensive
system of registration of all MPs' interests. This, she said, would
ensure greater transparency and confidence in proceedings in the House
of Commons.
''The register should, in future, contain a description of the
interests of each MP, with contracts and agreements being deposited with
the registrar and open to public inspection. The amounts that Members
receive from outside interests should also be disclosed.''
Mrs Taylor, who last summer relinquished a relationship with a
political lobbying firm, Westminster Communciations, in the wake of the
''cash for questions'' row, said later that under her proposals she
would have to have declared how much she had been paid.
However, she was not at this stage prepared to disclose fees she had
received in this role. There should, she told the committee, be a new
and clear Code of Conduct for MPs on payments for parliamentary
activities and declarations of interest.
At present these were encompassed in various sections in Erskine and
May -- the House of Commons handbook. While all matters to be covered by
her proposed code could be found in that publication, there was no
straight list that MPs could easily refer to.
Mrs Taylor was not opposed to individual MPs carrying on interests in
businesses that they had been involved in before becoming MPs and to
which they might have to return. She suggested there might not even be a
conflict if MPs were linked to lobby organisations.

KOBE: A tremor measuring 3.6 on the Richter scale rocked this western
port city yesterday, eight days after it was devastated by a powerful
earthquake, the Japan Meteorological Agency announced.
Japanese television networks briefly broke into normal programmes to
report the tremor but there were no immediate reports of casualties or
damage.
Kobe residents said the latest tremor was not ''even a jolt'' compared
with the January 17 quake, measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale, which
killed more than 5000 people and injured 27,000 in the region.
It was the latest in a string of almost 1000 aftershocks since the
original earthquake.
However, in a sign of a new Japanese awareness of the potential for
damage from tremors in normally earthquake-free areas, railway
authorities immediately shut down a bullet train track between Kyoto and
Osaka, two cities which suffered minor damage on January 17.

<HEADLINE>Fears of job losses after Sainsbury takes over Texas</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ELIZABETH BUIE</BYLINE>

<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980173082</RECORDNO>

HEAVY job losses are expected to follow the #290m takeover of 241
Texas Homecare stores by Sainsbury yesterday.
However fewer than 1000 of Texas Homecare's 11,600 employees are based
in Scotland. Texas has only 24 Scottish stores. Most of them are
situated in central belt.
Over the next two years, Texas stores will be incorporated into
Sainsbury's own Homebase chain. With no Homebase stores in Scotland,
hopes were high last night that the majority of the Texas stores would
continue to operate under the Homebase banner.
Sainsbury refused to speculate on its future plans as the takeover is
subject to approval by the Office of Fair Trading.
Texas, which is owned by Ladbroke -- better known for its hotel and
betting activities -- had been losing ground in the DIY market and had
planned to close 40 of its stores around the country.
Following the takeover, Sainsbury will review that programme and one
or two stores may be saved, according to its chairman, Mr David
Sainsbury.
Sainsbury has, however, already identified 15 Texas stores it will
close because of their proximity to existing Homebase outlets. It will
also open 20 new DIY stores under the Homebase banner which will give it
a combined holding of 280 stores by March 1996 with a turnover
approaching #1000m.
A spokewoman for Sainsbury said yesterday that the company had not
ruled out the possibility of converting some of its newly acquired Texas
sites into supermarkets.
''That it is a possibility, but it has not yet been reviewed in
detail,'' she said.
Sainsbury currently has three supermarkets in Scotland -- at Darnley
in Glasgow, East Kilbride, and Craigleith in Edinburgh -- and a
Savacentre store at Cameron Toll, Edinburgh. Applications to build new
stores in Dundee, Ayr, Sheriffhall (south of Edinburgh), Kirkcaldy, and
Aberdeen are also planned, while work has started on-site at Braehead in
Glasgow for a joint project with Marks and Spencer.
Sainsbury had hoped that by launching a counter-bid to Tesco's
takeover of William Low it would be able to expand in Scotland. Its
failed bid, however, may well persuade it to use the Texas acquisition
as an alternative means of gaining territory in Scotland, particularly
as councils are proving reluctant to grant planning permission for large
out-of-town stores.
Texas, the second largest DIY chain after B&amp;Q, currently has stores in
Aberdeen (two), Ayr, Bearsden, Bishopbriggs, Coatbridge, Dumbarton,
Dumfries, Dundee (two), Dunfermline, East Kilbride, Edinburgh (three),
Elgin, Glasgow, Glenrothes, Greenock, Irvine, Livingston, Perth,
Uddingston, and Wishaw.
Professor Leigh Sparks, head of Stirling University's Institute of
Retail Studies, said: ''Moving into the DIY market in a bigger way is a
logical step for Sainsbury.
''The implications, particularly for Scotland, depend on how well each
of these stores is trading. Sainsbury is looking to expand its food
stores and is looking to push its Homebase chain into Scotland.''
Mr Barry Allen, a spokesman for the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said
despite job losses associated with the takeover, Usdaw had no
negotiating rights with Texas, but had a longstanding agreement with
Sainsbury.
''The Sainsbury takeover in some ways could be beneficial because it
has apparently said it will review the former closure programme,'' he
said.

A TOURIST board chairman has resigned in a row over a top job to steer
tourism in the Lothians into the future.
The dispute started after hotelier Raymond Binnie, 43, the chairman of
East Lothian Tourist Board for the past seven years, nominated himself
for the chairmanship of the Edinburgh and Lothians Tourist Steering
Group.
Mr Binnie claims that, before the group was due to meet on Monday of
this week, he was taken aside by Councillor Tom Ferguson, chairman of
East Lothian District Council leisure and tourism committee, and told
off.
He alleges that next day Brian Gall, director of leisure and tourism
for the district council, sent a fax to the conveners and chief
executives of all local authorities on the steering group, pulling the
carpet from under him.
The alleged fax, said Mr Binnie, made clear that he had submitted his
own nomination and that it had ''not been supported nor endorsed'' by
East Lothian District Council.
Mr Binnie said yesterday: ''I was thoroughly humiliated. I knew
nothing of the secret fax message until I arrived at the group meeting
in Edinburgh. My position was quite untenable, and I have had no option
but to resign as chairman of the local tourist board.''
He added: ''Nominations for chairmanship of the steering group were
never discussed at any time by Mr Ferguson or with the district
council.''
Mr Binnie, who owns Kilspindie House Hotel, in Aberlady, East Lothian,
was re-elected chairman of the tourist board last October without
criticism from the district council.
An angry Councillor Ferguson firmly denied he had been abusive to Mr
Binnie or that a ''secret'' fax had been sent to other local
authorities.
''I am saddened by the whole episode. This is a small area, and Mr
Binnie well knew the policy strategy we were taking in regard to the new
unitary authority structure and tourism,'' he said.
''Without consultation with us, he sought to change it on his own and
nominate himself for the position of steering group chairman.
''My concern was that the wrong message was being sent to our
colleagues on the other authorities.''
A statement issued by East Lothian District Council yesterday
regretted that Mr Binnie had found it necessary to resign. It challenged
his version of events and denied any question of a secret fax.
The statement said Mr Ferguson had been ''justifiably angry'' at Mr
Binnie's decision to nominate himself when he knew the district council
would not support him.
It added that Mr Ferguson had ''every right to be angry'' towards Mr
Binnie but denied he was mistreated verbally.

THE Prime Minister is expected to discuss the fate of jailed
paratrooper Private Lee Clegg at a Cabinet meeting today.
The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, will report on the
possibility of releasing the 26-year-old soldier on licence.
It is also reported that he could be moved from Wakefield jail to a
lower security open prison.
Mr Major is taking a close personal interest in the case after the
House of Lords dismissed Clegg's appeal last week and expressed concerns
about definitions of murder and the mandatory life sentence.
Home Secretary Michael Howard is to carry out a review of the law on
murder after the Law Lords' ruling.
A petition with about 60,000 signatures calling for Clegg's release
will be handed into Downing Street today.
Accompanying the sacks of mail will be veterans of the Arnhem campaign
and wheelchair-bound residents of the original Cheshire home for the
severely disabled, opened by the late war hero Leonard Cheshire VC.
The first batch of 40,000 letters collected by the Sunday Express were
handed into Downing Street yesterday by Clegg's mother, Mrs Wynne
Johnson, and her second husband, Jack.
However, the couple's hopes of meeting Mr Major were dashed. Asked if
she was disappointed, Mrs Johnson said: ''Yes we are, but never mind, we
have done the next best thing.''
Asked how optimistic she was about an early release for her son, she
pointed heavenward and said: ''I don't know. It's up to Him up there.''
Her husband said: ''We just hope it will be sooner rather than
later.''
Legal and political moves were stepped up amid growing public sympathy
and support for Clegg, who has served three-and-a-half years of his life
sentence.
It was announced that the Commons will debate the Rules of Engagement
for security forces in Northern Ireland next Wednesday.
Clegg, one of 15 paratroopers who fired at a car driven by joyriders
which failed to stop at a roadblock, was convicted after the court heard
that he continued firing after the vehicle passed through the
checkpoint.
MPs are also putting pressure on the Government for a speedy release.
Some 105 Tory MPs have signed an emergency motion expressing dismay at
Clegg's position.
The Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, and the Clegg
family's constituency MP, Gerry Sutcliffe (Labour, Bradford South), last
night met Sir Patrick to discuss the case.
Ms Mowlam said they had received an assurance that if the question
arose of Clegg's release on licence, Sir Patrick ''would not let
bureaucratic procedures delay the process unnecessarily''.
Members of the public are continuing to sign petitions. Former Para
Colonel Peter Field, a member of the Free Clegg Committee, said more
than 100,000 signatures had come in already.
A phone-in petition organised by ITV had generated a further 200,000
responses, he said. Teletext viewers showed overwhelming support in a
telephone poll for Clegg to be pardoned. Of the 4435 calls received, 95%
of callers said he should be pardoned.
Mail is also pouring in to Wakefield jail, where Clegg is serving his
sentence. So far he has received 1500 letters -- each of which has to be
censored before he can see it.

EXCLUSIVE
NEW evidence that Government officials were alerted to the export of
potentially lethal naval weaponry to the Iraqis by a Scottish firm in
the run-up to the Gulf war has been uncovered by The Herald.
For the first time, proof can be shown that 10 acoustic detonators
were sent to the Iraqi navy by Global Technology for use in triggering
advanced sea mines by remote control.
The detonators were ordered through the Edinburgh offices of Oceano
Instruments UK. They were exported to Iraq by Global, which was run by
directors Allan Mellor and Mel Blackburn, months before the invasion of
Kuwait.
Global had a #3.4m mine clearance contract with Iraq, which also
involved training Iraqi naval personnel in the use of such weaponry.
Mr Kelso Riddle, the Oceano director who sold the detonators to Global
believing they were to be used for mine clearance, claims he warned the
Ministry of Defence of his growing suspicions that the Iraqis planned to
adapt them to detonate advanced sea mines by remote control.
Mr Riddle says it was four months before his warnings were heeded. He
was eventually flown to the Gulf where he assisted Royal Navy mine
clearance experts to locate and destroy the detonators attached to
advanced sea mines. Not all were found, he says.
Mr Riddle has office records to show that he discussed the possibility
of an export licence for the detonators on a number of occasions with an
official at the Department of Trade and Industry.
He has not, so far, been asked to give evidence to the Arms-to-Iraq
inquiry, headed by Sir Richard Scott. It was set up in the wake of the
Matrix Churchill trial, which disclosed evidence of government
complicity in the sale of arms to Iraq.
Details of a Herald investigation of Global's #3.4m mine clearance
contract, in 1990, were requested by the Scott inquiry last July.
Sir Richard is now studying details of the contract which, as The
Herald showed, had profound defence implications. It involved the
transfer of high technology sea-survey, explosives, and mine clearance
equipment to Iraq.
The ostensible aim of the contract was to clear strategic waterways of
debris after the Iran/Iraq war. However, the Iraqis were rebuilding
their war arsenal and were scouring the arms world for acoustic
detonators to give them the capability of blowing up enemy ships from a
distance.
Inquiries revealed that the British Embassy in Baghdad was aware of
the contract. This was eventually, and reluctantly, confirmed. However,
the Government refused to say whether the Department of Trade and
Industry or the Foreign Office had been alerted to its defence
implications.
Yesterday Mr Riddle told how he contacted the DTI to ask about an
export licence for the acoustic detonators. On more than one occasion,
he said, he explained that they were being imported to the UK for
transfer to Iraq.
When he was told that an export licence was needed, he claims he told
the official he planned to leave it to Global to apply for one. Global
never did. The detonators were flown to Iraq on an Iraqi Airways flight.
Questions about the findings of The Herald investigation into the
contract were raised in Parliament on a number of occasions by the then
Shadow foreign spokesman, Mr George Robertson.
He was told by Ministers that the Global case was ''sub-judice'' and
they could not respond to questions about the contract. A planned
prosecution of the Global directors for illegal export was eventually
dropped.

SELF-STYLED messiah David Koresh began preparing for an armed battle
at his Branch Davidian cult's ranch in Waco, Texas, four months before
the raid that started the siege there, the inquest on the British
victims heard yesterday.
''David would interpret prophecies from the Bible. He told us he had
to prepare for a confrontation,'' said Vicky Hollingsworth, 35, a
British woman who was left unharmed during the siege.
''He began to store weapons and ammunition and organised training for
the men.
''I have been present when David Koresh issued guns to men, women and
children.''
Miss Hollingsworth, in a statement read to the court, said there was a
plan to commit mass suicide during the 51-day siege two years ago.
She said she saw one of the 23 British victims, Evette Fagan, 33, from
Nottingham, give a hand grenade to another woman.
''It was said it would be used to end all our lives together, but the
men told us that was not a sure way,'' she added.
She said another British victim, Paulina Henry, 24, who died with her
mother, two brothers and two sisters, told her there was a plan for a
final shoot out with the FBI. After that, everyone would commit suicide
by blowing up the building.
''That did not happen because David had a vision from God in which he
was told not to do it because God had more work for him to do,'' she
said.
More details of an alleged suicide plan emerged from a videotaped
interview with survivor Marjorie Thomas, 31, from Nottingham.
Interviewed in her hospital bed, where she was suffering from 51%
burns, she said Koresh, 33, ordered that if he died from a gunshot wound
received in the initial raid his followers would place him on a
stretcher and carry it out of the compound.
''We would be translated if the enemies shot at us,'' she said.
Asked what that meant, she explained: ''To come out of our flesh and
go up towards heaven. We were to be translated by fire, tanks, or be
shot.''
Miss Thomas said that if they were not shot by the federal authorities
surrounding the ranch, they were to use grenades to kill themselves.
If some did not have the ''desire or ability'' to do that someone
could help them.
Later a message came from Koresh telling them to wait. He died later
after being shot during the inferno that ended the siege.
A $500m legal action was yesterday filed in the US by relatives of
victims of the siege.
The families want compensation for alleged negligence and
mismanagement by federal officials during the raid.
The hearing continues.

JUNIOR doctors are refusing the offer of employment in a busy
Lanarkshire hospital's accident and emergency unit to the point where it
is threatened with closure.
Just one of eight posts has been filled, causing administrators to
warn patients with minor ailments to stay away and ask local GPs to work
shifts to make up the shortfall.
Ironically, the number of junior doctors is rising throughout the UK
as the Government aims to meet a new deal to reduce the junior doctors'
working hours.
That drive appears to have backfired in Law Hospital's case and
similar if less severe examples of shortfalls in casualty departments
are also being recorded elsewhere.
Working in accident and emergency is one of the most stressful of
duties for junior doctors. But it is no longer a requirement for those
aiming to become consultants.
Inquiries by The Herald suggest that junior doctors -- if accepting
such tours of duty -- now tend towards teaching hospitals or, at the
least, city-based hospitals when they move from post to post every six
months as part of their training.
However, Clydesdale Labour MP Jimmy Hood thinks the threat to accident
and emergency services at Law Hospital, near Carluke, is part of a wider
trend by NHS Trusts to cut costs.
In an early day Commons motion lodged yesterday, he called for an
investigation into the management and accounting practices at the
hospital. He also called on Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the Scottish
Health Minister, to immediately investigate ''this alarming trend which
now threatens the National Health Service in Scotland''.
Mr Hood said: ''It is an absolute outrage. The next thing is that this
trust will be asking people to use do-it-yourself home operation kits.
This is a case of cost cutting and putting the market before medical
care.''
Law Hospital confirmed that only one junior doctor's post for the six
months from February 1 has been filled. Three other posts will be filled
between two weeks and two months later, leaving a shortfall of four
despite national and international advertising since November.
Chief executive Ken Thomson dismissed cost-cutting accusations as
''absolute and utter rubbish'' and said the number of posts below
consultancy level at Law had increased by 25% in the last three years.
Of the shortfall, which in the worst scenario would lead to closure,
he said: ''I think our location does not help and have heard of other
hospitals suffering similar experiences. We pay the national rates, but
a lot of junior doctors, moving around every six months, are choosing
teaching or city hospitals.''
Mr Thomson admitted that people with minor ailments would have longer
waits in casualty, but added anyone with ''cause for concern'' should
continue to attend. He stressed that a 24-hour casualty service would
continue and all emergencies would be dealt with.
A spokesman for Lord Fraser said there was no substance to the
allegations that a funding crisis was to blame for the shortfall.

THREE young Rolls-Royce trainees from Scotland were in Birmingham last
night to receive the company's Chairman's Award from Sir Ralph Robins,
having beaten teams from other R-R plants all over the country in the
annual technical competition.
Two of the trio -- graduate trainee Colin Jones and undergraduate
trainee Morag Fraser -- work in the research and aero engine design
facility at East Kilbride, where all 600 staff, including them, face
redundancy by the end of this year.
The third team member, engineering apprentice Colin Barr, works in the
overhaul facility next door, which is not affected by last week's
closure announcement. But his father, Richard, who was present at the
dinner last night, works as a section leader on the closure-threatened
design side.
This is the fourth time in six years that a team from East Kilbride
has walked off with the Chairman's Award, given for work on a technical
project capable of being introduced into engine design or production.
The awards dinner, at the Metropole Hotel near the National Exhibition
Centre in Birmingham, was attended by senior engineering staff and
Rolls-Royce directors.
Reflecting on the irony of last night's event, a statement from the
joint shop stewards committee at East Kilbride said: ''The record of
East Kilbride's success in the Chairman's Award demonstrates the plant
produces high calibre engineers who have helped it obtain an exemplary
reputation not only within Rolls-Royce, but in all sectors of the
aerospace industry worldwide.''
Mr Graham Irvine, a senior shop steward, said of the awards ceremony:
''It must embarrass the Rolls-Royce board quite considerably that this
event is taking place at the moment.''
Company officials yesterday appeared to be all too aware of the irony
of the situation, and did not welcome The Herald's interest in giving
coverage to the East Kilbride trainees' triumph.
Asked if it would be possible to arrange a picture or a phone
interview with the trio at the hotel in Birmingham, a Rolls-Royce
spokesman said: ''We prefer not to do that.'' It was an annual event for
the benefit of trainees and there was usually no media involvement.

THE troubled Yorkhill Hospital Trust in Glasgow -- still the focus of
a police investigation after the death of a toddler at the weekend --
has run up a #215,000 overspend, it was revealed yesterday.
Staff at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children -- already under
pressure following a series of highly publicised mishaps -- fear
cutbacks because of the deficit.
However, last night the trust's chief executive, Mr Gerry Marr, was
confident all would be well by the end of the financial year. ''We are
in line to meet the financial targets set by the Government -- there is
no requirement on us to curtail activity,'' he said.
Increased costs in the pharmacy budget and a shortfall of #120,000 in
income have contributed to the #215,000 shortfall, but Mr Marr expects
the trust to be breaking even by April.
He admitted: ''We are not awash with cash by any means -- our finances
are pretty tightly balanced. We would not expect it to be otherwise for
a hospital in Greater Glasgow where the health board's share of the
Scottish Office allocation is still being reduced.''
Mr Marr said he had been assured by his director of nursing that
staffing levels -- currently under public scrutiny because of recent
incidents at the hospital -- were appropriate to maintain safe cover.
''Having been a nurse myself, I know it is always a professional
desire to have the ideal situation, and I realise nurses have concerns
about the level of resources available to us.
''We negotiated an extra #400,000 for nursing resources last year and
this will go up to an extra #800,000 this year,'' he added.
But there had been difficulty recruiting nurses of the right grades
for seven new beds which are being opened next month with the intention
of reducing pressure on the hospital during winter outbreaks of
Respiratory Syncytial Virus.
One nurse said yesterday: ''It is common knowledge that there is a
staff shortage. I think nurses are under a lot of pressure to perform at
high levels, and it is hard to do that when you know there is a lot of
work banking up behind you.''
Mr Marr said it was a coincidence that a cluster of untoward incidents
had occurred over the past few weeks to threaten Yorkhill's reputation
as a leading children's hospital.
These include two instances where boys who were sent home were found
on further examination to have brain tumours -- the hospital has been
assured by specialists that these are frequently not diagnosed
immediately.
But they apologised unreservedly over a later incident when a child
who suffered a head injury at a funfair was stitched and sent home
without seeing a doctor.
Police are still investigating the latest incident, the death of
two-year-old Christina Murtagh on Sunday, the day after she was found in
a toilet cubicle in the ward where she was a patient.
Detectives are trying to piece together how Christina made her way
from the ward play area about 16 yards along the ward to the bathroom
and toilet suite beside the nursing station and got in through the swing
doors.
The security implications have prompted the Yorkhill managers to
compare their own standards with those of other UK paediatric units. Mr
Marr said: ''We are all trying to find the right balance between
security and freedom of access for parents and other visitors.''
Yorkhill has spent #250,000 on security measures in the past two
years, he added. The next moves being considered are restricted entry
after a certain time at night and identity badges for parents who are
resident within the hospital.

A NATIONWIDE hunt was under way yesterday for a woman and two
pensioners who are wanted in connection with a series of alleged frauds
carried out all over the country, and who hurriedly left a rented
cottage.
The search for Ms Angela Dodge, 51, follows complaints by hotels,
garages, and banks from Inverness to Somerset.
She was also bailed by a court in Ireland for allegedly committing a
bank fraud in September 1993. But since then, Ms Dodge, who travels with
Ms Joan Payne, 74, and Ms Winifred Bristow, 76 -- the aunts of a former
lover -- has evaded police.
She is also thought to be with her 12-year-old daughter, Katrina.
Ms Dodge, for whom there were searches in 1992 and 1993, rented a
converted farmhouse near Folkstone, Kent, two weeks ago, claiming to be
writing a book.
But the letting agent became suspicious and informed police.
Police said three women and a young girl were seen driving off
yesterday on the A260 in an old blue Volvo 245 estate car with the Irish
numberplate 9AZ1.
Police believe they might have been going to Canterbury to see
relatives.
Constable Barry Woodley, of Hampshire Police, said yesterday: ''We've
got to find them this time. This escapade has gone on long enough.''

A PSYCHIATRIC hospital is carrying out an inquiry into how an insane
killer choked himself to death while being kept in maximum security.
William Gilchrist, 30, was found dead at Hartwood Hospital where he
was receiving treatment.
He had been transferred from the State Hospital at Carstairs and was
being cared for in a top security wing at Hartwood, near Harthill in
Lanarkshire.
Gilchrist appeared at the High Court in August, 1988, charged with
murdering his mother.
But he was found to be unfit to plead by a judge who ordered him to be
detained without limit of time at Carstairs.
Gilchrist was believed to have somehow deliberately choked himself to
death last Saturday -- despite being on round-the-clock surveillance.
Yesterday, Professor Frank Clark, general manager at Lanarkshire
Health Board, said: ''We are naturally concerned about this most
unfortunate incident and are still looking at the circumstances
surrounding this patient's death.
''I have been assured that the staff on duty, both in numbers and
skills mix, at the time of the incident, was entirely appropriate for
the number and dependency of the patients being cared for.''
But the Labour MP for Motherwell North, Dr John Reid, said yesterday
he was alarmed and concerned at the suicide as he understood Mr
Gilchrist was a maximum security patient.
He will be contacting the health board to demand that a full
investigation is carried out as speedily as possible.
Dr Reid said: ''I am particularly keen to ensure that this very sad
loss of life did not occur because of staff shortages and I am seeking
assurances from the health board about this.''
A full report on the incident has been sent to the procurator-fiscal.

THE Social Security Secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, who has spent the past

junior Ministers.
It landed Mr Major with a fresh row, as Labour demanded to know
whether it reflected Government policy. ''Mr Lilley has been taking
money away from the poor and now he wants more money for Tory
Ministers,'' Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said.
Mr Lilley claimed salaries of junior Ministers were so low
(#47,987-a-year) that MPs with family commitments could not afford to
take up the jobs. He added that he believed MPs should be paid less.
Meanwhile, the CBI announced its panel investigating directors' pay.
Chaired by Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, it will
include the chairmen of Whitbread and Boots, ICI and Zeneca, GKN, and
BT, as well as Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute

A MOTHER was yesterday awarded #35,000 compensation. She had resigned
from ScottishPower because she felt she was being treated like ''a piggy
in the middle'' by the company after it turned down repeated requests to
job share.
A Glasgow industrial tribunal awarded the money to Mrs Susan Given, of
East Kilbride, after ruling that she had been discriminated against by
ScottishPower, her employer since starting work as a clerical officer in
1979.
The award is believed to be the highest in Scotland for sexual
discrimination, excluding the recent cases against the Ministry of
Defence.
Mrs Given, 33, said yesterday she was ''overjoyed'' at the tribunal's
decision, claiming it as a victory after what she described as ''a long
frustrating process of to-ing and fro-ing''.
The tribunal heard Mrs Given had worked hard to establish a career
after joining the company at 18 and had progressed to implementation
team member in the customer services department in Glasgow, responsible
for supervising the work of 10 or 12 colleagues.
When she fell pregnant with her daughter, Rachael, now 18-months-old,
she approached her customer services manager in March 1993 to suggest a
job share as she knew of others in the company who had successfully
operated this.
She was told, the tribunal had heard in evidence, that the idea was a
''non-starter'' for staff at her level.
Mrs Given said yesterday: ''Basically I was caught as piggy in the
middle. I was too low a grade to qualify for a career break and too high
a grade to qualify for job sharing.''
Following investigation, it was decided her request to work from home
was not feasible and other alternative options such as a career break,
part-time working, or voluntary severance were not viable either. The
issue was postponed when Mrs Given left for maternity leave.
On her return to work in January 1994, Mrs Given again raised the
question of job sharing and was referred to the personnel department.
She was eventually told a pilot job-sharing scheme for her level would
not be considered. She decided to resign her #18,766 post, leaving the
company in May of last year and bringing them before the tribunal.
The tribunal, which heard that at least 12 ScottishPower employees
worked this way, held that no operational bar existed to the successful
implementation of a job share for Mrs Given's position. It awarded her
#5000 for injury to her feelings and #30,000 for present and future
salary loss until Rachael reaches school age.
Mrs Given, described by ScottishPower yesterday as an excellent
employee, now works on a job share with Strathclyde Regional Council,
earning #4500 a year as a clerical officer.
A ScottishPower spokesman said last night the company was considering
an appeal.
''We do operate job sharing arrangements but only on the basis that
each application is treated on its merits taking into account the
company's requirement to maintain effective operations,'' said Mr Mike
Hollis, employee relations planning manager.

A PART-TIME banking job, worth #50,000 a year, for former Cabinet
Minister Lord Wakeham yesterday intensified the ''jobs for the boys''
row, involving bloated wages for politicians and businessmen connected
with privatisation.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown led the assault immediately the
merchant bankers Rothschild, which has brokered Tory privatisation and
played a key role in the electricity sell-off, announced the former
Energy Secretary's appointment to the board as a non-executive director.
Lord Wakeham, a Mr Fix-It in the Thatcher governments, is also the new
chairman of the Press Complaints Commission: salary, #55,000-a-year for
a three-day week.
Mr Brown wrote to Lord Nolan, who is conducting an inquiry into
standards in public life, urging him to rule on the flow of ex-Ministers
into jobs with companies they privatised.
Mr Brown said yesterday: ''Lord Wakeham only left the Cabinet six
months ago and now he is to sit on the board of one of the biggest
beneficiaries of privatisation. These conflicts of interest cannot be
allowed to continue.''
He went on: ''The Cabinet room is becoming a recruiting ground for the
boards of privatised companies: now Lord Wakeham's number has come up in
the National Lottery of jobs for the boys. It is wrong to be involved in
the privatised industries one year and benefit from the privatisation
the next.
Lord Wakeham is the latest in a series of former Cabinet Ministers to
join top firms in the city and industry.
Former Chancellor Norman Lamont is already on the board at Rothschild.
Lord Tebbit, who privatised British Telecom, joined the BT board after
leaving the Government.
Lord Walker who, as Energy Secretary, arranged gas privatisation is
now on the board of British Gas.
Former Trade Secretary Lord Young, who regulated Cable and Wireless,
is now the chairman of the company.
On Tuesday, former Transport Secretary John MacGregor was being
interrogated by the Nolan Committee about his move to merchant bankers
Hill Samuel after his resignation from the Government last year.
The Wakeham appointment by Rothschild, involved as underwriters or
advisers to the Government in all the big privatisations from British
Telecom in 1984 to British Coal last year, was not referred to the Prime
Minister. Downing Street yesterday was attempting to play down the
issue.
Lord Wakeham quit as Energy Secretary five years ago after he
completed the privatisation of electricity, started by Lord Parkinson.
Ministers took the view that since five years have passed, there is no
embarrassment now in his taking the Rothschild job as a chartered
accountant and expert businessman.
Bank chairman Sir Evelyn de Rothschild said the appointment would
''broaden and deepen'' the board's experience.
Lord Wakeham resigned from the Government last summer as Leader in the
House of Lords.
Party chairman Jeremy Hanley accused the Labour Party of hypocrisy.
''Just because Lord Wakeham, a qualified chartered accountant and
businessman, leaves Government and returns to business, Labour try out
their 'guilt by accusation' smear again.''
He added: ''When did Labour ever say it was wrong for Ted Short,
former deputy Prime Minister to go out of Government into the
chairmanship of Cable and Wireless, or Edmond Dell, former Secretary for
Trade into a chief executive post at Guiness Peat and director of Shell
Transport and Trading or Terence Boston, former Home Office Minister,
into TVS entertainment?''
He said Ministers leaving office, Labour or Tory, had a legitimate
right to take up their business concerns. ''They did then, and they do
now.''
Lord Wakeham himself remained silent on the issue. He left the Press
Complaints Commission offices in London, refusing to answer questions.
More than an hour earlier two secretaries had emerged from the
building to tell waiting reporters and photographers that Lord Wakeham
had left by a side exit. But he was known to be presiding over a
meeting. Eventually he appeared and dashed into a chauffeur-driven car,
avoiding cameras.
The Tories are keen to defuse the accusations from Labour that this is
another example of Tory ''sleaze''. The Wakeham appointment hits the
Prime Minister at a particularly embarrassing time when the new heads of
privatised industries like Gas and Electricity are being revealed to
have taken massive pay rises, share options, and perks.
The Liberal Democrat spokesman, Mr Nick Harvey, joined in the
attack.''Lord Wakeham stood down from the Cabinet last July with a
#13,000 payment to soften the blow,'' he said. ''Now, just six months
later, he has taken a non-executive directorship at Rothschild for an
estimated #50,000 salary.
''Yet again we are seeing ex-Tory Ministers lining their pockets on
the back of experience gained and contacts gleaned during their time in
office.''

A SYSTEM of car parking charges looks set to divide members of
Highland Regional Council at a meeting in Inverness later this morning.
The present system has meant that motorists in Inverness pay all year
round for use of council car parks and bays, those in Fort William pay
only in the summer months, while elsewhere in the region residents and
tourists enjoy free parking all year.
On May 26, it was decided by the roads and transport committee that
seasonal charging for some parking should be extended to other areas
centres of population in Nairn, Dingwall, Tain, Portree, Wick, Thurso,
and Fort Augustus.
It was estimated this could raise #80,000 which could go to reduce the
#600,000 deficit on the car park account.
The council ratified the decision on June 30, but now 20 of the 54
councillors have signed a motion calling on the council to reverse its
decision.
They also want the council to ''review the need for and level of car
parking charges in Inverness and Fort William to reflect only traffic
management considerations''.
Tain Councillor Alasdair Rhind, who is leading the opposition to the
new charges and is vice-chairman of the roads and transport committee

MR Robin Cook came to the aid of his leader yesterday with a
powerfully argued speech in favour of rewriting Clause 4 of Labour's
constitution.
The Shadow Foreign Secretary confessed he had not been an enthusiast
when Mr Tony Blair announced his intention of scrapping what for many
party members is the Ark of the Covenant at last year's party
conference.
Critics of the leader claimed the internal row is responsible for a
Mori poll in this morning's Times showing the Tories slightly narrowing
the gap between the parties for the first time since last July. Labour
has 56% compared with 61% in mid December. The Conservatives have moved
up a little to 27% from 22%, and the Liberal Democrats are up one at
14%.
Mr Cook, sponsored by the rail union RMT, said that as the debate
developed and he thought about it, he had come to the conclusion it
would be possible to replace the clause with a statement of aims ''that
would be more radical in its values and more exciting as a political
programme''.
His persuasively argued speech to the soft left pressure group, the
Labour Co-ordinating Committee, could sway many on Labour's left and
should greatly help Mr Blair who today launches his nationwide campaign
to sell the idea of reform.
Mr Cook's conversion, however, was fiercely criticised by defenders of
the clause, some of whom suggested he had been pressed into taking
centre stage to try to boost a campaign they say has been losing support
since it was launched.
Mr Cook, however, is a notably independent thinker and a hard man to
pressurise: he said those who drafted the clause would probably want to
change it themselves if they were still around.
''It is a negation of socialist theory to rely for our political
programmes on the commandments as revealed to a drafting committee of
the past.''
However, the dramatic conversion to the cause of modernising the
constitution will not be enough to avert a bloody showdown at the
forthcoming Scottish conference at Inverness, it was judged last night,
and to some who regard the 1918 drafters as a kind of collective Moses
bringing down the tablets of socialist truth, it was heresy.
The left-wing MP for Glasgow Hillhead, Mr George Galloway, said that
as someone who respected Mr Cook, it was ''more in sorrow than in
anger'' he criticised yesterday's intervention in the debate as
''disingenuous''.
According to Falkirk East MP Michael Connarty, some of Mr Cook's hints
and pointers about what might replace the historic clause on public
ownership were along the right lines, but there had to be ''far more
meat on the bones'' and the intervention would not head off the looming
conflict at Inverness in March.
There are 26 motions on the table for the Scottish conference, all
hostile to some degree to Mr Blair's intention to scrap the clause, seen
by Scots party activists as embodying the historic soul of the party.
Mr Alan Simpson, MP for Nottingham South, a leading member of the
Defend Clause 4 Campaign, said the bid to sell the reform was ''almost
like the Emperor's new clothes parade. It does the party no good. I
think it does the individuals concerned no good''.
Labour's national executive yesterday decided local parties are to be
encouraged to ballot members about the clause.
Mr Cook pointed out that Clause 4, inscribed on every membership card,
contained no commitment to tackling inequality, women's rights,
unemployment, centralisation of power or improving the environment.
There was no mention of public services like housing, health, or
education.

FOOTBALL manager Tommy McLean told a court yesterday that a #25,000
''take it or leave it'' offer was to be made to player Tom Boyd when it
seemed his transfer from Motherwell to Chelsea was deadlocked.
Mr Boyd, 29, is suing his former club Motherwell for #50,000 following
his #750,000 move to the London side in 1991.
The footballer, now with Celtic, claims he is still owed the cash
following negotiations with the Lanarkshire club in the lead up to him
signing for Chelsea. Motherwell dispute this.
Mr McLean, 47, was then manager at Motherwell in the season Mr Boyd
captained the side to Scottish Cup victory.
He said the player's agent, Mr Dennis Roache, made it clear Mr Boyd
would not be re-signing because his expectations could not be
accommodated in the club's wage structure.
Chelsea and Nottingham Forrest approached Motherwell over Mr Boyd,
whose contract ran out on June 30, 1991.
Motherwell stood to lose money if he moved when his contract was
finished because a transfer tribunal was liable to fix a lower fee than
the English clubs were prepared to offer.
Nottingham Forest were keen to sign the player in time to play in a
cup match and an English transfer deadline was looming at the end of
March that year.
Mr McLean said that in those circumstances Motherwell decided to make
an offer to the player of #50,000 if he signed for one of the interested
English clubs before the deadline.
However, Mr Boyd, of Bothwell, Lanarkshire, did not sign and the money
was then ''off the table'', said Mr McLean, now manager at Hearts.
The #50,000 was meant to ensure Motherwell were assured of getting a
guaranteed figure for the player and to encourage him to make up his
mind.
Chelsea kept up their interest in Mr Boyd and a meeting was arranged
in Glasgow in May. Representatives of Motherwell and Chelsea, the
player, and his agent all turned up.
Mr McLean said that Chelsea were prepared to pay Motherwell #750,000
for the player at that stage and #50,000 was to be paid to the player by
the club through Motherwell.
He said he did not attend the meeting because of a family bereavement,
but he got a phone call from his club chairman, John Chapman, who said
he was informed the deal was ready to collapse and that the player's
agent had left the meeting after saying he wanted a payment from
Motherwell for the transfer to go ahead.
Mr McLean said he suggested they offer #25,000 to the player on a
''take it or leave it'' basis. If that was not acceptable, Motherwell
should just take their chances at a tribunal.
He was questioned as to whether the #25,000 was to be on top of the
earlier #50,000 offer. Mr McLean said: ''I would definitely dispute
that.''
The hearing, before Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, continues.

EXCLUSIVE
A RIFT has developed in the Scottish National Party over policy on
public ownership of utilities, with a leading proponent of a strong
public sector refusing to serve on a committee chaired by a former
Conservative.
The debate within the SNP mirrors the Labour Party's agonising over
Clause 4 of its constitution, as Nationalists refine their stance on
common or public ownership of key utilities against a backdrop of
controversy over cuts in services by privatised enterprises, job losses
and sky-high pay awards for chief executives.
The SNP decided to establish a committee to develop party policy on
public utilities and invited the former Labour MP, Mr Dick Douglas, to
join, on the strength of a hard-hitting analysis he carried out last
September.
But when he was told that a chairman had already been selected for the
committee -- former Tory Iain Lawson -- Mr Douglas declined to
participate in the exercise.
Mr Douglas stressed yesterday that his disagreement was over the
principle of joining a committee whose chairman had already been
appointed, rather than any difference of opinion with Mr Lawson, a
fellow national executive committee member.
However, it is understood that among some SNP activists the
appointment of a former high-profile Conservative such as Mr Lawson to
chair the committee has been greeted with dismay, seeing it as a
potential hostage to fortune in future public debate with the Labour
Party.
Whatever new policy finally emerges from the committee, it is felt
that at a time when the Scottish political scene is dominated by the
battle between Labour and the SNP, it will be easy for Labour activists
to use Mr Lawson's chairmanship to decry ''Tartan Tories'' and deflect
attention away from their own debate about historical principles.
''I have very distinct views on the ownership and control of public
utilities,'' said Mr Douglas.
''What I am not going to do is go on any committee when I am told the
composition and chairmanship is pre-determined. It is nothing to do with
personalities or the guy involved.''
The party's policy vice-convener, Mr Alex Neil, said: ''The membership
of the working party was approved by the national council in December.
That includes representatives of every branch, and not one objection was
raised by anyone.''
Mr Lawson said last night he was on record for a number of years on
opposing privatisation of utilities, a view he had come to after
watching the rundown of the Scottish steel industry after it passed out
of public hands.
''My view is that things such as water should be nowhere but the
public sector,'' he said.
Of his chairmanship of the committee, he said: ''It has always been
the job of the vice-convener for policy to appoint members to working
groups.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang is battling to retain Scottish rail
services under threat from planned rail privatisation, writes Stephen
McGregor.
He is particularly concerned about Motorail, sleeper, and special
summer services for backpackers, hillwalkers and other tourists.
It had been assumed that decisions had been taken on Motorail and the
other services ahead of privatisation, but it became clear last night
that Mr Lang was still trying to intervene to defend the Scottish
network.
He held a meeting on Tuesday with British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid,
and while no details have emerged, it is understood that in a frank
exchange Mr Lang fought Scotland's corner.
Westminster sources claimed last night that ''nothing was signed,
sealed and delivered'' in terms of rail services in Scotland.
Mr Lang could now faces a Cabinet battle.

MARGARET Baird celebrated her 101st birthday yesterday with a
half-hour flying lesson.
Mrs Baird was born in 1894, the year Gladstone retired from
Parliament, and vividly remembers the news of Queen Victoria's death.
When the Wright brothers made their first flight in December 1903, she
was nine years old.
Yesterday she climbed into a four-seater Piper Warrior at Dundee
Airport and, before taking over the controls, insisted that her
instructor, Philip Hughes, should fly over Tayport, where she has lived
all her life.
'I'm not nervous at all,'' she said. ''I flew in a Dakota during the
war -- and anything has to be better than that. I like going flying and
have been to Holland, Jersey and Ireland by plane before.''
After her lesson she said: ''I took the controls and absolutely loved
it. I enjoyed flying over Tayport, and waved to my friends in Broughty
Ferry.''
Mr Hughes, 27, said: ''Mrs Baird is an amazing lady. She wasn't
nervous at all -- and neither was I.''
Mrs Baird, a non-smoker and teetotaller, shares a house with her
daughter, and has a hectic social life. She worked as a servant to
support her five daughters after her husband was gassed at
Passchendaele.
''I have had a wonderful life,'' she said. ''I have five daughters,
14grandchildren and 15 great-grand children.''

A SON of Mr Arnold Clark, the millionaire motor dealer, was found dead
yesterday after police attended his Helensburgh home.
Senior officers said late last night his death was being treated as a
tragic accident. Earlier, officers said the death was being treated as
suspicious and they were awaiting the result of a post-mortem
examination.
Police found the body of Mr Norman Clark, 33, one of four sons from Mr
Arnold Clark's first marriage, when they went to his house in Lever
Road, near Helensburgh Golf Club, just after 6.30am in response to a 999
call. An ambulance also attended.
Police investigations were concentrated yesterday within the
three-bedroom detached villa which had been freshly painted on the
outside. A uniformed policeman stood guard at the front door.
Two forensic officers carried out an examination of the house.
Mr Raymond Hepburn, control manager with the Scottish Ambulance
Service in the Argyll and Clyde area, later confirmed to The Herald:
''We attended a collapse call at the location at 6.43am this morning.
However, we did not remove any patient. The case is now in police
hands.''
Mr Clark was divorced and had two sons. He is thought to have stayed
at the house with his friend and work colleague, Ms Alice Robinson. They
moved in last September.
He was a salesman with the Partick-based McHarg, Rennie and Lindsay
group, one of more than 70 franchises run by the Arnold Clark
Organisation throughout the UK.
He is understood to have called in sick to his work on Tuesday
morning.
No-one at the showroom would comment yesterday. A spokeswoman at the
St George's Road branch in Glasgow would only say: ''All we know is that
there has been a bereavement in the family. I have been told not to
comment further.''
A staff member at a local Texaco petrol station used by salesmen from
McHarg, Rennie and Lindsay said he was shocked to learn of Mr Clark's
death. ''He always appeared a very pleasant and outgoing chap on his
regular visits here,'' he said.
Neighbours on the Glade estate in the Clyde resort town yesterday said
the family had ''kept themselves to themselves''.
One neighbour said she had been wakened by an ambulance and several
police cars drawing up in the street early yesterday. But she said she
had heard no disturbance before then.
Mr Clark was said to have been ''a quiet and reserved young man'' who
kept a low profile in the community.
One motor dealer said yesterday: ''If he had been Jack the Lad or
something then he would have been talked about, but he wasn't.
''Although he worked in the business, he didn't have a major public
profile. This is a real tragedy for the Clarks, and we sympathise with
them.''
Friends and relatives of the dead man gathered yesterday in Killearn,
Stirlingshire, at the sprawling home of his father, Arnold, 67, and his
second wife, Philomena.
A woman who was vetting callers at the door of the home said:
'''Norman was a lovely man. He had a twin brother called Neil. Everyone
here is stunned by what's happened.''
The couple were said to be devasted by the tragedy. They have two sons
and four daughters, John, Adam, Celia, Lucy, Stephanie, and Amy.
Mr Arnold Clark has risen from humble beginnings to become one of the
biggest motor operators in the UK. The Clark family are well-known in
Helensburgh and are members of the exclusive Royal Northern and Clyde
Yacht Club at Rhu.
The couple owned the ''jinxed'' eight-metre yacht Drum England which
used to belong to Duran Duran lead singer Simon Le Bon. It was involved
in a number of accidents and unfortunate incidents at sea.
Mr Clark was a steelworker's son who was conscripted for the RAF at
the end of the Second World War and was trained as a mechanic. With some
technical knowledge behind him, he returned to Glasgow and began buying
cars.
By 1954 he had accumulated enough capital to open his first showroom,
in Park Road, Glasgow. He gained his first franchise from Morris five
years later. He has since risen to become the owner of Scotland's
largest multi-franchise car-selling group and also has interests in
England.
Contract hire and vehicle repairs and servicing is also a major part
of the business.

<HEADLINE>Why I changed my mind over clause 4</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBIN COOK</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980173111</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Last night ROBIN COOK, the Shadow Foreign Secretary and key member of
Tony Blair's team, publicly changed his mind. He gave his full backing
to his leader's drive to rewrite Clause 4. In doing so he reversed his
earlier opposition to Blair's strategy; he aligned himself with the
party's modernisers; he explained why collective action has to replace
wholesale nationalisation; and he outlined his own agenda to take Labour
forward to government. This is one of the most important speeches by a
senior Opposition figure since the last general election, signalling far
more than a personal U-turn. It is an eloquent demand for less defeatism
and more positive thinking in Labour's ranks. Here, in extended extracts
from the speech, he presents his own manifesto for Labour.
''THIS is the first time I have set out why I believe Clause 4 must be
brought up to date.
''Many journalists reported at the time of annual conference that I
was not enthusiastic about the project to modernise Clause 4. In all
candour, I have to confess that they were right at the time. However, as
the debate has progressed, I have come to recognise that it would be
possible to replace Clause 4 with a statement of aims that would be more
radical in its values and more exciting as a political programme.
''The case for changing Clause 4 is often made only in terms of
electoral necessity. I want to put those arguments on one side for the
moment. Instead, I will focus on why Socialists should want to change
Clause 4 and why the left should welcome the opportunity to produce a
statement of aims that is a fuller, richer statement of our ideology.
''The foundation of Labour's ideology should rest not on state
ownership but on social solidarity. We know that the quality of life and
the economic opportunity of most individuals depends on the health of
the society in which they live and the communal provision it makes for
its members. That is why we are committed to making a success of public
services such as education, which enables each member of society to
progress to the limit of their ability rather than to the limit of their
purse, or the NHS, which treats each citizen on the basis of need rather
than ability to pay. That is also why we reject extremes of inequality
which undermine social cohesion and promote social division and crime.
''It is because Labour believes that individuals succeed best if they
belong to a healthy society that we can recognise that they must also
relate to a sustainable environment. The new right can only see the
individual in isolation and therefore can offer no theory of how the
behaviour of individuals should be influenced to preserve an environment
which they hold in common rather than own individually. Labour's
ideology recognises the need for common action to preserve a common
environment.
''If a belief in social solidarity is the basis of Labour's ideology,
our commitments to collective action and community provision are its
expression. Labour's programme has always been based on the principle
that common problems are best resolved by a collective solution rather
than individual opt-out.
''Our relationship with the trade unions is based on our common
commitment to collective action. Trade unions are a practical expression
of the principle that by working together people can solve problems that
they are powerless to tackle as individuals. A healthy trade union
movement is of particular importance to democratic Socialists, who have
always rejected the fallacy that the state can impose Socialism, and
have instead wanted the people to have the power to achieve the changes
they choose in their condition. The link between the Labour Party and
the trade unions is not a marriage of convenience but a recognition of a
shared ideology of collective action.
''It is in the context of Labour's belief in social solidarity and our
commitment to collective provision that our policy on common ownership
must be assessed. Common ownership is not the sum of Labour's ideology
and has never represented the totality of our programme. It is only one
of the means by which we can put into effect our commitment to
collective provision.
''Less than a quarter of the workforce is now employed in any
production industry. The fast food service industry employs more people
than most manufacturing sectors. The McDonald's chain raises serious
issues of public regulation, such as the case for a minimum wage, but
does anyone believe any real economic purpose would be served by
nationalising it? It also reminds us that capital today is routinely
global. Nobody suggests we take Nissan or Toyota into public ownership
because that would mean taking Britain out of the global market for
investment.
''There are indeed serious problems in the distribution of ownership
of British industry. The most pressing arises from the dominance of the
capital markets by the financial institutions, which now own 80% of all
shares and are still expanding their proportion. The short-termism of
industrial strategy in Britain has its roots in the behaviour of too
many financial institutions as short-term traders of shares, rather than
committed owners of industry. It would aid industrial efficiency as well
as widen democratic accountability if corporate governance in Britain
recognised that there are other stakeholders in a company than the
shareholders, and that the employees often have a longer-term interest
in the success of the enterprise than most shareholders.
''It is because we believe that the workforce must have a democratic
say in the future of their industry that Labour has never in its history
taken into public ownership any industry against the opposition of its
workforce. The nationalisation of the mines, the steelyards, and the
shipyards were all demanded by the people who worked in them. The
clearest evidence that circumstances have changed since 1918 is that
there is not a long queue of workforces in production, distribution, or
exchange wanting us to take them over. The questions that have been
raised within the Labour movement over Tony Blair's proposal to amend
Clause 4 are as nothing to the wholesale revolt that would greet him if
he proposed to implement it in full.
''This does not mean that there is no place for common ownership in
the modern economy. On the contrary, it is only possible for us to
establish and justify the appropriate role of public ownership once we
admit that we have no real intention of nationalising everything. Common
ownership for the common good is desirable where it is inappropriate to
run an industry in response to market forces. There are two examples of
current controversy, on both of which Labour and an overwhelming
majority of the public are united in their support for public ownership.
''The Post Office commands wide support precisely because it behaves
in a way that is in flat conflict with market theory. It charges a
universal flat tariff for delivery anywhere regardless of the individual
cost, and maintains comprehensive access through the provision of an
outlet in every community regardless of turnover. This structure depends
on an internal cross-subsidy which no private operator would retain and
a statutory monopoly over letter delivery which it would not be proper
to confer on a commercial enterprise. We can justify the case for a
publicly owned Post Office because it is the only way of ensuring that
it is run as a public service rather than as a private business.
''The railway industry is another service which can only operate
efficiently if it is run as a public service. All round the world, mass
transit systems do not operate at a commercial profit. The reason is
simple. The level of fares required to raise a commercial return would
be higher than the marginal cost of driving to work and would drive
passengers on to the roads. The result would be immense extra cost on
the roads budget and serious damage to the local and global environment.
It is cheaper for society to subsidise a public railway system than to
absorb the cost to the roads budget and the environment of a commercial
railway industry.
''The other appropriate role for public ownership is remedying market
failure in order to support the commercial sector of the economy.
Intervention through public ownership in such circumstances is not a
threat to a thriving private sector but a necessary complement to it.
Labour wants to build a strong, growing economy on a positive
partnership between innovative private enterprise and a supportive
public sector.
''Germany owes its mittelstand, its vigorous layer of medium
enterprises, to the KfW, a bank sponsored by the state to fill the gap
in the financial markets of investment capital for small entrepreneurs.
Rolls-Royce remains a world-class engineering company because a
Conservative Government took it into public ownership when the private
financial markets would have let it collapse. Leyland Trucks are still
in production because their site was bought over by Lancashire
Enterprise which was set up by the county council to support local
industry.
''That last example illustrates that there are alternative forms of
common ownership to the Morrisonian model of the national corporation.
Municipal enterprise provides a local identity to common ownership that
makes the enterprise accountable to the community that owns it. The
workers' co-operative is an attractive form of common ownership to
democratic Socialists because it enables the workforce to determine the
future of the enterprise and is a structure which has been adopted by a
number of young people setting up businesses based on their shared
talents. In the post-industrial economy of small, decentralised
enterprises, there is a new opportunity for the growth in common
ownership through a wider use of company structures in which the workers
own the business.
''Public ownership will be retained in Labour's new statement of aims.
The objective is not to drop common ownership but to focus it on the
circumstances where it is appropriate and to see it in the context of
the wider aims of Labour's programme.
''It is confidence that I miss most from the present debate over
Clause 4. There is a dreadful defeatism in clutching to a text from the
past out of fear that we cannot produce anything more relevant to the
present. There is no need for that fear. We can produce a statement of
aims that would be relevant, radical, and popular. All that it takes is
the self-confidence that we have a message for our times and that we can
express it in terms that we can share with the people.
''I believe that there is a greater hunger than for half a century for
Labour's message of a community that works together to secure
opportunity for those who can take it and fairness for those that
cannot. Now is the time for Labour to show those who want to hear our
message that we have the self-confidence to write it afresh for today's
society. I have not a moment's doubt that, if Sidney Webb and the rest
of the drafting committee of 1918 were with us now, they would demand we
put a stop to worshipping their work for the past and get on with
producing a text for the present.''

MANCHESTER United footballer Eric Cantona was last night involved in a
fracas with a spectator, watched by millions of television viewers. The
confrontation, during which the Frenchman jumped over the perimeter
fence and appeared to launch a two-footed lunge at the fan, came after
he was sent off.
Later, Scotland Yard said officers were investigating an allegation of
assault against a Manchester United player by ''at least one
spectator''. The scenes occurred during United's match against Crystal
Palace at the London club's Selhurst Park ground, which ended 1-1.
United's England midfielder, Paul Ince, also faces investigation after
he appeared to become involved in the melee which followed the
48th-minute dismissal of the Frenchman. Cantona was shown on television
making his way back to the dressing room under the taunts of Palace
fans, one of whom made an obscene gesture.
Cantona leaped over the fence and Ince led some United players to the
spot in support of their team mate. Cantona appeared to have tea thrown
over him by spectators as goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel escorted him to
the dressing room, where police allowed him to shower and dress before
taking him to a local station. He was later released without being
charged.

A GIN and tonic taken from the home of Safeway poison case accused
Paul Agutter shortly after his wife became ill contained a high level of
the deadly drug atropine, a court heard yesterday.
Someone who drank half a glassful of the contaminated drink would have
ingested 288 times the normal therapeutic dose of atropine, Dr Howard
Okely told the High Court in Edinburgh.
Dr Okely, 48, said that he had also examined a bottle of Safeway diet
tonic found at the Agutters' home at Kilduff Lodge, Athelstaneford, East
Lothian. It contained atropine at a concentration of 103 milligrammes
per litre.
Dr Okely was giving evidence on the third day of the trial of Dr Paul
Agutter who denies attempting to murder his wife Alexandria, 39, at
their home on August last year by putting atropine in a glass of gin and
tonic.
Agutter also denies endangering the lives of eight people who drank
tonic water contaminated with atropine allegedly placed by him on the
shelves of the Safeway Supermarket at Swanston in Edinburgh on August
24.
Dr Okely said that he had examined a number of the bottles of tonic
water.
He said the bottles all contained atropine ranging in concentrations
from 74 milligrammes per litre down to 11 milligrammes.
However the concentration in the bottle found in the Agutter
household, Dr Okely accepted, was significantly lower than the level
found in the gin and tonic taken from the house.
0 He agreed with Advocate-depute Andrew Lamb that the concentration of
atropine found in the gin and tonic sample taken from Kilduff Lodge was
''far in excess'' of any other found during his tests.
Shown a glass taken from the Agutter household, Dr Okely said that if
it had been half full of the gin and tonic, anyone who drank the full
amount would have ingested about 49 milligrammes of atropine.
Cross-examined by defence counsel Mr Neil Murray, QC, Dr Okely said
that assuming the drink was half gin and half tonic it would have been
necessary to add atropine to the drink to get to the concentration of
292 milligrammes per litre.
On Tuesday, the court heard evidence from Dr Agutter's wife,
Alexandria, that she felt ''pretty weird'' after drinking about two
inches from a glass of gin and tonic prepared by her husband on August
28 last year.
Ambulance driver James Rudyj gave evidence that he was called to the
Agutter home just after 7pm on August 28 to deal with a case of
suspected poisoning.
He said that Dr Agutter had informed him that he had bought a bottle
of tonic water from Safeway at Swanston the previous Wednesday and had
noticed that the seal of the bottle had been broken.
Mr Rudyj took the almost full bottle and asked Dr Agutter if there was
any more of the tonic and he replied that there was some of his wife's
drink left.
At the ambulanceman's request Dr Agutter put the remainder of the
drink in a separate container, explaining that he would have to take it
with him for analysis.
Throughout, Dr Agutter had been calm and confident ''except when I
told him I would be taking the tonic water to hospital in the
container''.
The trial continues.

GRAMPIAN Regional Council's convener, Councillor Gordon McDonald, is
hoping that his suspension from his job as a VAT inspector will end
within the next fortnight.
Councillor McDonald was suspended on full pay last August to allow
senior Customs and Excise officials to carry out an investigation into
allegations of financial irregularities by him during the course of his
work.
The allegations were made in a letter sent to Customs and Excise
which purported to come from a member of staff at Grampian region.
However, no-one bearing the name with which the letter was signed has
been traced.
Yesterday a Customs spokesman confirmed: ''The situation has not yet
been resolved. It has taken a very long time, but it appears to be a
matter of priorities.
''Mr McDonald is still suspended, but we are not paying him at the
moment because he is on six months' unpaid leave to allow him to be
convener of the region.''
The suspension came to light shortly before Mr McDonald, the SNP
leader on the council, took over the convenership in November, under a
power-sharing agreement with the Liberal Democrats. The convenership
will alternate every six months.
Mr McDonald said that it had been a great strain to have the
allegations hanging over him for so long, and he hoped the matter would
be resolved within the next week or two.
He is understood to be optimistic about the outcome. ''It has been a
strain and the delay hasn't helped me, but I know how the Civil Service
works.
''The Civil Service takes its own time. I have been with them for 28
years, so I am well aware of that.
''We have had a number of discussions and exchanges of letters, but
there have been difficulties in arranging meetings on both sides.
''The trade union which is assisting me in this also has the matter of
4000 redundancies to cope with.''

RICHARD BALMFORTH
Moscow, Wednesday
A MISSILE fired by Norway today as part of a scientific research
programme triggered an air defence alert in Russia, although the rocket
came down more than 620 miles from the Russian mainland.
''We have to agree with the Norwegian side that it was nothing but a
misunderstanding,'' Yuri Fokin, the newly-appointed Russian ambassador
to Norway, told Itar-Tass news agency.
He said the media reaction had been ''inadequate'' -- but did not
mention Russia's early warning system.
An initial report by the respected Russian news agency Interfax saying
an incoming ''combat missile'' from northern Europe had been destroyed
over Russia set off alarm bells in the West and on world currency
markets.
Further signs of confusion in the operational command of Russian air
defences grew as officials shied away from questions, saying only that
they had no information.
Then, as Interfax itself began to backtrack on the report, a Norwegian
defence official in Oslo said the projectile had been a missile fired as
part of a routine scientific research programme at a civilian rocket
range on an island off North Norway.
Norwegian Lieutenant-Colonel John Espen Lien of the North Norway
defence command at Bodoe said the missile had been fired from Andoya
island off North Cape and went down as planned in the Spitzbergen
region.
The Spitzbergen archipelago, Norway's northernmost arctic outpost, is
about 650 miles away from the Russian mainland.
The prospects of a sudden Cold War-style East-West crisis, even as
Russia wrestled with the diplomatic fall-out from its Chechnya campaign,
briefly rattled world currency markets.
The initial report propelled the dollar about three quarters of a
pfennig higher against the mark.
The mark is adversely affected by negative news from Russia because
dealers fear that Germany -- Russia's biggest Western trading partner --
will be the first to suffer from any trouble.
A second report by Interfax, from a different source in air defence
command, said that three Russian early warning systems had picked up the
launch of the missile from Norway, but that it had come down outside
Russian territory.
Dag Halvorsen, a senior diplomat at the Norwegian embassy in Moscow,
said there had been several such civilian missile launches under the
same programme and the Russians were familiar with them.
''How the Russian rocket forces got the idea to issue the information
we do not know. We do not have any source of information,'' Halvorsen
said.
He said there had been no formal government-to-government nor
diplomatic exchanges about the incident.
It was not immediately clear if the Norwegian programme required
formal pre-notification to the Russians.
But Fokin told Tass: ''Russia is not going to demand any explanations
concerning the 'missile incident' because no incident actually took
place.''
The readiness of Russia's air defences to respond in times of crisis
has been a sensitive one since 1987 when a young West German pilot flew
from Helsinki to Moscow in a light aeroplane.
Matthias Rust's unimpeded flight, which ended on Moscow's Red Square,
sparked a shake-up in the military in which the then Soviet Defence
Minister Sergei Sokolov was sacked.
Lien said the missile today had been fired from Andoya rocket range, a
civilian Norwegian aerospace centre.
''It went completely according to plan and landed in the Spitzbergen
area,'' he said. ''There was nothing unusual about the launch. All
instruments worked to perfection.''
Fokin confirmed the missile ''caused no damage of any kind'' when it
came down.

A TORY rebellion in the House of Lords is likely over the issue of
benefit payments to students, it was claimed yesterday.
Student leaders have been lobbying peers in an attempt to reinstate
housing and income support during summer vacations in the vote next
Monday.
Mr Stephen Magee, president of the Edinburgh University Students'
Association, said: ''We have got indications from three senior Tory
peers that they will speak in favour of the motion. That is a fairly
significant rebellion and the message to the Tory Party is that this is
no longer a fringe issue.''
Results of a survey of 1450 Edinburgh University students released
yesterday confirm increasing undergraduate poverty. It shows an average
debt of #1522, one-in-seven students considering dropping out due to
financial hardship, and rents in the city rising by 41% over the last
four years.
Mr Magee said there had been a general slide to debt as loans and bank
overdrafts took over from grants but it had accelerated markedly during
the last two years.
Although most students worked during the summer vacations, only 8% had
jobs for the entire period, wages were generally poor, and some could
not work because of their course commitments.
Despite the expansion in higher education, there were strong
indications that the percentage of students from social class one and
two was increasing.
''Higher education is becoming more and more the preserve of those who
can afford it. That is something Britain should be worried about,'' Mr
Magee added.
He said the campaign, led by the older universities like Edinburgh,
Oxford, and London, was intended to illustrate that all students in
higher education, at whichever polytechnic or university, were
suffering.
Ms Catherine Taylor, president of St Andrews University Students'
Association, said this matched the experience of other universities
where around 40% of students had jobs during term time.
This inhibited academic work and also deprived them of
extra-curricular skills which prospective employers valued.
The campaign has the backing of all Scottish churches. The Rev Maxwell
Craig, of Action for Churches Together in Scotland, said students should
have the same access to housing and income support as other members of
society.
''There is a feeling that students may have a difficult time during
term but at least when the long vacation comes round they can earn some
money.
''The truth of the matter is that 40% of Edinburgh students will have
a bigger debt at the end of the summer break than they had at the
beginning. We are putting a ball and chain on our students,'' he said.

<TEXT>
AS many as 250,000 elderly people in residential care do not need to
be there, it was claimed yesterday.
Lack of community-based support has meant pensioners have been drawn
into institutions, a new report says.
The study, commissioned by the charity Counsel and Care, says up to
half of residents do no need to occupy beds on grounds of disability.
Mr Jeff Smith, general manager of Counsel and Care, said: ''The fact
is what has happened is an over-supply of residential care places and,
in contrast, a tight rationing of care at home.''
Over the last decade the numbers of beds in the private residential
sector has trebled to 31.1 places per 1000 people over 65.
This is despite the fact that only about 11 places per 1000 people
over the age of 65 are needed to support severely disabled people,
according to the report.
Mr Smith said: ''Substantial numbers of older people have entered, and
are still entering, residential homes because there are no reliable
community-based alternatives. This group prematurely encounters the
dependency-creating aspects of residential regimes.''
The report, by Professor Alan Walker, professor of social policy at
Sheffield University, calls for a ''substantial expansion'' of home-care
facilities. It adds that it is essential to offer older people the same
chance for independent living as other groups.

A DRUGS dealer who sold cannabis to children as young as 14 was
sentenced to two years and three months in detention yesterday.
David Boyle, 19, of Mansefield Estate, Tain, used the local swing park
and the Queen Mother's Commemorative Rose Garden to meet his customers,
Tain Sheriff Court heard.
Fiscal Henry Westwater told how Boyle was found out by police after
four schoolboys were discovered with cannabis in the town's High Street.
In a bid to silence informers, Boyle went to the playground at a local
school and beat up a pupil, leaving him with a black eye and a bloody
nose. He then terrorised two other boys at a house in the town.
Mr Westwater said: ''He was well known to local youngsters as a
provider of cannabis resin at #5 a time. He was not the only dealer in
town, but what made him stand out were the tender ages of his
customers.''
Defence counsel Ian Sharpe said Boyle, a first offender, thought being
a dealer gave him some sort of local status, and was also a way of
gaining friends. However, he was not a proper commercial dealer and made
no great profit. Police did not find large quantities of drugs on him.
Boyle admitted seven charges of supplying plus assault and breach of
the peace.
Sentencing him to two years three months in detention, Sheriff Donald
Booker Millburn said: ''It is particularly disturbing that children as
young as 14 were involved. You probably do not know what harm you have
done them in later life.''

GIRLS are cleverer than boys, especially in Scotland, according to the
latest issue of Social Trends published today. Over 47% of Scots girls
passed one or more Scottish Certificate of Education Higher in 1991/92
compared to 36.9% of boys.
The overall picture for Britain is the same, if less dramatic, at
27.8% for boys having one or more A level or SCE Higher compared with
31.4% of girls.
The different examination systems mean the statistics are not directly
comparable, but there has been a significant change since 1975/76. In
that year, boys with one or more A level or SCE Higher led the field at
18% compared with 16% of girls. Since 1981/82, the proportion of boys
has never exceeded that of girls and it has occasionally been lower.
Job prospects for Scottish schoolchildren are getting bleaker. The
percentage facing unemployment on leaving school doubled from 6% to 12%
between 1987/88 and 1991/92, the last year for which figures are
available.
The numbers opting for higher education rose from 28% to 37% over the
same period while the numbers going into full-time employment fell from
31% to 27%, and those opting for youth training fell from 28% to 18%.
Scotland is the only country of the United Kingdom currently collecting
this information.
The female takeover of society could be closer than men expect because
the statistics reveal that, according to projected mortality rates, a
boy born in 1996 can expect to live to 74, a girl to 80.
Man as head of the family appears to be heading for extinction, and
the Amazons to be winning.
In 1992, almost one in five mothers with dependent children was on her
own and, while the proportion of divorced mothers has stabilised since
the 1980s, that of never married mothers has more than doubled. More and
more men and women are living alone, the numbers having doubled over the
previous 20 years to around 11% in 1993.
Women over pensionable age remain the largest group living alone --
the group's size has remained stable over the last 25 years at between
10% and 12% of the population -- and the overall change is due to what
is happening to men, particularly those under pensionable age.
Social Trends, published by the Central Statistial office, was set up
25 years ago by Prime Minister Edward Heath to provide a picture of
where Britain was and where it was headed. A kind of ''biography of the
nation'', this Silver Jubilee edition provides comparisons with 1971,
foundation year, wherever possible. Some of the trends identified are:
Health -- Over half of men and two fifths of women were overweight or
obese in 1991/92. Britain has one of the lowest rates in the EU for
reported Aids cases at 2.8 per 1000 of population in 1993. This compares
with Spain, which tops the list at 14.1, followed by France at 9.9. Only
Belgium, Eire, and Greece are lower than the UK.
People are slowly changing to a healthier diet. While breakfast cereal
sales have risen dramatically -- at 4.5 ounces per person a week we eat
nearly three quarters more than in 1971 -- those of packet sugar have
fallen to just over 5oz per person a week, a third of the amount in
1971. Eggs, however, are less popular -- two per person a week, compared
with four in 1971.
Leisure -- Foreign holidays have trebled since 1971 with some 23.5
million holidays abroad being taken in 1993, which makes up 40% of all
holidays. France is the most popular destination, followed by Spain,
with the United States the most popular non-European destination. People
holidaying at home opt for the West Country, Wales, and Scotland.
Scotland's most popular historic property is Edinburgh Castle visited
by one million people in 1993, second only to the Tower of London which
had 2.3 million visitors. Edinburgh Zoo is the fourth most popular, with
500,000 visitors -- top of the list is London Zoo with 900,000.
Transport -- The distance people travelled by rail in 1993 was
virtually the same as in 1971, whereas the use of private cars or taxis
rose by over 80%. Travel by public transport buses or coaches fell by
nearly a third.
Nearly 30 million people were licensed to drive a car in 1991/93,
compared with 10 million in 1975/76, and the number of women drivers
over the same period doubled from 6.1 million to 12.2 million. Only 57%
of Scottish households had the regular use of a car in 1992, the lowest
figure in Britain. The English figure was 70% of households.
Income and Wealth -- The highest earnings are concentrated in the
South-east of England where the average weekly wage in April 1994 was
#415. In Scotland, six out of the nine regions had average earnings of
below #300 a week.
Nurses have enjoyed the largest percentage increase in earnings since
1971 at over 120% in real terms. They were paid #142 a week in 1971,
#316 in 1994, and are the only group to have moved up the table. Medical
practitioners are the highest earners at #746 a week, compared with
solicitors at #569, and secondary teachers at #427. The lowest paid
workers are waiters and waitresses at #157 a week compared with #105 in
1971.

son, Peter Phillips, 16, billed as a ''first ever interview''.
The Palace complained on behalf of the Princess that the interview was
based solely on a few comments Peter gave to a reporter at the Gatcombe
horse trials. The commission said Today ''exaggerated the nature of the
story'' and said the implication that Peter Phillips had given a first

ANOTHER call for changes to the Common Fisheries Policy was made
yesterday, this time by fish merchants.
Their Scottish federation warned: ''There is a pot boiling and unless
action is taken it will boil over, causing irrevocable damage to all
sectors of the industry.''
Mr Robert Milne, executive director of the federation, said: ''The
Common Fisheries Policy is currently not working to the benefit of the
onshore sector.''
Earlier federation directors met the Scottish White Fish Producers'
Association at which the aims of the anti-European Union Save Britain's
Fish Campaign were outlined.
Mr Milne said the next step would be to consult its members for
grassroots feeling on the matter. The federation will also be seeking
the advice of its political representatives.
0 ''It has to be said that the directors feel that the Government has
not looked after our interests adequately in recent times,''
''At the very least we believe that the Common Fisheries Policy must
be subjected to major change. It has not gone unnoticed that the Prime
Minister's office has allegedly said at the weekend that there should be
root and branch changes to the Common Fisheries Policy. Nothing less
will suffice.''he said.

THE Princess Royal yesterday gave schools a new ''three Rs'' to teach,
along with the traditional reading, writing, and arithmetic. They also
had a duty to teach respect and the difference between right and wrong,
she said.
No-one was born with an innate moral sense and schools had a duty to
instil one. The starting point was self respect, without which children
would be unlikely to show respect to others, the Princess added.
She was speaking at a conference in London organised by Crime Concern,
of which she is patron, which heard how teachers were front-line troops
in the fight against drugs.
Teachers also blamed TV for portraying images of violence which could
encourage bullying in the playground.
While not mentioning TV, the Princess referred to ''uncontrolled
sources of information'' which made teachers' work more difficult.
She said: ''We all want children to grow up in a safe environment
where they are free to develop their skills and talents and become
responsible members of society. We want them, as well, to act within an
acceptable moral code.
''Without self respect, it is difficult to extend any kind of respect
for others, but respect for others is essential to be able to live in
society. Schools have a duty to encourage children to have a sense of
self-worth and to give them the chance to learn right from wrong. No-one
is born with the knowledge of what is right or wrong.''

THE Government yesterday banned coaches from the fast lane of
three-lane motorways from the beginning of next year, in a move roundly
condemned by coach companies.
The ban -- for a trial period of at least two years -- will complement
a European Commission directive which will restrict all coaches to a top
speed of 65mph from next year.
Announcing the decision, Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney said: ''I
am concerned about the safety implications of allowing coaches to
continue using the outside lane when they can no longer travel at the
same maximum speed as cars.''
The Department of Transport said the ban had the strong support of
organisations such as the Association of Chief Police Officers, the AA
and the Magistrates' Association.
But the coach industry umbrella group, the Confederation of Passenger
Transport UK, said the ban would mean an increase in coach fares for
passengers as journey times would be longer and more than one driver
might have to be employed.
It said coaches would become bunched up in the middle lane with no
chance of overtaking slow-moving lorries.

THE #4m security firm raid in Dublin was the biggest criminal cash
haul in Irish history.
In 1992, a gun gang held up a bank's cash holding centre in Waterford
and escaped with #2.7m. By bizarre coincidence, Tuesday was the eighth
anniversary of a raid when almost #1.5m was grabbed from a security van
in Dublin. Detectives believe the gang that carried out that raid also
planned Tuesday's incident.
In 1986, the biggest non-cash haul was old masters worth at least #30m
taken from a County Wicklow house.

THE detective leading the hunt for the killer of design student Yvette
Wilson, 27, of West Kilbride, last night praised the public for their
response to appeals for help but called for more information.
Detective Chief Inspector Jeanette Joyce said that the response to an
appeal from Mrs Wilson's mother, Mrs Marguerite Adam, on Tuesday had

She added: ''I would renew my appeal for people who have any
information at all, whether it is about something that happened in or
around West Kilbride railway station or about Yvette's movements between
Thursday and Saturday of last week, to get in touch with the police.''
Mrs Wilson's badly burned body was discovered in a workmen's bothy on
Saturday evening. She was last seen alive when she left Kip Marina at
Inverkip, where she worked as a barmaid, shortly after 3pm last
Thursday.
Work colleagues and fellow students and staff at James Watt College in
Greenock, where she was studying interior design, are being interviewed.

PRINCESS Margaret and Lord Snowdon are to be shown on TV clowning in
sketches in a home movie shot by Peter Sellers as a birthday present for
the Queen.
The never-before-seen clips are part of 15 hours of private footage
shot by Sellers over many years, used as the basis of an Arena
three-part special about the comedy star on BBC2 next month.
The BBC paid #60,000 to feature part of the collection, previewed in
London yesterday. It includes scenes from a 15-minute film shot in 1965
in which the Princess takes part in a prank where Sellers pretends to
impersonate her.
She also joins in a finale line-up singing the Gang Show theme song
I'm Riding Along On The Crest Of A Wave.
The Princess's former husband Lord Snowdon and Sellers dress up as
gangsters in Fedora hats and overcoats for another sketch.
Series producer and director Peter Lydon said: ''Princess Margaret
knows these clips are being used.''
But he added that Buckingham Palace had not been approached for
permission.
The Arena portrait, which runs for three weeks from February 11, aims
to provide insight into Sellers's enigmatic personality.
The home movie buff, an international star with the Pink Panther
films, died in 1980, aged 55.
Others featured in his personal film collection include his co-star in
The Millionairess Sophia Loren -- whom he sang with on the hit record
Goodness Gracious Me and reportedly wanted to marry -- Orson Welles and
Goon colleagues Spike Milligan and Sir Harry Secombe.
His first wife Anne Levy and their children Michael and Sarah also
contribute. However, they declined to comment on the series yesterday,
having been signed up by a Sunday newspaper.
The star's second wife Britt Ekland refused to take part in the
documentary. She did not want her clips to be used and claimed it was an
invasion of privacy.
Lydon said: ''I was disappointed. She was with him at a critical time
in his life as he moved into being an international star and then his
career went into a slide.''

ONE of Strathclyde's high profile councillors is facing an unexpected
challenge for a seat in the new Glasgow unitary authority.
Mr Charles Gordon, who, as chairman of the region's roads and
transportation committee has been at the centre of the M77 controversy,
may have to contest the Blairdardie ward with an up-and-coming star in
the Labour Party firmament.
Mr Steven Purcell, 22, secretary of the City of Glasgow District
Labour Party, was a surprise nomination given that the district and
regional councillors in the Garscadden Constituency had apparently
sorted out who would fight what ward to avoid unnecesssary
blood-letting.
Mr Gordon refused to comment on the situation other than to say it was
an internal Labour Party matter.
However, sources within the regional council suspect that selection of
candidates for the April elections may be overshadowed by the bitter
feud at the City Chambers between current Labour leader Patrick Lally
and former leader Jean McFadden.
One source said: ''It appears there is a concerted move to have as
many McFadden supporters returned as possible.''
However, a City Chambers source responded: ''Clearly selection
paranoia has set in.''
Meanwhile, it is understood Labour leaders at Strathclyde and Glasgow
are working on a deal to share out power in the new authority.
One possible scenario is committees covering former regional functions
will be chaired by former regional councillors, with district
councillors as vice-chairmen. The reverse would apply to former district
council functions.
Speculation persists that Strathclyde's Labour leader Robert Gould
will lead the new administration at the City Chambers, with the current
district leader Pat Lally assuming the office of Lord Provost.

BRINK'S-ALLIED, the security firm targeted in the Dublin raid, is one
of three companies which specialises in transporting money for banks and
other big cash handling businesses in the Irish Republic.
It was established in Dublin 20 years ago with the backing of local
business interests and partnered by Brink's International, which has
operations worldwide. It is 50% owned by the UK arm, Brink's, itself
owned by American parent company Brink's Inc.
The US company is part of the Pitston Services Group, a quoted firm
whose business includes armoured cars, air courier work, and home
security.
Security firm Brink's-Mat, which became Brink's in 1990, was the
victim of the world's biggest bullion robbery when #26m was stolen from
high security warehouses at Heathrow 12 years ago.
The raid was launched by a telephone message when a crooked warehouse
guard rang a south London number to announce: ''The fishing trip is
on.''
It is thought to be the longest continuous robbery investigation by
British police. As many as 12 trials have been held but many of the
raiders are believed to be still at large.

<HEADLINE>Justice Minister faces questions in the Irish parliament after the country's biggest-ever robbery Police suspect 'Mr Clean' was behind record smash and grab</HEADLINE>

AN underworld figure known as ''Mr Clean'' was the main suspect last
night after Ireland's biggest armed raid, in which a gang -- wielding
handguns and rifles -- stole #3m in only 10 minutes.
Amid claims that police knew in advance that a major crime was
planned, the Republic's newly appointed Justice Minister Nora Owen
pledged all necessary resources to fight crime.
The five-strong gang used a four-wheel-drive vehicle to smash down two
security fences at the Brink's-Allied headquarters in the north Dublin
suburb of Santry on Tuesday night.
In the raid, which police said was planned with ''military
precision'', the gang broke through an internal door and loaded up with
more than 70 red money sacks, each containing #50,000 in used cash
collected from banks all over Ireland. They then escaped across fields.
Shots were fired in the incident as staff tried to fight off the
raiders, but no-one was hurt.
Police suspicion has focused on ''Mr Clean'', a notorious Dublin
criminal, nicknamed because of his supposed abstemious habits -- he is a
non-smoker and non-drinker who likes keeping fit -- and his ability to
avoid prosecution.
A married man in his 30s with a young family, he lives in Dublin's
inner city and is considered to be as a meticulous crime planner with a
flair for detail.
He follows in the path of Martin Cahill, the so-called General of the
Dublin underworld, who was shot dead by the IRA ahead of the ceasefire
last year.
A widespread search for the gang continued throughout the greater
Dublin area last night. One man was being questioned by detectives after
they had raided a number of locations.
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Owen moved swiftly in response to
parliamentary questions to stress that there was no suggestion of
terrorist involvement in the robbery.
Dealing with her first serious incident since being appointed to the
Justice Ministry by Premier John Bruton a month ago, she told MPs that
the security company would have to look at its responsibility following
the raid.
She added that the system for police dealings with companies handling
large amounts of cash would also be fully reviewed.
Her assurance came after confirmation that troops escorting the
security van carrying the money had followed strict security procedures,
leaving the scene minutes before the raid.
The gang breached two fences and constructed a makeshift bridge en
route as they moved in.
''I am satisfied this will be investigated, but cannot give any
indication about what might happen,'' said Mrs Owen.
In the Dail Progressive Democrat leader Mary Harney claimed that
police were aware that a big crime was in the offing.
But Mrs Owen told the house that police regularly received information
about crimes. However, in many cases it was vague and generalised, which
did not enable ''effective and specific counter measures to be taken''.
Mrs Owen declared: ''I am satisfied this was not a situation in which
the information was such that it would have been reasonable to expect
that an effective preventative strategy could have been mounted.
''I am assured that there is no truth in the suggestion that the
police knew a raid on these premises was planned. Had they known this,
they would clearly have been able to prevent it. Neither were the
premises under surveillance.''
She added: ''I deplore this appalling crime.
''We are concerned to ensure that the Garda Siochana (Irish State
Police) will have sufficient resources to fight armed robbery. If
further resources are required, they will be provided.''

THE FUTURE of Barrhead Sanitaryware was thrown into grave doubt last
night after the Baxi Partnership lost its battle to take over the ailing
company at an extraordinary general meeting in Renfrew.
The workers' co-operative was created in a new location in Hillington
after Shanks closed its sanitaryware works in Barrhead.
However, it has been struggling since production started. It lost
#267,000 in the year to last October and, according to the directors,
continues to be cash negative. Baxi, which injected #450,000 into the
company last year, had seen a complete takeover as the only solution.
In advance of the crucial EGM, Ordinary shareholders, in effect the
workers, had agreed to accept Baxi's offer of 40p for their #1 shares
while preference shareholders had agreed to #1 per #1 share. Both
decisions were unanimous.
However, last night only 53% of non-voting Ordinary shareholders
agreed to the deal. Under the complex rules of the co-operative, a
minimum of 75% in all three share categories had to be reached for any
change of ownership to go ahead.
Mr Ray Peedle, chief executive of Barrhead Sanitaryware, said the
decision by the non-voting Ordinary shareholders had come as a great
disappointment.
He said: ''We have to consult very quickly with Baxi, with our funders
and the bank. We will be doing this as a matter of urgency given the
serious financial position of the company.
''There is a great sense of disappointment that we have once again
failed on the non-voting share issue. This is the third time a takeover
bid for the company has failed on this issue.
''The shareholders have been unfairly confused by the false
information that has gone out.''
Mr Peedle's disappointment was shared by Mr Bryan Gray, chief
executive of the Baxi Partnership. His dismay was particularly acute, he
said, because they had had the unanimous support of the employees of
Barrhead Sanitaryware.
He added: ''The conflicting stories and inaccurate representation of
the Baxi offer has contributed to our position tonight.
''We now need to consider our position but there will not be a raised
offer.''
Most of the 500 or so non-voting shareholders are local small
investors who backed the company with some of their savings. They had
been urged by Sir Albert McQuarrie, a former Barrhead chairman, to
reject the offer and to hold out for #1 at least.
