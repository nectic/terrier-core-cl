INFLATION continued to edge higher into the upper half of the
Government's target range last month, while retail sales showed
tentative signs of recovery after a couple months when they drifted
lower.
There were no shocks in the figures which were broadly in line with
City expectations, but detailed analysis of the inflation data threw up
specific causes of concern.
The short-term outlook is for a gradual escalation in the inflation
rate and a further bounce-back in High Street sales as the distorting
impact of the National Lottery fades.
There was nothing in the data to disturb the growing conviction in the
City that interest rates are on hold until the autumn at least,
especially as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, seems to
be targeting the 1% to 4% range as well as its 2.5% mid-point.
Financial markets responded favourably to the Mansion House speeches
with the FTSE-100 share index advancing 30.6 points to 3370.4.
Sterling's trade weighted index edged lower to 84.5 from 84.7 as the
dollar gained on G-7 considerations. The pound lost 1.32 cents on the
dollar to 1.5958, while being unchanged at DM2.2534.
The retail price index rose by 0.4% to 149.6 in May, and the annual
rate of headline inflation increased from 3.3% in April to 3.4%. The
same trend was seen in the targeted RPIX rate (excluding mortgage
interest payments) which advanced from 2.6% to 2.7%. The new RPIY rate,
which excludes indirect and local authority taxes as well as mortgage
interest, moved from 2.1% to 2.2%.
James Capel's Adam Cole was particularly concerned by the
deterioration in the three-month on three-month RPIY rate which edged up
from 2.8% to 2.9% and ''remains well above the annual rate of RPIY
inflation suggesting a further acceleration over the coming months.''
A 1.3% jump in non-seasonal food prices, the biggest monthly increase
since January 1982, has resulted in an escalation in the annual rate of
food price inflation from 3% to 3.7%. This is a worrying development as
it suggests that retailers are easing up on discounting strategies
designed to gain volume.
The other big monthly increase came in household goods where prices
rose by 1.1%, the largest jump for any May for four years, despite the
fact that sales fell sharply.
Overall the volume of retail sales increased by 0.2% in May, and the
previously stated figures for March and April were each revised up by
0.1%.
As a result, sales were 0.2% higher in the latest three months than in
the previous three. Sales were 1.3% higher than in the same three months
a year ago, and the year-on-year growth rate edged up from 1% in April
to 1.1%.
The culprit for the lack-lustre trade in the High Streets is the
National Lottery, which is taking in the equivalent of 3.7% of monthly
sales but is not included in the official figures.
The main victims are the other non-food retailers, covering smaller
traders selling discretionary low-ticket items, whose sales have fallen
by 0.5% in the latest three months and 3.7% on the same three months a
year ago.
Household goods sales plunged by 1.2% in May reflecting the sorry
state of the housing market. Between the latest two three-monthly
periods household goods sales have dropped 1.7% and are 0.6% lower than
in the same three months of last year.
By contrast food retailers and clothing and footwear shopes are doing
well. Food sales increased by 1% in the latest three months (despite
price increases) and were 3.2% higher than in the same three months last
year. Comparable figures for clothing and footwear were 1.5% and 4%
respectively.
Mixed retail businesses turned in a lack-lustre performance with sales
0.2% higher in the latest three months and 2.2% up on the same three
months a year ago.
The Retail Consortium confirmed that small retailers were reporting
continued difficulties in achieving increases in sales.
The consortium's director-general, James May, expressed relief that
the Chancellor had resisted the pressure to increase rates.
''Although retail sales continue to increase against last year,
consumer attitudes to spending remain very cautious and retailing
continues to be adversely affected by the stubbornly flat housing
market,'' he said.

Cape Town
ENGLAND have named an unchanged side for their Rugby World Cup
semi-final clash with New Zealand on Sunday while the All Blacks, too,
are able to field what the Kiwi high command will reckon is as near as
possible to their optimum line-up.
The New Zealanders bring Glen Osborne back into the side at full back
for the game at Newlands Stadium, Cape Town, the North Harbour player
having been unavailable for the 48-30 quarter-final victory over
Scotland due to injury.
Restored from injury, too, is first-choice prop Craig Dowd, who comes
in for veteran Canterbury front-row man Richard Loe.
Mike Brewer, the No.8, who was a late injury call-off for last
weekend's game against Scotland, is restored to rude health and Jamie
Joseph, who stood in to good effect against the Scots is on the bench
but bracketed with Blair Larsen who is also recovering from injury.
Jeff Wilson, the young Otago winger, reappears on the right flank at
the expense of Marc Ellis, the experiment of playing him at full back --
born of necessity due to Osborne's injury problems -- not having proved
to be a whole-hearted success against Scotland.
England are in the fortunate position of being able to field the same
settled side which has seen them through the Grand Slam campaign.
It is no secret that the telescopic array of lineout jumpers who the
English are able to call upon -- Johnson and Bayfield standing at 6ft
7in and 6ft 10in respectively -- plus the power and height of the back
row, is a matter of no little concern to the All Blacks.
Campaign manager Brian Lochore conceded as much yesterday when he
said: ''Yes, that may be a problem for us but I can assure you that it
is receiving our undivided attention.''
England -- M Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), T Carling
(Harlequins), J Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); R Andrew
(Wasps), D Morris (Orrell); J Leonard, B Moore (both Harlequins), V
Ubogu (Bath), M Johnson (Leicester), M Bayfield (Northampton), T Rodber
(Northampton), D Richards (Leicester), B Clarke (Bath).
Replacements -- J Callard (Bath), P de Glanville (Bath), K Bracken
(Bristol), S Ojomoh, G Dawe (both Bath), G Rowntree (Leicester).
New Zealand -- G Osborne (North Harbour); J Wilson (Otago), F Bunce, W
Little (both North Harbour), J Lomu (Counties); A Mehrtens, G Bachop
(both Canterbury); C Dowd, S Fitzpatrick, O Brown (all Auckland), I
Jones (North Harbour), R Brooke (Auckland), M Brewer (Canterbury), Z
Brooke (Auckland), J Kronfeld (Otago).
Replacements -- M Ellis (Otago), S Culhane (Southland), A Strachan
(North Harbour), J Joseph (Otago), B Larsen (North Harbour), R Loe
(Canterbury), N Hewitt (Southland).

JUST when I thought it was safe to go back in the water . . . I've
started scrutinising the bottom of the bath again.
Until the three fatal attacks at the bathing beaches of Hong Kong I
believed I was getting braver about sharks. Two things were responsible
for the new stiffness in my backbone when swimming out of my depth: I
survived the experience of snorkelling off the island of Komodo, an
Indonesian stepping-stone between the selachian habitats of the Indian
Ocean and South China Sea, and I read somewhere that the global
population of sharks accounts for only three human casualties a year.
An ignoble response, I know, but when the shark got its third victim
at Clearwater Bay on Monday I thought, that's it; the rest of us can
relax until 1996. But it seems I've been misled by an innumerate
statistician. The annual toll is around 30 a year, according to all the
shark experts consulted by the press; and this figure is also cited by
Rob Ryan, author of a prescriptive new guide called Stay Healthy Abroad
(HEA Publishing, #7.99).
In his passage on ''sea hazards'' Mr Ryan offers reassurances of the
kind I've been meticulously filing since I first started swimming in
exotic waters . . . ''only 100 attacks in total reported annually . . .
even in Australia, which most of us regard as a Swim-Thru snack bar for
the Great White, there are only two deaths a year . . . only 10 of the
350 species of shark are recognised as likely to attack humans.'' Even
so, he cautions divers to take local advice on the local species.
There's a problem with local advice. As Peter Benchley's novel
skilfully showed (I thought I might manage to avoid mentioning Jaws, but
it can't be done) it isn't always disinterested. I trusted the fishermen
of Komodo who told us the sharks were ''harmless'' because there is no
tourist industry on the island, and the few tourists who find their way
there are more interested in giant monitor lizards than water sports.
Can you place the same trust in the hoteliers of Bali or Goa? A few
years ago, when Mauritius began to attract the attention of long-haul
tour operators, I spent a week on the island on a press trip. Water
sports are big on Mauritius as the entire island is circled by a coral
reef. I asked my usual question, and got the usual tolerant laugh. ''No,
no, we've got the reef. Sharks never come inside the reef.''
As it happens, I've always been a bit suspicious of the safe
reputation of lagoons. There are breaks in every coral cordon sanitaire;
boats go in and out; small and large fish negotiate the throughways; yet
we are asked to believe that a reef shark or Mako in hot pursuit of a
fat grouper screeches to a halt when it reaches the reef and spots the
lagoon. Ooops! Out of bounds! But I made the most of Mauritius. I went
deep-sea fishing in the Indian Ocean and caught nothing, but saw 7ft of
shark slung from the weighing hook when we got back to harbour; and when
I swam and snorkelled and water-skied in the lagoon I was not exactly
nervous but hyper-alert.
On our last day there was an interesting photograph on the front page
of the local paper: a Great White shark, a miniature submarine with
teeth, posed in rigor mortis between the local fishermen who had hooked,
gaffed, and landed it. In the lagoon.
There are lies, fisherman's lies, and statistics, but there is no
antidote to the creative fever of the phobic swimmer. Other creatures
eat us alive -- crocodiles, man-eating tigers, piranha fish -- and many
more enjoy our blood, but the shark is Gothic beyond the facts and
fictions of vampire bats. In our sunniest moments, splashing and
laughing, returned to childhood by the restorative power of our earliest
plaything, the shark patrols the edge of our imagination.
''To be attacked off a British beach,'' says one shark expert, ''would
be rarer than winning the National Lottery.'' Well, that's comforting.
I'd better stop playing the lottery in case I win. However expert the
shark experts there are huge gaps in their knowledge of shark behaviour
and distribution.
The Great White shark is essentially solitary, but every year the same
group of Great Whites surface around the Farallon Islands, west of San
Francisco, and spend the summer hunting seal. I know this because I
watched a televison programme about them, as I watch all new programmes
about sharks in the hope that I'll hear that the most aggressive species
are never found in the Mediterranean. (So far I haven't been given this
information, but perhaps it's taken as read. Once, however, I saw some
pilot whales bouncing through the Straits of Gibraltar, as if en route
to their summer holidays, and I thought, hmmm . . . if there are whales,
why not hammerheads?)
The marine biologists of the Farallan Islands tag these 20-foot
behemoths from skimpy boats and lure them to the surface with floats
which mimic the silhouette of seals. The floats, I noticed, also look
like surf boards or even swimmers idling on the ocean's couch, and the
sharks slice through them like cheese-cutters.
Is it helpful to learn that most shark attacks are ''errors'' -- that
the fish doesn't fancy us at all but mistakes us for its natural prey?
''In murky water particularly,'' says one expert of the Hong Kong
attacks, ''a slow-moving swimmer might be mistaken for a wounded fish''.
On the Farallons the scientists have got quite fond of their tourist
sharks and look forward to the return visits. ''But,'' said one, ''we
have absolutely no idea where they spend the rest of the year.'' He
didn't mean to sound chilling, but a shiver crossed my shoulders.
There is this about sharks: you can Disneyfy snakes and rats and
spiders and crocs but you can't turn the rictus of the shark into a cute
smile. The manufacturers of beach inflatables have tried, but in the
azure swimming pools the cold eye and ghastly grin are sick jokes.
It's the shark's misfortune to look evil; and whatever their nature,
many will suffer for the blunders of their rogue cousin in Clearwater
Bay.

SWITCH on the telly any rainy Cape Town day and you will see members
of the South African team acting their collective parts in various
adverts extolling the virtues of this product or the next. And, it has
to be said, they do it well.
Perhaps Chester Williams stars in more roles than the rest, but the
advert that takes the proverbial biscuit is one where Francois Pienaar,
our local hero and captain, is sitting opposite a very attractive woman
in a bar who is faking the very same thing that was being faked in the
film ''When Harry met Sally'.
Pienaar's facial expressions are wonderful, and, being a beer advert,
the punchline comes when an older lady looks wistfully at the happy
couple and asks the barman for ''a pint of what she's drinking.'' Mary
Whitehouse would never allow it.
It's maybe hard to explain to you just how famous the likes of
Williams and Pienaar are here in South Africa, but they are major
celebrities in a nation that feels it is coming of age after so much
isolation.
Through to the semi-finals and the Springbok team has the nation all
aquiver, and the pressure on Pienaar and his men to perform and win the
cup is staggering.
''There are difficult sides to it,'' admits Pienaar as he prepares his
men for the vital clash with the French in Durban this weekend. ''On the
one hand the support for the team from each of the stadiums has been
very good, and I feel that the country is really uniting behind us, and
that is all colours. But I also think that our supporters expect us to
win the competition, so we are stressing that we see this French match
as our major task before anything else.''
Preparation, then, has been extremely detailed with the reserve Boks
playing a role in training. ''We have had all of our reserves doing the
kind of moves against us that we have picked up from watching the French
on television,'' says Pienaar. ''We made changes to the pack to
counteract the French and the way they play after observing their
pattern. The game coming up is the biggest day in the history of South
African rugby.''
This World Cup has been very good for rugby, it has been very good for
South Africa, and I suspect that it has been very good for Pienaar too,
another of South Africa's rugby ''self-employed.''
Ordinary men and women in the streets want to know what we foreigners
think of the tournament, their country, their chances, and Pienaar.
South Africans don't yet have the jaded cynicism of a nation burdened by
tourism. We foreigners are a novelty.
The public have been learning from us, if that is possible, and so has
the rugby team. ''What we have found of most benefit is watching and
playing against all of the different styles all gathered together in
South Africa,'' says Pienaar. ''We said at the start that we didn't
think of ourselves as in the top flight, and we have worked very hard to
get there in the last few months.''
Nobody in the tournament has been as secretive -- shy is possibly a
better word -- as the South Africans, who have done their utmost to
build an underdog ethos in their own support that meant that the win
over Western Samoa, for example, was treated as a national celebration.
They would hate to be over-confident.
Whatever, the impact of this tournament on a fledgling country is not
to be underestimated. ''We are a rugby mad country,'' says Pienaar,
''but we have never seen anything like this before, and some of us have
been overwhelmed.''
Yes, overwhelmed, and unlike the girl across the table from him in the
advert, I don't think South Africa's amiable captain is faking it
either.

<HEADLINE>As English suppliers feel the pain . . . Scottish dairy trade is in good health</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish dairy trade is in a much stronger position than its
counterpart in England and Wales where this week two of the majors,
Unigate and Northern Foods, have reported substantial profit falls and
plans for considerable staff redundancies.
Speaking yesterday, Lord Sanderson of Bowden, the chairman of Scottish
Pride, said: ''Scottish Pride is very different from the English
situation. We took the pain a long time ago as we moved away from
doorstep deliveries to selling to supermarkets.
Similarly Alan Wiseman, the chairman of Robert Wiseman (Dairies)
Limited which recently reported a 46% increase in profits to #7.02m,
commented: ''We are six or seven years ahead of England in that our
reliance on doorstep deliveries is no more than 16% and still declining
to settle at, I believe, 11%.
''I just do not understand those in England who say that they can hold
the figure at 25% -- that will be difficult and perhaps unrealistic.''
The bulk of Scottish milk is sold to the large supermarket chains, who
by virtue of their sheer strength, exercise enormous bargaining power.
It is a factor which Lord Sanderson is well aware of. ''We have to get a
reasonable price from the supermarkets, firstly to give our suppliers a
decent return but also and very importantly so that we continue with our
investment programme.''
It is an open secret that the new management team which took over
Scottish Pride when it was hived off from the old Scottish Milk
Marketing Board found problems which they had not expected and were then
forced to make some crucial and hard business decisions, including
closing the Galloway Cheese plant in Stranraer.
However, considerable progress is being made, said Lord Sanderson.
''We are getting there and have made huge strides in the last few
months. We've invested over #2m in the bottling plant at Govan and that
is by no means the end of our plans.''
Interestingly the plastic bottles which are filled with milk at the
Govan plant are made on the same premises by the Bowater Group who have
also invested #2m, making it, said Lord Sanderson. ''An interesting
joint venture.''
Alan Wiseman, whose company profits came from sales of just over #100m
in comparison to the #16.4m profits of Northern Foods from sales of
close on #2000m, believes that the supermarket can provide decent
margins for the trade. He said: ''It's all about service and giving the
customer what they want. If you do that the margins are acceptable.''
Mr Wiseman is also confident that prices to dairy farmers for their
milk will remain good. ''I don't see much movement because there is not
really enough milk around and I think the outlook is good for the
foreseeable future.''
He also discounts the notion that a large number of farmers are set to
end their contracts with Scottish Milk and sign up with his company or
one of the other rivals.
He said: ''That is just nonsense. There is very little sign of anyone
wanting to move anywhere. It's true that one or two may have given
notice to Scottish Milk but they have to do that 12 months in advance
and then they can withdraw it if they want. It seems quite sensible to
me to give room for manoeuvre.''

ECONOMIC recovery in Scotland varies upon region with the Aberdeen
area seeing a quite healthy gain whereas that around both Edinburgh and
Glasgow is at best slow and steady.
Business consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand's latest regional trends survey
says that although there seems to be increasing signs of optimism, the
potential increase in demand is unlikely to be matched by a rise in the
number of new jobs.
The senior Scottish partner Frank Blin added that there is not a lot
of evidence of growth in consumer spending, particularly from the retail
sector and there is still some difficulty in passing on supplier price
increases.
Scotland is not seeing serious capacity constraints but there are
skill shortages in manufacturing.
There are no signs of increased investment partly due to concern over
interest rates and the engine for growth remains inward investment in
the technology and oil sectors and the resultant exports.
The West Midlands and Yorkshire are the only two other areas to show
improvement.
Cooper's head of economics, Rosemary Radcliffe, warned that the
overall rate of UK GDP growth is beginning to slow.
There is low confidence and the fragile recovery is export led.
''There is no golden age ahead,'' she said.
Investment is a lower proportion of GDP than that of major competitors
at just 16% while the cost of capital is higher because of the greater
weighting of reward demanding equity to debt than in Europe and higher
long-term interest rates.
FORMER Sidlaw executive Tom
Cardale has won the backing of CINVen,
the venture capital fund for the development
of his company Consolidated Supply Management
(CSM), which is based in Aberdeen.

THE UK'S largest independent petrol retailer, Frost Group, has
extended its operations into Scotland for the first time with the
purchase for #83m of Burmah Castrol's UK petrol retailing and
wholesaling business.
Overall, the deal adds 182 company-owned petrol stations to the Frost
operation together with supply contracts to 807 dealer-owned sites. It
means a greater presence in South-east England as well as a substantial
hold in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is the first time that Frost
has become involved in Ulster.
There are around 20 company-owned sites in Scotland and another 100 or
so privately run with supply contracts which will come under the Frost
orbit.
The enlarged group will own around 6% of UK-company owned sites and
account for more than 4.5% of UK petrol sales. Frost is financing the
deal through a one-for three cash-call to shareholders at 213p a share
to raise #46.7m net of expenses. This compares with yesterday's price of
270p, up 5p. The rest of the purchase price will come from banking
facilities, including a new #55m five-year revolving credit.
Commenting on the acquisition and rights issue, chairman and chief
executive James Frost described it as ''a rare opportunity for Frost to
make a leap in its development on a basis which should enhance earnings
per share for the medium term.''
The Burmah business made a profit of #8m before tax in 1994 on
turnover of #544m. At Burmah's AGM on May 19, it was reported that
trading in the Fuels Division continued to be difficult in several of
its markets and notably in the UK.
Burmah will use the money raised from the sale to reduce its net
borrowings. Jonathan Fry, Burmah Castrol's chief executive, said: ''The
UK fuels market has been undergoing major structural changes, with
competition intensifying as the supermarkets increase market share, and
the capital requirements of new service stations rising sharply.
''Against this background, it has become increasingly clear that our
UK fuels business could not improve profitability significantly without
substantial investment in the expansion of its network. This would have
run counter to our strategy of focusing investment on Castrol and
chemicals.''
The sale to Frost, which will include the operation in its own Save
network, was regarded by Burmah Castrol as being in the best interest of
its shareholders. Burmah shares firmed 4p to 935p.
For its part, the board of Frost considers that the long-term trends
in the UK petrol retailing market will continue for another five years.
This means there will be a reduction in the number of sites with those
that remain selling higher volumes of petrol and there will also be a
increasing proportion of company-owned to dealer-owned facilities.
The optimim size for the group's UK business is, therefore, expected
to be around 500 company-owned filling stations (currently there are 438
including Burmah) with a similar number of sites supplied on a wholesale
basis.
After realising the potential of the Burmah business, Frost said it
will be looking to extend its petrol marketing activities into new
areas. In particular, it intends to examine the opportunities for
developing a petrol retailing operation in northern Europe.

HAMPDEN was placed on the short leet for a massive cash hand-out from
the Millennium Commission yesterday, and Queen's Park committee member
Austin Reilly defended the concept of an independent national stadium
for Scotland.
Earlier this week, the hugely expensive building plans for Hampden
came under fire again, this time from recent tenant Celtic, whose
managing director Fergus McCann questioned the need for money being
spent on upgrading Hampden, when the city would soon have a new stadium
at Parkhead and already boasts first-class facilities at Ibrox.
Reilly backed off from a row with Celtic, but he did stress: ''Other
countries are going down the same road as we are. France are building a
national stadium and the Low Countries are also examining proposals
which would provide them with an independent national stadium.
''It is my understanding -- and that of the SFA -- that having such a
stadium would enhance the country's chances of staging the European
Championship finals at some stage in the future. That is one of our
aims.
''I cannot see any merit in an argument against the idea of a truly
national stadium for a country which helped give the game to the
world.''
Back, though, to the Millennium cash and it will now be September
before a final decision is reached. That money, if it appears, would be
used to enhance certain aspects of the stadium itself, particularly in
regard to safety and security. It would also help create a football
museum and an indoor arena, which would have community benefits as well
as possible use for minor sports.
As for Hampden itself, the current redevelopment will continue with
the rebuilding of the South Stand.
Says Reilly: ''Nothing will stop the new Hampden appearing. Whenever
the last of the European qualifying games is played work will begin. We
will eventually have a stadium with a 5-star listing from UEFA and FIFA,
which will make it a possible venue for European Cup finals. And then we
could look towards staging the European Championhips.''

FINE weather over the past two days proved a mixed blessing for the
organisers of the ScotGrass 95 event staged at Woodend Farm, Armadale,
West Lothian, as a joint venture by the Agricultural Engineers'
Association and the Scottish Agricultural College.
Ideal conditions for grasscutting at Woodend meant that many potential
visitors were busy at home getting on with their own silage rather than
taking a day out to see machinery demonstrations.
Visitor numbers on Wednesday topped the 1000 mark and it was expected
that that figure would be more than doubled by the time the gates were
closed on the two-day event last night.
While numbers may have been somewhat less than expected there was
confidence that those who did come along could be regarded by the
exhibitors as serious potential customers.
Host farmer Roy McNee had 100 acres of grass available as demonstation
areas for the machinery manufacturers and suppliers. Twenty-three
companies put a whole range of equipment through its paces including
mowers, self-propelled forage harvesters, balers, bale wrappers and
specialist clamp-loading gear.
Joint co-ordinator Chris Evans, of the Agricultural Engineers
Association, said that there was every prospect of the event being
repeated in three years time.

Whatever you are, sparkle at it. That's the credo of trans-sexual
singer Jayne County, set to rock the Cathouse in Glasgow.
JAYNE County is not as other males are, as her self-chosen first name
might indicate. For one thing, she wears dresses and make-up, and is
never happier than when displaying her hormone-induced cleavage. But
there's rather more to Jayne than meets the eye.
For although she remains Wayne County below the waist, in Jayne's head
and heart she's been completely unmanned for most of her 48 years. Or as
the title of her newly-published autobiography puts it with trademark
forcefulness, Jayne County is Man Enough To Be A Woman.
Jayne County, you see, is a trans-sexual punk'n'roll sister-boy
from the American Deep South. She first attained a certain underground
notoriety in New York in the sixties, when she hung out with Andy
Warhol's glamorous grotesquerie of drag queens. Boys who'd changed from
a he to a she by shaving their legs, re-inventing themselves under names
like Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn, and living by the sequinned credo
of camp: It doesn't matter what you are as long as you look utterly
fabulous.
In the mid-seventies, Jayne formed part of David Bowie's circus of
glam decadence, discovering a bent for performance and signing to
Bowie's management company, Mainman. Moving to London during the
original punk era, she fronted the Electric Chairs and sang pithy,
self-penned ditties with memorable titles like If You Don't Want To F***
Me, Baby, F*** Off.
Since then, Jayne County has lived in Berlin, London, New York;
appeared in cult movies -- Derek Jarman's Jubilee and Rosa von
Praunheim's City of Lost Souls -- and re-issued her musical
back-catalogue on two compilation albums, Let Your Backbone Slip and
Rock'n'Roll Cleopatra, via the RPM label. Bringing things right up to
date, Jayne and her current band will be rocking Glasgow once more next
Thursday at the Cathouse, singing selections from Jayne's new RPM album,
the self-glorying Deviation.
Yet are men-as-women still perceived as being deviant anymore? After
all, we've had more than a decade of mainstream gender-bending -- from
the cosy Boy George to the stunning RuPaul via The Big Breakfast's
cheerily-vulgar Lily Savage, not forgetting last year's summer vogue
among straight chaps for swanning around nightclubs in mini-kilts.
Sheee-oot, but it wasn't that way in redneck Georgia in the sixties.
Indeed, it was only recently, after 20 years away from home, that
Jayne felt able to return and re-establish links with her parents. ''My
father is half-blind now so he couldn't see what I looked like anyway,
and my mother is a right-wing Christian fundamentalist who copes by
thinking of me as conforming to some set of showbiz rules of appearance,
like I was Liberace.
''I mean, I didn't go back home wearing a mini-skirt and push-up bra,
but in the shopping mall I'd get assistants saying: 'Can I help you,
miss?' In the sixties, of course, people like me got chased through the
streets. I couldn't help thinking things had been quite different then.
''I've always adopted the female role, never the male. I had a gay
identity before I had a trans-sexual identity . . . before I became sure
that while I was born one sex, I feel the other. I'm not a man. I'm not
a woman, either. I take the political stand of being a third sex.
''I guess I was given direction by rebelling against the strange Old
Testament cult that my mother joined. They couldn't celebrate birthdays;
the women couldn't wear cosmetics. There was this list of dos and
don'ts, mostly don'ts . . . and with me it's always been do, do, do!
''I'm a left-wing liberal free-thinker. Live your life as your
conscience says you should. Just don't hurt anyone . . . and don't
steal. As a teenager in Atlanta, I remember I stole lipstick and felt
guilty about it. But I like to party and to carry on. To rock'n'roll.''
Ah yes! Hail, hail frock'n'roll! Jayne's new music remains what it
ever was: ''Fast-paced. Punky. With tongue-in-cheek humour. Song titles
like Everyone's An Asshole But Me. Bitchy but funny.''
But what of Jayne's most bitchily-funny rock'n'roll memories, as
available in her book. Woodstock gets dismissed in a page -- hey, how
could a girl be expected to shine in a field of muddied hippies? It
transpires that a lot of names had to be changed, if not dropped
altogether, in order to protect the guilty-but-litigious.
''There are still some juicy titbits in there. David Bowie playfully
grabbing a hold of me at a party and throwing me on the floor. 'Get off!
Get off! Get off!' I shouted. I found him obnoxious sexually.
Knock-knee'd. Too feminine. I've always preferred something chunkier.
''We toured with the Police. That was like being on the road with
librarians. I'd occasionally get a peek at Sting, changing in his
dressingroom. That's me . . . childish. I've never grown up.
''I love giggling. I still can't resist shocking the straightest, most
conservative people . . . hooking up my skirt and doing the can-can in
the middle of a bunch of American tourists.''
Or mincing proud and tall through the middle of urban war-zones.
Jayne's recollection of sashaying through the Palestinian sector of
Jerusalem, in full drag, as hostile Palestinian children began throwing
large rocks: ''I thought it was fab! I phoned my mother and told her I
got stoned, just like people in the Bible.''
Jayne's memory of the celebrated Stonewall riot in New York in 1969
which signalled the start of gay self-assertion: ''At one point we could
see the police lining up along Greenwich Avenue with riot gear and
shields and everything, so we drag queens all put our arms round each
other and started dancing along, singing: 'We are the Pixie Girls, we
wear our hair in curls, we never play with toys, we'd rather play with
boys' to the tune of Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-De-Ay. The police started laughing.''
It's getting harder to shrug off repression with such displays of
sassy sang froid these days, though. ''I hate what's happening in
America. Right-wing Christians who've turned Christianity away from
love, compassion, understanding, and made it into taking money away from
the poor, and denying rights for gay people.
''Dreadful, trouble-making, narrow-minded people like Pat Robertson,
Rush Limbaugh . . . Newt Gingrich. They're scary and they're gaining
power. You should never say: 'This is my opinion, and it's the absolute
truth' -- that's what starts wars.
''I try to do my bit to stop them with my rock'n'roll. Opening up a
few minds.''
Open up minds; open up choices. Under Jayne County's free doctrine,
you can be a man. You can be a woman. And you can be a man-woman, a
woman-man. Whatever you are, sparkle at it. Or would you rather crawl
into the darkness under a stone and be a Newt?

<HEADLINE>Support for cashmere</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>22</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977862798</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE National Farmers' Union of Scotland has added its weight to the
campaign by Scotland's cashmere fibre producers to have cashmere goats
included in the Hill Land Compensatory Allowance and Sheep Annual
Premium support payments.
The union has accepted that cashmere goat production could be a
valuable diversification for Scottish farmers. Without access to
support, however, it would be difficult for many farmers to contemplate
a change-over from sheep to goats.
In a submission to the Scottish Office, NFUS commodity director
Richard Henton has called for support to be provided on cashmere goats
where they replace sheep that are eligible for HLCA and SAP payments.
By insisting that payments are made only on goats that replace
eligible sheep it would be possible to avoid any increase in the overall
cost of the two support schemes, he said. Producers would have the
option of receiving support on either sheep or goats while at the same
time maintaining their overall level of support. Such a change, he said,
would remove the disadvantages currently applying to cashmere goat
production in Scotland.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Cashmere producers Association will be
featuring starter-packs at next week's Royal Highland Show. For about
#500 potential breeders will get a number of selected breeding females
and access to a fibre-tested buck plus management and marketing advice.
SPCA shairman Peter Murray-Usher said: ''We hope to convince more
farmers that cashmere has real potential for the hills and uplands of
Scotland. Expansion is being hindered by the absence of the support
currently enjoyed by sheep. Once we get parity, cashmere fibre
production will undoubtedly expand.''

There's no end to the commercialism around these days. It's sell,
sell,
sell, especially with Father's Day beckoning. Only trouble is, recalls
ANDREW POPPLE, his youngsters never seem to get the message
I AM mortified. And hungry. It appears that no other, um, person in
this house has remembered it's Father's Day, and I hardly feel it's up
to me to go and get my own breakfast in bed. It's not as if there isn't
a precedent.
On Mother's Day our eight-year-old pulled out all the stops. We were
woken to the sound of clinking crockery as this huge trayful of
breakfast goodies made its way up the stairs. Very precariously. I could
visualise all the bits of breakfast taking wing as she tripped at the
top of the stair, then them hitting the landing floor and running back
down the stairs. Followed by distraught daughter.
I am known for my contingency plans, and this occasion was no
exception, despite it being early on a Sunday morning. So there I was,
planning: How to mop up the Bran Flakes and milk. What to do with the
boiled eggs and toast. Whether cafetiere coffee stains come out of the
carpet -- could be an expensive breakfast.
I needn't have worried. It all arrived safely, if rattly. And I had
forgotten in my greed than an eight-year-old's idea of breakfast heaven
is different from ours. The bowl contained Coco Pops, millions of them.
A cup held the compulsory milk; another some orange juice. Then there
was the Fruit Corner (kiwi fruit and gooseberry). A slice of Nutella
toast. And a banana. We don't call her Pit the Bottomless for nothing.
And the sore point: it was all for Mum. For me, only a smile, then a
frown, then an ''oops''. But no worries. Mum is rather fussy about her
breakfast, so I ate it instead. Like daughter, like father.
But today, nothing. They didn't even have the courtesy to sleep in to
the late, late hour of half-seven. Are they telling me something? Am I,
after all, not succeeding at this role-reversed house dad lark? Or is it
simply that a hard-working Mum just didn't get the time to remind them
that it was my turn to have a special day? Or buy a Father's Day card.
Or a box of those chocolates they keep on advertising; after all, they
know I'm a chocoholic. Sniff.
Or, horror of horrors, are they saving it all up to treat me next
Mother's Day?
Perhaps, in these politically correct times, we should go for Primary
Carer's Day and Secondary Carer's Day. An Equal Carer's Day could be
optional and would, I suspect, cause many interesting debates in homes
up and down the land. Along the lines of ''And when, may I ask, did you
last get up to the kids at three in the morning/sort the homework/sew on
the nametags/get their names right/ etc?''
And for those families where the man admits to spending less than five
minutes a day with the children -- whan an admission of failure as a
participating parent that is -- we could have a Seen the Face, Give Me a
Moment, Day.
Meanwhile, I'll get myself a bowl of breakfast sawdust and hope
somebody notices the pout before too long . . .

SOUTHERN Water disappointed the market by not announcing a special
dividend to shareholders, who are left with a normal final payment of
17.45p making a total 12% up at 25.9p for the year to March, writes
CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Chairman William Courtney ruled out special dividends, saying he did
not believe in them. Instead he pointed to the group's progressive
dividend record. Southern is to ask shareholders to approve the possible
buy-back of up to 10% of its equity.
It is hoped to make savings on the #1200m capital spending programme
and these will split equally between customers and shareholders. Further
savings in operating expenses are also planned.
Mr Courtney explained that this will be achieved through a combination
of innovation and enhanced controls and procedures. Customers will be
rewarded with further improvements in service rather than cash payments.
These will include odour control, reduction in foul flooding and reduced
sewer infiltration.
Southern's profits in the year rose 12.5% to #143m. Turnover of the
water business was nearly 6% ahead at #338m and operating efficiencies
of 2% were achieved.
Trading profits of the non-regulated activities rose a tenth to
#11.1m. These range from clinical waste disposal to alarm monitoring. Mr
Courtney said they had made encouraging progress in many areas.

<TEXT>
DEPARTMENT stores group Allders told yesterday of ''challenging''
trading conditions that threaten to send profits into reverse this year.
With expansion in airport duty-free shops, Allders' sales grew by 4%
to #371m in the first half of the financial year.
''Prospects for the remainder of the year are mixed,'' chairman John
Pattisson said.
''In recent weeks our department stores have experienced a
deterioration in consumer demand and there is strong competition,
especially in the heavy household merchandise areas in which we
specialise.
''If this continues through the summer it will be difficult for
Allders department stores to equal the excellent results of last year,''
he said.
In the department stores side, profits fell by #300,000 to #10.1m at
the interim stage after Allders absorbed start-up costs at new stores in
Northampton and Lincoln.
Allders' taxable profits were helped by #3.8m of successful business
rate appeals in the six months to March 31 and rose to #16.5m from
#11.1m.
During the 1994 year, the Allders group made profits of #25.4m.
At the flagship store at Croydon in Surrey modernisation of the
adjacent Whitgift Centre continued to have some adverse effect on
trading, Mr Pattisson said.
''Fortunately this work is now complete and the centre was relaunched
last month. It looks splendid and, combined with our own refurbishment
last year, will undoubtedly enhance prospects at Croydon in the years
ahead.''
On the duty-free side, sales grew by #3.7m to #193.7m with new sites
opened in major European airports.
The interim dividend is 2.4p compared with 2.2p on 18% higher earnings
of 11.3p.

THE benefit of share buy-backs, which are increasingly common by the
utilities, is shown clearly in the latest figures from South Wales
Electricity (Swalec).
The amount allocated to dividends in the year to last March is raised
by 9%, but owing to the lower number of shares in issue, this translates
into a 20% rise in dividends to 30.6p after a final of 19.6p.
The 27% increase in net attributable profits becomes a near-31%
improvement in earnings per share.
Swalec shares shed 9p to 732p, in line with the sector which was
mildly disappointed with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report
on Scottish Hydro which was considered less lenient than hoped.
But Swalec chief executive Andrew Walker indicated yesterday he would
still be prepared to appeal to the MMC should the regulator's
forthcoming review of prices charged by the English electricity
distributors be thought too harsh on the company.
Swalec was already starting to implement cost savings of #25m-#30m as
well as having cut consumer prices by 16%. Mr Walker noted that the
company served a thinly and evenly spread customer base.
''We would be concerned if either the investment or maintenance costs
were going to be excessively reduced because that would impact
dramatically on the level of customer service,'' he said.
Last year's price review will lead to lower profits this year even
before any revisions the regulator may now make. In 1994-95 the volume
of power delivered rose by 1.6%. In the non-distribution activities,
electrical contracting moved from losses of #2.2m to profits of #1.5m.

EURO Disney, whose turbulent share price graph resembles one of its
white-knuckle rides, yesterday proclaimed it was definitely on track to
break-even during its next financial year.
The loss-making theme park group is pinning its hopes on its #82m
Space Mountain rollercoaster ride, launched last month, as well as a 22%
reduction in Disneyland Paris's high-season entrance prices to Ffr195
(#25).
Euro Disney's break-even target, which applies to the year to
end-September 1996, was set at the time of last June's rescue package.
The financial restructuring involved the sale of #700m of new shares
and the postponement of interest payments.
Speaking after yesterday's publication of Euro Disney's semi-annual
report, company spokesman Jacques Henri Eyraud said: ''We are definitely
on track to reach this (break-even) objective.''
Referring to Space Mountain, he added: ''It has been pretty
successful. It is clearly a hit among consumers and the analysis and
comments from our guests are overwhelmingly positive.
''We have to see what effect this ride has on the number of visitors
to our park but we are confident it will have a big impact.''
He also believed the reduction in entrance fees would further boost
attendances at the re-named Disneyland Paris during the second half,
which takes in the peak months of June, July, August and September.
However, in its semi-annual report, Euro Disney said that continued
weak growth in European consumer spending, volatile and high short-term
interest rates, and instability in global currency markets remain
important areas of uncertainty.
Mr Eyraud said: ''We don't see any major impact from a rise in
consumption.''
Euro Disney has taken its shareholders on a rollercoaster ride during
the last five years. The company's shares, which peaked at 737p in March
1992 and bottomed at 78p last October, yesterday lost 4p to 198p.
In April, Euro Disney revealed it had slashed first-half losses from
Ffr1055m (#134m) to Ffr241m (#31m), with the financial restructuring,
improved operating efficiency and higher revenues all contributing.
Boosted by an 11% rise during the second quarter, first-half theme
park and resort revenues were 7% higher than the same period of Euro
Disney's previous financial year at Ffr1678m (#213m).
More effective marketing was cited as one of the reasons for the
increase in attendances and hotel occupancy.
A 9% rise in theme park revenues, to Ffr796m (#101m), was achieved in
spite of lower seasonal prices for local residents and reduced food
prices.
Referring to recent increases in attendances, Mr Eyraud said: ''With
the new prices and with Space Mountain, we think this trend will
continue.''
In spite of the turnaround in its fortunes, Euro Disney's balance
sheet still bears the scars of recent troubles. It has debts of about
Ffr15.5bn (#1967m), compared with shareholder equity of Ffr5300m
(#673m).

WITH the death of his mother causing Linford Christie to withdraw from
the athletics meeting last night in Nuremberg, and defeats for Colin
Jackson and John Regis, Scotland's Melanie Neef was left to uphold the
British flag.
The sport had anticipated Christie's first race following his
declaration of intent to retire this year. Instead, he flew home on
receiving news which clearly also upset Jackson, his friend and business
partner. The world record holder was beaten over 110 metres hurdles for
the first time in 31 starts.
The Welshman clocked 13.43 to finish third behind Florian Schwarthoff
(13.19) and Mike Fenner (13.41). Regis, running in the 100m, recorded
10.45, fifth behind the Canadian, Donovan Bailey (10.05).
''I was with Linford when he took the call,'' said Jackson. ''It was
very sad. When a close friend hears news like that, it's bound to get to
you too.''
Neef received an emotional victory hug from her father, Gerry, the
former Rangers goalkeeper whom last she saw aged seven. Already second
fastest Scot, Neef's 51.70 edged her closer to Linsey Macdonald's
15-year-old Scottish record of 51.16, moving her to equal twelfth with
Verona Elder, the UK team manager, on the British all-time list.
Her victims included Uta Rohlander, one of her likely rivals at the
European Cup final in Lille next weekend. But Craig Winrow was beaten
into sixth (1-48.11) in the 800m by Nico Motchebon (1-45.74) whom he
faces in Lille, and John Mayock was second in the 1500m with 3-40.70.

UNLIKE the other leading supermarket chiefs, Argyll chairman Sir
Alistair Grant has suffered a sharp fall in income as a result of the
Safeway chain's indifferent trading performance in the year to March.
His total remuneration tumbled from #986,000 to #627,000 because of
the absence of any performance-related bonus.
Deputy chairman David Webster did receive an annual incentive award
but his overall pay fell 32% to #482,000, while chief executive Colin
Smith was down 15%.
Sir Alistair was granted no further share options in the year and the
options over 765,000 shares he held at the year-end, at exercise prices
ranging from 196p to 255p, are currently worth some #2.5m, giving him a
net profit of #500,000.
Mr Webster was granted new options over 100,000 shares at an exercise
price of 237p which compares with the current share price of 326p. He
now has 510,000 in aggregate. Mr Smith has 484,000 shares under option.
Argyll underperformed its competitors, achieving only a 2% increase in
profits to #370m before exceptionals. Sir Alistair says in his
chairman's statement that the early weeks of the current year give him
''some encouragement'' and he projects major benefits from the Safeway
2000 programme to improve efficiency.

NICK Price, the Open and US PGA champion, made an impressively
positive start to adding a third major arrow to his quiver when he took
the lead in the first round yesterday on the US Open Golf Championship.
His score over the Shinnecock Hills' exacting 6944-yard test was 66,
four under par, and had he not missed from six feet at the last, the
Zimbabwean would have equalled the course record.
As it was, only nine other players broke par -- evidence indeed that
this layout, in character totally different from any other US Open
course, represents a challenge that is no less difficult, although the
sun shone and the breeze was comparatively light.
As Scott Simpson, winner in 1987 and the loser in a play-off four
years later, moved into second place on 67, and Greg Norman, without
yielding a bogey, joined Phil Mickelson on 68, a remarkable recovery was
contrived by Jose Maria Olazabal. Starting with five bogeys and turning
in 41, he came home in 32 for a 73, a stroke ahead of Severiano
Ballesteros.
Fuzzy Zoeller, a former champion, said and proved: ''You have to play
patiently and put the ball on the fairway and on the correct place on
the greens.'' Price, whose best finish has been fourth in nine
appearances, combined that strategy with striking the ball so well that
he missed targets in regulation only three times.
Price neglected his chance of winning the other major, the Masters, by
missing the cut at Augusta in April, but his last three finishes were
twelfth, tenth, and ninth, and he was ''not surprised that I played
well, just that my score was so low. To beat 70 you have to play your
tail off and this was my best round this year.''
Although he was three times outdriven 50 yards by the US Amateur
champion, Tiger Woods -- the youngest player in the field at 19 who
finished eight strokes behind him -- Price's control through the green
and his approach putting and holing out were such that only two of his
five gains could be thought fortunate -- the 30-foot chip in at the long
fifth and a putt of 30 feet at the seventeenth.
His only bogey, a 5 at the twelfth, seemed more important
psychologically than any of his birdies. ''Any time I need a No.3 wood
for my second shot to a par 4 -- in this case 472 yards -- I regard it
as a par 5.'' He was unaware his missed putt was to match the record.
After a five-hour round, Colin Montgomerie, third and second in his
only three appearances, joined England's Mark Roe and Olle Nordberg,
Sweden, as the leading Europeans on 71 -- a score which was by no means
dispiriting but of which he was inclined to be critical, because
Montgomerie's three bogeys all came at holes he considered opportunities
for birdies.
At the fourth and sixteenth Montgomerie was in two bunkers and at the
eighth, measuring 367 yards, the shortest of the par-4s, his approach
went to the back of the green from where he took three putts.
Montgomerie's two birdies came at the sixth, where he hit a No.4 iron
to 25 feet, and the short seventh, where he hit a No.7 iron to 18ft. All
the way home he set himself up for birdie chances, but his re-adopted
putter could not turn them to his advantage.
The fortunes of one group served to sum up most experiences. Nick
Faldo, Tom Watson, and Fred Couples had eight birdies among them, but 10
bogeys, with Couples' contribution two double bogeys.
Faldo was almost relieved to have ''salvaged'' a 72. ''I hit too many
bad iron shots. I kept getting in my own way, as my left shoulder
repeatedly came up instead of going round.'' As a result, Faldo missed
eight of the first 12 greens in regulation, but his three bogeys all
came after he had safely driven into the fairway.
Ian Woosnam, whose interest in the game has never been at a lower ebb,
was satisfied with 72.
The holder, Ernie Els, was in a group on 74 who included Bernhard
Langer, Payne Stewart, Woods, and David Gilford.

GEORGE Duffield rode a double and received a two-day ban at Hamilton
yesterday.
He won on Just Ice (2-1) and Habeta (11-2), with the latter clinching
his ninth career success. But Duffield was in trouble with the stewards
over his use of the whip.
He was found guilty of improper riding because he had struck his mount
with unreasonable frequency over the last two furlongs. He was suspended
for two days -- June 24 and 26.
The Stonefield Selling Handicap was won by Halbert (16-1), who broke
his duck -- at the twenty-seventh attempt. Halbert is leased by Mike
Channon to the Sun Punters Club and was providing the members with their
first taste of victory.
But the six-year-old ruled himself out of a second intended target, as
he is no longer qualified for the Gullane Maiden Stakes at Edinburgh
tonight.

BRITISH officials were last night expected to rubber-stamp a plan to
save Edinburgh Racers.
A rescue package, thrashed out in four hours of detailed talks with
Murrayfield Ice Rink directors, was being considered by the sport's
governing body. It includes the team dropping from the premier to first
division.
Rocketing costs, and the loss of nearly all Racers' top players,
forced the rink directors to opt for a place in the first division.
The rink's survival plan, which came just hours after Racers'
directors pulled the plug on the team which was runner-up in the British
championship last season, was backed by supporters' association chairman
Tam Smith.
Smith, who spelt out the proposal to more than 100 association members
at their annual meeting last night, said: ''It's the only way forward if
we want British League ice hockey in Edinburgh. There is nothing else
left. It's something to hang on to.''
Rink director Richard Stirling said: ''The ball is in the BIHA's hands
now. We're asking them to allow us to drop down a division and we have
faxed our plan to them.''

NEW Zealand fly half Andrew Mehrtens needs just 12 points in Sunday's
World Cup semi-final against England in Cape Town to set a world record.
The 22-year-old All Black, with 88 points in his first four
internationals, could become the first player to reach 100 points in
only five test matches.
Mehrtens scored 28 points on his debut when the All Blacks beat Canada
73-7 in Auckland in April and has added a further 60 points in his three
appearances at the World Cup.
He scored 18 points against Ireland, 19 against Wales, and 23 in the
quarter-final win over Scotland last weekend.
Mehrtens missed out on the All Blacks' runaway 145-17 win over Japan
in which his replacement, Simon Culhane, scored 45 points, a record for
an individual in a test match.
The record for the fastest centurion is held by former New Zealand fly
half Grant Fox, who reached 100 points in six internationals.
Fox is also the quickest player to reach 200 points (13 matches), 300
points (18 games) and the 400-point mark, in his twenty-sixth
international.

<HEADLINE>ScottishPower could be main beneficiary of MMC report Hydro-Electric wins -- and loses</HEADLINE>

THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) has upheld many of
Scottish Hydro-Electric's objections to distribution and pricing
controls proposed by the industry regulator Stephen Littlechild. But the
overall financial impact of its recommendations is neutral.
Ironically, the biggest beneficiary of the MMC report may well be
Hydro-Electric's South of Scotland stablemate ScottishPower.
ScottishPower shares rose 6p to 343p yesterday while those of every
other electricity company fell.
The MMC proposes a new price formula for power generation in Scotland
which would allow both companies to charge domestic consumers slightly
more.
But its report, published yesterday, demands stringent cost cuts at
Hydro-Electric which would claw back most of this extra revenue.
''Scottish Hydro-Electric will probably be a bit disappointed that
they have ended up with less revenues in distribution than they would
have hoped, although this has been offset by a better deal on generation
costs,'' said Andrew Wright, an electricity analyst with broker Smith
New Court.
''I think the market was expecting more from this,'' he added, noting
the 6[1/2]p decline in Hydro-Electric's share price to 336[1/2]p.
All other UK electricity companies except ScottishPower were dragged
lower by the MMC report, which dampened hopes of a lenient review of
their own price regimes by Professor Littlechild next month.
Hydro-Electric, which announced an 11.1% rise in operating profits to
#196.8m on Wednesday, declared itself well satisfied with the MMC
report.
''We are very pleased that all our key objectives have been met,''
said chief executive Roger Young.
''Roughly speaking the MMC proposals make a #20m difference to our
revenue over a five-year period,'' he added.
''The disagreement with OFFER was not about the overall income of the
company, but about its distribution,'' Mr Young said.
The MMC says Hydro-Electric needs to make more money from electricity
distribution to pay for the renewal of power lines in the north of
Scotland than Professor Littlechild was willing to concede.
It recommends that Hydro-Electric cut the price of electricity
delivered to domestic consumers by 8.5% in real terms over four years.
This is less than the 10% cut demanded by Professor Littlechild in
October.
The MMC also seeks formal recognition of the company's right to use
large profits from hydro-electric power generation to subsidise
higher-than-average distribution costs to remote highland and island
communities.
The MMC says this cross-subsidy, known as the Hydro Benefit, should
continue at up to #40m per year to allow the company a guaranteed 7%
rate of return on investment in the distribution sector.
Furthermore it says Hydro-Electric should invest #247m in renewing
power lines to remote communities in the highlands and islands -- #22m
more than OFFER had deemed necessary.
But while granting these concessions, the MMC wants the Perth-based
company to cut its operating costs by 2% a year in real terms over four
years.
OFFER had only asked for a 1% annual cost reduction.
Professor Littlechild is not bound to accept all the MMC
recommendations, but his initial reaction to the report was favourable.
''Although there are differences of detail, the overall effect of the
MMC's recommendations are similar to my own earlier proposals,'' he
said.
''Hydro-Electric is better off than it was when it went to the MMC,''
said Ian Graham, an electricity analyst with Natwest Securities.
''But ScottishPower appears to gain more from this than Hydro because
it will get the Great Britain yardstick benefit that the MMC proposes,''
he added.
Unlike the other UK regional electricity companies which buy in most
of their power, ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric generate surplus
electricity.
The prices they charge domestic consumers are therefore partly indexed
to English and Welsh prices through a mechanism called the Great Britain
yardstick.
The MMC says this yardstick should be calculated differently so that
it reflects domestic user prices, while excluding the cheaper tariffs
levied on large industrial concerns.
If OFFER adopts this proposal, as appears likely, Hydro-Electric and
ScottishPower will both be able to charge domestic consumers more over
the next three years until the yardstick is phased out of their price
formulae.
''It would mean a good few million pounds for us,'' a ScottishPower
spokesman said, welcoming the ''very positive implications'' of the MMC
report.
But industry sources said that if ScottishPower does receive the
benefit of a more favourable price yardstick, it may also have to accept
other less favourable revisions of its price control regime in
accordance with other MMC recommendations for Hydro-Electric.
''You cannot just open the bits of the Pandora's Box that you like.
It's full of snakes as well as plums,'' one source said.

ELIZABETH WESTCOTT with a vital guide
for those starting
their own business
A QUICK glance at the cover of Roz Morris's Working for Yourself: How
to Succeed at Being Your Own Boss, could prove deceptive. I looked at
it, registered the phone, the pen, the computer screen, the word
''succeed'' in the title and my first thought was: do we really need
another of these how-to-succeed, get-rich-quickly books?
My first judgment could not have been more wrong. This is, in fact, a
must-have book for anyone who is bored or unhappy with their current
work situation (or lack of one) and considering self-employment.
Informative and well-researched, Working for Yourself explains much of
the grassroots knowledge essential to self-employment, but is too often
learned by trial and error.
The first part of the book discusses self-assessment; are you really
the sort of person who can cope with ''the buck stops here''
accountability? The questionnaires look simplistic, but can be very
revealing about your personal style. As one small businessman complained
recently: ''everyone's waiting to take a pop at you,'' and the
inevitable problems with legalities, such as council regulations and
taxes, could be the kiss of death for those who want the luxury of being
their own boss without the responsibility.
Morris goes on to discuss how to utilise your existing hobbies and
make them earn money for you, how to build a skills portfolio, and
learning to recognise a gap in the market. In one of the case studies
Morris uses to illustrate her points, a woman in Finland has made a
profitable business out of charging to look after graves, and now has
130,000 to maintain. Her example inspired a Gloucestershire couple who
have set up a similar enterprise in Britain. The idea is to identify a
genuine need, then answer it with a marketable service.
Of course, it's not always that easy, as Morris is quick to point out.
You may have a fabulous idea, but translating it into action requires
the less imaginative spadework. As Vidal Sassoon once said: ''The only
place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.'' Morris
sets forth the seemingly obvious questions you should ask yourself, and
advises on drawing up business plans, isolating a unique selling point
(or USP if you like jargon), advertising and setting fees, debt
collection, financing, and dealing with financial agencies. An appendix
lists the organisations you may need.
Finally, Morris has some advice on homeworking etiquette. As anyone
who has worked from home knows too well, it's difficult to avoid the
displacement activity trap, where you find yourself doing everything but
that difficult project you should be doing. Morris discusses time
management, how to maintain a professional image even through simple
things like answering the phone and dressing properly; and she has a few
tips on coping with stress and keeping up personal fitness.
More small businesses are starting up in Britain now than at any time
since the late eighties. The continual shifting of work patterns is
leading increasing numbers of people to consider the self-employment
option. Roz Morris's Working for Yourself is itself answering a need,
with well-timed information.

CHECK-OUT
* KILLER Whale Stalks North Sea Oil Rig! Not a tabloid headline, as it
happens, but a riveting piece of actuality from Nature Detectives,
caught by a viewer. Gearing up for the summer season, BBC1's flagship
wildlife magazine programme has sent out an SOS for more equally
gripping footage.
It can be recorded on any format -- Hi8, VHS, film -- and quality or
length are not paramount: as long as it's captured something interesting
(like a hedgehog carrying its babies) your camcorder could make you
famous for 60 seconds as the credits roll.
Scottish wildlife items are particularly welcomed by Nature
Detectives, BBC Television, Bristol BS8 2LR -- 0117-973 2211.
* WHO'S for tennis -- and strawberries? They almost go hand in hand --
which prompts Marks &amp; Spencer to serve up a few statistical volleys:
what numbers 10 million, weighs 2000 tonnes, and is big enough to cover
100 tennis courts? It's the amount of strawberries they will sell us in
a week -- all hand-picked -- chilled, and on sale within 24 hours.
Meantime, after research with fruit growers, Sainsbury's are confident
of a winner in Elsanta -- ''the ultimate British strawberry''. It should
also mean net savings for customers when it goes on sale this month
loose, for shoppers who prefer to pick'n'mix, alongside pre-packs.
* IF THE well-manicured Wimbledon turf reminds you that your lawnmower
is no longer a cut above the rest, now is a good time to think about
replacing it. Prices are set to rise -- Flymo has flagged up a 10%
increase; Al-Ko, Atco, Qualcast, Black and Decker, Hayter and Mountfield
also say an autumn hike is likely. Meantime, the McCulloch LawnMac ML322
is being recalled by the manufacturer after the Consumers' Association
found a potentially dangerous electrical fault. Owners should call 01924
221200 if they have not already been contacted about repair or
replacement.
* ACCORDING to COMA, the Government committee on medical aspects of
food policy, Scots need to cut down on fat to protect against heart
disease. Now there's a new suspect -- trans fatty acids. These come
about with hydrogenation, a hardening process when small particles of
nickel or copper are added to vegetable oil, heated up and blasted with
hydrogen gas.
Essential fatty acids are destroyed and replaced with deformed trans
fatty acids, which can clog the arteries. Whole Earth Foods have come up
with a healthy alternative: SuperSpread has no hydrogenated fat or dairy
ingredients and is low in saturates.
Supermarkets are unlikely to stock it, but Green City Wholefoods,
Fleming Street, Glasgow, Holland and Barrett branches and other health
shops do. For a leaflet that also contains recipes, write to Whole Earth
Foods, 269 Portobello Road, London W11 1LR. (0171-229 7545).
* NEW guidelines have revised the recommended daily allowances for 12
vitamins and six minerals. Boots offer a free leaflet explaining the
changes and who can benefit from taking supplements -- for example
Vitamin B1, which releases energy from food and aids the nervous system,
can be particularly useful for pregnant women, the elderly, drinkers,
and athletes. The leaflet is available from Boots' stores, or write to
Boots Health and Nutrition Centre, Freepost (RDA), The Boots Company,
Nottingham NG2 3AA.
* END PIECES: 300,000 copies of the 1995 Edinburgh Festival Fringe
programme are rolling off the presses and volunteers are needed this
weekend to mail it out. Fringe benefits include free lunches and
T-shirts. Phone 0131-226 5257 . . . Scottish Roots by Alwyn James (yes,
he's Welsh!) is a fascinating step-by-step guide for ancestor-hunters.
From the Saltire Society, it includes tips on making the most of New
Register House, the Scottish Record Office, libraries and other sources.
Rattle some skeletons for #4.99 . . . Holidaymakers and business
travellers who pick up their travel money from the Royal Bank of

JEREMY Bates' anticipation betrayed him just when he needed it most in
the Stella Artois event yesterday, and he paid the penalty against Pete
Sampras.
The Englishman looked sure to force Sampras into a third set but,
after having served for a 6-5, second-set lead, he lowered his racket
and watched in horror as a Sampras return landed well inside the
baseline.
Sampras won the next three points and the following game to complete
an inconsistent 6-3, 7-5 third-round victory.
''I thought he'd hit it too hard,'' said Bates. ''The ball was so far
in it was unbelievable. Then I played three loose points to lose my
serve.''
Sampras relied heavily on his big serve when danger threatened. ''He's
not as dominant as last year but the serve is there when he needs it''
added Bates.
Boris Becker reached the quarter-final stage despite an injury scare.
He needed treatment for a calf strain during his 6-4, 6-2 defeat of
Argentina's Javier Frana.
''You are always concerned when something like this happens,'' said
the German. ''The muscle started to tighten but I do not think it's too
serious.''
In Birmingham, Lori McNeil moved closer to completing a hat trick of
titles at the DFS Classic by reaching the quarter-finals with a 6-3, 6-3
win over Australian Kristin Godridge.
McNeil, who defeated Steffi Graf in last year's Wimbledon
championships, said: ''It has always been my goal to win Wimbledon, and
after what I achieved last year, I'm more convinced I can do it.''
The American's hopes of collecting a third title at Birmingham soared
when No.2 seed Gigi Fernandez limped out of the reckoning with a damaged
ankle. But Zina Garrison Jackson, runner-up to McNeil last year, beat
Laura Golarsa in two sets.
* SCOTTISH No.1 Michel Mair earned herself a place in next week's
Wimbledon qualifying event at Roehampton when she trounced British
junior champion Fiona Lishman 6-1, 6-0 in yesterday's final round of the
all-British pre-qualifier at Surbiton.
* DUNBLANE HS boys won the Ritchies of Edinburgh Scottish Schools Team
championships while George Watson's College retained the girls' title at
Craiglockhart yesterday. Results:
Boys: Semi-finals -- George Heriot's beat Annan Academy 8-0; Dunblane
HS beat Hutchesons' GS 8-2. 3/4 play-off -- Hutchesons' beat Annan 7-3.
Final -- Dunblane beat Heriot's 8-4.
Girls: Semi-finals -- George Watson's College beat Lomond 8-5; Cults
Academy beat Bearsden Academy 8-0. 3/4 play-off -- Lomond beat Bearsden
7-2. Final -- George Watson's beat Cults 7-4.
* RESULTS from the West of Scotland Open at Giffnock:
Men's singles quarter-finals -- M Watt (Newlands) beat O Hadden
(Stirling University) 6-3, 6-0: I Campbell (Western) beat T Smith
(Giffnock) 6-4, 6-2; J Russell (Cults) beat R Terras (Newlands) 7-6,
6-7, 6-2; C McKnight (Newlands) beat I McAuley (Newlands) 6-4, 7-5.

Ann Shaw investigates the costs of generic medications compared with
brand-name drugs and finds that it pays to quiz the pharmacist
IS it worth purchasing brand-name drugs at the chemist's -- or should
you opt for one of the cheaper generic alternatives? Brand loyalty may
persuade consumers to stick to the product they have used for years but
often they are paying more than they have to. To add to the confusion,
the friendly pharmacist may say you can buy the same medicine over the
counter for less than the cost of the prescription charge of #5.45.
(True, but don't forget that the prescription for hay-fever, say, is
likely to be for a month's supply whereas the cheaper packet of
hay-fever pills may only last a week. So do your sums carefully.)
However, it's a fallacy to think that brand names are superior to
generics which are produced when the patent on a brand-name drug
expires. They are cheaper because they do not have to cover the costs of
research, marketing or glossy packaging.
The Which? report on painkillers says that the generic forms of
paracetamol and aspirin are not only much cheaper than branded items,
but just as effective; Boots BP aspirin tablets work out at 3p a dose
compared with 17p for Aspro.
Some years ago the Consumers' Association looked into the matter in
depth and listed a number of medicines that are cheaper to buy over the
counter than the standard prescription charge, including many
decongestants, cough relievers, anti-diarrhoea pills, skin creams, and
lozenges.
About 65% of drugs have a generic substitute -- the others are still
under patent -- according to Department of Health figures.
In Scotland, 50% of GPs already write prescriptions for generics, and
in some areas it's as high as 60% to 70% of prescriptions. Yet only 10
years ago it was about 30%.
Generic companies are effectively tied in to the research and
development cycle of the large innovative firms, a point acknowledged by
the chairman of the British Generic Manufacturers Association: ''Today's
branded medicine is tomorrow's generic; the research-based sector
provides the seed corn for us.'' The industry's assertion that cutbacks
in R &amp; D will harm patients should, says the National Consumer Council,
be carefully assessed.
Ian Mullen, a pharmacist in Falkirk, said: ''My advice is to ask your
pharmacist if there is a generic equivalent if you are going for
over-the-counter drugs. A further point: all drugs sold in this country
have to carry a British product licence and will have been produced to
the same standard as brand-name drugs.''
So, the problem of cheaper versions produced in Third World countries
which do not conform to UK standards is not something we have to worry
about.
But what about consumer resistance? Do we not prefer brand names we
are familiar with? ''That used to be the case,'' said Mullen. ''At first
people are surprised to discover the price difference but it's accepted
now.''
He said the reluctance on most people's part is more to do with the
physical appearance of the drug: ''They might for years have been given
a pink oval tablet. Suddenly their doctor prescribes one that is blue
and round and they are concerned that it may not be as effective. The
problem is a psychological one.''
He added a small caveat: even though drugs have the same active
ingredient some people come back and complain to their pharmacist that
the generic is not as effective as the brand name. Mullen has come to
the conclusion that while the drugs may chemically be identical, there
is something in the way some people metabolise drugs that changes the
effect -- they may be slower producing a reaction, reflecting a
biological difference.
This is a point made by the National Consumer Council in their report
on drugs: ''Generics are not invariably identical in make-up to a
brand-name drug but they always have the same active ingredient. The
difference is important as they may not have the same biological effect
in the body.''
The National Consumer Council said there was a danger of creating a
two-tier system of prescribing similar to that between private practice
and Medicaid in the United States. More affluent practices offered their
patients greater choice of drugs while those living in poorer areas
received a restricted range of cheaper medicines.
Ever since Aneurin Bevan complained about ''the ceaseless cascade of
medicine pouring down British throats'' the Government has cast a
predatory eye on the NHS drugs bill, currently around #3 billion.
Today it is committed to encouraging generic products as a means of
reducing the cost.
The largest volume of prescribing is for the elderly, something that
the Government has been quick to point out. Anti-arthritic generic drugs
represent a substantial saving against branded products. For example,
Zyloric costs #4.05 as against the generic allopurinol for 50p.
A branded version of the anti-depressant amitriptyline costs nearly
six times as much as the generic version.
It pays to ask your chemist if there is a generic form of any drug you
are planning to buy.

DAVID Ray brought his local pub landlord to caddie for him at the DHL
Jersey Open yesterday -- and it was cheers all round in the La Moye
clubhouse.
The Bristol golfer shot an eight-under-par 64 to share the lead with
defending champion Paul Curry and Malcolm Mackenzie.
It was a welcome return to form for Ray, who admitted: ''My game has
got to such a stage that after talking it over with my father, we
thought it might be best to take a year out.''
Ray, currently 160th on the order of merit, spent two hours practising
on Wednesday night with the result that he completed his round in just
30 putts.
The highlight of Mackenzie's round was an eagle 3 at the 482-yard
sixteenth, where he hit a huge drive then left his No.7-iron approach
shot just two inches from the hole.
Curry again showed a liking for the cliff-top course where he set a
tournament record 22-under-par total of 266 last year. ''I hope my form
continues. The course is playing short and that helps me a bit. A 59 is
a possibility,'' he said.
Ronan Rafferty, whose earnings on Tour stretch to over #2m, lies two
strokes behind, as does Scottish rookie Dean Robertson. Rafferty spoiled
a fine round with a bogey 5 at the seventeenth.
Robertson went out in 35, but birdied five of the next six holes,
including four in a row. Leading scores (British and Irish unless
otherwise stated):
64 -- M Mackenzie, P Curry, D Ray.
66 -- R Rafferty, D Robertson.
67 -- L Westwood.
68 -- M Nichols, G Levenson (S Africa), D Williams, P Moloney, E
Darcy, H Clark, B Davis, D Carter, A Murray.
69 -- A Sorensen (Denmark), J Gronhagen (Sweden), J Payne, R Boxall, P
Affleck, R McFarlane, O Karlsson (Sweden), J McHenry, R Wessels (S
Africa), S Watson, J Robson.
70 -- I Palmer (S Africa), G Ralph, C Mason, D Cooper, G Turner (New
Zealand), M Gates, R Drummond, C Cassells, A Oldcorn, W Stephens, P
Broadhurst, S Richardson, P Haugsrud (Norway), G Hjertsted (Sweden).
Other scores included: 71 -- B Marchbank. 72 -- B Longmuir. 73 -- M
Miller. 77 -- A Coltart. 79 -- C Ronald.

MHAIRI McKay won at the first extra hole in her match with Sweden's
Sophie Eriksson yesterday in the second round of the British Women's
Amateur championship at Royal Portrush.
The 20-year-old former British Girls' champion levelled the match at
the seventeenth, where when her opponent found the rough. At the
nineteenth both drove the rough, but McKay recovered best to take the
hole with a par.
Her Curtis Cup colleague, Janice Moodie, posted convincing wins over
Andrea Murray and Suzanne Fanagan to line up opposite Stirling
University sports scholarship student Anna Berg, of Sweden.
Haddington's Lesley Nicholson produced a 4 and 2 win over Welsh Curtis
Cup player Vicki Thomas to book her place against home player Helen
Jones, who knocked out holder Emma Duggleby.
Jones was taken unawares on the first tee. Under the impression she
was meeting Nicholson, the Stabane golfer topped her tee shot after
Duggleby introduced herself. Selected results:
First round --  Hall (Felixstowe Ferry) beat C Grady (Bawburgh), 3 and
2; L Nicholson (Haddington) beat E Ratcliffe (Stirling University), 6
and 4; E Duggleby (Malton and Norton) beat E Dickson (St Andrews
University), 8 and 7; J Moodie (Windyhill) beat A Murray (Lancaster), 2

THERE was a bit of everything at Raeburn Place yesterday. The sun
shone all day, more than 550 runs were scored, in addition to the
appearance of three streakers. Carl Hooper inquired as to the well-being
of Andy Goram, the Rangers goalkeeper and one-time cricket
internationalist, while Courtney Walsh took time to pose for pictures
with toddlers while fielding on the boundary.
In all, it was enthralling day in the capital -- even without Brian
Lara.
The West Indies beat Scotland by 47 runs in the James Capel one-day
international but the result was incidental, with no-one in the 5000
crowd leaving early after an unforgettable day.
The West Indies batted first, but the Scots made the first impression
when paceman Kevin Thomson clean-bowled Test opener Sherwin Campbell for
a duck. Tour captain Richie Richardson then indulged in a stand of 61
with opener Stuart Williams, before the Windies skipper trailed off in
disgust after having snicked one to Iain Philip off Mike Allingham.
Jimmy Adams joined Williams and the pair hammered a third-wicket stand
of 134 in just 78 minutes. Adams -- who formerly was with Royal High in
the capital -- took only 77 balls to make his 57 before finding Jim
Govan at point.
Williams was next to go, but not before he had crashed his way to a
superb ton. His 100 came off just 112 balls, with one 6 and seventeen
boundaries. He went on to hit five more 4s before being claimed by
Williamson when he skied a catch to George Salmond. The departure of
Williams heralded a minor collapse, with four wickets going down for
just nine runs.
Courtney Browne smashed a 6 then a 4 off successive Williamson
deliveries to bring up the 300. The Scots were left with 306 to win and,
while that was never a realistic proposition, they really made a game of
it.
Having lost skipper Alastair Storie for seven, opener Iain Philip and
Mike Smith set about the West Indies' seam and spin attack.
They took the score to 108 for one at tea, Philip with a half-century
while Smith stood on 43, which included 6s off Walsh and Rajindra
Dhanraj.
But the tea-break came at the wrong time for the Scots, with Smith out
without adding to his score, quickly followed by Gordon McGurk.
Philip advanced to 65 before being clean-bowled by Adams, the
Stenhousemuir batsman striking nine boundaries in his top score.
Against a less than fearsome Caribbean attack, Greig Williamson and
George Salmond went some way to cementing their place in the Scotland
side. Williamson blasted two 6s off Chanderpaul, then clubbed another 6
off Adams which drew applause from the Jamaican all-rounder.
His Clydesdale counterpart brought up his 50 off just 55 balls, and
not to be outdone, Salmond crashed Adams over the ropes off successive
deliveries to bring up the Scots' 250.
From the third-last ball, Williamson picked out Walsh on the boundary,
and was out for 57. The fall of that wicket brought about a pitch
invasion, and with a set of stumps nicked from one end the tourists
decided to call it a day a few balls early. Scoreboard:

COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP
ESSEX paceman Mark Ilott secured a hat trick of lbws -- only the sixth
in first-class cricket, and the first since 1979 -- and the best bowling
return of the season as championship leaders Northamptonshire crumbled
to 46 all out when 30 wickets fell on a sensational day at Luton.
Ilott finished with nine for 19 -- in the space of only 36 balls -- as
Northants recorded their lowest post-war total and the worst
championship score since Lancashire bowled Essex out for 43 in 1989.
Essex were dismissed for 127 and then 107. Northants -- facing a
target of 189 -- were one without loss by the close.
However, despite the staggering tally of wickets, the umpires
confirmed that there was no question of the pitch being reported as
unfit.
Robin Smith scored 136, his second century of the season, to rescue
Hampshire at Bristol while England skipper Mike Atherton batted at No.8
for Lancashire because of a back injury but insisted it would not affect
his Test availability for Lord's next week.
Yorkshire's Martyn Moxon (158 not out) featured in an opening stand of
132 with Michael Vaughan (71), South African Daryll Cullinan hit 161
from 228 balls for Derbyshire, while James Whitaker (127) and Jonathan
Dakin (87 not out) led a Leicestershire recovery from 60-4 to 356-8
against Nottinghamshire. Scores:
At Derby. Derbyshire 376 (D J Cullinan 161, A S Rollins 56; Mushtaq
Ahmed 5-107) v Somerset.
At Colwyn Bay. Glamorgan 276 (H A G Anthony 58, H Morris 53);
Middlesex 43-1.
At Bristol. Hampshire 323-9 (R A Smith 136, K D James 51no; A M Smith
4-68) v Gloucestershire.
At Leicester. Leicestershire 356-8 (J J Whitaker 127, J M Dakin 87no)
v Nottinghamshire.
At Luton. Essex 127 (R J Rollins 52no; D J Capel 5-29) and 107 (J P
Taylor 7-50); Northamptonshire 46 (M C Ilott 9-19) and 1-0.
At Horsham. Surrey 187 (E S H Giddins 4-54, J Lewry 4-77); Sussex

A PAIR of shoes sparked off a big air and sea search yesterday before
being finally reunited with their red-faced owner.
The alarm was raised when the shoes were found on the Kessock Bridge
at Inverness, a spot often used for suicide attempts. A concerned
passer-by called the police, who immediately feared that someone had
jumped off the bridge.
The coastguard was alerted, and the local inshore lifeboat and a
helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth scoured the inner Moray Firth for signs
of a body.
But when the search revealed nothing, it was stood down and the shoes
were logged by police as lost property.
Some hours later, a holidaymaker called at Inverness police
headquarters to report a lost pair of shoes.
He had placed them on the roof of his car, forgotten to retrieve them
before driving off, and they had fallen off on the Kessock Bridge.
A police spokesman said: ''It was a well-intentioned report. We are
not upset at having to organise an elaborate and fruitless search. The
public should not be discouraged from raising an alarm. It is better to
be safe than sorry.''

STEVE Martin continued to defy health problems and the daunting Nairn
links yesterday to maintain the lead at the halfway stage of the #22,500
BBA Northern Open, writes Scott Crockett.
He added a 69 to his opening 67 for an eight-under-par total of 136,
giving the 39-year-old the lead by three strokes from Anglo-Scot Steven
MacPherson.
But Martin -- yet to win a 72-hole event -- yesterday sought relief
from a ringing in his ears, then there's his dodgy right knee, plus the
wear and tear apparent in his right wrist.
''I had a bit of a problem with my left ear yesterday, but now it
seems to have spread to my right,'' said Steve. ''I took some tablets,
but they haven't done any good.''
Martin carded four birdies in his opening eight holes, with his only
other departure from par coming on the final green, where he
three-putted.
136 -- S Martin (North Engineering) 67, 69.

<HEADLINE>Pressures of huge jackpots blamed Lottery man died for #27</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977862823</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DISTRAUGHT man who killed himself in the belief that he had missed
out on a #2m National Lottery jackpot would only have won #27, an
inquest was told yesterday.
Father-of-two Mr Timothy O'Brien, 51, shot himself because he had
forgotten to renew a ticket that he thought contained all six winning
numbers. In fact the ticket had only four winning numbers -- and was
worth just #27, the Liverpool inquest heard.
After hearing the tragic case of Mr O'Brien, of Old Swan, Liverpool,
coroner Mr Roy Barter questioned the need for massive prizes like last
week's #22m pay-out.
''I wonder whether it is the sheer size of the sums of money involved
which is one of the causes of what could potentially become a serious
social problem,'' he told the court.
However, lottery organiser Camelot defended the massive cash bonanzas.
A spokesman said research showed big prizes equalled big ticket sales
and maximised the amounts raised for good causes.
The coroner, recording a verdict of suicide, asked: ''Might the
pressures which may be imposed on some people be lessened if the sums
involved were not as vast?
''Say in a roll-over week where there is #20m to be won, might it not
be better if 40 people each won #500,000 or if 80 people won #250,000
each? Surely that is a sufficiently large sum to satisfy anyone.''
Earlier this week Prime Minister John Major acknowledged that many
people were concerned about the size of roll-over jackpots.
But the Camelot spokesman said: ''We are confident that the current
prize structure of both the on-line lottery and Instants games are the
most effective ones for raising money for the good causes.
''They also appear to be popular with the paying public. We do not
believe that there is potentially a serious social problem with large
jackpots.''
Mr O'Brien, a tool inspector, made an agreement with workmate Mr Steve
Sumner when the lottery began last November. Under it they would stake
50p each a week in five-week blocks and divide any winnings, the inquest
was told.
Mrs Maureen O'Brien said her husband checked the results on Sunday,
April 9, and had thought that their numbers -- 14, 24, 33, 38, 42, and
47 -- had come up.
''He came to me and said he had forgotten to renew the ticket and it
was invalid,'' said a tearful Mrs O'Brien. ''He was very distressed.''
She told how Mr O'Brien, a local gun club member, made desperate
attempts to find Mr Sumner's phone number, and went to his house only to
find he was away for the weekend.
He went up to his attic, telling his wife he was still looking for the
number. Mrs O'Brien said she had not heard him moving about for a few
minutes so she climbed the loft ladder and found her husband sitting
with blood on him.
''I am quite sure that his concern when he realised that the ticket
had not been renewed was not for himself but for his workmate,'' she
said.
Mr Sumner told the inquest that he returned from his weekend away to
find a note through his letterbox which read: ''Steve, I forgot to put
the numbers on. Sorry, Tim.''
He went on: ''I checked them right away and I realised that we hadn't
won. We didn't have all six numbers; we had four.''
Mr Sumner had not been too worried about a #54 win split two ways and
had planned to mention it next day at Yorkshire Imperial Metals, Kirkby,
where they both worked. Instead he was told by his bosses that his
friend was dead.
The coroner's concern comes days after Mr Mark Gardiner, who won #11m
last weekend, went into hiding abroad in an attempt to escape reporters
after seeing his ex-wives and girlfriends fill page after page of
tabloid newsprint with allegations of his infidelity and violence.
Meanwhile, fruit machine takings are down 11% since the launch of
lottery scratchcards, says a report by Bacta, the amusement machine
industry trade association.

SOUTH African Laurette Maritz-Atkins upstaged the all-conquering Laura
Davies with an eight-under-par 65 in the first round of the OVB Austrian
Open at Zell am See yesterday, writes Bill Johnson.
While Davies was compiling a 70, Maritz-Atkins, based in Hampshire
where her husband Leigh is the professional at Sandford Springs, took
the lead by one stroke from Annika Sorenstam and Wendy Doolan.
There was also a change of fortune for Scotland's Julie Forbes, whose
car was written off on the way to Austria. Forbes, the French Open
champion, shot a 70.
It is five years since Maritz-Atkins won the last of her three
European titles and her 65 is the lowest round of her career. A streak
player, she birdied the first three holes, then added five more in seven
holes from the ninth.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
65 -- L Maritz-Atkins (S Africa).
66 -- W Doolan (Australia), A Sorenstam (Sweden).
67 -- C Dibnah (Australia).
68 -- E Orley (Switzerland), R Carriedo (Spain), H Wadsworth, A
Brighouse.
69 -- F Dassu (Italy), D Barnard, M-L de Lorenzi (France).
70 -- N Buxton, L Fairclough, J Forbes, S Prosser, A Arruti (Spain), T
Fischer (Germany), S Mendiburu (France), K Davies, L Davies, S Moon
(USA).
Other Scottish scores: 71 -- G Stewart. 73 -- T Craik. 74 -- M
McKinlay. 75 -- D Reid. 77 -- L Irvine. 80 -- C Panton-Lewis.
* PETER McLeod, of Alloa, parred the twenty-first hole of the
Clackmannan Matchplay final last night to beat clubmate Alan Watson.
* OLIVER Lindsay will meet Lee Bain tonight in the final of the

I WRITE in response to Dr Murdo MacLean's letter over his application
to become a non-executive director of Argyll and Bute NHS Trust (June
12).
It may be helpful to clear up Dr MacLean's apparent misunderstanding
over the process after submission of applications to the Scottish Office
and subsequent procedure undertaken by the Irons Committee established
to consider all such appointments to NHS trusts.
During the set-up period for new NHS trusts, applications are handled
at the Scottish Office and not at local management level. Therefore it
is erroneous to suggest that Argyll and Bute NHS Trust has acted in a
secretive or discourteous manner.
From its inception Argyll and Bute NHS Trust has adopted a policy of
openness with all monthly trust board meetings open to the public and
standing invitations given to representatives from Argyll and Clyde
local health councils and the local press. Full details of the
non-executive director appointments were released to all local
newspapers who chose to edit and present the information accordingly.
Any applicant should, through common courtesy, be advised whether or
not they have been successful, but Dr MacLean should receive
notification from the Scottish Office, not Argyll and Bute NHS Trust.
Dr MacLean, like any other interested member of the general public, is
welcome to attend any future monthly trust board meetings.

Chief Executive,
Argyll and Bute NHS Trust,

ONE of my uncles was killed in the Quintinshill rail catastrophe in
1915. It was only recently that I heard it called by the name of
Quintinshill (as in your Weekender article on May 20). Throughout my
life the incident has always been referred to as the Gretna Disaster.
My father visited the scene as soon as he could to trace his brother
but could not get any news at all. It was a total shambles with dead
bodies and burning wreckage still lying around after some days had
passed.
It was only when a sergeant asked which part of the train my uncle had
been in and was told it was the first carriage that he immediately said:
''I am sorry to say that there are no survivors from that part of the
train. There are not even any bodies as the third train crashing into
the wreckage set the whole thing ablaze!'' The family was devastated.
Much of Leith was the same. It was an area of sorrow.

YOUR Perspective headline, Time for men in white coats? (June 13), is
most apt. Those of us who have long held the opinion that the former
Prime Minister is a mite eccentric have had our prejudices converted
into rational judgments many times over by her increasingly bizarre
behaviour since she was forced out of Downing Street.
First there was the metamorphosis from the Rt Hon Margaret Thatcher,
MP, into Lady Marlboro Thatcher, drummer extraordinaire for the American
tobacco industry which agreed to pay her large sums of money to help her
set up the ludicrous Thatcher Foundation in return for her influence in
helping them to penetrate the markets of the Third World.
In becoming involved in this sordid business, she was merely following
the precedent established by her political soulmate Ronald Reagan who,
in an earlier incarnation, advertised the Chesterfield brand of
cigarettes.
Secondly there was the exquisitely deranged behaviour she displayed
during the interviews which were part of the mini-series screened in the
autumn of 1993 by the BBC as a puff for the first volume of her turgid,
self-serving memoirs.
It was most amusing to hear her during these broadcasts describe the
conduct of Lords Howe and Lawson as ''grubby'' when they forced her to
agree, in principle, to Britain's membership of the ERM. What could be
grubbier than taking backhanders from an American tobacco company to
help fund her delusions of statesmanship?
To be fair to her, she behaved in a more rational manner during her
recent extended television commercial with Sir David Frost. It was only
near the end of this extravagant plug for volume two of her memoirs that
her true personality broke free.
Last year the press was full of her folie de grandeur when she
exhibited all the signs of a condition that can only be described as the
Louis XIV Syndrome which causes the sufferer to believe that the French
king's dictum L'Etat c'est moi applies to herself.
What other possible explanation could there have been for her
outrageous demand that Mrs Major cease wearing her necklace? Far from
being the Thatcher Diamonds, the jewellery in question is the property
of the State to be worn by the Prime Minister, if a woman, or his wife.
It is certainly not the personal property of the Prime Minister of the
day.
It is bad enough when she uses the royal ''we'' but when she starts to
regard herself as the embodiment of the State, we have reached the stage
when something must be done.
Perhaps she could be confined to Windsor Castle where she can stroll
the grounds and harangue the trees in the belief that she is addressing
a summit of EU leaders. After all, poor George III mistook those very
trees for the King of Prussia.

THE two most pressing needs for a resolution of the Lockerbie
stalemate are a fair trial and a full objective inquiry into the role
played by British (and American) intelligence.
Regional councillor Ernie Turpie's support for the latter is most
welcome. Nor need Chief Constable Essen fear such a request, aimed not
at the hard-working men who delved so long and hard for evidence across
so many miles of moorland, but at those who were supposed to support his
investigation, and use it to bring the perpetrators to justice (June 9).
He will remember the unprecedented co-operation which the Germans were
said to be giving. So, like us, he must want to know why the German
Ministry of Justice (in Bonn) wrote to us in February this year claiming
that ''they had no knowledge of the bomb having passed through Frankfurt
airport'' -- a crucial area for the ''official version''.
He must wonder why, when Mr Tam Dalyell MP asked the Prime Minister if
he would raise the matter with Chancellor Kohl, the answer was No.
As for a trial, we should all wonder that our Government can say it
sees no reason to hold a trial in a neutral country. The absence of the
accused from a Scottish or US court provides the reason. Sanctions as at
present worded have not worked.
The UK and US chose to work through the Security Council to impose
sanctions which could only be satisfied by ''surrender of the accused
for trial in Britain or America''. It is not reasonable to ask that the
UK and US now go back to the Security Council and ask that the words be
amended to say only ''be surrendered for trial'', without specifying
where the trial venue should be?
It would seem then only a small step also to ask the United Nations to
examine the trial facility which they already have at the Hague for the
trial of Bosnian war criminals to see that it meets the criteria for the
release of Mr Duff's clients, as promised by Libya.
Justice Richard Goldstone and his staff at the Hague, given the
agreement of the Dutch Government, could then provide the infrastructure
for the Lockerbie trial without further delay.

Strong points: Keith Bruce examines the new-look Edinburgh Festival
Fringe brochure and whets the appetite for an arts feast.
IT can be confidently predicted that there will be no public
breast-beating over the redesign of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe
brochure. It still rolls up nicely into the palm of the hand and slips
easily into the back pocket of one's chinos. It will still, inevitably,
begin to disintegrate before the end of week two if subjected to
anything like serious Fringe-going usage.
But there can be no denying that admistrator Hilary Strong's revamp of
the Edinburgh-in-August bible is for the better. From artist Robert
Matthews's map reference cover work to Zumbi by Black Theatre Co-op, the
Fringe programme is clearer and more user-friendly. The typeface may not
have changed, but the clarity of the reproduction is hugely improved.
Its readability may attract new eyes and those familiar with the
techniques of using the publication will not be put off by the changes.
Chief among those is the subdivision of events into eight broad
categories: children's shows, comedy and revue, dance and physical
theatre, music, musicals and opera, talks and events, theatre, and
exhibtions. Not as contrary to the come-all-ye spirit of the Fringe as
it sounds, this actually clarifies things for the Fringe-goer.
The inclusion of Frantic Theatre's production of John Osborne's Look
Back In Anger in the Dance &amp; Physical Theatre section, for instance,
makes it -- for this writer at least -- look a much more interesting
prospect.
The hegemony of the big venues has also been subtlely diluted in
parallel with this change by the removal of double entries, under both
producing venue and act. Now performances either appear under their own
name (if the artists paid for the entry), or under the venue (if it, as
producer, forked out).
So now if it is your scene to spend the festival in the Assembly
Rooms, for example, you will be as well working from the venue's own
publication. Look under ''Assembly Rooms'' in any section of the Fringe
programme and you will only see part of what is on there. An expanded
venue index at the back has everything at every venue, in an
hour-by-hour list but gives titles and companies only.
There are 611 companies included, giving a total of 13,378
performances, and ticket sales are certain to breach the #1m sales
barrier this year -- not least thanks to the addition of a fourth
satellite box office at the Gyle Centre on the outskirts of Edinburgh.
It has two great virtues: it is on the road in from Glasgow and there is
parking at it.
The theatre section of the brochure is far and away the largest --
giving the lie to the perception that Edinburgh is awash with stand-up
comics. It makes up almost 40% of the total of shows, with music at 25%,
and comedy trailing at 17%. Shakespeare makes a comeback this year with
24 productions, including six Macbeths and five Hamlets.
The Fringe's most prolific contemporary writer, John Cargill Thomson,
has 11 shows at the Cafe Royal, including two sequels to works by the
bard -- Romeo and Juliet: Happily Ever After and Hamlet II: Prince of
Jutland. Steven Berkoff and Harold Pinter score a mere three plays each.
Every available space in the city will as usual be pressed into
service as a venue, so special recognition must go to Richard Demarco
whose programme has so outgrown his European Art Foundation premises in
Albany Street that it includes two productions, by Compagnie Yvette
Bozsik and Lithuania's Oskara Korsunovo Grupe, at Dundee Rep.
It is often suggested that much of the Fringe audience is made up of
people going to each other's shows, but with such a captive crowd of
thespians in the city, an initiative at the Fringe Club is sure to
attract a good attendance. The Fringe Society is hosting a series of
masterclasses by those at the top of the profession, including retiring
Royal National Theatre director Richard Eyre, comic actor Ken Campbell,
and dancer Lynn Seymour.
Other well-known names, include Angela Pleasance, playing Beckett, at
-- appropriately -- The Pleasance and TV presenter Annabel Giles, who is
looking for Mr Right in Looking For Mr Giles at the same venue. Those
who have been made into television comedy stars by the Fringe also
return, including Jack Dee, Sean Hughes, Julian Clary, Eddie Izzard,
Scotland's Phil Kay, and Australia's Perrier award winners last year
Lano and Woodley.
Almost 300 of the theatre shows are premieres, but there are also many
second (or third) chances to see acclaimed hits, including the perennial
Anorak of Fire, The Citizens' Trainspotting, Brazilian actress Denise
Stocklos as Mary Stuart, and Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch.
For the newer work, the title often does not give much of a clue: The
Man Who Turned Into A Stick and Two Men and A Penguin sound intriguing,
but cannot compete with Jeffrey Dahmer Is Unwell.
Inevitably the lure of the Fringe has proved too much for a member of
the Fourth Estate as I warned was a danger in last Thursday's Herald.
Despite the huge risks involved in putting on a show, BBC Radio producer
Dave Bachelor has adapted his acclaimed wireless work The Home Front for
a lunchtime show. He blamed ego and claimed to be belatedly worrying
about the workload: he is also distilling the festival into a daily
15-minute programme for Radio Five Live.
As Hilary Strong said yesterday: ''There will always be toe-curling
disasters to match the extraordinary successes.'' Best of luck, Dave.
* On Tuesday Mark Fisher talks to Hilary Strong about the importance
of encouraging the smaller companies.

MICHAEL FRY (Key to the past is to face the truth, June 14) is right
up to one point. It is certainly party of the politician's calling to
discuss major issues in terms which are accessible and comprehensible to
the general public.
Surely, though, the bigger part of the political common touch comes
from seeking out, understanding, and acting upon the issues that the
public itself regards as important. It is the decay of this capability
which has led to a growing, and surely alarming, disillusionment with
the democratic process across much of Europe, most certainly including
Scotland.
That is why Scottish Education and Action for Development has embarked
on a two-year programme of work, Shifting the Balance, to promote the
idea that decision-making processes should involve at every level
procedures to ensure the consultation and active participation of those
directly affected by the policies being formulated; and that public
bodies should take it as their democratic responsibility to help
alienated groups and individuals play an active part of policy-making.
As part of the project, we have been consulting widely throughout
Scotland and beyond on the best mechanisms for achieving this in local
government, and plan shortly to publish a charter which we hope all the
new unitary authorities will adopt ahead of taking charge of local
services in Scotland.
Michael Fry says that the national life of Scotland should be about
the organic growth of new values out of old ones. What he fails to
confront is the question of just how organic that growth can be if it
consists of politicians talking to -- or at -- the people, rather than
the other way round.

NICHOLAS BUDGEN'S article, Return to a healthy scepticism on Europe
(June 14), displays the usual combination of rhetoric and misinformation
produced by the Tory Euro-sceptics as a substitute for debate.
He refers approvingly to Mrs Thatcher's position and claims that the
British people are becoming more and more sceptical about Europe. He
also states that: ''This week we've seen a huge display of public
opinion on British nationalism.'' Where is the evidence to back up his
faith in his past leader or his claim that people are becoming more
sceptical about Europe?
Although Mrs Thatcher is keen to rewrite history in the image of her
own rhetoric her deeds are there to contradict her. It was Mrs
Thatcher's Government who negotiated and signed the Single European Act
and accepted qualified majority voting.
She abandoned the veto because she wanted progress and efficient
decision-making. The arguments are just the same for the 1996
Intergovernmental Conference if we want to enlarge to the east.
Mr Budgen produces no evidence for his claim that the British people
are becoming more sceptical about Europe. Of course this is the strategy
of the Euro-sceptics: lack of information equals ignorance and
hostility.
In the very week on which he bases his claims Channel 4 in conjunction
with the New Statesman carried out an exercise in which featured a
three-day debate among a group of 230 people selected as a microcosm of
the British public.
This representative sample were given a wealth of information on
Europe and the time and resources to question experts and politicians on
European issues. Their opinions on a range of European questions were
sought before and after the three days of intensive debate.
This ''deliberative poll'', as it is known, demonstrated that informed
British opinion shifted in favour of greater integration within the
European Union.
Here are some of the results which were broadcast on Sunday night.
Beforehand 36% of the people said they would vote to strengthen the
powers of the European Union; afterwards 50% were in favour, an increase
of 15%. There was an even bigger swing -- 16% -- in informed opinion in
favour of Britain having closer links with the European Union: 50%
before, 66% afterwards. There was a similar 16% increase in those who
thought the British economy would benefit from closer links with Europe.
In winding up the programme Sheena McDonald said that it was very
clear to her that the people of Britain wanted to debate and discuss the
issue of Europe. Although Mr Budgen and his friends might not like it,
the truth is that if the British people are given straightforward
information on Europe they shift in a decidedly pro-European direction.

MY phone rang at noon on Tuesday and a Private Secretary at the
Department of Trade and Industry gave me the fairly extraordinary news
that written questions which I had asked six weeks earlier were to be
answered by means of an oral statement that afternoon by Mr Michael
Heseltine.
That call initiated a hectic few days in which the BMARC affair has
become almost subsidiary to the interrelated fortunes of senior Tory
politicians. Why did Heseltine make the statement? Can Aitken hang on?
Is this another disaster in the making for Major?
All important stuff, particularly at a time when Prime Ministerial
fortunes are at such a low ebb. Over the past few days, there has been a
marked crumbling in support for John Major even among formerly-loyal
Tories, as they contemplated the latest opinion-poll runes.
Major, who went out of his way to sit beside Jonathan Aitken while
Heseltine made his statement, was entitled to his own thoughts. Here was
the man most likely to succeed him contriving an opportunity to give his
own halo an extra polish.
Many Tory MPs believed that Heseltine's purpose in elevating my humble
questions to such exalted status was to provide himself with an
opportunity to declare, none too subtly: ''Here is another disaster area
which had absolutely nothing to do with me, guv.''
But who had it to do with? If we leave Aitken to one side, it was
above all others Baroness Thatcher who bequeathed to the Tories this
byzantine legacy. It was she who determined Britain's role as
conscienceless arms supplier to all and sundry in the late 1980s.
The irony was that as John Major sat there on Tuesday afternoon,
supporting Aitken, the one consolation for him must have been that he
wasn't outside, listening to the same Baroness inserting verbal
stilettos in his back. It was almost, but not quite, possible to feel
sorry for him.
We now have the bizarre situation of a Cabinet Minister, Heseltine,
having set up two inquiries into the illegal arms dealings of a company
in which another Cabinet Minister, Aitken, was a director at the time in
question.
For added piquancy, one of the inquiries -- which could lead to
prosecution of former BMARC directors -- is being conducted by the
Customs and Excise, which is answerable to one of Aitken's
fellow-Ministers at the Treasury. It's certainly all very cosy.
When I think of my own constituent who was suspended for months on end
while the Ministry of Defence Police carried out an investigation in the
allegation that he had misappropriated a few envelopes, I can't help
wondering why Mr Aitken should not be asked to step aside -- without
prejudice -- until these new inquiries are completed. As usual, it is
one law for the mighty and another for the humble.
Aitken decided when this affair blew up a couple of months ago that
attack was the best means of defence. He pulled a sword of truth from
its improbable Beaverbrook scabbard and attacked his accusers in fine
style. Conservative Central Office was given over to him for the
purpose, and he then performed an encore in the House of Commons.
As Heseltine and others have none too subtly pointed out, he now has
to live with these grand statements. Support for him among Tory MPs is
muted and highly conditional. For Mr Aitken, it all depends how much
more there is to come out.
I don't actually accept that Heseltine is quite so blameless as he now
seeks to display himself. He has been at the DTI since 1992 and the
BMARC affair has been just below the boil throughout that period. The
Ministry of Defence Police raided BMARC in 1991 and completed their
inquiries, which gave incontrovertible evidence of illegal arms dealing,
in 1993.
It is inconceivable that the results of their inquiries were not
passed to the DTI and, indeed, Customs and Excise. So why have we had to
wait until now for action to be taken? Why, one might reasonably ask,
was the information available to the Government about BMARC not released
in time for arms-for-Iran, as well as Iraq, to be brought within the
scope of the Scott Inquiry?
The truth is that they have sat on it until Heseltine realised that an
explosion was eventually going to occur. Maybe my questions accelerated
that judgment. I find it impossible to believe, however, that they
raised issues which were new to the DTI. And if that is the case, then
Heseltine is just as culpable as the rest of them for not acting sooner.
But let's, to coin a phrase, go back to basics. Why was there a ban on
arms sales to Iran and Iraq in the first place? It was because this was
a war on a horrific and barbarous scale which the ''international
community'' had decided must not be perpetuated; not least because of
its potential to spread over.
This was the judgment which was reflected in the public face of the
British Government: Sir Geoffrey Howe's statement that ''we should
maintain our consistent refusal to supply any lethal equipment to either
side'' and that we should do nothing which might ''significantly enhance
the capability of either side to prolong or exacerbate the conflict''.
While the British Government postured behind these fine words, they
were also handing out arms export licences like confetti. That is bad
enough. But when the sword of truth is finally liberated, I believe that
it will also point in one other direction -- the personal enrichment of
a few key figures.

A TRIBUTE to 200 years of the Tron Kirk and 10 years of Michael Boyd's
piloting of the Tron Theatre, last night's first instalment of Cabaret
200 added up to a pleasingly diverse selection of music and mirth.
''Celebratory snippets and songs,'' pledged dapper MC Jimmy Chisholm,
introducing a wide cross-section of Tron endeavours.
First was the fearsome Queen Ursula Bust, the Glaswegian sister of
Linda Evangelista who was last seen shaking her strawberry-blonde mane
and conical bosoms in Forbes Masson's Tron panto, Snow White. Mr Masson
having been ruled out by illness, Queen Ursula then took it upon herself
to give double value.
Off came the blonde hair -- and jings, there was Gary Lewis singing
This Is Some Life, some song-and-a-half about everyday Glaswegian
absurdity. Louise Beattie sang a red-hot belter about snow. Employing
surreal logic, Tony Cownie transferred Armageddon to Auchenshuggle. Mr
Chisholm crooned lightly, reprising his role in C P Taylor's Good.
There were quieter, sadder, spookier moments from a cello trio and a
string quartet, playing selections from Craig Armstrong's score for
Macbeth. In a different vein, googly-eyed John Sampson and cheeky Rob
Hanley assaulted Wolfie Mozart with fiddle and whistle during Eine
Kleine Nacht Muzik, Ya Bass.
Phil Kay rounded off with a typically bold attempt at wordless,
joke-free stand-up comedy, inviting us to boo him off -- we couldn't --
and claiming to be able to impersonate different years with his left leg
-- he couldn't. Elaine C Smith, in between singing smokily, summed up
the worth of the Tron and Mr Boyd.
''Michael offers me things that Mary Nesbitt isn't in,'' she said.
Offer your thanks for Nesbitt-free Scottish theatre tonight when Arnold
Brown joins Cabret 200.

THE possible takeover of another British merchant bank by a large
German retail bank is bound to set more then City tongues wagging. There
does seem to be a trend whereby continental financial institutions are
keen to pick up British merchant banks and specialist financial firms.
This has happened when some got into difficulties, as with Societe
General at Strauss Turnbull, the Euro-bond specialist, ING at Barings,
and Swiss Bank Corporation at Warburgs more recently. Earlier moves
include Deutsche Bank's takeover of Morgan Grenfell. Less dramatic, but
still significant, stake-building has occurred, as with St Paul of
Turin's large stake in Hambros. Should we be worried or flattered?
The trend seems an inevitable outcome of the UK membership of the
European Union and the opening of its financial markets to the
disciplines of the single market. It is a trend which is not one way
only and which involves all the financial sectors, as Commerical Union's
huge move into French insurance with last year's purchase of Groupe
Victoire made clear. British merchant banks are particular targets
partly because there are so many of them; but even their continental
equivalents encounter British predators (Lloyds Bank has its own
merchant bank in Frankfurt because it took over an existing German
institution).
If anything this trend will intensify as financial groups seek to
expand beyond the confines of their old national frontiers. It is not a
novel experience in this country, but most of the movement to which we
have been accustomed has been transatlantic. British and American banks
have been hopping the Atlantic in a two-way traffic for the past two
centuries, a process much encouraged by their common language.
Schroders, our most successful merchant bank, is an example of a highly
successful business with as big a presence in the US as at home.
That so much of its top management is German is a reminder of how
linguistic barriers have, meantime, melted for everyone. English has
become the common language of the financial world and thus Americans are
no longer at an automatic advantage here, so that when Warburg's sought
world status by a merger with the American Morgan Stanley, and failed,
there was nothing incongruous about the Swiss moving to take the
American place.
Merchant bankers would like to say that because they have a good
record of imaginative and innovative response to financial challenges
and opportunities they are bound to appeal to bigger, but more staid,
continental predators. The fact is, however, that it is the City of
London itself which is especially appealing, mainly because its
regulatory authorities are as flexible as they are firm -- the European
equivalents are far more hidebound. It may be true that it was two men
of German origin -- Warburg and Strauss (both Jewish immigrants escaping
Hitler, incidentally) -- who invented the Euro-bond, London's greatest
single post-war success, but it is impossible to imagine their
achievement in any other European financial context.
The City has a powerful magnetism in its (mostly) self-regulation and
in a global reach uncommon on the continent, except in Amsterdam. Its
present ascendancy will strengthen further, though those who manage its
affairs, and in particular the Bank of England, must ensure that the
growing effect of the European Union is not allowed to undermine its
distinction and freedom from bureaucratic control.
Of course, were every City bank a complete success fewer would fall to
foreign predation, but that is a given of business life everywhere. And
some institutions can be snatched up because of their successes, as
Morgan Grenfell might have tried to claim, and Hambros would have
claimed when the Italians took their first stake. Warburg's had,
however, run out of self-confidence, Barings' out of luck, and
Kleinwort's, arguably, out of steam.
They all looked inexpensive to their potential buyers because sterling
is weak, and so bound to encourage the acquisition of British assets on
the cheap. That must be one worry. Another is that the Big Daddies
acquiring these British banks do dispose of immense financial power on
their home ground, which might cause some problems for the Bank of
England which has to oversee their operations here. What matters is not
who owns financial institutions but how they behave.

Ross Finlay is impressed at Rover's efforts to take the lead
ALTHOUGH the Rover 400 range will expand steadily, as new models are
fed in between now and early 1996, for the moment the 416SLi is the top
car on offer. It is a curious affair, because the manual transmission
version I have been driving comes with Rover's own K-series engine,
while the automatic is fitted with a similarly sized Honda unit, and the
two cars are like chalk and cheese as far as their power delivery
characteristics are concerned.
There is a clearly confident air about Rover group these days. Under
BMW ownership, Rover people obviously feel more secure, and yet still
independent in design terms, guaranteed enthusiastic management backing.
A recent reorganisation of the public relations department, to put much
more emphasis on getting the Rover message through to export markets in
Europe and farther afield, is another sign of the new forward and
outward-looking attitude.
A brand-new model range always perks up any manufacturing company, and
the latest 400 is right up to date as far as appearance, interior, and
engineering details are concerned. The manual 416SLi costs #14,995,
nudging up against the lower end of the price scale for its big-brother
600. This is a deliberate policy, through which Rover would like to
create a seamless price structure, with one range naturally giving way
to the one above it, and minimal overlapping.
All the 416 models have attractive interiors, with Paisley pattern
materials in either cloth or velour. Equipment levels are quite high,
and by the SLi include twin airbags, all-electric window lifts, a more
ambitious central console with extra wood-effect trim, six-speaker
radio/cassette system and, from the outside, fog lamps integrated with
the front bumper.
The passenger cabin is just about the best presented in the class,
much more like the interior of an executive car than of something firmly
in the medium sector. Similarly, the outward appearance, the result of a
positive styling line as well as of tiny styling tricks, is like that of
a bigger car than the compact five-door the 400 currently is. Four-door
saloons arrive next year.
There is a comfortable driving position facing a neatly designed
fascia, with a convenient instrument and control layout. Seat height
adjustment, well-weighted controls and a clutch-foot rest are all
features of the SLi. The only clumsy element is the passenger's-side
airbag cover, which looks like a hasty afterthought. On the other hand,
unlike many of its rivals, Rover offers steering wheel tilt adjustment
even with a driver's airbag. After my first drive in a 400 I was
unenthusiastic about the amount of rear passenger legroom, but now I
feel that I may have fallen into the trap of considering this car to be
a size above the one it really is. When you compare it with its direct
rivals, passenger and luggage space are very fair for the class.
Peaking at 111bhp, the 1.6-litre engine whisks the SLi to 60mph in a
level ten seconds, gives it strong mid-range performance and tops out
around a test-track 118mph. These are fine figures for the class, and
the fuel consumption returns are also competitive: 55mpg at 56mph, 43 at
75 and 29mpg around town.
Hydraulic engine mounting greatly reduces the effects of a power unit
wobbling around inside the basic structure. Acoustic padding, good door
and window sealing all help to keep noise levels low.
As a performance/economy package the SLi puts up a convincing case for
itself, and there is little criticism when considering the linked
features of handling and ride. This may be first and foremost a smart
and well equipped family five-door, but it is also a quick car from
point to point, with secure handling and a composed ride quality. While
all car design involves far more compromises than people sometimes
admit, Rover has given the 416SLi its best shot in all the departments
which count.

SCOTTISH housing association chiefs will vent their anger about recent
cuts in their funding by Scottish Homes when their annual conference
begins in Perth today.
Mr John Scott, who chairs the Scottish Federation of Housing
Associations, said he was furious that Scottish Homes had imposed the
cuts without any analysis of the possible impact they would have on the
work of associations.
According to the federation, management and maintenance allowances for
renovated property channelled to associations by Scottish Homes have
been reduced by 9% to 12%.
Mr Scott said the federation had argued for several years that there
should be detailed research into the levels of such costs. Scottish
Homes had agreed there was a need for this kind of evidence and it was
''unacceptable '' for these cuts to be imposed in this way. There was a
real chance they would affect the future of some associations and
co-operatives.
However, Scottish Homes chief executive, Mr Peter McKinlay, said that
the comments were ''at best misleading and at worst wilful
misrepresentation of the facts''.
He was extremely saddened that the federation had taken such a stance
when discussions about the proposals were continuing. Scottish Homes
believed its proposals, which would see grant reductions of between 0.3%
and 2.6%, could be achieved without affecting the quality of service.

THE Millennium Commission has been busy hacking and whittling at the
list of 550 projects submitted from across the country. The process can
hardly have been easy and it was always obvious that the majority would
be rejected. Now that the first hurdle has been completed, we can see
that there is, indeed, a good deal of dejection, and perhaps a
disproportionate amount of it in Scotland. This is not what some people
are pleased to call Scots whining, but puzzlement at the relatively
small proportion of Scottish projects which will pass on to the next
round. Nor is it entirely clear that the criteria established to guide
the choices of the Millennium Commission are clear enough to give proper
advice to those seeking to apply, or how the commission members have
sought to hold fast to the guidelines.
The presence on the list of those projects which will go forward to
the next stage of Hampden's extensive plan for modernisation is
undoubtedly heartening. Scottish football should have a national stadium
of quality, and if Hampden's #67m project (around half of which would be
funded by the Millennium Commission if the bid is successful) goes
ahead, the stadium will indeed take Scottish football into the next
millennium. The commission will have been particularly interested in
those parts of the Hampden plan which involve the wider community. A
sports hall for the surrounding area is a good investment, as is the
area proposed for community fund raising and the centre for research and
rehabilitation of all sports injuries. The accent on community is what
should turn a mediocre appeal into a successful one, at least as far as
the commission is concerned. Quite where this leaves some of the other
applications which have been rejected, even if they do include a
substantial community element, is difficult to determine.
A significant example is the application by the Greater Easterhouse
community in Glasgow for a 50% grant towards a #13.5m arts, education,
and leisure centre. If ever a project was community based it is this
one. Greater Easterhouse is not well-endowed with facilities which could
even remotely measure up to the proposed plan and it is hard to deny
that the need is there. To the surprise of many, the Greater Easterhouse
project has been turned down flat and will not progress to the next
stage. It was rejected because it was not technically or financially
viable, by which we must assume that the commission does not believe
that the money for running costs is in place, or stands any chance of
being gathered. This is a hard decision and a difficult one to justify.
With substantial sums of money going to tree planting, the onus is now
on the Millennium Commission to validate its ideas on community
projects.

THE receiver of Ayrshire company James Dickie Forging is confident of
finding a buyer quickly, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Six prospective purchasers have visited the Ayr-based firm since
chartered accountancy firm Moores Rowland was appointed receiver on
Friday. The announcement that the forgings company had gone into
receivership was made yesterday.
James Dickie Forging was the subject of a #600,000 management buy-out
from James Dickie about three years ago. James Dickie itself continues
to trade as a publicly-quoted company.
The appointment of the receiver came after one of two financial
institutions unexpectedly pulled out of a proposed #300,000 refinancing
deal.
About half of James Dickie Forging's 66-strong shopfloor team have
been temporarily laid off but Douglas Jackson, a partner of Moores
Rowland, hopes to bring them back to work as activity picks up.
Seven of the 24 administrative staff have been made redundant.
James Dickie Forging was, to an extent, a victim of its own success.
In the year to end-August, turnover leapt about 50% to #3m.
In order to satisfy increased demand for its products, which include
vehicle and drill parts, James Dickie Forging had to invest heavily in
producing dies for customers. As a result, it ran out of working capital
to finance growing turnover.

MILITANT Councillor Tommy Sheridan was yesterday found guilty of
breach of the peace for pushing through a police cordon during a protest
about tree-felling at the controversial M77 motorway extension.
However, Sheriff Kenneth Forbes told him: ''I find myself in some
difficulty about your sentence.'' The sheriff deferred sentence for
three weeks for a background report on the 31-year-old bachelor.
Sheriff Forbes found Sheridan guilty of the offence in Pollok Park,
Glasgow, on March 22. Sheridan claimed at Glasgow Sheriff Court that he
had been acting in his role as the local district councillor.
He said there was great concern locally about the dangers of the
tree-felling and the effect on the environment.
Sheridan claimed the contractors, Wimpey, were using inexperienced
workers and the public was in danger. He denied trying to push pass
police and refusing to move back.
Police claimed they warned Sheridan to move back and thought his
presence was causing other demonstrators to protest more.

FOREIGN domination of the City of London took another step forward
yesterday when blue-bloodied merchant bank Kleinwort Benson said it is
in takeover talks with Dresdner Bank.
In a brief statement, the two banks said they were in discussions on
the possibility of a recommended cash offer for Kleinwort from Germany's
second biggest bank at around the current market price.
Kleinwort shares fell 5p to 719p by the close to value the bank at
around #960m. However, some bulls hoped for a higher price.
Dresdner has made no secret of its aspirations to develop outside
Germany. It acquired the Thornton unit trust group in 1988 and talked to
Kleinwort in 1992 about a possible merger but is generally regarded as
having devoted most of its energies to building up a banking network in
the former communist German Democratic Republic.
Kleinwort has been seen as being vulnerable since 1990 when it was hit
by a spectacular gamble that failed on a holding of Premier Oil shares
which cost it #34m, #16m of losses on Japanese warrants, and #42m of
loan write-offs which created an overall deficit of #68m.
If the Dresdner talks succeed, it means that in a year when Britain's
premier investment house S G Warburg was taken over by Swiss Bank
Corporation and Barings had to be rescued by Internationale Nederlanden
Groep (ING), three of the top banks will fall into foreign hands leaving
just Schroders as major domestically owned player. Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest bank, owns Morgan Grenfell.
Yesterday securities house Smith New Court said profits had crashed
from #95.2m to #31.2m but increased the dividend total by 1p to 11p.

MICHAEL FRY contemplates the Tories' pondering on ''presentation'' and
Unionist name-tinkering (June 7). Presentation is not the problem, and
those Tories who are calling the shots about constitutional policy are
disastrously wrong.
I'll declare my interest. I reckon I'm a Tories' Tory. A forebear
defeated Lord John Russell for the seat of Bedford by one vote. My
cousins of the present day have served turns as mayor of that town. I
represented an Inner London council ward for eight years and called it a
privilege to serve in marginal territory where rich and poor dwell side
by side. In the end I left, because I could no longer endure the
Ruritanian farce of Lewisham Town Hall.
Those years when I had the chance of helping people, and the patient
example of my country cousins, showed me one thing very plainly. Society
is a living fabric, and people of all conditions have a duty of care
toward each other.
This ethic was the fuel of the Conservative Party during its patrician
history. The modern levelling of social attitudes is still overdue in
its entirety, but the pitiless oppression of the poor thrives like never
before because care and responsibility are not at the centre of policy.
The individual is king, but the less you own the less individual you
are. The country always has, and always will, contain people who need
succour from those who wield great power and wealth. And the
Conservative problem is not one of presentation.
The problem is the radical dereliction of desire to serve the public.
It is said that Labour is copying the Tories too closely. Too right.
Neither has a shred of policy to shelter the destitute, to raise up the
poor, or to give the young any future.
Labour is copying Tory mistakes like incompetent exam cheats. I can
think of a string of policies to help the poor afford fuel and to help
young people find purpose and independence. I shall not spell out those
policies because I want to give some attention to the problem of
government itself.
The Scots and Welsh nations and the English regions need governments,
not just parliaments, with power to decide tax and spending on social
care, education, health, industrial intervention, and economic
infrastructure.
The needs and wishes of people in different parts of Britain are not
uniform. Let real power go to capitals at Stirling, Swansea, Darlington,
Chester, Coventry, King's Lynn, Hastings, Winchester, and Exeter. Let
central government decide defence and global diplomacy, but let
transport strategy be decided by the regions in consortium.
Tories arise! Let us overthrow the insolent folly of our leaders. Only
one force can tear the United Kingdom in sunder. That is the force of
arrogant, monolithic Unionism.

THERE I was on Monday in the Horseshoe Bar: it was the launch of
National Pub Week. There was a whole wheen of boys and girls from one of
Tennants pubs and hotels, The Boswell Hotel, a favoured haunt of mine.
Jings it was grand. You got free halfs and the little ones guzzled
bottles of beer and splendid young ladies in little black skirts and
lacy peenies were jouking about serving sausage rolls and canapes and
half of the licensed trade was there telling you how good their
businesses were. Except they weren't.
Underlying every conversation with any businessmen and women for the
past few years is how bad the recession has actually been for them. But
what these people tell you constantly is not how good the company is.
What they tell you is how good the product is. In this they are not
telling lies if they are decent people, and great gobs of nonsense if
they are accountants.
On Monday I found myself in the company of the Scullions, father and
son, who run a famous bakery in Rutherglen, just outside Glasgow. There
I am sharing a libation with Richard and his son and the both of them
telling me about the pies they deliver to the Horsehoe Bar and other
outlets of Mr Tennants. And do you know he was boasting at that?
Well of course he was because his pies are great. and nothing wrong
with the rest of his products. I have written many times before of
people who make splendid products. Products is my word for today's
sermon. Because I had an argument with a wealthy businessman friend of
mine but the other day. He told me that the business of business was
business. He was rather pleased with the epigram. Being in fact a
trained accountant it was difficult to explain to him that this had come
from one of the worst and most discredited Presidents of the US of A. It
was Cleveland. I think.
It doesn't matter because a quote as thick as that doesn't need a
credit. It could have been Hoover. Come to think of it, it could have
been Thatcher. Her ''There is no such thing as Society'' comes close to
President Warren Hastings' immortal ''Back to normalcy'' slogan. All of
the absurd people quoted above are pure Babbitry. Babbits abounding from
their burrows, the burrows of not much sense, little education, and a
sense of such petit-bourgeois greediness that it would turn your
stomach.
Bear with me, I have not much further to go before I hope to make
myself clear. A letter in yesterday's Herald talked of this subject and
I am not sure what our correspondent meant. He was talking of the
functions of the board of any company. Said it was quite simply to make
money for its owners '' -- even if it was a newspaper''.
The truth is that newspapers don't make money anyway, never have.
Maxwell bankrupted everything to run rather rotten newspapers. Murdoch
is selling his rags at a price everybody but his own industry can
afford. Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook that is, lost fortunes on his
blatts. The difference between the first two and the last one is that
Beaverbrook, slighty mad as he was, and horribly egocentric still tried
to produce a . . . product. A quality one. One he wanted to be proud of.
When Alfred Hitchcock, one of the most successful film directors of
all time, finally croaked at an advanced age it was discovered that he
had a little over $3000 in his bank account. The rest had been spent in
making films. Hitchcock lived exceedingly well no doubt, but he spent
his all in making films. In making a product. He spent his money not for
making money but for making films.
He didn't look for any more profit than it takes to make the next
film. I was talking to Peter Broughan who produced the recent successful
Rob Roy film and who produced Tutti Frutti among many other things.
Peter knows that any of the companies he works with make money to make
more products. The Scullion family who make pies and not pictures are
proud of what they offer to the public.
Doubtless their accountants can tell them many ways out of financial
constraints -- make your pies out of the offal of cows' eyelids, add
sawdust or plaster of Paris, or arsenical compunds to increase the
spice. The accountants can tell you everything about business. It simply
doesn't occur to them that making more money for a company and its
dreadful shareholders will result in being poisoned by pies, eggs,
pictures and, at the end of the day, by newspapers.
I wouldn't know because I don't just do what I do for money. But I'm
thinking of it. So are the accountants and all the time at that.

Gavin Bell, who observed an atomic explosion on Mururoa, reports on
the haunted atmosphere of the Pacific island where France intends to
resume testing its nuclear devices
FROM the air, it looks like a necklace floating improbably on an azure
sea. On closer inspection, it is a bizarre blend of heaven and hell.
Imagine a tropical moon shimmering on a placid lagoon, palm trees
rustling in the trade winds -- and a warren of subterranean caverns
pulsating with the radioactive debris of nuclear explosions. Such is the
paradox of this remote Polynesian island where French scientists have
been detonating warheads, to the chagrin of their Pacific neighbours,
for almost 30 years.
Take a low-lying coral atoll perched on a submerged volcano; transform
it into a giant laboratory for mass destruction; provide all the
facilities of an exclusive holiday resort, and you have Mururoa. It is
simulated apocalypse in an illusory paradise.
The island lies some 650 miles south-east of Tahiti, at the southern
end of what sailors used to call the Dangerous Archipelago -- a maze of
atolls barely breaking the surface of the ocean and surrounded by
treacherous currents and badly-charted reefs. With unwitting irony, the
Polynesians called it Mururoa, which means ''Big Secret''.
Partly wooded and partly barren, it snakes for about 40 miles around a
huge lagoon in the form of a shark's jaws, with one narrow entrance made
hazardous by razor-sharp reefs. In effect, a crown of coral above a
dormant volcano, it rises to only 6ft above the Pacific, which
periodically inundates it with tidal waves.
During a testing season, it accommodates more than 1000 scientists and
technicians, 1500 military personnel and up to 600 Polynesian workers in
a complex of thatched huts and prefabricated cabins surrounded by
modern, air-conditioned offices and recreational facilities.
Neighbouring industrial zones comprising factories, naval dockyards and
maintenance facilities extend for several miles in both directions.
Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion have built a massive wall around
the installations to protect them from Pacific breakers, but they have
brightened its concrete facade with paintings depicting their regimental
history from Africa to Indochina.
Tennis courts, an indoor sports hall and a large soccer stadium with
synthetic turf are all within easy reach of the residential area set
amid palm trees and avenues of hibiscus and bougainvillea. An
illustrated brochure issued to new arrivals lists services ranging from
cinemas and libraries to a photographic club and a flower shop.
A stroll along the Promenade des Anglais, named after the seafront
boulevard in Nice, leads to the terrace of an open-air restaurant,
appropriately called The Blue Lagoon. From there one can watch off-duty
soldiers whizzing across the lagoon on skis, cruising more sedately on
sail-boards, and disappearing into the clear shallows with mask and
snorkel.
The illusion of a tourists' playground is fostered by a slender red
and white tower rising from the middle of the lagoon like a fairground
helter-skelter. In reality, it is a device for lowering bombs and
measuring apparatus into explosion chambers deep in the basaltic rock of
the volcano below.
There is another curious paradox -- in a place devastated by nuclear
blasts, fishing and collecting shells is banned as an environmental
protection measure.
Outsiders can only speculate what effect these cataclysmic bangs have
had beneath the ocean, but the aftermath of an earlier series of
atmospheric tests is there for all to see.
At the western extremities of the atoll, the tangled vegetation gives
way to a tortured landscape of incinerated palms and shattered coral,
battered by huge waves as if nature was trying to wash away the detritus
of man's folly.
At the last military checkpoint before this restricted area there is a
wooden board, where you leave your vehicle identification tag and
collect it when you return, to ensure nobody gets left behind after
dark. It is a sensible precaution; this is a very spooky place.
Known accidents at Mururoa are rare. In 1979, a bomb became jammed
half-way down an explosion pit and the blast triggered a tidal wave
which injured two people. A more insidious threat is posed by cyclones
and by tsunami, huge tidal waves that sweep across the Pacific as a
result of subterranean tremors.
In the early eighties a storm ripped open layers of asphalt covering
radioactive waste from one of the last atmospheric tests in 1975.
Civilian engineers at the time spoke of broken vinyl rubbish bags
spewing old gloves, overalls and other contaminated cast-offs over the
atoll and into the lagoon.
The French Defence Ministry has consistently denied reports that the
atoll is breaking up and sinking under the shock of more than 100
explosions. However, a joint director of the test centre admitted as
long ago as 1984 that Mururoa would be ''unsuitable'' for further use in
20 years' time. He did not specify the technical reasons, but French
defence experts said at the time the atoll could no longer support major
blasts of around 100 kilotons.
Mururoa by moonlight on the eve of a test is a surreal place.
Strolling by the lagoon, enjoying a cool breeze whispering through the
palms, you find it hard to imagine a nuclear bomb ticking away beneath
your feet. It seems absurd. You wonder how intelligent men can tinker
with Armageddon in a place the Creator had clearly designed for poets
and lovers.
I was in a two-storey concrete blockhouse when the bomb went off a
mile away. A closed-circuit television camera at the detonation site
went briefly insane, sending a blurred image of the earth heaving, but
the tremor where we were standing was barely perceptible. I turned to a
French colleague:
''Did the earth move for you?''
''Pas vraiment,'' she replied.
As a climax, it was a bit of a disappointment.
It was, of course, only a fairly small bomb in nuclear terms --
probably barely big enough to incinerate Glasgow. The test site itself,
whence we were conducted an hour later, was just a hole in the ground
leading to a shaft plummeting into the heart of the volcano far below
us. There was nothing much to see, and French military officials assured
us the controlled explosion had posed no threat of contamination. To
prove the point, the then Defence Minister went for a swim in the
lagoon.
Such assurances are regarded with profound scepticism by Bengt
Danielsson, an anthropologist who sailed on Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki
expedition, and an authority on Polynesian culture and history. He
settled in Tahiti in 1953 with his French wife, raised a family, and
infuriated the French authorities with unremitting opposition to their
nuclear testing programme.
The author of Mururoa Mon Amour, and an ally of Greenpeace, Danielsson
was among the first to report lethal fall-out from atmospheric tests
conducted between 1966 and 1974. According to Danielsson, there was an
abnormally high incidence of cancer among natives working at Mururoa,
many of whom were taken to military hospitals in France and brought back
in coffins.
''Scientists from New Zealand recorded radioactive fall-out throughout
the Pacific after the atmospheric tests, but the French denied there was
any in their islands,'' he recalls. ''Are we to believe the particles
acted in a patriotic manner and jumped over French Polynesia to other
islands? The other possibility, of course, is that the French were
lying.''
On a recent return visit to the area, I met a young Tahitian who had
been employed by the Centre d'Experimentation du Pacifique as a
labourer. While diving for pearl shells off Fangataufa, another atoll
used for atmospheric tests, he had seen fissures in the reef wall.
''The coral is wide open and the cracks are very deep,'' he said.
''How can they say nothing bad can come from there? My heart tells me
the tests are bad, but my head tells me a lot of island people with
families to support depend on the CEP for a living. It is not an easy
question.''
The question has now been resolved for the time being, in defiance of
international protests, by France's new right-wing administration. From
September, moonlight on Mururoa will once again be the stuff that dreams
-- and nightmares -- are made of.

The fate of the Fort William sleeper train lies with 11 people. As
Duncan Black reports, the issue is close to home for at least two of the
British Railway Board members
ELEVEN people will shortly decide the lot of the Fort William sleeper
service. They are the members of the British Railways Board which is
meeting in London and is expected to discuss the future of the service
and whether there is to be an appeal to the House of Lords over the
Court of Session's decision that the service should continue pending
public consultation.
The board includes two Scots -- both part-time non-executive
directors.
One is senior industrialist Sir William Francis, whose many years in
the construction and civil engineering sectors included stints as
vice-chairman of Tarmac and a director of Trafalgar House.
His current appointments include a directorship of Mining (Scotland),
which he backed as an investor in its successful bid to buy the bulk of
the coalfield north of the Border when British Coal was privatised.
The other Scot is William Wilson, chairman in Europe of Alexander &amp;
Alexander, the world's second-largest insurance broker. He is also a
non-executive director of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a director of
the Glasgow Royal Infirmary NHS Trust.
Wilson began his career with Stenhouse Holdings in Glasgow and later
worked in Canada and New York. In recent years he has been based in
London, but he has restored an eighteenth-century farmhouse at Braco in
Perthshire as his main home.
Heading the British Railways board is John Welsby, chairman and chief
executive. He is a former director of BR's provincial services and was
managing director of procurement before becoming a board member in 1987.
The vice-chairman, appointed early last year, is Christopher Campbell
whose career has included a number of senior posts with the Debenhams
retail group. He is chairman of British Shipbuilders and a director of
Harrods Bank.
There are two other full-time members of the board. Paul Watkinson,
appointed in October last year with specific responsibility for
personnel policy, joined BR in 1962 as a management trainee. He rose to
divisional manager for Yorkshire and Humberside before joining the BRB
HQ, and has been group personnel director since 1991.
James Jerram was appointed to the board in 1991 and has particular
responsibilities for financial and planning matters. Before joining
British Rail, he was involved with the computer software industry and
held a number of financial management positions. Much of his career has
been spent outside the UK, mainly in other EU countries.
Apart from the two Scots, there are five other part-time non-executive
directors.
They include Peter Allen, former managing director of the British
Steel strip group which included Port Talbot, Llanwern and Ravenscraig.
A qualified metallurgist and chemist, he has worked all his life in the
steel industry. He is also chairman of the West Glamorgan Health
Authority.
Javaid Aziz has spent his career in IBM companies. He has been general
manager, marketing, for IBM UK and board director of IBM UK Holdings
since 1992. He is also chairman of IBM Financial Services.
James Butler, appointed to the BRB early last year, is chairman of the
European Passenger Services company and former senior partner of KPMG
Peat Marwick. His directorships include one with Camelot, the company
which runs the National Lottery.
Kenneth Dixon is deputy chairman of Bass and former chairman of
Rowntree.
Kazimiera Kantor is group finance director of Central Independent
Television. Since joining the BRB in 1987, Kantor has been a member of
the board's investment, audit, and supply committees, and director of
BR's Pension Trustee Co.

IF Kenneth Clarke meant what he said at the Mansion House on Wednesday
evening, he leaves one very large, awkward question unanswered. Can the
Tories claw back a yawning near 40-point deficit in the opinion polls,
soothe the troubled soul of Middle England, and win a fifth term in 1996
or 1997 by following the Chancellor's high-minded agenda?
The key to that agenda, Kenneth Clarke insists, is the promise of
sustainable economic growth, in particular the kind of price stability
Britain has not experienced since the 1960s. Clarke has extended the
Treasury's current target for underlying inflation of 2.5% or less by
the end of this Parliament out into the years beyond the next election.
Today that rate stands at 2.7%.
He has set his face against fiscal fixes. Populist binges are out.
There will be no cynical bribes. No bartering with the electorate. If he
means what he says, Clarke is, in effect, staking his reputation on the
claim that the disaffected will flock back to the Tory Party if it
promises them selfless integrity in managing the economy and shows, by
its deeds, that it can deliver German and Japanese-style low inflation
this year, next year, and for many years to come.
Days after a flurry of media predictions to the contrary, the
Chancellor has effectively quashed all prospect of a U-turn on the
shrinking tax breaks available to mortgaged home-owners. No emergency
fiscal balm is likely to be concocted to ease the hurt negative equity
has inflicted on his party's bedrock support in the south. Clarke's
answer to Distressed of Bradley Stoke is to sidestep Lady Thatcher's
call for a larger subsidy fix for beleaguered home-owners and offer them
a stable economic backdrop against which to nurse their wounds instead.
There will be no general tax cuts, the Chancellor told his City
audience, unless and until public spending is squeezed tighter. If he
really means that, spending departments face an even tougher settlement
this autumn than last and the consequences will be felt by all of us in
what will, inevitably, be the last fiscal year of this Parliament.
In explicitly rejecting a politically motivated dash for growth before
the next election, Kenneth Clarke argues that sound economics makes for
good politics too. Those on his own back benches who have been beating
the tax-cuts drum loudest over the past year, honing their
Euro-scepticism to razor-sharpness, and threatening a direct challenge
to John Major's leadership later this year, will take some convincing
that he is right.
It's not just that the Chancellor -- as the Cabinet's most outspoken
Euro enthusiast -- is, for them, public enemy number one. It's also
that, when the ship is sinking fast, lectures on the optimum operation
of the modern marine diesel engine cut no ice with those about to drown.
They are preoccupied with seeking out more urgent, even desperate,
remedies to preserve their seats.
Intellectually, the Clarke agenda has much to commend it. The British
economy needs a prolonged period of sustainable economic growth, free of
the juddering stops and goes imposed on it by past political cycles.
Permanently low inflation not only protects the value of money, it also
forces more rational economic choices on all of us.
The most disappointing feature of this recovery, compared to its
predecessor in 1980/81, is the weakness of investment. As analysts at
NatWest Securities pointed out the other day, 12 quarters on from the
low point of the 1980/81 recession, investment was up 20.6% and
accounted for 37% of overall growth in gross domestic product. This
time, 12 quarters on from the trough, the comparable figures for
investment were increases of 6.4% and 14% respectively.
The various components of that investment tell differing stories. The
recovery in investment in plant and machinery -- the key to industrial
capacity -- is broadly similar after each recession. Housing investment
is weaker this time than it was in 1980/81. But, comparatively, the
weakest recovery of all this time is investment in other new buildings
and works. That includes public works and investment in new bricks and
mortar by the private sector.
If the Chancellor proves to be as tough on public spending in the next
round as he was hinting this week, that is where the impact will be felt
hardest. A further squeeze is bound to feed through to the very things
Kenneth Clarke claims to cherish -- a modern National Health Service and
high-quality state education. These are the things whose enhancement, on
the Clarke analysis, will give back to the disaffected a growing sense
of security.
But, if he does what he says he'll do, the cuts in school books and
equipment budgets and the cancelling of school capital projects parents
are just beginning to hear about for this year, will be repeated, only
more harshly, in pre-election year. And the cash crises hitting many of
the new health service trusts will deepen next year.
To be fair to the Chancellor, he acknowledges the dangers. At the
Mansion House he argued they can be avoided by looking even more
carefully at priorities; by redoubling the search for value for money;
and by getting the private sector to pay for more of the infrastructure,
through the private finance initiative.
But the PFI is still mired in Whitehall red tape. The drive to
prioritise spending hasn't worked this year. And next year the whole
picture will be muddied by the transition to the new local authorities.
If Kenneth Clarke eventually manages to knock a penny or two or even
three off the standard rate of income tax in return for an even tougher
squeeze on public spending, and that squeeze further erodes the quality
of service the public sees their children and their sick receiving, will
it bring him and his party last-minute joy at the polls?
I doubt it. And my doubts will grow if the southern housing market
shows no signs of revival as the election date nears. There are a lot of
angry people out there who want to punish this Government. Many of them
might agree with the Clarke analysis, in the abstract. But, if some
eleventh-hour tax cuts arrive in the circumstances I've just sketched
out, I cannot see how the public determination to punish will be any
less strong then than it is now.

A SHERIFF has vowed to crack down on drugs offenders after hearing
nine drugs-related cases in one day.
Sheriff James Smith at Kirkcudbright said: ''Normally I get the odd
case coming before me. But when I looked through the cases today there
were up to nine, mainly youngsters. The situation fills me with
horror.''
He fined one youth #300 for being in possession of cannabis resin and
he ordered reports on a woman, who admitted four drugs charges. He added
that he had not ruled out the possibility of a prison sentence in her
case.
He warned that the starting figure for a fine would now be #300
instead of the previous #200 and then went on to fine Simon McLauchlan,
18, The Terrace, Dundrennan, #300 for being in possession of cannabis
resin at the Old Tolbooth Building in Kirkcudbright on Hogmanay.
Later Sheriff Smith deferred sentence for three weeks for reports on
Sarah Jackson, 29, of Jubilee Place, Kirkcudbright, who admitted four
charges of being in possession of cannabis, cannabis resin and
amphetamine on October 5 last year at her home and a further charge of
being in possession of cannabis resin on March 2 this year.
He told Jackson: ''I have to deter this sort of thing. This is a prime
example of how things escalate.
''Sentence is deferred for reports and I am not closing my eyes to any
course. I am not ruling out imprisonment.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair came face to face with his waxwork double
yesterday, and the relaxed but serious pose it struck immediately
brought forth his characteristic broad grin.
Creators of the model at Madame Tussaud's in London had left off the
trademark smile to give the double the look of a serious politician.
As Mr Blair posed with the model for photographers, he joked: ''It's
much better than the original! At least, he's not smiling, anyway.''
Mr Blair donated a pair of shoes for the figure, which will join
models of other party leaders, including John Major, Margaret Thatcher,
Paddy Ashdown, John Smith, and Neil Kinnock, in the Grand Hall at the
world famous waxworks.
Mr Blair's model will stand to the left of Mr Major.
Sculptor Karen Newman, who took more than six months to create the
figure after the Labour leader sat for her last October, admitted: ''He
was a difficult subject because his face is quite changeable.
''We agreed it would be better not to give the figure a grin. I wanted
to portray the serious politician.
''If a subject has to retain a smile for too long it can begin to look
a little strained.''
A Madame Tussaud's spokeswoman said there were no plans to make a
waxwork of Mr Blair's wife Cherie, adding: ''We tend usually not to do
wives unless they are famous in their own right.''

Andrew Wilson reports on growing foreign interest in UK institutions
THERE was almost universal sadness in the City of London yesterday
when Kleinwort Benson admitted that it was in talks with Dresdner Bank
of Germany, which may lead to an offer to acquire one of the last of the
major British investment houses for around #1000m.
At the same time, it is a major compliment to the City that yet
another German bank acknowledges its supremacy over that of Frankfurt in
the battle to dominate the European financial markets and to remain the
pivot between Tokyo and New York.
There are 552 foreign institutions in London regulated by the Bank of
England, ranging from just one for Togo to 53 for both Japan and the US.
The willingness of Germany's second biggest bank to concentrate
firepower in London will add further to the rising total of invisible
earnings through foreign exchange dealings and commissions which
altogether totalled #20.5 billion in 1994.
This latest development is just a another step in the reorganisation
of the European financial sector. It leaves Britain with only one truly
independent merchant bank with substantial capital -- Schroders. That is
effectively family controlled and is probably bid-proof.
A securities house with aspirations to be the new Warburg is the BZW
division of Barclays, but will take three or four more years fully to
find its feet internationally, even if it has about #50 billion of funds
under management.
Then come banks such as Hambros, which was forced to halve its
dividend last week after a profits slump -- a common phenomenon in the
City at present as business remains at a low ebb -- the privately owned
Robert Fleming and Lazards, which is owned by the Pearson media empire.
In a class of its own is the highly secretive 200-year-old
Rothschilds, which has a quarter stake in Smith New Court, which said
yesterday that profits had plunged two thirds to #31m and hinted it
would be interested in talking to a larger partner with deep pockets.
The Kleinwort approach follows hard on the heels of the #860m purchase
of S G Warburg by the Swiss Bank Corporation. That deal effectively
ended any prospects of a UK securities house emerging which would be
able to compete on global terms with the likes of international houses
such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs or Credit Suisse.
The basic requirement is capital, and that Warburg lacked if it
intended building up a fully comprehensive range of financial services
to major clients. Last autumn it was forced to reveal that it was in
talks with US banking house Morgan Stanley. But after a torrid courtship
the two went their separate ways, unable to agree on price, and more
particularly the opposition from the 75% owned Mercury Asset Management
side, which is the largest fund management group in Britain, handling
over #60 billion of pension and other long-term funds.
One advantage as far as Dresdner is concerned is that the Kleinwort
investment management side, which includes a plethora of investment
trusts, is fully owned and so there will not be a problem with dissident
directors able to block the deal.
But the repercussions dealt a mortal blow to Warburg with many key
staff leaving, many to join Morgan Grenfell, as morale crashed and Lord
Cairns resigned as chief executive. So without too much difficulty,
Swiss Bank Corporation was able to persuade Warburg's directors to agree
in principle to a merger to save what was a wasting asset.
The list of the banks and broking houses taken over by foreign groups
is long, and includes some of the best known names in UK finance.
Perhaps the most famous is Morgan Grenfell, which succumbed to the
charms of Deutsche Bank's #950m in 1989.
But undoubtedly the most spectacular was the rescue of Barings by
Internationale Nederlanden Groep of Holland in February, after the
machinations of now the world's most famous financier, Nick Leeson,

<TEXT>
A FATHER jailed for four months for lying to the police over a road
accident failed yesterday in an appeal court bid to be reunited with his
family.
David Whitehead's wife, Patricia, 32, was freed last month, for the
sake of their three young sons, after serving three days of her
two-month sentence for backing up his false story.
But the Court of Appeal in London yesterday refused Whitehead, 47,
leave to appeal, ruling that his prison term was ''entirely justified''.
Whitehead is expected to be released from Winchester Prison in about a
month, after serving half his sentence.
He was not in court for yesterday's hearing. His wife, who was
present, said she was ''obviously unhappy'' about the judgment.
The couple -- respected members of their local community at
Brockenhurst, Hampshire, where he teaches in Sunday school and she leads
a Cub Scout group -- were jailed by Mr Justice Ian Kennedy at Winchester
Crown Court for attempting to pervert the course of justice.
Whitehead, a computer programmer, had told police his wife was driving
the family car when it was in collision with a motorbike last August.
But he was driving and concocted the story, fearing he would lose his
licence and put his job at risk.
His wife, who runs an off-licence, was persuaded to give the same
account.
She was freed on a community service order by the Court of Appeal
solely because of the plight of her children, Alexander, five,
Christian, seven, and Ian, nine. The court stressed that attempting to
pervert justice almost always attracted a custodial sentence.
Whitehead's counsel, Mr Ben Compton, argued that his client had
learned his lesson from the ''clang of the prison gates''.
It was now in the public interest, he said, to allow him to be
reunited with his family and continue his #12,000-a-year job at St
Thomas's Hospital, London.
Whitehead had suffered the deep shame of seeing his wife sent to
prison after he had drawn her into the deception. And his sons had been
the target of massive attention from the media, who ''laid siege'' to
his parents' home on the Isle of Wight while the boys were staying
there.
Lord Justice Hutchison, sitting with Mr Justice Dyson and Mrs Justice
Steel, said they accepted that Whitehead was a man of positively good
character with many virtues.
However, the sentence could not be regarded as ''manifestly
excessive'', given the aggravating features of the case.
Whitehead chose not only to lie to the police but to involve others in
the deception. In addition to suborning his wife, he asked his car
passengers -- his parents, sister and two visiting French students -- to
support his story.

EXCLUSIVE
THE Department of Trade and Industry did lobby its US counterpart to
get contracts to reprocess enriched uranium at Dounreay for more than a
year, despite official assurances to the contrary, it was revealed
yesterday.
Following revelations earlier this week that radioactive particles had
escaped from a shaft at the Dounreay plant, the Scotland Against Nuclear
Dumping group (SAND) claimed the DTI had been lobbying in America.
However a DTI spokeswoman later told The Herald: ''The department has
not been part of any lobbying in America. But it would be entirely open
to Dounreay to make approaches in the US themselves. They wouldn't have
needed any sort of clearance from us.''
The Herald has now obtained a copy of a letter dated May 19, 1994,
from Dr Derek Pooley, chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy
Authority's Government Division to Dr Timothy Walker, head of the atomic
energy division at the DTI.
In it Dr Pooley refers to telephone conversations with Dr Ken Bulmahn
and Mr Alex Murray working on the Environmental Impact Statement which
was required before the US would take back the spent fuel.
Dr Pooley wrote: ''I was somewhat surprised to find out that neither .
. . knew anything about your suggesting to the US DoE (Department of
Energy) that it made sense for the British at Dounreay to deal with
spent European MTR fuel, leaving the Americans to handle fuel where
there was a real proliferation threat.''
Dr Pooley made clear that a year ago the Americans had ''not seriously
considered the Dounreay option at all . . . ''
The same DTI spokeswoman said yesterday: ''It depends what you mean by
lobbying. I wouldn't say that what you have described is lobbying. But I
can not comment on a document you have obtained unofficially.''
Meanwhile, Dounreay yesterday produced notes of a meeting in 1987
which it claimed showed the Government committee investigating childhood
leukemia had been told of the 1977 explosion in its nuclear waste shaft.
Earlier this week two Goverment watchdog bodies published reports
which were highly critical of Dounreay's dumping of nuclear waste in a
200ft shaft between 1958 and 1977 when an explosion forced the plant's
management to seal it.
The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment
(Comare) first visited Dounreay on Tuesday, November 3, 1987 when it was
preparing its Second Report.
In the notes of that day it states that it had requested information
on accidents, both on and off the site, since Dounreay operations began.
According to the notes a Dounreay official ''reported that there were
no major internal incidents involving radioactivity. There had one or
two fires involving sodium and there had been the so-called ''shaft
explosion in 1977. He reported on the beach particles, their composition
and the methods by which they might have been deposited . . . ''
The Atomic Energy Authority's Dounreay spokesman, Mr Ian Shepherd,
said yesterday: ''This demonstrates what we have been saying all along.
We have been back through our records and can find no evidence of any
intention to mislead.''
But Dr Tom Wheldon of the CRC Beatson Laboratories who was on Comare
in 1987 and still is, said that he had been present at the meeting in
question and said last night: ''That was our first ever visit to
Dounreay and we had a day long presentation about all Dounreay's
activities.
''The words shaft explosion may have been delivered, but the concept
certainly was not. It was mentioned in the context of there having been
no major incident involving radioactivity.
''To my recollection it was never linked with the beach particles,
although we weren't interested in them at the time. It was never
presented to us in manner in which it made us think it was important in
relation to contamination.
''The more important point is that later Dounreay let us carry on
believing that the source of the particles on the beach, which we were
by then investigating, was a 1965 spillage down a storm drain, when they
themselves had come to believe that it may have been the shaft.''

HAVING been beamed down to Westminster as MP for Perth and Kinross,
Roseanna Cunningham, perhaps Scotland's best-known Star Trek fan, is
being given the chance to indulge her hobby on Channel 4.
Later this summer the channel reaches the Final Frontier with a
weekend of science-fiction programmes. The three-day event is designed
to unzip the anorak and investigate a genre which landed on earth
precisely 100 years ago with the publication of H G Wells's The Time
Machine.
The series coincides with the arrival in Glasgow of Intersection, the
world's biggest SF convention, which is expected to attract some of the
weirdest enthusiasts known to man. Channel 4 has decided to sponsor the
event and plans to report live from the SECC over the August Bank
Holiday weekend.
Aware that Scotland's newest (and maybe most telegenic) MP is a big
Trekkie, the series' commissioning editor, Stuart Cosgrove, is hoping to
sign Roseanna Cunningham up to take part in a live discussion programme
from Glasgow. We suppose it would be too much to expect that Roseanna
might wear a Lieutenant Uhuru-style outfit. It would, after all,
maintain the tradition of Perth MPs wearing exotic outfits.
Also billed to appear is actor James Doohan (Scottie of ''Beam me up''
fame). Channel 4 also intends to link up with the Science Fiction
Channel in New York which broadcasts a show called Faster Than Light,
which consists of news bulletins from 2145 (or News at Quarter to Ten as
you could call it).
Pass it along
DELEGATION has been elevated to an art form in the upcoming exhibition
at the CCA in Glasgow. It is called Do It and features the work of 12
artists or it doesn't, depending on your point of view as to what
constitutes a work of art.
The deal is that the artists from Germany, France, and the US have
sent instructions to Glasgow for other people to do the work.
Schoolchildren, a jeweller, a doctor, a chef, and gallery visitors will
be involved in committing the art.
Fabrice Hybert has ordained that a doctor be called in to do some
drawings of cubs. Ilya Kabakov has sent instructions for building an 8ft
cube with two ladders for people to climb up and look inside at a
message which will be too small to make out.
Mike Kelley's work of art consists of making a tape-recording inside
the MGM cinema when it is empty. The idea is to capture ''ghost voices''
and the end result will be a sound tape which ''may or may not contain
any sounds''.
Jean-Jacques Rullier has come up with an interesting wheeze called the
chain drawing. A member of the public will make a copy of Rullier's
original drawing. The original is stored away and the second person in
the chain makes a copy of the copy. And so on.
The series of copies will be exhibited in the order in which they were
made. It is the visual arts equivalent of the old story about a
whispered message being passed along the trenches in the First World War
when ''Send reinforcements, we're going to advance'' was transmuted into
''Send three and fourpence, we're going to a dance''.
Sculptor Bertrand Lavier has asked a Glasgow counterpart to recreate
one of his works, based on the information contained in a critic's
review of the piece. We do not know whether it was a good or bad review.
Alison Knowles's work Homage to each red thing is much simpler.
Gallery visitors are asked to bring along red objects to be placed in
squares on the floor. We're prepared to donate our bank statement.
Out of the swim
MORE art, this time inside HM Prison, Barlinnie, featuring the work of
the art class at the education unit. A portrait of a chap in a Rangers'
jersey caught our eye. It is remarkably like Duncan Ferguson, the
footballer who may yet have the opportunity to do a spot of art while
serving his six-month sentence.
The painting is actually a self-portrait by Watty Semple, a
fresh-faced youth. Watty's other painting on show is of a scene at
Henley Regatta based on a short visit there.
This year's regatta is out of the question for Watty who is serving
three years for stealing a bag of money from an ice-cream van.
Let us praise
WE turn to the literary section of the Scottish Protestant View, the
monthly journal of Pastor Jack Glass's Zion Baptist Church. A poem by
Gail Allison, a young member of the congregation, on the subject of the
charismatic Mr Glass has been chosen for publication. We pass on this
extract:
The Pastor is a lovely man
Exalting Jesus in all he can
Reading, praying, listening
teaching,
Praising, fasting, singing,
preaching.
He wants to die and go to
heaven
But when he does, we'll
really miss him.
So will we.
Close to home
EVER notice how some TV adverts seem to go hand-in-hand with the
programmes they are interrupting? There was Secret Asia: The Dying
Rooms, on Channel 4 on Wednesday, a harrowing documentary about the way
Chinese baby girls are killed or left to die because their parents are
rationed to one child and would rather have a boy. How timely that the
commercial break should close with Kenco's ad, featuring Cherie Lunghi
as the coffee heiress being lectured by a pompous executive: ''It broke
your father's heart that he didn't have a son to carry on the
business.''
Box of tricks
THERE appears to be no end to the ability of M Jean-Claude Richard,
the French consul in Scotland, to blag prizes for our Auld Alliance
competition. The latest is a case of wine, a Cru Special de la Vieille
Alliance from France-Ecoss Wines of Edinburgh.
Dennis Pattenden of Killearn provides today's tale of Franco-Scottish
friendship. He was on a family holiday, staying in a block of flats in
the Pyrenees. He set off to explore and his first sight was a very
attractive lady waiting for the lift with a box of groceries at her
feet.
Anxious to cement relations between the two countries, he engaged her
in conversation. When the lift arrived he picked up the box of groceries
and followed her in.
The conversation continued, despite Mr Pattenden being extremely
puffed carrying the heavy box to her car. As he deposited the box on the
ground and pointed to the boot, she said: ''But, monsieur, that is not
my box.''
He humphed the box back into the lift and pushed it out on to the
landing and as the doors closed he spotted a very confused young French
couple who had been looking for their shopping.
His hopes that the episode would remain secret were dashed when his
daughter, a French student, heard the tale the next day from the young
lady.

Strasbourg
GLASGOW'S Labour Euro MP, Mr Bill Miller, yesterday signalled support
for a Tory-produced report which called for action against drug abuse in
the city.
He is to take up the findings of a report by one of his Tory opponents
in the European Parliament with Mr John Major. He will ask what action
he intends taking to tackle unemployment, poverty, and racism, which his
colleague, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, links in his report to drug abuse.
Sir Jack, Euro MP for East Sussex and Kent South, told the Parliament
yesterday there was a need for more drug prevention policies ''which
help to reduce unemployment, poverty, and social exclusion, and
eradicate racism and xenophobia''.
His findings suggested the best form of drug-abuse prevention involved
reducing vulnerability, which in turn helped to reduce unemployment and
poverty.
Sir Jack argued that action of this kind would contribute to ''greater
academic success, better training, better living conditions, greater
stability, and improved dialogue within both society and the family''.
Mr Miller, who is to write to Mr Major asking him to implement Sir
Jack's recommendations, said: ''I welcome Stewart-Clark's report, but I
wonder if his own party will pay any heed to it.''
Mr Miller said that in Glasgow drug dependency was ten times higher in
areas of high unemployment than in the rest of the city.

GOVERNMENT concern about a public outcry over the first separate bills
for domestic sewerage charges next year has resulted in the announcement
of a transitional relief scheme to help Scottish householders.
No new money will be involved, however, and the new public water
authorities will be compensated for the enforced lowering of their
charges by resources which previously went to local authorities.
The Scottish Office has spent #125,000 on printing and distributing
leaflets to all householders, detailing present water and sewerage costs
and future arrangements.
The moves led the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to repeat
its warnings of rocketing charges and its claims that moving the service
out of council control was ''the thin end of the privatisation wedge''.
Cosla's Labour president, Councillor Rosemary McKenna, said: ''We have
to ask ourselves why the Government is taking this decision, as there is
no reason at all why the new water authorities cannot receive assistance
to lighten bills, as local authorities have in the past.''
The amount of help given to the water authorities to reduce the
sewerage charge will be shown on customers' bills next year, and
Ministers clearly hope this will alleviate anger about what many will
see as a new charge.
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch said the object of
the transitional scheme, promised earlier, was to ensure that the change
to the financing of domestic sewerage did not of itself produce any rise
in the aggregate of council tax and water bills between this year and
1996-97.

James Freeman reports on how women are moving up through the police
ranks.
WERE everything else equal, in around 20 or 30 years' time at the
present rates of recruitment, a good quarter of all serving police
officers in Scotland would be women. The obvious conclusion from that is
that the higher ranks would contain a similar proportion of females --
officers with ready access to the top jobs -- including the post of
chief constable. Experience shows, however, that this is unlikely to
happen quickly.
Past and current trends show that the higher up the ranks, the lower
the proportion of female representation. For all the obvious reasons,
but mainly because of family pressures, women drop out of the race for
police rank more frequently than men. There is little doubt that the old
police cultures are changing, although at a different pace in different
places, so the signals for women are increasingly hopeful. The Scottish
Police College at Tulliallan Castle is averaging a 30% intake of women,
although this year it is somewhat higher.
The appointment of Pauline Clare in Lancashire illustrates another
dimension in the argument, in that she joined 30 years ago as a
17-year-old cadet. At that time in police terms, women really were in
the ghetto, sidelined in a special female section with ''female'' duties
and a pay scale only 90% that of male officers for similar rank. Glass
ceilings were the reality.
With the Sex Discrimination Act in 1975 these were swept away --
technically, at least -- but again reality intrudes. With a handful of
exceptions, officers who reach the very top jobs are men with 20-plus
years' experience. There are very few women around in Scotland with that
length of service.
As at last year, seven of the eight chief constables in Scotland had
more than 30 years' service, and the other had between 25 and 30 years.
Six of the deputy chief constables had over 30 years' experience, as had
seven of the assistant chief constables. Three ACCs had served for over
25 years and only one had between 20 and 25 years' service.
At chief superintendent rank, only seven out of 69 men in position had
under 25 years' service, and it was at superintendent rank that female
officers made their first appearance. Two of 147 Scottish
superintendents were female, one having between 20 and 25 years'
experience, the other between 25 and 30 years.
They are easily identifiable as the now-Chief Superintendent Sandra
Hood, Strathclyde Police divisional head at Ayr and Superintendent
Margaret Barr, also a Strathclyde Police officer but seconded to the
Scottish Police College. The most senior female officer in Lothian and
Borders Police is Detective Chief Inspector Jinty Kerr, head of the
force's drug squad.
The general perception is that Chief Superintendent Hood would make it
first to the very top in Scotland if any woman officer is ever going to
do so.
She said yesterday: ''I have never encountered any glass ceilings in
all the departments and operations I have headed up. I earnestly believe
it is all about ability and personality and how people relate to you. In
the three months I have headed this division I have had a tremendous
response from my colleagues and from the community. I focus on policing
issues -- getting the best for the community and the best value for our
resources.
''I believe my track record speaks for itself. I am delighted that
Pauline Clare has been appointed in Lancashire. I am equally confident
that we will have many many more women in the top ranks in Scotland
before long because there are now so many bright, intelligent women in
the service in Scotland. I was given the opportunities and I seized
them. There was never a gender issue.''
Last year, however, 11,884 young people applied to join the Scottish
police, of whom 670 -- 5%, one in 20 -- secured a job. The figures,
compiled by the Chief Inspector Of Constabulary for Scotland, Mr John
Boyd, illustrate that 72.6% were male and 27.4% were female.
But the unpublished figures show that of the original 11,884
applicants, only 23%, or 2738, were women.
''It is not positive discrimination,'' says Mr Boyd, ''only a
reflection of the determination to select the best-qualified people.''
What the inspectorate length of service figures also show is that
while the number of men starting as constables remains more or less
stable as rank progression occurs, there is an ever-quickening attrition
of women as service years increase. The end result is 212 men with
30-years' plus service and only two women.
Mr Boyd adds: ''What is happening is not revolution but evolution. It
is not now important whether an officer is male or female. The
opportunities are available for them to reach their full potential and
that is the way it should be.''

WHAT is Middle England? Is there such a thing? It is a catch phrase
borrowed fairly recently from American politics, not, although it sounds
like it, a quotation from either G K Chesterton or Rudyard Kipling,
those most English of poets, which refers to some vast like-minded group
in society.
''Middle America'' is a well-understood piece of political jargon in
the United States. It has both geographic as well as social and moral
implications.
Geographically, Middle Americans live in the immense states which make
up that country's heartland, socially and morally their standards are
far removed from those of the sophisticates of the East and West coast
states. They are people right across the spectrum of class -- the terms
middle or working class are not relevant -- who still cling in theory to
pioneer values and are inherently suspicious of change. America's
politicians know what is meant by the phrase and what they must do to
avoid upsetting such a vital constituency within their electorate.
But in Britain, where there has long been a political left and right,
and the twain were highly unlikely to meet on common ground, except
possibly in time of war or national emergency, it was not until the
Social Democrats came on the scene that there was perceived to be a
quite distinct middle way which could be followed.
The tradition was that right went down one road, the left down
another, and they went in opposite directions. Now, with the SDP
defunct, the two major parties are almost going down a two-lane highway
with the Liberal Democrats teetering on the hard shoulder in between,
and it is this new alignment which Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth
Clarke was recognising on Wednesday in his Mansion House speech.
If anything demonstrates the existence of a Middle England it is that
David Owen, one of the Gang of Four who formed the SDP, could have
served in John Major's Government, had he so chosen, and, while it will
not happen, would be equally at home in the Labour Party headed by Tony
Blair. Owen is both political fish and fowl.
The Chancellor's decision to make such a naked appeal to this
perceived Middle England constituency in the electorate is highly
intriguing. The speech's prime purpose was to reassure the City on
inflation, and pacify his own nervous and divided party in Parliament
about tax cuts. But that Middle England reference was aimed beyond
either. Maybe those who have of late been selling shares in Clarke as a
future Prime Minister should think again. He may not be the next Tory
leader, but that is another matter.
Lady Thatcher is currently arguing that the Conservatives' problems
stem from the fact that the Government is not being Conservative enough,
ignoring the fact that the opinion polls say the opposite. Tony Blair
meanwhile stands accused of stealing Tory clothes in his bid to make
Labour electable. Good reason to steal them back, one might think, which
is what both Mr Clarke and the Prime Minister appear to be trying to do.
The two major parties have moved closer together so that the
Conservative left is, at times, difficult to distinguish on a whole
range of issues from the Labour right. The horny-handed sons of toil on
the one hand have gone, as have the landed gents from the shires on the
other.
The result is that Tory voters, who have been deserting at
by-elections and local elections in droves, are now being wooed with
what Mr Major described yesterday in the Daily Express as ''a
reassurance package''. The Chancellor, backing up this strategy, said he
had been insisting for the last two years that Middle England's security
was ''one of the major political issues of our time'', that Middle
England's security had become rather a fashionable theme.
The conclusion he drew was that people looked to governments as a
source of stability, not as a cause for further dispruption in their
lives. One of John Major's greatest achievements had been to put in
place policies which could deliver this stability, he added. That may
well be true, but, if it is, the message has not got across to the
voters.
Tony Blair's achievement, built on foundations laid by his
predecessors, Neil Kinnock and John Smith, has been to destroy the old
Labour image which was that a Labour Government offered revolutionary
change, instability not stability.
John Major's problem has been that, faced with a divided parliamentary
party, he has had to ride several horses at the same time, to give a
little ground here to save a little ground there. While responsibility
for the ills of the share-owning, house-owning, upwardly mobile,
negative-equity plagued society created by his predecessor may lie at
her door, he has not managed to convince the patient that he can
provide, let alone knows, the cures.
That is what Mr Clarke was up to. Here he stands. Safe hands, honest
Ken, man of the people, steady as he goes, no boom, no bust, nothing to
do with Thatcherism, everything to do with tomorrow. His message is
aimed at the council estates where people now own their homes, at the
people who sent shivers through the City when they turned up at the
British Gas annual meeting -- the revolt of the Sids, so to speak -- at
all those who do not feel good, every bit as much as it is directed at
the affluent suburbs, the prep-school parents, and the county nobs.
Middle England is an English political phenomenon. Talk of Middle
Scotland and the phrase ceases to have any meaning because Scottish
politics are not made up of the same ingredients and any appeal to the
Scottish electorate -- because the Tory losses in Scotland over the past
20 years make anything that is occurring in England seem small beer --
has to be couched in different language.
But Scotland, while it is a vital factor in electing any Labour
Government, will not re-elect a Conservative Government. It matters that
Middle England be made to feel good and that speech is part of the
process of trying to bring that about.

Middle England revisited: Anne Simpson reports on why it has been lost
to the Tories.
DEEP in the troubled heart of England it requires more than the
dangling of a raw carrot to restore the equilibrium. Among many of the
Tory faithful there is a feeling now that mediocrity is unimprovable. Mr
Major's Government has had three years to prove otherwise, and its
careless failure to do so mocks people's trust.
But where is the heart of England? Anywhere outside London that
resents the centralist's bullying push. Earlier this year I embarked on
a journalistic tour around the country, listening to the voice of
England, from the rich pastoral bliss of Essex to the battered verities
of the North. In every random instance that voice was one of
disaffection, loud and irritable in its contempt for Tory stewardship,
and sometimes a voice at the end of its tether.
So is this sudden wooing of the middle ground by the Prime Minister
and his Chancellor likely to quiet the anger, replacing fear with hope?
Mr Major's ''reassurance package'' could include a cutting of
inheritance taxes and a relaxation of the rules whereby the sale of
citizens' homes is used for nursing care. Mr Clarke's proposals hint at
an emergency deal to help property owners and encourage job security.
But yesterday the consensus among some of those I had met on that
English journey five months ago had not remotely changed. If anything,
the Chancellor's insistence that it will take time for the benefits of
his fiscal prudence to feed through to ordinary people seemed more of an
insult than ever, and the feeling was that people would not be fobbed
off by such patronising talk any longer.
In Derby Richard Felix, the city's best-known tourist entrepreneur,
spoke for several small businessmen when he reflected: ''Whatever they
promise us now, my disillusionment with the Tories will remain total. I
talk as someone who once would have voted for a donkey if it had worn a
blue ribbon but under this Government people like me have suffered
enormously. I'd like to say that present Conservatism didn't create the
recession but I really don't know what else has.''
It isn't just economic hardship that has destroyed the faith of Felix
and his like. ''In fact they've plunged us back into Dickensian times
with slave wages but without Victorian values. I think the continuing
sleaze shenanigans are shameful, especially when there is no job
security for ordinary folk. But it's also appalling that crime seems out
of control, that hospitals are threatened, and the education system is
in ruins. In Derby, with practically no traditional industries left,
tourism is the only way forward, but just now we're hurting more than
ever.''
Such is Felix's distaste for politicians altogether that he will not
endorse anyone in the next General Election. In deepest Essex, within
the unspoiled Tudor village of Steeple Bumpstead, Stanley Drapkin, local
historian, chairman of the parish council, and moderating sage,
confirmed the grassroots' view that the latest Major-Clarke
pronouncements had come too late.
''This business of picking something here and picking something there
leaves people with the feeling of panic action rather than orderly, good
government. Meanwhile the burning issue for so many remains unaddressed.
This crisis in education strikes at the centre of everybody's anxiety
here, not just the well-to-do. It's no good saying economies must be
made. There is a great and urgent need for new money to be pumped in,
particularly to primary education, those founding years in children's
lives.
''At least, though, we now have a Secretary of State who is listening,
but will Gillian Shephard be supported by the Treasury? I doubt it. Yet
until the Government pledges itself to reducing class sizes and ensuring
the means for quality teaching, its credibility will count for
nothing.''
In the North-east of England the issue of regional assemblies -- the
right of elected local leaders to have more say in their region's
affairs -- is also one which unites the chattering classes and the
workers. Consequently Tory politicians, along with clog-dancers and
drystone-dykers, are a vanishing species. Will this week's ministerial
pledges provide resuscitation for the first?
At Northumbria University, Howard Elcock, professor of government,
could not detect any significant concession in what had been said. For
him the aspirations expressed by John Major and Kenneth Clarke clashed
with present Tory ideology. The NHS and education are issues causing
outrage and every Conservative politician knows this, he observed. But
the reason these services were in such a mess was precisely because of
Tory policies.
As for English devolution, well, the North-east will not attain that
unless the Government is trounced at the ballot-box. But is Labour now
retreating from its proposal for English assemblies? Howard Elcock does
not believe so: ''My soundings still indicate that there is strong
support among Labour politicians in this region. All of them are soundly
behind the plan, and I personally believe it would work even without
other regions adopting the strategy. Certainly nothing that's been said
by the Conservatives this week removes the widespread feeling here that
this Government has not been sympathetic to our disastrous industrial
decline.''
Among post-war generations in England the belief that owning property
meant concrete self-advancement was a faith adhered to more devoutly
than religion itself. But until Mr Clarke can put proof back into
people's pockets that home ownership does offer financial security it
will still seem as if the boot of the heretic has triumphed.
The wretched reduction in property prices, the personal tragedies of
mortgage failure, the loss of confidence in secure employment, the
knowledge that poor education is a curse upon our children, the belief
that vandalism is out of control, that the Provinces have no clout, that
an unaccountable elite now gorges on obscene rewards . . . these remain
the preoccupations at the heart of England, igniting a fury all the more
complex and unforgiving because it exists in the promised land of
long-term Tory rule.

THE Herald and its sister paper the Evening Times become the first
Scottish daily newspapers to go live on the Internet today, allowing
samples of the papers' contents to be downloaded electronically by
readers around the world.
Today's taster comes before the official launch on July 1, when live
editorial -- updated weekly -- plus daily news flashes will be available
to computer users who are connected to the Internet.
The Herald's editor, Mr George McKechnie, said there was a strong
demand from expatriate Scots for the distinctive view which the paper
provided. ''By making a selection of articles available electronically
we can serve that market very effectively,'' he added.
Caledonian Publishing, owners of both titles, plans to be a Scottish
market leader in what it sees as a greatly expanding section of the
on-line information business.

EXTRA health checks may cut the cancer death toll in women, according
to new research out today.
The Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) is asking the Department of
Health to back a large-scale trial on women already in the
cervical-cancer screening programme in the hope that it could save
500-1000 lives each year.
Dr Jack Cuzick, head of the ICRF's research department said: ''The
current screening programme has been highly effective in preventing
thousands of cancers. But since take-up now exceeds 80%, new tests are
needed if we are to make further improvements.''
He said researchers had looked into the effect of adding a test for
human papillomaviruses (HPV) to the pap smear and found high-grade
abnormalities not picked up by the existing test.
The usual smear test missed four out of 10 women with cancerous cells.
However the extra HPV test also missed 25% of abnormalities.
The initial research, published in the Lancet, involved nearly 2000
women, mainly under 45, with no previous treatment for abnormality and
no abnormal smear in the past three years.
The cervical screening programme is estimated to cost #120m a year.
Just over 80% of women aged 20-64 have had a smear in the last five
years. Testing is thought to have caused a significant fall in
cervical-cancer deaths.

EXAMPLES of Fanny Cradock's caustic cookery wit were seen in a sale
yesterday of books, recipes and other items from her kitchen.
The auction, at Phillips in London, raised #2553 -- and more than a
few laughs. Many offerings included humorous notes penned by the
vituperative TV chef, who did not always agree with other people's
cooking methods.
A recipe for stuffed trout which suggested the fish should be
three-quarters full before cooking was ringed with ''Fill it, clot''.
Another recipe instruction, that chopped parsley should be used for a
garnish, was embellished: ''Heads, dearie'', and over a suggestion that
a mixing bowl should be warmed before use was the note: ''Only for
washing up, chum!''
Other recipes were written off with the words: ''fiddle-faddle'',
''merde alors'', ''simply lunatic'' or ''hopeless''. Referring to an
American recipe, Fanny wrote: ''Not America, the master ruiners of
food.''
The strongest comment was reserved for a suggestion that virgin olive
oil should be used in one recipe. Scrawled in the margin were the words:
''The only virgins in France are little girls and mostly very little
girls indeed anyway.''
Fanny Cradock was as famous for constantly berating her long-suffering
husband, Johnnie, as for her idiosyncratic cookery demonstrations on
their weekly TV programme broadcast in the 1950s and 60s.
The top-selling lot in the auction was a cheese dish and cover which
graced Fanny's kitchen for many years and fetched #345.
The book, Cookery of Provincial France, by M K Fisher, which contained
the observations on French virgins, sold for #287.50, against an
estimate of #150.
Most of the items went to fans of Fanny and Johnnie, including a set
of five cookery diplomas bought for #195 by a woman who lived near the
couple. ''I wanted something to remember them by and I thought the
diplomas were rather colourful,'' she said.
Fanny Cradock died in an East Sussex nursing home last December, aged
85.

Jerusalem, Thursday
IRISH pop star Sinead O'Connor attacked two Israeli photographers near
a church in Jerusalem's walled Old City today, damaging their cameras
and tearing one man's shirt.
A Reuters camera crew filmed a visibly angry O'Connor leaving the Holy
Sepulchre church, traditional site of Jesus's crucifixion, as she
grabbed local newspaper photographer Noam Sharon and demanded: ''How
dare you follow me around the church?''
The singer then tussled with photographer David Mizrahi before
bodyguards hustled her, barefoot and holding a plastic bag over her
head, to a waiting van.
Mizrahi and Sharon said O'Connor broke their cameras. O'Connor is
known for temperamental and provocative outbursts. While on tour in the
United States some time ago she came under censure after publicly
tearing a picture of the Pope.--Reuter.

THE most ambitious project seeking commission funds is a national
cycle network offering 5000 miles of traffic-free walkways and cycle
paths.
It would be within two miles' access of 20 million people, more than
one third of the population, and would cost #172m.
Others with UK-wide appeal, down for detailed appraisal, include a
programme of church floodlighting and plans for ''flagship'' village
halls in deprived urban areas.
High-cost proposals south of the Border include a #113m redevelopment
of Portsmouth and Gosport harbour, a #65m Bristol waterside development,
and a #111m Birmingham hi-tech campus.
London has been shortlisted for a #106m gallery for the Tate on the
site of Bankside power station, a #60m square within the British Museum,
and a #47m Millennium seed bank at Kew Gardens.
Belfast has proposed #12.5m worth of landscape improvements. Wales
wants a #110m Millennium stadium -- a redevelopment of Cardiff Arms
Park. Cardiff also has hopes for an #86m opera house.
Among projects sent back for ''refining'' are a #27m Millennium
sundial for London, a #40m National Space Science Centre for the East
Midlands, a #33m oceanarium for Southampton, #148m plan to ''remake''
the heart of Sheffield, and Edinburgh's #111m ''Dynamic City'' scheme.

THREE air cadets escaped serious injury when a stolen bus crashed
through metal railings, across gardens and into the side of their timber
ATC hut while they were on parade last night.
One boy, 13-year-old Mark Gill, of Heather Road, Hardgate, Clydebank,
was trapped under the bus but suffered only an elbow injury. He was
released from the wreckage by a former cadet with fire brigade training.
Two other cadets, Richard Hamilton, 16, and Lesa Wotherspoon, 14, both
from Glenkirk Drive, Drumchapel, were released from hospital after
treatment for shock and slight injuries.
Squadron Leader George Campbell said: ''My first reaction was that I
couldn't care less whether this place fell down -- the fact that the
cadets were not seriously injured is the priority.''
Last night Strathclyde police said that a 33-year-old man was in
custody in connection with the incident and is expected to appear at
Dumbarton Sheriff Court today.
Mr Thomas McColl, whose brother William runs McColl's Coaches, said
that one of their single-decker coaches had been stolen from their
garage behind the ATC hut in Beardmore Street, Dalmuir, which has been
home to 1740 (Clydebank) Squadron Air Training Corps for 25 years.
Shortly after 8pm, said Squadron Leader Campbell, the bus came round
the corner and crashed into the corner of the hut.
At the time, 28 cadets and five members of staff had just completed
parade and had started ''leadership exercises''.
''Three cadets were standing on the corner when this bus came round
the corner, and traversed right through the end of the building. One
cadet was trapped under the bus, pinned down by part of the fencing,''
he said.
He added that by sheer good luck a former cadet with the squadron,
David Reid, 25, from Faifley, now serving in the RAF's fire service, was
visiting his former colleagues.
''David Reid took the decision that they could get him out, using his
experience of first aid and the fire service,'' he said.
Squadron Leader Campbell said that the trapped boy, Mark Gill, had
been in the squadron for only a month. The other two injured cadets were
also recent recruits.

<TEXT>
FORMER Rangers and Scotland footballer ''Sandy'' Jardine yesterday
told a drugs trial of his shock the night police raided his home.
Mr Jardine, 46, of Orchardhead Road, Edinburgh, was giving evidence in
the High Court in edinburgh at the trial of his son Mr Steven Jardine,
22, who has denied drugs charges.
On trial with Steven Jardine are Mr Calum Slythe, 29, described as a
prisoner, and Mr Kevin Peters, 24, of Restalrig Road South, Edinburgh.
All three deny being concerned in the supply of cannabis, and
possessing cannabis with intent to supply it at various addresses in
Edinburgh and elsewhere in Scotland. They also deny growing cannabis in
a flat at Dalgety Avenue, Edinburgh, between July 1994 and February
1995.
The former international player now a commercial manager, who gave his
name as William Pullar Jardine, told the court he was alone at his house
in Orchardhead Road on February 16 this year having a meal about 6pm
when police arrived with a search warrant.
The police then proceeded to search all the rooms, he said, including
his son Steven's bedroom, taking away a plant and small pieces of what
they described as ''substances'' and a pile of documents relating to his
son's roofing business.
Mr Jardine told the court: ''They searched Steven's room which he
occupied since he was a child. Police took files and paperwork from his
room and also a small plant which I had not seen before. They said it
was resin. I had not seen it before.''.
He said the police arrival at his home was the first time he knew that
his son was ''in difficulties'' with the law.
''The search was not like police raids you see on television, pulling
things out of drawers, etc, etc. They seemed to know what they were
looking for,'' said Mr Jardine.
He said Steven lived with his family and had started up his own
roofing business, which he and his wife had contributed #3000 towards to
get it off the ground.
He added that Steven had been a good son and contributed towards the
housekeeping when he had a successful week in business.
Asked by defence counsel Mr Neil Murray, QC, if he ever had worries in
the past about his son, Mr Jardine replied: ''I have a daughter as well.
You are always anxious about your children and you try to do your best
for them because you do not want them to get into trouble.''
Mr Jardine said Steven had not been any problem to his family. ''He
has always tried to work.''
He told the court that he had no knowledge of Steven being involved in
or renting a flat at Dalgety Avenue, Edinburgh.
Earlier the court heard how police found a ''tropical nursery'' of
cannabis plants growing under special electric lighting at the
top-storey flat. There were rows and rows of the cannabis plants in the
living room and bedroom.
The trial before Lord Kirkwood continues.

Los Angeles, Thursday
IT WAS an indelicate question. Still, everyone wanted to know: call it
perverse curiosity.
''Do we have sex?'' Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson blurted out as hesitant
interviewer Diane Sawyer edged up to the question. ''Yes! Yes! Yes!''
In a live interview on ABC television, Michael Jackson and his wife
said they shared the same house and bedroom, denied child molestation
allegations against Jackson, and discussed their courtship and marriage.
''Why wouldn't we have a lot in common?'' said the 27-year-old
daughter of Elvis Presley.
''Like we're faking this?'' added Jackson, 36.
''How can you fake this 24 hours a day -- sleeping with somebody,
waking up with somebody?'' his wife said. ''I'm not going to marry
somebody for any reason other than the fact that I fall in love with
them. Period. Period.''
If she's pregnant, though, they're not saying.
''We will be expecting a child now when . . . '' Presley-Jackson
started to say, only to be interrupted by her husband.
''We're not going to say when,'' he said. ''Of course it's in the
hands of the heavens.''
It was the couple's first interview since exchanging vows in a secret
marriage in the Dominican Republic in May last year. It was planned to
coincide with the debut of Jackson's new album, HIStory.
They said they dated for four months before Jackson proposed to
Presley over the telephone. An amateur video of their civil ceremony in
the Dominican Republic showed the couple exchanging vows.
Jackson said he was never suicidal while under investigation for child
molestation allegations and undergoing treatment for an addiction to
pain killers.
The 13-month investigation began in August 1993 when a 13-year-old boy
claimed Jackson had sex with him. It ended after Jackson reached a
reported #10m out-of-court settlement with the boy.
Sawyer asked about books with pictures of nude children that were
taken from his ranch. Jackson said he never knew of any in his
possession, but that they could have been sent to him in fan mail.
Jackson repeatedly denied the charges in the interview, and said he
settled the case -- for terms he would not disclose -- to end the
nightmare of publicity that his life had become.
''Never ever, I could never . . . The whole thing was a lie,'' he said
when asked about the charges. ''I was outraged, totally outraged, so
what I said is that I have to do something to get from out of this
nightmare.''
Jackson said he wanted to live abroad, perhaps in South Africa or
Switzerland. He said he would not sell his Neverland ranch in
California, but added: ''I don't care to stay in America any
more.''--AP/Reuter.

Sarajevo, Thursday
THE United Nations was racing today to ward off a Bosnian government
assault which could cause massive casualties and make the UN mission in
Bosnia almost impossible.
''We have received reports from Sarajevo . . . indicating that
Bosnians are preparing a counter-offensive,'' UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali told French Television.
''An effort is under way on the spot. Negotiators are at this moment
in Sarajevo. They are trying to convince the protagonists to prevent a
confrontation,'' he said in the live interview from New York.
The UN reported 2000 shells falling in the areas north of Sarajevo
where the Bosnian government had massed some 15,000 troops for what is
seen as probable a bid to end the three-year-old Bosnian Serb siege of
the city.
''I hope (a counter-offensive) will not take place as it risks
aggravating the situation and make the UN mission even more difficult,''
said Boutros-Ghali.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said his army had taken action
around Sarajevo after the United Nations failed to prevent Serb
strangulation of the city.
''The world has been doing nothing to prevent an obvious
catastrophe,'' said a statement in Izetbegovic's name issued by his
office and read on government radio this evening.
''Under these circumstances our army was ordered to act to prevent the
further strangulation of the city and measures of a preventive nature
are under way.''
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who had warned such an attack
would be disastrous for Sarajevo, described the government offensive as
a ''last-ditch attempt to change the situation on the ground''.
''This is a grave moment for the United Nations which will face a
fresh bloody confrontation,'' Boutros-Ghali said.
Apart from massive casualties, a major conflagration around Sarajevo
was bound to freeze the UN operation, already severely hampered after
Serbs halted relief flights into the city and blocked aid convoys on
which hundreds of thousands of civilians depend for survival.
Their action prompted an angry letter by UN special envoy Yasushi
Akashi and High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata to Karadzic
demanding free passage for aid convoys.
Sarajevo has been surrounded by Bosnian Serb troops since April 1992.
Serb forces cut water, electricity and gas supplies into the city.
The United Nations fears that hard-pressed Serbs might shell Sarajevo
again, provoking another showdown with Nato at the expense of
lightly-armed peacekeepers, and that the remaining peacekeepers held
hostage might be used as human shields against the Bosnian government
advance.
In Washington the new European Union peace envoy Carl Bildt gave a
gloomy assessment of the chances of fresh diplomatic initiatives ending
the Bosnia conflict.
''At the moment there isn't a political process . . . At the moment
we're heading towards war.''--Reuter

COMMUNITY leaders in Glasgow last night told the nine-strong
Millennium Commission responsible for distributing millions of pounds of
National Lottery funds for projects to mark the year 2000: ''You have
blown it.''
They were furious an application for 50% funding towards a #13.5m
multi-use arts, education, and leisure centre in Greater Easterhouse did
not even make a runner-up place, let alone the shortlist of projects in
with a chance of funding.
Project leader Mrs Ina Taggart said: ''This news is a real kick in the
teeth. If the millennium means anything, it means addressing the need
for community facilities in places like Greater Easterhouse. We are
disgusted at not to be going forward to the next stage.''
Edinburgh District Council -- whose bid for about #50m towards its
#111m ''Dynamic City'' scheme was turned down -- also questioned
criteria used by the commission to whittle down Scottish applications
from 82 to 14 that will go forward for detailed appraisal.
Council leader Lesley Hinds -- who noted that not one Edinburgh
application was approved -- said the public had a right to know and
understand how the decisions were reached. Even those on the shortlist
are wondering just how much -- if anything -- they will receive.
The commission yesterday placed only 83 out of 550 UK projects on the
shortlist. But the applicants want #850m in grants -- and the Millennium
Commission has just #350m to give away this year.
Clearly not all 83 will receive funds when the final decisions are
reached in late July or early August, with the money distributed from
September.
The British Waterways Board in particular could not hide its
disappointment that an application for #50m towards the cost of linking
the Union and Forth and Clyde canals was turned down.
If the money is not forthcoming in a future round of lottery payouts,
the ambitious plan for a corridor from Bowling on the Clyde to the Forth
at Grangemouth, and between Glasgow and Edinburgh, is likely to be
scaled down. Certainly, the timescale will now have to be put back.
However, Waterways officials were at least encouraged by a B placing,
which means the project could -- with further work -- be shortlisted at
a later date.
Project manager Mr Jim Stirling said a meeting with the commission to
clarify issues would be sought so that the ''social, economic, and
environmental benefits'' of the #100m canal scheme could be realised.
He said: ''We cannot hide our disappointment and I am surprised as
well. But we will redouble efforts. The project may take a different
form and the timescale may be changed but we want to achieve our aims.''
London-based Waterways executive director Mr Tim Noble said the canal
links could still be achieved by the year 2000. Chairman Mr Bernard
Henderson insisted a ''winning bid'' would be submitted after a
stock-taking exercise.
Glasgow District Council -- which lodged 12 unsuccessful bids -- said
only that it was disappointed and would take time to evaluate the
reasons for failure. It was a diplomatic response because of several B
listing places which at least offer the chance to try again later in the
year.
The council has three projects on the B list -- the #70m Glasgow Green
regeneration, Cathkin Braes country park, and Garscadden Burn park.
Those that failed included projects for Kelvingrove Park, Tollcross,
Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Botanic Gardens, and the Greater
Easterhouse plan.
However, Mrs Taggart, convener of the Greater Easterhouse project,
said bluntly that the Millennium Commission had ''failed the
community''. She went on: ''We worked hard, consulted everybody . . . in
preparing a bid we felt matched all the criteria laid out by the
commission.
''They said community support was a key priority. On that basis, we
should have been top of the list. The commission clearly does not
understand the meaning of community.''
Numerous Highland projects lost out, including the ''Gateway'' plan
for a #20m visitor centre at Oban, a Gaelic study centre on Skye, and
the Highlands and Islands University project.
The #60m Field of Dreams project at Hampden Park, and Glasgow
Development Agency's application for a #90m redevelopment of the 47-acre
Glasgow Garden Festival site at Pacific Quay, were put on the shortlist.
The GDA plan includes a national science centre, 100ft millennium
tower, business park, planetarium, hotel, restaurants, and bridge across
the Clyde.
GDA chief executive Mr Stuart Gulliver said: ''We are delighted. We
believe it is a project genuinely worthy of the millennium. Obviously,
this is an important step. However, there is still a great deal of work
to be done.''
Rival bidder for the Pacific Quay site, Clyde Festival Gardens 1999
Ltd, denied its own project was now a dead duck after its bid for #50m
was turned down.

Washington, Thursday
THE Pentagon today confirmed that a mutiny apparently involving units
of Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard took place near Baghdad
yesterday, but appeared to have been quashed by loyal units.
''The mutiny apparently involved tanks from the Republican Guard and
it was apparently put down by other Republican Guard units,'' said US
Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon.
''I wouldn't want to go too far on this, but it certainly appears that
Saddam Hussein is facing increasing pressure from groups that have been
loyal to him in the past,'' he added. It was the first official US
confirmation that a military skirmish had occurred.
''We believe that the rebellion was led by members of the Dulaimi
tribe, which is one of the major Sunni tribes of Iraq and a group that
has traditionally been a strong supporter of Saddam Hussein,'' he added.
Earlier, Iraqi Shi'ite opposition in exile said that the leader of the
mutiny had died in battle and his forces had withdrawn from the
outskirts of Baghdad.
They said the rebellion continued in the Fallouja and Ramadi areas,
where local people had seized weapons from government arsenals and
joined in.
The Iraqi Government has denied any clash, terming it ''wishful
thinking'' or ''biased propaganda'' by its opposition abroad.--Reuter.

Moscow, Thursday
GUNMEN holding hundreds of hostages in the southern Russian town of
Budennovsk have killed five of their prisoners, according to a radio
report from the site.
Shamil Basayev, a top Chechen military commander who apparently heads
the gunmen, told a news conference in Budennovsk that the hostages had
been killed because Russian authorities were initially reluctant to
allow the gunmen to meet the press, as they demanded.
The radio correspondent said journalists who had attended Basayev's
press conference in a Budennovsk hospital saw at least 2000 hostages
there.
Basayev, right-hand man of Chechen rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, also
told reporters that he had no intention of releasing the hostages -- who
include women, children, and hospital patients -- until his main demands
were met.
The demands include an end to Russian military operations in Chechnya
and the withdrawal of Russian troops from the breakaway territory.
Russian authorities are unlikely to meet the demands. They appeared to
be making little progress in their attempts to negotiate with the
gunmen.
Dudayev has insisted his forces had no connection with the attack on
Budennovsk, which is 50 miles from the Chechen border.
A Dudayev aide told Tass that the raid on Budennovsk could have been
undertaken by ''a group of unorganised defiant supporters''.
About 40 people were killed, including eight attackers, and dozens
injured yesterday when the attackers stormed into the town of 100,000,
opening fire with automatic weapons and grenade-launchers.
''They opened fire at the doors of nearby buildings. They seized women
and those who tried to resist were shot. They didn't spare anybody,''
said a tearful middle-aged schoolmistress.
Some of the gunmen wore the green headbands of Islamic militants, just
as fighters from rebel Chechnya have done in clashes with Russian
soldiers which followed a major Russian assault on the southern region
starting last December.
Today Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev gave a toll of 37 police
and servicemen, as well as ''countless'' civilians. He had said up to
1000 hostages were being held.
Earlier today Russian troops exchanged fire with the gunmen. Soldiers
with flak jackets and automatic weapons scuttling through the dusty
streets came under fire from fighters inside the hospital, witnesses
said. The soldiers replied with automatic weapons fire.
President Boris Yeltsin appealed to Russians to keep calm and support
Moscow's campaign in Chechnya, saying the raid had shown the Chechen
rebels' true face. He also made clear his displeasure with the country's
law enforcement organs.
''We will have to find out how such an act was allowed to happen, and
why those who are responsible for maintaining the law and order allowed
the situation to get out of control,'' he said.
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, criticising President Boris
Yeltsin's leadership, said the raid was ''an act of despair'', a
reaction to Russian military operations in Chechnya in which thousands
of people have died.
''It is impermissible that peaceful innocent people pay with their
lives for schemes and mistakes of politicians,'' Gorbachev said in a
statement urging a political settlement.--Reuter.

ROME: Nearly 100 Alitalia pilots suddenly went sick yesterday in a
wildcat strike that paralysed Italy's state airline for a second day.
Thousands of angry passengers were stranded, some for a second day, and
the government ordered the 97 pilots to go back to work or face legal
sanctions and medical tests. The pilots' tactic is designed to sidestep
laws requiring advance notice for strikes.
Meanwhile, a one-day stoppage by striking Air Malta staff trapped
thousands of holidaymakers on the island. Flights resume today.

Nicosia, Thursday
THE Supreme Court of Cyprus today reserved judgment on a defence plea
to dismiss the case against three British soldiers accused of killing a
Danish tour guide last September.
The defence claims the defendants' constitutional rights were violated
when prison guards confiscated confidential notes the soldiers had
prepared for their lawyers.
The court spent two days hearing legal arguments for and against the
dismissal of the case, which was referred to the Supreme Court by a
lower court last month to rule on legal points.
The three soldiers, Privates Justin Fowler, 26, of Falmouth, Cornwall;
Alan Ford, 26, of Birmingham; and Jeff Pernell, 23, of Oldbury, West
Midlands, all of whom serve with the Royal Green Jackets Regiment
stationed at the Dhekelia base, are charged with the manslaughter of
Louise Jensen after kidnapping her.
They have yet to enter pleas.
Defence lawyer Antonis Andreou told the Supreme Court: ''If there was
a violation of their rights, then the trial must be invalidated, no
matter how serious the crime.''
The court is expected to rule before the end of the month.--AP.

Egion, Thursday
AT LEAST 17 people were killed today when a powerful earthquake
destroyed two seaside buildings in a Greek tourist resort and trapped
victims under rubble and shattered slabs of concrete.
The death toll climbed as four people were pulled out dead from the
rubble of the Eliki hotel near the south-western port of Egion. They
were a French family of three and another French tourist.
The French embassy said there were 159 French guests at the hotel. The
152 accounted for included the dead, which left seven missing.
Three other people who had not been identified were earlier confirmed
killed in the hotel.
The collapse of a residential apartment building in Egion killed 10
more, including a 20-year-old Italian woman and three children. Up to 10
people were missing.
The quake, 6.1 on the Richter scale, hit the town 90 miles west of
Athens in the early hours. The government said 59 people were injured
and taken to hospital.
Rescue teams were tonight trying to pierce slabs of collapsed concrete
to reach those trapped. Cries for help heard earlier had faded, police
said.
''Everything collapsed in five seconds,'' said Brian Clavaud, a
Frenchman who works at the Eliki hotel. ''I don't see how the people
trapped inside will survive.''
French and Swiss rescue teams were on their way to the scene to help
Greek teams, a government spokesman said.
At the residential building, bulldozers and cranes shifted the large
slabs of concrete but workers said the work was going very slowly and
they feared few of those trapped would survive.
Eleni Seriato, 31, who lived on the third floor of the block, escaped
with her eight-year-old son, but her husband and 11-year-old son were
trapped inside.
''My husband was behind me when we were trying to escape. A piece of
mortar fell on him and he was trapped,'' she said.
Officials later said her son was dead.
Another woman, Flora Katsarioti, said she scurried through a crack in
a wall to safety.
''My mother was trapped in the next bedroom. I could hear her cries
but we were separated by rubble. We had to leave her behind,'' she said,
fighting tears.
The quake caused damage from the western port of Patras to the tourist
village of Ancient Delphi, perched high on a hillside across the Gulf of
Corinth, and nearby Galaxidi town.
Public works officials declared about 500 buildings uninhabitable
because of cracks and collapsed walls. About 200 tents were set up to
house hundreds of people whose homes were declared unsafe.
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou expressed his ''deepest sympathy''
to the families of the dead.--Reuter.

The home sick boy who turned into the hard man of football.
THE soiled linen of Danielle and Graeme Souness's stormy marriage has
been well and truly washed and hung out on banner headlines these past
days with little dignity left on either side. You wonder if people ever
stop to consider the children.
On the matrimonial level, psychiatrists have their own standard
judgment of what happens. Even when contemplating marriage, they will
tell you, men have an inborn resistance to women, a personal animosity
at an unconscious level, which they generally manage to shed before
proceeding to the much likelier success of the second-time-round.
More interesting than the Souness marriage, however, the man himself
becomes the fascinating study of the working-class Scottish lad, brought
up in an Edinburgh prefab, blessed with an exquisite footballing talent,
who comes face to face with high success -- then seems to blow it.
Many in Scotland are still working out why in 1991, at the point of
triumph with a vista of much more to come, Graeme Souness suddenly
walked away from his friend David Murray, chairman of Rangers, and all
they were building together in the quest for European success.
One moment he was declaring he would not contemplate leaving his
manager's job at Ibrox for the Liverpool vacancy created by the
departure of his friend, Kenny Dalglish; but soon he was off to that
same job.
Was he lured back to the scene of his greatest playing triumphs by a
secret desire to win the European Cup again, this time as manager?
Was it a furious reaction to the punishment meted out by the ruling
body of Scottish football, with which he was constantly at loggerheads?
Or a gesture to the Scottish press, which criticised him at its peril
but let him away too often with the sycophantic soft-pedal?
A persecution complex? An itchy finger on the button of self-destruct?
The puzzle may never be solved.
What we do know is that the seeds of conflict were with him from early
days.
Brought up in the Saughton Mains district of Edinburgh, he went to the
same school as the great Dave Mackay, the Spurs and Scotland star who
spotted him. He followed Mackay's golden route to White Hart Lane.
But he walked out with mutterings of homesickness.
Then came a second chance, this time at Middlesbrough, where there
were rows and he was asked to leave.
Thus came the greatest playing opportunity of all, the offer to join
high-flying Liverpool, the greatest team in England. And there he
emerged as the natural successor to the Jim Baxters and Paddy Crerands.
Enter Danielle, daughter of a Merseyside multi-millionaire
businessman, Austin Wilson, who had retired to Majorca and settled on
her a trust of #750,000.
Souness was soon on his way to Italy, orchestrating a Sampdoria team
owned by a man called Mantovani.
Meanwhile, back in Scotland, the Rangers' domination, which had long
been suffering from the power of Jock Stein's Celtic and the
impertinence of Alex Ferguson's Aberdeen, needed restoring.
At 33, Graeme Souness was dramatically produced as the player-manager
of a club still owned by the John Lawrence family.
But in his very first match, back on the home territory of Easter
Road, Edinburgh, he was ordered off for an incident which sparked off
rammy. Souness confessed he looked up at the grandstand, spotted his
father and felt ashamed. Rangers were fined #5000 and he was banned for
three games.
However, the new man did go on to claim the premier division
championship, Rangers' first for nine years.
At the start of his second season he was ordered off again, against
Celtic at Parkhead, charged with verbally abusing referee David Syme,
who later described him as ''the most arrogant, spoiled man I have ever
come across in football''. Syme added: ''As a player, he was one of the
dirtiest tacklers I have ever seen.''
All this of a man who was also one of the silkiest performers to pull
on a Scottish jersey.
By November 1988 there were sensational happenings of a better tone at
Ibrox. Wealthy industrialist David Murray, a friend of Souness, bought
over Rangers at the unthinkable bargain price of #6m, giving the manager
the chance to take a 10% stake.
Shrewdly, Murray was giving him good reason to stay around. The
Souness family set up home, luxuriously, in Edinburgh but were soon
hitting the headlines with the announcement that the marriage was on the
rocks. Danielle had gone back to Majorca with the children.
Through continuing conflict with the SFA, he changed the Rangers'
habit of a century by signing the most controversial of Roman Catholics,
Maurice Johnston, who had nearly gone to Celtic. That inevitably brought
flak from some Ibrox supporters but applause from the rest of Scotland.
Fined #5000 for breaching a touchline ban, Souness told an
interviewer: ''There's a lot I don't like about myself but there are
some things which are just you and can't be changed, no matter how you
try.''
There were things which other people didn't like either. The Herald's
James Traynor turned up at a Souness press conference to be told that
his recent critical article was an unmentionable substance and that he
was just jealous that Rangers players earned ten times what he earned.
Traynor was dismissed as ''a little socialist'' and banned, just as had
happened to the Express man and Scottish Television.
Were the pressures too much? Whatever the cause, he wasn't learning,
plunging into further trouble with the SFA for saying there were too
many hammer-throwers in Scottish football.
But he was not alone in feeling pressure. Kenny Dalglish was quitting
Liverpool and rumour was rife that Souness would replace him. There were
denials and vows of loyalty to Rangers. But off he went.
David Murray told him quietly he was making the biggest mistake of his
life. The 10% share of Rangers was now worth #1m. And from the court
case just finished, he appears to have indicated that his fortune has
now risen to #8m. Not bad for a wee lad from Saughton Mains.
But the pressures were building. After less than a year at Liverpool
he felt unwell and the diagnosis was shattering: an immediate heart
by-pass -- or you will die.
Was there no end to Souness's misfortunes? With the football club
heading for its worst season in 30 years, he found himself in trouble
with English referees -- and faced the grief that his loving father, who
had had the same heart operation as himself, had died of a heart attack.
Events overtook him and he finally quit the Liverpool job last
January. He now manages Galatasaray of Turkey.
More recently still came the libel suit against the People newspaper,
after Danielle's accusations brought the headlines of ''dirty rat''.
As a leading psychiatrist confirmed to me last night, there is a
psychological condition where people can go along quite smoothly in
their daily lives, being charming, pleasant and competent. Suddenly they
will do something which seems quite crazy. It is something which is easy
to condemn, if less easy to understand and grant sympathy.
Yet sympathy and understanding may well be what it needs -- except,
of course, when you collect #750,000.

THEY had everything. Cars, money, children, expensive designer
clothes, lavish homes, holidays, social status, fame, respect.
Talent brings its admirers. Souness was indulged because he had it. He
and and his wife and family were cushioned against the world and its
nasty ways because his skill and her wealthy background gave them power.
Power has been the operative word in this laborious libel case. George
Carman, QC, has made much of his, citing Danielle's alleged lack of
self-esteem as being the result of Graeme Souness need to dominate and
control.
There are instances in life, where dependent women are deliberately
kept short of money in order to curtail their freedom. But Danielle is
not one of them. She does not rely on any man for money except her
father.
Let's examine the facts. Danielle Souness has never worked. She's
never had to. She has, therefore, no sense of the humilation grafting
for every penny often brings. Danielle has always had a private income.
Indeed, when she met the Liverpool footballer Graeme Souness in 1978,
she was sure that given his own hefty pay packet he was not a man who
would want her for her money.
Danielle Souness was used to money materialising when she needed it,
Souness was used to earning large amounts through the pressure of
high-profile hard work.
It was both Graeme and Danielle's similar approach to income and
status which brought them together and which subsequently pulled them
apart, because status and income are what they traded, not love. Souness
found that for real with Karen Levy.
Rather than have any idea of what real womanhood is all about (their
fathers are the ones most likely to have pushed them), footballers are
often seen with female impersonators. Not transvestites, but women who
share the same make-up and attention to detail.
I don't believe that anyone would be prepared to stand up and say that
footballers are an emotionally mature lot.
The beautiful game is a glorified boys' clubs. If he's lucky and
liked, he will be promoted through the ranks. The idolisation, the media
attention, and the money follow.
But what a boy from a prefab can not escape is his class. He can't
change his social history. Unless by marriage.
What Souness found in Danielle, at a time when he needed it, was the
security of an equal financial partner, and an intelligent choice of
wife, that of a millionaire's daughter rather than a childhood
sweetheart or football groupie, a woman who knew how to behave in the
right circles. His, was, to all intents and purposes, an arranged
marriage.
What Souness didn't understand in his cynicism, was that in the equal
partnership he desired, what went on behind closed doors, not the show
of wealth, was what would make or break the relationship. Souness has
always been suckered by the superficial, the trophy. And in Danielle,
too, he received the bonus prize of coming face to face with the same
ability to manipulate.
Danielle was the control freak in her second marriage. It was the only
insurance she had for getting her own way.
Happy to subsist in the glamorous limelight of an international
player-manager, she turned on Graeme's success when the marriage started
to fold. She gave Souness an ultimatum.
He had to give up the job he adored with Rangers and live with her and
the children in Majorca, and, as workaholic Graeme put it, ''do
nothing''. It was emotional blackmail, the resort of the terminally
insecure.
It was the beginning of her public contempt for the man she had once
regarded as her way out, both of single parenthood and the bind of being
regarded as a kept Daddy's girl.
The mutual shenanigans in the night, of ferrying hundreds of thousands
of pounds from joint bank accounts, and the arguments where both
divorcees taunted each other about their financial affairs, relates that
both sides are a bit touchy about cash.
Money was always important to Souness because as a boy he didn't have
any. Money was important to Danielle because it was the one thing she
could count on.
To Souness, generosity signifies love. Which is why, Danielle is
allowed no more of his money because he no longer cares.

THE reputation of the Conservative Party as the one which really
understands economics, the City and all that stuff that baffles ordinary
mortals, took another drubbing yesterday.
So uncertain are the Tory Whips that their chaps will know what
supportive questions to ask their Treasury Ministers at Question Time,
or what devastating animadversions to make about Shadow Chancellor
Gordon Brown and his policies or lack of them, that they are dishing out
crib sheets.
Not only is the Tory grip on economics slackening, but their
observance of security precautions is also leaving a lot to be desired.
One left his briefing material in a Commons telephone kiosk where it was
found by a Labour MP who bore his prize into the chamber in triumph.
However, Mr Kenneth Clarke is probably the most unembarrassable
Minister in the Government and when asked by Mr Joe Ashton (Bassetlaw --
Lab.) why he had to write out the sound-bites for the simpletons behind
him, the Chancellor merely smiled and observed that Mr Brown ''doesn't
have a policy that's worth leaving on a piece of paper in a telephone
box.''
It is, of course, precisely this insouciance that leads him, as it did
earlier in the day, to attack ''right-wing xenophobes'' leaving all the
right- wing xenophobes behind him foaming at the mouth.
Perhaps, snarled Mr Bernard Jenkin (Colchester North -- Con.), small
businessmen could raise their worries about the likely impact of a
single European currency on them, without being dubbed right-wing
xenophobes, showing the shaft had gone home.
Mr Clarke is also one of the few Ministers who doesn't seem to
particularly mind being in trouble. He recalled in mid-sentence that a
reference to looking after Middle England in the previous night's
Mansion House speech might have offended the Scottish Nationalists and
said he had meant Middle Scotland as well.
The Nationalists, rivalling Queen Victoria's sense of humour, declined
to be amused and the victor of Perth and Kinross Ms Roseanna Cunningham
issued a press statement complaining that it looked as if the Tories had
decided to abolish Scotland and ''merge us with Middle England''.
Not only was Mr Clarke beginning to resemble a one-man Light Brigade
with cannon firing from behind as well as in front of him, but even
those in his own squadron showed signs of breaking ranks.
His deputy, Mr Jonathan Aitken -- who had just sworn yet again that as
far as he knew arms contracts for Singapore of a firm with which he was
once a non-executive director were indeed going to Singapore -- did an
alternative turn on the single currency, which fell just short of
pronouncing its epitaph.
Although undoubtedly knowing that the Chancellor retains a soft spot
for the concept, Mr Aitken proclaimed that it seemed to be receding
''into an uncertain and distant horizon.''
The Prime Minister, meanwhile, had receded over the horizon to Canada
where the travails of the world economy may seem welcomingly less
exciting than those of his own Government and party.
Was it thought wise at this time for the Prime Minister to be out of
the country, asked Mr John Prescott smugly, hardly having to conjure up
images of plots and planned coups.
He certainly had the material to work with. Baroness Thatcher had made
clear that Major was not up to the job he barked. The Chancellor was
calling his right-wing xenophobes. Heseltine was ''preparing to take
over''. Was not the Tory Party in a state of civil war and, like the
Prime Minister, clearly unfit to lead the country.
Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the Commons, did his best but the Government
side is virtually writing the Opposition's script for it on a daily
basis.
Shadow spokesmen no longer wake up each morning wondering ''what will
we hit the Tories with today''. Instead, they switch on the radio and it
is all there for them.

LABOUR will press its case for an independent inquiry into the
possible illegal supply of arms to Iran by BMARC -- the company of which
Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken was a non-executive director -- in a
three-hours Commons debate next Monday.
Opposition MPs are already expressing concern that a Government
cover-up may be under way, despite the full statement on the affair made
to the House by President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine on
Tuesday.
His Shadow, Dr Jack Cunningham, said yesterday he thought it strange
that Mr Heseltine was now saying there was no DTI internal report ''as
such'' on BMARC, and that he should clarify his remarks on what
intelligence material could be provided to any inquiry .
In a letter to the Prime Minister, Dr Cunnigham asked for an assurance
that all relevant information from Governent departments involved would
be made available to an inquiry.
He also asked if there was not a danger that some information would
become sub judice as a result of the Customs and Excise inquiry which is
already in progress.
Mr Richard Caborne, Labour chairman of the Commons Select Committee on
Trade and Industry which is considering an investigation of its own, has
contacted Mr Heseltine seeking assurances that any inquiry would not be
hampered by the department's unwillingness to provide documents.
During questions to Treasury Ministers, Mr Aitken repeated his
statement to the Commons that he had no knowledge that arms produced by
BMARC had been shipped on to Iran. He made a similar declaration when
the affair first blew up in March.
He told MPs: ''I am absolutely certain at the end of the day they will
clear my name completely.''
Challenged by Labour's Dennis Skinner (Bolsover), he said: ''I am glad
to have this chance to repeat again to the House that I stand by the
statement I made on March 30, namely that I was given not the slightest
indication or information, as a non-executive director, that any of
these contracts that were going to Singapore were in any way going to be
for onward shipment to Iran or anywhere else.
''I welcome these new inquiries that are taking place and I am
absolutely certain at the end of the day they will clear my name
completely.''

SEX has found its way on to the summit agenda. Local health officials
want delegates and journalists to take away ''positive memories'' and
nothing else when they leave.
To that end, they are distributing free condoms. The original idea had
been to include a handful in the multi-coloured bags full of freebies
handed out to each visiting hack. But, says medical man Tony Eden, ''we
didn't want to offend anyone''. Instead, they are being left in tasteful
baskets scattered around the Media Centre.
The idea of 2000 plus journalists roaming Halifax clutching condoms in
search of something more interesting than a German press briefing shows
just what optimists those crazy Haligonians are.
FOR The Herald, however, there was only one way to find out: on Hollis
Street, 1am. At the sharp end of the Halifax hospitality effort, night
worker Rhonda has seen no evidence of sex-starved delegates. She is
offering a summit discount, but with little success. ''All those
security men and reporters in town and no action''. And before you ask,
the answer is no. I was simply returning a rental car and happened to
pass by.
JUST to show we haven't forgotten the rest of the world here in the
media bunker - free phones, free pastries, free briefings and no natural
light -- some news from the rest of Canada. While the Halifax monsoon
which has drowned out much of the summit's opening ceremonies has led
the news here, several thousand miles west in Saskatchewan lightning
season has begun and forest fires are raging. Up to ten a day are
starting in some areas, and a number of towns so remote that the only
way in is by kayak or light plane have had to be evacuated. Not that
anyone has noticed.
A 300-MILE rain-drenched tour of Nova Scotia in search of some New
Scots has turned up some preliminary findings: New Scotland is a
shortbread and tartan lover's delight; local radio stations play ''Over
the sea to Skye'' far too often; the roads are straight, the road signs
mysterious -- what does ''use 4-way flashers below 70 km per hour'''
suggest to you?. Regret of the day? Missing the exit to Stewiacke, the
town whose signs proudly proclaim it to be ''halfway between the North
Pole and the Equator''.
THE local press has made much of the costs of the summit. So much, in
fact, that the figure has been climbing steadily by the hour. The figure
began at $23 million (about #12m) on the radio on Wednesday, went up to
$28m to $36m in the papers, and by my last check at lunchtime yesterday
had reached $37m (#19m). However, excitement has outnumbered complaints,
not surprising for a small town with seven universities, lots of
lobsters, and nothing particularly exciting to offer. Halifax's ''Love
the way we live''' summit sounds a bit optimistic.
FINALLY, silly story of the day. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police
helicopter redefined the drive-through concept by landing in a petrol
station forecourt. the pilot hopped out, bought two sandwiches and a
Coke, and lifted off to continue patrolling the summit skies. The
lunchtime visit, the cashier said, was prompted by the petrol company's
advertisement jingle, ''drop in and visit us any time''.

THE SNP is to turn the question of who owns land in Scotland into a
major issue in the build-up to the next General Election, party leader
Alex Salmond announced yesterday.
The party is increasingly concerned about absentee ownership of large
tracts of Scotland, and has tabled a series of Commons questions on who
owns what.
The questions have been put down by Perth and Kinross MP Roseanna
Cunningham -- victor in the recent by-election -- who is the SNP's
Environment spokesperson.
Following reports that the Government has approved #400,000 in grants
to a Swedish Government-owned company to plant trees on an estate it
owns in Scotland, the SNP wants the setting up of a proper land register
and restrictions on ownership.
Ms Cunningham is demanding that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang numbers
and names the foreign-owned companies which currently own estates in
Scotland, and names the foreign-owned companies which have been paid
Government grants to plant trees in Scotland in the past five years.
She also wants to know how much has been paid out to foreign-owned
companies to plant trees on estates in Scotland in the current financial
year and how much has been allocated up to 1998.
Ms Cunningham told a Westminster news conference yesterday: ''The
ownership and use of land in Scotland has been a major issue for
decades. The fact that a comprehensive register of who owns the land,
and how they use it, has not been completed is an example of the
near-feudal nature of Scots land law.
''The fact that the Conservatives are prepared to pay another
country's Government for growing trees in Scotland shows how this
Government has little concern for land as a resource to be used for the
nation's benefit.
The Forestry Commission stood by its commitment that woodland grants
were available to improve the quality of the countryside and that grants
were based on delivering benefits to the public.
A spokesman said: ''We make grants in aid to schools, farmers, or
whoever. They are there to provide greater public benefit, not to
benefit the owner, and are not based on what their income or nationality
might be.''

UNION leaders and Labour left-wingers yesterday urged Tony Blair to
abandon his ''cautious'' approach and harden his policies for
government.
They called for firmer measures to create full employment, stronger
spending commitments, higher taxes on the rich and a definite figure for
the minimum wage.
Two groups, the Full Employment Forum and the Campaign to Defend the
Welfare State, launched a joint pamphlet setting out their demands.
They insisted they were not criticising party heads, but their
proposals went considerably further than the leadership has been
prepared to go.
Among those backing yesterday's pamphlet were GMB general union leader
John Edmonds, Transport and General Workers' Union leader Bill Morris,
and left-wing MPs Ken Livingstone and Roger Berry, both critics of the
leadership.
Mr Berry, MP for Kingswood, said Labour had not won previous elections
by being cautious, but by offering policies which were significantly
different.
More money must be spent on improving housing, education and training,
community care, public transport and the environment, he said.
Mr Berry also insisted that the party support a fair tax system, which
meant placing ''fewer burdens on people on low incomes and relatively
higher burdens on people on high incomes''.

THE general manager of Dumfries and Galloway Health Board and his wife

Mr Derek Banks, 47, and his wife, Pauline, 42, both of Maxwell House,
Corsock, Castle Douglas, will stand trial in two weeks after their
solicitor entered a not guilty plea to all charges.
They are charged with pretending to two police officers that Mrs Banks
was driving a car which was involved in an accident on the Dalbeattie to
Gatehouse of Fleet Road on November 27 last year near Cally Road
junction, Gatehouse of Fleet.
The charge further alleges that Mr Banks had been driving and that he
and his wife had intended to deceive the officers and attempt to pervert
the course of justice.
Mr Banks also denies driving a car without due care and attention on
the B727 Dalbeattie to Gatehouse of Fleet road at the junction with
Cally Road and without reasonable consideration for other road users.
The charge further alleges that he failed to keep a lookout and failed
to comply with a give way sign, resulting in a collision with a car
driven by Mr Vincent Kelly, of High Street, Gatehouse of Fleet.

BRITAIN'S first woman Chief Constable yesterday revealed that it was
steely determination and the right skills which won her the job.
Mrs Pauline Clare, 47, who is to head the Lancashire force, said her
mission to win the job was planned for two years, and dismissed any
suggestion she may have been appointed for political correctness.
At a news conference at County Hall, Preston, where she faced the
media for the first time since yesterday's announcement, she said of her
appointment: ''I think it is extremely significant. Whether you are in
Lancashire or wherever, being the first woman is making history, and I
am very conscious of that, and delighted to be the first.
''I don't see any difficulties at all, I shan't be looking for them
and I don't think they will be there.''
Mrs Clare, who is currently deputy Chief Constable of Cheshire, and
who will take over from retiring Chief Constable Brian Johnson in
Lancashire, said: ''I think I got the job because I was the best
candidate.
''I am a very determined person and I set my sights a very long time
ago on being Chief Constable of Lancashire, and I hope I have gone
through the relevant experience and skills. I did have an eye on that,
and I have achieved it.''
Accepting that some people might suggest political correctness played
a part, she said: ''All I say is talk to people who work with me and
have worked with me in the past, and watch me perform, and I think they
will realise I got the appointment because I have the ability.''
Lancashire Police Authority insisted it had ignored the fact that its
new Chief Constable was a woman when appointing her ahead of four senior
male officers on the short-list.
Authority chairwoman, Mrs Ruth Henig, said: ''That wasn't an area we
covered. We had a number of criteria, matched the candidates against
those, and Mrs Clare had most, if not all, of the qualities we were
looking for.
''Gender, race, ethnic background -- none of these came into it at
all.''
Mrs Clare said of the future for her new force: ''Obviously there will
be changes, but I need to get into the force, talk to people, both
police officers and civilians, find out what has been achieved so far
and build on that.''

Benedict Brogan reports from Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the troubled
start to the Group of Seven summit
THE opening of the Group of Seven summit in Halifax was overshadowed
yesterday by a string of unresolved disputes which threaten to distract
leaders from their attempts to impose order on the world's economy.
A damaging trade dispute between the United States and Japan, renewed
fighting around Sarajevo, and France's decision to resume nuclear
testing in the Pacific is forming the backdrop for talks designed to
reform international financial institutions.
President Clinton last night threatened to go ahead with heavy
sanctions against Japan if the two countries did not reach an agreement
by June 28 in a dispute over car imports.
At a joint news conference after talks with President Clinton,
Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama urged the United States not to
carry out its threat to impose 100% tariffs on Japanese luxury cars.
Japan has accused the US of violating global trade agreements.
Despite the simmering disagreements, the summit is expected to launch
a drive against terrorism spearheaded by Britain, the United States and
Japan, centred on a new intelligence network co-ordinated with the other
G7 members -- Germany, France, Canada, and Italy.
John Major arrived in Halifax last night and went straight into his
first bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
Britain is pressing the United States to support the Bosnian rapid
deployment. One senior British source said the intention was to ''chivvy
America along to pay their whack''.
Last night, Mr Major said the summit would look at reform in a number
of areas, following the decision at last year's summit in Naples to
examine the future of the UN in its 50th anniversary year.
''We committed ourselves last year to look at some of the ways in
which the UN can be reformed. I don't think we should expect that
everything should be turned upside down. That's not the business we are
in,'' he said.
As the UN's principal source of funding, the G7 nations are anxious to
eliminate the waste and inefficiency which characterise much of the UN's
bureaucracy.
The summit's final communique, a version of which was leaked last
week, is expected to stop short of identifying those UN bodies the G7
would like to see abolished, but chief among them are the UN Conference
on Trade and Development, and the UN International Development
Organisation.
President Clinton said yesterday that resolution of the dispute with
Japan was in the long-term interests of both nations but added: ''I will
also make it clear to the Prime Minister that I am determined to carry
through on my efforts to open Japan's auto markets.''
He said: ''Millions of American exports and thousands of American jobs
depend upon our success.'' However, US sources said last night no
breathrough was expected at the summit.
G7 leaders are expected to approve an extension of the IMF's facility
for bailing out countries in financial crisis. The ''emergency funding
mechanism'' would make $28bn available at short notice for countries
whose economies hit a sudden financial catastrophe.
President Clinton said: ''We will embrace joint initiatives to contain
and defuse any crisis that does develop so that the US is not the
world's lender of last resort.''
The political controversy over France's nuclear testing programme
threatens to leave new President, Jacques Chirac, isolated among his
colleagues, who have condemned the decision.
Canada and Japan have called on France to abandon the test, at its
test-site on Mururoa atoll in the South Pacific. France has rejected the
suggestion that its programme makes a mockery of the test ban treaty to
be negotiated later this year.

AN inflatable fun island at the deep end of a swimming pool was a
danger, a sheriff said yesterday.
For, because of it, children who were not strong enough swimmers were
attracted to water that was 12ft deep.
Sheriff Michael Fletcher made his comments in his findings following a
fatal accident inquiry last month into the death of Kerry Clark, 10, at
Dumfries Swimming Pool on July 5 last.
He said he had come to the conclusion that she had been lured by the
island to the deep end although she was not a strong swimmer, and her
drowning had resulted from her use of it.
But the exact circumstances of her death in the busy pool remain a
mystery.
Sheriff Fletcher states that inflatable toys should be banned from the
12ft end of the council-owned pool unless two strict precautions are
taken:
* Only those with sufficient swimming ability to be at the deep end
are allowed to use them; and;
* Adequate supervision by lifeguards is provided at both sides of the
inflatable when in use.
The sheriff said it was clear that the number of lifeguards employed
on the day Kerry died -- four at the poolside -- fell within health and
safety commission guidelines and no criticism could be levelled against
the operators on this score.
But he thought it would be advisable to have a fifth lifeguard to
supervise the island so that there would be no blind spots.
The sheriff said the pool had a glass wall and on bright days -- such
as the day of the accident -- awkward glares and reflections could cause
serious difficulties for supervisors.
An experiment carried out after the tragedy indicated it was difficult
to see a body in the deep end. In addition, Kerry's swimsuit blended
with the colour of the tiles and the water.
Sheriff Fletcher said the Lochside and Lincluden Play Sheme, a
voluntary group which arranged the outing to the pool for Kerry and 18
other children, had asked parents to sign consent forms, but they
contained no question about swimming ability. He thought it was
important to include such a question.
He said there was a ''fun session'' at the pool when the children were
there. The inflatable island, anchored at the deep end, bucked as the
children moved along it towards a short water chute and it was likely
some would fall off.
''This was a great attraction for children,'' said the sheriff.
''Kerry was seen on it on a number of occasions and was seen to fall
into the water but no-one indicated she appeared to be in any
difficulty.''
Death might have occurred in less than four minutes, said the sheriff.
A woman swimmer had raised the alarm and there had been an immediate and
speedy reaction from all the lifeguards.
The Clarks' solicitor, Mr Lyall Moodie, said last night that he would
evaluate the sheriff's determination and the inquiry shorthand notes
with a view to raising an action for damages against Nithsdale District
Council and the playscheme.
Mr Howard Hann, director of Nithsdale District Council's leisure
service department, said that the inflatable island had not been used
since the tragedy.

THE Government was defeated in the Lords last night as peers backed a
move to broaden Ministers' plans to provide protection for the disabled
against discrimination.
Peers voted by 94 votes to 50, a majority of 44, for a Labour and
Liberal Democrat amendment to widen the definition of ''disability'' in
parts of the Disability Discrimination Bill.
The move would extend measures preventing discrimination against the
disabled in the area of goods and services to cover people who are not
significantly disabled and people who are ''perceived'' to be disabled.
The legislation, which has cleared the Commons, gives the disabled
greater rights of access to employment, goods and facilities and outlaws
employment discrimination. It provides for a National Disability Council
to advise Ministers.
However, disabled rights campaigners complain it does not go far
enough and have demanded stronger measures to ensure the disabled are
not discriminated against.
Baroness Hollis, who leads for Labour in the Lords on disabled rights,
said after the vote: ''Our victory tonight will forbid discrimination on
the grounds of perceived disability, whatever the real degree of
impairment.
''In other words, it covers cases where the problem of discrimination
lies with perception rather than with actual disability.
''People with mild disability who suffer discrimination, who would not
have been protected by the Bill, will now be protected.''
Lord Addington, for the Liberal Democrats, said: ''This is a victory
against prejudice. The fact that a person may be disabled in the future
should never be used as an excuse to discriminate.''
Labour's disabled rights spokesman Tom Clarke welcomed the Government
defeat, saying: ''This vote represents yet another victory for disabled
people.''
Highlighting Government concessions in the Commons on disabled access
to transport and education, he said: ''Now our colleagues in the Lords
have won yet more ground and I am confident this will not be the only
improvement we win in the Upper House.''
Earlier, Social Security Minister of State Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish
strongly opposed the amendment.
Urging peers to reject it, he said: ''The Government is determined to
keep the definition of 'disability' as close as possible to the common
sense view of what constitutes a disabled person. It would be extremely
difficult to establish legally what was in the mind of the service
provider who is accused of having 'perceived' a disability.''
Ministers now will have to decide whether to accept the amendment or
try to overturn it when the Bill returns to the Commons.

MINISTERS came under pressure from Tory MPs in the Commons last night
to scrap local authority capping in England and Wales and let council
tax payers bear the full brunt of ''profligate'' town halls. After the
Conservatives' local elections drubbing last month, senior Tories
including ex-Cabinet minister John Biffen pressed for the change in a
bid to woo back disenchanted supporters. Environment Secretary John
Gummer refused to commit himself during a debate on councils yesterday,
and one Conservative, Euro-rebel Christopher Gill (Ludlow), opposing
capping, said he had no option but to vote against the Government.

'Don't stop, wiggle wiggle' by the Outhere Brothers.  He said: ''This

PILOT error has been blamed for the RAF Chinook helicopter crash last
June which wiped out the top tier of Britain's anti-terrorist effort in
Northern Ireland.
The aircraft ploughed into a bleak hillside on the Mull of Kintyre,
killing all 29 people on board, including the head of the RUC's Special
Branch and nine of his senior colleagues, nine Army intelligence
officers and five MI5 operatives. Two RAF pilots and two crewmen also
died.
The casualties, from the security forces' Tactical Co-ordination
Group, the committee which links police and military intelligence
activity in the province, were reportedly en route for a secret
conference at Fort George, Inverness.
A summary of the Defence Ministry's air accident investigation,
published yesterday, says the pilots wrongly continued to fly towards
high ground in thick fog below a safe altitude.
This constituted ''a failure in their duty to operate the aircraft
safely''. It had therefore been concluded, regrettably, that both pilots
had been negligent.
However, the report fails to answer two basic questions. The first
must be some explanation as to why so many top intelligence personnel
were allowed to fly in a single helicopter, albeit a twin-rotor model.
The second is why an experienced crew, flying an aircraft which had
recently been upgraded and overhauled, were travelling at between 700
and 900ft in an area they knew required a minimum safety height of
3500ft.
The accident report said yesterday that navigation equipment had been
functioning accurately. Nor was there any evidence of ''catastrophic''
mechanical problems such as gearbox, engine or rotor blade failure.
Sabotage and speculation that electronic interference from a portable
phone might have affected the aircraft's navigation instruments were
also ruled out.
The height and bearing of the Chinook when it crashed indicate that it
may have been flying deliberately below civilian radar coverage from
Oceanic Air Traffic Control at Prestwick to avoid detection.
It was also on a track that would have taken it up the left of the
Mull of Kintyre, and not to the right along the usual air route to its
destination.
The Defence Ministry yesterday hid behind parliamentary privilege to
avoid being forced to comment on the mysteries surrounding the crash.
The summary of the accident report was released in the Commons as an
answer to a written question.
The official report says that no practical, additional safety features
in the aircraft's design would have saved anyone on board. A thorough
review of flying standards and supervision within RAF Support Command
had also failed to find any deficiencies which might have contributed to
the accident.
However, the RAF now plans to fit both accident data recorders and
cockpit voice recorders to every aircraft in its Chinook fleet over the
next three years. ''Black box'' devices have not previously been
standard on the aircraft.
Dr Susan Phoenix, whose RUC Special Branch husband was among the dead,
said last night: ''I still feel they really don't know. Human error is
always a very good thing to blame when you don't know.''
Dr Phoenix was also critical about the timing of the report. ''It is
very well presented and an excellent report. But it could have been
presented to us at Easter.''
She added: ''Our husbands were doing the best they could within a
system which has got rather top-heavy with people in suits.''
An RAF source said last night: ''Aircraft accident reports normally
take anything up to a year. In a straightforward incident with survivors
and witnesses, it can be less.
''In a situation like this where there were no survivors, it is a
painstaking task to go over the ground and try to recreate the situation
from forensic and engineering evidence.''

ROCK guitarist Rory Gallagher -- one of the world's leading white
blues musicians -- has died in a London hospital, aged 47.
Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, Gallagher sold 14 million
records over a career lasting 30 years.
He died on Wednesday at King's College Hospital, where he had
undergone a liver-transplant operation earlier this year.
Gallagher formed the group Taste in 1965 while a teenager but went
solo in 1970 after the band broke up.
Bono, leader of U2, yesterday described Gallagher as one of the top 10
guitarists of all time, adding: ''More importantly, he was one of the
top 10 good guys.''

SCOTLAND'S 43 free standing further education colleges are as
important to the well-being of the country's economy as the drinks and
textiles sectors, a major study has found.
The survey, commissioned by Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish
Office and carried out by Strathclyde University in Glasgow, shows the
colleges have a major impact on the wealth and job creation of the
country.
Between 1993 and 1994, the colleges, funded by the Scottish Office and
run by business-dominated boards of management, injected more than #600m
into the economy, sustained the equivalent of more than 19,000 jobs,
more than 8000 of which were outside the sector, and produced more than
#447m in income for households through staff salaries.
The study was based on Scottish Office budget data, a college survey
of expenditure and economic activity, information from student funding
bodies, and a review of student income and spending. It was the first of
its kind in the UK to attempt to quantify the economic impact of the
sector and also showed the output of colleges was more than #317m.
Students contributed an additional #98m from grants and bursaries and
about #3m came from visitors who stayed in colleges. The total
contribution to the Scottish economy before taking account of knock-on
effects was more than #420m.
Lecturers, however, are facing redundancy at two FE colleges seeking
to balance their books. More colleges are expected to make job cuts as
the impact of funding changes and the loss of more generous local
authority budgetary policies take effect.
The findings were revealed at a conference organised by the employers'
association, which represents colleges.

A LIEUTENANT who was forced to resign from the Army when she became
pregnant, agreed a confidential compensation settlement with the
Ministry of Defence yesterday.
Although the details were not disclosed, the amount is expected to be
considerable, especially when pension rights are taken into account.
Earlier, at an industrial tribunal in Glasgow, Mrs Susan Kerr, 39,
presently living in Northern Ireland where her husband is serving, said
that she had encountered a lot of hostility towards women while serving
in the Army.
She told the tribunal she was ''Army barmy'', and said that the
service had captured her imagination completely. ''I set my heart on the
Army as a career,'' she added.
''I liked the idea of belonging to something which was a large family,
the comradeship, the tradition and everything that went with it. I was
very proud to belong.''
However, after joining when she was 18, she found that as a female she
encountered a lot of hostility and had to stand her ground on numerous
occasions.
She said: ''At a cocktail party, a sergeant said he couldn't
understand why they had women in the Army anyway.''
A year after her marriage in July 1978, she was promoted lieutenant
and expected to serve until she was 37 and qualify for a pension.
An assessment found that she had not allowed her marriage to affect
her work and she was recommended for promotion to captain.
However, it was soon after learning that she was pregnant that she was
offered a long-awaited new post with the chance of promotion.
She told the tribunal: ''If at any time they had come to me and said
it was in the pipeline, I would not have started a family at that stage,
as I know it would have meant the end of my career.''
Mrs Kerr had to resign and went on to have two more children after her
daughter Charlotte was born in 1980.
She said she felt absolutely thrilled when she learned she was
pregnant, but ''gutted'' when she learned of her new posting.
If she had been allowed to remain in the service, Mrs Kerr said she
would have hired a nanny and expected she would have reached the rank of
major.

<HEADLINE>Trial told of pensions department 'panic'.  Old Bailey birthday for Ian Maxwell</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977862924</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE second youngest son of media tycoon Mr Robert Maxwell, Ian, spent
his 39th birthday at the Old Bailey yesterday listening to complex
financial evidence about pensions accounts.
Mr Ian Maxwell, his brother Kevin, 36, and former financial advisers
Mr Larry Trachtenberg and Mr Robert Bunn have denied conspiracy to
defraud the trustees and beneficiaries of the pension fund by misusing
#22m worth of shares in the Israeli company Teva to prop up the
crumbling Maxwell empire in the days after its founder's mystery death
at sea in November 1991.
Kevin also denies a similar charge of conspiring with his father to
use #100m share in another Israeli company, Scitex, to pay private
Maxwell company debts.
The jury heard from pensions investment administration manager Mr
Harold Abrahart that there was ''panic'' in the pensions department
after Mr Maxwell's death as staff tried to prepare documents for
inspection by City watchdog officials from Imro.
They were working to tight deadlines and anxious to ensure the
documents were all in place to satisfy the regulatory authority.
Mr Abrahart said in the past transactions had been known to come to
light after the event and he was keen to ensure that did not happen
again.
Mr Abrahart agreed with Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Kevin Maxwell that
in September 1991 he had produced accounts which showed that BIM --
Bishopgate Investment Management which administered the pension funds of
companies in the group -- no longer owned the Scitex shares and they had
been replaced by a cash deposit.
Although he had made this entry, Mr Abrahart said until the time he
left BIM in early 1992, Robert Maxwell Group (RMG) had never paid for
the Scitex shares.
Asked by Mr Jones why he had made the entry showing they had been
replaced by cash in BIM accounts, Mr Abrahart said it might have been
because of his work for a Caps (Combined Actuarial Performance Service)
return and also because he felt it was a more correct representation of
the folio performance.
Mr Abrahart was followed into the witness box by Mr Gwyn Gittins, now
working at a Colchester estate agents but formerly a BIM investment
co-ordinator.
Mr Gittins decribed how from August 1991 there were increasing
problems about getting money, which he believed BIM was owed, from RMG.
The failure of RMG to deliver the cash made it ''very, very
difficult'' for BIM to meet its commitments and obligations.
These problems arose on an almost daily basis from August and Mr
Gittins recalled one occasion in August when he had spoken to Mr Kevin
Maxwell about money BIM wanted that day to complete a transaction.
Twice, he said, Mr Kevin Maxwell had promised him that the money would
be in the bank that day, but it never arrived. The trial continues
today.

HUNDREDS of people were evacuated from their workplaces yesterday
after three fires caused havoc.
Two hundred British Gas staff fled from their Uddingston base when
fire broke out in a disused gasometer.
The fire -- which raged for two hours -- was thought to have been
caused by a stray spark during hot-cutting demolition of the tower.
Four hundred staff were evacuated from the Strathclyde House 2
headquarters of the regional council in Glasgow at lunchtime after a
blaze broke out on the top floor of the 11-storey building.
It is believed that a spark from cutting equipment used by a private
roofing firm ignited roof felt.
The fire was brought under control within 20 minutes. Staff were able
to return to the building, after an hour.
Meanwhile, thousands of wooden pallets were destroyed at the Maxwell's
Pallets yard in Mossend, Lanarkshire.
Firefighters took several hours to control the blaze which also tore
through a workshop. No-one was injured.

GREEK socialite Taki Theodoracopulos described yesterday how he fought
off three muggers in one of the most fashionable areas of London.
''If I had a weapon on me that night I would have happily killed the
muggers,'' he said.
Taki, as he is known, a socialite columnist and former karate
champion, escaped with nothing worse than a sore nose, throat, and rib
during what was plainly a savage fight on the pavement in Cale Street,
Chelsea, after an evening out.
The police arrived three minutes after a passer-by raised the alarm
but by that time the attackers were long gone. Taki said he was ''angry
as hell''.
He described the incident in his High Life column in the Spectator
magazine.
''I heard someone jogging, then running, then suddenly sprinting. Just
as I turned to see what was going on, I was hit violently from behind by
the runner in his early 20s, about 6ft or slightly shorter, of muscular
build and wearing a red jumper, blue jeans and trainers.
''The funny thing is that just as I got hit, my only thought was to
get his description. Fear either makes one fight better, or more often
than not it simply paralyses the victim.''
Taki said: ''Now despite the fact that I've been practising martial
arts for over 30 years I'd be fibbing if I said I held my own.
''While fighting off the first mugger who had me by the neck, I was
hit rather hard on the nose by the second, while the third was tackling
me.''
He continued: ''Some of my pockets had been ripped out, but I still
had my keys and some loose change. My family signet ring was missing but
it could have been ripped off my finger during the struggle.''
Taki, 57, said there had been countless such muggings in Knightsbridge
and Chelsea, and he called for better protection for residents,
including putting decoys on the streets.

THE Easdale ferry crosses the 200 yards between the Argyll mainland
and the tiny island of Easdale whenever one of the 60 inhabitants rings
a bell by the jetty.
On an average day, the ferry zigzags back and forth taking
schoolchildren, shoppers, and locals to work. During the year, there are
only around four days when ferryman Mr Andy McGuire cannot navigate the
choppy waters.
Though some islanders own boats, the service is a vital link for the
17 schoolchildren who use it daily and the handful of people working in
Oban. Many of the island's elderly inhabitants make the journey there
once a week to shop.
Yesterday, as Strathclyde Regional Council debated the future of the
ferry and the safety of the jetty, islanders detailed the ferry's
history and the complicated relationship between the region and the
island's owner.
If Strathclyde region blames the demise of the ferry on the absentee
landlord, some islanders point out that the region has not pulled out
all the stops to resolve the situation, failing, they claim, to dredge
the harbour.
Sitting in the front room of his whitewashed cottage, builder Mr Mike
MacKenzie put it simply: ''Ferries are a big issue on the island, on any
island. If the ferry goes, people would quite literally starve.''
He said that, over the years, the population of the island had changed
dramatically. In the sixties, the island was virtually deserted but
subsequently it attracted both holiday home owners and new residents.
There were now around 15 families on the island.
Since Mr Clive Feigenbaum bought the island seven years ago, Mr
MacKenzie said the issue of the jetty had never been satisfactorily
resolved. ''The owner inherited an old slipway that was never in good
condition in the first place.
''Strathclyde region has been trying to get the islanders to complain
against the owner. It is keen to see a new jetty built further along the
beach. That would look great but islanders would not be able to use it
30 days a year because of the tides.''
Mr Tony Sayles is retired and has been on the island for one year. He
does not own a boat and takes the ferry once a week to shop and every
Sunday to go to church. Without the ferry, he would be completely stuck
and would have no way of getting food.
At 6pm last night, the ferryman made his last trip to the island
before taking a dinner break. On board were a couple who own one of the
island's cluster of holiday homes. Sitting amid bags of provisions, they
said the cutting of the ferry service would be a disaster. They had
depended on it every summer for over 20 years.

TWO rapists snatched their terrified victim from a telephone kiosk at
knifepoint as she dialled for help, dragged her across six lanes of
rush-hour traffic, and subjected her to a two-hour sex ordeal in a
London park, yesterday.
The 24-year-old woman was attacked shortly after she left her work at
about 5pm yesterday to meet her husband nearby. She became aware she was
being followed in Great Portland Street, central London, and telephoned
her office.
Colleagues offered to send someone to meet her, but the men hauled her
from the kiosk at knifepoint and forced her across Euston Road and into
Regent's Park.
As they crossed the road in the rush-hour traffic a woman in a small
red car even manoeuvred around them.
The victim was taken to the park's Inner Circle, just a few hundred
yards from the Open Air Theatre, where there was a press night for a
Midsummer Night's Dream.
She was raped by both men, indecently assaulted, and her shoulders and
arms were cut with the knife. She lapsed in and out of consciousness
during the two-hour ordeal, having been hit over the head.
The men eventually made off, taking her handbag which contained cash
and credit cards.
The woman, from east London, wandered around dazed for some time
afterwards before she was found by another woman and taken to a nearby
police station. She was treated for lacerations, other minor injuries,
and shock.
Acting Detective Chief Inspector David Ryan said: ''This was an
horrific attack over a long period of time.''
He added that police were checking companies' security cameras in the
area in the hope the men may have been caught on film.
Detectives also want to trace the woman driving the red car, the woman
who found the victim and took her to the police station, and any
witnesses who may have been attending the theatre performance.
The first attacker was described as black, 5ft 7in, in his mid-20s,
slimly built, and unshaven with a bad complexion. He was wearing dark
blue corduroy trousers and a black jacket. The second was Asian, 5ft
9in, in his early 20s and broadly built. He was wearing light denim
jeans and jacket.

EURO MP Bill Miller is to demand a full explanation from the Scottish
Office for the reduction of late-completion penalty clauses against the
Italian consortium Castelli Girola over delays on upgrading the A74.
Mr Miller last night alleged the deal contradicted an earlier
assurance that there was ''no loss to the public purse''. He put the
loss at #400,000.
The Glasgow Euro MP will ask Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton for ''a full explanation of this debacle''.
His comments follow an exclusive Herald report that original penalties
in meeting the roads contract have been reduced from #250,000 a month to
#150,000 a month after ''a reassessment'' of the liquidated damages
clause.
Castelli Girola was already four months behind schedule in February --
and facing a #1m bill for delays -- when it called in Edinburgh-based
Morrison Construction to complete outstanding works between Eaglesfield
and Kirkpatrick Fleming for #4m.
It is understood the Italian group will now be charged #600,000 in
damages for delays to the project, due for completion soon.
In March, Mr Miller received a letter from Lord James over the
subcontracting of work to Morrison Construction, which stated in
part:''To facilitate the arrangements between the two contractors, some
technical adjustments have been made to their contracts, but I should
emphasise that there has been no adjustment of the price for either
contract and there is, therefore, no loss to the public purse.''
Mr Miller will now contact Lord James in writing, and tell him that
The Herald's revelation on reduced penalties is in ''complete
contradiction'' to the March statement.
The Euro MP will add: ''There is clearly a loss of #400,000 to the
public purse. This not inconsiderable sum is money that could have been
used for a variety of other projects.''
Mr Miller said the Scottish Office, at the time of awarding the
contract, was warned that the Italians would not fulfil the contract
because the #23.4m tender was ''low''.
He added: ''This advice was ignored, and Scots are now suffering the
consequences in terms of delays and financial loss.''
The Scottish Office has insisted the recent decision to reduce penalty
charges was taken for sound commercial reasons. The cut was on grounds
that the northerly section of road could not have opened until about now
anyway -- due to completion of a tie-in interchange at the Italian
stretch of road.

A STAND-OFF between an absentee landlord and Britain's largest local
authority is threatening a ferry service which is a lifeline for a small
community in Argyll.
The former slate-quarrying island of Easdale now has a population of
50, after years of decline.
However, the community's future will be in serious jeopardy if
Strathclyde region carries out its threat to stop operating the
12-person open boat ferry because it considers the island's landing
stage is getting into a potentially dangerous state of disrepair.
The council has been trying to persuade the island's owner, Mr Clive
Feigenbaum, who lives in Harrow, to repair the landing stage which he
leases to the council for the operation of the ferry. According to the
council's roads department, the repair could be done for about #15,000.
So far there has been no agreement. Strathclyde's chairman of roads
and transportation, Councillor Charles Gordon, yesterday called on Mr
Feigenbaum to act in a socially-responsible manner and come to an
agreement with the council with a view to preventing ''the devastating
social and economic consequences to the islanders'' that would flow from
a ferry closure.
He stated bluntly: ''If the landing stage becomes unsafe, it will be
closed and the islanders will be cut off. If that happens, then it's
because Mr Feigenbaum hasn't negotiated an agreement with us.
''I've had cheeky letters from islanders, complaining about the state
of the landing stage and demanding we should do something about it. I've
had to tell them to send their letters to the landowner.
''However, the landowner appears to have great difficulty in
responding to correspondence,'' he added wryly.
However, last night Mr Mike MacKenzie, who does building work for Mr
Feigenbaum on the island, claimed that the region had not kept its side
of the leasing agreement whereby it undertook to dredge the entrance to
the harbour and keep it open as a navigable channel.
He said: ''The dredging has not been carried out properly. The region
have mounted a campaign over the last few years to try and incite the
islanders to bring pressure to bear on Mr Feigenbaum. I feel this is
because they have a hidden agenda whereby they will abandon the slipway
inside the harbour, along with the responsibility for dredging the
entrance to the harbour, and build a new low water slipway outside the
harbour.''
In his view this could mean the ferry's being storm-bound for between
30 and 40 days of the year as opposed to the present situation where it
is unable to operate on four or five days per year.
Given that some islanders had jobs or business interests in Oban, such
a catastrophic reduction in the level of service could, in his view,
lead to serious depopulation of the island.
The council's roads and transportation committee was advised yesterday
that the landing stage was being constantly monitored by roads
department staff, principally the ferryman.
A recent engineering inspection indicated that, while there was some
deterioration over the winter, it was not yet at the situation where the
ferry service should be withdrawn.
The present lease to operate the ferry terminates in 2003, at which
stage the then owner could refuse to permit a ferry to run at all.
While the regional council has statutory powers to acquire
compulsorily the landing stage and such other land it may require, it
would appear to have no power at present to acquire the ''right of
ferry''.
The ''right of ferry'' -- the legal right to operate a ferry for use
by the general public -- lies within the disposition of the Crown. It
would appear to have been granted to the original owner of the island
and their successors. After 2003, ownership of the landing stages would
be of little use if the owner did not wish a public ferry.
Compulsory acquisition of the ''right of ferry'' may require a private
Act of Parliament to be promoted by the regional council.
The structure landing stage is of masonry slate, comprising steps
running parallel to the wall of the channel -- rather like the steps
running down the side of a stone pier.
Mr James Tolmie, Strathclyde's North Argyll network roads manager,
warned: ''It's true to say one major storm could finish it off,
depending on the direction of the wind.''

SCOTRAIL is to reconsider its policy on male staff wearing earrings
after threats of possible industrial action.
Four men working in the Glasgow area face disciplinary proceedings
over the wearing of earrings, which is banned for men under new rules
introduced by the company last autumn.
A copy of the dress code, which includes bans on tattoos, the wearing
of white socks, earrings of more than 25mm in length for women, and a
strict hats rule has been issued to each ScotRail employee.
A rail union official yesterday described the new dress rules as
''draconian'' and warned of the possibility of industrial action unless
the disciplinary threat was lifted.
However, a ScotRail spokesman, while not conceding that management had
done a U-turn over the matter, said: ''The wearing of earrings is a
matter which is under serious review at the moment. While that review is
ongoing, these hearings have been put in abeyance.
''Before any decision is taken, we will have to look at the safety
issues.''
Earlier, Mr Phil McGarry, of the Rail, Maritime, and Transport (RMT)
union, which represents 75% of the 4200 ScotRail workforce, confirmed
the four men working at Yoker faced disciplinary hearings for refusing
to remove earrings.
''They have been charged with not complying with standards in the
manual,'' he said. ''We are not going to stand by and allow people to be
disciplined. If the disciplinary charge sheets are not withdrawn, we
will be balloting our members on industrial action.''
The union official said he expected the hearings to take place within
six weeks.
Mr McGarry added: ''As public servants, we have never had a problem
with uniforms. These new rules are draconian and go beyond the bounds of
reasonableness. All we are asking for is fair play.''
He claimed the union had had no opportunity to challenge ScotRail over
the issue because no-one had yet been dismissed for breaching the dress
code.
The union official said morale within ScotRail had been ''at a low
ebb'' since privatisation plans were given the go-ahead in 1993. He said
new uniforms were due to be introduced by the company next year.
* The RMT is currently balloting members on a 3% pay offer. The union
disrupted the rail network nationwide with a strikes in a four-month pay
dispute with Railtrack last summer.

THE Trafalgar House Offshore platform construction yard at Methil,
Fife, has won two multi-million pounds contracts, safeguarding the jobs
of the 400-strong workforce for almost three years.
News that the company has beaten off competition to win the orders for
the central North Sea fields was confirmed yesterday.
The jackets and topsides were ordered by BP on behalf of the
participants in the Eastern Trough Area Project, a cluster of fields 150
miles east of Aberdeen.
Work is expected to start on both orders early next year and be
completed in two years.

JOB prospects for graduates are improving, according to a survey of
the destinations of university degree-holders between 1993 and September
last year.
The proportion of all graduates of the ''traditional'' universities
entering employment increased from 44% in 1992/93 to 46% in 1993/94,
while those undertaking further study or training fell from 30% to 28%.
And the proportion unemployed decreased from 9.5% to 7.7%.
Among UK graduates, the proportion securing full-time work rose to
48%. One in 10 graduates in engineering and technology, the humanities,
studies across disciplines, and biological sciences, were still looking
for work six months after graduating.

A THREE-year nightmare for neighbours of an ''anti-social''
mother-to-be ended yesterday when she was evicted.
Michelle Williamson, who is expecting her third child in eight weeks'
time, left her council flat at Aithernie Road, Leven, with her partner,
Alexander Allan, after an order from sheriff officers.
Police stood by following reports that there might be a weapon in the
house, but there was no sign of trouble as the couple and a young girl
were driven away. Williamson's own car had been wrecked during the
night.
Williamson, who had earlier held a conversation with the sheriff's men
from an upstairs window, swearing at them once, said as she left that
she was ''more pleased than anything'' to be going, then swore at
pressmen trying to question her.
Alexander Allan's parting message for neighbours was that they were
''f---ing bams''.
Delighted neighbour Miss Isabell Sturrock, 45, of nearby Baird
Crescent, said: ''It's a relief to see them go. They are not as bad as
the Grahams of Glenrothes, but we have had enough for three years.''
She claimed her dog had been attacked on four occasions by Mr Allan's
Alsatian and that she had been subjected to abuse every time she walked
by the house because she had called the police.
A terrified elderly neighbour who declined to give her name for fear
of reprisals said: ''I have had trouble with them for years. They have
been a bad lot. They have had gangs going in and you are frightened that
there are people on drugs who don't know what they are doing. They could
do anything to you. I am too old to stand any trouble.''
Adding that she had to put up with ''terrible language'' and
Williamson's garden being turned into a ''skating rink'' by dog filth,
the neighbour said: ''This used to be a very respectable place. It has
taken a long time to get them out. Thank goodness it's done.''
The sheriff officers refused to comment, but as a workman prepared to
secure the door of the flat, a Kirkcaldy District Council spokesman
said: ''We are pleased the eviction was effected without any problems.''
He added that once repaired, the house would be available for new
tenants.
The tough action was taken against Williamson by the council as part
of a new policy to protect neighbours from anti-social behaviour which
the authority has warned will not be tolerated.
In a written judgment, Kirkcaldy Sheriff William Christie branded
Williamson, who is in her mid-20s, as ''anti-social'', and also
highlighted the behaviour of Allan, who urinated through an elderly
woman's letterbox and ripped up a wooden fence for firewood.
The sheriff also stated that Williamson was ''extremely abusive''
towards a mentally handicapped neighbour who as a result was forced to
move elsewhere, adding that property belonging to the man was stolen by
Allan and recovered in the home of Williamson, who was convicted of
reset.

A JUDGE yesterday issued a warrant for the arrest of the Greenpeace
captain who is on board the ship shadowing the Shell-owned Brent Spar
oil installation which is to be dumped in the Atlantic.
The oil company asked Lord Johnston at the Court of Session to grant
an order to apprehend Mr Jonathan Castle after he failed to appear
before the judge in Edinburgh yesterday morning.
The judge issued a warrant allowing messengers-at-arms to bring Mr
Castle before him at the earliest opportunity to answer a contempt of
court charge.
Granting the order, Lord Johnston said: ''What exists here is an
apparent blatant attempt to defy the authority of this court which must
be more important than any other consideration or cause, however
genuinely felt or fought for.''
Mr Castle is on board the Altair, which is following the 65,000-tonne
installation, as it is taken to its final resting place in the Atlantic,
at a speed of one mph.
He was ordered to appear in court in Edinburgh earlier this week to
identify the activists who joined him in the earlier occupation of the
Brent Spar.
He was also ordered to explain his intentions and to give undertakings
which the court may require over reports that Greenpeace is planning to
use the vessel to interfere with the Brent Spar's progress.
Mr Paul Cullen, representing Shell, claimed Mr Castle was playing ''a
game of cat and mouse'' with court officials.
He said the ship's captain had given a TV interview, broadcast on
Scottish Television in which he said he would not be in court until the
Brent Spar saga had ended.
Mr Cullen said the activities of Greenpeace presented a ''serious
danger at sea''. He claimed Mr Castle knew he should be in court and had
''steadfastly'' refused to appear.
Shell fears Greenpeace campaigners will make further attempts to
disrupt the operation to dump the Brent Spar.
Lord Peter Melchett, UK director of Greenpeace, had also been ordered
to appear in court yesterday to identify those taking part in the
protest, but the court was told he was in Japan and not due back until
the weekend.
Mr Steven Thomson, 42, resources director, represented Greenpeace. Mr
Thomson told the court the organisation kept a list of supporters and
subscribers on a computer database.
He gave an undertaking to check the surnames of the 15 protesters --
whose names were taken by Shell following the occupation of the Brent
Spar -- against the Greenpeace files and provide full names and
addresses, if they could be found.
If the details match, Shell would then be in a position to seek court
orders against those who took part in the protest to prevent further
disruption.
Mr Thomson said that to his knowledge Greenpeace Ltd, his employers,
which is a subsidiary of Greenpeace UK, had given no financial or other
help to those involved in the earlier occupation and played no role in
the charter of the Altair.

Halifax, Nova Scotia
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will raise Germany's profound opposition to the
deep-sea disposal of the Brent Spar oil platform with Mr John Major when
they meet for bilateral talks during the G7 summit in Canada.
Shell's decision to sink its disused North Sea installation in the
Atlantic has sparked protests in Germany and the Netherlands, forcing
the company on to the defensive.
Indeed, a Shell executive indicated yesterday that the company would
reconsider the dumping if asked to do so by the British Government.
However, as Dr Kohl is likely to discover, such a decision by the
British Government is highly unlikely.
Last night Mr Major said he was prepared to talk to Dr Kohl about the
issue, but appeared to rule out Government intervention to force Shell
to dismantle the rig on land.
Mr Major said: ''As far as I'm aware the diposal of the Brent Spar is
in accordance with international law. There are agreements about that.
Those agreements have been met. That's the way it's going to be disposed
of.''
Summit sources confirmed the Brent Spar would be discussed as part of
the ''peripheral'' events of the summit, when individual leaders hold
one-to-one meetings with their counterparts.
An official spokesman for Dr Kohl last night said he was not expected
to raise the matter at any of the plenary sessions with his fellow
leaders of the world's seven most industrialised countries. But he
added: ''Germany is strongly opposed to the sinking of the Brent Spar.''
Arriving in Halifax early yesterday, Dr Kohl said: ''If I were a
company I would not do anything which would hurt my business.''
He will express his concerns when he meets with Mr Major, either today
or tomorrow. British officials said last night they would respond as and
when the matter arose, and insisted Agriculture Minister John Gummer had
made the British position clear at last week's conference on the North
Sea.
Reaction in Germany to Shell's proposal has been ferocious and has
prompted the company's embarrassed local subsidiary to complain that it
is powerless to prevent an action by its British sister company.
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who is accompanying Dr Kohl to Halifax,
said: ''These spectacular new forms of pollution are a setback for all
the efforts to protect our seas. The sea must not be abused as a waste
dump.''
On Wednesday a Shell petrol station in Germany was machine-gunned, and
German environmentalists have called for a boycott of Shell products.
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel described Shell's plan as
''unacceptable and intolerable''.
Environmentalists claim the platform contains chemical waste material
that will poison the ocean, and say it should be dismantled on shore.
But Shell says dismantling would cause worse environmental damage.
However, the company appeared yesterday to be softening its attitude
yesterday when it said it might yet bow to public opinion and reconsider
plans to dump the platform at sea if mounting pressure forces the
Government to change its position.
''Our president Mr (Jan) Slechte said that it must be a decision of
the British Government to reconsider -- and if they do so, Shell would
be the first one to talk with them,'' Shell spokesman Henk Bonder said
in Rotterdam.
But he emphasised that the Government, which reached agreement with
the company in February to sink the Brent Spar, would have to make the
first move if another solution was to be sought. This is thought to be
unlikely given Mr Major's statement.
Mr Slechte told Dutch television that Shell could see public opinion
was not in support of its dumping plans.
''Our company is built on the support of our customers and the public
in general,'' Mr Slechte said. ''Therefore we are prepared to restart
negotiations with the British Government.''
Dutch Greenpeace environmentalists said they were ''actively
encouraging'' consumers to boycott Shell petrol stations in protest at
the planned dumping, mirroring similar action by consumers and
politicians in Germany.

A NEW sheriff court is to be built on Dumbarton Common, which has been
in public ownership for more than 800 years.
The decision to sell part of the land to accomodate the three-storey
courthouse was taken last night on the casting vote of Provost Pat
O'Neill and ended a long-running dispute.
It brought uproar from demonstrators in the public benches who were
making a last-ditch protest against the eight-acre common being used.
They had hoped for a referendum among townspeople to decide whether to
sell the 1.5-acre court site.
Earlier, SNP group leader Mr Bill Mackechnie accused the
Labour-controlled council of disposing of land which was held in the
common good and used every day by local people.
''We do not have the right to sell this land without the authority of
the people who are the owners of this ground,'' he said. Provost O'Neil
argued that if ''a corner'' of the Common was not used the project would
go elsewhere and employment would be lost.
The council will now conclude negotiations with the Scottish Courts
Administration over the sale of the site, only a few hundred yards away
from the existing outdated sheriff court building.

GRAEME Souness was yesterday awarded #750,000 damages against the
People, the fourth highest libel award in history. But the judge ordered
a stay on #500,000 of the award pending an appeal.
The massive damages were over a May 1993 article which branded the
42-year-old Rangers and Liverpool manager a tight-fisted ''dirty rat''.
The article was based on an interview with Mr Souness's former wife,
39-year-old Danielle, who said Mr Souness ordered her, their sons Fraser
and Jordan, and adopted daughter Chantelle, to leave their Surrey home
by Christmas, 1992.
She also claimed that her ex-husband, of Mere, Knutsford, Cheshire,
had refused to pay the boys' school fees, and that she was living on
handouts from her parents.
Yesterday, amid the welter of accusation and recrimination between
them, the jury decided that Mr Souness had been wronged to a huge
extent.
After their unanimous verdict, which took just two hours, an emotional
Mr Souness, who grinned with triumph when he heard of his vindication,
said he was delighted.
Arm-in-arm with second wife Karen, 35, who had broken down at the
decision, he left the law courts to be met by cheers and a barrage of
press flashlights.
Before they were whisked away in a taxi, he said: ''It has been an
enormous strain both for me and my wife, and everybody close to me.
''I just want to go home and get on with my life,'' he said.
Publishers Mirror Group, which denied libel and said its story was
true, is now faced with a costs bill unofficially estimated at #250,000,
making a total #1m bill for the eight-day case.
Its lawyers said last night that they were ''exceptionally
disappointed'' and they planned to appeal.
Legal manager Martin Cruddace said: ''Once again it appears that the
jury on the question of damages has sought to punish the newspaper as
opposed to compensate the plaintiff.
''One must not forget that general damages ordered by a judge alone
for quadraplegia is only around #110,000.''
Mr Souness's QC, Lord Williams, claimed Danielle, of Penhouse Close,
Bramhall, Cheshire -- who was not in court -- had been used by the
People in a ''seedy, shoddy conspiracy'' to knock her former husband
when he was at a professional low.
Branded by Mr Souness as having developed ''an incredible aptitude for
telling lies'' since he had met Karen, she was also labelled by Lord
Williams, as a ''Judas'' who had betrayed Mr Souness by selling her
story for #15,000.
Lord Williams said it was a ''classic bit of sleaze journalism'' and a
''100% lie''.
He said the newspaper had shown ''all the courage of a dead chicken
and less decency than an elderly skunk'' in failing to check the story
with Mr Souness and by not giving evidence.
Mr George Carman, QC, for the newspaper, claimed Mr Souness was not
entitled to a penny ''morally or legally'' because his wounds were
self-inflicted.
He said he had behaved like ''The Great Dictator'' to Danielle in his
urge to exercise power and control over her, and had been prepared to
let his children suffer as a consequence.
He alleged Mr Souness, who is about to take up a contract as coach
with Turkish club Galatasaray for a reported #300,000 a year, had
offered less than #50 per week maintenance for the boys at a time when
he had a weekly average income of #15,000 -- or #8000 after tax.
Mirror Group later confirmed it intended to lodge an appeal against
all aspects of the decision.
''The damages awarded are wholly unrealistic and at a level that no
reasonable jury could determine; the judge's summing up was unfair and
misguided; Lord Williams, QC, was not restrained from making untruthful
and unsubstantiated statements,'' said a spokesman.
Lawyers, publishers and even judges have called for reform of a system
which places the setting of libel awards entirely in the hands of
inexperienced jurors.
They have suggested a variety of reforms, ranging from a set scale of
damages to placing the decision in the hands of the judge.
In medical damages cases, judges decide on the level of damages.

THE Tory candidate at the recent Perth and Kinross by-election
yesterday admitted, for the first time, that policy rather than
presentation lay behind his party's defeat by the SNP.
Mr John Godfrey accepted that, in a bid to win the seat back for the
Conservatives, there were lessons to be learned from the by-election
campaign. ''My commitment to the Union remains absolute but there are
other issues which the electorate found equally if not more pressing,''
he said.
The official line to date has been that mid-term blues and
presentational problems lay behind the defeat but Mr Godfrey went much
further yesterday, identifying the need to create a ''feel-safe factor''
to win back support on home ownership, care for the elderly, and
graduate unemployment.
Behind Mr Godfrey's insistence that he would stand again in the seat
taken last month by the SNP lay the first acceptance that Government
policies were the reason for the defeat.

EXCLUSIVE
HIGHLAND Regional Council is to return to the Court of Session in
Edinburgh today to begin a fresh challenge against British Rail
Franchise Director Roger Salmon's decision to axe the Fort William
sleeper.
The Herald understands that Highland region will seek an interim
interdict to prevent British Rail from starting the formal consultation
procedure for the withdrawal of the service.
However, its long-term aim is to seek a judicial review of Mr Salmon's
decision on the sleeper, taken without first preparing criteria for
approval by the Secretary of State for Transport. Under the 1993
Railways Act, Mr Salmon is required to do this to ensure the benefits of
loss-making services are fully considered.
The Department of Transport confirmed earlier this week that Mr Salmon
still had not drawn up the criteria. A spokesman argued that it was
sufficient for the director to base the initial passenger service
requirements on the timetable operating immediately before franchising.
But Highland councillors argue that timetable is only in existence
because of Mr Salmon's decision in December.
Meanwhile, the council has also warned that if the British Railways
Board does not take a firm decision on the restoration of a normal
booking service at its meeting today, it will also take further legal
action on that issue.
Last night, a cross-party group of Scottish Opposition MPs were told
by Mr John Welsby, chairman of the BR board, that it planned to delay
its decision on whether to appeal to the House of Lords over the future
of the service.
Highland region convener Mr Duncan McPherson said last night: ''We
have been very patient. We have waited for this meeting because we were
told the issue was to be discussed. This service is desperately in need
of proper marketing and you can't do that when you don't have a proper
booking service. We won't hesitate to take further legal action on this
issue.''
The board meets today for what was thought to be a final decision on
whether to appeal to the House of Lords over a court ruling which
supported continued sleeper services on the Fort William line until
after full public consultation on its proposed closure.
However, the delegation of MPs was told that this meeting will be
simply an exercise at which lawyers and the board members will examine
the issue, with a final decision unlikely to be made until next week.
Last night's delegation was headed by Labour's transport spokesman Mr
Henry McLeish, who was joined by the Liberal Democrats' Mr Charles
Kennedy and the SNP's parliamentary group leader Mrs Margaret Ewing.
ScotRail has said that no bookings would be taken for the sleeper
beyond the end of this month. After last night's private meeting, a
clearly angry Mr Kennedy described the Government's rail privatisation
plans as ''an incoherent shambles.''
But, Mr McLeish welcomed the BR board's decision to take time to
decide whether to appeal the sleeper issue.
Earlier this week, the Director of ScotRail Mr John Ellis said he
hoped the board would make an early decision.

THE Conservative Party was in turmoil last night with senior MPs
acknowledging that a leadership challenge to Mr John Major, now in
Canada at the G7 summit, was almost certain with pro and anti Europe MPs
at each other's throats.
The Government was also embarrassed by the revelation that Mr Dudley
Fishburn, Conservative MP for Kensington, had written a briefing note
for businessmen suggesting they would be wise to build contacts with Mr
Tony Blair's Labour Party.
Last night, the most senior Tory back benchers produced an almost
unprecedented document urging the Government to ''sharpen up'' its act
and setting out a programme of action.
Although calling for changes in most key policy areas, the paper,
drawn up by the most senior members of the executive of the 1922
Committee, which represents all Conservative back benchers, notably
urged the Government to stand firm in its opposition to major
constitutional change such as a Scottish Parliament.
But it pressed the Government to secure significant cuts in next
year's public spending to fund tax cuts in the November budget. It
called for special action to help home owners suffering from negative
equity and a much stiffer law and order policy, freeing the police from
some restrictions with tougher penalities for those found guilty by the
courts.
It came down significantly on the side of the Euro-sceptics,
suggesting that doubts about the way the European Union was developing
went well beyond the ranks of the politically active and proposing that
the Government took a firm stand to reverse trends towards European
centralism whatever other member states did.
It is highly unusual for the 22 executive to produce such specific
advice, which was arrived at after extensive polling of party opinion.
One senior Tory said the programme for action had to be adopted if panic
about Conservative prospects at the next election was not to set in.
In the Commons, the Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, a supporter of a
single European currency, heard his deputy, Mr Jonathan Aitken, Chief
Secretary, tell MPs that the prospect of it coming about was ''receding
into more distant and uncertain horizons''.
Minutes later, the Chancellor said a judgment could only be made
''when we see what the details are''.
Earlier, he enraged the Euro-sceptics by accusing them of
''xenophobia'' and ''behaving very badly'' when they met Mr Major on
Tuesday.
With tension steadily escalating, Euro-rebel Mr Tony Marlow said: ''We
are entering the end game. A challenge will happen in November''.
Mr Bill Walker, MP for Tayside North, said the possibility of a
challenge was ''more real than it had ever been''.
The threat to Mr Major came not just from the anti-Europeans but from
''all segements of the party'' where MPs were fearful of losing their
seats at the next election.
Senior Tory MPs said privately that one of the most worrying
developments was the disrespect with which many of the 50 MPs who met
the Prime Minister on Tuesday had treated him. One, who condemned it,
said it was none the less a sign of Mr Major's diminishing authority.
At a meeting of pro-EU Tories last night, Lord Plumb, leader of the
their MEPs, called the Euro-sceptics ''dishonest and disreputable''.
While close to open warfare was raging, Mr Fishburn's article, Winning
Over Labour, which briefed business and City executives, was greeted
jubilantly by the Opposition as implying that Labour would win the next
election.
He gave a rundown of useful Labour figures for business people to
cultivate, including the finance director who collects contributions to
the party.
The former executive editor of the Economist said: ''It is quite clear
that as business wants to map its interests over the next generation,
over the next 10 years, it must make its number with those people who
are on the front bench of the Labour Party.''
Mr Peter Mandelson, former Labour head of communications, now MP for
Hartlepool, said. ''This document is incredible. It shows how desperate
Tory MPs are for money even to the point of hiring themselves out to
introduce Labour MPs to business. This one is assuming that the next
Government will be a Labour one.''
The turmoil in the Tory ranks was reflected in an ICM poll for today's
Guardian which shows them trailing Labour by 39%.
It shows Labour on a massive 59% (56% last month), the Tories on just
20% (23%), Liberal Democrats on 18% (17%) and others on 4% (4%).
The poll was conducted among 1416 voters in 103 constituencies on June
9 and 10.
The Government suffered another setback last night when it was
defeated in the Lords over disabled rights. Peers backed a move to
broaden Ministers' plans to provide protection for the disabled against
discrimination.

<HEADLINE>Chinook widows' cash victory</HEADLINE>

DEFENCE chiefs are prepared to pay out compensation in excess of
#100,000 to each of the widows of the anti-terrorism experts killed in
an RAF helicopter crash due to pilot error, it was announced last night.
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said the Government accepted that
the #100,000 limit set by the Warsaw Convention on air crashes was out
of date.
''I confirm that the MoD will pay compensation to the next-of-kin
where this is due,'' he said.
Insurance companies which refused to pay out on claims for the deaths
of those on the Chinook may also be forced to make a U-turn.
One of the lawyers who met MoD officials on behalf of widows, Mr
Richard Barber, said he understood the ministry had taken senior
counsel's advice on the status of the flight and that he was of the
clear opinion that it was a civilian flight.
''If that is taken to be correct, then the insurance companies'
decision to refuse to compensate on the basis that it was a military
flight is untenable.''
The Royal Ulster Constabulary yesterday called for a speedy resolution
of the compensation issue.
''Only when these matters are resolved can the healing process truly
begin,'' said a statement from RUC headquarters.
A summary of the Defence Ministry's air accident investigation,
published yesterday, says pilot error was to blame for the crash.
The news that Government pay-outs would not be limited by the Warsaw
Convention was welcomed yesterday by the relieved widows.
Claims above the #100,000 figure would be considered taking account of
discussions on pay-outs within the civil airline business, Mr Rifkind
said.
''These discussions will inform, but not necessarily determine, the
Government's decision on whether the Chinook passenger claims should be
subject to an upper limit on compensation, and if so, at what higher
figure,'' he added.
Speaking on behalf of the widows, solicitor Aidan Canavan said in
Belfast: ''It is just very, very, very good news that the Government has
now indicated that they accept that the upper limit of #100,000 may be
breached, depending on the circumstances of each individual claim.''
The dead in the crash on the Mull of Kintyre included 10 RUC Special
Branch detectives, nine Army intelligence officers, five men and a woman
attached to the Northern Ireland Office -- some of them believed to be
from MI5 -- and a four-man crew.
