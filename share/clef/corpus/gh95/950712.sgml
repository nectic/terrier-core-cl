THERE can be few experiences more terrifying than being a passenger on
a runaway train.
Yet that was what faced a dozen sleepy travellers on yesterday's
6.15am from Glasgow as it smashed its way through the buffers at Largs
station.
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES HELPLESSLY PLUNGED INTO WHAT LOOKED LIKE THE
AFTERMATH OF A TERRORIST BOMBING
Luckily only five people suffered relatively minor injuries.
But how much worse it could have been.
Only the earliness of the hour prevented this becoming a major
disaster.
Vital questions must be answered quickly.
Was there human error?
Were the train's brakes at fault?
Is a failsafe mechanism needed?
GROWING CONGESTION ON THE ROADS IS FORCING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO USE
PUBLIC TRANSPORT.
But they must be confident of getting to their destination safely.

OUR nurses are being sold short yet again.
Renfrewshire Healthcare NHS Trust has shocked unions by insisting on
regrading.
THE PROPOSALS WOULD SEE NURSES LOSING OUT ON NATIONALLY AGREED PAY AND
CONDITIONS OF SERVUICE.
The unions say this is the only NHS Trust in Britain to act in this
way.
Statements that there are advantages for patient care have a hollow
ring.
This paper has fought for nurses rights and pay.
We say it again: 'Pay our nurses now, with no strings attached.'

Let us muse on the mews. What is that makes a tiny house set behind
larger townhouses such an attraction?
The history of the mews goes back a long way. A mew was a place where
royal hawks were kept, ready for the hunt. Eventually royal stables were
built on the site of the King's ''mews'' at Charing Cross in London.
Although the site had changed its use, the name stuck.
Mews became the word for staff living accommodation attached to
stables - and a surprising number of them are to be found in the lanes
behind the distinguished terraces of the Glasgow's West End.
They started life as servant's quarters, the place where the staff
slept over the stables before there were buses, trams, or an underground
line, and the gentry had to ride from the West End to the city centre.
Previously considered a downmarket address among the dustbins and
horsemanure, the mews has cantered into the affections of the public.
Single people, retired people, gays, and just about anyone else who is
childfree finds the mews an attractive place in which to live.
Purchasers should expect to get less space for their money than they
might expect in the surrounding townhouse, but they can look forward to
an intimate living space which has a charm all of its own. Look down
most lanes west of Byres Road and you will find a mews cottage.
Andy Goodearl of estate agents Euan Wallace is marketing a mews at 34
Grosvenor Lane which has a particularly attractive interior, with a
spiral staircase. The property has recently been extensively upgraded
and the accommodation consists of a reception hall, a magnificent
drawing room with many period features, a large main bedroom with
built-in wardrobes, a second double bedroom, a fitted kitchen, and
bathroom.
The shared courtyard is completely walled and has a concrete base and
well established shrub borders. Andy Goodearl says that it is ''perfect
for summer evening barbecues.''
The spacious main bedroom has three windows to the rear and the second
double bedroom has a window to the front.
Euan Wallace is looking for offers over #115,000.
Another mews at 32 Great Western Terrace lane is being marketed by
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison at a fixed price of #99,000. This is a rather rare
detached mews positioned behind the much admired Great Western Terrace,
by Alexander ''Greek'' Thomson.
The property , which has been recently fully developed, has a most
individual lay-out with two bedrooms on the ground floor and the
upstairs lounge and kitchen areas have a striking partially glazed
pitched roof (which is double glazed). The dining kitchen space is
fitted with cottage-style pine units and has a gas-fired Aga.
Estate agents Roy Slater also have a mews for sale at offers over
#49,950, a reduction on its original asking price of #58,500. Fortrose
Mews situated at 50 Fortrose Street in Partickhill is entirely detached
and set within Victorian villa grounds with the use of extensive
gardens.
The property, which was only recently rebuilt and restored comprises a
reception hall, utility store, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and sitting
room with views overlooking the West of Scotland Cricket Club grounds.

SUPPORTERS of 1000 Guineas winner Harayir have had to take the rough
with the smooth recently. Dick Hern's filly has been left gasping in the
wake of Ridgewood Pearl at the Curragh and Royal Ascot since her classic
triumph.
However, there is no such obvious obstacle to success in today's Child
Stakes at Newmarket.
When Harayir cruised through to make history on the Rowley Mile course
two months ago it looked as if the winner of the first Sunday classic to
be staged in Britain had the racing world at her feet.
She was made a hot favourite to follow up in the Irish 1000 Guineas,
where her poor run in fifth -- eight lengths behind the winner -- was
put down to the going being softer than Harayir would ideally like.
But even with fast ground at Ascot, she again could not cope with
Ridgewood Pearl.
Warning Shadows, a length and a quarter back in fourth that day, is
6lb better off here and is an obvious danger. But home gallops indicate
that Harayir is back to her brilliant best.
The lightly-raced Jalfrezi should be suited by both the track and the
distance of the Duke of Cambridge Handicap.

NINEWELLS Hospital in Dundee is to become the latest Scottish hospital
to fit electronic tags to babies in its maternity unit.
Their introduction was announced yesterday as a survey indicated that
electronic baby-tagging is being widely introduced in the NHS.
The survey, among hospitals in England and Wales, showed that 16% had
already installed baby-tagging and 37% were considering it. Those units
which did not want baby-tagging believed the system was ineffective, on
the grounds that tags could be removed.
Abductions from maternity hospitals are relatively rare but the two
which have occurred in recent times -- Abbie Humphreys in Nottingham
last year and Lydia Ownes from Glam Clwyd in Wales this year --
generated enormous publicity.
Many hospitals have installed security cameras, and the tags being
introduced at Ninewells will complement closed-circuit cameras already
installed at the hospital, as well as other security arrangements
introduced in consultation with the police.
These include a restriction on the number of visitors, and shift
change arrangements which ensure mothers know which midwife is in charge
of their case.
The report from the National Association of Health Authorities and
Trusts also highlighted the lack of security at many maternity units.
Law Hospital in Carluke was the first in Scotland to introduce
baby-tagging, and the Simpson Memorial in Edinburgh followed this up
with a pilot study.
The Vale of Leven Maternity Unit has recently introduced tagging.
Last month Stirling Royal started operating security cameras linked to
Central Scotland police.
A closed-circuit camera system is also in operation at Falkirk Royal's
maternity unit, and in the Royal Maternity in Glasgow.
Tagging has recently been introduced at the Queen Mother's Hospital in
Glasgow. A spokesman said: ''Someone who was determined enough could
find the tag and cut it off, but no system is foolproof. It is only part
of the picture. Every baby that leaves this hospital goes through the
door in the arms of a uniformed nurse or midwife, accompanied by the
parents. A baby leaving under any other circumstances would arouse
suspicion.''

FOR a tournament with a short history celebrating its 10th anniversary
this year the Scottish Open has caught the imagination and the interest
of golfers and spectators from all over Europe.
But the move last year from Gleneagles and the languid commentaries of
Peter Alliss to the much more demanding course at Carnoustie came as
something of a shock. But it could not have happened at a better time
for the tournament organisers, the players or the town. The Open at St
Andrews is just a week away and virtually just around the corner from
the Tayside venue.
The players seeking to practice on a links course could not have been
handed a better opportunity. And the spectators are being given a chance
to see some of the top names in world golf pit themselves against one of
the toughest courses in the world.
Charles Perring, the tournament director has been commuting to
Carnoustie for months and a few weeks ago moved his office into the
boardroom of the Links Management Committee in the town. There he has
been overseeing the building of the tented village, holding conferences
with senior police officers about traffic arrangments and parking,
seeking the best sites for the Sky television cameras and spectators and
tending to the thousands of details of organising a top modern golf
tournament.
He is delighted that the championship, which re-launched from small
beginnings back to prominence at Haggs Castle in Glasgow and then moved
to Gleneagles, has come to the east coast town. But the most astute move
his company made 10 years ago was to insist the Scottish Open was given
the week before The Open as its date slot on the European tour. That was
a huge attraction for top players converging from all over the world to
Britain for The Open. And now Carnoustie.
''Gleneagles was an outstanding venue but what it lacked was, perhaps,
the quality in each of its 18 holes to bring the best out of the field
we managed to compile every year.'' he said.
''It is a testimony to the Carnoustie course that it can be judged by
the quality of the field that has entered. The timing was just perfect
for the move here.''
And the condition of the course was a great factor as well. Charles
Perring is another who is full of praise for the links superintendent
John Philp. ''He is full of good ideas to counteract the improvement in
the technology and equipment of the modern day game.
''It has great flexibility and has all the armour needed to protect
itself from the top modern day professionals.''
Charles Perring, like the Carnoustie experts, knows that courses can
be semi-defenceless on calm days but if a wind blows a score of 72 will
be reckoned to be very good over this links.
But the course is fair and hasn't been ''tricked up'' to produce low
scores.
The tournament has grown enormously in status in the past 10 years.
Prize money now stands at #650,000. It is Ryder Cup qualifying. It has
an exemption for five players into The Open. And it is probably the best
publicly attended event on the European Tour apart from The Open.
The loss of the sponsorship deal with Bells whisky company was
obviously a blow. ''But it allowed us to think of a new way forward.''
said Charles Perring.
''For instance, the title is now big enough to stand on its own and
perhaps in the future we may have a 'presenting sponsor'. It will become
The Scottish Open presented by ... and the name of the sponsor.
''Obviously that won't bring in as much money but it will bring in
enough to keep prize money increasing over the years''
But Charles Perring's company knows the Scottish Open is now a great
brand name and a great product. And they will go on from there.
Facts and figures

CELTIC'S international midfielder John Collins, who claimed after the
Scottish Cup final that he had played his last game for the club, will
still be with them at the start of the season after talks between the
#3m-rated player, his agent, and Celtic manager Tommy Burns.
During the summer, Collins has been surrounded by intense speculation
about his future following his suggestion that the Parkhead career he
embarked upon five years ago was over.
Newly promoted Middlesbrough had made a bid for the highly-skilled
playmaker, who joined Celtic from Hibs for #1m. But the #2m offer from
Boro manager Bryan Robson fell far short of the valuation placed upon
the player.
And yesterday, after an increased offer from Middlesbrough and another
from Queens Park Rangers, which matched that at #2.25m, Celtic decided
Collins would stay.
Burns announced simply: ''We informed John and his agent of the two
offers we have received. As far as this club was concerned, both were
given a negative response. That is the matter over.''
However, if Celtic were to be offered a fee which comes closer to
their valuation of Collins, then the player could yet be sold.
While Burns still ponders the complicated transfer market, Motherwell
manager Alex McLeish spent #200,000 to bring John Hendry back to
Scotland from Spurs.
Dundee United wanted to take the one time Dens Park player back to
Tayside, but McLeish moved in first and last night he said: ''John has
been five years with Spurs, learning his trade alongside top players
such as Gary Lineker and Jurgen Klinsmann. He will give us something
extra up front and we know that we need a player with his kind of
experience in Europe.''
Added Hendry: ''It is a move which appealed to me because I am joining
a club who finished second in the premier division last season and who
are playing in the UEFA Cup in the season coming up.''
Meanwhile, at Aberdeen, utility player Paul Kane has been made
available for transfer after four years with the club. He cost #200,000
when he returned from Oldham after a spell with the Lancashire club
following a transfer from HIbs.
Said Manager Roy Aitken:''I have spoken to Paul today and told him the
situation. We will listen to offers -- but he is the only player we are
allowing to leave the club.
''I have started talks with Scott Booth and these will continue later
this week with him and his agent. We want him to remain at Pittodrie.
''As for the speculation surrounding Eoin Jess you can forget that.
Heis under contract here, and that is that.''

MANY famous names in golf have been favoured or frustrated over the
world-renowned Carnoustie Championship links. The names read like a list
from golf's Hall of Fame. Tommy Armour, Bobby Jones, Byron Nelson, Henry
Cotton, and in more modern times, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary
Player and Tom Watson have all faced the rigours of this course.
But only one has become a legend.
His name is Ben Hogan.
Older locals talk about his triumph here in 1953 as if it were just
yesterday. Stories about his meticulous attention to practice and detail
are legion.
It is a fact that he ''borrowed'' the 17th green on the nearby Barry
course to hone his putting for the championship.
He asked permission to cut the green to the standard he believed he
would be facing on the championship course.
The green staff offered to cut it any way he wanted but the slight
American turned them down. He took out the hand mower, spent hours
cutting the green himself and then returned the mower to the shed. He
even cleaned off the blades before he put it away.
Then he putted hundreds of balls from every angle and from every
slope, undulation and borrow on his green.
Hogan was the kind of man who practised his game in all conditions.
When other professionals stayed in the clubhouse when it was raining the
Texan from Fort Worth was on the course in his waterproofs learning how
the clubs and ball would react in wet conditions.
At Carnoustie he learned every route into every green and had the game
to pit his strengths against the course.
At the long 6th hole there is a narrow area of fairway to the left of
two bunkers which is known as ''Hogan's Alley.'' No other professional
would have dreamed of using that line for a drive. It was too dangerous.
Yet the American drove into it in every one of the four rounds. There is
a story that in his last round he played from the same divot mark he had
made in the morning.
An older member who watched Hogan recalled that his driving from the
tee was nothing spectacular until he needed a long one. ''Then he hit
the ball 50 or 60 yards past his partners. He was phenomenal.''
Ben Hogan is now 84 and rarely stirs away from his home near his
beloved Shady Oaks golf club in Fort Worth. But he recalls his triumph
at Carnoustie vividly. And Joe McClory, owner of the Glencoe Hotel only
a few yards from the course can testify to that. He named his restaurant
and bar Hogan's Alley after the feat of the American golfer.
Now he treasures a personal letter from Ben Hogan and signed by him
from his company headquarters in Fort Worth thanking him and saying how
important the 6th hole was to him when he won his championship.
Earlier this year Mike Wright, the head professional at Shady Oaks in
Fort Worth visited Carnoustie and played the course. During a chat with
Martin Roy, the caddy master, he recalled that he had asked his boss how
he would like to be remembered.
''As a gentleman,'' replied Ben Hogan. ''As a gentleman.''

SCOTLAND'S three successes at the weekend, when Sam Torrance won in
Ireland, Kathryn Marshall in the United States, and the national amateur
team in Belgium, was surely without precedent -- and a welcome and
appropriate sequel would now be another victory, on home soil, in the
Scottish Open championship.
Moreover, it would not be before time, since on nine previous
occasions the title has migrated to England, Wales, Ireland, Australia
and Sweden. Perhaps the change of scene to the sternly Caledonian links
of Carnoustie from the gentler pastures of Haggs Castle and Gleneagles
Hotel will prove to be inspirational.
The dilemma lies in identifying realistic candidates, not only because
of the strength of the challenge offered by professionals from the other
countries on the European Tour, but because there is a substantial
contingent of overseas players powerful enough to upset domestic
ambitions.
After all, it would be a little much to ask of Torrance to win in
successive weeks. Colin Montgomerie is in a period of his career when he
is finding ways not to win; and Sandy Lyle's game seems to prosper like
an illness in remission.
Torrance has declared his objective now as winning this year's
European Order of Merit, something Montgomerie has achieved for the last
two years but which, in 25 years on the Tour, Torrance has never done.
In that quarter-century his highest finishes have been second once and
third twice.
There is #650,000 in prize money available this week and #1.25m in the
ensuing Open Championship, and Torrance, now second on the table two
places ahead of Montgomerie, could more than consolidate his lead.
However, Montgomerie has one advantage over these next four days which
few of the other professionals possess -- he has played the course
competitively.
True that was as an amateur in the 1986 Scottish Strokeplay
championship and, according to Montgomerie's coach, Bill Ferguson, he
remembered only some of the holes. But Montgomerie's experience was not
comparable to that of Nick Faldo, who as an 18-year-old tried, but
failed, to qualify at Monifieth for the 1975 Open.
Yet he has fond remembrances of Carnoustie, since he walked with Lee
Trevino for three practice rounds -- ''and he didn't miss a green for
the first two and a half of them,'' he recalled. Now, after a three-week
break since his disappointing finish in the US Open, Faldo is about to
play in only his second European tournament this year.
Also, his presence ensures a musical charity of a minimum of #30,000,
which would have been the championship organisers appearance fee to him.
In advance of the Open Faldo hopes he will not be be drained by the
7187-yard course ''that's so long and tough'' or ''have to fight too
heavy a wind.'' Yesterday, 16 holes were enough.
Faldo's assessment of the examination was that downwind on the hard
fairways 25 to 30 yards of run had to be taken into account -- ''and
that's just with the wedges.'' Conversely, he needed two drivers to
reach the 512-yard fourteenth and the 459-yard fifteenth, and yet
another from the tee at the 235-yard sixteenth.
Lyle, who at Bernard Gallacher's behest played yesterday with Stephen
Gallacher, the Ryder Cup captain's nephew, and the amateur champion
Gordon Sherry, made a previous acquaintance with the links in the less
exacting circumstances of a company day some seven years ago.
''This is more of a man's course and this championship won't be a
putting contest,'' Lyall observed with all the satisfaction of a man who
knows where his weakness lies. ''Shoot par and you could advance 20
places -- and my caddie advises me that I'm only 6000 practice balls
away from perfection.''
The withdrawals of Jose Maria Olazabal, because of his foot injury,
and of Peter Jacobsen, for personal reasons, are disappointing. But
apart from Ben Crenshaw the American challenge is reinforced by Davis
Love and an interesting newcomer in David Duval, a former Walker Cup
player who is this season's leading rookie money-winner.
Mark Roe is a doubtful starter. He, like Olazabal, missed the Irish
Open and has now been told he needs a knee operation to remove some
floating bone.
''It's killing me, but if I think I can play I will give it a go,'' he
said.
A nostalgic link with the past at Carnoustie finally is forged by the
presence of Tommy Armour III, whose grandfather, Edinburgh born but by
then an American citizen, in 1931 won the first of the five Open
Championships to have been played so far over the Angus course.
* COLIN Montgomerie has been backed at 150-1 to win this week's
Scottish Open at Carnoustie and next week's Open Championship at St
Andrews.
According to Ladbrokes, a fan has placed a bet of #500 on the Scot to
land the double and stands to collect #75,000 if he succeeds.
* AMERICAN Lee Janzen will be leaning more than ever on his British
caddie, Dave Musgrove, at St Andrews next week.
The former US Open champion is making his first trip to the home of
golf, whereas Musgrove's first Open at the course was way back in 1964.
''Lee is like a kid waiting to get a new toy,'' said the
Nottinghamshire caddie, who was with Seve Ballesteros when he won at
Lytham in 1979 and carried Sandy Lyle's bag when he became champion at
Sandwich six years later.

James Laing meets a man who spends more time on the fairways than the
most hardened professional
JOHN Philp is the Links Superintendent of the Carnoustie Championship
Course and a hard man to stop in his tracks.
He is all over the course every day supervising work on what purists
claim to be the finest links course in Scotland and one of the top ten
golf courses in the United Kingdom.
He keeps in touch with his office on a radio telephone holstered on
his left hip like a six-gun and works longer hours than anyone else in
this golf-mad town his admirers claim.
It is a fact that shortly after 6am guests in the Glencoe, the last
hotel on Links Parade a few yards from the last green, are awakened by
the rattle and bang of tractors hauling spraying equipment over greens
or gang mowers over the fairways of the championship course.
In the last year John Philp and his green keeping staff have revetted
and re-modelled 91 bunkers on the course. They have built five new tees
and improved many more.
They have created spectator mounds where the thousands of visitors may
stand to watch the top players in the game play their shots to
immaculate greens. The mounds are brand new but look like they have been
there for years.
The green staff have nurtured, fed, and cossetted greens and the
fairways of this great course for the last ten years and for a future
which has suddenly arrived.
Chris Smith, Captain of the Carnoustie Golf Club, said: ''If Jock
Calder, the chairman of the links management committee is the man of the
moment in Carnoustie by persuading the Scottish Open people and the R &amp;
A to bring their top events back to the town then the second most
important man is John Philp.''
It was John Philp who pointed out to the links management committee
that something had to be done to increase the degree of difficulty at
Carnoustie to cope with the improvement in equipment and skills afforded
to the modern players.
When Gary Player won his Open in 1968 he did so with a four round
score of 289 -- one over par -- and it was hailed as a magnificent
achievement in the circumstances.
A few years later a young amateur called David Gilford, now a ranking
professional, won a youth championship with a four round aggregate of
283 which was six shots better than Player achieved to win the Open.
''We haven't tricked it up to make it more difficult. We have just set
a more testing examination of the professionals' game,'' said John.
''Besides, they are playing a shortened version of the real thing.''
It was a wry and humorous comment about the decision of the tournament
organisers of the Scottish Open to shorten the devastatingly difficult
12th hole for from more than 475 yards to a more amenable 405 yards.
''Mebbe they thought the pros would need a wee breather,'' chuckled
John.
He and his team look after three courses at Carnoustie but the
championship course is the biggest asset for tourism and prestige the
town and the region can boast and the right man is taking care of it.

RIGHT in London's West End, 20 senior Scottish stalwarts have pulled
out all the stops to present an impressive show of lively, colourful
paintings. All are members of the Royal Glasgow Institute and most have
close links with Glasgow School of Art as graduates and/or teachers. The
result is a good overview of mainstream West Coast style.
For someone who holds the august title of Her Majesty's Limner In
Scotland, David Donaldson retains a nicely wry, off-beat approach with a
nubile nude, bespectacled, pullover chap and dog providing Light in Our
Darkness.
David Michie has a similarly quirky sense of things, so that menacing,
Sutherlandesque insects like Mantis, Moth and Cricket People, in his
abstracted gardens rather eclipse the blue, purple and red petalled
blooms. The resulting sweet and sour mix, carried out with a light
touch, is irresistible.
Edgar's family portraits, Squire's Testa Rossa, Dunbar's Harbour
Village a la Alan Davie, Forrest's Chinese scenes, Balmer's very pretty
Flowers Posing, Blackadder's Primulas, and MacQueen's orange and black
calligraphy, contribute variety while lush landscapes include
Cunningham's County Kerry, Houston's Bass Rock, Scouller's North African
palm trees, Wright's wonderful grainy textured Kintyre rocks and
shoreline plus Low's minimalist Jura.
The only Scottish sculpture, Vincent Butler's very fine bronze female
figures, is rather spoiled by the addition of grotesque carved yew tree
roots by someone called Richard Chapman, who is absolutely nothing to do
with Scotland or the RGI.

THE next interest rate meeting between the Chancellor and the Governor
of the Bank of England takes place on July 27 but already every economic
statistic is being examined meticulously to see if there is any clear
outcome obvious in advance. The last decision not to raise interest
rates in May was seen as a fine one which could have gone either way.
The Chancellor, by insisting on holding the line then, was at first
assailed by most financial opinion, but he has been vindicated so far by
the way in which events have confirmed his judgment. He maintained his
stance last month and may do so again at the end of this month. He has
every political reason to do so -- another rise would be bound to affect
mortgage rates and worsen the health of what is at best a convalescent
housing market. It would also damage business, particularly medium and
small-sized companies with substantial borrowings. It is not an academic
debate but the Chancellor has been able to show that he was not acting
previously merely in the partisan interests of his colleagues. The
trouble is that the data as they arrive are sending contradictory
signals still. Output figures suggest that underlying inflationary
pressures remain strong, which will support the Governor who is expected
to maintain his earlier stance which is that a small upwards movement
now will prevent the need for a larger one later. The economy, however,
has shown signs of slowing down quite dramatically, which confirms Mr
Clarke's view that dearer money has already had its desired effect; any
more might bring growth to a halt, evoking memories of the stop-go years
of the early 1960s.
Mr Clarke should stand firm again, at least on the balance of the
evidence so far. He retains the ability to alter his stance should the
evidence become more decisive in the direction he prefers not to move,
and although meetings can be held at regular intervals there is no
reason for imagining that policy decisions need conform to their
timetable, though markets often suppose that moves which catch them
unawares suggest the monetary authorities have panicked, a strange
reaction which just has to be lived with. In fact the international
scene has witnessed some important downwards shifts in interest rates
which are bound to nudge us in the same direction since they include
important trading partners in the US and the rest of the European Union,
though not yet Germany. These movements lend some support to those who
hope that our own next interest rate movement could be down: more
certainly any upwards movement is likely to be modest and should be the
last in the present cycle. Mr Clarke's opinion that we may be close to
the peak no longer looks over optimistic.
Interpreting the evidence so far suggests that any exchanges between
the Chancellor and the Governor at the end of the month could be quite
sharp. There is no point in denying that the Chancellor is also a
politician (and a very ambitious one) and that political calculation
cannot be removed from his thinking. But another way of putting that is
to notice that he is accountable to Parliament immediately and to the
people at one remove. It should qualify rather than disqualify our
leaders that they have to remember the rest of us. Were national affairs
capable of being run by wise and detached minds free to assess trends
and realities in a disinterested way it might be fine and well, but it
would not be democratic (and experience tends to show it would hardly be
fine and well either). Right so far, the Chancellor deserves the benefit
of any doubt available now.

WITH five years to go, the race is already on to find the perfect
embodiment of fin de siecle sensibility. The Tate Gallery throws its cap
into thering with an exhibition, Rites of Passage: Art for the End of
the Century, and it works well, although topicality counts for much in
this game and these works, inevitably, risk being superseded.
The whole angst-ridden shooting-match is here: identity, gender,
sexuality, ageing, Aids, and of course, death. But although it is a
profoundly arresting show, it does not go for vulgar effects and it is
not an exclusively gloomy vision that is presented.
Eleven international artists are represented by works that have been
produced in the past decade; some of them very recent. The first room
sets the tone with a series of photographic self-portraits by John
Coplans. The larger than life-size black and white images spare no
intrusion into his naked body in order to explore the process of ageing
(Coplans is in his seventies).
Mona Hatoum also uses her own body as the point of departure for Corps
etranger (Foreign Body). The techniques of coloscopy and endoscopy
present a journey through the interior of her body, accompanied by
recordings of its interior sounds.
The pair of installations by Louise Bourgeois, the Red Rooms, are
imaginative recreations of spaces from her own childhood in the 1920s.
Between heavy wooden doors, we can glimpse two bedrooms -- her own and
that of her parents. In forcing us into the position of voyeur,
Bourgeois suggests both a claustrophobia and a barely repressed
sexuality.
Jana Sterbak's Vanitas, Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic is made
from great squares of steak, stitched together on a tailor's dummy. The
work by the Spanish artist, Pepe Espaliu, who died from an Aids-related
illness in 1993, is profoundly moving. Untitled, three birdcages strung
up high under the gallery's ceiling, are left open at the bottom with
their ends cascading over the floor, like wiry roots. The ambiguity of
the work perfectly captures the mood of the show, perhaps even of the
century.
Rites of Passage: Art for the End of the Century is at the Tate
Gallery, London, to September 3.

''REGRETS, I've had a few,'' might be Madame Ranyevskaya's swan-song
to this, Chekhov's most popular and luminous play about class,
attachment to the old and a society on the brink of change -- though in
Adrian Noble's clever, elegant new RSC production (taken from Peter
Gill's version that was such a personal triumph 15 years ago), it is
Lopakhin, the son of a former serf who stands at its centre -- in David
Troughton's mesmerising performance, a terrifying symbol of the
transference of power to a new order.
The master stroke of Noble's production, however is using all levels
of the wooden-beamed Swan stage. It's as if the timbered stage itself
had taken on the heartbeat of a house. When the estate is sold, a
cacophany of suitcases, galoshes, and pillows come hurtling from the
upper stories. Chaos, Noble has clearly decided, is the other side of
indolence and fecklessness as, in the second act, unruly mayhem builds,
led by Jewish musicians (for once this is a real kletzmer band) to
Lopakhin's traumatic announcement that he has bought the Cherry Orchard.
Noble creates a bustling household of egotists and well-meaning
buffoons but in the end this Cherry Orchard belongs to the opportunists
-- to Lopakhin and the sullen servant, Yasha, given a ferocious, dark
resentment by Mark Lockyer. For all that, this enjoyable production
remains lightweight and only superficially moving.

IF ever there was a play for our times, Julius Caesar is it. The most
penetrating of plays about political skulduggery and democracy, it could
hardly be more topical coming, as it does, in the wake of the recent
leadership contest. Directed, too by Peter Hall, at his best still a
director of the keenest political awareness, the prospect was
mouth-watering.
In the event, Hall's return to Stratford's main stage, scene of so
many directorial triumphs in the sixties is a disappointment, though it
certainly proves he's lost none of his sense of stagecraft. Designed by
John Gunter as though auditioning for MGM, everything about this Rome is
a monumental scale from its imposing imperial heads and giant staircases
to its heraldic flying buttresses.
Hall swathes the conspirators in blood-red robes, and dresses Hugh
Quarshie's Mark Antony (implied intially as perhaps a bit of a toyboy to
Christopher Benjamin's flatulent Caesar) in a pure white silk tunic.
Although visually striking, the crowd scenes lack dynamism and
conviction despite being augmented by 50 good citizens of Stratford. One
never gets the sense of mob rule barely kept in check.
And though the initial scenes with Julian Glover's eagle-eyed,
peacock-proud Cassius and John Nettles's opaque Brutus strike
fascinating sparks of intrigue, and the assassination is all too
bloodily real, much is but sketchily implied.
The production misses the ebbs and flows of friendship, argument,
character and political self-justification that make this, far from the
dry, dull straw of school rote, one of the most urgent and insightful of
political dramas.

The new Scottish Secretary's talk of increased powers and spending for
unitary local authorities has intrigued councillors, and created
suspicion among many, Frances Horsburgh discovers
WHAT is Michael Forsyth up to? Has Mr Poll Tax really learnt to love
councils and all their works? Is it all a Machiavellian plot to sabotage
a Scottish parliament or does he simply favour giving local, largely
Labour, councils enough financial rope to hang themselves? The questions
are bouncing off the walls of council corridors throughout Scotland.
Not only has the new Scottish Secretary wrong-footed much of the media
by adopting a new persona which seems to have come straight out of the
old Rank charm school, but the arch apostle of Thatcherism has also set
local government buzzing with his talk of strengthening the powers of
councils.
He has been in the Scottish Office for less than a week but already he
has brandished olive branches at political opponents, including those in
local government. There have been suggestions he could lend a
sympathetic ear to removing restraints on council spending, might
consider giving more economic power to the new authorities, and wants to
make quangos more accountable.
Is it simply a case of the smile on the face of the tiger? Council
leaders are intrigued but remain highly sceptical of the new man's
motives.
The Labour-dominated Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was due
to meet that master of the dead bat, Ian Lang, on July 24 to discuss a
range of matters.
They never seemed able to make much headway against Lang's mixture of
blandness and briskness at these statutory gatherings, and usually found
themselves outside on the street again fairly sharpish.
Now they will face the more plain-speaking but, so far,
anxious-to-listen Michael Forsyth. A great opportunity, says Cosla's
Labour senior vice-president, Keith Geddes, to press him further on a
number of these matters.
Councillor Geddes has already challenged Forsyth, as a pledge of good
faith over quangos, to ensure that the three new water authorities are
run by a majority of elected members, preferably nominated by councils
rather than by himself.
Almost before his feet touched the carpet at St Andrew's House, the
new Scottish Secretary told the press he was looking at the composition
of the water authorities -- an announcement was imminent when he took
over.
It may be difficult for him to make much significant change at this
stage. Labour councillors have refused to serve on the boards of the
authorities and unnamed Tory councillors and others have agreed to join.
Tory councillor Ian Drysdale, who will lead the opposition in the new
East Renfrewshire council, emphasises that his colleagues in the
Scottish Association of Conservative Councillors favour strong local
government. Like Forsyth, what they don't want is a centralised
parliamentary body in Edinburgh.
''Michael Forsyth is a fighter and he is speaking our language,'' he
says. Councillor Drysdale thinks the Scottish Office should take another
look to see if there are any other powers which can realistically be
transferred to the new unitary councils.
Back in 1975, Labour Environment Secretary Anthony Crosland famously
declared that local government's spending party was over. But he was
heralding a cut in grants, not a capping limit on councils' ability to
raise taxes.
New Labour has promised to end capping, but could Forsyth be about to
beat them to it. Interestingly, John Redwood, not a million miles away
from Michael Forsyth ideologically, included this pledge in his
leadership manifesto against John Major. Such a move would be welcomed
by many Tory members.
One activist said: ''Forsyth's scenario is simple. He doesn't believe
the Labour Party has changed its spots. They are high spenders, and he
wants to give them the chance to do that.
''Without capping, the voters won't be saved from the full impact on
their pockets of Labour policies. He wants to give them enough rope to
hang themselves before the next council polls in 1999.''
Two leading academic observers of the Scottish local government scene
are as intrigued as the politicians over the new Scottish Secretary's
real intentions towards local government.
Professor Arthur Midwinter, of Strathclyde University, says: ''I would
regard his personal position as ideologically hostile to local
government. There is his advocacy of the poll tax, his previous attacks
on municipal provision and high-spending councils.''
The professor is not convinced that the Conservatives would gain any
electoral advantage by removing the present capping constraints on
council spending.
With central government now controlling, through grants and the level
of business rates, about 85% of council spending, he believes the blame
for council tax rises and cutbacks on service spending could still be
laid at the Government's door.
But putting political advantage aside, he believes very strongly that
a removal of capping would be crucial in helping achieve a smooth
transition to the new unitary councils. It would ease what he believes
is a serious threat of more council jobs than expected being lost
through a reorganisation conducted against a background of a
public-spending squeeze.
He sees no reason why the new Scottish Secretary could not use the
''Taking Stock'' initiative to seek to abolish capping in Scotland
without waiting for England and Wales to follow suit. The Treasury,
however, would have to be convinced.
As Cosla deputy secretary and finance expert Albert Tait points out,
the Secretary of State could simply not announce 1996-7 capping limits
covering all councils in November, but could warn instead that if he
regarded any authority as behaving in a profligate fashion he would
resort to using his selective powers to intervene.
Grants for councils would not be increased as a result but they would
be free to raise their council taxes to levels they thought appropriate
and spend reserves if they wished.
Professor Alan Alexander, also of Strathclyde University, says: ''I
think what he is saying has a lot to do with Mr Forsyth setting out his
stall against any sort of Scottish parliament or assembly.''
Part of the strategy would be to exploit the suspicions of some Labour
councillors that a Scottish parliament would suck up their local powers.
Strengthening the position of the new councils would make them appear
even more worthy of defending against a possibly acquisitive parliament.
If the new Scottish Secretary were indeed trying to reduce the
democratic deficit over quangos, it would not be too difficult for him
to nominate more elected councillors on to their boards, said the
professor. But it would be ''an enormous concession'' for him to give up
his right to appoint whom he chose and guarantee to accept nominations
from councils, as Cosla wished, for the new water authorities.
He believed the practicalities of putting into effect some of the
other initiatives he was reputed to be considering, such as linking the
local economic development companies to the economic development
departments of the new unitary councils to increase their democratic
control, would be extremely complex.
Many of the new Scottish Secretary's old right-wing political
associates in Scotland are as perplexed as anyone about his new, and
apparently still-emerging, stance. But they are loyally determined to
keep the faith -- once they know exactly what it is.

DAY TWO of the Scottish Youth Dance Festival and energy levels have
gone way off the Richter scale. The RSAMD is simply seething with an
upbeat enthusiasm which made the evening performance go with an extra
zing -- and that was only the audience! The ready cheers and bursts of
clap-along solidarity gave a nice informality to things, made the
showing of work take on a spirit of real sharing -- which is, after all,
one of the key elements in the SYDF.
So, what did we share? A marvellously bizarre, bright, tightly
choreographed piece from Gloucestershire Youth Dance Company that had
the dancers in odd shoes. High heels on one foot, clumpy boots on
t'other. From there it gathered momentum, turned flirty, silly, fast,
and fluent . . . without ever overdoing the deadpan humour or losing
sight of strong dance moves.
And we had an utterly delicious display of step dancing by tutor Mat
Melins -- neat, sly footwork full of shifting rhythms, done at a
cracking pace. Brilliant. Hints of heel'n'toe and reel settings in
Shetland Rock, a first-time appearance at the festival by the island's
Sound Youth Group in a work that balanced traditional echoes with
contemporary steps. I suppose there were glimpses of step dance, too, in
the street-strut/aerobic style of DIMA (Dance Islay Mid Argyll) in their
cheerful high-energy piece, Freedom.
Both Projekt 11:92 and Dundee Rep Youth Dance Company explored inner
feelings and outer tensions. The Dundee girls focused on the cruelty and
violence that can lurk inside the young, and as a voice whispered
''Though I'm small, I'm nasty too'' they enacted sudden acts of bullying
and terror -- a dark, atmospheric, and interestingly disquieting piece.
The mixed ability group in A Declaration (Projekt 11:92) voiced needs
and determined self-worth while dancing out moments of loneliness,
anger, and ultimate support with noticeable conviction and passion.
Inner and outer selves were at the heart of Denny Dance Theatre's
haunting, poetic piece My Self Unseen, while another tutor on the
course, Alan Greig, offered a solo from his recent work, Red, that
flagged up both the naughty wit and fluid dance that he is contributing
to participants in the festival.
With work like this around, no wonder the joint is jumping at the
RSAMD.

Northern Ireland may be almost one year into its
truce, but the Portadown confrontation shows that
peace is no nearer, argues Steve Bruce
JULY in Northern Ireland is always tense, but this year's marching
season -- the first since the ceasefires -- was always going to be
unusually difficult. The London and Dublin strategy for managing the
peace process has relied on ambiguity. Each side has been encouraged to
hear what it wants to hear. There had to come a time when the competing
interpretations of what was being promised would clash. The Orange
parades provided that occasion.
Parading has always played a big part in Ulster's conflict. The
present Troubles began in 1968 with marches and blockades. The students
of the Civil Rights Association dramatised their claims that Catholics
were victims of discrimination in a sectarian state by walking from
Belfast to Londonderry on a route deliberately chosen to pass through
strongly loyalist areas. They got the backlash and the publicity they
desired.
Unionists have always insisted that no part of the Queen's realm
should be a ''no-go'' area for her loyal subjects, and the Orange
pantheon gives pride of place to men who have refused to accept public
order bans on controversial parades. Ian Paisley often cites the example
of William Johnston of Ballykillbegs, who in 1866 defied a ban on
parading, was sent to prison, and emerged to be elected to Parliament as
a popular Protestant hero.
For months now, nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland and in
Dublin have been arguing that the new dispensation in Ulster should be
signalled by a complete ban on coat-trailing parades. Unionists have
countered by insisting that the Government should prove it has made no
secret deal with the IRA by upholding the democratic right of the
law-abiding majority to walk anywhere in the province. The stage was
thus set for a test of Government intentions, and Portadown provided it.
This is not the first time that Portadown has been the setting for
clashes between Orangemen and the police force that loyalists now call
the ''SS-RUC''. In the aftermath of the November 1985 signing of the
British-Irish agreement, the Apprentice Boys of Derry called a march
through the nationalist ''Tunnel'' area of Portadown. The RUC blocked
the route and in the violence that followed made history by adding their
first Protestant victim to the long list of Catholics killed with
plastic baton rounds. Just last month the parents of Keith White asked
local loyalists not to repaint the mural which commemorated his death.
They said they could no longer bear to be daily reminded of their
tragedy.
If ambiguity is one plank of the Government's strategy, inertia is
another. The failure of previous political initiatives has taught the
dangers of rushing into action. London and Dublin published the broad
outlines of where they want Northern Ireland to go and then shifted into
low gear. Do not rush into anything that requires elections. Do not give
politicians easy opportunities to grandstand. Hold ponderous talks about
talks. Let people get used to peace and hope that every month that
passes increases the community pressure on the gunmen to stay silent.
Easy may not do it, but nothing else will.
And then came the release of Private Lee Clegg. Whatever the merits of
the case, his astonishingly early release -- four years for a crime that
has brought hundreds of men more than 10 years, and some men 20 years,
in prison -- was guaranteed to provoke anger and not just on the
nationalist side.
The Loyalist Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force
have about 200 men serving long sentences for terrorist offences. On
both sides the prisoners played a large part in brokering the
ceasefires. Every long-term prisoner is part of a circle of family,
friends and neighbours who have added their weight to the ceasefires in
the hope of early releases.
The first frustrated responses to the Clegg release came in street
demonstrations in nationalist areas, but loyalist leaders have added
their voices to the clamour of outrage. Billy Hutchinson, of the
Progressive Unionists, a fringe party close to the UVF, has for a year
been arguing that Unionists should not over-react to the Government's
supposed intentions for the province. Last week he said that loyalist
paramilitaries were beginning to question the value of talking to the
Government ''if we can't even get a single prisoner out''.
So the ingredients of an explosive mix were in place. Nationalists are
frustrated at the lack of progress on talks with Sinn Fein and on the
release of prisoners. Loyalists share the frustration over the
prisoners. The wider Unionist community resents talks of peace and
political progress when there has been no commitment by the IRA to
disarm. Add the Orange Order's insistence on marching through a
nationalist area of Portadown, where 10 years ago similar circumstances
led to the RUC killing a young Protestant, and the result was
predictable.
There is some comfort to be drawn from the fact that no-one died: no
new face for a commemorative mural. After the initial skirmishes and
almost two days of negotiation, a solution was found. The nationalists
allowed the RUC to move them from the road and formed silent and
reproachful lines down each pavement. The Orangemen dropped the
triumphalist band music and, like a funeral procession, marched in
silence down the Garvaghy Road.
That settlement could stand as a metaphor for the present state of
community relations in Northern Ireland. After a year of truce, peace
seems no nearer. Kept apart by the police, two bodies of people pass
each other in silent and sullen resentment and hatred.

ONE of the unresolved questions in Scottish politics is whether
Michael Forsyth really was a member of the Labour Club in his first year
at St Andrews University. At 20 years distance I can't remember one way
or the other. It has always seemed to me a tad unlikely. While the young
Michael might have fitted into Blair's ''new'' Labour easily enough,
back in 1974 the Labour students were a sharper shade of red.
However, it is the case that Michael has been fond of pointing up that
his early political leanings were in a leftward direction. ''The left
had all the ideas,'' he is reported as saying.
It is highly appropriate therefore that one of the first tests faced
by the new Scottish Secretary should be his response to what was
originally a left-wing idea -- nursery vouchers.
The left-wing rationale for nursery vouchers was that children from
deprived backgrounds would carry higher-value vouchers to even out the
opportunity for all children.
From what we have seen of the proposed scheme for south of the Border
the Tories intend to turn that on its head. It looks like the English
scheme will actually favour the better off. Indeed a close look at
Scottish requirements casts doubt on whether any voucher scheme can be
effective north of the Border.
The key problem in Scotland is a lack of nursery places. We have a
smaller proportion of publicly funded places than the rest of the UK,
which in itself is the poor relation of Europe.
It is highly questionable whether a voucher system can guarantee to
create a single new nursery place, build a single new nursery school, or
train a single new nursery teacher. Of course it will do nothing for
three-year-olds, where lack of provision is particularly acute.
Recent official figures on early years' services also show a drop in
the number of local authority day care places for the first time in 15
years as local authorities struggle with budget restrictions.
To put it in economic terms the problem is not just one of demand but
of supply, and merely increasing the demand by printing vouchers will
not necessarily bring the supply magically into existence.
That applies in particular to rural Scotland and areas of substantial
urban disadvantage. The Western Isles, for example, does not have a
single publicly-funded nursery place. That is not likely to be changed
with a voucher worth less than the cost of nursery provision.
There is thus a clear danger of a two-tier system emerging with
pressure on some parents to top up the vouchers and go private while
other parents who cannot afford the additional cost are ghettoised in an
underfunded state sector.
The pressure to top-up what the public sector offers is already strong
in the health service. Do we really want to see it institutionalised
into nursery provision? Four years old seems rather early to abandon any
notion of equality of opportunity.
A much better policy would be to make quality nursery education a
statutory responsibility of the new unitary councils backed up by the
necessary funding. Any parent with the money and the inclination could
opt to go private, as would be their right.
If this sounds familiar then this is because it is the approach which
currently applies to mainstream schooling. It hasn't worked all that
badly in Scotland over the years. It provided Michael Forsyth with his
educational opportunity!
But this brings me to another half-memory from my happy days in St
Andrews University.
As I recall, educational vouchers was one of the notions kicking round
the various right-wing groups which claim, often to the university's
acute embarrassment, St Andrews as their spiritual home and Michael
Forsyth as one of their disciples.
Of course they didn't just mean vouchers for nursery education but for
all education -- primary, secondary, and tertiary. As experience has
taught us, the time lag between the floating of any notion, however
silly, and its emergence as Government policy is worryingly short.
This then is the background to Michael Forsyth's offer of
''consultation'' on nursery vouchers. Thus far the new Scottish
Secretary is showing more than a few signs of schizophrenia. On the one
hand there is the nice new cuddly Dr Michael who wants everyone to
consult him. Lurking in the cupboard is the old nasty Mr Forsyth, the
champion of the poll tax -- Thatcher's ''young Lochinvar'', as she
dubbed him in her memoirs.
With Scottish educational opinion virtually unanimous in its rejection
of a voucher scheme the consultation exercise will be an early test of
the Scottish Secretary's reformed personality.
If he consults and then accepts a hand-me-down scheme from south of
the Border he will be in a worse pickle than before. There is nothing
more foolish in politics than to raise expectations and not deliver.
If nursery vouchers are proposed in October it will be a sign that Mr
Nasty is out of the closet and once again stalking the land.

RANGERS will head into the draw for the preliminary round of the
European Champions' Cup in Switzerland at lunchtime today hoping to
avoid three possible opponents, writes Ken Gallacher.
Last night, manager Walter Smith targeted Croatians Hajduk Split, the
Ukrainians Dynamo Kiev, and Romanian champions Steaua Bucharest -- who
will play in the Ibrox pre-season tournament -- as the teams to fear
most from the eight possible opponents. The others who could be drawn
against the Scottish champions are Legia Warsaw from Poland, Ferencvaros
from Hungary, Rosenborg from Norway, Maccabi Tel Aviv from Israel, and
Anorthosis from Cyprus.
Said Smith: ''Obviously we were caught out in the last two years at
this stage, and we don't want that to happen again. But, while there are
these three really exceptional teams, we know that we must have our own
set-up right. And, this year so far we appear to have the opportunity to
do that.
''We don't have any injuries at the moment and we don't have players
who must be nursed back from operations.
''We should be OK by the time we complete our pre-season stint,
although we all recognise that this is coming very early in our season.
The teams from Eastern Europe would be best avoided because after all
the turmoil there has been in these countries, they now appear to be
getting back to the standard of football we always expected from them.''
Celtic still seem assured of missing out on the preliminary round of
the Cup-winners' Cup and, therefore, won't be in the draw today.
But, in the UEFA Cup, both Motherwell and Raith Rovers will have to
take part in a preliminary game. Both will be given reasonably
favourable draws -- if there is any such thing after last season's
shocks.

THE forward-looking Strathclyde Regional Council is to be
congratualted on its freephone service for reporting road faults.
I have had on occasion to call the number four times in the last three
months and on each occasion my call has been answered promptly and the
details noted by extremely courteous staff.
There is a slight problem, however.
On each occasion I report the same significant and dangerous hole in
the pavement outside my house; I am promised that the information has
been passed on; I observe the hole increasing in size over the following
weeks; I then have another free conversation with the super efficient
customer friendly staff.
Perhaps before I am on first-name terms with them someone can advise
me if I have missed the announcement of the withdrawal of the roads
repair services.
If on the other hand they are still out there and the problem is one
of communication can I suggest that they phone their freephone number,
quote my home address, and a very polite person will hopefully tell them
where to go.

WESTERN policy in Bosnia is in a dangerous state of confusion. Like
some quadrille from Alice in Wonderland events around Srebrenica seem to
be repeating May's movements in an unfortunate manner. Nato air strikes
seem to achieve little, whether they precede or follow the Serbian
capture of UN peacekeepers. In fact all military experience since the
Korean War nearly half a century ago shows the limitations of air power
even when deployed on a huge scale. Aerial strike capacities have
increased enormously since then in both precision and weight of delivery
but that fundamental fact has hardly altered. The most that can be
achieved, short of massive destruction, is the sort of short sharp shock
which the Bosnian Serbs have previously been able to brush aside. In
this case the limitation has been demonstrated in the fall of
Srebrenica, but there is an additional complication in the Serbian
seizure of 30 Dutch peacekeepers. The complicated and worrying rigmarole
of earlier summer, which involved 400 peacekeepers in Serbian hands,
will now be replayed. The Serbs euphemistically refer to these
unfortunates as ''guests'', while the UN more bluntly prefers
''hostages'', but in almost any other comparable situation they would be
called prisoners of war, in spite of their peacekeeping role.
The Serbs danced cleverly in May and were wise enough to avoid any
accompanying song, but they managed to humiliate the UN effort and Nato
simultaneously. It seemed for a moment that the UN and its backers,
including this country, would reassess its effort rigorously. Instead,
with Britain and France in the lead, it has greatly reinforced its
fighting strength, managing to win US financial support for what looks
curiously like an escalation of its role, although accompanied by talk
of the need to protect any proposed withdrawal. If the Serbs have the
ability to eliminate designated safe havens like Srebrenica, and the UN
has no ability to frustrate them, the peacekeepers are failing to keep
the peace, something which is nearly true also of Sarajevo, which
survives still but in a state of fluctuating siege with perpetual
suffering being widely distributed.
Outside involvement in the affairs of Bosnia has always been
predicated on achieving some humanitarian aims. It is justifiable so
long as that opportunity persists, but that does seem to be shrinking
and the present position must be close to forcing a decision either to
withdraw or to hit the Serbs far harder than has so far been attempted.
The UN aim to achieve neutrality between the three contending parties
has long been abandoned in Bosnian Serb eyes, and few objective
observers could identify the American support for the UN role as being
neutral when the US is so close to the Muslims, but the UN line has been
honestly proclaimed and as honestly maintained. In the event, however,
it has always been stretched by the role the Serbs have insisted on
playing: it is they who force the UN's hand all the time. Given the way
in which they now control nearly three-quarters of Bosnia it must be
hard for them to accept their policy has failed, though it has cost them
the support of their kinsmen in Serbia proper.
By the normal tests of the conduct of international affairs, the
Bosnian Serbs have so far been remarkably successful. They have hardly
been contained, except at Sarajevo, and whenever they have retreated it
has been only for a moment before orchestrating a renewed advance. The
UN and Nato must face some hard questions in the next few days, but
surely they should have known before yesterday's air strikes that these
would be mostly unproductive (a tank was hit, some other tanks reversed
their tracks). What next?

In the first of a yachting and boating series, Stewart Fraser takes a
look at how the potential sea farer can make a start
THE Clyde estuary provides some of the best family boating in the UK
-- but how best to make a start?
As with any other important facet of life, find an enthusiast. Show
your interest. Get afloat with someone who has a suitable craft, lots of
experience, and a spare life jacket.
What money are we talking about, then? For at least one full season,
be the gofer -- the person who fills the missing gap, makes the tea,
brings the sandwiches, is there to watch and learn, and not get in the
way.
You can certainly hire an ordinary rowing boat and explore the coastal
area to a limited extent. You can go out in one of the many fishing
boats for hire around the estuary. And you can have a go in a dinghy on
relatively calm waters, or the equivalent motor boat used to tow a skier
in a great froth of enthusiasm.
It is really the larger craft that interest the family, however.
In broad measure, this means something from 20 to 30ft in sailing or
motor yacht terms. Smaller boats are of course available, but they can
be a bit tricky for the inexperienced.
Is boating safe? Certainly, as long as you apply basic commonsense.
Ideally, go out with at least one person who is experienced, and can be
the skipper. Keep your outings fairly short to begin with. Know where
you are going, how to get there, and how to get back again. If it gets
dark, you'll need navigation lights.
The Clyde has lots of places to sail from. Slipways for dinghies and
smaller craft. Swinging moorings, which mean rowing out in a dinghy in
the first place, and marinas which give a casual step-aboard existence,
but are more expensive to use.
Sailboats definitely look more attractive than power craft, once the
sails are up, and particularly the large floating ones known as
spinnakers. Yet the sound of a sturdy engine, when the wind has gone or
is up to gale force, is most comforting. And a boat under power is by
far the quickest way to get from one place to another.
Racing perhaps? This is usually for the sailing fraternity, and is
covered by local clubs, with a body like the Clyde Cruising Club
handling the larger events and the musters, which are more for the
family sailer anyway.
How to choose which type of boat is better, sail or motor? Try as many
as you can. Is it disconcerting to find a sail boat leans over when the
wind starts to blow? Is a motor boat forever going up and down and
sideways all at the same time, for lack of a sail to steady things?
Boating on the Clyde today, as for these many years past, is about
getting pleasure from being afloat. Choose what pleases you. For many, a
sail boat with a good engine may well be the ideal compromise.
In any event, don't spend all your money without being sure of what
you want, and that the family as a whole can join in.
What do you need? A proper survey for a start. That makes sure your
boat, of whatever type, will be safe. Sails, or an engine? Both have to
be in good condition, and suitable for the boating you want.
Instruments? There's a plethora of them at the chandlers. Something to
tell you whether the wind is blowing, where it is coming from, what
speed it is. Something to tell you what direction you are going, what
depth there is beneath the keel. You can go on to radar, and position
finding by satellite if you want. Keep it simple is still a good
beginner's motto.
Once you've decided a boating life is the one for you, then you may as
well learn properly. Go to a sailing school. Learn that a map has become
a chart. That there is a great load of new terms, arcane boating jargon,
that lets your neighbours know you are into a new scene.
Ropes become sheets. Lines to the shore are warps. The small boat you
tow becomes a tender, and the rope that ties it to the bigger boat is a
painter. The sharp end is the stem, and the bit at the back is the
stern. Left, looking ahead, is port, and the other side is starboard.
Remembering to use life jackets is important, and how to use a VHF
radio where one is installed. Knowing how to read your chart, how to
make sense of a compass course, and the various rules of the road at sea
-- they're important, too, and an evening class or a session with a
teacher makes good sense.
What else do you need to know? It depends how ambitious you are, to a
large extent. Day sailing may be all you seek. Going to the outer isles
may be your aim. Either way, warm and waterproof clothing is sensible,
as is a means of having hot food. And whatever else, you still have to
keep out of the way of the ferries and the container ships.
Steam gives way to sail? Big boats give way to wee boats? Not really.
Commercial traffic has a job to do, and simply can't jink about. Check
before you begin where the ferries go, and consider their speed against
your own. If in any doubt, get out of the way.
You listen to experienced friends, and go out with them as
willing-to-learn crew. You soon pick up the patter, and the correct VHF
procedures. Channel 16 is for making contact, not for a half-hour
blether.
You know the coastguard is keeping a watchful eye on things, and that
the RNLI has volunteers on hand at 10 different places throughout
Strathclyde, from Troon to Tighnabruaich and Arran to Islay. But you
don't let complacency take over.
You treat the sea with respect, and enjoy your boating, this week and
next week, and look forward to next season as well. It soon becomes a
way of enjoying life.

ANY professional having trouble with putting this week need look no
further than across the road from the practice green, where he will see
Trevor Williamson in the golf shop at the Glencoe Hotel.
Trevor has designed a new style putter which he claims is more
accurate and more consistent than present day conventional clubs.
''In an ordinary putter there is some degree of loft on the blade.0 It
is the skid which can knock a putt off line. With my new putter the ball
starts to roll immediately it is hit.''
The club, called the ''Minus-1'', could be just what a pro with
problems could be looking for hopes Trevor. And it could start the ball
rolling for him.

SCOTTISH lamb producers have been given a tremendous export market
boost with the news that a major multiple is to promote the product in
25 stores across the Continent this autumn.
The Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb Association, which has battled for 20
years to achieve greater international recognition for members' produce,
heard yesterday that Marks &amp; Spencer will be promoting Scotch lamb in
France, Holland, Belgium and Spain from October, a peak time for the
lamb market.
Jean Claude Leroux, M&amp;S marketing director for foodstuffs in Europe,
told members of SQBLA: ''Scottish lamb has a justifiable reputation as a
naturally produced product with good taste and high quality.
''We need to make more European consumers aware of this and we are
keen to establish niche outlets in our stores in Europe.''
The promotion, to run with high-level publicity, is another follow-on
from a major Scottish food and drinks sales campaign in Paris earlier
this year.
The opportunity to widen sales in flagship stores could well mean
extra income for lamb and beef producers and exporters.
SQBLA chief executive Brian Simpson said: ''We have put a lot of
effort in recent years developing export markets and now we have a
unique and exciting opportunity to promote the product direct to
European consumers.
''This initiative will pay dividends for all involved in the
production, processing and promotion of Scotch lamb.''
However, there were warnings that beef and lamb producers would have
to do a great deal more in promotional activities at home and abroad if
they hope to increase demand.
SQBLA chairman John McNaughton said: ''We will have to fight every
inch of the way for Scotch beef and lamb to maintain its market share in
an increasingly international market and we will have to use every means
at our disposal to differentiate the Scotch label from our competitors.
Farm Assurance is a vital component in this strategy''.
He stressed the value of farm quality assurance and the need for high
visibility of the Scottish product at High Street level to maintain and
expand home sales.
SQBLA gains #250,000 from EU grants and is recruiting more
butcher-supporters for its Guild of Scotch Quality Meat Suppliers'
network.
The scheme has had over 400 new applications since April 1 and Mr
McNaughton said: ''We now have a scheme which every professional farmer
should join and my message to the retail trade of Britain and the rest
of Europe is clear -- if you want farm assurance for your customers then
Scotland is where to get it.
''Already we have had over 600 applications from throughout the UK
which probably means we have the biggest marketing group of its kind in
Europe.''
The establishment of the Scotch Beef Club has gained many
international customers with at least 600 restaurants applying to join.
The annual report of SQBLA shows a surplus after tax of almost #15,000
compared to a loss of #5700 in the previous year. More than #1.3m was
spent on promotion.

James Laing receives some instruction on how to play Carnoustie's
Championship Course
THE Championship course at Carnoustie was born in the sixteenth
century when parish records tell of ''gowf'' on the links in 1560. One
man who will be enormously impressed by this antiquity is the American
Masters champion, Ben Crenshaw. He is a fanatic about the history and
traditions of golf and probably knows a lot more about Carnoustie than
the locals. Except how to play it.
Few golfers can claim an absolute knowledge of Carnoustie. Like most
other Scottish links courses, it can play differently every day
depending on wind direction, weather or state of the fairways. The
championship course is waiting to savage any player who treats it with
less than respect.
One local man, caddy master Martin Roy knows every blade of grass on
the course from all its tees and through all its hidden hazards. Here is
a hole by hole description. The yardages given may differ for the
Championship depending on which tees are used.
Cup -- 410yds
1.THIS hole earned its name because the green lies in a slight hollow
and gathers the ball. Not the most testing opening in golf. There is out
of bounds up the left to catch a player who hooks. For a top pro on a
good day it will be a drive and an eight or nine iron. But if the wind
blows Roy has seen pros take a one iron for their second. Missing the
green on the right brings a new bunker into play and the rough on the
left is torture. But it is a fairly benign start.
Gulley -- 435yds
2.THE fairway lies in a gulley between sand dunes and the competitors
are not playing from the tiger tees which softens the severity.
Scenically it is a great hole and not an easy par four. The fairway is
very narrow and funnels to a slight dog-leg. The hour-glass shaped green
is 58-yards deep and pin placements can mean as much as a four club
difference in the approach shot. Drives have to be very precise and the
stroke average if the wind blows will be above par.
Jockie's Burn -- 342yds
3.NAMED for the man-made drainage ditch which runs throughout the
course. This is a much improved hole in recent years but not difficult
for a top player. In flat calm weather they will be taking an iron off
the tee to avoid the burn which guards the green, then a nine iron or
wedge to the flag. There are bunkers up the players' left and two
greenside bunkers to catch the unwary.
Hillocks -- 410yds
4.THE name is self explanatory with little hillocks in the way.
Players in the Scottish will be using a new tee which was built for the
Amateur held over the course earlier this year. The central bunker in
the middle of the fairway will come into play requiring a 235-yard carry
from the tee. It demands a very exacting tee shot. The second shot is
equally testing since it is to the only double green on the course and
pin positions can be crucial.
Brae -- 420yds
5. AGAIN this is a much improved hole thanks to the efforts of the
links superintendent John Philp and his greenkeeping staff. There are
two new bunkers up the left-hand side and a new championship tee which
has lengthened the hole to test the driving ability of players. It is a
sharp dog-leg right to a well guarded two-tier green which amateurs and
pros alike detest. There can be a three club difference depending on
where the pin is placed. Hogan, when he won the Open, chipped in for a
birdie from a bad lie just off the green compiling his last round 68.
Long -- 570yds
6. THIS is the famous hole where a stretch of fairway 250-plus yards
out from the tee is know around the world as ''Hogan's Alley''. On each
of the four rounds Hogan struck his tee shot down the left-hand side
fading it back from out of bounds on to the prime position. There is
another story that on his second round on the last day he played from
the same divot mark he had made in the morning. Today with modern
equipment, better balls and stronger players the bunkers with which
Hogan flirted don't always come into play.
Plantation -- 405yds
7. NAMED for the plantation of trees created to separate the fairway
from the 14th fairway. There are well placed bunkers on right-hand side.
The professionals will probably take them out of play by using as low as
a three iron off the tee if the weather is calm and reaching the green
with a seven or eight iron. The green is something else. It is one of
the hardest greens in golf to read, with with the most subtle borrows,
contours and undulations. Many players misjudge the second shot because
it looks so benign but it is one of the hidden gems of Carnoustie.
Short -- 182yds
8. PLAYERS face a daunting tee shot with out of bounds on the left and
cavernous bunkers on the right of the green to catch the over-careful
shot. Tom Weiskopf had a hole in one here during a practice round for
the 1975 Open when he was playing with Jack Nicklaus. They had become
involved in a ''skins'' challenge for a few pounds with Australian Jack
Newton and a young pro called John O'Leary. Nicklaus, who almost never
plays opponents for money, and Weiskopf played the last 14 holes in a
better ball 17 under par. The Newton-O'Leary team managed only one
halved hole.
Railway -- 474yds
9. A GREAT hole named for the railway line running at the back of the
green. Some bushes in front of the tee have been cut back to allow the
players to see the fearsome bunkers lurking to catch a wayward shot.
Nicklaus suggested in 1968 that a new bunker should be built 320 yards
out and the links committee agreed. It is named for the American and
comes into play for big hitters. In perfect conditions it is still a
drive and a very long iron second. If the wind blows it could be two
drivers and the ball could still end up short.
South America -- 466yds
10. THE story is that a local man aiming to emigrate to South America
had a going away party with some friends and staggered back to his house
at the side of the 10th hole. The next morning he woke and decided his
home in Carnoustie was good enough for him. The hole is invariably the
one with the highest stroke average in any class of competition and is
without doubt the most difficult hole on the course. It is an incredible
driving hole with massive bunkers strategically placed. The green is
guarded by the Barry Burn and a player who walks off with a par four
will be very pleased.
Dyke -- 385yds
11. THIS hole used to have a stone wall across the fairway hence the
name. Again it has a slight dog leg, but it will be a big relief for the
players who have just walked off the monster 10th. It is the easiest
hole on the back nine and gives a player a little breather before facing
the rigours of the remaining holes. A drive or long iron followed by a
wedge or nine iron should do. The green has recently been reconstructed
and is far more undulating that previously Few players missing the green
will be able to get up and down in two.
Southward Ho -- 405yds
12. THIS hole has been considerably shortened from its normally
fearsome 479 yards to allow for spectator and television camera access.
Some local opinion says the compromise is just to suit the professionals
and give them a break from the rigours of the course. The reduction in
length has taken the fairway bunkers virtually out of play and with the
prevailing wind it will be little more than a drive and a flick for the
leading contenders.
Whins -- 168yds
13. ANOTHER great short hole, named for the bushes which decorate the
fairway and behind the green. On a windless day a brisk five iron should
reach the green comfortably. If the wind blows hard some will need a two
iron. Pin positions at the front or the back right make it a very
difficult hole to putt -- it has the most severe slopes of any green on
the course.
Spectacles -- 518yds
14. A SPECTACULAR driving hole and it is borderline to carry the
spectacle bunkers with the second shot with a one iron or a three wood.
For a player prepared to take it on the reward is there, but it will
need two great shots. There is out of bounds on the left and bunkers
lying in wait for a hooked drive. The rough is severe. There is a little
more room up the right, but again there is a bunker and thick rough to
catch an imprecise tee shot. Gary Player made an eagle three when he won
the Open in 1968 and even he enthused about the quality of his second
shot. ''I hit it so straight I had to lean sideways to see the pin,'' he
said.
Lucky Slap -- 459yds
15. FOR some this is the perfect hole and a lucky slap won't do. The
tee shot has to be slightly drawn right to left and the second has to be
faded left to right. It will test the skills of everyone on the course
and will only yield to a player who knows how to manipulate a golf ball.
Hogan could do it. So could Bobby Locke, and Lee Trevino is still
capable of this kind of shots. On the left is the highest point on the
course and the views are spectacular.
Barry Burn -- 250yds
16. THE burn creeps in on the left at this enormously difficult par
three hole. In 1968 Nicklaus, unbelievably, had to hit a driver into it
and asked for it to be re-measured. He could not believe it was a par
three. The green is on a plateau which is notoriously difficult to hold.
Watson had to play the hole competitively five times in the 1975 Open
including the play-off and he had a bogey four every time. And he still
won.
Island -- 457yds
17. THIS hole gains its name because the Barry Burn splits the fairway
in two and the drive has to carry on to what seems like an island to set
up the shot to the green. But, for a pro nowadays on a calm day, it is
something like a two or even a three iron to set up the all-important
second shot. It is firing at a target. Players don't want to run out of
fairway and incur a penalty off the drive and it is a mentally
challenging task. Another of the great holes in golf.
Home -- 512yds
18. THIS is a no-nonsense par five hole. John Philp has built a new
elevated tee here and players will be busting their braces to get to
what is known as ''the rise''. Failure means reaching the ''low ground''
and they know there is only a slim chance of a shot to the green from
there. With the exception of really long hitters, such as John Daly or
Davis Love, most will go for a par five and be happy. In 1975 Johnny
Miller thought he needed a birdie to tie with Tom Watson and reached the
right hand bunker which still bears his name. He left it in there and
lost. There will be drama at this hole every day of the Scottish
Championship.

BARCLAY Howard's successful battles against personal demons, involving
domestic disorder and drink problems, were happily vindicated yesterday
when he was named as one of the four Scottish players chosen for the
Great Britain and Ireland team to meet the United States in the Walker
Cup match on September 9 and 10 at Royal Porthcawl.
Altogether eight of the 10 places have been filled. The two other
members of the side will be named next month after the new Mid-Amateur
championship, by which time the four Home Countries' national
championships will have been decided, allowing the selectors further
opportunities for deliberation.
The three others who help make up the largest contingent of Scots
since five took part in the ill-fated matches of 1977, 1979 and 1987 are
the Amateur champion, Gordon Sherry, Stephen Gallacher, the European
champion, whose several other exploits made them certain to be chosen,
and Graham Rankin.
Howard, the 42-year-old Cochrane Castle player, ultimately took an
important part in Scotland's European Team championship victory last
weekend but, unemployed now for more than two years, he made his way
into the side more on his individual performances last season than in
the current one.
The reverse holds true for Rankin. The 29-year-old Palacerigg golfer
has this year won the St Andrews Links Trophy and West of Scotland
title, and he also played his part in the team victory on Sunday in
Belgium.
At this stage the only survivor of the team on the wrong end of a 19-5
drubbing at Interlachen two years ago is the Irishman, Padraig
Harrington. Moreover, no Welsh player has so far been considered worthy
of a place in a match to be played in the Principality for the first
time and under a Welsh captain, Clive Brown.
The three others selected are from England, led by the current
champion, Mark Foster, who is joined by David Howell, beaten by Sherry
in the Amateur semi-final round, and Lee James, who defeated Sherry in
that championship's final last year. Players chosen:
Mark Foster (Worksop), 19; Stephen Gallacher (Bathgate), 20; Barclay
Howard (Cochrane Castle), 42; David Howell (Broome Manor), 20; Lee James
(Broadstone), 22; Padraig Harrington (Stackstown), 23; Graham Rankin
(Palacerigg), 29, and Gordon Sherry (Barassie), 21.

WITH the AAA Championships scheduled this weekend, not one Scottish
male athlete has achieved the qualifying standard for the World
Athletics Championships in Gothenburg next month, the team for which
will be announced on Monday, writes Doug Gillon.
The latest rankings (world qualifying mark in brackets), courtesy of
the Scottish Association of Track Statisticians, show Doug Walker to
have run faster in the 200m, but that was wind assisted. On this
evidence, Scottish male representation in the UK team for Gothenburg
could be an all-time low.

SCOTLAND beat Canada 3-0 but then went down by the same margin to the
No.1 seeds, Australia, in the World Junior Women's Squash Championships
in Sydney.
The Scots suffered a further set-back with both Pam Nimmo and Laura
Hamilton suffering injuries that have left them doubtful for today's
vital match against Egypt.
Physiotherapy may enable Hamilton to take the court against Egypt in a
match that will decide who will go through to the semi-finals.
Nimmo could hardly walk after suffering an ankle injury in a fall on
courts which have non-sprung floors, while Hamilton further aggravated a
groin problem.
In the opposite half of the draw, England and New Zealand remain on
course to take their seeded places in the last four.

THE list of contenders for the Scottish Open title reads like a
''Who's-Who'' of world golf.
Nick Faldo is playing only his second European event of the season and
Ben Crenshaw was one of the first top Americans to confirm his entry.
Other Americans include Davis Love III and the new phenomenon of golf,
the young black amateur, ''Tiger'' Woods.
The top European money winner for the past two seasons, Colin
Montgomerie, has already spent much of the past two weeks practicing on
the course which was voted the best in Britain two years ago. He would
love to win the Scottish title.
Sandy Lyle, the pride of Scotland when he won The Open and the hero of
Britain when he won the Masters at Augusta, is on a splendid return to
form. He will be there to try to re-establish a reputation which has
faltered in recent seasons.
The Welsh former Masters champion, Ian Woosnam is in the field. So too
is the apologetic Severiano Ballesteros who said sorry to his fans when
he missed the Irish Open cut last weekend. The Spanish genius arrived
early this week armed with a video camera and an adviser to check his
swing. He badly wants to put his recent form behind him.
Teeing up also are David Gilford, Philip Walton, and a host of names
recognised around the world.
Scotland's own Sam Torrance, fresh from his triumph in the Murphy's
Irish Open, is obviously on a high now that his place in the Ryder Cup
team is assured and will be trying to a lot more money to his bank
account.
With such a range of talent it will be a feast for the 100,000-plus
spectators expected to range over the Carnoustie course. The Sky
Television coverage has a potential of more than 300 million households
in almost 20 countries world-wide with huge audiences in Japan and all
over Asia.
And this championship has a habit of throwing up a dark horse winner.
Barry Lane beat Sandy Lyle into second place in 1988. Michael Allen
took the top prize from under the nose of Jose Maria Olazabal the
following year and Peter O'Malley finished ahead of Colin Montgomerie in
1992.
But the severity of the test at Carnoustie will certainly separate the
top men from the rest. It is a far more difficult examination of a
player's game compared to the ease of the resort course, the King's, at
Gleneagles Hotel.
And the size of the prize money will mean the players will not be
using it as a learning experience for The Open at St Andrews next week.
They will want to win. The winner will pocket #108,330 and that counts
towards Ryder Cup points as well.
Local opinion is that it will take an experienced player, a big hitter
who is a consistent putter to win this event.
Faldo is leading the bookies' betting list at 8-1 closely followed by
Colin Montgomerie at 11-1.
But in a field of such quality the eventual winner on the rostrum on
Saturday evening could be any one of the 15 top men.

WISHAW'S John Higgins -- winner of three world ranking events last
season -- again has been given a wild-card call-up to the #165,000 Regal
Scottish Masters at Motherwell Civic Centre in September.
Higgins became the first teenager to win three ranking events in the
same season following his successes in the 1994 Skoda Grand Prix, the
1995 Sweater Shop International Open, and the 1995 Castella Classic
British Open.
In a remarkable 1994-95 season, the 1991 World Masters Junior champion
also was runner-up in the Regal Welsh and the Masters at Wembley.
His first-round match in this year's tournament is guaranteed to be a
sell-out as he takes on Scotland's world No.6 Alan McManus in a rematch
of the world-championship first round. McManus won that one 10-3, a
victory which maintained his position among the top eight, with the
guarantee of invitation to elite events such as the Scottish Masters.
''I am delighted that I have earned a wild-card chance -- the Regal
Masters is Scotland's top tournament,'' said Higgins, who is now 20.
''Motherwell is on my doorstep, I can be there in a few minutes. I was
given a wild-card place at the Regal Masters in 1992, the year I turned
pro. I played Steve Davis and was beaten 5-2.
''Now I am looking forward to playing Alan McManus and there should be
a great atmosphere with two Scots in action.''
Other wild-card selections are world No.12 Nigel Bond, who reached the
world final earlier this year, and world No.10 Peter Ebdon. Their
inclusion means that all of the world's top 12 players will be in action
from September 19 to 24. Draw for the first two rounds:
First round -- J Wattana (Thailand) v P Ebdon (England), winner to
play holder K Doherty (Ireland); A McManus (Scotland) v J Higgins
(Scotland), winner plays R O'Sullivan (England); J Parrott (England) v D
Morgan (Wales), winner plays S Davis (England); J White (England) v N
Bond (England), winner plays S Hendry (Scotland).

In this supplement, James Laing examines the history and the build up
that led to the Scottish Open Championship being played at Carnoustie
TODAY, July 12, 1995, a new era begins for the Tayside town of
Carnoustie. For the first time in 25 years a major international golf
tournament, The Scottish Open, begins over the town's historic links.
And it is only the first in a series of events which will catapult the
image and reputation of Carnoustie into the world arena.
Television pictures of this week's event will be beamed around the
world to bring the fearsome quality of the course to a new generation of
golfers. The Open Championship is scheduled for 1999, a historic return
for the world's leading tournament and it will provide an enormous boost
for the economy of the town and the area.
But the return to world prominence has not been achieved without
effort. The Links Management Committee, a local business association,
has lobbied for years for the return of a European Tour event. Now
within a year their efforts have attracted two major professional
championships.
And how the old resort has welcomed it. There is a new vibrancy about
the town. It is a kind of excitement, a thrill, which can be felt in the
streets, the shops, the golf clubs and hotels. And there is no doubt
Carnoustie deserves this revival in its fortunes.
No-one in golf has ever doubted the quality of the golf course.
Indeed, there is a wry thought among some locals that international
class tournaments didn't come back to the town because the top
professionals were too afraid of the severity of test it set them.
And every time The Open Championship was held over the links it
invariably threw up a quality champion. In 1931 Tommy Armour was winner,
in 1937 it was Henry Cotton's turn. Ben Hogan, a legend in the town,
took the honours in 1953 and the last time it was played at Carnoustie,
1975, Tom Watson was victor after a nail-biting extra round play-off
with Jack Newton. Every championship had its drama. And every champion
knew his win was a triumph.
The field assembled this week for the Scottish Open reflects the
importance the top professionals place on the tournament. They know that
next week they will be tackling The Open at St Andrews and there could
be no better place to hone and polish their skills than Carnoustie.
The credit for attracting the Scottish to the town is being given to a
combination of factors but the most important has been the work of the
Links Management Committee and of the green staff on the course. The
chairman of the committee, John Calder, a former director of a major
building company in Tayside, took over his position in 1984. And his
first initiative was to commission a feasability study on the prospect
of the town and links hosting The Open.
The Royal and Ancient were sympathetic but turned them down. There
were doubts about traffic problems, lack of hotels, communications, a
series of stumbling blocks. And Carnoustie went back into the doldrums
of international renown. John Calder tried again in 1989, this time to
attract the Ryder Cup.
''We came close,'' he said. ''But again we didn't get the event.''
When other people were losing heart John Calder persevered. In 1993
the committee commissioned another and up-dated feasability study. This
time all they wanted to do was to attract a European tour event, not
even a major event, but one that would once more bring their course and
town to the forefront. At the beginning of last year there was nothing.
The European PGA Tour officials could find no gaps in their diary of
events, no space for even a minor tournament.
It seemed, despite all the work on the course, despite all the efforts
to persuade the powerful golf associations, Carnoustie was to play host
to busloads of Americans and the odd Japanese golfers remembering the
old days. But events elsewhere were to prove crucial for Carnoustie.
For eight successful years the Bell's whisky firm had sponsored the
Scottish Open. It was played over the King's Course at the Gleneagles
Hotel. Suddenly the sponsorship ended and tournament chairman Allan
Callan had to find a new venue. His championship had grown in stature
every year since it was launched and many courses throughout Scotland
coveted the event.
But John Calder and Allan Callan met and after initial, and sometimes
clandestine, meetings the deal was struck. It will only be for two years
but it is certain that top golfers, sponsors and the avid spectators
welcome the revitalisation of one of Britain's greatest championship
courses.

EVERY year since 1991 Ben Crenshaw has won a US Tour event -- not a
remarkable revelation in itself for someone who had already gained 15
victories, except that they supported the view that applies to golf
perhaps more than to any other sport that life can indeed continue for a
fortysomething professional.
Of course, the successes of 1992, '93 and '94, although welcome in
themselves, were as nothing compared with Crenshaw's second victory in
the US Masters tournament at Augusta last April, a particularly
emotional occasion since the previous week he had been a pallbearer at
the funeral of his renowned and revered coach, Harvey Penick.
After he had completed another survey of the Carnoustie links in
preparation for today's first round of the Scottish Open, Crenshaw
reflected: ''It's been tough getting back on my feet. My best finish
since the Masters was fifth in the Memorial. Otherwise it's been on-off,
just not able to hold a score together.
''I never know where my game is coming from these days,'' Crenshaw
added. And echoing the dilemma of many an average golfer, he admitted:
''I have trouble reaching the end of my backswing.'' Then, like most
professionals, Crenshaw acknowledged one lingering ambition.
Casting a glance beyond this event towards next week's Open
Championship, he said: ''Any Open at St Andrews is special. A fortunate
few have won there and I'd like to join them.'' For what his opinion is
worth Crenshaw takes Corey Pavin, Nick Faldo and Greg Norman as his
prime candidates to succeed.
''The Old Course requires a vivid imagination, the ability to move the
ball around and the game to save adverse situations,'' Crenshaw noted.
''Pavin has these assets, as he showed in winning the US Open, Faldo has
too good memories of 1990 not to become a factor again, and Norman is
playing spectacular golf.''
Having missed the 1975 Open because of an arm injury, he accepted an
invitation to the Scottish Open because of the chance to play these
neighbouring courses in successive weeks. But what about the Open
champion Nick Price's reservations that prolonged exposure to the
buffeting winds experienced at seaside courses could seriously disrupt
the mechanics of the swing?
''You get rough weather and you play survival golf,'' Crenshaw
observed. ''Jack Nicklaus used to say that two straight weeks of links
golf made his swing quicken and make his hands more involved. But you
get your rhythm back eventually.'' More to the immediate point was his
opinion of Carnoustie.
Having played 18 holes with the US amateur champion, Tiger Woods, and
the two young Scottish assistants, John Greaves and Alan Tait, who last
year broke Jack Newton's 1975 Open Championship record of 65 by a
stroke, Crenshaw repeated his respect for the taxing Carnoustie finish.
Refering to the 235-yard sixteenth, he said: ''It's not often that you
take the driver out at a short hole, even into the wind.'' Crenshaw has
been trying to imagine, too, how the course would play if the wind
changed direction from the north-east (as it has been blowing in
practice) as it surely will before the championship is over. From
whatever direction, however, the strength of the par 4s will remain and
all the clubs in the bag will be needed.
Woods, aged 19, is enjoying his first experience of links conditions,
which includes learning the run-up shot and accepting that the bounce of
the ball will not always be in his favour, as is more likely on the
lusher pastures of America to which he is, almost exclusively,
accustomed.
One of these players from whom incident seems already to have become
inseparable, at the 459-yard fifteenth hole Woods hit a No.2-iron shot
into the wind which pitched on a downslope 215 yards away and the ball
would certainly have overrun the green if instead it had not struck the
flagstick.

<HEADLINE>Strang warns on research funding cuts</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
CUTS in agricultural research funding could have severe repercussions
not only for British farming, but for consumers and world food supplies,
it was claimed yesterday.
Dr Gavin Strang, Shadow Agricultural Minister, said it was a scandal
that publicly-funded research and advisory services were being cut back
while Common Agricultural Policy spending had almost doubled in the last
15 years.
Scientists employed by the Government-backed Biotechnology and
Biological Sciences Research Council had been cut by 42% -- down from
nearly 3500 to under 2000 -- while veterinary surgeons in the state
service had been reduced by 32% to just over 400 with veterinary
investigation centres halved to 13.
''The media reports this week about Ministerial delays in taking
action on information linking listeria in food products with
miscarriages, stillbirths and birth defects reminds us how important
research is in keeping our food safe,'' said Dr Strang at the Great
Yorkshire Show in Harrogate.
''The long-term health of our livestock is also being jeopardised as a
result of these cutbacks.''
A poor research and development programme also had profound effects on
developing and under-developed countries, said Professor Edward Schuh of
the University of Minnesota, speaking at the International Farm
Management Association Congress at Reading University.
The economic crises of the 1980s had caused many of these countries to
neglect agricultural research systems leading to an inadequate capacity
to develop much-needed production technology. This was being further
undermined by problems in international research agreements.
''The technological capacity for research to support agriculture in
the developing countries is already weak and would have been further
decimated with the lack of support for that system,'' he said.
It could undermine trade liberalisation aims of the most recent Gatt
agreement.
''With near exhaustion of further potential gains from the miracle
rices and wheats and the apparent lack of alternative sources of
technological breakthroughs to drive the system in the future, the world
may well face a global food crisis in the decade ahead as a consequence
of the failure to invest in the capacity for agricultural research in
the past.''
Typically, animal health companies may allocate up to 10% of their
turnover to research and development on new products, but they stress
the need for state-backed ''blue skies'' research as a platform.
Once such company, Mycofarm UK, yesterday gave its first public
demonstration of two new sheep vaccines -- Enzovax and Toxovax -- to
farmers at Moulton College in Northampton.
The vaccines, developed over the past five to seven years at a cost in
seven figures, are designed to combat sheep abortion which costs the
industry up to #35m a year in lost lambs.

GRAEME Obree continues his pursuit of excellence in Adelaide,
Australia, tomorrow when he lines up against the best in the business in
another round of the World Cup track series.
The 27-year-old former world champion, who has set his sights on
regaining the title in the world championships in Colombia in October,
is Britain's one-man band in the southern hemisphere.
Normally Britain have an eight-strong team competing in a world cup
meeting, but the high travel costs put the trip to Australia and another
world cup round in Tokyo next week way beyond the budget of the
cash-strapped British Cycling Federation.
Team manager Doug Dailey, with an eye on the worlds in Colombia,
decided the flying Scot was the only choice, and with Chris Boardman's
season at an end after his Tour de France crash, it looks a sensible
decision.
Obree, who left the UK on Sunday, did not have the best preparation
for an event of such importance with a 25-hour flight, but a rest day
has put him in fine fettle.
He hopes to repeat his form of May when he turned the heat up in
Athens to demolish Austrian pursuiter Dietmar Muller, and his qualifying
time of 4min 32.6sec was three seconds ahead of the rest of the field.
''I am feeling fine now and looking forward to the competition,'' he
said. ''My form has been quite good recently and I am building up
towards the worlds in Colombia.''
The Scot is being modest -- he had a hat trick of victories during the
Isle of Man Week, breaking two records on the way, and but for a strong
wind he would have broken three.
The past few months have brought a steady but gradual improvement in
the Scot's fortunes after he was sacked by French club Le Groupement
(who have since gone bust) at the start of the year.
He signed up with German team, Die Continentale, in February and
started working on a new high-profile position on the bike. This
Superman position is paying off -- and has met with no criticism from
the world authority, UCI, who banned his familiar downhill-ski style
which brought two world records and a world title in 1993.
''I am getting stronger every day in this new position, but I still
need to better 4-25 in the pursuit to qualify for the worlds. But I am
confident I can do it soon.''

GREAT Britain yesterday emerged as the top marksmen so far in the
European Youth Olympics men's hockey tournament at Bath. They beat
Switzerland 9-0, and now dispute the leadership of their group with
Holland who have an inferior goal difference.
David Matthews, who plays his hockey with Canterbury, was Great
Britain's top scorer with five goals but Touche Ross Gordonians player
Andy Balchin made a big impact after having come on after 42 minutes as
a substitute and scored another two of his side's goals.
Also going well are Ireland, who beat Germany 1-0 on Monday for the
first time. In their second outing, they won a seven-goal thriller
against Spain. Results:
FIRST SERIES. Pool A -- Spain 2, Belgium 2; Germany 0, Ireland 1. Pool
B -- Holland 3, Switzerland 0; Great Britain 6, Italy 1.
SECOND SERIES. Pool A -- Belgium 1, Germany 4; Ireland 4, Spain 3.
Pool B -- Italy 0, Holland 3; Great Britain 9, Switzerland 0.

WHEN it comes down to talking and fighting, Chris Eubank is no slouch.
Unless, of course, Prince Naseem Hamed happens to be sitting in the
second row of a press conference announcing Eubank's #1.6m WBO
super-middleweight title rematch against Ireland's Steve Collins at
Cork's Pairc Ui Chaoimh Gaelic football stadium on September 9.
Hypnotic would describe the presence of either boxer. Hypnotism was
the bone of contention yesterday.
The former champion is still angered by Collins' revelation -- ''legal
cheating,'' as he calls it -- that he was hypnotised before he took
Eubank's title and unbeaten record in Millstreet in March.
But Hamed, never short of a word of fighting philosophy, piped up:
''All this stuff about hypnosis is nonsense. It's all about a fighter
against a fighter, strength against strength and power against power.
Don't make excuses why he got beat. Get back in there; come back and
win. That's the only way to do it.''
Collins will be fully under the influence of Dr Tony Quinn this time.
He said he was only 60% through the hypnotism course last time. But
Eubank rapped: ''Collins can have the devil on his side, but it won't
count. His hypnotherapist will be out of a job on September 10.''
* BRITISH middleweight champion Neville Brown is to make his debut
under the control of his new manager Frank Warren on July 22.
Brown, who is to challenge former stablemate Richie Woodhall for the
Telford fighter's European title in October, has left Mickey Duff to
link-up with Warren.
His first fight under the Warren banner later this month -- against an
as yet un-named opponent -- will come on the undercard of Nigel Benn's
WBC super-middleweight title defence against Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello
at the London Arena.

APPLIED Distribution has agreed to pay #6.15m for Blue Cap Logistics
via a placing and open offer of just over 1.3 million new shares at 177p
a share which will raise #2.4m. The acquisition is conditional on
shareholder approval.
Blue Cap provides specialist warehousing and distribution services to
a number of well-known food retailers and manufacturers including Swiss
group Nestle, owners of Rowntree. It operates from four sites, including
Menstrie in Clackmannanshire.
There is a lot of synergy between the two groups. Applied specialises
in distributing food and other fast-moving consumer goods, fresh
produce, cut flowers and pot plants under temperature controlled
conditions.
The company was formed to provide the vehicle for the #16.5m
management buy-out of Geest's contract distribution business in February
1989.
Applied has a 120,000 sq ft depot in Bellshill, Glasgow, which is
partly temperature controlled and largely dedicated to two customers,
Nestle and the Co-op Wholesale Society (CWS).
For Nestle it handles 1500 grocery and confectionery lines and serves
750 customers throughout Scotland. The CWS contract covers 200 lines of
fresh produce for delivery to 190 stores.
The enlarged group will be able to offer expertise across the full
range of ambient, chilled and frozen distribution to existing and new
customers. At the end of the 1994 calendar year Blue Cap had net assets
of #1.4m. It operates a fleet of 50 vehicles and employs around 150
people. During the same period its sales and turnover were #7.3m and
#900,000 respectively.
Commenting on the acquisition, Sir Hugh Bidwell, chairman of Applied
Distribution, said the wider customer base and extended depot network
provided opportunities to generate additional business. ''The enlarged
group is well placed to take advantage of growing demand for third-party
contract distribution.''
This acquisition is a logical step for Applied Distribution which
stated at the time of its flotation in March last year that it intended
to expand both organically and by selective acquisition. Since flotation
the company has won new contracts and has completed the acquisition of
Bernard Brook Transport and the in-house distribution business of Sara
Lee Household &amp; Personal Care.

* THE Scottish Milk Records Association lost 31 members last year --
mostly due to herds ceasing milk production. That loss was
counterbalanced by 36 new herds joining the scheme and overall there was
a 4.8% increase in the number of cows recorded.
The SMRA, which provides individual farmers with comparative figures
for every cow in their herd, now covers 47.4% of dairy cows in Scotland
-- at 110,773 that is the highest actual number since milk quotas began
10 years ago.
SMRA director Jack Lawson said that the introduction of a new computer
programme had greatly enhanced the service. ''To keep Scotland
competitive in milk production we are aiming for steady increases in
membership to at least 60% of the national herd,'' he said. The new
chairman of the association is Robert Dobie, Bencloich, Lennoxtown.

ALLAN Callan, chairman of the Scottish Open Golf Championship,
declared yesterday that after a five-year programme of two or three of
the events going to the west and east of the country, by the millennium
the championship would be played over its own course, to be called The
Scottish Open Golf Club.
''We are examining various sites, both existing courses and greenfield
areas where one could be built,'' he stated. ''Depending on the ultimate
development it will require substantial investment, but a sound plan
will always find willing fund partners.''
Callan, adding that there was no intention of seeking a title sponsor,
said: ''The biggest sponsor has been the Scottish public. They have
delivered our success, when from the start we were regularly told that
the championship would not work. In fact, the title is one of the most
powerful in world golf.''
As to the switch from BBC to Sky TV to continue this year and next,
Callan said: ''There had to be an opportunity for change in UK
television and golf needed it. BBC Scotland did not put forward a
propostion, though they will show highlights this week.''

THE Beatson Oncology Centre at Glasgow's Western Infirmary, is
Scotland's largest cancer treatment centre. Last year, from a West of
Scotland population of 2.8m, over 6000 new patients were referred to it,
with a total of some 70,000 patient attendances being made over the
course of the year.
The Beatson's special skills in certain areas, saw patients being
referred to the centre from many health boards from Greater Glasgow,
Argyll and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran, Dumfries and Galloway, Forth
Valley, Grampian, Tayside and the Western Isles, to others as far afield
as Northern and Southern Ireland.
Since the Beatson Oncology Centre -- which has almost 140 in-patient
beds and a staff of 350 -- opened in 1988, there has been continuous
on-going development both of its facilities and its role. Last November,
the West Glasgow Hospitals University NHS Trust embarked on its #3m
Phase 5 development, which will culminate in the integration of all
cancer treatment in the West of Scotland at the Beatson.
In the past, the Centre's patients had been treated at a number of
locations -- including the Western Infirmary and Belvidere Hospital. By
the turn of the year, Belvidere, the last remaining off-site facility
will be relocated to the Beatson, along with its equipment.
However, two linear accelerators (X-Ray therapy machines) respectively
12 and 14 years old, are being replaced by two state of the art units,
one of which is being calibrated at the Beatson. They will join the four
linear accelerators in use at the Centre.
The new Clinac 600C machines manufactured by Varian Oncology Systems,
a US company, have an X-ray beam with an energy level of six million
volts. Fully computer controlled, they are amongst the world's most
advanced linear accelerators. One has been fitted with a Multi-Leaf
Collimator (MLC), the first in Scotland, and one of only 12 or so in the
UK. It has been paid for by an anonymous donor.
The MLC's set of ''leaves'' allow X-rays to be defined in irregular
shapes rather than being restricted to squares and oblongs, the first
time this has been possible in Scotland. It will be particularly useful
in treating areas such as the head or neck, where there are curvatures,
allowing the X-ray beams to be precisely shaped to the tumour, enabling
the dose of radiation to be increased, and reducing damage to
surrounding healthy tissues.
Also fitted on this Clinac, is an electronic imaging device which
monitors the X-rays which get through the patient, confirming that the
correct area is being hit by the beams. This on-line monitoring, which
has other valuable functions, is another first in Scotland.
New treatment planning computers, also from Varian Oncology Systems,
use information from X-ray films and scanners to identify the tumour,
and allow the radiotherapist to outline its boundaries. Physics staff
can then use the data about each accelerator, which is stored in the
treatment planning computers to calculate the best combination of X-ray
beams to irradiate the tumour with the required amount of radiation,
while protecting surrounding healthy tissue. The data is then
transferred to the computers which control the linear accelerator which
will treat that particular patient.
Due to arrive within a few months, is an Orthovoltage Therapy Unit.
Manufactured by Pantak Ltd of Reading, it provides X-rays of 300,000
volts of energy for orthovoltage treatments, and of 150,000 volts for
superficial skin treatments. Ceiling mounted, it can be positioned at
any angle to the surface of the patient, who, in some cases, may receive
the treatment sitting in a chair rather than lying on a couch.
The Orthovoltage machine will be used mainly for small skin cancers of
various types and ophthalmic cancers, for example. Ophthalmology is an
area of particular expertise at the Western Infirmary.
A special Radio Nuclide Treatment Room for the type of radiotherapy
treatments given as injections or drinks of radioactive material, has
also been designed at the Beatson, while the basement area houses the
complex support facilities required to run a modern radiotherapy
department, where every machine is calibrated and checked daily, before
treatment commences.
Another invaluable facility brought by Phase 5, has been a film
processor which means that the Beatson can process all its own films at
any hour of the day or night, with considerable savings on time.
Mowlem Scotland has been the main contractor for the project, while
the architects, Wylie Shanks has been closely involved with each phase
of development at the Beatson since it opened in 1988.
Dr Hamish Porter, clinical physicist, who, along with Bruce Barnett,
business manager of the Beatson Oncology Centre Clinical Directorate,
has spearheaded the project, smiles as he says: ''We are awkward
customers for the architect. The walls of the building are 1.5m thick,
of high density concrete.''
The old lead doors of yesterday have been replaced in most cases by
what is called a maze corridor, leading to each linear accelerator, the
scatter of radiation being absorbed within the massively thick walls.
Monitor lights alert the control desk should anyone pass into the maze
when a machine is on, and it automatically switches off instantly.
The Beatson's clinical director is Dr Tim Habeshaw, and Professor Ann
Barrett has the chair of Radiation Oncology while the chair of Medical
Oncology is held by Professor Stanley Kaye.
From the medical point of view, the bringing together of patients and
facilities on one site at the Beatson is considered to be much more
satisfactory, making it easier to keep track of patients involved in
clinical trials, when they are all being treated under one roof, with
the results in the same place.
Professor Kaye commented that the Cancer Research Campaign, which is
funding the clinical trials unit based at the Western, welcomes the move
to one site because from their point of view, it will improve efficiency
and therefore the potential results from the research.

CHAMPIONSHIP golf returns to Carnoustie -- in many people's view the
finest links in Britain -- after an absence of 20 years this week, but
opinions are divided on how the famous course has been set up.
Ryder Cup Swede Joakim Haeggman told tournament director Mike Stewart
after his first practice round that Carnoustie was the best test he had
faced in his six years on the European Tour.
But Glasgow's Adam Hunter, a winner at the course in his Tartan Tour
days, thinks they have ''ruined'' the eighteenth, which has been changed
from a 444-yard par 4 into a 512-yard par 5.
Hunter said: ''It's destroyed a great par 4. Whereas you used to hit a
drive over the burn and then a two-iron, now it's such a big carry over
the burn that it's not worth the risk. Instead, you hit two three-woods
and then have something like an eight-iron to the green. It's a shame.''
Stewart confirmed, however, that some of the tees could be moved
forward depending on the wind. He said: ''The feedback so far has been
fantastic. The key to setting up the course is to make it a fair test
''You could make it so that a 76 would be the best score of the day if
there's a strong wind. But I don't want the players leaving here saying
I don't ever want to come back.''

ROBIN Waddell, who was the youngest-ever chairman of the Scottish
floor of the Stock Exchange back in 1976, has handed over his
chairmanship of Glasgow-based family stockbroking firm Speirs &amp; Jeffrey
to brother Alan.
One of the pillars of the Scottish financial community, Robin Waddell,
63, has headed Speirs &amp; Jeffrey for 16 years.
What strikes him most, looking back over his 35-year career, are the
enormous changes which have taken place on the stockbroking scene.
Robin Waddell said: ''It has been an absolutely fascinating 35 years.
When I started, everybody knew everybody in the Stock Exchange. Now I
don't suppose you see another stockbroker for months.''
When it comes to sobriety and prudence, Speirs &amp; Jeffrey must be on a
par with Bank of Scotland. Robin Waddell believes his firm's low-profile
attitude helped it through the 1987 stock-market ''melee''.
With Allied Provincial Securities in the process of being taken over
by Greig Middleton's London-based parent, King &amp; Shaxson, Speirs &amp;
Jeffrey will be one of the last independent Scottish brokers.
Although Alan Waddell is only a year younger than his predecessor,
Robin Waddell believes he will head the firm for about 10 years.
The youngest Waddell brother, Gordon, 58, was capped 18 times for
Scotland at rugby and also played for the British Lions.
After a spell in South Africa, where he was an MP, Gordon Waddell
returned to the UK and is now chairman of waste management group Shanks
&amp; McEwan.
The tradition of family succession at Speirs &amp; Jeffrey could well
continue. Alan Waddell's 30-year-old son, Graham, is currently a
director.
Robin Waddell will continue to look after clients who have looked to
him for advice for 35 years.

IT HAS been a long time coming, but the brave new world of
house-buying has arrived. Forget those fears about selling your existing
home -- the stories of properties stuck on the market for months and
months as advertising bills go through the roof, the spectre of upset
prices, talk of that dirty word ''bridging'' -- now you can buy your
dream home safe in the knowledge that you just can't lose. In fact, you
can end up quids in.
For quality builder Adam (Scotland) has just launched its unique House
Exchange Plan which takes all the worry and stress out of moving into
its new homes. The plan is available for a limited period only to
clients purchasing one of its exclusive houses at Henderland Gate, a new
#6.5m development of luxury flats and villas in tranquil surroundings
just off the Switchback in Bearsden.
After reserving one of the villas, the client's own home is valued by
an independent valuer and a mutually acceptable minimum part-exchange
price is agreed with Adam.
Once missives for the purchase of the new home are concluded, your
property will be marketed by a leading estate agent, with all
advertising costs and agent fees to be borne by Adam. Should your
property be sold for more than the agreed minimum value, you keep all
the proceeds. Should it sell for less, or not at all, Adam will still
pay you the agreed minimum price in part-exchange for your new home.
''We are giving the client the confidence to go ahead and put their
house on the market because we are picking up the estate agents' fee and
advertising and providing a minimum fall-back. It's a no-lose
situation,'' said David Nelson, managing director of Adam (Scotland).
''People are worried about spending weeks and weeks advertising with
the costs going up, worried about two mortgages. What we are doing is
underpinning that. We are saying we will take it on the chin.
''What we have found is that people have been coming on to the site
for a considerable period of time and have obviously taken the view that
the site wasn't ready yet, but now it's make your mind up time.''
The offer is only available this month and next.
The development comprises a range of two and three-bedroom flats (28
in all) and 15 four and five-bedroom detached homes. All are built to
the highest standards offering exceptionally spacious accommodation and
a high level of specification. People have now begun to move into the
first of two phases of flats which was finished recently.
''We have now commenced the landscaping and final works on the first
phase of flats which give a good idea of the standard the whole
development is going to achieve,'' said David Nelson.
''Up to now people have only had the development model or a brochure
-- although we have been selling ahead of completion. But people
interested in the next phase of the development can actually come to see
the finished product.
''The flats have been selling so quickly that we haven't had time to
have a showflat, but we do have a completed flat which people can look
round.''
The second and final phase of 14 apartments is now under construction
for entry in spring next year. Like the first phase, all have garages,
parking, and balconies and there is a video door entry system.
On the house front, the first residents will move in at the end of
this month. The show home, a five-bedroomed ''Carnoustie'' detached
villa with interior design by Decorum of Sauchiehall Street, opened in
March.
The rooms are generally much larger than usual, and the double doors
into the lounge, the patio doors in the dining room, the generous
hallways on both ground and upper level, the large ensuites, and the
extensive landscaped gardens all serve to give a feeling of space. A
choice of stylish bathrooms and fully equipped quality kitchens --
designed to maximise on space and storage -- are included in the price.
The popularity of the development has much to do with its location --
nestling on a secluded wooded hill at the end of Henderland Road, with
splendid views over the surrounding area.
Kitchens are fully fitted. Each flat is supplied with satellite
television, with an aerial point in every room. The villas have living
flame fireplaces and patios leading to the gardens, and the developers
offer a carpets and curtains package.
Said David Nelson: ''When people move in, all they have to do is put
their furniture where they want it, plug in the television and relax.
Because we are a small, specialist company, we can build in other
requirements. The company believes in traditional value and space, and
we are pleased that the buying public obviously agrees.''
Henderland Gate is close to shopping and transport facilities as well
as being within easy reach of the city centre. Prices are from #98,000
for a two-bedroom flat and from #198,000 for the Braemar four-bedroom
detached villa.

SWISS Alex Zuelle won yesterday's ninth stage -- but Miguel Indurain
again was the real winner as he strengthened his bid for a fifth
consecutive Tour de France.
Zuelle's magnificent 37.5-mile Alpine breakaway -- most of it in
searing heat and on his own -- to win the first mountain section was a
great feat. But it forced Indurain to dig deep into his reserves and
prove once again that he has no peer in modern cycling.
When Zuelle led by almost five minutes going into the final
10.625-mile climb to the mountain-top resort of La Plagne, Indurain had
cause to be worried.
The Swiss had started the day ninth overall -- 4min 29sec behind --
but was in position to take over the race leader's yellow jersey.
However, Indurain left the mountain specialists trailing as he reduced
the gap.
The exhausted Swiss won the 100-mile run from Le Grand Bornand in 4hr
41min 18sec, but Indurain was second, reducing the arrears to 2min 2sec,
with all his other rivals out of sight and out of contention.
Pavel Tonkov of Russia was third, more than four minutes behind
Zuelle, and Indurain's main rival, Tony Rominger of Switzerland, lost
more than six minutes on his compatriot and four minutes to the
Spaniard.
Zuelle moved up to second overall, 2-27 behind Indurain and the only
rider now in a position to offer anything of a challenge, with the rest
around six minutes or more adrift.
The bespectacled Swiss, who was seen as a potential Tour winner after
a brilliant Paris-Nice victory two years ago, said: ''It's a big day for
me. I was fortunate to be in the right group on the first climb and then
I found myself on my own. I told myself I had to go for it.''
Indurain said he was a bit apprehensive about today's stage to l'Alpe
d'Huez, the toughest test this year, with three daunting climbs. But
seemingly only accident, injury, or illness can stop his triumph in
Paris on July 23.
Leading stage placings: 1, Alex Zuelle (Switzerland) ONCE 4hr 41min
18sec; 2, Miguel Indurain (Spain) Banesto 2min 2sec behind; 3, Pavel

SUMMER transfer spending has rocketed to record heights of #60m -- and
all but a few million pounds of the sum has been splashed out by
Premiership clubs.
It is the clearest indication yet that the gap between football's
elite and the Endsleigh League has become a grand canyon, as the
Premiership prepares for a fourth season on the back of the #300m Sky TV
deal. The top transfers:
#8.5m: Stan CollymoreNottm Forest to Liverpool.
#7.5m: Paul InceManchester United to Inter-Milan.
#7.5m: Dennis BergkampInter-Milan to Arsenal.
#6m: Les FerdinandQPR to Newcastle.
#4.75m: David PlattSampdoria to Arsenal.
#4.5m: Chris ArmstrongCrystal Palace to Spurs.
#4m: Warren BartonWimbledon to Newcastle.
#3.5m: Savo MilosevicPartizan Belgrade to Aston Villa.
#3.25m: Mark DraperLeicester to Aston Villa.
#2.5m: Gareth SouthgateCrystal Palace to Aston Villa.
#2.5m: David GinolaParis St Germain to Newcastle.
#1.5m: Mark HughesManchester United to Chelsea.
Echoing Alex Smith's thoughts, Tranmere manager John King yesterday
warned that the big money being spent on transfers and wages in the
Premiership could sound the death-knell for a number of small clubs in
England.
Tranmere this week bought 40-goal Wrexham striker Gary Bennett for
#300,000 -- a sum that would scarcely cover David Platt's wages for five
months. The ripples of the big-money transfers are being felt in the
Endsleigh League, where the record fee stands at the #1.85m Wolves paid
for Bradford's Dean Richards.

DEAR GAZZA,
Welcome to Glasgow, city of a thousand delights, most of them
forbidden, and of a million football experts. There are wee guys here
who know how to pierce the heart of the Brazilian defence, and can show
you how without ever leaving their chair or, indeed, removing the fag
from their lips.
Wha's like us? Gey few, and none of them come frae Edinburgh.
I know you originally hail from Newcastle and that you have sampled
soccer fervour in London and in Italy. You may expect to find the same
kind of enthusiasm in your new abode -- in fact, you will never have
experienced anything like the intensity of the Glasgow fans. The first
Monday after you've lost you'll know it.
Put it this way. If the supporters had a choice of being with Sharon
Stone or yourself no amount of crossing legs would swing the vote her
way.
There are two religions in this town and both of them have footballers
as their gods. As a Teddy Bear, as opposed to a Tim, you will never want
to be seen in the colour green ever again.
I kid you not, pal, if you have even a single pair of lime-coloured
shorts, just send them round to the Sally Ann. Blond hair goes well with
blue, which is no doubt why you had it done.
As you play, the Ibrox choir will provide the background with a few
homespun folk songs in which His Holiness, Fenian blood and the Irish
Republican Army will regularly feature. Don't make jokes about that. The
folk who sing them have a very limited sense of humour.
You will, however, have to stand some ribbing about Rangers'
invincibility in Scotland. Like: How did the Gers go the day? Drew 0/0.
Who missed their penalty?
I note that your agent Mr Mel Stein is already upset about the
unofficial Gazza merchandise which is on sale. He is facing serious
grief. I fear your face and nickname will decorate everything from
kickers to knickers and I doubt if you can expect royalties.
What he can expect are invitations to weddings, christenings,
funerals, dinners -- marginally less interesting than funerals --
supporters nights, television shows, quizzes, boxing shows, race
meetings and jamborees. I just hope Mel knows when to say no and doesn't
need the 10 per cent too much.
I am glad to read you are taking it easy with the demon. There are
about half a million people who would love to buy you a drink, and that
is just on the first night. And when it comes to the bevvy, Paul, you
are not even in the same premier division as these lads.
You will enjoy playing in Scotland and you will win a lot, because
Rangers are light blue years ahead of anything else we have. That is not
to say your path will be petal strewn, or that the road to goal is lined
with gentlemen.
A few years ago Mr Graeme Souness, supposed by many to be a more
mature man than yourself, came to Ibrox, having been an outstanding
success in England and in Italy. In his first game in a blue shirt he
was sent off before half-time.
Even as I write, there are hard men from Brechin to Berwick just
waiting for the day they have the opportunity to have a niggle at the
great Gazza. A man on television opined that you would be less tightly
marked in Scotland than you were in Italy. Aye, but more marked perhaps
and certainly more narked here.
You are going to have to be something of a saint -- and the other lot
have bagged most of them.
Don't ever cry. Not even if you are the player who missed the vital
penalty in the sudden death shoot-out at the European Cup final,
particularly not if you head into your own net at Parkhead. The
Glaswegian can be tolerant. But not about greeting.
If you stick to these few simple rules, live like a Wee Free minister
-- well, I was going to say monk, but they are not in your camp -- smile
at Ally's practical jokes, do what Walter tells you and never got on the
wrong side of Archie you'll be grand. This is a city which takes people
to its heart and half of it is in love with you already.
You will, certainly, bring a vivid splash of colour to our national
game and I for one am delighted to see you here.
As Rikki Fulton -- they'll tell you about him -- might say, this is
your great opporchancity. Glaswegians invented football, don't let
anyone tell you differently. Play it their way and you will have riches
money cannot buy.
Yours in anticipation,
BRIAN MEEK

Stan Collymore: his #8.5m move from Nottingham Forest to Liverpool is
the highest transfer fee in a #60m summer-spending spree involving
England's Premiership clubs.
AS TRANSFER fees hit record heights in Britain -- the #4.3m Rangers
have paid for Paul Gascoigne has been little more than a footnote to the
#60m spree which England's Premiership clubs have embarked on -- the
longest-serving Scottish manager, Alex Smith, admitted that he sees no
end to the money madness.
Smith, who has managed Stenhousemuir, Stirling Albion, St Mirren,
Aberdeen, and now Clyde, is chairman of the Scottish Managers and
Coaches Association, and last night he claimed: ''I don't see things
changing at all as long as the money keeps pouring into the game. There
are so many millions of pounds coming in from television and sponsorship
that the top clubs are simply spending it all on players . . .
''It has become a circus and, in my opinion, it will become an even
bigger circus over the next few years.''
But, as that happens, Smith foresees casualties in the domestic game,
both here and in other countries. He stresses: ''The gulf between the
big clubs and the smaller sides will simply grow and grow. I cannot see
anything other than the major, big-city clubs becoming more and more
powerful.
''Everything is in their favour. The little clubs will simply have to
find another level and, for some of them, this kind of transfer
inflation could be a death knell.''
Smith, when he was at Stirling Albion, discovered his own young
players, developed their skills, and then, when it was necessary for
survival, sold them on to bigger clubs.
John Colquhoun went to Celtic, Brian Grant to Aberdeen, and John
Philliben to Doncaster Rovers, and from the money brought into the club
Smith was able to keep Stirling Albion on a sound financial footing.
At St Mirren he was pressured into selling Ian Ferguson to Rangers but
got the kind of money -- close to #900,000 -- which again gave the
Paisley club breathing space from the financial problems which have
since engulfed them.
At Aberdeen, Smith saw the other side of the transfer business when
the fans seemed to want the club to lash out the kind of money which
emanates from Ibrox almost every close season.
''That was not possible,'' he claims today, ''and I don't think it's
any more possible now. If Aberdeen went down that road then the club
would go bankrupt. The fans have to accept that what might be okay for
Rangers, or Celtic, simply does not work out for the rest of the clubs
in Scotland.''
Indeed, Smith believes the day is coming when Rangers, and, perhaps,
their Old Firm rivals Celtic, will have two teams. They will have a No.1
side which will compete in some kind of Super League and a lesser side
which will play in Scotland.
He insists: ''Rangers have a huge financial clout and if they go
through to the Champions' League this year, then the gap between them
and the other clubs will be even greater.
''There is not a lot the others can do about that. Good luck to them.
They have gone for the big profile and they have backed that with a
massive investment in players which benefits the whole Scottish game.
When you have lads such as Gascoigne and Laudrup playing regularly, then
the whole country is lifted.
''I can see a world league coming. Quite honestly, we used to talk
about a British League, but that has been over-taken. People now talk
about a European League and that comes closer and closer. But the way
things are accelerating in the game I think we will go beyond that by
the turn of the century. I can see clubs from South America taking part
in a league.
''Sponsors and major television companies would back it and the money
would go even higher than it has reached now. That's why I don't see any
brake being put on the money being spent.
''Okay, if transfer fees are 'abolished' by the European Court then
that could alter things, but I just don't see deals between clubs going
out of the window.
''Small clubs just could not survive. They would die. And I cannot see
that being allowed to happen.
''What the major players in all of this have to remember is that
football is still a game. When that ball starts rolling again at the
start of the season maybe we will get back to realising that.
''That is what it means to the fans. I know they need big names, and
bigger names, and still bigger names. But unless the little clubs are
there to bring on young players, then where will it all end?
''We all have to live. It's how we are going to live which concerns
me.''
At home here, we have to realise that Rangers and David Murray are
playing for huge stakes -- only Celtic perhaps can match them, if they
can get their act together -- and so a different agenda has to be in
mind.
Smith's world vision may not be far from reality in an ever-shrinking
world and in a game which is becoming reliant on the cash available from
sponsors and television companies.
The Sky cash has given the English Premiership the riches they are now
splashing out on players. That seems to be the way ahead, whether we
like it or not.

CLYDE skippers filled the top places in all but one of the classes
with a Scottish presence at Bangor Week yesterday.
Alex Duffus extended his Class 0 leadership with a comprehensive
five-minute win, steering his Sigma 400, Eclipse V, with Jonathan
Anderson's First 42s7 Duckwall Pooley in second, and Peter Fairley's
Sigma 400 Pinocchio completing the Clyde monopoly of top three places.
In murky drizzle, and a stiff south-easterly wind on Belfast Lough,
Duffus gained considerably on the penultimate circuit as the race
leaders followed a track into the mist given by the Welsh boat,
Megalopolis.
All three pacemakers had to free sheets and lost two minutes each,
while the Eclipse crew's navigation proved to be pinpoint accurate.
In Class 1, John Corson's J35 Salamander XII had a 300-yard lead by
the first mark of the Olympic triangle, going left to use the ebb-tide
to its full advantage then sailing on to win by four minutes in the
eight-boat J35 class.
The Sigma 33 class also fell victim to a Scottish monopoly with David
Wilson's Helensburgh-based Vendaval winning.
Angus Spence's Kip Marina-based First Class 8, The Black Pig, remains
the regatta's only unbeaten boat and leads the Sportboat division with a
third consecutive triumph yesterday. Results (Scottish unless stated):
RACE 3. Class 0 -- 1, Eclipse V (A Duffus) 3hrs 17mins 51secs; 2,
Duckwall Pooley (J Anderson) 3-22-56; 3, Pinocchio VII (P and D Fairley)
3-23-11.
Class 1 -- 1, Salamander 12 (J Corson) 3-24-19; 2, Jacana (M Flowers,
Ulster) 3-28-05; 3, J Mags (G Newburn, Pwlheli) 3-17-39.
Class 2 -- 1, Gumdrop (T and D Andrews, Strangford Lough) 2-47-14; 2,
Supertramp IV (D Lyons) 2-49-34; 3, Material Gain (T Halliwell, Ulster)
2-49-59; 5, Starkicker II (K Macdonald) 2-49-36; 6, Naiad III (J Kelly)

SCOTTISH credit unions have welcomed proposals, laid before Parliament
yesterday, which would give them more freedom in the way they operate.
Scotland is home to about 100 credit unions -- groups of people with a
common interest who pool their savings and provide low-interest loans to
members. These unions have combined assets of about #20m.
Strathclyde Regional Council Employees' Credit Union, made up of about
10,400 past and present council employees, is the largest in the UK. It
has assets of about #5.8m.
Its chairman, Michael Davidson, said: ''Some of the proposals are
tremendous for the credit union movement.''
The deregulation proposals, if they are passed, would allow
community-based unions of residents to expand to include people who work
in the area, through a relaxation of the definition of the ''common
bond'' which must bind them.
Credit unions would also be able to make much larger loans to members,
repayable over a longer period.
Currently, unsecured loans are capped at #5000 and must be repaid
within two years.
The Government wants to enable credit unions to make individual loans
of up to 1[1/2]% of their assets. This would allow many of the larger,
industrial unions to provide loans of more than #20,000, although some
would probably not wish to go quite so high.
However, if credit unions do obtain authority to provide unsecured
loans of more than #5000, payable over four years instead of two, they
would be able to compete strongly with the big finance houses,
particularly regarding the provision of loans for car purchases.
John Lebrocq, treasurer of Strathclyde Police (Federation) Credit
Union, said the changes would be ''tremendously significant''.
He added: ''It would almost change the top-end scenario completely.''
Made up of about 3500 past and present policemen and civilian
employees, the Glasgow-based police credit union has assets of more than
#2.5m.
Other proposed changes to the Credit Unions Act 1979 include an
increase in the maximum number of members from 5000 to 10,000. Credit
unions, like that of Strathclyde Regional Council, can currently exceed
the membership limit with the permission of the Registrar of Friendly
Societies.
Peter Bussy, of the London-based Association of British Credit Unions,
said: ''I think these changes will be seen as acknowledgments of the
success of the movement, particularly in the Strathclyde area.''
Angela Knight, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: ''Credit
unions have told the Government that they have too many restrictions. We
are in the business of helping, not hindering them.
''They have asked for the changes we are giving them, using the
deregulatory route now available. I want to see credit unions grow and
bureaucracy shrink, while keeping the necessary protection for
members.''

* BRITISH Plaster Board Industries has bought a wastepaper firm based
at Kilsyth, near Glasgow, to help feed its paperboard factory in
Aberdeen. BPB's wholly-owned subsidiary BPB Paper &amp; Packaging would not
to say how much it had paid for Kelvin Salvage (Kilsyth), which employs
around 40 people and collects about 450 tonnes of paper per week.
Martin Kleiweg, the managing director of BPB Paper &amp; Packaging's
wastepaper division, said the acquisition of the company from Jim and
Alan Patrick was a strategic move for BPB.
The company owned seven wastepaper collection firms in England, but
until now it did not own one in Scotland, he noted. BPB's paperboard
plant in Aberdeen consumes about 4500 tonnes of wastepaper per week and
Kelvin Salvage has been a regular supplier.
''We have had long dealings with these people over the years and we
know them well,'' Mr Kleiweg said.
He said BPB had no plans to acquire any other wastepaper collection
firms in Scotland, where its Aberdeen plant is mainly fed by local
authorities and contract suppliers.

SCOTLAND is a notable exception in the housing market according to the
latest house prices review from the Halifax building society as the
English market remains in the doldrums. There are strong arguments for
specific measures to stimulate demand, says the society.
In the quarter ended June 30, Scottish house prices rose by 3.4%,
resulting in annual inflation of 1.4%. This contrasts starkly with a
quarterly rise in the UK of only 0.4% and an annual decrease of 1.6%.
The Halifax says that first-time buyers in the UK are paying 0.5% less
than this time last year, but in Scotland they are paying 2.3% more,
''indicating a healthy scenario and confidence among new entrants to the
market''.
New house-buyers in the UK are now paying an average price of #66,747,
down 1% on last year, but in Scotland they are paying a higher #72,826,
which is almost 1% up.

Ross Finlay drives a small car with room for manoeuvre
EVER since it was put on the market in 1993, the Vauxhall Corsa has
been the class leader in terms of interior space. Its ''cab forward''
layout means that an unusually high proportion of the wheelbase is
available for the passenger cabin, and the high roofline provides far
more generous headroom, front and rear, than you find in most supermini
rivals.
The class-leading passenger space continues in the current models,
which prove the old motor industry rule that a manufacturer's first shot
at any production car is really just that -- a first shot. These days,
it is not so much that the first 10,000 customers are unpaid test
drivers, as that each design has dozens of detail improvements planned
for later years, even as the first examples go on sale.
For its size, the Corsa has a strong and well protected bodyshell.
There is a robust general structure with front and rear crumple zones,
and, while steel bars are fitted in the doors, these would not be nearly
so effective in a crash without their inforced side pillars and sills
which are standard throughout the Corsa range.
Most manufacturers have their own specialities, and Vauxhall has a
fixation about door locks. The Corsa's are sturdy units, but the latest
cars also have deadlocks fitted for anti-theft reasons, and the GLS I
have been driving includes a sensor which automatically unlocks them all
in the event of a major impact.
Another Vauxhall preoccupation is airbags. The Corsa was one of the
superminis which led the way in being fitted as standard with a bigger
driver's side airbag than the regulations insist upon, and the
extra-cost passenger's version is far bigger still, taking account of
the fact that, in a head-on smash, there is more uninterrupted space in
front of the passenger than in front of the person at the wheel.
The designers have made a neat job of fitting in the left-side airbag
while retaining a proper glove locker. As usual, though, here is another
Vauxhall which scores a minus point for not having any tilt adjustment
on an airbag-equipped steering wheel.
I was driving a 1.4-litre five-door GLS at #9935. This is a slightly
confusing car, because it has GLS badges on the sides -- describing the
trim and equipment level -- and an Si badge at the rear. That one simply
points to the latest twin-cam 16-valve 1389cc Ecotec engine. The new
power unit is a more powerful, more efficient and more economical design
than the one it replaces.
Peaking at 90bhp, it will take the Corsa to 60mph in about 10.5
seconds and go on to a test track speed of 112mph. Fuel consumption
figures of 54mpg at 56mph and 32mpg around town are up by about two mpg
each on what was possible with the previous engine, while the 39mpg
likely at 75mph is about the same. Torque is noticeably improved, and
the whole response of the engine is better.
I thought at first that the steering wheel was too big, but the fact
that its rim comes below the windscreen bottom line, and the driver's
seat height can be adjusted, means that the driving position is not bad.
The Corsa has attractive, rounded fascia edges and one of the neatest
little digital display units in the business. I am never sure of the
point of having a date display, which vanishes when the same space goes
on to radio information, but I suppose it is quite inexpensive to
provide.
Non-sporting Corsas are usually safe but not brilliant handlers. The
GLS is just the same, although the latest gas-filled shock absorbers are
an improvement, and I suspect that, as another Vauxhall recently showed,
you could perk up any Corsa's handling by increasing the tyre pressures.
Of course, that would inevitably harden the ride, which the new shock
absorbers, with standard tyre pressures, have mildly improved. Most
owners will stick with the manufacturer's settings.

THE interest-rate conundrum took a fresh turn yesterday with the UK
industrial production figures for May.
These showed a slowdown for the second consecutive month, wrongfooting
financial markets which had been projecting an increase.
Industrial production fell 0.1% month on month to give a year-on-year
increase of 1.4%, while manufacturing output was also down 0.1% on the
month for a year-on-year rise of 1.3% (against 2.6% in April), both well
below market forecasts.
Analysts considered that while the pace of growth is shown to be
slowing it is certainly not collapsing, part of the explanation being
that companies are paring back on stock levels after last year's
involuntary build-up.
Nevertheless, it is fashionable for economic data to be seen in terms
of whether it supports the Governor of the Bank of England's viewpoint
that interest rates should be raised to squeeze inflationary pressures
or the Chancellor's view that this is unnecessary and could even prove
damaging to recovery as growth falls to a more sustainable level.
The June factory gate prices on Monday were widely interpreted as
supporting the Governor whereas yesterday's industrial production
out-turn was considered a boost to the Clarke camp. The next monetary
meeting between the two is on July 27 when the feeling is that the
Chancellor will again leave well alone.
What is puzzling commentators is the divergence between official data
and survey data. Although the gap between the two has narrowed slightly
in recent months, business surveys still indicate much greater buoyancy
in manufacturing output.
David Walton, economist at Goldman Sachs, considers that given the
reliable track record of business surveys, it is very difficult to judge
whether the economy has slowed to a sustainable pace.
James Capel's Adam Cole says that the latest figures show
manufacturing output has essentially been flat since the autumn. He also
says that reconciling the figures with the much more bullish CBI survey
remains very difficult though he reckons the evidence is growing that
the Central Statistical Office (CSO) is over-deflating the data turnover
it collects due to over-recording of export price inflation.
If this interpretation is correct, it would mean, according to Mr
Cole, that the firm upwards trend in manufacturing output apparent
through the course of last year would have been maintained into the
first half of this year.
Meanwhile, though, the latest data does heighten the Government's
dilemma on base rates and will magnify divisions between the Chancellor
(who will focus on the output data) and the Governor who, in turn, will
focus on the producer price data as a lead indicator of retail price
inflation.
Financial markets, for the moment at any rate, are assuming that there
will be no upward hike in UK interest rates, a contributing factor along
with others such as takeover speculation, to the present relative
buoyancy in share markets.
The softening of interest rates overseas and some suggestion,
admittedly in a minority, that the Bundesbank could lower rates tomorrow
also makes for a better ambiance although not necessarily an influence
on the UK domestic scene as regards the inflation debate.

ARGYLL is to extend the trial of its self-scanning system to the Perth
branch of Safeway and several other branches.
The system has been tried for a number of months at the Solihull
store. It met a ready acceptance from customers so now the trial is to
be extended to three more stores, including Perth.
Customers are given a small portable scanner and they record their
purchases as they take them off the shelf and put them in their trolley.
The idea is to avoid check-out queues and the need for customers to
put goods into the trolley and take them out again for scanning at the
check-out, only to be returned to the trolley for onward movement to the
customer's car.
Chief executive Colin Smith told shareholders of the extension of the
trial at the annual meeting, at which Argyll revealed that Safeway's
sales in the first 14 weeks of the year were 12.5% ahead, comprising
5.8% from new stores and 6.7% from existing units.
Adjustment for the different timing of Easter left like-for-like sales
up 5.5%, of which 3% was volume.
Chairman Sir Alistair Grant said that gross margins were somewhat
below last year but they anticipated an improvement, leading to full
recovery in margins for the full year.
He added that the group's Safeway 2000 programme was making good
progress.
''We expect the benefits of the profound changes we are making to our
business to flow through strongly during the second half of the year,''
Sir Alistair told shareholders.

NEW YORK: The world's population could more than double by 2050 if the
goals of last year's key Cairo summit are ignored, a UN report claimed
yesterday. It said that by its most optimistic estimate the current
population of 5.7 billion will rise to 7.9 billion before the middle of
next century. But by 2050 it could have soared close to 12 billion if
there was no success in improving contraception.

WHATEVER happens in later life, every journalist has a soft spot for
the newspaper where he first worked, learned to cope with crises, ask
rude questions, crawl to important contacts -- and on top of these
youthful delights discovered that he was quite often expected to get
drunk at his employer's expense. The place where I learned these things
was the Scotsman, and though I left it long ago I have never ceased to
follow its fortunes. Despite the brave face it has put on, those
fortunes have not been happy.
In one way they show the modern multimedia corporation at its worst.
The story is well known of how Lord Thomson, the elder, acquired the
Scotsman as his first British title in 1953, buying from the Findlays of
Aberlour who had owned it for a century. Since it was a morning paper,
which therefore had to be produced in the afternoon, and since the
Findlays weren't very good after lunch, a certain decline in its quality
had become obvious.
But the outgoing proprietors' convivial habits had shocked
strait-laced Edinburgh not nearly so much as the vulgar commercialism of
the incoming one. Thomson found an experienced Glaswegian editor,
Alastair Dunnett. He put news on the front page. He set up things like
advertising and circulation departments. He ran the paper, in other
words, as a business. The last of the Findlays had, however, extracted
from him one solemn undertaking, one constraint on his freedom of
action; that he would never sell the Scotsman to an Englishman.
Nowadays we can only smile at such innocence. It had simply not
occurred to Findlay that the Scotsman could be other than the summit of
a colonial's ambition. He was incapable of imagining that this purchase
would be the initial step towards construction of a global empire.
Thomson kept his word, but that did not prevent the loss of the paper's
independence inside a vast commercial conglomerate in reality negating
the condition which the patriotic Findlay set.
Still, all was relatively well while Thomson lived. Mean and
calculating as he was, he retained, like a journalist, a soft spot for
his first real newspaper, and always saw it right. From what we know of
the second Lord Thomson, who seldom appears to venture furth of Toronto,
even that degree of humanity is wanting. This is not the place to
speculate on the origin of his evangelical religion or his horror of
flies, except to say that they seem to point to an odd upbringing.
The results, since he took over one quarter-century ago, have been
dire. The Scotsman enjoyed no higher status than the local rag he owned
in Moose Jaw. Its editor had to answer to executives in London, who in
turn answered to executives in New York, who in turn answered to
Thomson. To all these people, the Scotsman was just another regional
newspaper, distinguished only by its ridiculous pretensions to be a
national newspaper, which had to be ground down. Despite sturdy
resistance by its staff, that is what has happened.
Clearly some sort of crisis has been on the way for a while. Though
the Scotsman and its sisters are profitable, they have not been allowed
to invest in maintaining their journalistic standards. Everything has to
be done on a shoestring. The readers have been noticing, and circulation
has fallen. But this may be a blessing in disguise. Thomson is
interested only in organs with growth potential. The Scotsman no longer
comes into that category, and so is offered for sale.
Different views might be held of the range of potential bidders, but
hardly anything could be worse than the regime of the second Lord
Thomson under which the Scotsman has had to struggle on. That is
certainly how I should feel if I were still on its staff. I would hope
for things to improve, that it would be taken over by people who are not
only willing to invest in it, but also understand the community,
national or local, which it serves, and its importance to diversity and
choice in that community. That means, in the first instance, Scots.
Their personal opinions would strike me as a lesser matter.
So I have to disagree with my fellow columnists, Brian Wilson and Alex
Salmond, who, in public statements, have appointed themselves Chief
Dinosaurs in this affair and entered various caveats against the
Scotsman falling prey to Professor Ross Harper's Tory consortium. On the
contrary, I think that would be healthy for the Scotsman and for
Scotland.
Probably as a result of its own utter dependency, the Scotsman remains
a mouthpiece for Scotland's dependency culture. It never doubts that
there is an easy answer to every problem, that the answer consists in
the Government throwing money at the problem, in other words that money
grows on trees and the rest of the world owes Scotland a living.
In fact it takes the same point of view as used to appear regularly in
the columns of The Herald where, especially during the high noon of
Thatcherism, profit was regarded as prima-facie evidence of
misdemeanour. The Herald was at that time submerged in an enormous
multinational too. But having to make its own way after its management
buy-out has wrought quite a difference. I would expect similar
enlightenment to overcome an independent Scotsman. In fact, all our
opinion-formers might ponder the fact that though in Scotland capitalism
is usually depicted as the enemy, here is another example of its ability
to work in our favour. At least, potentially, it gives proof of how the
sytem is open to everyone, not only in principle but also in practice,
not just to giant corporations but to all with the courage and
self-reliance to test themselves in the market.

THE Medea of South Carolina, Susan Smith, is on trial this week for
murdering her two children. The Californian Othello, O J Simpson, has
put his mother on the stand to say what a fine man he is.
A third and almost equally famous trial also begins this week (though
there is no literary metaphor to go with it). The defendant is accused
of kidnapping and murdering a girl in San Francisco.
The case is celebrated because the man had just been released from
jail, after serving a sentence for child abuse, when he allegedly
climbed into a house in the suburbs and kidnapped Polly Klaas from her
bedroom. If police had put out a description more quickly, they might
have caught him and saved the girl.
This is a big and violent country, so there are always plenty of
notable cases to occupy Court TV, the cable channel that broadcasts
trials. There is a ritual in these things, with camera crews, satellite
dishes, caravans of equipment, and hordes of commentators outside the
courthouse.
It's a growth industry. Young, personable law graduates, with a few
years criminal law experience, can make far more standing in front of a
camera than they ever will as public defenders of run-of-the-mill
criminals. Come to think of it, old, frazzled lawyers do equally well.
Lead counsel are chosen for their media skills as much as for their
forensic abilities.
There are roughly 23,500 murders a year in the United States. The
number has been dropping recently from its high point in the 1980s.
Presumably it is a demographic phenomenon: there are fewer young men
between 18 and 25 and therefore fewer murders.
There are also more young men behind bars, and that certainly affects
the crime stats. Of course no-one can say whether the national interest,
whatever that is, is better served by locking up one million young men
than it would be by providing all young men with a decent education.
What one can say is that the death penalty has nothing to do with it.
Susan Smith is alleged to have stood on the side of the lake, watching
the car with her two small children in it roll down into the water. She
was not deterred.
Nor was the alleged murderer of the San Francisco girl, nor O J
Simpson. In that case the prosecutors decided not to ask for the death
penalty, partly because the jury might hesitate to convict anyone so
celebrated if it meant his execution, partly because of a general
feeling that a crime passionelle is somehow less blameworthy than other
murders.
Of course it might be argued that infanticide is also so aberrant that
it should not evoke the death penalty. The state attorney-general in
South Carolina does not concur. He wants to execute her -- and is taking
immense pains to ensure that she does not kill herself first.
There is a murderous, retributive streak in America. The day of the
Oklahoma City bombing the attorney-general, Janet Reno, after consulting
the President, announced that the feds would seek the death penalty for
those responsible. The President's popularity shot up immediately.
There are 3000 people on death row, and recent statutes increasing the
number of capital crimes should push that up substantially. At the same
time, Congress is trying to limit the number of appeals against capital
convictions, in the hopes that the process can be speeded up and the
costs cut.
It costs far more to execute a man than to lock him up for life.
Congress wants to reduce that anomaly by ensuring that all appeals are
concluded in a year. At the moment it takes eight or 10 years, sometimes
much longer, before the very last appeal is refused and the murderer at
last executed.
If the new rules fulfill their intent, mass executions to reduce the
backlog will presumably take place and the US will at last improve its
productivity in executions. At least, that's what Congress professes to
want.
In fact, they probably prefer to leave the courts to protect us from
such a spectacle. The next appeal will doubtless concern the
constitutionality of a legislative limit to appeals.
In the meantime, economics may eventually cut the number of death
penalty cases: Union, South Carolina, has had to increase property taxes
to prosecute Susan Smith. Other small jurisdictions have consciously
decided not to ask for the death penalty, to save the community from the
enormous costs of vengeance.

SMILE please, you're on candid camera -- and lordy, isn't it getting
more candid all the time. I don't know about you but I can scarcely
manage a fixed grin anytime someone produces a camcorder, the
increasingly ubiquitous widget of our times. The sight of a camera lens
tends to have me shouting ''make up!'', ''lights!'', not bearing myself
for a warts-and-all, spots-and-all, odd-socks-and-all slice of
home-grown cinema verite.
The mass-produced, relatively affordable camcorder has turned legions
of erstwhile couch potatoes into budding Cecil B. De Milles. Previously
content to watch videos they now want to direct their own, featuring
their press-ganged nearest and dearest. Unfortunately their pretentions
are circumscribed by their aesthetic and technical abilities and the
acting potential of the cast. Pay-as-you-film-type deals might make the
acquisition of a camcorder possible but the gadget doesn't come with any
guarantee that the end result will be even remotely watchable.
But there is something compelling about seeing yourself on screen and
the same curiosity which has us lurking around the security cameras in
department stores, glancing furtively at the TV on the ceiling, has the
nation in thrall with camcorders. The delight is definitely in playing
director, not watching the boring results. The vids tend to be a truly
terrifying melange of sprawling family sagas, depressing Kitchen-sink
realism and endless shower scenes, more voyeuristic and scary than the
famous Psycho one.
Up and down the country horrified spouses are sinking into their sofas
and praying their Axminsters will open and swallow them up as their
sozzled partners insist on showing the neighbours that scene where they
were caught coming out of the bathroom wearing only a towel, curlers, or
nothing more than their modesty which has just been well and truly
scuppered. Can you imagine the potential parents will have for
embarrassing their children in the future, when they whip out the family
vids to entertain the new boyfriend/girlfriend? It truly doesn't bear
thinking about. Families will be torn apart and siblings will sue one
another.
The sentiment behind capturing family occasions is poignant enough but
has no relationship whatsoever with reality, with past experience, with
the fact that most family get-togethers are destined to end in tantrums
and tears. Why document that? Taking the camcorder to mum and dad's
golden wedding anniversary celebrations is nothing more than a recipe
for a do-it-yourself Mike Leigh film, and who would want a starring role
in that?
Families who want to get the most out of their camcorders should dump
the documentary approach, hand out some scripts, and recruit some
appropriately Happy Family members from Central Casting. Children and
pets should be suitably bribed and neatly arranged. Afterwards it might
look stiff and strained but it's basically following the tried and
tested principle behind most snaps in the family albums of the past.
Because the legacy of the camcorder culture is not touching,
heart-warming scenes. The natural comparison is not to domestic dramas
but to disaster movies. Polaroids capture moments of family harmony,
fake or otherwise, but camcorders document breakdown and discord, the
impatience that follows initial jollity, the short-tempered outburst,
the turkey carcase, the torn paper hats.
While good photographs evoke the ''aah!'' response the archetypal
camcorder sequence evokes ''oh no!'' It has inspired shows like You've
Been Framed, going strong into its seventh series and receiving a
staggering 23,000 clips a year of the nation's blunders.
Perhaps one of the most damning indictments of the camcorder is that
it has revived this ''slipped on the banana skin'' school of humour,
getting people to laugh at other people's misfortunes. On holiday
recently I noticed one popular bar was packed out every night with
punters gathered round its TV monitor which showed a You've Been
Framed-style compilation tape.
Its entertainment value was derived from documenting accident after
accident; a middle-aged woman felled by a falling shelf, a balloonist
landing disastrously, a skier smashing into snow, a boy attempting to
head a football but crashing into a fence instead, a granddad pushing
two baby girls on a swing which promptly collapsed. One clip showed a
little boy standing at the edge of the swimming pool, kicked in the face
by another child, coming down a flume, sending him toppling into the
water.
The horribleness of that was compounded by the fact that the film
producer not only froze the frame when he fell, they also replayed it
time and time again, milking the ''inexplicable'' laughs the moment
produced. What I found particularly disgusting about it was that it only
showed him submerging, the film was cut before the moment when he
(presumably) emerged from the water, it wasn't interested in the point
where everything was OK again.
During the holiday the beaches were full of families who seemed more
concerned with catching the children having fun rather than actually
having fun with them, constantly interrupting their play to get them to
move left a bit or right a bit into the perfect lighting position. So
many fathers whose idea of quality time with the kids was simply
pointing the camcorder, the ultimate grown-up's toy, at them.
So much for the romance of the screen. Camcorders kill it dead. Little
did Gloria Swanson know, when she drawled that ''the movies just got
smaller'' in Sunset Boulevard just how small they would one day become.

NORCROS, the building materials and print and packaging group which

hardware subsidiary, CEGO, for #40m to Laird Group.
The company made profits of #4.9m on sales of #47m in the year to
March but Norcros is selling it to reduce debt and concentrate resources
on the ceramics business. The disposal and other smaller sales will
reduce debt by #53.7m.
Most of the other building material interests have gone, save Crittall
windows, where a sale is expected before long, and Norcros also intends
to sell its print and packaging activities. It will become a smaller
company, concentrated on ceramic tiles, where it has a strong market
position.

Wet Wet Wet are sitting pretty at the pinnacle of the music industry.
David Belcher looks behind the scenes at a man whose confrontational
style has helped lift the band to dizzy heights
MESSRS Pellow, Cunningham, Clark and Mitchell enter the summer in a
deluge of big numbers: Wet Wet Wet are hot, hot, hot. Added to the
mammoth 15 weeks they spent last year atop the British singles charts
with Love Is All Around, there's the Clydebank laddies' current
record-breaking run of six sell-out shows at Glasgow's SECC.
There, during the course of eight nights starting this Friday the Wets
will be playing to about 50,000 people, most of whom eagerly snapped up
their tickets when they first went on sale almost a year ago. On top of
that, the band's latest album, Picture This, went straight into the
charts at No. 1 in April, becoming the fourth No. 1 in their nine-year
recording career.
Wet Wet Wet: the four-man combo with the thrice-repeated name and the
long-standing ''mystery'' fifth member, guitarist and co-producer Graeme
Duffin, who has at last begun to make occasional appearances in official
photographic records of group activities.
Yet there's another shadowy figure in the Wet Wet Wet story . . . a
sixth Wet without whose backroom forcefulness the band's sustained
success might never have happened. Take a bow, Wets' manager Elliot
Davis, the Scottish upholder of a fairground barkers' tradition which
extends back to Elvis Presley's personal overseer, Tom Parker.
Elliot's combative, confrontational marketing style is predicated on
real or perceived slights against his boys. His hectoring manner and
controlling instincts haven't endeared Elliot Davis to many people in
the music industry -- particularly not to journalists -- but they have
done a fine job of boosting and protecting the Wets. This is underlined
by an examination of the roster of artists on Beat Runs Wild, the
sampler album whereupon Wet Wet Wet made its major-label debut with
Mercury in June 1986.
Aside from the Wets, only one group, Swing Out Sister, could still be
said to exist. So who is Elliot Davis? He is a driven South-sider who
spent a long time scuffling on the music business's outermost Glasgow
fringes, not being taken seriously by the self-appointed hiperati.
Elliot worked in record shops and ran weekly club-nights. He co-promoted
occasional shows. He became manager to one or two local bands, spending
his days on the phone hassling club-owners for gigs.
For a brief spell in the early eighties Elliot paraded alias Clark
Kent, plainly envisioning himself as a caped entrepreneurial crusader.
It was at this point that Elliot/Clark and I first crossed swords when I
described him in The Herald as having assumed the metaphorical charmed
megaphone of Alan Horne. (Horne having freshly left Glasgow for fame and
glory in London after the phenomenal success of his prolonged publicity
campaign for the Postcard label.)
Elliot phoned me, ostensibly to complain about the comparison, but
also to tell me about the bands under his managerial tutelage. Bands
like Moroccan Coco and the Floor, who failed to attain household status
even within their own households.
With the arrival of the Wets, my relationship with Elliot assumed the
rollercoaster-ride aspect dreadfully familiar to every Scottish music
scribe. Offer 100% approbation on a regular basis and you're OK.
Anything less and you'll be loudly decried as a no-mark, a doughball, a
dummy.
Our first fall-out came in 1986 when, as a researcher on a
long-forgotten BBC Scotland music programme, I wouldn't give Elliot an
advance look at my questions for Marti Pellow. Soon after, in the wake
of a Mayfest show at the Pavilion featuring local contenders including
the Wets, things worsened when my review decried Elliot, present at the
back of the stalls, for having loudly and pointedly talked through the
quiet bits in the performance by my favourites, the long-lost Shop
Assistants.
Our inadvertent rapprochement came years later one wintery evening
outside a branch of Victoria Wine in Glasgow's West End. I'd gone
inside, thus missing my wife being approached by a forlorn figure
bearing jump-leads and seeking the use of her car's battery to get his
own motor going.
So when Elliot and I came face to face under my wife's raised
car-bonnet, it was hard to say who was more shocked. Elliot seemed taken
aback that I was willing to play the Good Samaritan; I was surprised to
see Elliot driving about in a rusty, battered old Ford Escort rather
than his swanky fifties-vintage gold Yank-tank convertible sportster.
I shouldn't have been too surprised, though. Pragmatism and economy;
getting the job done and hanging appearances. These have long been
Elliot's watchwords. They were evident at the Wets' first major SECC
show in 1987. How so?
There had been a fiscal disagreement between Elliot and the SECC over
merchandising arrangements, with the SECC wanting to charge Elliot the
customary fee for selling T-shirts on their premises and Elliot not
wanting to pay. Elliot's solution that night was to organise his sales
team personally.
As the Wets' show reached its conclusion, there Elliot was, mobile
phone in hand, running up the SECC's central concourse and out to the
neutral retail-space provided by the Finnieston footbridge, flanked by
vendors toiling under the weight of Marti-memorabilia.
Elliot Davis: I salute you for having steered a bunch of everyday
Clydebank guys to the toppermost of the poppermost. For having grafted
tirelessly through bad times and good. For having pointed Marti and Co
in the direction of your record collection and hence Al Green, Van
Morrison, Squeeze and John Martyn.
If you and I have to fall out again, so be it. Who knows what it might
spur you onwards and upwards to.

ANN DONALD meets one of the gorilla-masked avengers using unusual
tactics to boost equality in the art world
HOW to be a Guerrilla Girl in five easy stages: 1. Start a campaign of
Sexless Saturdays -- refuse to fornicate until your partner reverts to
feminism. 2. Use guilt as a tool. 3. Be funny. 4. Fly by the seat of
your pantyhose. 5. Have a good time!
These are just a few recommendations from a New York-based band of
gorilla-masked, female avengers who for the past 10 years have attacked
the sacred cows of the art establishment with facts, fake fur, and fun
in an attempt to eradicate sexism and racism from the so-called bastion
of liberalism.
Formed back in 1985, Manhattanites first became aware of the Guerrilla
Girls when they woke one morning to find their downtown streets
plastered in black and white posters that asked uncomfortably direct
questions and fingered the guilty in no uncertain terms.
One poster reeled off a list of 52 successful male artists names --
including Julian Schnabel, Keith Harin and Roy Lichtenstein -- while
posing the question: ''What do these artists have in common?'' Answer:
''They allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than
10% women artists or none at all.''
The only clue to the identity of the ''culprits'' was printed in the
corner: The Guerrilla Girls. The Conscience of the Art World.
This was only the beginning. Future tactics included bus ads,
billboards, magazine spreads, pasting posters up in the toilets of the
Guggenheim and inventing bogus awards such as The Norman Mailer Award
For Sensitivity to Issues of Gender Equality.
Their agenda was obvious -- to expose individuals or institutions they
saw as under-representing or excluding women, or artists of colour,
coating their serious message in the powerful weapon of humour.
Ten years later and the GG are by no means a quirky New York
phenomenon. The smart-ass poster campaigns, the lecture tours and the
media coverage has ensured a truly international following. Their
concerns now embrace issues such as Aids, gay rights, rape, abortion and
homelessness, and their tongue-in-cheek art attack philosophy is even
permeating the ''derriere -- not avant garde -- world of art'', as they
quip gleefully. And still no-one really knows who these quasi-terrorist
reformers really are.
Not only is their anonymity preserved via the hairy gorilla masks
(avialable in albino and regular) but via the artistic pseudonym of a
dead female artist that each GG adopts. This explains why I am not in
fact communicating with the dead but conducting an interview with Frida
Kahlo who is apparently alive, well, and chatty in New York.
As Kahlo points out, the masks not only afford the GG protection from
any vengeful curator or critic whose name has adorned their ''hit
lists'', but serves a far more important job.
''The minute you knew who I was, you would start asking questions
about my own work and how being a GG has affected it,'' says Kahlo, who
like her colleagues Georgia O'Keefe, Diane Arbus and Anais Nin, are
rumoured to be well-known art world figures. ''Then you would start to
see the issue of sexism in the arts as an individual problem rather than
a social problem. And that would take away the power of a mass
movement.''
The movement that Kahlo refers to is the F-word, Feminism. When the
group formed in the mid-eighties the term had fallen into disrepute with
a media set on declaring feminists out-of-date and out-of-touch with the
rest of society.
The economic and political atmosphere of Reagan's America too had
filtered down to the art world. Despite female and artists of colour's
contribution to the experimental art of the seventies, the eighties
economic boom resulted, say the GG, in the exclusion of their work from
international galleries and museums in the name of investment. As Kahlo
explains: ''We thought all that (sexism and racism) was taken care of in
the seventies, but it reared its head again.
''We decided to make feminism fashionable again,'' smiles an unfazed
Kahlo. ''We wanted to break the stereotypes of feminists being dour and
uninteresting women. We wanted to show that it was the art world that
didn't have a sense of humour!''
Indeed, by employing a rapier-like wit and using mass-media
techniques, the GG tried to repackage the concept of feminism for the
nineties and communicate their message unhindered by manipulation,
direct to the public.
One successful campaign was the result of a ''weenie count'' at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York which compared the number of nude
males to females in artwork on display. The bright yellow poster
featured the idealised beauty of Ingres Odalisque, replete with gorilla
mask and asked the queston ''Do Women Have To Be Naked To Get Into The
Met?'' The answer is a resounding Yes. They reported in bold print that
less than 5% of artists in the modern art section were female while 85%
of the nudes were.
Though clearly not without detractors how successful have the GG been?
According to Kahlo the evidence is hanging on the gallery walls. ''There
are definitely more women being included in exhibitions now and
everybody (she stresses) counts.''
Whether this ''counting'' will change other critics' deep-seated views
regarding sexism and racism in the art world remains to be seen.
Meanwhile watch out for the guerrillas within our midst.
* The Guerrilla Girls will be at the CCA tomorrow at 7pm. Confessions
of the Guerrilla Girls is published by Pandora at #9.99.

I, TOO, have been following with interest the debate with regard to
the change in mortgage assistance from the DSS when someone becomes
unemployed (July 10).
Peter Ramsay's letter, while extolling the principle of self-provision
for mortgage cover should unemployment arise, betrays an ignorance of
the reality by postulating an entirely false premise, ie that claims
submitted will be admitted.
Thousands of home buyers who have willingly purchased mortgage
protection insurance have found that when making a claim for cover under
such policies they are met with a myriad of exclusion clauses which
often the seller neglected either to point out or explain.
All too often, the explanation follows with alacrity once the claim
hits the examiner's desk.
I highlight only one such very common clause -- ''no benefit will be
payable for unemployment which results from the termination of
employment subject to a fixed term contract''. I await with interest to
learn how that will fit in to the flexible working patterns which are
being increasingly adopted by employers.
It is essential that before the measures proposed for October 3, 1995,
are introduced steps are taken to ensure that, at the point of sale,
exclusion clauses are fully explained and that the seller is satisfied
that the policy suits the buyer's needs; that account is taken of the
growing practice by employers of using fixed term contracts of
employment; and that disability clauses -- especially existing
disabilities -- are overhauled.
Unlike your correspondent my opinions and objections are not tinged or
motivated by the politically expedient, rather by a deep anger that such
unfair and unreasonable practices should be allowed to continue in
tandem with draconian legislation to further disadvantage those of all
political persuasions and none, at the very time when the scourge of
unemployment finds them at their most vulnerable financially and
psychologically.

ABTRUST Scotland Investment Company had another excellent year,
growing three times faster than its benchmark index.
The Aberdeen-based investment trust, which mainly invests in unquoted
companies in North-east Scotland, made #2.5m from the takeover of three
firms in which it held shares.
But fund manager Hugh Little said the trust also owed its success to
the excellent performance of Aberdeen's offshore oil and gas industry
which acts as an economic dynamo for the whole region. Offshore-related
companies account for 30% of Abtrust Scotland's #31m portfolio.
Later this month the trust will get a new #6.5m cash injection, a
large slice of which will be invested in the management buyout of St
John Hospital in Aberdeen.
The new funds represent the second tranche of a #13m rights issue
agreed last year.
Abtrust Scotland's net asset value increased 12.7% to 46.3p per share
during the year to May 31, outpacing the Natwest Securities Ventures
Capital NAV Index, which rose only 3.9%.
But the dividend was only raised by 7% to 0.75p since the main aim of
the trust is capital rather than income growth. Earnings per share fell
to 0.80p from 0.85p.
Abtrust Scotland made a windfall profit of #2m in the first half of
last year by selling its shares in Scotcare nursing homes and Wm Low
supermarkets when they were taken over by Crestacare and Tesco
respectively.
The trust scooped up a further #500,000 in the second half with the
reverse takeover of Worth by the cable television company Devanha.
But many of Abtrust Scotland's core companies also performed well.
Mr Little said firms in the energy business such as the Ian Wood Group
and Atlantic Power &amp; Gas had thrived by diversifying away from the North
Sea into the Far East, the Gulf of Mexico and other overseas markets.
''The prospects for oil and gas service companies in the north-east
have never been brighter,'' he said. ''They have changed beyond
recognition and are no longer so dependent on the North Sea.''
Abtrust Scotland received a #240,000 boost at the start of the current
financial year when it received 135,000 new Grampian Television shares
in a three-for-one scrip issue in June.
The new shares were issued to compensate voting shareholders for the
enfranchisment of Grampian's non-voting investors.
Mr Little said Abtrust Scotland was now planning its largest ever
single investment -- #3.5m of equity to support the #6m management
buyout of St John Hospital in Aberdeen from the charitable Order of St
John.
The MBO beat three rival bids, including one by the private health
care group BUPA.
Mr Little said Abtrust Scotland was now looking at two or three other
large MBOs in Grampian region.
Recent new investments include North Anderson Cars, the largest car
dealership in North-east Scotland, Axial Group, a printing and media
company, and Macrae Holdings, a Peterhead-based fish and food processor.

THE Famous Grouse flies ever further abroad thanks to the
international distribution network of Remy Cointreau.
The key brand for Highland Distilleries saw sales rising by 12% in the
French cognac, champagne, liqueurs and wines group's year to March,
pointing to an overall global total of over one million cases.
Encouragingly in the latest three months, the momentum has continued
with the Remy firepower now being extended to Italy and to the
rapidly-growing Swedish market.
Already accounting for perhaps 60% of Highland's export sales, the
Remy connection has other nuances given that there are opportunities for
closer integration given that Highland has sufficient financial
resources to help support the debt-reduction programme which will be
unveiled over the next few months.
Through the 30% stake in the Orpar holding company, Highland has about
17% of the group, having spent #19.5m in maintaining its proportional
holding some months ago. The counterbalance is that Remy owns 10% of the
Glasgow-based distiller.
Even in these days, the Auld Alliance of the 15th and 16th centuries
does seem to carry some weight, difficult to measure, but helped by a
common policy of striving for quality.
Joint managing director Francois Heriard Dubreuil of the controlling
family said that debt reduction, gearing is around 100%, is the biggest
problem at present and that there are several options including selling
off the ownership rights of some brands.
That has already been accomplished through hiving off Picon to Grand
Metropolitan's IDV subsidiary at about eight times turnover -- the
converse is that brand owners, particularly at the quality end of the
market want Remy in the emerging markets to sell their product. It is
now distributing Finlandia vodka into Russia.
Heriard Dubreuil was speaking after Remy reported profits up 9.5% to
Ffr276m (#35.6m) but that was struck after the equivalent of #12m of
exchange losses due to following the advice of ''experts'' which
resulted in not hedging against the dollar for the financial year.
Operating profits were down 9.5% because of price competition.
Overall turnover rose 5% to Ffr6720m, helped largely by better wine
sales, particularly in China where the company has been a participant
since 1979.
Cognac showed little real growth although the Chinese market which
accounts for 40% of product sales was buoyant. Champagne went ahead and
with prices having been increased in June and relatively stable grape
prices, the outlook for the Heidsieck and Krug labels is highly positive
with sales up almost 36% in the June quarter with consumers trading up.
The Cointreau liqueur has had mixed fortunes with growth in the US
offset by dull trading in Europe. The marketing campaign to reduce the
age profile of the ideal comsumer has not yet succeeded to any extent.
However, the resumption of nuclear tests will be an adverse factor in
Australasia, certain to result in reduced sales of French products.
Like Highland, Remy has an aggressive approach to pricing and
introduced increases of between 4% and 10% in late June and these seem
to be holding despite the competition not yet stirring. There is some
concern that the major rivals which are effectively the UK-owned spirits
companies are too timid in taking a lead although some would argue that
is scarcely surprising given the management turmoil in two of the three
biggest operators.
The shares eased to Ffr154.40 by the close where they yield about 3.5%
on the Ffr4.60 net dividend -- an interesting stock for those seeking
substantial exposure to emerging consumer markets.

ELECTRICITY industry regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild probably
had little idea, yet again, what he was unleashing with his latest
pricing review.
Effectively, the new regime is so relatively mild, despite the
protestations of participants, that it is now open season for predators,
particularly from abroad escaping from harsher pricing regimes.
Already Lyonnaise des Eaux of France has said that it will bid for
Northumbrian Water if its get the Monopolies and Mergers clearance with
its report already given to the Trade Secretary -- the date for
submission was July 4.
There seems no good reason why a bid should be stopped on grounds of
competition and that an agreed offer will be made, probably in
September.
Ian Lang's clearance of Lyonnaise's move will undoubtedly generate
even greater interest.
Monday saw SBC Warburg scoop up 11.2% of the shares of South Western
Electricity in a market raid compared with the 15% they were seeking on
behalf of Southern Co, the largest of the US utilities.
Southern paid 900p a share to value the second smallest of the English
and Welsh regional distributors and called for talks.
In a welcome contrast to the reluctance of Northern Electricity to
talk to Trafalgar House, Sweb immediately agreed.
It had sufficient feelers that any offer, particularly if a third
party did not intervene, of 950p would be sufficient to sway the balance
in favour of the bidder.
Its profits performance has not been exciting and sentiment has been
clouded by various attempts at diversification which have produced
little real reward for shareholders which has generally been par for the
course for the utilities.
While Sweb does have various partnership projects on the blocks such
as participating in gas supply, the benefits are some time off. At the
same it has to grapple with the problems of high distribution costs in a
sparsely populated part of England, Cornwall and Devon, and where there
is little scope for much more cost-cutting beyond that already
announced, some 500 jobs to 2400, when set against static demand.
Indeed, it is somewhat intriguing as to why anyone would want to buy
Sweb other than a cash cow to provide a platform for launching projects
elsewhere in Britain and Europe.
There is a risk of name confusion as Southern Electricity, the Rec to
the right on the map, adjacent to Sweb, has said in the past that it
would not be an active bidder but would be prepared to act as a white
knight in a hostile bid situation.
The synergy benefits of putting together two Recs are probably greater
than for the US Southern Co although to add to the complication both are
involved in discussions with National Power and PowerGen as to whether
they will but excess generating capacity which the two major suppliers
have to sell off.
The talks between Southern Co and Sweb appear to have been somewhat to
the point with the prey saying that the proposed offer of 900p
ex-dividend would be strongly resisted by the board and also that it did
not want to have any further discussions under present circumstances.
But while the Sweb share price may have risen another 29p to 939p
yesterday, there is the thought the Southern Co may be prepared to add a
slight premium to gain accceptance to avoid a political row which would
be likely if the bid does become hostile.
However it seems highly probable that the list of both electricity and
water companies will be reduced in number by a fair proportion over the
next year -- and thoughts of a General Election may well speed up the
process to provide a perhaps slightly unexpected plank of support for
share prices.

I REFER to the statement made in the ''Who owns Scotland now?''
article as to the ''lack of a proper land register'' in Scotland (July
11).
Scotland has maintained a public record of conveyancing transactions
since 1617 through the Register of Sasines. Since 1981, a modern
map-based land registration system, the Land Register of Scotland, has
been introduced progressively across Scotland. Its operation currently
covers in excess of 40% of Scottish properties and it will, in time,
supersede the Register of Sasines.
The Registers of Scotland Executive Agency, which is responsible for
these and other registers, has a programme to extend the operation of
the Land Register to cover the whole of Scotland by 2003.
Finally, I would point out that the Land Register is a register of
interests in land and not a nationality register. The names of
proprietors of lands or properties are clear from either register, but a
declaration of nationality in respect of a land or property acquisition
is not a legal requirement.

I AM in no way opposed to the games gimmicks employed by certain
sections of the tabloid press. After all, since some papers in fact
present so little real news interest, indeed insult the intelligence of
their readers, it is the very least they can do.
At a time when the all-consuming greed of a minority threatens the
very structure of society and environment, all that some sections of the
tabloids can churn out are page upon page of rubbish about the sexual
inclinations of various unimportant public figures. It might be
understandable if they were reporting on something as important as the
notorious ''Profumo'' case where state security might be at risk.
The reason for my bile is that after coming out from an apparently
spotlessly clean post office where I had been filling in a form for
mailing, I discovered that the sleeves of my light-coloured jacket were
filthy, being covered by a mass of silvery scrapings.
I can only hope that this money-grubbing Government of ours have
ensured that the material which coats these billions of cards which are
swamping the country has been proved to be non-toxic. If not, I shudder
to think of the effect on crawling infants and household pets.

WILKOMMEN, bienvenu, welcome to Edinboro. You'll have had your
dijeuner, nein? Let no-one say there is anything personal between this
diary and tourists. Everybody has to be somewhere, as Woody Allen used
to say, but why do so many of them have to be here? And why is it that
the innocent populace is never consulted on the benefits or otherwise of
having your city overrun on an annual basis?
Festivals may be a case in point. Edinburgh, it seems to this Diary,
is now perilously close to being so thoroughly festivaled that natives
will begin to feel like extras in someone else's movie.
There's the international event, the fringe, the jazz festival, the
film festival, the folk festival, the book festival, the children's
festival, the science festival, the puppet and animation festival, and
(cue light showers and gusting winds) the tattoo. We look forward to the
Festival for Folk Who Can't Stick Festivals.
But this is, for once, a semi-serious Diary point. Summer in Edinburgh
has become close to intolerable. Traffic in the centre has been
''calmed'' to the point of grid-lock yet open-topped tour buses are
still crawling round the place purveying dubious historical nuggets.
Visitors have a great time; locals (few of whom see much of the economic
benefits said to justify the horrors) are condemned to misery with no
say in the matter.
Take tall ships (we speak of little else in these parts). According to
the people planning to bring lots of big boats to Leith sur Mer next
weekend, anything up to one million visitors could be arriving to gawp,
eat pieces, buy tall ships teddy bears, and, if they're that way
inclined, have their faces painted. Fair enough, and no doubt gratifying
to Edinburgh Tourist Board, which exists only to inflict such nightmares
on us.
But what of Lothian region, Edinburgh District Council, and Lothian
and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd, each of whom has chipped in to make the
event possible. What, other than the chance really to calm traffic by
closing down most of Leith, is their excuse?
Thus the Diary's nomination for self-regarding econo-babble of the
week comes in an advertisement by the enterprise company. ''Edinburgh's
Economy Welcomes the Tall Ships'', it says. Edinburgh's economy? Oh,
yes: those million visitors and their spending power will have ''a
direct benefit on local employment and business''.
Now there's a vision for the future: make the city uninhabitable and
solve unemployment by sticking some ships in the port. Lothian region is
meanwhile claiming that the tall ships event is the latest in a series
which ''bring significant economic benefit to the region''.
Maybe so. But here, as in so much of Scotland, it is being achieved at
the expense of the very quality of life that makes the capital so
attractive to visitors in the first place. Is it just us, or is there a
hole in that logic somewhere? This has been a Diary diatribe.
Day at the races
ANOTHER visitor in these parts of late, of course, has been none other
than Her Majesty the Mrs Queen Windsor, who paid a visit to Musselburgh
at the start of the month to carry out her fundamental constitutional
duty of going to the races.
Strictly speaking, she came to open a new hospitality stand at the
racecourse, but she did also witness one of her nags placing second to
last in the aptly-named -- if you've ever seen the councillors in action
-- East Lothian District Council Handicap. This, according to
constitutional experts, was the first time in almost 50 years that the
sov had been to a track in Scotland.
Nevertheless, someone did manage to recall that she had visited
Musselburgh in 1956 and 1958. Thus, in honour of her return, an
exhibition of press cuttings and pictures was mounted, including
coverage of a visit she made to Loretto school.
There, one learns, she was much impressed by a 16-year-old's
demonstration of book-binding. The boy wonder? One Norman Lamont, no
less.
In those days, it seems, he could even make the books balance.
School of
hard knocks
ONE OF the most splendid of traditional Edinburgh sights is, of
course, that of the middle classes closing ranks, a ceremony performed
with near-military precision at the slightest hint of criticism. This
they have been doing in fine style in the face of claims that not
everything at Fettes College is as it might be.
Now, it is not for the likes of us -- scruff to the core and long
beyond saving -- to comment on the rights and wrongs of the controversy
(something to do with drugs, discipline, and the usual bizarre toffs'
rituals) but we do note a tendency among the school's defenders to
behave as though anything costing ten grand a year must of necessity be
beyond reproach.
Still, that's not what interests this Diary. What we want to know is
this: were other distinguished former Fettesians ever ''initiated'' in
crude and unwholesome ways? Did, say, a Mr Tony Blair thus learn how to
break the armlocks of surly trade union oiks at the old school? And
what's the Shadow Cabinet's position on broom handles?
Shining examples
THREE sure signs of heat-wave-style, what-a-scorcher conditions: one,
even the beggars in the Royal Mile have daubed themselves in fetching
fluorescent sunblock; two, tables are placed on the pavement for al
fresco diners -- outside the chip shop; three, the heavens commence to
open.
Solemn
proclamation
NEVER let it be said that Edinburgh District Council is not on the
ball. In keeping with the dignity of the place, the City Chambers sports
a beautifully printed announcement on its elegant notice board. ''Notice
of Meetings'', it says. ''July, 1995. No meetings''.
Missing link
FINALLY, we are grateful to the Berwickshire News and East Lothian
Herald, which states that the recently opened WRVS ''Child Contact''
centre in Galashiels ''is available for absent parents to spend time
with their children''. We presume the absent parents first have to turn
up.

WITH reference to the Rev Evie Young's reply to my recent letter
regarding selection for the ministry, may I please ask for enlightenment
on a few points?
I can't help feeling that the selection system is a bit short-sighted
and vague. Evie Young mentions the need for ''other gifts in addition to
a sense of call, a sincere faith, and dedication''. What are those other
gifts? What more can be asked of candidates?
Why not let them into the secret of the attributes required for the
job, let them know which Ps and Qs should be brushed up, where they are
making mistakes, how they can improve themselves. Encouragement, not
discouragement, should be the watchword.
I also wonder why the committee recommends that ''applicants do not
begin to study in divinity until they know they have been accepted by
the Church for the ministry''. Surely this puts the cart before the
horse. How many people are fortunate enough to be given a job, then
begin studying to achieve it? Not many. People usually study for their
chosen career, then apply when they have gained sufficient
qualifications. Why should the Church be any different?
Evie Young assures us that ''it is made quite clear to applicants . .
. who will be interviewing them and whether these Church assessors are
ministers or members of the Church who serve in a different role''.
Perhaps so at selection panel interviews, but no-one with the audacity
to appeal against the third and final rejection is made privy to the
identities of the appeal panel members. No-one introduces himself and
tries to put the appellant at ease. Their distinctly frosty attitude
seems designed to undermine his confidence.
The supporter/friend who the candidate has been allowed to invite to
accompany him is warned before the court is in session that he must not
speak. He is allowed to say nothing at all in support of the one who at
that moment needs his help most. Who says the cutty stool has gone?
The main thrust of my criticism is that unsuccessful candidates are
never, at any of their interviews, told where they have gone wrong. What
a blow to their self-confidence, their self-esteem!
There can't be many applicants for the ministry who use it as a
vehicle for some other profession. Surely their motives are all beyond
reproach, so a rejection must be like a death blow.
If they were advised that they lacked intelligence, did not speak
clearly enough, had no empathy with their fellow man, even wore the
wrong colour of shirt, they could remedy this and improve themselves
enough to make a better impression at their next interview. They could
learn by their mistakes.
However, the Church does not seem to thrive on encouragement. it
appears that once assessors reach the giddy heights of 121 George Street
they lose touch with reality.

PETER RAMSAY must surely give evidence for his bold assertion that ''a
large council house building programme would result in greater public
expenditure and no change to the number of unemployed'' (July 10).
In a report last month Shelter Scotland set out a programme of housing
investment which would provide around 13,200 affordable homes for each
of the next five years. In addition, we envisage substantially increased
resources being committed to the twin blights of disrepair and dampness.
Such a programme would require an additional #580m of capital
expenditure each year: crudely about a 60% increase in the Scottish
Office housing budget or around 2.5% in the total budget responsibility
of the new Secretary of State.
Just under half of this could be found from the savings of #250m which
are being made from reducing the poorly-targeted homeowners' subsidy,
MIRAS. This saving could pay eight times over for the cost of income
support for mortgage interest in Scotland, to which Mr Ramsay seems so
opposed.
Far from having no impact on unemployment, the additional housing
investment of #580m would help to sustain an additional 33,000 jobs,
just over half directly in construction. The savings to the Exchequer on
reducing social security payments and increased tax yields would be just
under #300m per year.
In contrast, Government policy of reducing all access routes to
housing other than home ownership is in conflict with the stated policy
of labour market flexibility which in turn is supposed to reduce the
dole queues.
With more part-time work and short-term contracts, sustaining mortgage
payments will become increasingly problematic. Flexibility will be
undermined unless public policy reduces its dependence on rigid housing
prescriptions.
Building and renovating low-cost homes for rent makes economic as well
as social sense.

IT appears that the politicians are at last taking notice of the
growing feeling against the abhorrent disease of ageism which has been
allowed to flourish, unfettered by legal restraint, for the last few
years.
The Conservative MP, Anne Widdecombe, recently gave an interview on
BBC Radio stating her opposition to ageist employers and their methods
of staff selection and recruitment. Unfortunately, her Government is not
in favour of legislation to cure the disease. It will only support
voluntary codes of practice which proved to be so ineffective in the US
and other countries worldwide.
However, the Labour Party has at last grasped this particular nettle
and announced a Bill of Rights which contains reference to anti-ageism
legislation. It has advised me via Tony Blair and Ian McCartney, MP,
that it intends to pass legislation making it illegal for employers to
discriminate on the grounds of age. It has a group of experts meeting at
present to discuss the shape of future proposed legislation.
I have been advised by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP that they are
against all forms of ageism and presumably they will support the Labour
legislation as and when it comes to pass.
It appears that the wishes of the millions of people who currently
suffer from age discrimination in employment are to be granted if Labour
are voted in at the next General Election, thus ending years of denial
of human rights which is so prevalent to the employment market created
by the privileged few for their own benefit.
Let us hope that we are at the dawn of a new and enlightened era in
industrial relations. Perhaps the Tory Government will see the sense and
give us the legislation before the next election. Somehow I doubt it!

SUPPORTERS claim Michael Forsyth has returned to the Scottish Office a
more pragmatic, sympathetic, and understanding politician. If so, why
has he appointed a completely unknown, untested, and -- by far the worst
-- unelected individual to his team of ministers?
The Earl of Lindsay? Who is he? What right does this ''young Old
Etonian'' (that ubiquitous, but still patronising, description) possess,
that I or another five million people in Scotland do not, to guide
agricultural, forestry and environmental policy in this country of ours?
Will the Earl of Lindsay last as long as that other shining example of
Scottish aristocratic political ability, Lord Strathclyde? Indeed, has
Michael Forsyth chosen a naive and unwitting earl as an easy stalking
horse, and ultimately sacrifice, should he make another significant
botched policy recommendation -- a la poll tax?
If the selection of a Scottish ministerial team is Forsyth's first
example of responding to the real needs and feelings of the Scottish
populace, I dread the future.

Home to a festival of surprises, Mull has never heard anything quite
like the Russian violinist who rattled roofs and reached into souls,
says Conrad Wilson
MENDELSSOHN on Mull, 10 busy, exhilarating days of music-making in
Tobermory and sundry cliff-top castles, had its origins in Leonard
Friedman's vision of a small-scale but broad-minded festival mingling
professional and student performers in concerts inspired by
Mendelssohn's historic visit to the island.
The programmes naturally range wider than the Hebrides overture, the
one Mendelssohn work directly connected with these tremendous seascapes,
unfortunately too big in its orchestral demands to be included in a
festival based primarily on chamber music. (It was played one year in a
chamber version.) But songs and string quartets, the D minor Piano Trio
and the great string Octet have all been heard in conjunction with
well-chosen works by other composers, old and new, Scottish as well as
German. Mendelssohn's spirit of adventure, and his love for
domestically-scaled music, have been splendidly honoured. The festival,
filled with surprises, has been a growing success.
But a year ago, Friedman suddenly died. The 1994 programme, most of it
already complete, took place under the artistic aegis of Angus Ramsay, a
colleague, friend, fine violinist and fellow pupil of Max Rostal, who
could be trusted to provide exactly the right continuity. This year's
festival, which ended on Sunday, was the first to be created by Ramsay
from scratch, and the first to feature a star name. Mordkovitch on Mull
could have been its subtitle, for the Russian violinist, Lydia
Mordkovitch, rivalled Mendelssohn as one of the personalities round whom
the event whirled.
But any fear that so passionate and powerful a presence might disrupt
the balance of a festival which, up to now, has shunned any form of
display proved groundless. Mordkovitch, while bringing a certain
exoticism to the Tobermory waterfront as she made her way to the Aros
Hall for rehearsals, master classes, and concerts, fitted in very well.
The students she coached in Mozart's G minor String Quintet, clearly
appreciated her vibrantly heart-warming advice. And in her equally
vibrant recital of Brahms, Rachmaninov, and Cesar Franck, the quality of
her tone seemed to embrace the audience, as someone remarked, in a great
Russian bear hug of sound.
This was music-making of the highest order and on the most generous
scale, given in a hall so small that its walls seemed under threat when
she was in full flight. Mordkovitch is not someone who brings
half-measures to what she plays. She sways, bounces, and bobs to the
rhythm. Her bow flails with passion (once, in London, she sent it flying
over her shoulder, leaving a dumbfounded pianist to finish the
performance alone). The incredibly rich, dark tone of the G string
sounds like the chest-notes of a great Verdi mezzo-soprano.
Yet not everything was presented at molten temperature. When the
occasion demanded, she would draw out a closing note with her bow
seeming barely to touch the string, the sound stretching into infinity.
Nothing seemed pre-conceived. Her choice of programme, announced
verbally during the recital itself, gave the evening a wonderfully
spontaneous sense of unpredictability. First came an isolated Brahms
Scherzo, a fierce flexing of the muscles, the notes hurled at her young
pianist, Julian Milford, who had sufficient sang-froid to catch them as
they came at him and hurl them back.
Brahms's A major Violin Sonata, the most serenely pastoral of his
three works in the form, was presented as the broadest of landscapes,
its sunshine nevertheless shot through with sudden whirlwinds and
thunderclaps. Rachmaninov's Vocalise became a highly-charged elegy, and
every note of Cesar Franck's Sonata dripped with emotion. This was a
recital of such amplitude that a whole series of encores were needed to
complete it. Vaughan Williams's Greensleeves -- its middle section
treated as a vivacious, pungent Russian dance -- was perhaps the most
striking, but a whimsical little fragment of Stravinsky and a
high-definition account of Elgar's Salut d'Amour ran it close.
Mull's facilities for music -- village halls, castle drawing rooms --
remove performances from formal surroundings and place them in settings
that enhance their effect. Performers and audiences interact. This
year's ''classical ceilidh'', in essence a moving yet by no means solemn
wake for Leonard Friedman, included new works he had commissioned just
before his death, mixed with older music that suited the context,
performed by old Friedman friends and by young players of whom he would
have approved.
A new sonata for violin and piano by David Dorward -- a single
movement sprouting from a few hesitant notes and building up to a
pummelling climax before expanding its groping introduction into a
full-blown elegy -- was the evening's highlight. Most of the music,
apparently, was composed before its dedicatee's death -- the elegiac
element was fortuitous, written to suit Friedman's own expressive
playing. Ginny Strawson, with Michael Haslam as pianist, performed it to
admiration. Friedman's as well as Dorward's personality shone through
the music.
Another elegy, based on the slow, gentle interplay of solo violin and
viola tone, came from Francesca Greene, in tribute both to Friedman and
to a shared affection for a poem by Yeats. This was touchingly played by
Angus Ramsay and Michael Beeston, but not everything about the concert
was so sad. A quintet for flute and strings by Dick Lee, with Anne Evans
as flautist, was bright, brittle and somewhat Gallic, and the first
movement of Mendelssohn's Octet -- a Friedman favourite in which he
himself took part more than once on Mull -- brought the evening to a
fizzing close.
But this was by no means a wholly retrospective festival. An
exhibition of Mull colourists in the dramatic surroundings of Glengorm
Castle, on the brink of the Atlantic, marked the start of a promising
artistic development, presided over by Norah Campbell and Val Leckie.
And in Sunday's closing concert, a Mozart programme featuring what Angus
Ramsay has christened the Festival Ensemble, there was the presentation
of what is to be known as the Leonard Friedman Violin Award -- a brand
new instrument, worth #7000, fashioned by a young Bavarian violin maker,
Fridolin Rusch, who has been working at the Baliscate Craft Centre
outside Tobermory.
Henceforward, the most deserving of the festival's young
instrumentalists will have the use of it for a year. Its first custodian
is to be Fiona Winning, an 18-year-old Scottish product of St Mary's
Music School in Edinburgh, where one of her coaches was Friedman
himself. She will be heard playing it during next year's instalment of
Mendelssohn on Mull.

I MUST disagree with Robbie Dinwoodie (Prepare for battle of the
slogans, July 7), when he states in relation to the extra tax Scots will
have to pay to set up and run a Scottish parliament ''not a tax as such
but a power, which may or may not be used''.
I believe it is extremely unlikely that English and Welsh MPs at
Westminster will sanction the continuance of the very generous Scottish
Office budget which we currently enjoy following the establishment of a
Scottish parliament.
It is inevitable, therefore, that Scots will have to pay extra tax
just for the pleasure of living and working in Scotland, the tartan tax.
I wonder just how long Scots would be willing to put up with such a
state of affairs?
The Labour Party and its supporters in the Scottish Lib Dems and
others have never thought through the economic and constitutional
dangers of such a parliament in Edinburgh.
The tax question and the West Lothian question have never been
answered -- and never will.
I very much hope that the new Secretary of State, Michael Forsyth,
will hammer home to every Scot just how much worse off each will be
under a Labour Government and a tartan tax.

THE letters you published on July 8 from two disappointed visitors to
Helensburgh, Kilcreggan and Cove will, it is to be hoped, make the
locals blush with shame. They certainly should, as the criticism is not
exaggerated.
Alas, I am not confident it will make those who cause the litter and
defile the shores, and Loch Long, any more mindful of the heritage we in
this area enjoy and share with visitors.
There are many waste bins for disposal of rubbish, but too often these
are overfilled and are not cleared as they should by Dumbarton District
Council despite the council charge being one of the highest in Scotland.
The foreshores are indeed unspeakably filthy. It is readily conceded
that much of the filth is washed ashore from the flotsam and jetsam, but
unless it is regularly cleared it must increase and prove not only
unsightly but a hazard to environmental health.
A contributory factor is unquestionably the proliferation of take-away
facilities and the thoughtless dropping of wrappings. It would surely be
helpful for vendors to encourage their patrons to be more aware of the
existence of waste bins. There are also bottle and can banks and
recently installed bins for discarded newspapers and magazines.

World-famous couturier Hubert de Givenchy will retire this week after
seducing the fashion world for decades with his stylish, elegant
creations. With British designer John Galliano set to take over,
Francesca Fearon looks back on a career which has influenced a new
generation of designers.
SIX months of rumour and speculation came to a dramatic conclusion
yesterday when, hours after Hubert de Givenchy's final collection was
shown, the owners of his Paris haute couture house made the dramatic
statement that the young British designer John Galliano is to assume the
role of creative director for couture there.
Yesterday morning the couturier who dressed Audrey Hepburn in films
like Sabrino, Charade and Breakfast at Tiffany's, took his final bow in
a collection dedicated to his faithful staff.
Hubert de Givenchy is retiring after 43 years of dressing some of the
world's most beautiful women including Jackie Kennedy, Jean Seeburg,
Grace Kelly, and the Duchess of Kent. Tall, still very handsome at 68,
and always dressed in his couturier's white coat, he is perceived as one
of the great gentlemen couturiers.
Galliano is a bold if eccentric choice as successor for Givenchy's
owners, LVMH -- Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (also owners of Lacroix and
Dior). He has taken the fashion world by storm since moving to Paris,
showing exceptionally creative collections that are rooted in couture.
Galliano's supreme skill is with bias-cutting, a talent well
demonstrated in the red Spanish dress Elizabeth Hurley wore at the Bafta
Awards. Givenchy's swan song, however, revealed the huge task Galliano
has been set. Exquisitely feminine glove-fit tailoring in velvet and
wool and sublimely elegant evening dresses set the standards Galliano
must follow.
Givenchy opened his house in 1953 but really made his name with the
sixties Geometric look -- slim, sharp tailoring so poignantly modelled
by Hepburn, this was the modern look currently inspiring designers like
Versace, Prada and Tom Ford at Gucci. Givenchy has become a designer in
the classic mode, balancing line and volume with comfort.
Balenciaga, his idol and later friend, taught him that fashion must
permit the personality of the woman to emerge first. There is quiet
style about his work, but it is a style that has never failed to seduce.
As one generation leaves the stage, a younger one is mastering the
leading roles. La Croix and Versace spurn the critics who constantly
sound the death knell of couture. No-one is hoodwinking anyone. Even
Givenchy has gone on the record saying: ''I'm against the notion that
courture will disappear. Couture collections should be smaller, and
ready-to-wear developed. People say couture is used to sell perfumes.
Well, that's not a bad thing.''
He believes it is the couturier's responsibility to find new clients.
A view expressed and upheld by La Croix and Versace, the most recent
couture recruits. But these two have chosen different routes. Versace's
all-white and vinyl Modernist collection, which opened this season of
shows last Saturday, appeals strongly to a celebrity clientele seated
around the catwalk. The sharp white-zippered line that revived memories
of the French singer Francoise Hardy appealed to Madonna (who modelled
his current advertising campaign), Meg Ryan, Jamie Leigh Curtis, and
Julie Delpy sitting in the audience.
La Croix, meanwhile, has drawn an elegant European following. He has
managed to succeed the vintage spring 1995 courture collection with one
for autumn that is as memorable for its calmness and extraordinarily
deft handling of his atelier's skill.
Spanish is still his favourite theme, but he has cooled his previous
enthusiasm for embellishment, retaining some of the jet-black embroidery
and laces to add a little spice to his subtly shaded colour palette. The
fluttering Velasquez fan billowed the folds of a bronze and copper
chiffon dress, which was cinched in place by a jewelled belt, is but one
example.
Masters of their art, La Croix and Versace entered the couture
spectrum from radically different points. Versace realises he caught
controversy with his vision of couture, but sees his art based on cut
and structure, which an all-white collection served to emphasise. He
took a modernist approach using a number of fabrics in white, from
cashmere to satin and nylon, adding the sparkling diamante and silver,
and metallic laminates sprayed with mother of pearl glaze.
Perhaps the most successful couturier of the moment, though, is
Valentino with an unprecedented 80 skilled workers in his atelier. Fresh
from creating more than 60 suits and evening gowns as well as a wedding
dress (rumoured to have cost #150,000) for the Prince Pavlos-Marie
Chantal Miller's wedding, he produced a collection based on the delicate
hues of orchids -- a pretty alternative to the usual muted dark tones of
autumn.
However, with a global clientele, he, like Versace, realises that it
is not winter everywhere. Concorde has made the difference. So the
tropical pinks and pastel hues of his silk and chiffon sarongs look as
mouth-watering in Papeete as they do in Paris.

LANGLEY, Virgina: A US intelligence agency yesterday released a first
batch of decoded diplomatic messages from the 1940s that laid bare a
Soviet effort to steal the secrets of the atom bomb and led to the
capture of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
At a ceremony at CIA headquarters to salute some of the cryptologists
who painstakingly cracked the Soviet code nearly 50 years ago, the
National Security Agency made public translations of 49 messages from
the 1940s. It plans to release more than 2200 such messages starting in

FRENCH President Jacques Chirac was booed and heckled in the European
Parliament today when he arrived to report to Euro-MPs on last month's
Cannes EU summit.
In unprecedented scenes of hostility for the head of an EU member
state, Mr Chirac was met in the debating chamber by placards and banners
denouncing his decision to resume nuclear tests in the Pacific.
The president affected to ignore the protests, pausing only to say
that the eight tests planned before May next year would enable France to
sign a global test ban treaty. ''I noticed a certain emotion on this
point, which I understand, although I do not share it,'' Mr Chirac said
dismissively.
Socialist, communist and Green Euro-MPs yelled ''No, No, No'' and
waved banners and posters showing mushroom clouds as Mr Chirac began his
speech.
A German Green, Friedrich Wolf, denounced Mr Chirac as a
''neo-Gaullist Rambo.'' An Irish Green, Patricia McKenna, said: ''It is
clear from these protests that most EU countries reject the arrogant
French colonialism which he represents.''
Some members raised a banner behind Mr Chirac saying, in French and
German: ''Stop nuclear tests now.'' Another banner said: ''Monsieur
President -- non.'' Other members hung a banner from a gallery with the
message: ''Less arrogance in the Pacific, more courage in Bosnia.''
Security guards tore down the banner, provoking protests as the
president of the parliament, Mr Klaus Hansch, repeatedly shouted at
members to lessen the noise. He also threatened to suspend the session.
Some of the toughest criticism came from British Labour Euro-MP Mrs
Pauline Green, who also leads the 221-strong socialist group in the
parliament. Mr Chirac sat a few feet away from Mrs Green as she
condemned the French government's seizure of the Rainbow Warrior 2.
''My group would consider it great hypocrisy were I not to make clear
our strongest protest and our solidarity with the people of the Pacific
who feel their environment and human rights are about to be violated,''
Mrs Green said.
She added: ''At a time when the international community is in the
process of re-negotiating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty you, Mr
President, personally took the totally incomprehensible decision to
resume testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific.''
She challenged Mr Chirac to explain what strategic results were served
by the proposed nuclear tests.
Some right-wing Euro-MPs, including former Belgian premier Wilfried
Martens, complained that the behaviour of some Euro-MPs in the chamber
lowered the credibility of the parliament.
But a section of Mr Chirac's speech went down with British Tory
Euro-MPs. The French president -- looking to next year's sensitive
Maastricht review -- appeared to confirm reports that he has struck up a
good working relationship with Prime Minister John Major.
He said he wondered if Europeans ''should not look more across the
Channel'' to the United Kingdom. ''I think in Europe no-one pretends to
the view that you can build Europe without the United Kingdom,'' he
said.
Riot police used force today against Greenpeace protesters who
disrupted the start of a Franco-German summit with air raid sirens to
protest against France's decision to resume nuclear testing, Reuter
reports.
The demonstrators parked a cattle truck tethered to a barrage balloon
flying the banner ''Stop nuclear testing'' about 200 yards from the
square where President Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl arrived.
Several of the protesters were chained to the vehicle with bicycle
locks. Police tried to force one of the locks over the head of one
demonstrator, causing him to howl in pain.
''Their brutality is really amazing,'' said the demonstrator, who gave
his name as Markus.
Half a dozen riot policemen picked each up demonstrator and carried
them away, tearing a Greenpeace T-shirt off one young woman.
Meanwhile, Greenpeace taunted French authorities today to step up the
hunt for three activists it said were still at large near France's
nuclear test site at Mururoa Atoll.
French officials challenged the claim that three Greenpeace protesters
on a small inflatable dinghy had so far evaded capture and were hiding
near the test site.
But Greenpeace spokeswoman Stephanie Mills denied the environmental
group was bluffing about the presence of the trio, led by veteran
protester David McTaggart.
''The inflatable is definitely out there. The French military have
told us that they're looking for it,'' said Mills from aboard the
Greenpeace flagship.

More than a newspaper is at stake as the Scotsman is put up for sale.
Former editor Magnus Linklater suggests that it must be cherished as a
great Scottish institution
THE day that Roy Thomson arrived in Edinburgh to buy the Scotsman, he
bought a sixpenny ticket for the No. 14 tram and set out on his own to
do a tour of the city. He trundled down Leith Walk to Newhaven and
Granton, then back via the North Bridge out to the South Side, peering
through his big, thick spectacles from the top deck, chatting
occasionally to the conductor. He wanted to get a feel for the place
that he intended to live in if his bid was successful. By the time he
got back he felt better prepared for the hard bargaining that lay ahead.
That was August 18, 1953, Coronation year. And since then the Scotsman
has been in Thomson hands, building from a circulation of less than
50,000 that year, mainly in Edinburgh and the Lothians, to its last
recorded figure in 1994 of 82,000, throughout Scotland. Since history
now seems like repeating itself, with the Scotsman on the market and
nervous journalists wondering where the bidders are going to come from,
it is worth looking back at that takeover which changed the face of the
Scottish press. There are important lessons to be learned from it.
The first is that, then, as now, there was no doubting that the future
of a great Scottish institution was at stake. To see it passing out of
Scottish hands was tantamount to a national trauma.
The fact that it was facing bankruptcy under the Findlay family which
had owned it for generations, and that no-one could find ''a
philanthropically-minded Scotsman'' willing to put up #1m to save it,
did not alter the reluctance with which the board embarked on a search
for new ownership. Sir Edmund Findlay, the last Scottish proprietor,
finally accepted that the paper would have to be put on the market but
made one proviso: it must not be sold to an Englishman.
Instead it went to a Canadian who had the merit of being very rich and
passionately excited about newspapers.
Looking back, it is the excitement Thomson felt about owning the
Scotsman that strikes one most forcibly. Here was a man who loved
newspapers, respected their role, and encouraged their independence.
Profits, bottom lines, all the commercial jargon of the modern newspaper
organisation came lower down the list.
That did not mean that financial viability was irrelevant, and the
second lesson is that, rich as a prospective buyer may be, the
determining factor will always be the price. Thomson bargained for hours
until he got within #25,000 of what he believed the paper was worth to
him. He offered to toss a coin for the difference, to which the canny
response was: ''If you can afford to toss for it, you can afford to
pay.'' Nevertheless, he got a bargain. By selling parts of the building,
he believed he had bought a national newspaper for less than #400,000.
Things are different this time around. The first is that the Thomson
Organisation is not selling a loss-making paper. The last published
profit figure was #9m, and though that may have been something of a
peak, it suggests that Thomsons are in a strong position to ask for a
premium price. Figures of up to #200m have been mentioned for the
Scotsman and the Press and Journal groups. Even if the Scotsman group is
separated off, an asking price of #120m is likely to be in Thomsons'
minds, though I understand that the Toronto management feel the
important objective is to find the right proprietor rather than merely
the right price.
At the same time, Scottish papers all round are facing a tough time,
with price-cutting rivals, energetic London-based newspapers expanding
northwards, and newsprint costs rising the whole time. Not surprisingly,
any prospective buyer will be looking not just at the latest financial
results but the rocky road ahead.
So, can the clock be put back and a Scottish purchaser found to take
the paper back into native hands? I am pretty certain that the money is
there. There is no lack of well-heeled financial institutions available
in Scotland to fund the right kind of investment. But newspapers need
more than companies looking for a quick return. They need commitment,
dedication, and above all an understanding of the way newspapers need to
be nurtured over the long-term if they are to prosper. If the price is
too high, it may be that a consortium stretched for funds would find
itself fighting budgetary battles the whole time rather than
concentrating on the important task of representing Scottish interests.
An alternative purchaser would be one of the multi-national media
organisations which currently control the majority of newspapers in
Britain and indeed throughout the world. Their names are familiar. They
would not blink at the price, and they might have strong reasons for
including such a prestigious title in their portfolio.
But whether the paper itself would benefit from becoming just another
cog in a large machine is questionable.
What is needed more than that is a clear understanding of why the
paper is there in the first place and what its role must be. Within the
next two years Scotland may have its own Parliament, a reform the
Scotsman has been pursuing for more than 100 years. If and when it
comes, the nation will need a paper with its independence and political
experience to report and analyse that momentous event.
Scotland is enormously lucky to have two papers like The Herald and
the Scotsman covering the Scottish scene. They are both intelligent and
thoughtful publications which take their roles seriously. They get into
trouble from time to time with Scottish Office ministers, they tread on
the odd toe, they make mistakes.
But they are an essential part of the national identity, and without
one or the other, the country would be a lesser place. The competition
they provide for each other is part of their strength. Oddly enough, if
the Scotsman went out of business, it would damage The Herald rather
than ensure its survival. Newspapers are like that.
The hope must be, therefore, that a new owner is found who can combine
something of the idealism that Roy Thomson brought to his first and most
cherished British newspaper, together with the hard-headed management
that a modern newspaper needs.
And let me remind anyone out there with a few bawbees jingling in
their pockets, that the rewards are more than just pecuniary. Before he
bought the Scotsman, Thomson had a conversation with Sir Linton Andrews,
the bluff proprietor of another newspaper the Yorkshire Post. Thomsom
asked him how much he wanted for the paper, and was told at least ''#5
million''.
''That's an awful price for a small return,'' said Thomson.
''Yes,'' replied Sir Linton, ''but if you bought the Post there's
every likelihood you'd die a peer.''
Worth thinking about.
* Magnus Linklater, broadcaster and commentator, was editor of the
Scotsman from 1988 to 1994.

AN ACTOR'S nightmare must be that his Hamlet is outshone by someone
else's Horatio, his Macbeth upstaged by the chap playing Malcolm.
Similarly, Mr Major was taking a bit of a chance -- if not forced to it
by stern necessity, as some report -- in naming as his deputy Mr Michael
Heseltine.
Mrs Thatcher was not taking much of a risk appointing Sir Geoffrey
Howe, although, offered the leading role on one unforgettable occasion,
he became a star for a day
But Hezza? He may be an ageing Titan but still a Titan, and when he
strode into the Chamber behind Mr Major, Labour added some ironic cheers
to the volume created by the Tories who were taking the easy way to
demonstrate that unity had lasted a week.
''Questions to the Prime Minister'' intoned Madam Speaker Boothroyd.
''Which one?'', yelled Labour, but it was the grey one who got up and
did the business.
Even though they deride him as a ham and a ''has been,'' Labour cannot
wait to see Heseltine tread the boards again in his new coat of many
colours. Rumours that half the Cabinet are already cheesed off by his
suggestions of how they could do their jobs better suggest plenty of
opportunities for Labour to twist the lion's tail.
These are pleasures, possibly, to come and may be more enjoyable in
anticipation as may be the dreams of those Labour Scots of making hay
with Mr Michael Forsyth. They did not find it easy to do when he was a
mere Under-Secretary and Minister of State. He may, possibly, have
mellowed. He is unlikely to be less formidable. Ditto Hezza.
As it was, Labour had the less comfortable Question Time, which was
cheering for Government supporters, whose team have looked a certainty
for relegation almost since they won the last championship.
Sir Michael Neubert (Romford -- Con.) informed the Prime Minister
that, if Mr Blair is being coy about the level at which Labour would
introduce a mimimum wage, his Employment spokeswoman Ms Harriet Harman
had assumed in her remarks in the previous day's debate that it would be
between #3 and #3.50 an hour.
Ms Harman made violent negative signs with face and hands. Mr Blair
smiled determinedly. Really, said Mr Major, Mr Blair had been
''dithering'' on this. Mr Major likes to portray Mr Blair as indecisive.
Mr Blair then got his own back and accused Mr Major of failing to act
with authority and tell his MPs to vote for the Nolan recommendations on
purifying Parliamentary life.
As the key recommendation would have MPs disclose to the world what
they earned from consultancy work and as this might astonish some
constituents and embarrass some MPs, authority would certainly be the
word. Mr Major disingenuously replied that the Privileges Committee was
still mulling over its report and he would do it the courtesy of waiting
for it. The committee is not so much mulling as deadlocked.
Mr Blair pursued to little purpose the odd idea that a Government is
bound to accept the recommendations of committees it sets up. If he is
shocked by the reaction to Nolan, he will need the smelling salts for
Scott.
Mr Jim Dowd (Lewisham West -- Lab) turned the spotlight back on Hezza.
He congratulated Mr Major on retaining his position in a Government now
being run by Mr Heseltine, asked what exactly the great man was going to
do and, quite pertinently, why, after five years as a solo Prime
Minister, Mr Major had decided he needed a deputy. That one went
unanswered.
Mr Major said Mr Heseltine would be ''supporting me across the full
range of Government policies,'' which sounded pretty good. He would have
''direct control'' of competitiveness and deregulation, which sounded
less impressive, although it's probably enough for Mr Heseltine to make
a nuisance of himself to his Cabinet colleagues which is what Labour is
devoutly hoping he will do.
Someone on the PM's briefing team had worked out that Labour would
have a go at the Heseltine appointment and had prepared a reasonably
good joke. Mr Heseltine, said Mr Major, had a reputation for straight
talking as did the deputy leader of the Labour Party, Mr John Prescott.
''Both have a reputation for robustly attacking the Labour leader and I
expect that to continue.'' (Reasonably unforced Tory laughter.) Mr Blair
and Mr Prescott chuckled too.
One really feared more for the Government's future when dripping wet
Euro-fanatic Mr Hugh Dykes (Harrow East -- Con.), still over the moon
about the return to influence of the Tory left, demanded that
''provocative and silly historical marches'' should be banned.
Most of Ulster's Unionist MPs were out marching, but Mr John D Taylor
(Strangford -- UU) rose wrathfully to his feet. The Speaker,
Westminster's equivalent to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, managed not
to call him. Mr Dykes' question was another Mr Major thought best to
leave unanswered.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has directly intervened on the
future of the Fort William sleeper and the West Highland line in moves
which could set the scene for a U-turn on the future of rail services
north of the Border.
Mr Forsyth, who has been in his post for less than a week, has made a
direct approach to the new Transport Secretary, Sir George Young, under
his ''let's talk'' philosophy, and is hoping for an early one-to-one
meeting which, it is understood, will take place.
In addition, he is planning to call in Passenger Rail Franchise
director Roger Salmon for talks on the plans for the service. Mr Forsyth
is understood to take the view that if the sleeper goes, there is a
threat to the whole West Highland line.
His attitude was described by one source yesterday as: ''Ian Lang
tried with Brian Mawhinney (the previous Transport Secretary), I want to
try with Sir George Young.''
Mr Forsyth's intervention coincided with a Commons debate on rail
privatisation, initiated by the Liberal Democrats, which took place
against the background of reports that ScotRail's privatisation --
thought to be on the ''fast track'' -- might be delayed.
Public consultation on the future provision of lines in Scotland also
is due to end today.
Delay in privatisation was denied by Government Ministers, but
Labour's Transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, claimed that the whole
privatisation timetable was in disarray and that taxpayers' money was
being squandered on a ''futile exercise.''
He told the House: ''The crucial issue is that this Government is
tearing the heart out of the railways.
''We have seen for the past 18 months on issue after issue that not
only is this Government not achieving any of its privatisation
objectives but is destroying much of the morale and the network that has
been built up over the last 30 to 40 years.''
He described the West Coast main line as ''a tragedy unfolding'' and
angrily claimed that the announcement of an #18m update of the
signalling system was a ''substitute for a #1 bn project which is
disappearing into the mists of time.''
On the sleeper issue, he said utter contempt had been shown for the
people of Scotland by those who thought they could close services under
the guise of the Passenger Service Requirement. He described the whole
situation as a ''fiasco.''
From the Liberal Democrat benches, Mr Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty
and Skye) warned the Government that its privatisation programme for
rail services in Scotland already was off the rails.
He said: ''Michael Forsyth is right to seize the opportunity for a
change of policy as one of the first things he does as Secretary of
State.
''He might stand more chance of success with Sir George Young than his
predecessor did with Brian Mawhinney. It seems that Sir George might be
more accommodating over Scottish rail campaign issues.
''I call on them both, with the close of the PSR consultation, to
recognise both the quantity and the quality of the campaign's
submissions. They should act immediately to lift the threat to existing
services.''
For the SNP, Perth and Kinross MP Roseanna Cunningham issued a
statement in which she said that action from the Scottish Office was
better late than never.
However, she added: ''As well as discussing the future of the West
Highland sleeper service, Michael Forsyth should also be working to
reinstate the vital Motorail services. The two go hand-in-hand and are
of vital importance for the viability of the tourist industry.
''Anything less would be totally inadequate and an indication that all
Forsyth is interested in is buying some cheap headlines, rather than
addressing the serious problems caused by rail cuts in Scotland.''
The Government's official line was that privatisation offered the best
opportunity for ''reversing the historic decline suffered by the railway
system under nationalisation.''
The Liberal Democrats' motion was heavily defeated by 262 votes to 49,
a Government majority of 213.

ANY chance of the Labour Party avoiding a damaging row at its October
conference over the introduction of a national minimum wage disappeared
yesterday.
Just a day after Labour leader Tony Blair had urged them not to seek
to tie an incoming Labour Government to a figure or formula, delegates
to the Transport and General Workers' Union conference in Blackpool did
just that.
With just one vote against, delegates reaffirmed that the union, the
largest party affilliate, remained firmly committed to a national
minimum based initially on two-thirds of male median earnings, or #4.15
an hour.
The most effective argument for doing so came from a #3.50-an-hour
cleaner from Brighton, Ms Penny Iveson, who said that there was a need
to move on from #4.15 to #6 a hour as soon as possible as only then
would the low-paid be released from the poverty trap.
''Tony Blair should not be allowed to duck and weave and tell us it's
none of our business. If low pay is not union business, what is?'' she
said.
Other delegates urged Mr Blair to stop ''fudging'' the issue of a
statutory minimum wage.
General secretary Bill Morris accused Labour leaders of making policy
by opinion polls rather than conviction.
He compared the approach of current Labour leaders with that of the
late John Smith, who had stated that if a Government was not prepared to
work for poverty pay it should not condemn others to do so.
''People who argue against #4 should get back to the grassroots and
talk to those people who are struggling to survive,'' he said.
Mr Morris sought to defuse the simmering row with the Labour
leadership by emphasising that the #4.15 an hour rate was not a demand
being made to any political party but to employers.
In the Commons yesterday, the Prime Minister denounced Labour plans
for a national minimum wage as ''economic nonsense'' and ''politically
expedient''
The Prime Minister challenged Mr Blair, sitting on the Front Bench:
''I would prefer to have an answer to what a minimum wage is going to be
than to see him smile.''
He added: ''The Labour leader has said 'econometric models indicate a
potential jobs impact'. What he means is that there will be job losses
from a minimum wage.

MRS Winnie Ewing, Britain's longest-serving Euro-MP, yesterday
celebrated her 20th anniversary in Europe by accusing the UK of a ''big
brother'' approach to Scotland.
As she arrived at the main entrance of the Strasbourg assembly, she
was met by dozens of constituents and party workers who had travelled
from as far as Orkney for a celebration dinner
As Mrs Ewing, the SNP president, was giving television interviews, one
of her supporters was cheered when he raised the Saltire on a spare
flagpole outside the parliament beside the flags of the 15 EU-member
states. The pole had been reserved for Norway, whose voters rejected
membership last year.
After being feted by the president of the European Parliament, Mr
Klaus Hansch, and before joining other Euro-MPs as guest of honour for
dinner, Mrs Ewing compared the Irish experience in the EU with
Scotland's.
''Scotland, as part of the UK, loses out in Europe. Other small
nations in Europe do very well,'' she said.
''Ireland is an example of a small state which is very Euro-minded and
derives every type of economic benefit from the EU. Scotland, however,
is represented in Europe by a Westminster Government which was not voted
for by the people of Scotland and whose outlook on Europe is peripheral
and defensive,'' she said.
Mrs Ewing, Euro-MP for Highlands and Islands, said the ''big brother''
approach of the UK Government did Scotland no favours. Scotland's
fishermen had lost out because the London Government had refused to
match EU funding of various aid schemes. When steel reductions were
ordered by the European Commission, it was conceded that no member state
should be asked to destroy its steel industry.
''But the UK Government closed down the Scottish steel industry. Any
Scottish government of any colour would have fought to stop these
absurdities from happening.
''Scotland as a member state in her own right could fight to protect
Scottish interests. It is the UK Government Ministers in the Council of
Ministers and at home who have destroyed sectors of Scotland's industry
and deprived others of benefits they were entitled to -- not the
European Union,'' she said.
Mrs Ewing predicted: ''I think that in the end we will see a future
with Scotland a member state of the EU and England looking in from the
outside.''

Kirsty Scott explains why, after 50 years of silent shame, a few of
the ''comfort women'' enslaved by the Japanese military are now
demanding compensation
I am so miserable; return my youth to me; apologise and give me
compensation. You dragged us off against our will, you trod on us. This
lament, can you hear it my mother and father? My own people will avenge
my sorrows.
YI YONGSU was just 16 when the Japanese stranger stuffed a bundle
containing a red dress and smart leather shoes into her arms.
Poverty-stricken and uneducated, she was transfixed by her new finery
and followed the man when he beckoned her. That journey was to take her
from her rural home in Korea to an army barracks in Taiwan where she
spent years in sexual slavery as a ''comfort woman'' for Japanese
soldiers. She lost her virginity in a brutal rape and was tortured with
electric shocks to break her spirit.
Yi Yongsu is one of an estimated 200,000 mostly Korean women who were
forced into prostitution by the Japanese military between the 1930s and
1940s. Like the others, she kept her secret until a couple of years ago
when investigations into the outrage and calls for compensation started
to grow. Like the others, she had all chance of a normal life destroyed
by her experiences. Few married, many were shunned by their families,
many more committed suicide.
How could I dream of marriage? Until recently I had suffered from
venereal disease . . . I felt a little sad that I would die without ever
having had the opportunity to wear a white veil. So, at the age of 60, I
married a 75-year-old man. That was in January 1989. I chose an old man
because I basically dislike men. But he was jealous of me and he abused
me so much that the marriage failed.
Yi Yongsu's story and the stories of 18 other comfort women have now
been collected and translated by British academic Dr Keith Howard, of
the London School of Oriental and African Studies, to bring details of
their plight to the West.
It was only in December of 1991 that three former comfort women went
public and demanded 20 million yen in compensation from Japan for their
suffering. The UN has stepped in, appointing a rapporteur to investigate
sexual slavery, and last year the influential International Commission
of Jurists said Japan had legal and moral obligations to compensate the
women.
In 1993 the Japanese Government did admit, for the first time, that
women had been forced to work as sex slaves for the military during the
war, but they have so far dodged the issue of compensation.
They admitted that the comfort stations were set up on the front lines
with the initial aim of preventing soldiers from contracting venereal
disease from uncontrolled prostitution. The first was set up in Shanghai
in 1932 and the practice continued until the end of the war.
It has been described as military industrial rape, and one former
soldier has come forward to admit that he enslaved at least 1000 women,
often raiding villages and towns and dragging women away. Korea was a
Japanese colony at the time and many Koreans were also involved in
procuring women.
''Japan has acknowledged that it happened,'' said Dr Howard. ''They
have implicitly acknowledged that the military was involved but they
have not accepted that the Government should take any responsibility.''
In the stations the women lived in rudimentary accommodation where
they were required to service as many as 30 or 40 men a day. The
soldiers were issued with tickets which were then collected from the
women at the end of the day. Many of the women were barely in their
teens. They were regularly checked for disease and given condoms which
had to be washed, but many contracted venereal disease.
The soldiers would queue up outside each door waiting for their turn .
. . I was made to serve about 10 men when it was quiet and 40 or 50 on a
Saturday and Sunday . . . there were many times when I was almost
killed. If I refused to do what one man asked, he would come back drunk
and threaten me with his sword. Others arrived simply drunk and had
intercourse with their swords stuck in the tatami (mattress).
Dr Howard says the structure of Korean society, coupled with the
women's shame, kept the atrocity buried for almost half a century, until
a fledgling women's movement in South Korea, and the fact that the
surviving victims were now old, allowed the first to come forward.
''In traditional Korean society if you were used for sex you were a
prostitute,'' he said. ''It is only now that they are old that they have
nothing to fear, and their families are secure that they can come out
and say things, but it's still difficult to get people to abandon 50
years of hiding their identity.''
Dr Howard said the experience and the brutish realities of their lives
afterwards have left a generation of women with horrific mental scars.
''There was an appalling psychological effect. Korea is a very
strongly Confucian society where chastity is everything. Going through
forced prostitution is the death of you, and I'm quite sure a lot of
women killed themselves because of that. Their bodies were ruined and
many could not have children. They were physically destroyed by their
experiences, then they suffered again by having to keep silent.''
Dr Howard is confident that the women will eventually win out and
force Japan to make reparation, and he hopes that the initial stories
will persuade other comfort women to go public and seek justice.
''Japan is at the stage where it wants to make an impact on the
world,'' he said. ''Japan does fear the international arena and we are
moving into the international arena. It is not impossible to suppose
that they will change if the UN comes out and says something very
strongly about the comfort women issue.''

happened even after I die.

HIGH living certainly seems to suit the ptarmigan. Perhaps that is why
Avonside Homes has named the most expensive property it has ever built
in honour of the mountain grouse that stalks Scotland's high peaks and
corries.
The four-bedroom Ptarmigan is one of five new housestyles which is
being introduced at the company's Westward Rise development, off
Moorfoot Road in the North Baljaffray area of Bearsden.
At a selling price off #202,250, the Ptarmigan has a split-level
design to take advantage of the views surrounding its hillside location.
The property features four spacious bedrooms, a lounge with a large
balcony to the front elevation, a family room, dining room, utility room
and cloakroom.
The interior of the new showhome is the work of designer Alexis Leech,
who says: ''We have flown material in from the United States and
commissioned other fabric from London's Royal College of Art to achieve
the right look for this prestigious new home.
''The Ptarmigan has many interesting architectural features, such as
the large bay window area in the master bedroom, and we have made the
most of these in our designs. I am delighted with the finished result
and hope that our work gives the viewers of the showhome ideas of how to
maximise on its unique design aspects.''
Avonside's managing director Bob Gillespie says: ''The new showhouse
will give potential purchasers a superb illustration of our
architectural flexibility which allows us to adapt our designs to suit
the surrounding environment, as well as catering to individual tastes.''
When complete the estate will consist of 39 split-level three and
four-bedroom detached homes, ranging in price from #165,500 to #205,500.
All of the properties have double garages, pavioured driveways, and
turfed front gardens as standard.

<HEADLINE>Leaders clash on Nolan report</HEADLINE>

LABOUR leader Tony Blair challenged the Prime Minister yesterday to
press ahead with the Nolan committee's key recommendation that MPs
should disclose earnings from outside consultancies.
However, at Commons Question Time, Mr Major refused to be drawn on his
views until the special select committee set up to decide on how to
implement Nolan's proposals had reported in full on the issue.
In terse exchanges over possible curbs on MPs' outside interests,
which have been bitterly opposed by Tory back benchers, the Prime
Minister accused Mr Blair of using the Nolan report on standards in
public life as a ''political football''.
He denounced the Opposition's tactics as ''pretty transparent and
pretty shabby'' and denied delaying ploys were being used by pointing
out that the select committee examining the report had met 14 times in
14 days.
The select committee on standards in public life split along party
lines on Monday, with Tory MPs and a lone Liberal Democrat combining to
block Labour demands for the early implementation of new curbs on MPs'
outside consultancy work.
The committee instead recommended further work on the issue ''as a
matter of urgency'' with a fresh report, if possible, before the new
session of Parliament starts in the autumn. MPs are expected to vote on
the committee's report before the Commons rises for the summer recess
next week.
Mr Blair tackled the subject in the Commons, demanding: ''Do you agree
in principle that MPs should disclose their earnings from outside
consultancies?''
Mr Major said: ''I think you know a select committee is examining
that. They have reported and I will do the select committee the courtesy
of awaiting their report.''

SRI Lanka's President Chandrika Kumaratunga ordered the military today
to investigate reports the air force bombed a packed Roman Catholic
church in the northern Jaffna peninsula, killing 65 people.
An International Committee of the Red Cross official said 13 babies
were among the dead found under the rubble of St Peter's Church in
Navali, north of Jaffna town. It said 150 people were wounded.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, the target of a
major government offensive launched on Sunday, said the air force
dropped nine bombs on a church packed with people fleeing the war.
The presidential secretariat said Kumaratunga had instructed the army
to check the reports.
In a letter to Kumaratunga sent through the ICRC, Bishop of Jaffna
Thomas Savundaranayagam said the air force bombed refugees sheltering in
the church, killing more than 65 civilians. More than 150 were seriously
injured.
''Many hundreds were rendered homeless as many houses were razed to
the ground and others heavily damaged, including our church and the
priest's house,'' it said.
''Therefore, we very earnestly appeal to Your Excellency to kindly
instruct your forces to desist from bombing, strafing and
artillery-rocket attacks on civilian targets like churches, schools and
hospitals.''
The military had denied any knowledge of the bombing, but today
military spokesman Sarath Munasinghe confirmed the church had been hit.
He said it was not clear whether the damage was done by the armed forces
or the LTTE.
A Red Cross statement said the bombing killed 65 men, women and
children. ICRC field co-ordinator Dominique Henry told Reuters 13 babies
were among the dead.
The military had dropped leaflets warning civilians to seek refuge in
temples and churches to minimise the chance of death or injury in air
strikes.
Rebel radio said the bombing took the casualty toll to 150 civilians
killed and hundreds wounded in the Operation Leap Forward offensive
against the LTTE. It said 400,000 people had fled their homes.
Two Sri Lankan army battle groups resumed their advance in the Jaffna
peninsula today and had captured more territory, Munasinghe said.
He said the LTTE had suffered heavy casualties, but gave no figures.
Seven soldiers had been killed and 36 wounded, bringing the armed
forces' death toll since Sunday to 14, he said.--Reuter.

DESPITE increased public unrest, heads of privatised electricity, gas
and water companies yesterday were accused of continuing to receive
several millions of pounds in share option schemes and bonuses while
service offered by them to the public fell.
The utility chiefs were warned that under a future Labour government
such perks would be unacceptable.
Latest figures showed that top management in the privatised utility
companies had received more than #100m in bonuses and share schemes
while service to the public had fallen dramatically, Labour's Consumer
Affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths told a conference in London.
The two-day seminar is being attended by leading figures in the
utility industries.
They were told by Mr Griffiths that figures, based on City closing
prices on Friday, underlined the fact that the heads of the utility
companies were awarding themselves even larger sums than those perceived
by an already disillusioned public.
Mr Griffiths, MP for Edinburgh South, indicated that under a Labour
Government the heads of those companies could expect little mercy.
He called for an immediate freeze on share option schemes for those in
power in the utility companies.
''Labour will set tough targets for service improvements and establish
consumer watchdog committees to protect the public,'' Mr Griffiths
pledged.
He added: ''Labour will open up the utilities to public hearings on
prices, service standards, and profits before price decisions are
made.''

<HEADLINE>Bridge charges take their toll on Skye</HEADLINE>

In two months motorists travelling to Skye will be using the new #25m
bridge, and, as Elizabeth Buie discovers, residents are angry at having
to pay dearly for the privilege
THE people of Skye believe that when the new bridge opens in September
they will be paying the highest road bridge tolls in Europe, if not the
world.
While the tolls have yet to be confirmed -- they will be linked to the
retail price index -- they are likely to mirror the charges made by the
ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, soon to cease its operation.
The Skye Bridge Company's bridge manager, Russell Thomson, who moved
to his current job from CalMac, says the provisional charges will be as
follows: #5.20 for a single car journey in high season, #4.30 in low;
#12.62 for freight vehicles, up to and including three-axled vehicles,
and #25.20 for the second group of more than four-axled vehicles;
service buses #14.80; and touring coaches #37.20 in high season and
#25.20 in low season.
Foot passengers, who currently cross free of charge by ferry, will be
charged 55p for a single journey -- by bus.
But local people's anger is directed at the fact that they have not
been involved in fare negotiations, despite a recommendation from a
Scottish Office public inquiry Reporter that they should be.
''We are a very fragile, rural economy trying to exist and this has
been imposed on the community -- it is not something we want,'' said
Councillor John Farquhar Munro, chairman of Skye and Lochalsh District
Council.
He said that the economies of Skye and Lochalsh and the Western Isles,
which will also be served by the #25m bridge, would be hardest hit not
by the car-crossing fares, but commercial vehicle charges.
''With the ferry at present, the coach operators are able to negotiate
terms. But we cannot with the bridge,'' he said. Their hope lies with a
group of local people who have formed the Skye Boat Company and hope to
buy a ferry from CalMac. They would then undercut the bridge's charges.
Councillor Munro is also concerned that CalMac's current system of
operating a credit and invoicing system will not be perpetuated by the
bridge operators. The district council, for example, a regular user,
would have to find #350 in cash every morning to give its drivers for
bridge charges if an alternative system was not found.
Mr Thomson: ''There is no denying the fact that as toll bridges go
this is expensive. However, the decision was taken five or six years ago
that if a bridge were to be provided it could only be done through
private funding. The debate on that is over. It has always been
stipulated that the money invested by various bodies, including the Bank
of America, would be recouped by tolls and these would be linked to the
June 1991 ferry fares.''
Mr Thomson said that the bridge operators hoped to have recouped their
investment within the next 18 to 20 years.
Councillor Munro, however, predicts a growing clamour among islanders
to have the tolls reduced, particularly for regular users.
''The Severn is not as expensive as Skye -- and the people there have
an alternative. If you come to bridges like the Forth or the Tay or the
Erskine, you can go another way, and you pay a nominal toll of 50p or
60p,'' he said.
Tom Hart, chairman of the Scottish Transport Studies Group and
vice-president of the Scottish Association for Public Transport, accepts
that the Skye Bridge is a special case. The bridge provides an island
link, there are very few alternatives, and the Government was not
prepared to subsidise the bridge, so the company had to peg its tolls to
ferry charges.
Hart said: ''The argument on bridge tolls is beginning to be replaced
by the general argument on whether all major roads should have tolls.
But the Government has got very nervous. The nearer the possibility of
actually imposing them, the bigger the practical problem.''
Nevertheless, the Government's recent announcement that it was looking
at the deregulation of some private and local authority river crossings
is a sign of the times, he said. He is convinced that the Government
wants to reduce its capital expenditure on roads by increasingly relying
on private finance for road building. For their part, the private
companies will rely on direct or shadow tolls.
The problem, of course, is that if new roads are tolled, drivers will
stick to the older routes, causing more congestion and damaging the
environment.

BURMESE dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, appearing in public today for the
first time after six years in detention, said she was confident
democracy would prevail in her troubled Southeast Asia country.
Less than 24 hours after being freed from house arrest by Burma's
military rulers, Suu Kyi said she was willing to talk to them about
achieving peace and stability in the country.
''I am happy to be able to say that despite all that we have
undergone, the forces for democracy in Burma remain strong and
dedicated,'' a beaming Suu Kyi told reporters.
''I do know that democracy will come to Burma because it is something
that the people want,'' said the 50-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner,
adding she never doubted she would be freed.
As she spoke to a large gathering of reporters in the lakeside home to
which she had been confined since July 20, 1989, a delighted crowd
gathered on the street outside, even though a local media blackout of
news of her release was still in force.
Suu Kyi said top officials from the ruling State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC) told her yesterday that she was
unconditionally freed.
''They would like me to help towards achieving peace and stability in
the country,'' Suu Kyi said.
''We have to choose between dialogue or utter devastation. I would
like to believe that human instinct for survival alone, if nothing else,
would eventually lead us to prefer dialogue.''
Suu Kyi also said she had no bad feelings towards those who imprisoned
her, and said some of them were even ''charming'', but pleaded to
military authorities for moderation.
She appealed to the government to release other pro-democracy
campaigners still in prison.
Suu Kyi was detained by the SLORC after outspoken attacks on the
military which killed and imprisoned thousands while surpressing a
pro-democracy uprising in 1988.
She said she thought her release should be seen as a positive sign,
but cautioned against expecting too much too soon.
Her next priority would be to sit down with fellow pro-democracy
leaders and decide on their next steps.
Immediately after her release, and again this morning, Suu Kyi met
senior officials of the National League for Democracy (NLD) she helped
found in 1988.
The NLD swept elections in 1990, taking 392 of the 485 contested seats
-- even though Suu Kyi was already detained at the time. The SLORC never
recognised the election result.
Suu Kyi said the results showed the true feelings of the Burmese.
''The majority of the people in Burma believe in the market economy and
democracy as was amply viewed by the results of the 1990 election,'' she
said.--Reuter.

A golden opportunity to stimulate the housing market is being missed
by the Government, says the National Association of Estate Agents
(NAEA).
The recent White Paper on housing aims to encourage people to buy
their homes from Housing Associations, rather than directing them
towards the stock of houses already for sale in the private residential
market,
While broadly welcoming the White Paper, called Our Future Homes:
Opportunity, Choice, Responsibility, Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief
executive of the NAEA, says: ''We had been looking for more positive
steps to encourage buyers back into the market place. With houses more
affordable than at any time since the Fifties, and with historically low
interest rates, now is one of the best buying opportunities for many
years.
''Unfortunately, people do not appear to be recognising this. As a
result, the White Paper's lack of short-term positive measures to lift
the present market is very disappointing.''
Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy says the Government should have boosted confidence
by reinstating MIRAS to its former 25% on the first #30,000 of a
mortgage, or at least giving a long-term commitment to freezing MIRAS at
its present rate. It should also have given additional help to
first-time buyers by recommending short-term tax benefits over a period
of, say, the first five years in their new home.
He describes the proposal that money raised from the sale of housing
association properties should be ring-fenced for re-investment in the
construction of new properties to replace those which had been sold as
''illogical''.
He asks: ''What is the point of selling homes and then replacing them
with new ones? This would take potential buyers away from existing
properties on the market.
He adds: ''On the rental side, we welcome the commitment to increase
the rental sector and to make it easier for potential landlords to rent
out their property.
''Increasing home ownership by another 1.5 million over the next 10
years is a praiseworthy objective. Unfortunately, this will be done by
increasing right-to-buy schemes, whereas the Government should be
diverting these people into the existing housing market.''

<RECORDNO>977436889</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS Fraud Office director George Staple yesterday was forced to
make a series of damaging admissions over its handling of the
controversial Levitt fraud case.
During intense questioning from MPs, he conceded that the SFO had a
''slight credibility problem'' following its failure to secure
convictions in a number of high-profile cases.
Mr Staple had been summoned back before the Treasury and Civil Service
Select Committee after admitting evidence he gave to the committee last
month regarding the 1993 Levitt case had been inaccurate.
There was an outcry when investment adviser Roger Levitt received a
180-hour community service order as a result of a plea bargain struck
with SFO lawyers after he was originally alleged to have misappropriated
#59m.
Mr Staple expressed ''regret'' that, when he gave evidence last month,
he had ''failed to remember'' a crucial meeting with the prosecuting
lawyers, headed by David Cocks QC, shortly before the case opened.
At that meeting Mr Staple told the lawyers he was ''minded'' to accept
a deal with the Levitt side. He had previously insisted there had been
no plea bargaining in the run-up to the case.
He strongly denied, however, that he had intended to mislead the MPs
or that a Commons written answer by Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell
about the case, which he helped to prepare, had been misleading.

ORGANISERS of this week's Scottish Open Golf Championship were
bunkered by a catering firm yesterday.
The family business won its case when a row over fast food, outside
the championship course at Carnoustie, was decided in court.
Matters came to a head on Monday night when Angus District Council
towed away catering units, hired by fun fair operator Mr George O'Brien
to coincide with the golf championship which tees off today.
The caravans were then dumped on the street and council officials
claimed, at the time, that the O'Brien family had ''no permission'' to
have the vehicles on the site.
Yesterday. Mr O'Brien went to court to prevent the Scottish Open Golf
Championship Ltd from obstructing his access to an area, near the
championship course, to sell ice cream, hot foods, and other items.
An interim interdict had been granted by Sheriff Kenneth Forbes on
Monday and yesterday at Arbroath Sheriff Court the sheriff continued the
order.
Mr Wilson McMichael, solicitor for Mr O'Brien, explained that the
O'Brien family had carried out business in Carnoustie for 30 years.
The court was told that, over the past seven years, Mr O'Brien had
been given permission, in letters from Angus District Council, for the
''exclusive right'' to sell ice cream and other items on an area of the
Links in the Angus town.
The fun fair operator leased a 1900 square-metre site to operate his
rides and, this year, he had hired six mobile catering units at a cost
of #3000 each.
However, Mr McMichael added that the council had granted the catering
rights to the Scottish Open Golf Championship Ltd for the tournament.
The solicitor said that, last week, the council had lost a court move to
try to move Mr O'Brien's catering units.
The court was told that Mr O'Brien then received a letter from the
council ''purporting to recall permission''.
Mr McMichael added: ''The council appears to have quite simply
forgotten about Mr O'Brien and the right it conferred on him.''
Mr Harris Muir, for the golf tournament organisers, told the court:
''We feel that Mr O'Brien should not be there,'' and added he was not
one of the licensed caterers inside the ground.
He called the affair ''a bit of a muddle'' and added that the golf
tournament organisers had the right to use the area, where the catering
units were situated, for car parking.
Outside the court, Mr Robert O'Brien, Mr George O'Brien's son,
declined to comment.
Neither Mr Patrick Regan, chief executive of Angus District Council,
nor Mr Charles Perring, director of the Scottish Open, were available
for comment.

Would-be house sellers should not be put off by doom-laden media
comment surrounding the property market.
According to estate agent Iain Robb of the Robb Agency, the gloom has
been overdone.
''In reality, the market is still active where properties are
realistically priced. Informed home owners realise that any slight
reduction in the value of their property can usually be covered through
negotiating down the price of the home they are moving to,'' he says.
As members of the PHH Relocation Centre Network, The Robb Agency has
benefited from access to company relocatees whose moves are job related,
often with assisted finance from their employers.
There has been a marked rise in the number of job related relocations
around the country since the start of 1995.
PHH Homequity, the world's largest relocation company, report that its
company moves rose sharply earlier this year. Hywell Luke, director of
PHH Network says: ''We are now regularly moving people in numbers we
have not seen in over three and a half years. This is a clear indication
of the underlying level of business confidence and is well spread across
the country.''
Iain Robb says: ''Anyone considering a move should not be put off. We
have buyers eager to view realistically priced homes and such
properties, placed with a professional estate agent with access to a
wide marketing base will sell, even if the doomsday correspondents try
to tell us otherwise.
''Furthermore, relocating families are probably the best kind of buyer
a vendor could wish for. They are often cash purchasers, keen to move
quickly and are not normally constrained by a housing chain, as their
own sale is being looked after by their company.''

<HEADLINE>Court told of sex attack in a children's home.   Boy, 14, raped me, claims girl</HEADLINE>

A 14-YEAR-old girl resident of a Highland children's home told a court
she had been raped by another 14-year-old resident in her bedroom.
The girl also alleged at the High Court in Inverness that the accused
had been drinking, and that staff at the home failed to hear her cries
for help. She said that later she ''wanted to die''.
The accused, who cannot be named for legal reasons, caused a public
outcry in March when he was taken into custody, because he had to be
held in Porterfield Prison, Inverness.
The authorities could not find a suitable secure place for him to
remain pending his trial. Eventually he was placed in an establishment
in Angus.
The boy denies rape and a breach of the peace at the children's home.
The trial, before Lord Prosser, heard the girl claim that the accused
and another boy had come into her room late on the night of March 22 and
hid under the bed and in a wardrobe.
She said staff came in and searched her room but failed to find the
boys at the first attempt. But a few moments later, they were located
and put out.
However, the girl told Advocate-depute Bill Totten that the accused
returned to her room, refused her appeals for him to get out and then
pushed her on to the bed.
After refusing several times to talk about the alleged incident, the
girl eventually said she had been raped by the accused and then forced
to commit a sex act with him.
She said: ''He had a drink in him. I was swearing at him and trying to
push him off, but he had my arms pinned down with his hands, and then
his legs.
''He wouldn't take no for an answer. There is no way he could have
thought I was willing.''
She told the court that after he made her commit a sex act: ''I was
kicking about with my feet and I think it was then I managed to get him
off. Then he jumped out the window. I felt like going down to the
nearest chemist and stuffing 100 paracetamol down my throat. I wanted to
die.''
The girl said she was in a state of shock and at first did not tell
anyone. Eventually she spoke about her alleged ordeal to a member of
staff.
The girl added: ''I didn't want her to tell the police, but she said
she had to or she would get into trouble.''
Questioned by defence Advocate Robert Anthony, the girl denied she had
been a willing participant in a brief sexual encounter and that she was
not telling the truth.
She admitted she had told staff to ''f... off'' when they originally
came to her room to look for the boys.
Mr Anthony added: ''You didn't tell staff where the boys were hiding,
when they came looking and you had ample opportunity to leave the room
through an unlocked door and into a corridor beforehand. It just doesn't
tally.''
She said she was scared of the boy. ''When he raped me, I was shouting
for the staff but no-one heard me,'' she said.
She also agreed she was not injured in the alleged attack, and that
her clothing had not been damaged.
The trial continues.

PLANS to privatise the operations of Companies House in Edinburgh were
described as ''madness'' yesterday.
Companies House contains the Register of Companies for Scotland and it
is feared the Government move would mean it coming under English
control.
A Department of Trade and Industry newspaper advertisement has invited
would-be contractors to apply for information and questionnaire packs.
The move has already led to a one-day strike and the introduction of
an overtime ban by the Civil Service unions involved.
The whole of the Edinburgh operation, which employs 45 people, is
being considered for contracting out: the setting-up of new companies,
provision of information on registered companies, and the processing of
annual returns and other information.
The Scottish spokesman for the Civil and Public Services Association,
Mr Michael McCann, said: ''If they go ahead with this, it is nothing
short of madness. It has been shown that the high quality of the service
at present cannot be beaten.''
Mr Mike Crimmins of the CPSA, the Cardiff-based co-ordinator of the
union campaign, said one of their concerns for the Scottish service was
that it would no longer be independent and would come under the control
of an English-based company.
A DTI spokesman said: ''Basically, it is essential that the contractor
maintains or improves the current level of service. Unless that can be
demonstrated, contracting out will not go ahead.''.

A VERDICT is expected today in the trial of a schoolboy who denies
five sex offences.
At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, the prosecution withdrew a
number of lesser charges against the 15-year-old.
The youth, who lives in a children's home, still faces five charges.
He denies raping a woman twice and four charges of assaulting four women
with intent to rape them.
It is claimed the alleged incidents took place in Govanhill, Glasgow,
on July 2 and December 2 last year.
Women have given evidence claiming they were dragged into closes and
assaulted.
At the conclusion of the Crown case yesterday, the prosecutor, Mr
Michael O'Grady, told Lord McCluskey that he was withdrawing a number of
other charges.
These include four charges of placing six women in a state of fear and
alarm, and four allegations of indecent assault against a teenage girl,
who was a resident in the same children's home as the accused.
The boy cannot be named for legal reasons.
The jury of 12 men and three women will be asked to consider their
verdict today.

A YOUNG shop assistant alerted rescuers by wriggling her pink-painted
toenails and was pulled alive from a collapsed Seoul department store
today after miraculously surviving 12 days under tonnes of rubble.
Rescuers lifted Yoo Ji-hwan, 18, from the wreckage where she had lain
practically immobile since the June 29 disaster which is feared to have
killed 400 people, surviving on only rainwater and willpower.
She was discovered in what had been the Sampoong Department Store's
second basement level and released from her entombment after two hours
of frantic digging by a small army of rescue workers.
''I was digging in the rubble when I saw something moving inside a
small hole,'' said rescue worker Chong Sang-won. ''I realised it was a
foot and when I shouted 'move it if you're alive', the toes began to
wiggle from side to side.''
Yoo was even well enough to joke with her rescuers, saying ''I'd like
to stay here for a few more days.''
''I'm all right. I just want a cup of ice coffee -- and I want to go
home,'' a smiling Yoo told reporters from her hospital bed.
''I'm so happy,'' Yoo's invalid father Yoo Gun-chang told state
television from the hospital where he has been treated for chronic
illness for three years, tears trickling down his cheeks after being
told of his daughter's survival.
After medical checks, doctors said Yoo was badly dehydrated but
otherwise in fairly good health.
She was put into the bed next to that of another miracle survivor from
the store rubble, Choi Myong-sok, 21, rescued on Sunday and already well
on his way to a complete recovery.
''I'm in a very good mood,'' Yoo's mother Chong Kwang-im told
reporters at the hospital. ''I firmly believed she must be alive after
hearing the news that Choi was rescued alive.''
Eight more bodies were retrieved from the wreckage today, bringing the
official death toll to 212, with about 230 still missing.

CONSUMERS could see their water bills calculated in a significantly
different way, if there is a change of government at the next election.
Labour is in favour of basing bills on Council Tax bands, instead of
rateable values.
Mr John Gummer, Environment Secretary, has already rejected the idea,
which is being pushed hard by several of the 10 major water companies in
England and Wales.
The Government believes a change could lead to unfair increases in
bills for many customers, and favours a switch to metering in the long
term.
However, Labour is concerned that water meters persuade many poor
people to scrimp, and fears that widespread metering could have serious
health implications.
''We think you could devise a system based on Council Tax bands which
would be fair,'' said a spokeswoman for Shadow Environment Minister Joan
Ruddock. ''And we are certainly against compulsory water metering.''
There is widespread agreement that the current rateable, value-based
system is out-of-date, mainly because the rates no longer exist.
The system was due to end in 1990. But in April Mr Gummer told
Parliament the Government had changed its mind.
* Water quality in the River Forth catchment area has shown signs of
improvement over the past five years, according to the latest report of
the Forth River Purification Board.
The report, published today, shows that there was a 30% reduction in
polluted freshwater in the area, and a threefold increase in Class 1
unpolluted water in the Firth of Forth.
Offshore water in the Firth is said to have remained at a high
standard, although 40% of inshore coastal water remained polluted by
sewage. The report called for increased investment in modern sewage
disposal schemes.
All six EC identified bathing water sites in the Forth met the
required environmental standards in 1994, and beaches at Elie,
Aberdour's Silversands, and Gullane in East Lothian won beach awards.

WHEN it comes to offering a high quality of life, Perth recently came
out on top in the whole of the UK. The prosperous town lies within easy
reach of the rest of Scotland, yet has excellent leisure facilities and
scenery right on its doorstep. It also has a wide range of property.
Anyone who wants to share in that quality of life should have a look
at a new development at Riverview Park where some 18 flats have views
across the River Tay and into the town.
Located close to the river, the development is within easy walking
distance of the city centre.
Two stepped buildings each contain nine apartments offering a range of
sizes and layouts. The main accommodation has south-west facing views
over the river.
Surrounded by private landscaped gardens with parking facilities,
Riverview Park has already attracted considerable interest with several
flats now sold.
All of the flats have terraces which are paved and the main bedrooms
have a bath or shower room en-suite. Quality finishes include hardwood
moulded skirtings and faces.
Prices start at #88,000 rising to #97,000 for the show flat which
includes carpets. The flats are being marketing by joint selling agents
DTZ Debenham Thorpe and Kippen Campbell Property Services.
Meanwhile, DTZ is also marketing a new development of flats in
Edinburgh. Park View consists of 16 flats overlooking Holyrood Park at
St Leonards Hill, Pleasance, with prices starting from #73,500.
John Brown, director of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, says: ''These flats are
finished to a very high standard and are larger than other new flats in
a similar price bracket. AMA Homes have an excellent reputation for
quality and finish and each Park View property is sold with a private
car parking space.''

IT is the golfer's ultimate dream come true -- the chance to have
one's very own course on one of Scotland's most beautiful islands.
With the Scottish Open starting at Carnoustie today, what better way
for the winner to use his prize money than put it towards buying Islay's
historic Machrie course, which is now up for sale at offers over
#250,000. The 18-hole, par 71 links on the island was laid more than 100
years ago and soon won a reputation as one of Scotland's finest.
Covering about 266 acres on the west coast, it hosted the first
100-professional open championship in 1901 and attracted the famous
golfing Triumvirate of J H Taylor, James Braid, and Harry Vardon.
The Islay Golf Club has 280 members, but the course is played by
Islay's many visitors, charmed by its views over the silver sands of
Laggan Bay and the open Atlantic six miles away across the bay.
The course is overlooked by the Paps of Jura on the neighbouring
island.
Evelyn Bell, of selling agents, Savills, said that Harry Vardon had
waxed lyrical about Machrie's setting.
Vardon wrote of the course ''where the most glorious golf is to be
obtained''. He said the third hole was one of the most difficult he had
ever played.
And if you can't achieve the par 71, then you can drown your sorrows
sampling Islay's excellent whiskies which include Laphroaig, Lagavulin,
Bowmore, Bruichladdich, and Bunnahabhainn.

TAKE A fairly new house, about four years old, not in Glasgow's city
centre but near the outskirts. Five apartments with double glazing,
central heating, a decent garden and parking space. All for #175 a
month.
Alternatively same area, same development. This time a two-apartment
flat for #90 a month.
They belong to the Tollcross Housing Association, and are a reminder
that there are more ways of finding accommodation than buying or renting
in the private sector.
With the Halifax and Nationwide reporting house prices continuing to
fall, in the South anyway, and at least one builder deciding to give up
business altogether, people looking for a house can be forgiven for
wondering how best to proceed.
Michael Dawson, deputy director with Tollcross, describes his
association's approach. ''Housing need is the basis on which we
operate,'' he says. ''Our business plan makes our purpose quite clear --
to add to the quality of life in the East End of Glasgow by obtaining
the best possible living conditions for the people of Tollcross.''
This particular association is community-based, looking to the needs
of those in its area: others may include workshop space in their
developments. They are providers of social rented housing to those in
need and on limited income.
Are these associations, then, some kind of threat to the usual
providers of rented properties in the private sector? Unfair competition
perhaps?
''Not at all,'' Michael Dawson replies. ''Complementary in a way. We
operate under guidelines from Scottish Homes. We are obliged not to take
into account ability to pay. We have to cover our costs, but the money
people have is not the criterion.
''We have students as tenants. We have people on housing benefit --
that applies to probably more than half of our tenants. About 33% are
pensioners.
''What it means is that most of our people could not afford housing,
apart from association property. The Government appear to want
associations like ours to take over Scottish Homes's stock.
''This is permanent housing, not for a year or so while you do some
local work. And there is very little private rented accommodation in
this particular area. There is little work also. How can people cope,
with no income, and no place to stay?
''We are not competing with the private sector. We have a different
role to play. We are helping the financially vulnerable. We are also
helping to maintain a community, and retain a measure of stability.
''If we didn't exist, think what the result would be. As it is, we can
seek private capital for projects. Our own association owns almost 700
housing units. Most are flats which have been refurbished, with a few
detached houses.
''Our latest project was #3.5m of new-build work, in London Road, with
about 73% in housing association grant. We are really the only people
building substantially today for social rent for those on low income.
''One simple fact shows the situation. We have ten times as many
applications as we can ever cover. There is a huge need, and it is going
unmet.''

A RECORD compensation award for passive smoking has been won from
Stockport metropolitan borough by the trade union Unison.
In an out-of-court settlement, Stockport cleaning services manager Mrs
Beryl Roe has received #25,000 after a seven-year battle to support her
claim that a lack of adequate ventilation resulted in her being exposed
to high levels of cigarette smoke.
Mrs Roe, 59, worked in the same council division, education, as
Veronica Bland, 36, who two years ago made history by gaining #15,000
compensation for health damage caused by passive smoking.
Mrs Roe retired on health grounds in 1987 after suffering eye, nose,
and throat symptoms and bronchial hypersensitivity.
Last night, Mrs Roe said she was delighted with the settlement and the
support she had received from Unison.
She made the point that she was not against smokers or smoking, but
against the council for doing nothing to protect her from inhaling
cigarette smoke.
Unison health and safety officer Sarah Copsey said this second
settlement should be a warning to other employers.
A council spokesman emphasised that Stockport council was a caring
employer and had played a leading role in pioneering a no-smoking
policy.

SCOTLAND is to receive #14m of aid under a European Union initiative
to tackle the social and economic difficulties caused by the
restructuring of the fishing industry.
Grampian is to receive more than #7m, the Highlands and Islands #3m,
and Tayside, Fife, the Borders, and the South-west will also benefit
from the ''Pesca'' initiative.
Under the scheme, local authorities and economic agencies, in
partnership with industry, will be able to get grants for projects which
contribute to economic diversification and job creation. Grants can also
be used to strengthen existing industry activities. Action groups are
being set up to deliver Pesca funding at local level.
The four-year initiative is aimed at diversifying the economy of
communities highly dependent on fishing, through assistance for new
business projects, training, and marketing.
The money will be matched by public and private-sector contributions.
''This is very good news for many areas around the Scottish coast
where communities depend on the fishing industry,'' said Mr Raymond
Robertson MP, the new Fisheries Minister at the Scottish Office.
''The Pesca money will be of considerable benefit in helping them cope
with the effects of changes in the fishing industry.''
Highlands and Islands Enterprise will run the programme on behalf of
the EU and the Scottish Office in its area, with decision-making
devolved to a series of locally-based Pesca groups. The first projects
are expected to be approved within the next three months, a spokesman
said.
The agency's director of European affairs, Mr Iain MacAskill, said it
would be seeking to achieve a balance between development of
diversification opportunities within fishing -- such as harvesting new
species -- and others outwith the industry, for example tourism-related
schemes.
The agency expects the #3.5m of EC money to be matched by the public
sector, with a further #2.3m coming from the private sector.
Around 3000 people in the HIE area earn their living from the sea but
restrictions on fishing to preserve fish stocks are causing problems for
communities.
Outline plans drawn up by the local Pesca groups have identified fish
catching, processing, and aqua-culture as areas requiring action. The
Pesca groups' aims also reflect different geographical priorities. In
Argyll, for example, resources will be targeted at the Kintyre peninsula
and Islay, while the programme in Ross and Cromarty will be focused on
Wester Ross.

A BUTCHER accused of murdering his own son allegedly claimed he saw
another man carrying out the killing.
The High Court in Glasgow was told that Mr Patrick Harte, 47, had
claimed he saw a man ''finishing off'' his son, Patrick, 21.
He allegedly told his brother Mr Gerard Harte, 33, while in Barlinnie
Prison awaiting trial, that he was wakened by his son Patrick shouting,
then saw him lying at the bottom of the stairs and a stranger killing
him before vanishing from the house.
Mr Gerard Harte, also a butcher, of Shilton Drive, Priesthill,
Glasgow, said his brother told him this after his arrest.
However, during a police tape-recorded interview played in court
yesterday the accused man denied seeing anyone in the house the night
his son died. He said: ''I never saw anyone.''
Mr Patrick Harte, of Midlothian Drive, Pollokshaws, Glasgow, denies
murdering his son.
Detective Inspector Randal Bear, 46, said that Mr Patrick Harte did
not seem distressed when told his son was dead.
His head was almost severed from his body and he had bled to death by
the time he reached the city's Victoria Infirmary, Dr Martin McKechnie,
28, said.
Mr Patrick Harte, who owns a butcher's shop at Pollokshaws Road, said
he kept carving knives around the house. However, he denied knowledge of
a large bloodstained knife found in a bowl of water in the sink after
the killing.
The trial continues.

THE flamboyant husband and wife law team struck off after being found
guilty of professional misconduct broke their silence yesterday to make
a series of startling allegations against the Scottish legal
establishment.
Maria and Gordon Thomson, who are appealing the decision to take away
their practising certificates, talked to The Herald at their luxury
Edinburgh home.
They claimed the Law Society of Scotland had tainted their name with
false allegations of fraud and dishonesty.
''The way they presented things in the press and the way the press has
presented things to the public means we had to speak out now. It is in
our interest, because they (the public) have only had one side,'' Mr
Thomson said.
The pair revealed the reasons behind their decision to plead guilty to
a number of allegations set out in a 125-page judgment by the Scottish
Solicitors Discipline Tribunal.
The tribunal described the couple's case as undoubtedly the worst of
its kind for a number of years. It criticised the Thomsons' firm for
being ''fee driven'', with assistants ''commonly subjected to abuse . .
. if set targets had not been achieved''.
There were allegations of touting for clients, Legal Aid board
application forms not being filled in correctly, and one of their staff
appearing in court without the proper practising certificate.
The Thomsons talked of their anger and bitterness caused by two years
of legal wrangling which cost them #150,000 and which finally resulted
in both of them losing their practising certificates.
The couple said they ''had copped a plea'' at the tribunal partly for
financial reasons and partly because they expected just to be fined.
They said 180 of the 200 allegations had been thrown out.
The couple accused the legal establishment of a ''vendetta and witch
hunt'' and claimed they were picked on because they were successful.
They also made a string of allegations against leading members of the
legal establishment. Mrs Thomson claimed that a prominent partner in an
Edinburgh firm had assaulted one of their staff members at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court.
Mr Thomson, who rides a motor cycle, said that, in the solicitors'
rooms at the courts at Kirkcaldy, he had coffee poured into his
motor-cycling boots. He also claimed cases would be called when he was
not in court so he would get in trouble with the sheriff.
Mrs Thomson claimed that solicitors put up pornographic cartoons
implying that the company got clients by offering sexual favours. In
allegations relating to the case against them, Mr Thomson claimed that a
senior east coast lawyer promised to drop complaints in return for
passing on business.
He added that there was a marked difference between the attitude of
east and west coast lawyers and that he had been told the Edinburgh Bar
was the unfriendliest in the country and that had been correct.
The couple claimed ''unbelievable rumours'' had circulated about their
firm, including one that they gave drugs to their clients. Another was
that paralegals, not fully-qualified solicitors, were offering sexual
favours to partners.
Reacting to criticism of the way his staff were treated, Mr Thomson
accepted that, at times in the firm, just like a family, ''voices had
been raised''.
Regarding their dealings with the Scottish Legal Aid Board, he said:
''We sent in 30 files a day for two years to the Legal Aid Board. In
that time, all that came out was six alterations (on files). I don't
believe any firm in this country could have stood up to that level of
checking.''
Questioned about the charge that one of their staff appeared at court
without being properly qualified, he said: ''Ninety per cent of
solicitors in this country involved in criminal work appeared the day
after their first year finishes, as long as you get permission from the
sheriff clerk. He did get permission from the sheriff clerk.''
Controversy has walked hand in hand with the couple since they started
their own firm four years ago in the Sighthill estate in Edinburgh.
To the punters, they were unlike other lawyers they had known. Mr
Thomson was the motor-bike riding, long-haired legal eagle who rubbed
the establishment up the wrong way. Maria dazzled them with her dress
sense.
As their business grew, the couple started dealing with clients in
Fife and had a staff of around 30 people. It was the growth of the firm
that they said caused ''adminstrative problems'' which led to their
difficulties with the Law Society.
As the success continued, they started advertising on television, and
the style of the late-night commercials shocked the legal establishment.
Soaring profits, the use of paralegals, increased numbers of clients,
and a business programme also allegedly caused anger and resentment.
Now the couple have been told not to have any contact with the firm
they set up, which effectively means the partners left running the firm
could sell it on and keep the money.

Viktor Chernomyrdin, 57, prime minister. The likely favourite if
Yeltsin dropped out of the race. His profile has soared since he
personally negotiated the release of hundreds of hostages held by
Chechen gunmen last month. Former chairman of state gas monopoly
Gazprom. His political bloc Our Home is Russia has a strong network.
Alexander Lebed 45, army general. Popular and outspoken critic of the
Russian authorities and the military campaign to crush independence
moves in Chechnya. Commanded the 14th Army in Moldova until last month,
when he resigned in protest at government plans to downgrade the force.
Has declared he is entering politics.
Svyatoslav Fyodorov, 67, eye surgeon. Won worldwide fame with
pioneering laser eye surgery in 1970s. Created Party of Workers'
Self-government to contest December parliamentary election and help him
in presidential poll, for which he has declared his candidacy. His fame
should work in his favour.
Mikhail Gorbachev, 64, former Soviet leader. Now very much an
outsider, his reform policies have been widely discredited at home and
blamed for the collapse of the Soviet Union and economic recession. He
has said he is thinking of running. Perceived by many in West as man of
the century, but not man of the moment in Russia.
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 49, ultra-nationalist. His party took a big
chunk of the vote in the 1993 parliamentary election. Although pundits
suggest he is unlikely to be winner, his roguish manner and populist
slogans mean he remains a wild card. Viewed with suspicion and distaste
in the West for his unpredictable antics.

Anne Simpson reports on the ails of the president who pulled the plug
on communism's respirator
FIVE years ago, this summer, one man above all symbolised the re-birth
of his country.
A man of powerful Slavic build whose expensive suit only accentuated
the boozy lustre of his peasant pride. But Boris Yeltsin, in his prime,
knew instinctively what his fellow citizens desired. Newly elected as
Speaker of the Russian Parliament, the Duma, he declared the sovereignty
vote to cheering deputies whose overwhelming choice (907 votes to 13)
was that the federation should override the Soviet Union. By the
following June Yeltsin had consolidated that position by becoming
Russia's first democratically elected president, his triumph secured by
57% of the poll.
Two months later there he was, standing on top of a tank to defend
this fragile democracy against the clumsiness of an attempted coup as
the old guard moved against Mikhail Gorbachev still clinging to the
presidency of an impotent empire; man of the century certainly but never
sworn in by popular vote and thus lacking his old enemy's surest
credential.
Gorbachev, ostensibly held hostage in his luxurious Crimean dacha, and
Yeltsin, braving hard-line artillery to join protesting thousands
outside the Parliament. . . suddenly these contrasting images defined
the two men's significance in people's minds.
Gorby's perestroika might have ended the Cold War but Yeltsin, the
loudmouth, had proved a shrewder listener and the grassroots were
telling him that the Soviet Union could never revive momentum or achieve
a human face.
On that August day he may have saved Gorbachev's job and possibly his
life but before the year was out Yeltsin had engineered the other man's
resignation and the collapse of a bankrupt state.
It was Christmas Day when Boris Yeltsin finally pulled the plug on
communism's respirator. Since then much promise has disintegrated. More
than 80% of the Russian population are worse off than before, with a
monstrous number living well below any recognised poverty level. Rouble
inflation is around 7% a month, and the non-payment of wages to miners,
electricity workers, even doctors and teachers is not uncommon.
Meanwhile in Moscow, an emerging entrepreneurial class reaps fat
salaries from banking and private enterprise, but very often dirty money
underpins such activities, giving the Mafia and corrupt bureaucrats
sinister clout.
As a result, the first and overwhelming impression of the country for
a stranger is one of being ransacked, a place where cowboys violate any
understanding of ethical behaviour and certain military officials have
forced a flailing president to blunder into the grotesque fiasco of
Chechnya.
So Yeltsin, the unpolished, the unpredictable, has now lost all
credibility as the architect of reform and, while a derailing mixture of
alcohol and medicinal drugs may have been early contributors to his
declining hold on strategy, there is no doubt that the Chechen
hostilities and the pressure inflicted on him by an outraged Duma have
added to Yeltsin's unravelling reputation.
For many Russians this vision of a puffy-faced president stumbling
about the world, insulting other leaders by his unpunctuality and
bufoonish antics, offers discomforting deja vu. Isn't this how Brezhnev
embarrassed us by ending his days, they muse.
But even then the living conditions of the masses were stable,
excruciatingly dull but stable. Whoever heard of unemployment behind the
Iron Curtain? Such thinking often confounds people's present and
terrible disillusion with power and civil authority, and although
Yeltsin has never wavered from his commitment that parliamentary
elections will be held in December, and the presidental poll next June,
electoral law has recently been altered to lower the minimum valid
turnout.
And, despite the drunken bumpkin image at home and abroad, Yeltsin
does still possess enough bucolic cunning and thunder to play one hungry
politician against the other.
Last week, to consolidate support in the crucial ''force'' ministries,
he elevated his Chechnya commander, Anatoly Kolikov, to the post of
interior minister. In effect this means that Kolikov now not only
presides over the Russian troops in the warring province but over an
interior ministry army whose presence is increasingly evident on
Moscow's streets.
At 800,000-strong it has now begun to rival the size of the country's
defence force, thus worrying defence minister, Pavel Grachev. But
Kolikov's appointment also allows the president a tighter rein on his
clever prime minister.
Viktor Chernomyrdim, prime minister, an old pal and ally, recently
seized the initiative while Yeltsin was turning in one more woozy
performance at the G7 summit in Canada. In one sense it was a rash move
because it has undoubtedly won favour with the public: Chernomyrdim
negotiated with the Chechen hostage-taker, Shamil Basayv in Budyonnovsk
to release those kidnapped, and also instigated political talks between
both sides.
Officially, of course, Yeltsin remains at one with his PM whom he
instructed, not long ago, to form the pro-presidential party, Our House
Is Russia in the belief that every bureaucrat and state worker wishing
to secure his job, and every businessman happy with his bulging wallet,
would swear allegiance. Should Chernomyrdin fail to deliver, Yeltsin is
assembling from competing factions a wide range of political candidates
who would be acceptable to the new Duma.
That said, Chernomyrdin, a watchful, bloodless technocrat, has proved
he can get things done, and his own possible claim on Russia's top job
may be enhanced by Yeltsin's illness: the constitution demands that if
the president is incapacitated or dies, the immediate transference of
power is to the prime minister.
The persisent danger, however, is that a new leadership would be
extremely nationalistic and anti-Western, although the likelihood of the
fascist Vladimir Zhirinovsky assuming control has diminished greatly
since his dramatic parliamentary success in 1993.
Freemarket optimists believe his fist fights and contradictory
statements may have finally inoculated the electorate against him; at
present he rates about 5% in the polls. Even so, no-one can entirely
discount the sly pull of Zhirinovsky's oafish hatreds and
rabble-rousing.
Such are the dark shadows which have lengthened over Boris Yeltsin's
spluttering democracy. His first aberration was to destroy his people's
hero stature by turning the tanks against his own political foes in
1993, but since then the speed of privatisation has propelled much into
disarray, very often sidelining the government's influence.
Yet, perhaps the greatest achievement has been the adoption of a
constitution which lays down rules for the political process and
establishes the foundation of a law-based state. Could the new
authoritarians improve the situation for the majority? Hardly. Too many
fundamental changes have taken place in Russia for it ever to retreat to
what it was. And, although incompatible with an orderly society, the
very prevalence of organised crime ensures the ruin now of clenched
centralised control.
Any drunken bumpkin knows that, and, as the president and his cronies
also know, Yeltsin may be thoroughly unpopular until you consider the
alternatives.

A TROUBLED young mother who drowned her two sons and sent rescuers on
a sensational nine-day manhunt for a non-existent kidnapper was found
mentally competent today to stand trial for the murders.
South Carolina Circuit Judge William Howard issued the ruling after
Susan Smith, 23, who has confessed to the killings, said she understood
courtroom procedures.
She is accused of drowning Michael, three, and 14-month-old Alex last
October 25 by allowing her car to roll into a lake with the children
strapped in the back seat.--Reuter.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton extended full diplomatic relations to Vietnam
today, 20 years and two months after the last American ambassador
escaped from the roof of his embassy in Saigon by helicopter.
The president said that the decision would help the United States
''move forward on an issue that has for so long divided us.'' He
referred to the protracted and bitter dispute between supporters and
opponents of the war that continues to this day.
Clinton made the announcement in the White House, surrounded by
government officials and many veterans of the war.
Most prominent veterans in Congress support him, but there are still a
few who disagree. Bob Dornan, a veteran who is Republican Congressman in
California and is running for the presidential nomination, persists in
calling Clinton a draft-dodger because he refused to serve in Vietnam.
The issue that has postponed recognition for so long is the question
of the American servicemen who disappeared in Indochina during the war
and whose remains have not been discovered.
For many years a vocal lobby, including many of the families of these
Prisoners of War-Missing in Action (POW-MIA), insisted that many or all
the missing were still alive.
Only a paranoid fringe can still believe it, 22 years after American
involvement in the war ended. All the same, the US government continues
to devote large resources to look for the remains.
The president said today that only 55 ''discrepancy cases'' remain,
meaning cases of servicemen who the Pentagon has reason to believe
survived being shot down over Indochina or who were known to have been
taken prisoner.
He said that the government of Vietnam continues to be helpful and has
promised full co-operation in dealing with these cases.
The president also said that recognising Vietnam would push it faster
along the road of economic and political liberalisation. He said that
the two governments were discussing other issues, including human
rights, particularly freedom of religion.
Trade relations were resumed last year, but Vietnam has not yet been
accorded ''most favoured nation'' (MFN) status, and its exports
therefore have to pay much higher duties than those from its neighbours.
If it can satisfy the American government that it is conforming to
international standards on human rights, it will get MFN.
That will chiefly depend, however, on how today's announcement is
received in the United States. If it passes quietly, then the Vietnam
war will at last recede into history.
Clinton's decision to establish diplomatic relations drew a mixed
reaction in Congress and threats to block its implementation.
Supporters of normalised ties between the former enemies called
Clinton's move courageous and predicted economic and security benefits
for the United States.
Opponents said Vietnam did not deserve recognition because it was
still not fully co-operating in accounting for American Vietnam war
prisoners and missing in action, and because it was a communist state
accused of human rights violations.
Early congressional reaction fell mostly along party lines, with the
significant exception of Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and
former prisoner of war in Vietnam, who has taken a leading role in
advocating normalisation. McCain was with Clinton when he made his
announcement.
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and New Hampshire Republican Bob
Smith introduced legislation in May banning funding for the new embassy
in Hanoi until Clinton certified the Vietnamese had provided ''full
disclosure'' on the POW/MIA issue.
Smith said he may offer a similar measure as a rider to a bill next
week. But Dole in a Senate speech indicated he would take a longer view,
saying that ''in the coming weeks and months Congress will monitor the
progress of relations with Vietnam''.
The first direct confrontation on Clinton's announcement was expected
in the House tomorrow when the International Relations Committee hears
administration witnesses on Vietnam's record of co-operation on
accounting for MIA/POWs.
The committee's chairman, Republican Representative Benjamin Gilman,
of New York, has warned the administration that ''premature action'' on
recognition would result in a ban on funding.
But McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam for five and a half years,
said Clinton had shown ''courage and honour'' and normalising relations
was ''the right thing to do''.
Democrats supporting the move said it was ''the next logical step''
and cited potential economic benefits and Vietnamese help in seeking
missing Americans.
Reaction was also mixed outside of Congress.
California Governor Pete Wilson, a Republican presidential hopeful,
called recognition premature and said it rewarded Hanoi for its
persecution of the Vietnamese people and a half-hearted programme of
economic reform.
The commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Allen Kent,
has said the group does not oppose normalisation if it furthered full
accounting of the missing.-

PRESIDENT Yeltsin, taken to hospital in Moscow yesterday with a
worsening of ischaemic heart disease, has been at risk from the
condition on four counts, a British expert says.
''He's certainly got high blood pressure and he's overweight, he
drinks a lot, and has a high-stress job,'' said Dr Ian Baird of the
British Heart Foundation.
''He had at least four triggers for ischaemic heart disease.''
Ischaemia, which comes from Greek, means an inadequate supply of blood
and oxygen to an organ or tissue. Caused by a build-up of plaque
blocking an artery, it can lead to a heart attack or stroke.
The blocking, atherosclerosis, can be treated with drugs or surgery,
but often worsens if patients do not also make radical changes in their
lifestyles.
Sedentary people who overeat are especially at risk from the
condition, which kills more people in industrialised countries than any
other disease.
A Russian announcement said Mr Yeltsin's ''painful attack'' had been
relieved. The president was moving around and would not change his plans
for the next week.
''It could be an impending heart attack or it could be a severe attack
of angina (chest pain),'' said Dr Baird.
''But it's clear that he has got ischaemic heart disease and that he
will have to have some further investigation for that.''
Unusually for a Russian, Mr Yeltsin does not seem to smoke. But Dr
Baird said that otherwise the 64-year-old president appeared to be a
prime candidate for heart problems. The Russian lifestyle, he said,
certainly does seem to increase the risk of heart disease.
The standard Russian diet is heavy in fat and very light on fruit and
vegetables. A high intake of fat, especially animal fat, is strongly
linked with heart disease.
Mr Yeltsin does make an effort to exercise, but his tennis is
described as bad. There is no evidence he puts in the 20 minutes, three
times a week of brisk exercise that doctors recommend as the minimum to
keep the heart healthy.
While light drinking, especially of red wine, has been linked with
lower mortality from heart disease, heavy drinking worsens the odds and
raises blood pressure.
In 1987, Mr Yeltsin had a nervous collapse, but described symptoms,
such as chest pains, that could have indicated a heart problem. He wrote
of being kept in bed with ''drips and injections''.
Dr Baird said drugs such as heparin could ease the symptoms of
ischaemic heart disease, while a clot-busting drug like streptokinase
would stave off a heart attack.

ONE way of affording a country house is to acquire one which comes
with its own business. Waterybutts Lodge, near Errol on the northern
shore of the Firth of Tay between Perth and Dundee, offers a combination
of country life with an established guest house enterprise.
Standing on the site of a fifteenth-century Friary attached to Coupar
Angus Abbey, Waterybutts is thought to be only the latest of several
dwellings to have occupied this location over the centuries.
Built of stone in the early nineteenth-century, the Lodge features
nine bedrooms with private facilities, together with drawing room,
dining room and a large kitchen equipped for catering, living room and
domestic offices.
A range of traditional outbuildings set around a small courtyard
complements the house and offers considerable scope for further
expansion, while the grounds extend to 3.75acres with patio, gardens,
paddocks, mature trees and shrubs. A feature of the grounds is the
well-stocked kitchen garden including an exceptional herb garden.
Bruce Osborne, of chartered surveyor Bidwells, says: ''The house was
substantially upgraded in 1990, and has been run as a successful guest
house, specialising in providing an informal 'house party' style for
visitors enjoying the country pursuits of Perthshire.''
The property has been re-wired, re-plumbed, and the central heating
upgraded.
Waterybutts Lodge has a Highly Commended (Three Crowns) rating from
the Scottish Tourist Board and has appeared in many guides, including
the 1995 edition of A Taste of Scotland. Offers over #250,000 are
invited for the property.

AN ELITE task force of British and Dutch commandos, landing ships,
command ships, helicopters, and fast inflatable boats was on standby
last night for operations in Bosnia.
The force is ready to be called in to boost protection for UN troops
because of delays in securing Croatian permission to deploy the Army's
24 Airmobile Brigade.
The amphibious force could also be used to help a mass withdrawal of
peacekeepers if the situation worsens.
Units and warships have been placed on 10 days' notice to move to the
Adriatic.
The advance party of 400 from 24 Airmobile Brigade has been waiting
for more than a week for the green light to deploy but any hopes it
would be finally on the way today have been dashed because of protracted
negotiations over the use of the private port of Ploce, south of Split.
Talks over the port's use were continuing last night.
It is understood the naval task force's troops are centred on 42
Commando from Bickleigh, Devon, and the 1st Battalion the Royal
Netherlands Marine Corps.
They also include the HQ staff of 3 Commando Brigade, reconnaissance
troops from the Household Cavalry Regiment, an air defence troop with
Javelin missile systems, forward air controllers, engineers, and other
support units.
The task force would be spearheaded by the 20,000-ton aircraft carrier
Invincible, carrying a mix of Sea King helicopters and Sea Harrier
jump-jets.
Medical facilities would be reactivated after having been
''mothballed'' aboard a Gulf war hospital ship, the 28,000-ton aviation
training ship Argus.
Argus would also operate some of the marines' Sea King Mk IV
helicopters, and 3 Commando Brigade's air squadron of Lynx and Gazelle
helicopters at Yeovilton, Somerset, would deploy.
Three 5500-ton landing ships, equipped with rigid raider inflatables,
and a supply ship would also play key roles.
The naval task force would have none of the basing problems currently
delaying 24 Airmobile Brigade's deployment.
''When the difficulties of deploying 24 Airmobile Brigade emerged, the
commando and naval forces were placed on standby,'' said a defence
source. ''It is taking much longer to move the brigade than expected.
''The commando force would be able to operate from a secure base at
sea in the Adriatic, which requires no permission.
''It would be able to move inshore quickly to extract peacekeepers in
trouble and withdraw just as rapidly without any of the problems of
being based actually on the ground with the threat of reprisals.''

IF the United Nations hesitates too long before asking Nato to pull
its peacekeepers out of Bosnia, the operation could become a high-risk
rescue rather than a planned withdrawal, Western military sources say.
In the event of peacekeeping forces being sucked into open conflict as
the weather worsens, Nato might have to fight its way in and out,
darkening what it already considers a ''horrible'' scenario.
Although the alliance's Determined Effort pull-out plan disregards
seasons, the low cloud, short days, snow, and mud of winter would make
the job much tougher, the sources claim.
As result Nato is worried that the UN might try to muddle through,
only to be confronted by a full-blown crisis.
''The UN . . . might try to go it alone with the added 12,500 men of
the Rapid Reaction Force. It might not ask until they're in big trouble,
caught up in a war,'' a senior Western military source said.
''If Nato gets called in at the last minute it becomes a rescue, which
is not what we want to do'', he added.
US officials in Washington, apparently pressing for action by
newly-arrived French and British re-inforcements, said on Monday that
the European force had only a few weeks to prove itself before a
decision must be made on a withdrawal.
The Rapid Reaction Force's role is not clear. As yet, it is not
''factored'' into the Nato withdrawal plan.
In some capitals, the force is seen as a powerful counter to
increasing Bosnian Serb hostility, poised, for example, to force a
supply corridor through to a besieged Sarajevo.
The UN however has said the force will not step outside the limited
confines of the Bosnia peace-keeping mandate.
Citing past evidence of prevarication, the military source said the
force was first mooted last December but ''put on ice'' after the former
American President Jimmy Carter brokered a four-month truce. ''Then we
had to get to the next crisis point.''
On Monday, US State Department spokesman Mr Nicholas Burns said it was
''commonly agreed that winter conditions in the Balkans would preclude a
major military operation''.
''Most people assume that, if you want to pull out by snowfall, the
decision would have to be made by August or so.''
Sources familiar with Determined Effort hint, however, that while Nato
would prefer a warm weather start, it would be ready to go in when
called on, whatever the season. They say October 15 is assumed as the
onset of winter in Bosnia.
Nato insists that it should have full control of a withdrawal, backed
by a clear mandate from the United Nations Security Council setting out
the task in unambiguous terms.
''For example, who do we take out? Do we take out aid workers, local
aid workers, their families? What if a peackeeping country says 'we're
staying on'?'' a senior military source said.
Nato has applied all its influence to ensure there is no fudging of
these issues in an eventual withdrawal resolution from New York and no
request for a piecemeal pull-out.
''Nato wants to trigger the whole plan at that point, that is, no
stopping and starting,'' the source added.
The plan, described as ''90% logistics'', foresees ''a ground
operation assuming the worst conditions'' along the two main land routes
out of Bosnia to the Adriatic coast.
''If everyone could take the closest exit, that would be best,'' the
source said. But in the case of isolated Muslim enclaves under UN
protection in eastern Bosnia, there was no guarantee that peacekeepers
could move out eastwards into Serbia proper.
The plan does not include an airlift from Sarajevo, a prospect which
would awaken memories of the US pull-out from Vietnam, the officer said.
There is no fixed order of withdrawal. ''It depends who needs to be
moved first.''-- Reuter.

Glasgow's West End has many unusual houses, but few of them can offer
their own tower - perched high above the Kelvin gorge. Lismore House is
the only detached property which backs on to the Botanic Gardens and
most of the rooms have leafy views of the park.
The house was built on Kelvin Drive in 1844 for a German Consul by his
wife as part of her wedding dowry! It still contains many period
features, including marble fireplaces, German light fittings, wood
panelling and carvings.
The main accommodation includes three reception rooms, four bedrooms,
two bathrooms, and a tower room. In addition, there is a recently
completed three bedroom, one reception room, self-contained flat at
garden level.
The hallway is entered through a carved oak arch. Similar supporting
pillars and further panelling predominate throughout the hallway and the
floor tiling has been retained. The drawing room has an oriel window
looking over the private garden into the m ature woodlands of Botanic
Gardens.
The country style kitchen has a large window looking south into
woodland. Victorian wall and floor cupboards have been restored with
similar natural timber worktops and handles.
One of the house's most unusual features is its Tower Room which has
six windows, looking out on all directions.
Lismore has its own well stocked private garden which screens the
house from Kelvin Drive and from visitors to the Botanic Gardens.
Alan Grant, manager of Roy Slater's West End branch which is marketing
the house, says: ''It's certainly one of a kind and it must have one of
the best locations in the city, minutes from the BBC and a short walk
from Glasgow University and Byres Road. We are expecting a lot of
interest.''
Lismore House is being sold at offers over #375,000.

ACTOR Hugh Grant was last night waiting for his second test before the
public after baring his soul on American television.
He sailed through the first of a round of chat show interviews to
promote his new film Nine Months, winning praise for the manner in which
he admitted: ''I did a bad thing.''
His new film, regarded as a vehicle to launch his career in the US,
premiered in Los Angeles last night.
The Four Weddings And A Funeral star was interviewed on Monday night,
for Jay Leno's Tonight Show, about his encounter with a Hollywood
prostitute.
''What the hell were you thinking?'' asked Leno. Although the actor
fidgeted and looked nervous, he did not make any excuses.
''I keep reading new psychological theories that I was under pressure,
I was overtired, I was lonely, I fell down the stairs as a child,'' he
said, but added that it would be wrong to hide behind that.
''You know in life what is a good thing and what is a bad thing. I did
a bad thing and there you have it.''
He also said he and girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley were attempting to
patch up their relationship.
''I've done an abominable thing and she's been amazing about it.
Contrary to what I read in the paper today, she's been very
supportive.''
Looking uncomfortable and sipping from a mug of water, he said he
could understand why there was so much interest in the encounter. He has
been charged with lewd conduct and the case is due to be heard next
week.
''I can see the juice in it. I can see where, if I hadn't been the
person who perpetrated this whole thing, I suppose I would be enjoying
it as much as anyone else. But it's pretty miserable on the other side
of the equation.''
The actor acknowledged that he deserved some of the flak which had
come his way but regretted the way his family had been exposed to the
attentions of the media.
He said: ''In a curious kind of way, I think I need to suffer for this
but it's bad when they are hassling your father.''
His public admission will help him come to terms with his guilt, said
psychologist Dr Dorothy Rowe.
''I thought it was a very honest thing to say. He is not trying to
make the kind of excuse Michael Douglas uses for his sex addiction by
saying, 'It's not my fault, it's something in my genes'.''
Grant has other interviews lined up this week and next, including one
with chat-show host David Letterman.
The actor is not expected to attend court when his case is heard. If
guilty, he faces up to six months in jail, although a fine is more
likely. He would also be required to have an Aids test.
The woman involved, Miss Stella Marie Thompson, 23, is expected to be
in court.
* Grant has also had a brush with London police -- this time for
allegedly speeding at nearly 100mph. He was listed to appear before
Exeter magistrates yesterday but did not turn up in court.
His case was adjourned until July 19 after a not guilty plea was
entered via a letter from his solicitors.
The actor's attendance next week was excused by the court as long as
his solicitor appears.
The 34-year-old, whose address was given as Chelsea, London, was
allegedly caught by a police camera driving his L-registered car at
98mph on the A38 at Kennford, near Exeter, on April 29.

NORWEGIAN agent Rune Hauge flew into London yesterday to defend Mr
George Graham, the former Arsenal manager, in the misconduct case
brought by the Football Association.
The agent at the heart of the ''bung'' allegations which brought down
the Arsenal manager earlier this year left his base in Guernsey to give
evidence on Mr Graham's behalf at the Watford hearing.
However, he shrugged aside all questions about what he told the
three-man FA commission as he waited for a taxi back to Heathrow
Airport.
''The air conditioning was good,'' was his reply, before curtly asking
journalists to leave him alone.
''I am not interested in speaking to you, so you might as well stop
asking questions. Do you understand?'' he added.
Mr Hauge's arrival at the hotel hosting the three-day hearing prompted
a rearrangement of the schedule, with the evidence of Arsenal chairman
Mr Peter Hill Wood and chief executive Mr Ken Friar delayed until the
afternoon session.
''All sides agreed that Hauge could appear and he was questioned from
10am to just before 1pm,'' said Mr David Davies, FA's director of public
affairs
The proceedings are due to conclude today with Mr Graham expected to
give his explanation of events before both sides' barristers sum up.
However, Mr Davies does not rule out the possibility of an adjournment
and said: ''It's not a court case and no-one can be sure how long it
will take.
''Three days have been set aside to see what progress one can make.
The key thing is that one is testing everything, not taking anything as
read, so that the case is heard fully and fairly.''
Mr Hauge, himself under investigation by the Norwegian tax
authorities, is thought to have insisted that Mr Graham was innocent of
any wrongdoing over the transfers of Pal Lydersen and John Jensen.
That is likely to have conflicted with the later three-and-a-half hour
account of Arsenal chairman and chief executive.
At the heart of the matter is #425,500 received by Mr Graham after the
transfers with IK Start and Brondby.
Both Scandinavian clubs allege that the deals were worth considerably
less than Arsenal's board of directors agreed to pay, with the
difference refunded to Interclub Ltd -- a Guernsey-based company linked
to Mr Hauge.
Interclub subsequently made two payments to Mr Graham, although he
insists they were an unsolicited gift unconnected to the transfers.
He repaid the money to Arsenal in December last year, two months
before the Premier League report which triggered his dismissal.
As on Monday, the hearing -- which involves three barristers and seven
other solicitors as well as the three commissioners, Mr Graham, and FA
officials -- broke up just before 6pm without comment from any of the
principals.

THE head of a Scottish secure school yesterday defended guidelines
which allow youngsters under the age of 16 to smoke.
Mr Tony Thompson, the chief executive of Rossie School, Montrose, said
the long-standing policy was a pragmatic approach when dealing with
''troubled and troublesome'' children, sent there by courts or the
children's panel.
He insisted that the school, which is run by an independent charity
and subject to regular Scottish Office inspections, followed a
non-smoking ethos and actively encouraged youngsters to stop smoking.
The guidelines allow children over the age of 14[1/2] to smoke if they
obtain written permission from their parents. The youngsters can use
pocket money to have staff buy the cigarettes but are restricted to a
maximum of four a day.
Mr Thompson said the policy was far from unusual in a secure
residential school, where ''many of the children are already smoking
20-a-day when they arrive''.
He added: ''If we banned it outright, we would only drive the problem
underground, with cigarettes inevitably smuggled in and a risk of fire
in locked rooms.''
Instead, he said, the children were allowed to smoke only in part of
the grounds, while staff were banned from smoking on the premises, or in
front of the youngsters.
Mr Thompson estimated that half of the 28 youngsters at the school
smoked but claimed the policy had persuaded a number of previous
residents to stop.
His comments followed an industrial tribunal in which a member of
staff at Rossie alleged unfair dismissal after an incident involving a
dispute about the smoking policy.
The tribunal upheld the claim of child care officer Timothy Caselton,
who was sacked after blowing water over Mr Donny Smith, another care
officer, last year.
Earlier, the tribunal was told, Mr Caselton, 42, and his colleague had
been ''arguing about the purchase of cigarettes for the children''.
Mr Caselton had been ''ribbed'' by Mr Smith, and ''blew'' a mouthful
of water over his clothing.
The tribunal decided that the dismissal was unfair but ruled that
reinstatement would not be acceptable. He was awarded compensation of
#14,440 but this was reduced by half because of Mr Caselton's
contribution to his dismissal and by a further 20% through his failure
to mitigate his loss by looking for other work.
A spokeswoman for Action on Smoking and Health said last night: ''We
don't want to see children smoking but we recognise the special
circumstances of this position and are pleased to see that help to stop
is offered.''

<HEADLINE>Safeway bid to thwart Co-op angers Isles councillor</HEADLINE>

THE vice-convener of Western Isles Islands Council yesterday released
a copy of a letter in which supermarket giant Safeway offered #375,000
to improve a playing field, if the council turned down a Co-op
application to build a superstore on it.
Councillor Angus Graham attacked the offer as an ''inducement''
designed to frustrate the plans of a rival, and said Safeway should
consider offering that kind of assistance for community facilities
anyway, given the profits it made in the islands.
As reported in The Herald at the weekend, Safeway has stated that
there was nothing improper about the offer contained in the letter which
Councillor Graham has now made public.
Safeway, which owns two stores operating under the name of Presto in
Stornoway, was one of the objectors to the Co-op's plan to build a #5m
superstore on the town's Macaulay Road playing field.
The letter, sent by Safeway's regional development director to the
council's chief executive, stated: ''Should your council decide to turn
the Co-op's application down, then Presto would be willing to develop an
all-weather playing surface on the park, suitable for sports such as
football, hockey, etc.
''We have priced the provision of such a facility at #375,000,
inclusive of fees, and would be willing to make this available to the
council for this purpose, should the Co-op's application be refused.''
Mr Graham said yesterday: ''I can only reinforce the fact that the
council is appalled at these actions by a large public company, where it
appears that an inducement was being offered to the council to frustrate
the planning application by one of their competitors.''
Planning permission has been granted to the Co-op, which already has
two stores in Stornoway. It has agreed to pay #1m to provide an
all-weather sports field elsewhere in the town and to help pay for a new
library.
Mr Graham said that Safeway's offer had been received before the
application being determined. Although councillors had been informed of
the offer, it had not been formally put to the council for
consideration.
He said that the council's chief executive had written to Safeway's
chief executive to condemn the company's action.
In addition, Mr Graham has expressed his ''indignation'' in a letter
to Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of the Argyll Group, which owns Safeway.
He told Sir Alistair: ''I must say that at first sight I was quite
frankly appalled at the suggestion contained in the letter, and very
seriously concerned at what appeared to me to be a quite improper
approach to an officer of this council.
''In my view, the letter could easily have been construed as seeking
to interfere, in a wholly unacceptable manner, in the council's proper
consideration of a planning application, submitted by one of your
trading competitors. Quite correctly, the chief executive did not
progress the request from your regional developoment officer.
''However, on reflection, I now realise that there is an alternative
and much more favourable explanation for the letter. It could, in fact,
be regarded as a generous offer of assistance from your company towards
the provison of recreational facilities in the Western Isles.
''Although alternative finance has been found for the sports facility
referred to in the letter, there are still a number of planned social
and recreational facilities which would benefit immensely from private
sector finance, and I would be happy to meet you or representatives of
your company at any time to discuss such assistance.''

<HEADLINE>New hospital guidelines stress need for security</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>977436918</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NEW security guidelines for hospitals were issued yesterday
emphasising the need for tighter controls over access and adequate staff
training.
The guidance from the National Association of Health Authorities and
Trusts (Nahat) said that, in NHS premises with multiple entrances,
''consideration should be given to restricting access via certain points
at certain times''.
This may involve converting some entrances to fire doors, locking
non-essential doors between 6pm and 7am, and fitting window locks.
The guidance, published as a supplement to the existing security
manual, comes amid growing concern over lack of security at hospitals.
Last month, a 32-year-old nurse died after being stabbed in a crowded
hospital ward at Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow.
Earlier this month, it was reported that the Royal Devon and Exeter
Health Care Trust was to pay #60,000 for a police station in its
premises. The hospital had been plagued by theft, vandalism, and
violence.
Fears have also been aroused by a series of much-publicised baby
abductions.
Publication of the new guidance coincided with a conference on health
service security in London attended by trust managers and experts.
The association has also produced a new survey of maternity units in
England and Wales which shows that 16% have installed baby-tagging.
Ninewells Hospital in Dundee will become the latest Scottish hospital
to fit electronic tags to babies in its maternity unit.
Many hospitals have installed security cameras and the tags being
introduced at Ninewells will complement closed-circuit cameras already
installed at the hospital, as well as other security arrangements
introduced in consultation with the police.
Law hospital in Carluke was the first in Scotland to introduce baby
tagging and the Simpson Memorial in Edinburgh followed this up with a
pilot study.
The Vale of Leven maternity unit has recently introduced tagging.
Opening the London conference, junior Health Minister Tom Sackville
said he strongly supported the use of identification badge systems.
He cited York Health Services Trust as a hospital unit where access
security had been greatly improved.
The hospital would soon have only two entrances open during the
evening and at night, including accident and emergency, from an original
total of more than 70. It was also introducing access control by
magnetic strip on ID cards.
However, commenting on maternity units, Mr Sackville warned that a
''quick fix'' of expensive technology was not always the answer.
He said: ''An overall strategy is required. This might include CCTV or
tagging, but will certainly include the close involvement and education
of parents and sound ID syystems for maternity unit staff.''
The NHS executive is setting up a working party, the NHS security
policy group, to examine hospital security.
Mr Sackville said: ''The NHS needs to strike a balance between
creating a fortress-like environment and the need to maintain the open
and welcoming atmosphere that has become the hallmark of the NHS in
recent years.
''Security problems vary enormously, from inner city locations beset
by drug addicts and drunks, to units in more rural or suburban areas
which are not only smaller and easier to police, but have a lower level
of risk.
''We must not over-react but encourage hospitals to provide security
appropriate to their circumstances.''

<HEADLINE>BBC unveils #174m autumn schedule in battle for ratings</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977436919</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE BBC yesterday unveiled a #174m drama package -- including films
with a barrage of four-letter words -- in its autumn schedule aimed at
enticing viewers from ITV, which yesterday announced its #200m package.
Among the films, which will be shown after the 9pm ''watershed'', is
Go Now, with Robert Carlyle and Juliet Aubrey, about an amateur
footballer with multiple sclerosis, who screams his anger at team mates.
The corporation's star-studded line-up includes Stephanie Beacham,
Kenneth Branagh, Julie Christie, Albert Finney, David Suchet, and Peter
O'Toole.
There are seven new series and new dramas, including Patricia
''Hyacinth Bucket'' Routledge as a private eye, in Hetty Wainthropp
Investigates, and Lovejoy star Ian McShane appears as a Liverpool disc
jockey who goes to America in search of his musical heroes in Soul
Survivors.
Mr Charles Denton, head of BBC TV drama, said: ''The renaissance in
popular drama for BBC1 is tangible, and we are now building on that
success.
''The BBC's commitment to classic and contemporary serials, single
films, and studio drama, plus our investment in feature films for the
cinema, is unique.''
Among new serials, Birds of a Feather star Pauline Quirke plays a
murderess in The Sculptress, and there is a farewell to scheming
politician Francis Urquhart in Andrew Davies's The Final Cut.
There will also be the final works of the late Dennis Potter, with
Karaoke and Cold Lazarus, which he completed only days before he died
from cancer, and which are also to be shown on Channel 4.
He refused medication so he could complete the two dramas about a
writer whose creations come to life -- including an appearance by the
writer himself -- and they are almost certain to be in line for British
TV awards.
Favourites such as Hamish Macbeth, Cardiac Arrest, The Vet, and
Dangerfield -- plus a 10th anniversary season of Casualty -- will also
be back.
Meanwhile, BBC executive James Moir, who signed up a string of stars
including Terry Wogan and Noel Edmonds for TV, was appointed as Radio 2
controller yesterday. He will takes over from Ms Frances Line when she
retires in the new year.
Mr Moir, currently deputy director of corporate affairs at the
corporation, was a former head of the BBC's light entertainment group,
he introduced French and Saunders, Ben Elton, Alexei Sayle, and Fry and
Laurie to viewers, and also secured Les Dawson, Bob Monkhouse, and
Jasper Carrott for the BBC.
He also commissioned hit TV series Absolutely Fabulous, the Man From
Auntie, and KYTV.
* Comedian Billy Connolly's tour of Scotland attracted more complaints
from viewers than any other series broadcast last year, the Broadcasting
Standards Council's annual report revealed yesterday.
The report also showed that the number of complaints about programmes
in general had soared, with bad language being the main cause of
offence.
The Big Yin's World Tour of Scotland, which included clips from his
stage shows, attracted 35 complaints from viewers.
A spokesman for the council said yesterday: ''Viewers tuned in to
Billy Connolly's programme expecting to see a travel show about
Scotland. But many got a shock when the cameras switched to his stage
show. They obviously found his stage act offensive, despite the
programme going out late at night.''
Lady Howe, chairman of the council, warned programme makers to tone
down the use of four-letter words and advised them to look to America,
where there was very little offensive language on TV.

A CONSCIENCE-stricken bank robber was yesterday put on probation for
two years when he appeared for sentence at the High Court in Glasgow.
James Johnston, 43, of Fyvie Avenue, Mansewood, Glasgow, spent the
#1800 he stole from the Bank of Scotland before telephoning police to
confess.
However, a police officer told him: ''You must be joking,'' before
hanging up.
Johnston had to telephone back before the police took the call
seriously and arrested him.
He admitted, at an earlier court appearance, robbing the bank in
Battlefield Road, Glasgow, two years ago and pretending to have a
firearm.
Temporary Judge Gerald Gordon, QC, also ordered Johnston to undergo
residential treatment for alcoholism.

POLICE in Fife yesterday criticised thieves who desecrated a war
memorial, stealing a statue commemorating the dead of the First World
War.
A senior spokesman said that feelings were running high in the village
of East Wemyss. Relatives of those who were killed in action still live
in the close-knit former mining community.
A total of 80 names were on a concrete plinth below a metal statue of
a soldier in full battle dress. It was stolen between Saturday night and
Sunday morning.
Police believe it was dragged through a nearby churchyard and
transferred to a van parked in the area.
Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen suspicious activity
to contact them.
Yesterday, police carried out door-to-door inquiries and called in a
dog handler to search the area.
Calls were also being made to antique dealers and scrap metal
merchants in the area in an effort to trace the statue.
The police spokesman said it was likely a van had been used in the
theft but that it was probably parked some distance from the site in an
effort to avoid suspicion.
He added: ''Feelings are running high in the village because of what
the statue represented.
''It was an unwarranted desecration and our inquiries are
continuing.''
Maintenance of statues and memorials in the area is the responsibility
of Kirkcaldy District Council.
A spokesman added: ''We are very concerned and disappointed over this
incident and hope anyone with information will pass it to police.''

SIR Nicholas Fairbairn secretly arranged financial security for his
three daughters, despite his death-bed decision to cut them out of part
of his will, Dr Lorraine Inglis, a close friend and witness, has
claimed.
The former Tory MP, she says, was also in sound mind when he decided
to alter his legacy less than 24 hours before his death on February 19
this year.
In an interview with The Herald yesterday, Dr Inglis provided a
fascinating insight into Sir Nicholas's last hours and the sad torment
of his widow, Lady Sam, 53.
The Perth and Kinross MP cancelled individual legacies of #10,000 to
his daughters, Charlotte, Anna-Karina and Francesca, the day before he
died, and left his entire estate at Fordell Castle, near Dunfermline,
valued at #408,000, to his second wife, Suzanne, known as Lady Sam.
The girls are Sir Nicholas's only children from his first marriage to
the Hon Elizabeth Mackay, daughter of Lord Reay -- although it was
recently revealed that he also has an illegitimate son, who now lives in
Australia.
Now they are contesting the validity of the will, with one daughter
claiming their father might have been hurried into a decision and that
the amendment might not have been witnessed contemporaneously.
Under a will made in 1984 -- the year after Sir Nicholas married for
the second time -- the three girls had been the sole beneficiaries.
In August 1993, however, Sir Nicholas decided to bequeath his estate
to Lady Sam, apart from #10,000 and various paintings for each of his
daughters, and #5000 for Mr Andrew Fenton, then his gardener.
Mr Fenton subsequently left his job and, in September last year, Sir
Nicholas revoked the gardener's legacy.
The death-bed changes were made when the 61-year-old former Solicitor
General for Scotland signed a hand-written codicil or amendment,
sometime on February 18, drawn up by Mr Keith Bovey, the family
solicitor.
Eldest daughter Charlotte, 31, who is married to composer Ross Pople,
said: ''I am not suggesting there was anything improper. But it seemed
to me that the codicil was drawn up in a rather over-hasty way.''
She also remains puzzled why one of her father's last actions was to
cut his three daughters out of his will and whether this occurred while
he was in the throes of dying.
Mrs Pople is taking legal advice because she says she is uncertain
whether Sir Nicholas's gardener, Mr Peter Rozanski, and close friend Dr
Inglis -- the only witnesses to the documentary change -- saw her father
sign the will.
Mr Rozanski -- who is still employed by Lady Sam -- refuses to comment
on his involvement.
However, Dr Inglis says that the alteration to the will was made early
in the day when Sir Nicholas was alert and in reasonable health. She
also claims that Sir Nicholas ensured secure financial provision for
each of his daughters.
''He didn't cut the girls out,'' she asserted, ''Even though it says
that the #10,000 has been revoked, there is no question of the girls
getting nothing, because I have heard the details.
''But that is not to say they yet know all those details,'' she added,
hinting that Sir Nicholas had already provided for his daughters in
other ways to avoid death duties.
''I witnessed the codicil the day before he died,'' she affirmed.
''And I asked him if what he was going to sign was his wish. He said it
was.
''I handed him the pen, which was given to me by the lawyer, and
watched him signed FoF, for Fairbairn of Fordell, and then I signed --
to suggest it happened in any other way is nonsense.''
Dr Inglis also gave an insight into Sir Nicholas' condition. ''I admit
the man was in poor health, but the haemorrhaging, of which he
ultimately died, had not taken place when the codicil was signed earlier
in the day.
''I even took his pulse and it was strong, and he was clear as a bell
mentally.''
Dr Inglis added that Lady Sam had endured ''a terrible time'' from the
''penny papers'' and revelations over Sir Nicholas's illegitimate son
and the disputed will as well as coping with her own bereavement.
''As for the boy in Australia, that has really upset her. She doesn't
know why he couldn't have told her before he died . . . she would have
understood.''
Solicitor Adrian Ward, who originally represented all three daughters
in the dispute over the MP's will, has severed ties with Mrs Pople and
now acts solely for Francesca and Anna-Karina.
Last night he said: ''My two clients are not party to any dispute, but
are having a discussion over the provisions of the will, which is normal
in circumstances such as these.''

THE troubled East Park Home for infirm children in Glasgow is to
embark on a programme of staff cuts, sources at the home claimed
yesterday.
The home, which sacked its matron in April, is now to shed 10% of its
staff and reduce the number of trained nurses by half, cutting #250,000
from its budget.
Ms Anne Thomson, the Royal College of Nursing's officer for Glasgow,
said: ''We are very concerned at what is going on, both from the staff's
point of view and that of the care of the patients.
''The nursing structure is being removed, and the staff are to be
re-designated as care leaders and care assistants.''
The latest moves follow an internal review of the home's future, which
is thought to be steering towards care in the community. It was carried
out by Dr Kenneth McAlpine, a consultant physician specialising in
geriatric medicine at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley.
There are nearly 40 profoundly-handicapped children at the home, many
of them adolescents.
Mr Tim Huntingford, assistant director of childcare with Strathclyde
Regional Council, said: ''We are involved in discussions with East Park
about its long-term future. No decisions have been reached.''
The Scottish Education Department, which under-writes up to 60% of the
home's running costs, said it had been asked for less this year than
last year.
The home's administrator, Mrs May Henderson, could not be reached for
comment yesterday.

ASTHMA sufferers are being warned to be vigilant over the next few
days as the threat of thunder storms, combined with pollen and other air
pollutants, pose an increased threat to people with breathing
difficulties. Last year, a single thunderstorm after a period of hot
weather caused Britain's worst asthma outbreak.

ADVOCATE Keith Henderson, 49, of Brae of Monzie, Crieff, was fined
#125 at Perth Sheriff Court yesterday after admitting using a car
without insurance cover.
The offence, committed on March 11, was said to have arisen as a
result of difficulties faced by Henderson and his wife, Rosalind, 44,
when they were awaiting trial on a drugs charge.
Sheriff John McInnes, who pointed out that Henderson had a previous
conviction for a similar offence, endorsed his licence with six penalty
points. The sheriff allowed Henderson, who was not present at the
hearing, to pay the fine at #5 a week.
Defence lawyer Ms Alison McKay said Henderson was suspended from the
Bar pending the outcome of the High Court case. She continued: ''He was
eventually acquitted and is now able to return to the Bar but, to date,
has not obtained any instructions.
''The insurance offence occurred during his suspension when he was
using his wife's car.
''Due to financial matters, he had decided not to retain his own
vehicle. His wife had not renewed her insurance and that can be put
down, basically, to the fact that she had other matters on her mind. She
was subsequently sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment.
''Mr Henderson simply did not take steps to ensure a policy was in
force for her car. He apologises to the court for this. He has three
children and the family is in receipt of income support of #120 a
week.''

LOCAL authorities have called for an unequivocal commitment from the
Government that rail services in Scotland will continue at the present
level if privatisation goes ahead, and more support for the Fort William
sleeper.
The demand from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities came in
its submission on the draft Passenger Service Requirements (PSR) for
ScotRail and the InterCity east coast franchises.
Its roads and transportation convener, Councillor Walter MacLellan,
said: ''Councils throughout Scotland would view any loss of service
resulting from privatisation, to which we remain firmly opposed, as just
the thin end of the wedge which will see more and more services being
discontinued and eventually closure of railways in Scotland.''
Mr MacLellan stressed that rail services in many parts of Scotland
were a social and economic necessity.
The 154-page submission cites the most significant omissions from the
draft PSRs as the sleeper and Motorail services and the summer
strengthening of services on the West Highland and northern lines.
It says there is sufficient evidence, including three independent
studies, that the Fort William sleeper can be made ''much less
uneconomic'' than the franchising director described it.
The submission on the consultation led by the Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising (Opraf) says the Scotland-West Country (Plymouth) sleeper
service also shows a loss per passenger which is not out of the ordinary
compared with services due to be retained and claims its retention is
essential.
Mr MacLellan also said he doubted whether the sell-off would go ahead
as planned.
Scottish Labour transport spokesman John McFall also responded to the
consultation documents yesterday and demanded Opraf stick to the
Government's promise that the 1993/94 passenger service timetable would
remain in full.
He warned of the danger to the Inverness-Thurso/Wick services.
* The Scottish Chambers of Commerce called for a new single authority
to be set up to co-ordinate and orchestrate Scottish transport policy.

A FURTHER threat of strike action by rail workers in Scotland over a
ban on male staff wearing earrings has been lifted.
A spokesman for ScotRail said yesterday: ''Our policy now is that male
members of staff may wear up to one earring no bigger than 25
millimetres in diameter in each ear, the same as women.
''This underlines our commitment to being an equal opportunities
employer.''
The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said disciplinary
proceedings against four railmen from Yoker depot in Glasgow, who
refused to remove their earrings, had now been dropped, effectively
ending a strike threat by the union, which represents 75% of the 4200
ScotRail workforce.
RMT spokesman Jim McGarry said: ''All the disciplinary charge sheets
have been unequivocally withdrawn. There is no question of discipline.
''ScotRail are now being more fashion conscious, allowing male staff
to wear earrings.''
However, Mr McGarry said there was a need for further talks over other
elements of the new, dress code, introduced last year.
''We now need to develop mechanisms to have an in-depth discussion
with them. Certain elements in the dress code still give us cause for
concern,'' he said.
The code lays down strict guidelines on matters such as hair styles,
tattoos, and jewellery.

THE prospect of a long hot summer of travel chaos grew stronger last
night as British Airways workers threatened to strike.
Meanwhile, talks aimed at averting this Friday's planned rail stoppage
were continued until today.
The discussions between British Rail and the train drivers' union
Aslef broke up last night as BR announced it would impose a 3% pay
increase on other workers, members of the RMT union, who voted by a
majority to reject strike action.
The rise will be awarded to 64,000 out of 77,000 staff involved in the
1995 general pay claim and will be backdated to April 3.
Train drivers and workers in Railfreight Distribution, Rail Express
systems and British Rail Telecommunications, who voted to support strike
action, will not receive the rise.
Earlier this year, all the staff rejected a 3% pay rise -- less than
the current inflation rate of 3.3%.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's board member for personnel, said yesterday:
''A majority of RMT members wisely rejected strike action, and I am
taking their decision as an acceptance of the offer.''
The move was dismissed as ''intimidation'' by an Aslef spokesman last
night.
However, he added that the ''exploratory'' peace talks with BR, which
will continue in London today, were a sign of Aslef's determination to
reach some sort of agreement.
British Airways flights face possible widespread disruption from
August 28, a bank holiday in England and Wales.
A long-running row over management plans to end centralised bargaining
for its 50,000 employees culminated in a demonstration at yesterday's
annual general meeting swiftly followed by a strike threat.
The Transport and General Workers' Union, which represents 20,000 BA
staff including cabin crew, ground staff and administrative and clerical
workers, issued seven days' notice of a strike ballot.
TGWU members were very worried that moves by BA to devolve
negotiations down to 22 business units were aimed at diluting their
bargaining strength and undermining their scope for solidarity, he said.
More than 1000 workers protested outside the company's annual meeting
in London's Barbican Centre.
Mr Bob Ayling, BA's managing director, speaking after the three-hour
annual meeting, said a ballot for industrial action would be ''quite
inappropriate'' and that the company had always made it clear the
proposals were up for discussion.
This Friday's planned rail strike co-incides with the start of the
Glasgow Fair Fortnight, and could mean travel chaos for holidaymakers as
well as commuters.
A spokeswoman for the Automobile Association advised people driving to
work to allow more time for their journeys. However, she added that, on
the basis of the experience of last year's railway signal workers'
strikes, she did not envisage major problems for Scottish commuters.
Holidaymakers heading south on motorways would probably find the
routes much busier than normal, she said.
Some bus operators are planning to lay on extra services on Friday,
although they point out that the high holiday demand means it is
difficult to hire extra coaches from other coach companies.
Glasgow Airport is facing its busiest day of the year on Fair Friday,
when it expects to handle about 300 aircraft movements. An airport
spokeswoman said it was possible that the rail strike could mean
domestic flights, to destinations like London and Manchester, would be
busier.
A spokeswoman for British Airways said: ''From our experience with
industrial action on the railways last summer, we found that the main
focus of additional traffic was Manchester airport, although Glasgow and
Edinburgh did have some increase.
''Rather than put on additional flights, we will wherever possible put
on larger aircraft.''

SCOTTISH education is under threat as never before due to reduced
Government funding, it was claimed during a Heriot-Watt graduation
ceremony in Edinburgh yesterday.
The stinging criticism was levelled by Professor Alistair Rowan,
Principal of Edinburgh College of Art, who was addressing the ceremony
where students of the faculties of economic and social studies, along
with environmental studies, were presented for their degrees.
Professor Rowan accused the Government of ''wanting to have its cake
and eat it,'' by putting more students into the system, yet reducing
funding.
He said money had been taken away year by year since funding councils
were set up, conceding that the Government would claim that more
resources were being spent on higher education than ever before.
He explained: ''This is true but it is one of those limited truths,
which is intended to be misleading.
''In reality, the unit of resource -- the money which each university
gets per student -- is being driven down and down.''
He said money was being taken from the teaching and administrative
staff, imposing pay settlements where salary levels failed to keep pace
with inflation.
''Worst of all, money has been taken from our students, whose level of
grant has been frozen since this Prime Minister came to power. In
1990/91, the student grant was #2265. Five years later, there has been
no increase -- in fact, the grant has been reduced to #2200,'' he said.
In his own sphere, Professor Rowan pointed out that students of art
faced additional problems due to the cost of materials, for example in
silversmithing and jewellery, where rare metals were required.
A student's bill, he asserted, could easily run to #1000 each year, a
level of expenditure far beyond what students in traditional academic
subjects had to meet.
Professor Rowan added: ''To many, this Government seems unconcerned
about the pain it causes, for higher education is not currently its
fashionable cause -- nursery schooling and #1000 vouchers for each
four-year-old child are thought to have more appeal in electoral terms.
''We all know the visual impact of the tear-stained face of a child
but I would put beside this the enormous financial strain which is being
placed on many of our students.''
Referring to the Government's access fund for students in financial
hardship at his college, he said that, five years ago, the fund stood at
#50,229, while today, it was no more than #36,326.
''The fund is administered from my office and I have to tell you that
I have seen the tear-stained faces of men and women in their mid
twenties and thirties who have been denied the level of support which
they required, and on which they were counting,'' he said.
He also questioned the reasoning of students being forced to attend
classes, tired and not fully alert through late night working, because
they had to take part-time jobs in pubs and petrol stations.
''It seems to me a poor policy to treat intelligent and hard working
people in this way,'' he said.
* Writer Dame Muriel Spark was presented with an honorary doctorate
degree in recognition of her international standing. Students Philip
Hall and Michael Spurgin received double degrees, the first to be
awarded by the university, having completed a French business degree in
Strasbourg, alongside their Scottish degree in management studies.

AN artist once christened the ''high priestess of the grotesque in
British art'' walked free from court yesterday after a sheriff heard how
she had assaulted her elderly mother with a pair of scissors.
Patricia Douthwaite, 60, was admonished when she appeared for sentence
at Paisley Sheriff Court.
Described in court as an eminent figure in the Scottish arts world,
she had sentence deferred one year ago to be of good behaviour, after
she admitted assaulting her 94-year-old mother, Winifred, by seizing her
throat and pressing a pair of scissors against her neck.
When Douthwaite appeared yesterday, defence agent Willie Mackay urged
the Sheriff Ronald Smith to be lenient with his client.
Outlining the background to the offence, he said the incident occurred
in the home she shared with her mother at Greenlaw Drive, Whitehaugh,
Paisley, in February last year and amounted to a ''cry for help''.
The lawyer said the elderly woman was a difficult individual to live
with, and was treating her daughter as ''a skivvy''.
On the day in question, the artist lost her temper when her mother
complained that her meal was late.
''All she intended to do was frighten her mother as she felt she
should be appreciated a bit more,'' he added.
It was stated that Douthwaite had now moved to live in Berwick and,
although her mother was being cared for in a nursing home, they still
saw each other regularly.
Douthwaite has had a controversial career, which in the mid-1970s led
to her being crowned the ''high priestess of the grotesque in British
art''.
Her imagery is often disturbing and drawn from the darker side of
life.
A collection of drawings entitled The Alphabet of Greek Goddesses,
which she completed while living in Majorca with her illustrator husband
Robert Graves, led to her taking a stage production called Ianna to
Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre in 1975.
She once confessed to being fascinated by the lives of America's women
gangsters, and said she would have loved to be one herself as they led
''such marvellous colourful lives''.
Born in Glasgow, she studied mime, movement, and dance with Margaret
Morris, whose husband J D Fergusson encouraged her to paint.
The court heard yesterday that she is working on an exhibition for the
Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh.

RANGERS' owner David Murray yesterday announced a proposed #35m
development which would create 400 jobs in an unemployment blackspot.
Mr Murray has lodged the ambitious plans, which include a
pay-as-you-play golf course backed by Scottish Ryder Cup golfer Sam
Torrance, with Motherwell District Council.
The 320-acre development, called Legbrannoch, is on a site near the
village of Newarthill, near Newhouse, and close to the Mossend freight
terminal.
The plans include a 150 bedroom hotel, a nursing home, a garden
centre, an indoor sports centre, and five-a-side pitches. There would
also be an area for Rangers' youth development teams to train and play.
Significantly, the site is close to important motorway links.
Mr Murray said his plan had been well received by those at the
district council.
He added: ''Sam Torrance is right behind the golf course plan and we
will be calling the course Torrance Park.
''I attended the district council yesterday and was well received. We
hope to get the go-ahead for the project next month.''
Last night, Councillor James Coyle, chairman of Motherwell District
Council's planning committee, confirmed the plan.
A special meeting of his committee had been convened, with Mr Murray
invited to be questioned by councillors about the project.
Although opencast mining is still taking place in an area honeycombed
with old workings, Mr Coyle said he was confident there would be no
construction difficulties as the land would be consolidated.
He added: ''As chairman of planning, I am absolutely delighted for the
Motherwell area.
''Mr Murray was quite specific about the number of jobs which could
ultimately be generated, and that has to be good news.
''I can confirm that the plans will go before full council in August,
for further discussion.''

A MAJOR investigation was under way last night after a train smashed
through buffers, over a platform, and into a row of shops yesterday,
injuring five people. It is thought the brakes on the Glasgow to Largs
train may have failed.
Investigators from Railtrack, ScotRail, and the British Transport
Police spent the day at the crash scene trying to establish why the
6.15am Glasgow to Largs train failed to slow down as it entered the
small seaside town station with around 12 passengers on board.
It emerged that the 200-tonne train had been travelling at around
20mph when it crashed through buffers near the end of the track. It then
smashed through a brick wall, slewed across a platform, clipping the
station ticket office, before ploughing into a row of shops next to the
station entrance.
One shop was demolished and another partially destroyed, leaving the
crushed front carriage of the train clearly visible from the town's main
street.
The accident, which police said could have been a disaster if it had
happened an hour later when the station and nearby shops were busy,
prompted widespread calls for an inquiry into rail safety.
Five people, including the train driver, Mr David Robertson, 30, from
Grangemouth, and the guard, Mr James Tarres, 29, from Glasgow, were
taken to Inverclyde hospital. Mr Robertson, who had to be cut free from
the train, has head and neck injuries and Mr Tarres has abdominal
injuries. Both men were detained in hospital for observation.
The three others treated for shock were passengers Mrs Fay Wallace,
45, from Ardrossan, and Ms Alison Harkness, 20, from Saltcoats, as well
as Ms Kathryn Carrol, 26, from Kilmarnock, who was on another train
sitting in the station.
Describing the passengers' escape as a miracle, Mrs Wallace told how
the train brakes seemed to be shuddering and hissing at stops before
Largs. As the train approached Largs, it did not slow down.
''The ticket collector came rushing in, his face looked white and he
was shouting something. It just happened right there and then. Nobody
had time to panic, it was just silent. I could feel the train hit the
buffers and I saw bricks and wood and glass and everything was falling
around us,'' Mrs Wallace said.
Another passenger, construction worker Richard Paterson, 18, from
Stevenston and his friend Craig Ellingham, 18, were sitting in a middle
carriage when the train went through Fairlie. He claimed the Largs stop
was not announced and no warning was given to passengers.
''The train slowed down a bit, then we got flung forward and the
windows smashed in. Once the train had stopped, we went back through to
the next carriage and got out the doors which were lying open. I saw my
life flashing before my eyes. I was very scared, it all happened so
fast.''
The two construction workers were among a group of workmen on the
train who left after escaping through the rear carriages of the train
but whom ScotRail are anxious to talk to about the accident.
Railtrack's production manager Chris Dickson said the investigation,
carried out with independent rail company, Engineering Link from Derby,
would centre on the driver's brake-handling technique, the braking
system, and the signalling system approaching Largs. He said the
six-carriage train had travelled 125ft after hitting the buffers, the
momentum driving it through the shops.
''There is an emergency braking system on the train which comes into
operation when the driver leaves his cabin. Part of the investigation
will look at that system. The information we have is that, realising the
train wouldn't stop, the driver went back towards the passenger
department and was in the connecting vestibule when the train hit the
buffers.''
There was some speculation that the train had failed to stop at the
unmanned stations of West Kilbride and Fairlie, the two stops before
Largs, but this was denied by both Scotrail and Strathclyde police.
ScotRail's director, Mr John Ellis, said it was far too early to
speculate on the reasons for the accident, only adding that the
investigation would be thorough and take some time. ''I can, however,
say that our initial inquiries tell us the train made all 12 of its
timetabled stops before reaching Largs. Rumours that it ran through
stations before it reached Largs are entirely unfounded.''
The crash was also witnessed by passengers on a Glasgow bus parked
outside the station. One told how people queuing for the bus normally
waited in front of the demolished shop.
Newsagent Alistair Still, 38, said he had been serving customers in
his shop beside the station entrance when he had heard what he thought
was thunder. He phone the fire brigade thinking the bus had crashed.
''It was damn lucky no-one was killed. There are usually people in the
station waiting for the Glasgow train.''
Other shop workers told how they had felt vibrations and heard a loud
bang. Bakery worker Andrew Anderson, 20, from Largs, rushed into the
street, but said the emergency services arrived within minutes.
The crash prompted calls for an inquiry into rail safety from the
Labour MP for Cunninghame North, Mr Brian Wilson: ''This is an
astonishing accident and it is a miracle nobody has been killed. As
anyone who knows Largs will appreciate, if this had happened an hour
later, there would have been mayhem.''
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said he was to launch an
investigation after fears about safety and rail privatisation were
voiced by Strathclyde West Euro MP Hugh McMahon shortly after the crash.
Meanwhile, in Liverpool, five people were taken to hospital after the
7.20am Wigan to Liverpool commuter train hit buffers at Lime Street
Station.
A rail spokesman said the fact the 158 train was packed with
passengers waiting to disembark would have helped cushion the effects of
the low-speed impact. The train was not derailed.
The five casualties taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital were
suffering from shock but had no apparent physical injuries.
However, a British Transport Police spokeswoman said some of those
involved were thought to have minor whiplash-type injuries.
A technical investigation was being carried out.
The ticket collector came rushing in, his face looked white and he was
shouting something. It just happened right there and then. Nobody had
time to panic, it was just silent

LOTTERY multi-millionaire Terry Benson yesterday appealed to burglars
to return jewellery, stolen from his home while his family was picking
up their #20m winnings.
Mr Benson, 61, said thieves had taken items of great sentimental value
belonging to his wife Brenda, 56, and he was prepared to pay a reward to
get them back.
The jewellery was grabbed from the home they have shared for 34 years.
Thieves got into the terraced home in Valentine Close on the
Boothferry Estate in Hull and gave it ''an untidy search'', according to
detectives.
The family were in London after a news conference to announce their
win.
Mr Benson said: ''I cannot say exactly how much yet but I will offer a
substantial reward for the pearl necklace I bought Brenda for our 30th
wedding anniversary.
''And even more sentimental than that is her late mother Molly's
watchstrap that Brenda had turned into an identity bracelet.''
Mrs Benson said: ''This has certainly knocked the gilt off the
gingerbread.''
Mr Benson added: ''These people are just low-life. I would call them
animals but animals are better than that. Animals are nice.
''The burglary could have happened any time to anyone -- rich and poor
-- but to come back to this is just horrendous.''
Camelot public relations officers said, following complaints about
lack of security being provided for the Bensons, the company would be
looking into the possibility of providing it for future winners.
Meanwhile, a couple who split up after a row over which of them was
entitled to a #50,000 lottery scratchcard win settled their legal battle
out of court yesterday.
However, although Ms Carole Cartman and her former boyfriend Stefan
Broniewski will get a share of the money, they are both facing
four-figure legal fees.
Ms Cartman, a mother of five, refused to share her win with Mr
Broniewski, saying she had bought the ticket with her own money.
He said he had given her the money to buy it and was entitled to half
of the winnings.
They decided on legal action to settle ownership of the money -- but
yesterday Ms Cartman, 34, of Mapperley, Nottingham, agreed to pay him
#13,000.
She began the action against Mr Broniewski, a Nottingham pawnbroker,
to obtain court backing for her claim that the money was hers.

A DOCTOR was in a coma in a French hospital last night after a road
accident which killed her husband.
Their children emerged unscathed from the wreckage of the family car
after it was in collision with a lorry.
Dr James Smith, 41, died in the crash, near the town of Chateau
Renault, on Monday. The family were on a touring holiday in North-west
France.
His wife, Dr Fiona Smith, was seriously injured in the collision and
was on a life-support machine yesterday.
The Dundee couple's children, Kevin, seven, Fenola, 12, andDominic,
14, were trapped in the wreckage for two hours.
Family members travelled to France yesterday to be with the children,
who were being looked after at the British Consul at Tours.
Dr James Smith practised at the Hawkhill Medical Centre in Dundee,
where staff were devastated by news of his death.
Mrs Elaine Hendry, practice manager, said: ''The staff are very upset,
we have been going around in a daze.''
Dr Fiona Smith practises in Muirhead and Invergowrie, near Dundee.
Meanwhile, in Ayrshire, a mother was killed in front of her two sons.
Mrs Caron Gourlay, 37, of Blair Road, Dalry, and her sons, aged 13 and
11, were travelling through Seamill yesterday when their car was in
collision with an articulated lorry.
The accident happened just before lunchtime on the busy Greenock to
Ayr road. Their Citroen car was extensively damaged.
The boys were taken to Crosshouse hospital, near Kilmarnock, where
their conditions were described as comfortable last night.
In another accident yesterday, Quinton Benzie, 16, of Bryce Avenue,
Lugar, Ayrshire, died after the motorcycle he was riding hit a fence
near Lugar football ground.

CONFIDENCE in the future of crofting is growing, according to the 1994
report from the Crofters Commission.
Crofters have invested an estimated #7.5m in croft land, buildings,
and livestock, and attracted a further #5.5m in grant support in the
past year.
The Croft Entrant Schemes, administered by local enterprise companies
(lecs) and the commission, have meant that 44 new crofters have been
able to take over unused, or underused land.
''This is really a modest scheme but the momentum is going to grow.
Undoubtedly, interest from young people in the area to get into crofts
has grown very significantly,'' Mr Hugh MacLean, commission chairman,
said.
''There is a greater realisation and interest in rural life in all
sectors of the Highland population.
''There is a small percentage who always want to get back to their
roots -- for whom living in a croft and working from a croft is their
ideal -- but there are sufficient people about who want to do that.
However, he said it did not mean they would make a living from the
croft, so there was the other requirement, of the lecs, to make job
opportunities and give assistance.
He added: ''There is a new, and, I believe, justifiable mood of
optimism among crofters, and commission staff have worked with a will to
respond to the changing needs of the crofting communities.
''This success is, in part, due to the introduction of a modern
computer system which has increased efficiency,'' said Mr Maclean.

HOURS after the deadlock at Drumcree was broken, there was little sign
that the hamlet had undergone the most momentous two days of its
200-year history.
Weary women cleaned the church hall where, the night before, more than
10,000 defiant Orangemen had been fed and watered.
The fields surrounding the parish church had been picked clean of
litter, and cattle were already grazing on them again.
The clearest indication, however, of what had gone before could be
seen in the faces and heard in the voices of the volunteers who were
working to bring Drumcree back to normal.
Local Orangeman Mr Jack Mathers said that, in total, more than 30,000
people had been fed from the church hall. ''This was history in the
making.''
Mr Mathers said that people from surrounding towns and villages had
brought mountain loads of food to the hall during the 48 hours of the
stalemate.
''It was unbelievable,'' he said. ''People walked 10 miles to be here,
their cars were parked that far away. They couldn't get here on road
because of the congestion, and they just abandoned their cars and
walked.''
Mrs Rene Donaldson came from nearby Portadown to help out. She said
she had had little sleep during the past two nights. ''The people of
Portadown were fantastic,'' she said. ''People were bringing out bread
and food. Things came in from all over the province. We could have
stayed here indefinitely. As soon as we heard the Orangemen were
staying, we knew the people would have to be fed. I couldn't sleep any
way.''
It was at Drumcree Parish Church, after normal service ended on Sunday
morning, that the Orangemen were told that they could not march along
the Garvaghy Road past the small Catholic community and into Portadown.
Minister John Pickering, 54, took the service as normal, and said
there was little warning that the parade would be stopped.
''The reason was that nobody knew what the situation would be on the
Garvaghy Road,'' he said.
Drumcree Parish Church would seem an unlikely setting for such a large
gathering, surrounded by only four or five houses and set in tranquil
country lanes.
However, around 1000 Orangemen had gathered at the church, with some
overspill into the church hall to hear the service as normal. As word
spread of the deadlock, that number increased tenfold during the next 36
hours. Mr Pickering, not a member of the Orange Order, said he felt
compelled by the circumstances to stay and give what support and help he
could.
He said that, when he left the church, ''around 40 Land Rovers were
blocking the road, parked three across at the head. The Orangemen were
making no attempt to defy the police, they said: 'Okay we're not going
through until you tell us'. They were law abiding. It was the Garvaghy
Road people who were not law abiding. They sat down on the road defying
the law''.
Around half a mile down the road, the feelings in the Catholic enclave
were still running high after the march went through early yesterday
morning.
Mrs Jean Kelly, 63, who lives in Ballyorantark, had been on the road
preparing to block the marchers for two days she said. ''I never left
here except to go to the toilet, I'll never see it again in a
lifetime.'' Mrs Kelly said around 300 protesters had kept a vigil by the
roadside. ''I'm bitterly opposed to these parades coming through here,''
she said. ''Why should they? We had just started to get decent houses in
the town, then they took us and put us out here.''
Mrs Kelly said many people felt they had no alternative, but finally
to allow the Orange parade to proceed. ''When it was explained to us, it
was the lesser of two evils. We were told that, if the parade didn't go
through there were about 20,000 Orangemen in the town, and who knows
what would have happened then.
''They have promised they will not come through tomorrow, and that
that was the last march. I don't know whether to believe that or not,
because they once came matching through here in the middle of the night.
If we had not allowed them to go ahead, then there would have been
riots, and what would they have done if they got into the housing
estate?''

Ron MacKenna sees the dust settle in Portadown, and takes the town's
temperature
ORANGEMEN in full regalia marched into the Northern Irish flashpoint
town of Portadown yesterday after a compromise was reached with the
Nationalist community living along part of the short route.
The agreement, involving concessions from both sides, may have averted
the most serious crisis to hit the Province since the ceasefire was
brokered 10 months ago.
The Orangemen agreed to march without their usual bands and to limit
the parade to local members, around 500. The Nationalist protesters who
had blocked the road during the previous two days agreed to stay silent
as the parade went through.
However, tension still hung over Belfast yesterday as the traditional
celebrations on the eve of the Twelfth, involving street parties and
bonfires, kicked off.
Late last night, urgent talks were taking place between residents and
Orangemen at a second flashpoint, the Nationalist Lower Ormeau Road, in
South Belfast. Residents announced they would demonstrate this morning
to try to prevent an Orange march parading through their area.
The resolution of the Portadown siege, however, brought an almost
immediate end to the blockade of the Larne ferry port. The sympathetic
protests had hit many hundreds of Scots heading for Belfast for today's
marches.
The Portadown protest ended as Orangemen led by Unionist MPs Ian
Paisley and David Trimble walked through Garvaghy Road and into the
town.
The deal, which has involved independent mediators, Dr Paisley, and
residents of the mainly Catholic enclave on Garvaghy Road, was reached
early yesterday morning after a violent outburst among the waiting
Orange supporters.
Mr Brendon McKenna, chairman of the Gavaghy Road residents' group said
that the agreement was a triumph for common sense.
Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew insisted the peace process would
not be affected by the Portadown incident: ''The peace process is
embedded in the hearts of the people. They are not going to let it go.
''I want to see people now being fulfilled in their wish to see their
politicians sitting down round the table and talking through their
political differences.''
Mr Brendan McAllister, director of the independent Mediation Network
for Northern Ireland, said the Orangemen had agreed to stay clear of the
road.
''The local Orangemen honoured their commitment to stage a peaceful
and dignified procession. The residents honoured their commitment to
stage a peaceful and dignified protest and removed themselves
voluntarily from the road in time for the procession to pass. And the
RUC honoured their commitment to police the procession and protest with
due care and sensitivity.''
The Mediation Network uses conciliators from both sides of Ulster's
religious divide. Its efforts were praised by all sides in the dispute.
The two-man conciliation team was led by former probation officer Mr
Brendan McAllister, 38, a Roman Catholic. His network colleague
throughout an intensive 36-hour long spell of shuttle diplomacy, Mr Joe
Campbell, is a member of the Protestant Presbyterian Church.
The mediators were called in on Monday afternoon to deal with a
steadily worsening situation, sparked by the RUC's refusal to permit the
Orange parade to take its planned and possibly inflammatory route
through Garvaghy Road.
The outcome was the most striking success so far for an organisation
established on a strictly independent basis in 1991 by Northern
Ireland's Community Relations Council.
The methods adopted by the network -- drawn in part from training
experience in the United States -- were being studied closely by the
authorities last night to see they could again be used throughout the
Province's highly-sensitive marching season.

TWO major Scottish banks yesterday were in contact with the group of
Tory business leaders who want to take over the Scotsman newspaper with
a view to helping finance the bid.
The Herald can reveal that the banks, believed to be the Royal Bank of
Scotland and the Bank of Scotland, have been in touch with the man
fronting the consortium, Professor Ross Harper.
It emerged last night that Mrs Susan Bell, wife of businessman Arthur
Bell is involved in the bid. Mrs Bell stood as a Tory candidate in the
Monklands by-election last year.
The move by the banks came as journalists at the Scotsman met and
passed a resolution welcoming the possible sale because it gave the
opportunity to secure the independence of the newspaper, and keep future
editorial and managerial control in Scotland.
Professor Harper invited staff at the titles to meet him for talks so
he could assure them the paper would remain independent, and be
Scottish-owned. He also distanced himself from claims that the paper
would be turned into a ''Tory influenced'' paper.
The Scotsman is one of five Scottish titles, currently owned by the
Thomson Corporation, which are up for sale. The others are Scotland On
Sunday and the Evening News in Edinburgh, and the Press and Journal and
Evening Express in Aberdeen. Two weekly free newspapers in Edinburgh and
Aberdeen are also included.
Thomson said last night it already had a number of expressions of
interest for the papers but refused to divulge from whom or say how many
had so far been lodged.
Among the companies being mentioned as potential buyers is the
Falkirk-based Johnston Group, which publishes 82 titles throughout
Scotland and England. A statement issued on behalf of its chairman, Mr
Freddy Johnston, said at this stage no discussion or approach had been
made to management at the Scotsman.
A spokeswoman added: ''For that reason, we are in no position to make
any hypothetical comment.''
Mr David Bell, chief executive of Pearsons, the publishers of the
Financial Times, said his group was ''100%'' not interested.
No-one was available for comment from either United News who publish
papers in England and Wales, or magazine giant EMAP.
Last night, it was beginning to emerge who the other main players in
the Professor Harper consortium takeover bid are. Successful businessman
Bill Hughes of Grampian Holdings, a company with a turnover of #138m,
and Mr Peter De Vink, managing director of Edinburgh Financial and
General Holdings, are both involved. Mrs Susan Bell, who has experience
in direct marketing and advertising said serious business people were
behind the bid.
She said it was ''small-minded political cant'' for people to think
the papers could afford to take a Tory line. Mrs Bell said there was no
place for sentiment in newspapers and it was obvious that they could not
be run without professional journalists and technicians.
Mr De Vink, speaking from his Edinburgh office, said the Scotsman had
suffered from having an ''absentee landlord'' and would flourish under a
resident one.
Professor Harper said not all those involved were Conservatives but
admitted many of them were. He added that talk and insinuation that the
objective was to produce a Scottish Tory freesheet was palpable
nonsense. He encouraged those who criticised the venture to come and
join them.
''That is because a newspaper, especially in this day and age of
rising newsprint prices, must sell to survive, and to sell, it must be
balanced, with clear editorial independence,'' said Professor Harper.
He was supported by Mr Hughes, one of the leading lights in Scottish
industry, whose successful company is involved in road transport,
sporting goods, and veterinary pharmaceuticals.
Mr Hughes, who is treasurer of the Scottish Conservative Party, said
he was ''very supportive'' of what Professor Harper was trying to do. He
said he believed that the money to put together a multi-million pound
bid could be raised in Scotland.
He added that the consortium would certainly not affect the editorial
line of a national quality paper like the Scotsman.
Mr Hughes said: ''Look at your own paper, The Herald. I am sure there
are people on The Herald board with Tory or other political leanings but
that influence does not show through in the paper, and does not affect
The Herald's stance.
''All the board of a newspaper can do is make sure it appoints an
editor to its paper who shows balance.''
However, the promises of non-Tory interference were last night
criticised by leading Scottish political figures.
SNP leader Alex Salmond alleged that the Tories behind the project had
''taken leave of their senses''. He said he would be writing to Thomson
Regional Newspapers on the question of the future of the papers.
Mr Salmond said: ''I will be writing to Thomson's reminding them of
their founder, who made it clear he wanted the Scotsman to be given an
independent editorial line.
''The Scotsman has a long tradition and in recent times a record of
supporting the Scottish cause. It will not be easy to transform it into
a propaganda rag for the Tory party.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson warned against a Tory
takeover of the Scotsman and said it was vital that the interests of the
staff were protected under any change of ownership.

A TRAIN lies amid the debris of Largs station and two shops.
The 6.15am from Glasgow failed to stop at the station yesterday and
crashed through buffers before coming to rest within feet of a busy
street.
Five people were injured, including the driver and the guard, but MP
Brian Wilson said that the toll could have been higher during peak time.
An inquiry into the crash has been launched.

RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin was in hospital last night, after
being struck down by heart pains, but the Kremlin insisted he was still
running the country from his hospital bed.
The 64-year-old leader was said to have made a good recovery and was
not in danger.
He was taken to Moscow's central clinic for tests after a persistent
ischaemic heart condition -- a blood supply problem -- grew worse.
His troubled health has in the past raised doubts about his ability to
rule Russia but, last night, officials played down a new round of
speculation.
They said the president was carrying on work from the hospital ward
and there was no reason for a temporary transfer of power to Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
''The painful attack has been relieved and there is no recurrence of
pain,'' said spokesman Sergei Medvedev, after Yeltsin underwent
electro-cardiograph tests.
A Kremlin statement said he would stay in the clinic under
observation.
''The doctors think there are no grounds to be seriously concerned
over the president's health,'' said Medvedev.
Yeltsin had signed official documents during the day and intended to
go ahead with an official visit to Norway in eight days.
However, opposition party leaders, who have voiced disquiet about
Yeltsin's health and heavy drinking, said he should think again about
running for the presidency in elections due next year.
In Paris, French President Jacques Chirac wished Yeltsin a ''prompt
and full recovery'', while in Washington President Clinton said that,
when he saw Yeltsin in Canada in mid-June, the Russian leader ''was in
good health and seemed to be doing well''.
Yeltsin was elected president in 1991 but his popularity has waned and
he looks a less impressive figure, puffy-faced and walking stiffly.
Bizarre incidents linked with his health and an apparent fondness for
alcohol have dogged him.
He has been under fierce pressure, particularly since he sent troops
to Chechnya last December in a bloody and so far inconclusive attempt to
end the region's bid for independence.

BOSNIAN Serb forces yesterday shrugged off a Nato airstrike and
overran the UN ''safe haven'' of Srebrenica, driving 30,000 Muslim
refugees before them.
Late last night they claimed they were poised to take Zepa, another UN
enclave in the east.
The assaults posed the most serious challenge in three years to the
United Nations' peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and forced Mr Major to
warn that the UN force, including more than 10,000 British troops, may
have to be pulled out.
The Prime Minister's words acknowledged that this was the ultimate
test of the will of the UN by the Bosnian Serbs.
British commandos were put on alert last night for a possible rescue
operation as Bosnian Serb television stated: ''Srebrenica has been
liberated . . . Zepa is expected to do the same tonight.''
It would leave, in Eastern Bosnia, only Gorazde as a UN safe haven for
Muslims.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in an interview, says the
UN effort in Bosnia is ''mission impossible''. He says he personally
opposes withdrawal but can now envisage a time when the international
community could tire and allow Sarajevo to slip into Serb hands.
American Defence Secretary William Perry said: ''This raises the
question as to whether the UN force will be able to stay in Bosnia and
perform their humanitarian mission.''
The Bosnian Government condemned the lateness of the UN response to an
attack which has been building for days.
''They refuse to take measures when they can still have an effect on
events . . . I feel betrayed by those who promised that the Rapid
Reaction Force would bring change,'' Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed
Sacirbey said on a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic also condemned UN inaction.
''They waited actually until the Serb terrorists started entering the
town.''
The Serbs, in defiance of world condemnation, moved to tighten control
over Srebrenica to the extent of appointing a Serb mayor.
The refugees streamed north from stricken Srebrenica behind a screen
of lightly-armed Dutch troops, whose defensive positions had earlier
been overwhelmed by Serb armour and infantry.
Nato warplanes struck yesterday afternoon, destroying two Serb tanks
as a warning against encroachment on Srebrenica, the first of six
enclaves declared as protected ''safe havens'' by the UN in 1993.
The bombing strikes by US and Dutch aircraft followed six days of Serb
shelling of the area, the taking of 30 UN military hostages, a firefight
with Dutch peacekeepers on Monday, and repeated threats of Nato airpower
as a deterrent.
Last night, the vastly outnumbered and outgunned Dutch soldiers were
trying to establish a new blocking position at the main UN area base of
Potocari, about two miles north of Srebrenica.
UN aid spokesman Kris Janowski said: ''What we are now seeing is the
most unfortunate scenario. There is a massive, uncontrolled exodus from
the town. Thousands of those fleeing from the fighting now surround the
UN base.
''They are not hostile. They are just desperate and afraid and fleeing
from the horror behind them. Most are hungry and seeking food, shelter,
and protection.''
Mr Major will assess the situation overnight while the Foreign Office
contacts the French, the Dutch, and other nations with ground forces
involved in the crisis.
He may make a statement to the Commons today. He has a new Foreign
Secretary in Mr Malcolm Rifkind and a new Defence Secretary in Mr
Michael Portillo, both of whom have been highly sceptical about
committing British troops on the ground in the former Yugoslavia.
Yesterday, he told the Commons: ''Unless the warring parties are
prepared soon to indicate that they are prepared to return to some form
of discussion to reach a political settlement, there is no doubt that
continuing fighting would put the continuing presence of the United
Nations at risk.''
At the United Nations, ambassadors are conferring in the face of this
new crisis which has to be faced by withdrawal or some miracle of
eleventh hour diplomacy which will allow the UN force to continue its
so-called humanitarian efforts. This time, it is Dutch troops who have
been taken hostage by the Bosnian Serbs and their future is now in the
balance. Yesterday, Dutch aircraft took part in the air strikes.
On Monday, the Serbs ordered all 42,000 civilian population of the
area to leave by Wednesday or face the consequences. They also told the
400-man Dutch peacekeeping garrison to pull out, leaving its weapons in
Serb hands.
UN response was to send a platoon of 30 Dutch troops to man a tripwire
line outside the town. The token force fought a successful, two-hour gun
battle with Serb infantry on Monday night. The UN warned again that any
further assault would bring down Nato bombing strikes.
The strikes proved futile. In Belgrade, Mr Stephen Oberreit of the
charity Doctors Without Borders said: ''Nobody is left in the town. The
whole population is on the road.''
In Sarajevo, UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gary Coward said: ''It's
looking pretty gloomy.'' Nato commanders said their warplanes were
continuing to hit targets selected by commanders on the ground.
In the Bosnian Serb headquarters of Pale, an adviser to Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic said: ''The Nato policy of bombing is a
counterproductive policy. The international community seems to have
learned nothing from its past mistakes. The more they bomb us the more
entrenched we shall become.''
The Dutch Government had asked the UN to call off a planned third air
strike against Bosnian Serbs attacking Srebrenica for fear of reprisals
against the 30 Dutch hostages.
''I have urged the third wave of airstrikes be cancelled due to the
terroristic threats made by the Bosnian Serbs,'' Defense Minister Joris
Voorhoeve said on Dutch television.
A Defense Ministry spokesman said the Serbs had threatened to kill the
30 Dutch hostages and flatten Dutch compounds in the enclave.
Mr Major and the new French President Jacques Chirac, cannot yet call
on their rapid deployment force for serious action. UN delays in its
deployment have resulted in the arrival of only forward troops. Last
night, it was looking as though the British and French would accelerate
the deployment, if only to provide a fighting force to cover the total
withdrawal of the UN presence.
Mr Chirac said France was prepared to intervene militarily, if asked
by the United Nations, to recapture Srebrenica.
''We have to re-establish a safe zone around Srebrenica,'' he said in
Strasbourg after a meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. ''If we
don't re-establish the enclave of Srebrenica in its entirety, I don't
see what could stop the Serbs from other enclaves and even from
Sarajevo.''
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook described its fall as a ''massive
blow to the credibility and authority'' of the international community.
He called for the deployment of the Rapid Reaction Force to be speeded
up.
The UK last night put 750 Royal Marines on 10-day standby to intervene
in the crisis. A Dutch Marine battalion is also on alert to join 42
Commando, currently based at Bickleigh, Devon, as a floating emergency
reserve in the Adriatic.
The UN's immediate problem is that it has again resorted to token air
strikes to no effect. The town of Srebrenica has fallen and the
populations of the other five ''safe'' enclaves must now be wondering
when their turn will come.
Nato, which earlier this month dusted off and fine-tuned an evacuation
plan for all 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia, now fears that the operation
might turn into a costly rescue mission along mountain roads.
The Bosnian winter begins in earnest in mid-October. Even before then,
the central highlands of the country -- the scene of the heaviest
fighting -- are cloaked in cloud and mist. Despite hi-tech weaponry and
laser guidance, pilots cannot hit what they cannot see, rendering a
protective umbrella of air support virtually useless in bad weather.
Nato officers are also concerned about UN indecision over the command
structure for the operation, codenamed Determined Effort. They insist
that Nato must have clear and unambiguous control of the withdrawal
under an agreed UN Security Council Mandate.
Up to 60,000 Nato soldiers, including 25,000 US troops, would be
needed to secure high ground and key roads and passes to allow the safe
retreat of UN peacekeepers from mountain regions down the two main
routes to the Adriatic coast.

ACTOR Hugh Grant last night pleaded no contest to a charge of lewd
conduct following his arrest last month for having sex with a Hollywood
prostitute.
He was fined $1180 (about #800) and placed on two years' probation, Mr
Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney's office
said.
Grant was not at the hearing, which was brought forward from next
Tuesday at the request of his attorneys, Mr Qualls said.
The Four Weddings and a Funeral star won worldwide attention when Los
Angeles police officers caught him allegedly receiving oral sex from a
prostitute in his parked car.
Grant, 34, faced a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a $1000
fine, although imprisonment was extremely unlikely for a first offender.
His fine included court costs.
One condition of the probation was that Grant complete an Aids
education programme by November 13.
Earlier, Grant displayed the same self-effacing humour and shy stammer
which made him a star, as he charmed millions of Americans while being
interviewed on Monday night for Jay Leno's Tonight Show, on which he
admitted: ''I did a bad thing.''
''What the hell were you thinking?'' asked Leno, and Grant, although
he fidgeted and looked nervous, did not make any excuses.
Looking intensely uncomfortable and sipping constantly from a mug of
water, Grant said he could understand why there was so much interest in
the encounter.
''I can see the juice in it. I can see how, if I hadn't been the
person who perpetrated this whole thing, I suppose I would be enjoying
it as much as anyone else. But it's pretty miserable on the other side
of the equation.''
Grant acknowledged that he deserved some of the flak which had come
his way but regretted the way his family had been exposed to the
attentions of the media as a result of the scandal.
Grant's public admission will help him come to terms with his guilt,
said psychologist Dr Dorothy Rowe.
''I thought it was a very honest thing to say. He is not trying to
make the kind of excuse Michael Douglas uses for his sex addiction, by
saying, 'It's not my fault, it's something in my genes'.
''Grant is saying 'It is my fault, I did wrong'. And that's good
because he is not using psycho-babble as an excuse.''
Publicist Max Clifford thought Grant had acquitted himself well.
''Admitting his mistake was the right thing for him to do and to admit
he enjoys reading about embarrassments, too, shows he is not a
hypocrite.''
Grant has other interviews lined up this week and next, including one
with David Letterman.
