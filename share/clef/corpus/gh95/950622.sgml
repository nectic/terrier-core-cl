Jimmy Reid laughs along with everyone else at the English belief in
their sporting supremacy -- regardless of the results.
THERE are millions throughout the world who snigger into their cups,
or guffaw outrageously, when an English team is torn apart, not to say
blootered, by some baggie minnie of a team.
A couple of years ago I went with some mates to Dublin to support
Scotland in a game at Lansdowne Road. On the Saturday morning we
strolled the sunny streets, stopping here and there for a wee snifter.
Outside a fancy hotel, whose wares we were about to sample, a gracious
lady was selling stickers for a Third World charity. She stuck one on my
lapel and whispered: ''I hope your team wins.''
''You can't mean that,'' I said. ''But I do,'' she insisted. ''We got
the result we wanted two weeks ago.'' Two weeks earlier Ireland had
defeated England in the Five Nations Cup.
Welsh miners make a holiday out of going to Murrayfield but leave the
valleys by coach on the morning of the match at Twickenham. The game
against England is too serious for frivolity. They return after the game
to celebrate or drown their sorrows in their valley strongholds.
I've never been to Twickenham and don't particularly want to go. To
lose down there, to endure the triumphalism at first hand, is too much,
and a disconsolate journey home too awful to contemplate.
If confined to these isles then this anti-Englishness, in matters
sporting, could be explained by the resentments of small nations living
in the same unitary state as a much larger nation, whose culture has a
tendency to overwhelm the cultures of the others.
But France doesn't come into this category, yet for the French to
defeat the English brings a special joie de vivre. It could be that this
is the rivalry of big nations, Napoleon, Wellington, et al.
How then do we explain Australia and New Zealand, or for that matter
India, Pakistan, the West Indies, all from a different hemisphere yet at
rugby or cricket they live to beat England? South Africa is the same.
They wanted England to beat the All Blacks so that they could trounce
England in the final.
It could be argued that these are the resentments of former colonies,
but why is the antipathy getting worse as the empire fades into the
mists of time, and anyway it was the British Empire, not the English
Empire, and neither was a patch on the Glasgow Empire.
It's the same story in football. In 1982 my family decided to holiday
in Spain, and support Scotland in the World Cup. We spent a glorious
evening with some journalist friends in a holiday complex where there
were Brazilian supporters.
That night the Scots and the Brazilians got together for a party.
During a respite, a Brazilian told me that, Latin American rivals apart,
they liked best beating England. But why, I asked, when England was no
longer a major force in World football? Among Europeans, the Italians,
Germans, Dutch, and French were the ones to fear. My friend assured me:
''We don't fear England; we just like beating them.''
Everybody who isn't English likes to see England lose. This is
strange. I lived in England for years and the people were great. The
English village was a classic unit of togetherness.
The Church of England was wonderful, the soft, tolerant underbelly of
Christianity. There was little believers had to believe, and nobody got
steamed up about anything. On the whole they were less inclined to do
bodily damage unto others compared with other believers.
English football fans were also then the greatest. They never argued,
let alone fought. English sporting fans were lauded as the
fairest-minded in the world. So what went wrong?
Britain lost her empire, the English took it badly. Since 1945 Britain
has no longer been a major power but has sought to retain a global
influence by clinging to America's shirt tail and claiming a ''special
relationship'' with Uncle Sam, the new superpower.
This posturing cost us dearly. Britain was derided as America's
poodle.
The Scots had never really aspired to rule the world, one of the good
by-products of being a small nation. Scotland never really had a crisis
of post-colonial identity. But England had, and still has.
The laid-backness of the English stemmed from an innate sense that all
things English were better than all the things of others. They were
better at ruling the world than anyone else. The Americans and Russians
might have the arsenals, England had the know-how.
Then came Suez and the humiliating withdrawal. A cock-up on the grand
scale. It must have been about then that awareness of Britain's reduced
status began trickling down to the English masses.
The response was unexpected. Instead of coming to terms with this new
reality, the English became, over the next two decades, more jingoistic
and more overtly chauvinistic than ever before.
The Falkland's war, fought umpteen-thousand miles away, was conducted
in a blaze of English jingoism. England now had a warrior queen. A
blue-rinsed Boadicea. The most telling piece of film of those years was
of Mrs Thatcher at battle stations in a tank with carefully coiffured
hair, like General Blood 'n' Guts Patton in drag. It was high camp and
should have been laughed to scorn but was taken seriously by the British
media and the English people.
Then came the Union Jack flag-waving, not on British ceremonial
occasions, but as the symbol of England at sporting events, along with
God Save the Queen as the English national anthem. The message was
clear. Surprise, surprise, Great Britain was England.
Chauvinism isn't nationalism. Nationalism asserts a sense of national
identity. Chauvinism asserts a sense of national identity that claims
superiority over others. German fascism was German chauvinism structured
into a political movement.
The English media were talking up their chances prior to the game
against the All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup. At no time had they a
chance of winning.
Afterwards the depth of the problem was revealed by the remarks of the
English captain. Will Carling was graceless in defeat. Jonah Lomu is a
fine natural athlete. Carling called him a freak.
When asked if his late tries were of any value, Carling said: ''It was
good to run past that thing.'' The Daily Telegraph had a full-page
picture of Lomu in full stride with the headline ''Bulldozed by Lomu''.
The caption refers to New Zealand's ''mauling of England''. The Times
called Lomu ''an athletic freak''.
The image created is of an aboriginal neanderthal devoid of skills. A
mindless juggernaut. This was manifestly untrue. Lomu has strength,
pace, balance, and a wee shimmy that enables him to float past
opponents. If Jonah had been white, or English, the words would have
been different. ''Genius'' would have been an odds-on certainty.
A correspondent in the Times praised the All Blacks. ''To have brushed
Ireland, Wales, and Scotland aside was one thing. To do so against the
might of England is the most phenomenal feat of all.'' You see, England
cannot be beaten except by phenomena. All together now, Vive La France.

MARKET forecasters got it wrong again with their projections for the
May non-EU visible trade deficit. This turned out to be much worse than
expected in contrast to the March world figures, released earlier this
month, which were much better than estimated, producing the lowest
monthly trade deficit since June 1991 and, after revisions, the lowest
first-quarter shortfall for eight years.
The non-EU visible shortfall for May emerged at #607m against April's
#516m, itself revised up from #474m. City projections had centred on as
low as #360m.
There was a fall-off in the value of exports from #5266m to #5182m
over the month, while imports were barely changed at #5789m.
The picture, though, becomes much more stark in volume terms. After
stripping out oil -- which showed a surplus -- and erratic items --
defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver -- the volume of
exports fell by 2% compared with April, while import volumes volumes
rose by 5[1/2]%.
Over the three-month period, naturally regarded as a far better
indication of the underlying trend than one month's figures in
isolation, exports rose by 2% and imports by 2[1/2]%.
The Central Statistical Office said the latest trends in volume show
export volume fairly flat and import volume rising. The outcome provoked
some consternation among wrong-footed analysts, though there was little
reaction in financial markets. And exports still stood at a record
#13.6bn in the three months to May, up more than 12% on the same period
last year.
That said, there must be worries that the export momentum is slowing
while imports show no sign of declining, despite exchange rates which
should be making these less competitive, though the fall in the pound
could now be working its way out of the system. The largest increases in
imports were seen in categories such as fuels, food, drink and tobacco,
which may be consistent with restocking.
So far as exports are concerned, analysts suggested the pound's
weakness earlier this year was unlikely to feed through for another six
months, but there is evidence that, although sterling's recent
turbulence should have left exporters potentially more competitive, many
companies would appear to have been raising prices rather than reducing
them.
''The depreciation was largely against EU currencies so the effect
will be small in non-EU data,'' said Adam Cole, UK economist at James
Capel.
The fall in exports over the month was considered not too surprising
in some quarters since growth was slowing in some of Britain's major
non-EU markets such as the US and Japan.
As has already been seen, the market can be well out in its
calculations. Moreover, the figures are often revised, sometimes
substantially as was the case in January and February, throwing out
previous calculations. This can be particularly true when invisible
earnings from City-style services are taken into account.
There have been suggestions that after the first-quarter performance,
the current account, which includes invisibles, could be in surplus this
year. However, it is far too early to speculate on this and the May
non-EU trade performance certainly provides a warning shot against any
complacency.

BIG city health boards in Scotland face further cuts in their share of
the health budget, if a formula now used in England is applied north of
the Border, Greater Glasgow's director ofpublic health warned yesterday.
Dr Harry Burns said he and his colleagues had urged the Scottish
Office not to apply the resource allocation formula here but had heard
nothing to reassure them.
''The effect in England has been to take money out of the inner cities
and redistribute it elsewhere,'' he told yesterday's monthly board
meeting.
''The Home Counties are among the areas which have gained as a
result.''
The health budget is allocated on a per capita basis topped up with an
allowance to reflect higher death rates. This has benefited Glasgow, but
because of the drop in population, millions of pounds have been clawed
back and redistributed to bring the area towards parity with other
health boards through what is known as the Share formula.
The English formula has replaced mortality ratios as a criterion for
increased funding, and Dr Burns said: ''We have no reason to believe
that a review of Share will improve Glasgow's funding in any way.''
Dr Burns' warning came as the board endorsed its long-awaited acute
and maternity services strategy after considering responses to public
consultation.
The original proposal to close two major acute hospitals outright
having been dropped, the most controversial measures agreed yesterday
were the closure of Rutherglen Maternity over the next four to five
years, and the transfer of the Western Infirmary from its current site
in Partick to a #100m development alongside its sister hospital,
Gartnavel General.
The plan to close Rutherglen produced a petition of 62,000 signatures
from campaigners in the south-east of the city who were fighting for a
reprieve. After the meeting, they said they would appeal to the
Secretary of State, who will have the last word.
The plan will leave adult acute services still being provided from
five sites -- the Western-Gartnavel (West Glasgow), the Royal Infirmary,
the Victoria Infirmary, Stobhill Hospital, and the Southern General.
Other realignments planned include the transfer of infectious diseases
services from Ruchill Hospital to a new unit at Gartnavel General, and
of plastic surgery from Canniesburn to the Royal Infirmary.
Maternity services will be on three sites -- a new Royal Maternity
alongside the Royal Infirmary, the Southern General, and the Queen
Mother's at Yorkhill.
Rutherglen will remain operational until the new Royal Maternity is
commissioned, chairman Sir Bob Calderwood made clear yesterday. But the
parade of mothers from Rutherglen who packed the meeting were not
impressed with the reasons for the closure, which included staffing
difficulties.

Tasteful traditions are alive and well in Buchan reports Judy Mackie
ENTERPRISING farmers Simon and Valerie Lister have found a way of
transforming barley into liquid gold -- and it should go down a treat
with real ale enthusiasts throughout Scotland.
Buchan Gold, launched on June 1, is the newest brew on the Scottish
real ale market. But in its smooth, nutty depths lies the taste of
tradition. Brewed the old-fashioned way in a giant copper kettle, in the
heart of North-east arable farmland, the ale has a flavour of romance
which should appeal to the most discerning CAMRA member.
Novice brewers Valerie and Simon, of the 400-acre Mains of Inverebrie,
Ellon, Aberdeenshire, hit on the novel idea of making their own real ale
when Valerie decided to return to work after having two children. The
34-year-old former advertising executive wanted to use her selling and
design skills in a home-based business.
When Real Ale fan Simon (36), suggested that they should make the
giant leap from growing malting barley to sell to breweries to building
a brewery of their own, Valerie's marketing mind went into overdrive and
Buchan Gold was born.
The couple have converted their old barn -- formerly used to house
pigs -- into a compact, stone-and-pine brewery, the centrepiece of which
is the magnificent one-ton copper kettle, hand-crafted by A Forsyth and
Son, of Rothes. An ancient brick chimney near the brewery has been
restored to handle the steam created by the kettle.
The Listers are initially relying on the expertise of a brewing
consultant, who came up with the recipe for Buchan Gold.
''Our ale is a deep gold, with a smooth creamy head, and it's not too
bitter -- the Scots don't like their real ale as bitter as the English
prefer,'' says Valerie, who, like Simon, comes originally from Cornwall.
The couple have been given permission to use the Buchan Coat of Arms,
which graces their brewery's distinctive copper pump clips, designed by
Valerie in the shape of the kettle.
The newly-christened Aberdeenshire Ales brewery -- comprising Simon,
Valerie and a small staff of family members and friends -- is set to
produce 900 gallons of Buchan Gold a week. The ale is being marketed
locally by Valerie and sold throughout Scotland by a North-east brewing
agency.
The Listers are confident their brew will find a comfortable niche in
the real ale market. Valerie explains why: ''There are other real ale
producers in Scotland, but they've been really helpful and there's
plenty of room in the marketplace for all of us. Our particular strength
lies in our traditional brewing methods, which are unique this side of
the border.''

TRAMS are big business in Manchester, with 13-million passengers a
year taking a ride on the city's Metrolink system, Manchester's
state-of-the-art tramway.
But a Scot is the Lancashire city's top tramwayman. John McGuinness,
40, who was born and bred within sight and sound of the former
Dalmarnock Tram Depot, in Glasgow, is operations manager of Metrolink.
He maintains that it takes a Glaswegian to keep the wheels rolling.
''Metrolink opened in July 1992,'' says John. ''It has revolutionised
public transport in Manchester and operates on a mixture of city-centre
street tracks and former railway lines, linking Bury and Altrincham. I'm
proud to be at the controls.''
John served in the engineers in the Army for 12 years before joining
the staff of the then-new Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle.
''It was exciting being in at the start of a new system,'' said John.
''I really learned the light-rail transport business there, and I came
to Manchester in the setting-up phase in 1991 as commercial assistant.
Last year I was promoted to operations manager.''
He keeps track of 110 operating staff, 20 route miles, and 26
high-tech trams, costing #1 million each.
''Tram driving is the core activity of this business,'' he says.
''Everyone, from the managing director down, drives regularly. I enjoy
doing that. It keeps you in touch with the basics of the business.''
Mancunians will also meet the operations manager on revenue protection
duties, for he takes a regular turn at finding the fare dodgers, who pay
an on-the-spot fine of #50 or are prosecuted.
''The Metrolink project is a mixture of public and private funding
providing the finance. Metrolink operates the system on a 15-year
contract. Thanks to our success, west Yorkshire have also built a street
light-rail system, and Croydon is next to get the new tramway tracks.''
But most exciting of all to John is the news that Glasgow's tram is
also getting set to take to the streets once again.
''I'm delighted to hear that plans are well advanced in Glasgow. I
feel that there are great similarities between Manchester and Glasgow.
Both were famous for operating old-style tramway systems in the past,
and both share Victorian architecture and a similar history of heavy
industry.
''Mancunians have welcomed the trams back with open arms. I'm quite
certain that the same will happen in Glasgow. I wouldn't rule out
changing trams when the Glasgow cars make their comeback. Getting behind
the controls of a Glasgow tram would be just the ticket for me,'' says
John.

Aileen Little hears that maximising potential is one chieftain's war
cry in business
FOR 900 years, Carmichaels have lived on lands in the upper ward of
Lanarkshire. But apart from involvement in the Darien Scheme, there has
been scant history of business ventures -- until now.
The family motto of Richard, 26th Baron and 30th Chief of the Clan
Carmichael is Tout Jour Prest (Always Ready) and demonstrably he is
living up to the dictum. Since claiming his inheritance 15 years ago, he
has brought his original 2300 acres from ''marginally viable'' estate
(according to his predecessor's trustee) to fully maximised,
multi-purpose concern.
''As an accountant, I took a view of the situation and donated 500
acres to a family trust that will benefit Carmichaels in generations to
come,'' he says.
From the age of 16, Carmichael knew that, in the absence of a direct
heir, he would one day assume the chieftan's mantle. With this in mind,
he qualified as an accountant. ''It allowed me an internationally
recognised passport to travel and employment,'' he explains.
He journeyed to Tanzania and settled with his wife in New Zealand
where he was audit manager in the country's largest export port.
Carmichael's chosen profession was, he believes, ideal preparation for
things to come. ''As a business language, accountancy is a better
vehicle for certain roles than people give it credit for. And it has
proved vital for me to be tax literate.'' (He took on a significant
interitance tax problem.)
Nonetheless, he concedes he would have exercised more caution with a
client's money than he has done with his own. Since 1980, he has
recruited 25 employees to help him run self-catering cottages, a deer
park, sawmill, meat plant, visitors centre and restaurant, together with
a large mixed livestock and arable unit.
''The inter-relationship between businesses interests me -- the red
deer fill the cottages and visitors' centre whilst producing an
unsubsidised farm product with a lean and healthy 21st-century future,''
Carmichael explains.
In effect, tourists (many of them Carmichaels from overseas) book into
the 15 holiday cottages Richard Carmichael has renovated to Scottish
Tourist Board five-crown standard. His wife Patricia oversees three
employees who attend to this side of the business. With 66% occupancy,
the turnover is approaching #100,000.
Tourists may request delivery of ready-made meat meals while on the
estate -- the product of Carmichael Farm Meats, with venison a
speciality. But deliveries continue even when holidaymakers head for
home.
As with general visitors, self-caterers can eat out too -- on the
estate's Tinto Hill restaurant (turnover #60,000) which also sells
estate meats. Carmichael bought it in 1990 with the proceeds of the sale
of Thankerton Post Office, where he acted as postmaster for two years in
order to keep it open.
All estate visitors are likely to patronise the latest significant
addition -- the Discover Carmichael Visitor Centre which opened 12
months ago.
True to his motto, the clan chief was quick to act when Edinburgh Wax
Collection came up for sale in 1989. He kept the figures in storage
until resources became available to build the centre (a projected 20,000
visitors are expected by the end of the year), farm shop, animal farm,
and playpark.
The sawmill (eight employees and #150,000 turnover) produces a
finished retail product which was used in the construction of the
visitor centre.
A keen orienteer and founder of Tinto Orienteering Club, Richard
Carmichael believes the existence of the processing plant means his
estate woods are kept in good order, ''for visitors to look at and
orienteers to run through''.
An accountant learns to utilise assets to maximum potential. This one
spends his time mulling over the development of new businesses (''I give
the day-to-day running over to individual managers.'') He needs a proven
track record to seek future funding.
A long-term goal is the restoration of the estate's magnificent,
ruined Carmichael House -- the ancestral seat.
''It's not clear what we would renovate Carmichael House for, yet,''
points out the 26th Baron. ''But I think an entity of this stature is a
heritage worth preserving on three levels -- that of family, community
and the nation as a whole.''

A LEADING UK surveying firm is set to expand its operations and
recruitment in Scotland.
Commenting on his firm's annual results for the year to 30 April 1995,
Richard Kwiecinski, chairman of DTZ Debenham Thorpe in Scotland, sad:
''The performance of Scotland within the company as a whole was ahead of
the group average in relation to both turnover and profits. The sheer
strength of our business in Scotland has meant that despite the effects
of the recession, we are now in a position to expand our Scottish
operations.''
Quietly confident that the worst of the downturn is now behind the
property industry, he predicts an increase in market share for his own
firm in Scotland.
The firm's national results show a turnover of #58.19 million, a 1%
increase on the previous year's #57.57 million. Pre-tax profit was #3.65
million, compared with #4.12 million the previous year.

A PROMINENT Argyle Street building has changed hands in a #4m deal and
promptly achieved a rental which shows that Glasgow's prime shopping
pitch is regaining strength after the downturn.
The former Consumer Advice Centre and bank premises at the corner of
St Enoch Square and Argyle Street has been sold to Taylor Clark
Properties for redevelopment.
Formerly owned by Strathclyde Regional Council and the Clydesdale
Bank, the entire development has now been pre-let to Clydesdale Bank on
a full 25-year lease at a Zone A rental of around #127.50 per sq ft.
Dudley Gee of Gee &amp; Co, who represented Taylor Clark in the
transaction, says: ''This deal underlines the strength of Argyle Street.
''Rents are on the way up again and there is significant demand for
Glasgow's prime shopping pitch, we could have let the premises several
times over.''
J Trevor &amp; Webster acted on behalf of the Clydesdale Bank. Gee &amp; Co
has been retained to sell the investment.

TUCKED away in the corner of the Asda supermarket in Coatbridge, the
Coffee Cup cafe has become a thriving business.
It had a difficult start in life, when permission to open it was
withdrawn only days before it was due to begin business. It owes its
existence to the dogged determination of two women, Jennifer Marshall
and Linda Watson, who refused to take no for an answer.
In just two years that determination has earned the pair #5000 of
European funding from the Women's Local Initiative Programme. This was
only the second time the grant has been awarded to a UK business, the
first to a Scottish one. It was followed by the Monklands Enterprise
Best Commercial Business of the Year Award for 1995.
Approaching a bank manager for new business finance can be a
nerve-wracking ordeal. But when the partners concerned are both single
parents and unemployed, the prospect is all the more daunting.
Both Jennifer and Linda were confident that the three months they
spent preparing their business plan and their previous experience would
see them through -- and it did. But that was just the first hurdle.
''Linda and I had worked together for about three years in the hotel
and catering business,'' said Jennifer, 41. ''It had always been my
ambition to run a coffee shop and I decided that Linda would be the
ideal partner.
''I had won a few awards for 'good hygiene' and Linda was the expert
in booking and organising staff. It seemed a good combination.''
Although they originally looked for accommodation in Glasgow,
Jennifer, from Coatbridge, had noticed an empty unit at her local Asda
store and decided that it would be ideal for their purposes.
Their initial approach to the local manager at the supermarket was met
with some scepticism.
However, three days later Jennifer and Linda were back in his office
with the plans. With the help of the Monklands Business Centre, the
girls spent three months preparing their business plan and approached
various banks for finance. Their preparation and attention to detail
impressed the Clydesdale bank in Coatbridge which gave them the backing.
''It was all systems go,'' says Linda, 31, from Baillieston. ''But
then disaster!''
''The very morning we were to get the keys we got news from Asda to
say that company policy had changed and that no food outlets would be
permitted in their stores.
''We were devastated. We had the finance, the equipment -- but no
place to go. We just couldn't take another blow. The training was
intense and very difficult, but now this.''
It took about two weeks for the girls to get over the news but they
were determined not to give up.
''There was only one thing left to do,'' said Jennifer. ''We just went
to the top. We sent a letter to the chairman of Asda explaining our case
and pointing out that a coffee shop would be of benefit to the
Coatbridge store.
''A few days later he wrote back saying he agreed, and that we could
have the unit.''
With the business now well established and a substantial growth in
turnover, there are plans to open a similar ''in-store'' facility at
another location.
In addition to Jennifer and Linda, the company employs two full-time
and five part-time staff. ''When we do find the right location for our
next venture, it will result in employment for another seven people,''
says Jennifer.

DETAILS of 75% of all deals in UK shares will have to be revealed
immediately they are struck from the beginning of next year, compared
with 50% by value currently.
This has been agreed by the Securities and Investments Board and the
London Stock Exchange. The agreement also spells out that 95% of trades
will have to be published within an hour against the present 90 minutes.
The SIB says the changes will greatly improve the ''transparency'' of
the market by making it clearer what trading is actually being carried
out. This will benefit institutions because they will be more certain of
getting the keenest quotes available.
The SIB has issued discussion papers on changes that are needed in the
light of the various ways of dealing open to investors, such as futures,
options and warrants.
The board considers three key requirements are paramount for
successful markets, transparancy, equitable treatment for all
market-users and a reliable pricing process.
SIB chairman Andrew Large said it wants to establish a coherent
approach for an increasingly diversified market, ''based on the firm
conviction that fair competition and free flow of information are by far
the best regulators of markets; and that less restriction and less
regulatory prescription is preferable to more''.

SMALL and medium-sized West of Scotland businesses could benefit from
a Government drive to lease or sell around 100,000 sq ft of premises for
lease or sale.
In a major marketing campaign the Government's Property Drive will be
launched in Glasgow today. It aims to attract new tenants or buyers into
Government premises which are now surplus to requirement. Today's launch
follows a similar event held earlier this year in Edinburgh to market
East of Scotland premises and brings the total Government stock
available to commercial users to 400,000 sq ft.
The extension of the campaign into the West means that properties in
Glasgow, Motherwell, and Greenock are now available. Further properties
in East Kilbride will soon be added to the available stock. The
initiative has been devised by Property Holdings, the Government's
estate managers.
Offices suitable for small and medium-sized companies make up a
significant part of the portfolio. Flexible deals are promised, both in
terms of selling price and lease terms. In many cases incoming tenants
will have the benefit of sharing premises with a Government department
which will take care of building management, maintenance and
housekeeping responsibilities.
Peter Stewart, divisional property manager of Property Holdings, says:
''As well as making more efficient use of Government property, we expect
that this initiative will also give a boost to business in Scotland. All
the properties are available for immediate occupancy and, in some cases,
we may be able to offer temporary accommodation on a stopgap basis with
rental agreements for as short as three months.''
The joint marketing agents for Property Drive are: Chesterton, Hillier
Parker, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, and Ryden.

JOHN Waddington pleased the City with its solid performance last year
during which profit before tax and exceptional items increased by 20% to
#22.6m.
The group was fundamentally changed last year with the disposal of its
games interests, including Monopoly and Cluedo, to focus on the niche
markets of packaging and specialist printing.
Waddington Games was sold to US toymaker Hasbro for #50m last
November, realising a substantial profit of #31m on disposal. These
funds are to be used to fund growth in the continuing Waddington
businesses.
The group made an important step in its efforts to become a
significant player in the packaging industry following the acquisition
of the European cartons company IMCA, which provides a good platform for
overseas growth.
Non-UK operations now account for almost half the group profit.
Within the group, specialist printing had a particularly strong year
increasing its profits by 47% to #5.4m, helped by good growth in the
direct marketing business. Additional capacity is to be installed in
direct marketing.
Pharmaceutical packaging also performed well with profits rising by
20% to #2.4m. This despite an 80% jump in raw material costs.
The group is in a strong financial position going forward with a cash
pile of #11m, despite a near-doubling in capital expenditure last year
to #19m. Capital expenditure is forecast to be around #26m in the
current year.
Shareholders' funds were significantly strengthened by the rights
issue and sale of the games business. They ended the year at #111.4m
compared with #65.4m in 1994.
Earnings per share excluding exceptional items rose by 4.4% to 16.9p,
adjusted for the rights issue last July. Dividends for the year were
increased by 5.6% to 8.7p after a final payment of 4.9p.
Commenting on the results, chief executive Martin Buckley said that
the company was now in a position to accelerate future growth both
organically and via acquisitions.
In the past Waddington has tended to disappoint City analysts with its
results. This was not the case yesterday and so John Waddington shares
gained 10p to 210p where they yield 5.2%.
Given the better-than-expected profits and positive outlook some City
analysts were considering raising their current year profit forecasts
from around #26m.

LOWER profits from the North Sea operations of Bristow Helicopters
dented the performance of Caledonia Investments last year.
Caledonia, which also holds large stakes in Scottish fund managers
Ivory &amp; Sime, said the profit contribution from Bristow Helicopters fell
nearly 40% in the year to March 31.
As a result, pre-tax profits declined slightly to #44.5m from #45.2m
in 1993-94 and earnings per share dropped to 32.5p from 39.3p.
Nevertheless, Caledonia's other interests, ranging from chemicals and
tourism to commercial radio and merchant banking, performed well.
The group therefore raised its dividend to 17p from 16.2p.
Caledonia is almost 50% owned by the Cayzer family, which made its
fortune in shipping.
It owns 45% of Bristow Helicopters which suffered tough competition
from Norwegian and Canadian helicopter firms in the UK sector of the
North Sea last year as a result of changes in European regulations.
Bristow was also hit by the cost-cutting drive of North Sea oil
companies and the number of flights it performed to offshore locations
from Aberdeen fell by 30% last year.
Caledonia chairman Peter Buckley said Bristow would continue to face a
difficult situation in 1995. ''I guess that it's not going to get any
better in the current year and will probably dip a bit,'' he said.

REGIONAL electricity company Norweb is following in the footsteps of
other RECs in seeking shareholders permission for a buy back of shares
(10%) but with a wary eye on the possible impact of regulator Professor
Littlechild's new price and distribution review which is due in the
first two weeks of July. This could inhibit the company's room for
manoeuvre, writes CHRIS STONE.
Meanwhile, profits for the year to March 31, 1995, have grown 15.2%
from #178.3m to #205.4m before tax. There is a final dividend of 20.2p
giving a total of 28.4p for the year, an increase of 23.5% over
1993-94's payout of 23p.
The rise reflects increased profits, a lower effective tax rate and
the full pass through of the benefits of the previous buy back of over
17 million shares. Cover is 3.4 times with earnings per share up from
76.2p to 95.3p.
Chairman and chief executive Ken Harvey warned, though, that the
company could not promise 6%-8% real dividend growth until the end of
the century as previously forecast, before the industry regulator
publishes his new price review.
Adding to these shots across the regulator's bow, he suggests that if
capital expenditure had to be scaled back too harshly, there was a
danger of power cuts as ageing assets are not replaced fast enough.
Norweb claims the lowest customer power charges of any of the 12
English and Welsh privatised RECs and it would fight to maintain its
record of customer service and performance.
The company, which has made a strong start to 1995-96, saw operating
profits in its core distribution business rise 6.4% to #159m while
non-core activities were up from #8m to #9.3m, including a #1m rise in
retail to #8.1m.

AS we await the judges' decision on who will be the 1994-95
TrailBlazer of the Year, John Ker, Head of Owner Managed Business
Services at Ernst &amp; Young, Glasgow, continues our look back at some of
the monthly role models currently in contention.
THE November, 1994, winner, DX Mobile Phones, has been one of
Scotland's recession-beating stories. Set up in 1990 with two staff and
a #3000 overdraft, the company has grown dramatically and now has 80
staff, and eight retail stores throughout Scotland, with a further eight
due to open by the end of this year. Turnover is expected to have grown
from #3.5m in 1994 to an estimated #10m by the end of this year.
Winning awards seems second nature to this company, who has won the
Cellnet UK Dealer of the Year for the last two years. Part of this is
due to the commitment to produce training undergone by staff and the
company philosophy of working with customers to identify specific needs
which can then be filled with appropriate equipment.
The Fife-based paper company, Smith Anderson &amp; Co Ltd has turned its
attention towards environmental friendliness while increasing its
product quality and profitability. This won it the December award.
Innovation has graced this fourth generation, family-owned company
throughout its 135-year history -- it has pioneered recycling technology
for more than 50 years. It recently invested #10m on a total upgrade of
equipment which produces higher quality paper from lower grades of
post-consumer waste, with an increase of 8000 tonnes per year in
productivity for the same energy consumption.
The company manufactures 48 million paper bags and 25 million
polythene bags for the UK and export market each week, making it one of
the biggest integrated paper, polythene, and packaging manufacturers in
the UK, employing around 700 people and generating sales of #50m per
annum.
An idea originally tested in a back garden laboratory sparked a
revolution in contact lens production which won Livingston-based Award
Plc, the first TrailBlazer of 1995. The company have produced the first
high-water content daily-wear/daily disposable contact lens which does
away with the need for cleaning and sterilising solutions.
Having patented the idea back in 1988, the directors drew a blank with
venture capitalists in England and had to look for regional assistance
from Scotland to get their idea developed.
Sales are already 80 times greater than forecast and the company has
had to accelerate its business plan accordingly, with the present goal
to install 10 production lines generating sales with a retail value of
over #100m by 1998. This should expand the workforce of the company to
over 300.
February's winner, Ashfield Medical Systems in Cumbernauld, competes
successfully against multinationals such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and
Kimberley Clark in the manufacture of disposable surgical drapes and
gowns for the UK and overseas market.
Originally working under licence from an American company, the
company, which was recently bought by a major customer, began trading in
1991 using funding from Dunbartonshire Enterprise and this set it on the
course which has seen Ashfield identified by the LEC as having
exceptional growth potential.
Now, whatever the product, Ashfield's quick response times and
flexibility of designs have given a headstart in their bid to become
established in the highly-competitive European market and they supply
customers in Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and Holland.
Although primarily involved in cardiology, the company is also looking
to develop in other medical disciplines such as opthalmology and
orthopaedics. They hope such moves will allow the projected turnover of
#1m for 1995 to double again in 1996.
Next week we review another David among the Goliaths, we address the
quality problem of the Nineties, and we hang on the success of our last
Trailblazer of the Month.

ROBBIE Allen arrived in the theatre business by a circuitous route.
He joined a newsagents' firm in Edinburgh after studying business
administration at the College of Commerce in Glasgow, then became a
civil servant before joining the Raindog theatre group last year.
Raindog was formed four years ago by Scottish actors Robert Carlyle,
Stuart Davids and Caroline Paterson.
Robert Carlyle is better known as Hamish McBeth in the BBC televison
series of the same name, Stuart Davids as Lachy Junior in the series,
and Caroline Paterson as Ruth in Eastenders.
Few people will have heard of Robbie Allen, the theatre group's
administrator, general manager and more lately a co-producer of some of
the company's productions.
But Robbie did not just happen to find a job in theatre. His brother
Stevie is an actor, and Robbie was involved in amateur dramatics at
Strathclyde Art Centre where Raindog was based, although he says that he
only ''dabbled in acting as he was awful at it''.
Raindog was formed because Robert Carlyle, Stuart Davids, and Caroline
Paterson all wanted to do plays of their own choice, and in 1992 put on
their first production, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, in the Art
Centre in Washington Street, Glasgow.
The production certainly came into the low-cost category -- only #800
to put on stage. All three television stars gave up work to do the
production, and did not take a wage from it.
''Glasgow's Year of Culture,'' says Robbie Allen, ''was what
stimulated them to form the company. They saw what Glasgow was capable
of and decided they wanted to do theatre in the city.''
Since then Raindog has put on another seven theatre productions and
co-produced one short film. Now they have decided to diversify.
''Theatre has to be heavily subsidised, and in order to just break
even and to allow us to continue doing what we want in theatre work, we
hope to produce films,'' says Robbie.
Their first venture into films was as co-producers with Andrew David
McDonald of Figment Films who made Shallow Grave, and who are now making
Trainspotting.
The Last Ten Minutes of Chris was co-produced by Caroline Paterson
with Robert Carlyle in the lead role. The film, which was shot in
Ruchill Hospital, Glasgow, was shown in some cinemas along with Shallow
Grave. ''Raindog provided all the actors for this film,'' says Robbie
Allen.
The BBC have already agreed to buy the licence to screen Raindog's
second short film based on a treatment by Caroline Paterson. It is hoped
that production of the 15-minute film The Lucky Suit will begin later
this year.
All three actors behind Raindog will be involved in the production,
which will start in Glasgow later this year. Caroline will direct it,
Robert Carlyle will appear in it, and Stuart Davids will co-produce it
with Robbie.
The move into films, Raindog believe, will allow them to set up a
''poor school'' for actors and also enable them to provide ''shadow''
production positions to allow people to train in theatre and film
production.
''We would like to have educational facilities so that we can feed our
own ranks,'' explains Robbie Allen, ''already six people who have come
to work for us without any previous experience have gone on to work in
the industry, including Tommy Flanagan who appears in Braveheart.''
Robbie Allen is Raindog's only permanent employee but when they are
putting on a play the company provides work for actors and production
staff.
Their last production required 32 people including 18 performers who
were together for 8 weeks.

MBA students at Strathclyde University's business school who plan to
undertake market research in South Africa, Indonesia, and Pakistan this
summer are still desperately short of sponsorship funds.
Others heading for Russia, India, and Venezuela have obtained
last-minute backing from international bodies such as the World Bank and
UK Government departments.
But Scottish firms have so far shown little interest in sponsoring
Strathclyde postgraduates to do research for them on the cheap in these
emerging markets.
''We have got a few people talking to us, but as yet no cash,'' said
Iain Lochhead, one of three students trying to raise #10,000 to research
investment opportunities for UK firms in post-apartheid South Africa.
''If we don't get firmer interest in the next two or three weeks we
are going to have to call it off,'' he added.
''We are stuck, things are looking bad,'' said W C Chan, one of six
students planning to spend three weeks in Indonesia.
After a three-month search for sponsorship the Indonesian team has
received #5000 from a UK construction company.
It urgently needs a further #7000 if the trip is to go ahead.
All the project groups complained of a poor response from local firms.
''We sent out over 60 project packs and have had only one commercial
company coming back with an offer to help us,'' said Luigi Macari, one
of three students going to India.
His group was saved by the World Bank which will pay the students to
spend a month evaluating urban development, telecommunications and power
generation projects.
Three MBA students heading for Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains of
eastern Russia also struck lucky.
The European Union is paying for them to look at the export potential
of privatised industries in the area as part of its assistance programme
for Russia.
Alec Wersun, a former lecturer at Strathclyde Graduate Business School
who is now an EU consultant in Yekaterinburg, helped secure their
sponsorship.
Team Venezuela has secured most of the #12,000 it needs to send six
students to Caracas for a month.
A Singapore company, two UK Government departments and Northumbrian
Water have so far coughed up #8000.
The group is trying to persuade a whisky distiller, a Glasgow
engineering company, and an offshore services group to pay the rest.
''We've got another three weeks to go . . . If we can get #12,000 that
would be fine,'' said Naeem Ahmed, whose group plans to fly out to
Caracas on July 11.
Strathclyde Graduate Business School sets overseas project challenges
for its MBA students every year, but it is up to the students themselves
to arrange finance for the trips.
The participating students come from a wide range of countries and
this enhances their ability to work abroad.
This year's Team Indonesia for instance includes a Malaysian who
speaks the Indonesian national language Bahasa and has already worked in
Jakarta.
Anyone interested in sponsoring one of the MBA student projects should
contact Carol Ann Raferty, MBA course secretary at Strathclyde Graduate
Business School on tel: 0141-553-6000.

A World Bank advance to Glasgow's twin city of Rostov-on-Don may
strengthen Scots links as well as those over the Russian river, writes
Alan Newark
GLASGOW's twin city of Rostov-on-Don has won a $36.95m transport
development credit from the World Bank.
The first deputy mayor of Rostov-on-Don, Alexander Ogarev, has
confirmed that $29.26m will be allocated for vehicle purchases. Of the
remainder, $5.7m will be appropriated to repair 240 buses, 50 trolley
buses, and 50 street cars; $1m will go to import equipment for local
transportation businesses and $880,000 to train personnel and to render
technical assistance to the project.
Extended over 17 years, the credit will carry an annual interest rate
of 7.2% and promises a five-year interest only ''holiday'' period. Mr
Ogarev, who was also the deputy chairman of Russia's Federal Tender
Commission -- which includes the vice mayors of 14 cities whose
transport networks won recent tender competitions, plus representatives
of the World Bank and the Russian Transportation and Finance Ministries,
has outlined tender application details.
Rostov transport companies, and interested Scottish suppliers, must
submit tender bids to the Transportation Ministry by June 13. The winner
will be selected by September 11.
The Rostov city administration, which has launched a customs-free zone
and has plans for three more (which will all form part of the South
Russia Terminus Development Project), has also announced plans to build
a second road bridge over the River Don in the centre of the city.
Recalling Glasgow's problems with the Kingston Bridge, Russian experts
have admitted that Rostov's toll-free Voroshilov Bridge is in urgent
need of repairs and that current usage exceeds the intended maximum
capacity of 40,000 vehicles a day.
Planning for the new six-lane toll bridge, which will carry 20,000
vehicles daily, including traffic using the Moscow-Makhachkala highway
which links Rostov with Grozny in Chechnya and with the Caspian Sea, is
still in its early stages. Rostov city council has commissioned a local
municipal enterprise, Rostgarovtodor, and the Moscow-based
Giprotransmost Research Institute to undertake a feasibility study
which, said Rostgarovtodor director Vladimir Shitikov, is to be
completed by the end of 1995.
Mr Shitikov's deputy, Yakov Lukovsky, told the Sevodnya (Today)
newspaper that the study will be followed by the creation of a joint
stock company or consortium of Russian and foreign investors. The new
body will oversee the completion of project designs and take
responsibility for the management, construction and operation of the
bridge.
At current values, planned investment totals 900 billion Roubles with
approximately 600 million Roubles required to complete the feasibility
study. A further 200 billion Roubles will be needed to begin
construction. Profits will come from vehicle crossings, from associated
petrol stations and from modern maintenance services.
Government measures to strengthen the economy of Southern Russia have
also been bolstered by a number of foreign support projects.
On the River Don, near the Sea of Azov, a consortium of Russian and
German companies is to construct a major terminal capable of handling
550,000 tonnes of grain per annum. The UK Foreign Office Know-How Fund
has recently been advising agricultural agencies in the Rostov,
Krasnodar, and Nizhny Novgorod regions while the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development has launched a Southern Russia Regional
Venture Fund.
According to Rostov city council, the fund is jointly managed with a
French consultancy. Some $30m will be invested in a carefully chosen
group of about 20 local companies. Selection of these companies began in
February and payments -- ranging from $300,000 to $3m and exchanged for
share packages -- will begin in early 1996.
Growing international business activity in Rostov-on-Don,
traditionally known as ''the Gateway to the Caucasus'' and as the home
of the Don cossacks, has also prompted keen official interest in
developing the city's hotels and tourism industry.
Among the loudest backers of municipal efforts to revamp local
transport networks, Rostov's tourism chiefs accept that some hotels
leave a lot to be desired but also stress that the city has a strong
cultural profile and has endured much suffering particularly with regard
to post-war and post-Soviet economic reconstruction.
Mr Joe McLaughlin, Deputy Chief Executive of Glasgow Chamber of
Commerce, recently returned to Rostov-on-Don where he is a forceful
ambassador for Scottish industry in a marketplace which is equally
enthusiastic about trade with Glasgow and other cities north of the
Border. Scottish companies serious about doing business in Southern
Russia, however, are urged to improve their approach and to market
themselves in a more forthright manner if they are to compete with other
EU countries for forthcoming contracts.
Welcoming the Russian Government's recent award of over $4bn from the
International Monetary Fund, Mr McLaughlin said: ''We are currently
preparing for a Trade Mission from Rostov-on-Don which will arrive in
Glasgow in late September or early October. We call upon Scottish
companies to help us prepare a follow-up venture which will hopefully
result in Scottish goods and services being marketed in Rostov and in
the further development of economic relations with the Rostov-on-Don
city authorities.''

LOWER rationalisation costs caused the profits of Dairy Crest to jump
from #2.8m to #22.1m in the year to March, though operating profits from
continuing activities were slightly lower at #29.8m, writes CHRISTOPHER
SIMS.
Dairy Crest is the processing arm of the former Milk Marketing Board
and is currently owned by dairy farmers. The state of the dairy market
prevented Dairy Crest going for an early flotation and alternative
funding was put in place. Chairman Michael Dowdall said it remained
prepared for a stock market listing.
In common with the other dairy groups, the company has rationalised
its plants in the face of the decline in doorstep milk deliveries,
though rationalisation costs were down from #35.5m to #11.2m.
Chief executive John Houliston said the industry needed a period of
stability. ''Although another significant increase in the cost of milk
this autumn would make short-term progress difficult, Dairy Crest is
well positioned to show further profitable growth,'' he proclaimed.
Mr Houliston added he was particularly pleased with the core consumer
foods division, comprising butter, milk, cheese, spreads and fresh dairy
products, which saw sales rise by 2.5% to #330m and operating profits
#1.5m higher at #16.9m.
The volume of milk supplied by Dairy Crest to the supermarket chains
has continued to expand and represents nearly half of all liquid milk
supplied by the company.

STEWART and Doreen Binning are a Prestwick couple who are putting the
case for business with great gusto, writes HUGH DOUGHERTY.
Trireme, their business, makes display cases to allow modellers and
collectors to display their pride and joy in safe, secure and dust-free
zones.
The Trireme catalogue states the reason behind the business very
eloquently: ''Lift your treasures from the shoe box in the cupboard and
create your very own miniature museum with Trireme display cases. Let
your family and friends share and enjoy the effort, time and expense
that you have spent on your hobby.''
Mr Binning, a modeller, first and foremost, of ancient Greek warships,
hence the Trireme in their title, decided to have a go making display
cases for himself, when he found them hard to get in Scotland.
''I looked around, decided to make some of my own, and started to get
orders from friends. Now we have rented premises, employ two salesman on
a commission basis, and are expanding fast, with commissions and mail
order keeping us more than busy,'' he said.
While Mr Binning makes the wooden and glass cases, his wife deals with
the mail orders.
''You could say we're a real family business,'' she smiled. ''Our two
children also help out at busy periods.''
Trireme's prime outlet is through model shops, but Mr Binning has also
found a new market in the museums business, while a growing number of
model collectors reads about Trireme in hobby magazines.
''With a rise in the number of collectors in general, we know that our
cases are used to show off everything from Dinky model cars to
butterflies,'' said Mr Binning.
And, with VE-Day nostalgia very much in mind, Trireme has been doing
good business, since early June, in cases for medal displays.
''We also do cases with built-in displays of cigarette card
reproductions,'' said Mrs Binning.

JETSTREAM, the Prestwick-based British Aerospace company, is using
university-sourced language training courses to assist in implementing
an amalgamation with European companies.
''In the increasingly competitive aero industry, the only way forward
is to amalgamate and form a consortium,'' said Peter Black, Jetstream's
head of government and public affairs.
''Neither government nor the private sector seems all that keen on
coming up with money to invest in commercial aircraft. There are
astronomical sums involved, and we have to do things ourselves and
rationalise in world-wide terms.
''In an amalgamation with Alenia of Italy and Aerospatiale of France,
there will be a new company set up, for sales, marketing and after-sales
service.
''Part of the new set-up will mean a move to Toulouse for between 150
and 200 of our employees, presently on our payroll at Prestwick.
Obviously, being able to speak French is a basic necessity and we have
been implementing a language training programme in-house.
''Strathclyde University secured the contract, with backing from
Enterprise Ayrshire, and 40 employees have now succeeded in gaining
certificates of competence in French. They were presented only this
week.
''There is no suggestion of Jetstream walking away from its Prestwick
base,'' he added. ''Something like #300m has been invested over the past
12 months, centred on Prestwick, our turbo-prop home base.
''This is really the start of an 18-month programme of discussing
matters with employees, offering them opportunities in an expanding
situation, and overcoming any problems.''
Mike O'Callaghan, Jetstream's new managing director, said: ''We are
about to embark on the next stage of advancement, by adopting a vigorous
European role with our new partners.
''Our people are eager to move forward and are seizing every chance to
increase their grip on the opportunities now before them. Obviously,
learning a new language and discovering the culture behind it will
enhance their capabilities even more.
''I'm proud to see so many of my colleagues successfully completing
the university curriculum.''
For Enterprise Ayrshire, Greg McLelland describes the training move as
an ''excellent example'' of work by their trade development unit.
''We always seek to assist any increase in a company's export market,
and language is still one of the barriers to be overcome.''

DE BEERS yesterday said sales of rough diamonds by its Central Selling
Organisation (CSO) fell 1.6% in the first half of the year and it was
cautious about sales in the second half.
The CSO sold $2540m of rough diamonds in the first six months of 1995.
''While rough diamond sales for the first half of 1995 have held up
well in line with continuing growth in world retail demand, the CSO
remains cautious about second-half sales,'' De Beers said.
In terms of South African rand, sales for the half year totalled
R9120m, 0.9% higher than a year earlier.
''Prospects for the retail diamond jewellery market remain positive in
most parts of the world,'' the company said.
During 1994, world retail sales rose by 4% in dollar terms to a new
record level. The US market saw an increase of 7%.
Although Japanese retail sales fell by 5% in yen terms last year, they
were up by 3% in dollars.
Retail diamond jewellery sales in East Asia are still showing strong
growth and grew by about 8% in dollar terms last year.
In Europe, retail sales were mixed.

A MAJOR Scots whisky TV advertising campaign is unlikely to be
launched this side of summer, writes BILL MAGEE.
This is the industry's position even though the distillers need a
welcome boost following a drop in sales caused by high taxes on whisky.
Summer is a period when sales of the nation's favourite dram
traditionally dip, the industry has, therefore, signalled it is to take
a measured approach to television commercials.
A 40-year Independent TV no-spirits rule governing advertisements has
ended and a vodka commercial was recently screened nationwide.
However, senior sources in the whisky industry have indicated they
will not be following what was considered a PR stunt by Richard
Branson's Virgin empire.
Steve Boland, brands director of United Distillers, said normal
commercial confidentiality covered the Perth-based whisky giant's
advertising plans.
It is understood the company's strategy will not be a ''one off'' like
Virgin's vodka commercial.
''A product like the Bell's 8-year-old, Britain's biggest selling
whisky, demands an approach both full of style and consideration in
keeping with the brand,'' Mr Boland said.
An advertising campaign, therefore, took time to prepare properly
before it was ready for screening on television.
* RUSSIA's latest export -- a new brand of vodka -- was launched in
Edinburgh yesterday, as part of the effort to wean spirit drinkers off
the Scottish national tipple.
Smirnoff Black, said to be the world's most exclusive brand of the
product, is being introduced to 16 outlets in the capital. It is already
available in some shops in Glasgow.

BRITISH Polythene Industries yesterday announced its sixth acquisition
in three months, with a #760,000 purchase which further strengthens its
recycling business.
None of the Greenock-based company's acquisitions so far this year
have cost more than #2m but BPI is looking to step up a gear.
Jack Paton, managing director of BPI's industrial division, envisages
that the group's future acquisitions will be predominantly in the #2m to
#10m range.
The industry, because it is dominated by a few large players, offers
few #10m-plus opportunities.
Derbyshire-based Ensign Polymers, which employs about 50 people, is
the latest addition to BPI's industrial division.
BPI will focus the Ilkeston plant exclusively on the recycling of
industrial polythene waste and the production of refuse sacks --
operations which currently account for about 80% of its business.
Ensign's carrier bag and plain packaging production will be
transferred elsewhere within BPI but no redundancies are envisaged
because of plans to increase activity at the Derbyshire plant.
BPI will pay #712,705 in cash, with the remainder of the consideration
satisfied by the issue of 8075 Ordinary shares. It will also assume debt
of #728,574.
The knock-on effect of rapid raw material price rises has boosted
Ensign's annualised turnover to about #4m. In the 10 months to
end-March, Ensign made pre-tax profits of #28,664 and its net assets
totalled #433,793 at the end of the period.
Mr Paton said BPI's latest purchase underlined its commitment to
expand its recycling business.
Back in March, the company announced a #2m investment in a factory at
Dumfries, purchased from Swiss confectionery giant Nestle, which will
recycle waste polythene from farms.
BPI has about 30% of the UK polythene packaging market, which is worth
more than #1000m annually in sales terms.
Its shares were yesterday unchanged at 589p.

THE UK pensions and life assurance industry was bitterly attacked
yesterday by one of its key figures who described it as being in a
''dismal state''.
Managing director of Eagle Star Life, Dr Ian Owen, accused the
industry of following discredited practices and failing to demonstrate
to consumers that it provided a transparently fair deal.
Speaking at an industry conference, Dr Owen said life offices needed
to rethink their relationship with consumers and radically reform the
way they do business to maintain their strong position in the financial
services market.
Describing the life and pensions industry as being in a ''dismal
state'', Dr Owen highlighted problems in the industry which, he said,
needed to make great strides to regain the respect and trust of
consumers, including reassurance that they were getting value for money.
The changes needed to bridge the gulf that has grown up between life
companies and consumers include:
* A shift from developing products and services that primarily meet
the needs of distributors to ones that are geared closely to the
requirements of customers.
* The introduction of life and pensions plans that are genuinely
flexible in contrast to many current offerings which in practice are
often fairly unadaptable or provide flexibility only at a price.
* the rebuilding of policy administration systems which in most
offices remain cumbersome, costly and incompatible with product
flexibility.
* The use of much clearer and simpler product charges which the new
disclosure rules have done little to encourage and a reduction in the
overall level of product charges.
Dr Owen said the life industry's response so far to the new regulatory
regime had been disappointing.
''So anxious have many life offices been to comply with the new rules
that they have lost sight of the bigger issue -- that is how they can
work to rebuild the trust of consumers and secure a viable future in the
long term savings market.''
Eagle Star itself had adopted a radical approach. All its new
generation life and pensions policies, which will be launched in the
coming months, would carry simple, clear and low charges.
''The sad fact is that our industry, despite what it may say, has
failed, and is continuing to fail, to recognise and respond to the needs
of consumers.
''Over the last 10 or 15 years, our industry has expended a great
amount of energy, ingenuity and money on complicating straightforward
needs.
''Those consumer needs that existed 15 years ago exist today and we
insist on bamboozling our customers with the complexity created by an
ever increasing array of bells and whistles to our products.
''The problem is not just of consumers being sold products they do not
need or want. All too often they do not even understand what it is they
have bought.''

SMALL shareholders are revolting. Does that mean that big shareholders
are not?
The English language is fascinating; the delivery of a phrase or
sentence or the slightest inflection can change the whole meaning and
interpretation of a writer or speaker's intention.
Years ago, a teacher of mine told me that it was not what was said,
but how it was said that was the key to good communication. It seems to
me that communication is a problem which is alive and thriving in the
boardrooms of some of our largest companies.
The much-debated topic of boardroom excess is the hot potato at the
moment and not without cause. Of late, there have been some badly
delivered messages uttered from the mouths of our so-called captains of
industry. Most reasonable individuals will applaud success and welcome
the victor home in local-boy-makes-good style but what really makes
shareholders go on the march is the double-standard syndrome where it
appears that there are rules for some but not for others.
Witness the many salary increases for top executives whilst a
downsizing (that's redundancy to you and me) is going on, and what about
rolling contracts which allow even those who have failed to exit stage
left with what amounts to a good win on the Lottery?
This was brought to light recently in the near #2.1 million shared
amongst the former directors of Dawson International, and that was after
years of an under-performing share price and losses running at over #90
million in 1994. It is not the first time such a fiasco has occurred but
surely we thought it had to be the last.
Not so. Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water,
the managing director of UK retailing at WH Smith resigned after a
surprise profit warning which sent the share price spinning. A two-year
rolling contract will ensure a substantial six-figure payout, adding
insult to the injury inflicted on the shareholders.
The bright young graduates from our universities could almost be
forgiven for aspiring to a main board position -- mess something up and
retire to a second home somewhere in the South of France.
Alistair Ross Goobey, a leading City figure, was the first to stick
his neck out when he said he could best serve the shareholders he
represented by voting against rolling contracts. Since then, the game
has moved into overdrive, with normally subdued onlookers becoming
involved.
Witness tanks turning up to protest against arms deals (surely a novel
sight at a clearing bank's AGM) a pot-bellied forty-pound pig, called
Cedric, gorging at a trough whilst lightening the load for the many
British Gas private shareholders who travelled to London's Docklands to
harangue the chief executive, Cedric Brown, a man best known for his
salary increase and not what he has done for the company. These are the
printable examples.
The good old days when attending an AGM was like watching paint dry
are long gone, thank heaven. In my view, what we need to see are more
investment professionals who are prepared to ask the really tough
questions and demand satisfactory answers. Clients, policy holders, and
shareholders should not be sold short by those who are entrusted with
other peoples' assets.
If you were to ask even the most hardened money man or woman for their
personal opinion, they would tell you that they think some of the
current happenings are scandalous, but what are they doing about it?
On the defence side of the equation, the Cadbury Report has been
adopted by most quoted players, but there is still room for improvement
even though most employees and directors of quoted companies receive
options and bonuses based on their performance.
Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, is leading a group
charged with sorting out the problem of salary packages, but how
independent can this body be, given the vested interests held by the
people involved? How many poachers turned gamekeeper have been truly
successful?
Perhaps we should take a close look at the role of individual
companies' remuneration committees; if we controlled their composition,
we might see some real progress. We need to see more evidence of linking
salary to earnings per share, or some other easily recognisable
performance-to-reward ratios. This would provide a clearer
black-and-white view and not the many shades of grey in evidence at the
moment.
One other important point is that a decline in performance should also
be dealt with accordingly, or, in the words of a stockbroker, the value
of your shares can go down as well as up.
In days gone by, falling on your sword meant just that, and the
revolver in a quiet room was an option, not that I am suggesting either.
However, payment for honest, hard-earned success is something we can all
buy into. Payoff for failure is too much to swallow.
* Bill McCall, a director of Tilney &amp; Company (Stockbrokers and Fund
Managers) was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

IF John Clancy's silent submarine in his Red October novel is ever to
become a reality there is every chance that engineers at Scotland's
National Engineering Laboratory (NEL) in East Kilbride will be involved
in designing it, for the NEL is in the forefront of noise engineering --
which aims to bring more peace and quiet into our lives.
However when it comes to blowing their own trumpet NEL can no longer
afford to be so quiet.
Formerly an agency of the DTI, 90% of their funding came from the
Government but now the East Kilbride facilities are in the process of
being privatised and the drive is on to earn more fees from the private
sector.
Government funding now accounts for only 50% of the laboratory's
income and Derek Lee, NEL's marketing director has the job of helping to
find new markets for the skills of the 150 engineers and scientists
employed there.
Although stressing the NEL's broad range of skills Mr Lee, who until
18 months ago was in the private sector, pinpointed the East Kilbride
plant's special skills in renewable power sources and noise technology.
''Scotland is one of the most relevant areas in Europe for wind
power,'' says Derek Lee which perhaps explains the NEL's special
interest in this alternative source of energy.
The laboratory operates the Myershill Wind Farm which feeds
electricity into the grid, and Derek Lee believes that there is a future
for this type of energy source, particularly in Scotland.
He agrees that you have to be careful about siting, and that there are
concerns about noise emanating from wind farms but points out that the
NEL is bringing another of their specialist skills in noise-abatement
engineering to bear on this problem.
''We have done a lot of work in noise reduction in this field,'' says
Derek Lee.
The NEL, explains Derek, is heavily involved in noise engineering and
has been associated with a number of car manufacturers in making their
cars quieter. But this technology can be adapted for other uses such as
making the household vacuum cleaner quieter -- perhaps a small conquest
in the scientific world but something many in the home will be thankful
for.
Later this year NEL's future ownership will be decided but the present
management of the facility is confident that the skills will not be lost
to Scotland.

WE were swapping fax nightmares yesterday during the Nerd House coffee
break, and thinking of setting up some sort of league table. In the
lead, with 10 points, was undoubtedly Mr Patrick Robertson a friend of
the Rt Hon Jonathan Aitken and a public relations adviser, whose
confidential fax to the Treasury minister ended up instead on the
machine of a New Zealand arts producer, and thence to the front pages of
several grateful newspapers.
''It only takes one wrong digit when you're keying in the number''
said The Braces . ''It's interesting to think of the fax machine as a
free traveller across the social strata, bringing a Treasury minister
and a New Zealand arts producer into closer proximity than they're ever
liable to experience in life.''
It was also fascinating to contemplate the concept of a New Zealand
arts producer. None of us, probably including Mr Jonathan Aitken, had
ever heard of one before. Well, we decided, he kens noo. And clearly,
like Mr Jonah Lomu, the average New Zealand arts producer knows how to
run with the ball.
But returning to fax nightmares, I disclosed how -- when I was living
in a Tayside farmhouse -- I received a fax from the personnel officer of
a major construction company setting out the dates for the staff annual
holidays. This was supposed to go to head office in Manchester: instead,
it ended up among the cowpats and set aside fields of Strathmore. It
wasn't interesting enough to pass on to the newspapers though.
That, said The Braces, hardly sounds like a nightmare. ''It was,'' I
protested. ''It used up half-a-roll of fax paper and I was never
compensated.'' All right, said the others. Three points.
Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, also had a
fax story to impart. It was about the near-namesake, the Filofax group,
which has just announced a 51% profit increase for last year.
''Our chairman had asked me to do an assessment,'' she said. ''It was
a job to work on over the weekend. On Sunday night, I sent a fax to his
home number, saying Filofax couldn't be recommended following the demise
of the Yuppie market. But as we've just learned, I was miles off the
mark. I still wake up sweating.''
But that's not a fax nightmare, we said. ''Oh yes it is.'' said
Angelica. ''The Chairman told me on Monday he hadn't received the fax.
That's good news on the one hand, because it was duff advice. But on the
other hand, somebody did receive it and I don't know who. It's haunting
me.''
Five points, we decided. At least, the signs were that Angelica's fax
hadn't ended up in the office of a New Zealand arts producer. Thank
goodness for small mercies. But, we agreed, until the day when fax
machines are programmed to say ''Sorry, wrong number'' life will remain
interesting.
* A report on ''The UK fragrance market'' tells us that not everything
is coming up smelling like roses. On the one hand, new
''celebrity-branded'' fragrances are being launched almost daily, linked
to such figures as Luciano Pavarotti and Welsh rugby international Ieuan
Evans. (I am not making this up.) But on the other hand, the
eu-de-rugger, named Ieuan Number 14, has been withdrawn from the shops
with only 30 bottles sold. So there.
Nevertheless, the search must go on for more and more celebrities who
could be invited to link their names to a new fragrance. Here are some
names which the sniff sector might like to consider.
Captain Greenpeace: This is a bath oil with a persistent, lingering
fragrance. Tested on humans, it has been found effective even in very
heavy showers of salt water.
Sir Bruce Pattullo: Also known as ''Boardroom Windfall'', this is a
strong aroma which -- as the Governor of the Bank of Scotland warned at
this week's annual meeting -- gets right up people's noses.
Bernard Manning: Starting out as a ''vile and offensive'' niff, this
scent becomes magically gentler and appealing when the wearer appears
before licensing committees etc.
Would you like a smell to bear your name? Apply, sending stamped
addressed envelope, to UK Fragrance Market, London.

TESSA Simpson's job is to help other people find a job.
She is a career counsellor, dealing with people who have lost
confidence in their ability or who believe they are on the shelf.
''If you make up your mind that you are never going to get a job --
you won't,'' she says bluntly.
Tessa, who set up her own business three years ago, says that only one
job in five is advertised. If people want a job, she says, they have to
go out and find one. Others come to her because they are considering a
change in career or want advice about interviews.
''Never ask people for a job,'' she says. ''Use your contact base as a
network, but never say to anyone that you want to meet them because you
want a job. Say that you are looking for advice, and from everyone you
meet, try to get another two names of people who may be able to offer
advice.''
This means that people are more likely to agree to see you because
they are not worried about disappointing you, and once in the meeting,
job opportunities may arise.
Another method, according to Tessa, is cold calling, but she advises
strongly against contacting a personnel department.
''Any vacancies are in specific departments and you should always find
out the name of the head of department and contact him.''
Tessa advises older clients not to attempt to find a single full-time
job but to look at putting together a portfolio of part-time jobs.
She recalls the instance of one 58-year-old man who took her advice to
build up a number of part-time positions.
''He had a meeting with a managing director ostensibly to seek advice.
The MD offered him a part-time job on the spot.''
''It is very satisfying to see people leaving more confident, and then
to later discover they have succeeded in either finding a new job, or
changing the course of their career.''

GEC has won the battle for VSEL with its #835m knock-out bid, which
rival British Aerospace has decided not to contest. This sensible
decision was welcomed in the market where BAe shares jumped 26p to 558p.
In his revised bid Lord Weinstock, GEC chief executive, made it
abundantly clear that he wanted VSEL come what may and BAe simply could
not compete with the financial firepower at his disposal.
Fortunately it has decided not to go for a heroic last try to trump
GEC, which with its innovative ''trombone'' rights issue, it could have
done, though it would have been stretching itself.
Now VSEL is recommending shareholders accept the GEC offer of #21.50
cash per share. The BAe two-part rights issue to finance its bid has
been scrapped and the first instalment will be repaid to shareholders by
July 19 with interest at 8%. The second instalment is automatically
cancelled.
BAe chief executive Dick Evans explained that buying VSEL at a higher
price than GEC was offering would be materially dilutive given the
outlook for BAe's results and the outlook for VSEL profits as the
Trident programme winds down.
VSEL always looked a more logical purchase for GEC given the latter's
existing warship building operation at Yarrow and the electronic gadgets
supplied to the Trident programme by GEC-Marconi.
A purchase by BAe would have been a diversification, though in theory
giving the group the scope for selling big package deals in defence
equipment, including warships, aircraft and weapon systems. At least as
important were the tax advantages, where VSEL profits could be offset
against BAe's past tax losses.
Had the aerospace group decided to press on it would have faced a
revolt by institutional shareholders who had made it clear they would
oppose a dilutive bid. BAe's prospects are considered sound enough
without VSEL and its share price has rallied strongly this year because
of this, not because it might have won the submarine builder.
BAe's order book stands at nearly #10bn and progress is being made in
collaborative ventures in Europe which are so important now that there
is less business around. It is also necessary to form larger units to
match the competitive threat from a rationalised US industry, which now
contains giants like Lockhead Martin Marietta able to act as prime
contractor for whole arms programmes.
The marketing deal with Saab of Sweden to sell the Gripen fighter
worldwide has recently been agreed and the long discussions with Matra
of France to merge the two companies' missile businesses are at last
nearing a conclusion. There is also the possibility of a joint venture
between Royal Ordnance and another French group, Giat.
The group has much experience of collaborative ventures through the
Airbus consortium, for which it makes the wings, the Eurofighter and now
Eurocopter. It is clearly the only way forward for the industry.
Lord Weinstock certainly would not disagree since what he would like
to do before finally stepping down would be to merge BAe's defence
interests with his own. He was even perhaps half hoping BAe would weaken
itself by over-paying for VSEL so leaving it vulnerable to a bid. BAe's
withdrawal from the fight means it will be stronger to fight off GEC
should it try for the ultimate prize.
Lord Weinstock is unlikely to do anything in the short term but
feelers will no doubt be put out at some stage, possibly when BAe
encounters a setback. Lord Weinstock would undoubtedly prefer an agreed
deal.
However all that is in the future and for the moment BAe has quite a
lot going for it given the success of the Airbus programme, the second
phase of the legendary Al-Yamamah contract and the Eurofighter. If the
Eurocopter wins the current battle for the UK helicopter order this
would be a further boost.

Minutes of the meeting which show how the two men fell out over
interest rates
DEEP divisions over interest rates between the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England were revealed
yesterday in the published minutes of their controversial meeting on May
5, the day after the local elections in England and Wales.
The City had expected that the minutes would show the Governor, Eddie
George, pressing for a rise in rates and the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke,
rebuffing him.
But the detailed record suggested that the conflict between the two
men was fundamental. James Capel's David Walton said the Governor's
advice was as ''strong a recommendation to raise base rates as you are
ever likely to see in these minutes.''
He also warned that unless base rates were increased by 1% over the
next six to nine months there was a serious risk of a sustained breach
of the upper end of the 1% to 4% target range for inflation next year.
James Capel's Adam Cole was disturbed by the fact that the Chancellor
made almost no reference to the weakness of sterling apart from noting
that it was little changed from a month earlier.
However, in trade weighted terms the pound was, and still is, down by
almost 5% from the beginning of the year.
''That this is apparently not a cause for concern for Mr Clarke is
very worrying and increases the downside risk for sterling from here.''
Publication of the minutes dispelled fears that they would be less
than frank about the divisions between the two men.
The Governor had three main concerns. Cost and price pressures were
still strong and anecdotal evidence suggested that they might be getting
stronger.
Second the economy continued to grow at well above its trend rate.
Third the pound remained weak. This had caused the Bank to revise
upwards its expectation of inflation over the next two years as its
quarterly inflation report made public the following week.
The Governor told the Chancellor that if interest rastes were
unchanged underlying inflation would rise to 3.5% to 4% next summer and
remain in the upper half of the target range by spring 1997.
He argued that the risk of higher inflation was much greater than the
risk of economic overkill. Credibility might be undermined if no action
were taken on rates and the exchange rate could fall. It did, but was
rescued by a recovery in the dollar and a string of data emphasing the
weak elements in the economy.
Mr George argued his case very fully as if he were aware that the
Chancellor was set to reject his advice.
Mr Clarke said the decision was finely balanced, ''perhaps more so
than the Governor had suggested.'' He argued that there was clear
evidence that growth had been slowing to a more sustainable rate and the
full effects of the previous policy tightening had still to be felt. In
his judgment the data did not justify a rise in interest rates in May.
The Chancellor said that too much emphasis should not be placed on the
GDP figures, then showing the economy grew at 0.8% in the first quarter.
''Anecdotal evidence did not suggest that the service sector was
growing as rapidly as the statistics suggested.''
The National Lottery accounted for 0.1% of quarterly growth.
''Abstracting from this, the quarterly growth rate in Q1 was equivalent
to an annual rate of around 2.8%.''
In the Chancellor's view it was not clear that such a rate of growth
was unsustainable. But most commentators, including the Bank of England,
agree that the long-term sustainable growth rate in the UK is around
2.25%.
Adam Cole said, ''Mr Clarke's unsupported assertion that it could be
higher sounds dangerously Lawsonian and is a clear signal that the
Chancellor places as high a priority on growth as on meeting the
inflation target.''
Since the meeting the Chancellor has drawn comfort from a downward
revision to first quarter GDP to 0.7%, a slower rate of decline in
unemployment, and a decline in housing market activity and house prices.
From the Governor's point of view CBI survey data have remained
buoyant, factory gate price inflation has been revised upwards, the
inflation rate has continued to edge up, and monetary growth has
accelerated.
The June meeting has come and gone without rates being increased. The
impasse between the two men could continue for months, perhaps longer if
the Chancellor is prepared to put the emphasis on growth rather than
inflation.
But he is adopting a lonely and dangerous position which could expose
him to severe criticism if things go badly wrong.
On Tuesday the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
said that base rates, currently 6.75%, would have to rise to about 8% to
slow the economy down.
Governor (Eddie George):
There was the risk to credibility of the policy approach, if the
authorities were seen to be prepared to take risks on the side of
inflation. Given this country's history, inflation expectations and
inflation itself were likely to accelerate because of that. This would
risk undermining the best prospect of sustained, non-inflationary growth
for ages. And there would be a price to pay for that too in the longer
term in terms of a higher uncertainty premium on interest rates.
Chancellor (Kenneth Clarke):
The financial markets had shown a tendency to over-estimate the level
of interest rates required to meet the Government's inflation target. If
interest rates were to be raised simply to match market expectations,
then they could rise above the level required to meet the policy
objective. In his judgment, with the data so unclear at the moment, the
balance of risks was that an interest rate increase now would result in
a higher policy stance than was necessary to meet the inflation
objective, and depress activity further when it was already slowing.

DRAGONFLIES put paid to farming so Ian Winter turned to barbecues
instead. Each week two tonnes of orchard wood go up in smoke with his
blessing -- the aromatic wafts reaching into every corner of the land.
For because of a protection order on his dragonflies that crushed
farming ambitions the estate owner who wanted the wide open spaces has
hit it big in suburbia with a world first and a roaring trade . . . foil
boxes of apple and plum tree wood chips that make back garden barbecues
an olefactory sensation, the bosky scent a sure-fire winner over the
pungent fumes of starter fuel and immolated lamb.
What Ian Winter makes in the outbuildings at his Laggan Estate close
to Strathyre are foil packs of dried and chipped branches from fruit
trees for cooking along with the sausages and chicken drum sticks . . .
just pierce holes in the top of the pack, put it on the glowing charcoal
and breathe your fill.
''When we bought the estate there was notification that it could be
declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest to protect dragonflies
but we thought that would just affect the taking of game and wildlife,
that farming would be permitted. In any case we had to move quickly to
get it,'' says Ian Winter.
''But when the SSSI was imposed it allowed us to go for the game and
wildlife but ruled out farming -- opposite to what we had thought but
there it was. We had to find something else.''

AT a time when many in the construction sector are still trying to
shake off recession and make money out of paper-thin contract margins,
the Edinburgh-based Morrison Construction Group has reported another
record-breaking year.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March soared 50% to #7.6m, despite a
#2m fall in turnover to #218m. All four divisions contributed to the
result, including civil engineering, which had incurred a #900,000 loss
in the previous year.
Group chairman Fraser Morrison hailed the results as a strong
vindication of his company's changed strategic approach, which
increasingly eschews traditional, reactive competitive bidding for work
and emphasises instead offering clients creative, cost-saving solutions
and generating work through Morrison-inspired initiatives.
Work that emphasises value for money and sidesteps the traditional
lowest price tender approach accounts for more than 50% of Morrison's
total workload, compared with just 20% at the time of the group's
buy-out from Charter five years ago.
Mr Morrison said the aim is to get that proportion to 80% by the end
of the century. The group has 27 business development teams, involving
84 people active right across the country. The chairman is confident
that, even if competitors increasingly copy the Morrison approach, the
experience built up so far will ensure that lead can be maintained.
Opportunities thrown up by the Government's private finance initiative
(PFI), where Morrison has pre-qualified as part of consortia on a range
of health and road building projects, could help it achieve that goal.
Even at its low point in the recession, in 1993, Morrison still stayed
in the black, to the tune of #3.3m pre-tax. Its growing financial
strength is underlined by shareholders' funds, which stood at #1m at the
time of the buy-out and have reached #18.6m, a rise of 24% on the
previous year.
The group ended 1994/95 with net cash of #4m. Apart from investing in
the PFI, Morrison has also invested quite heavily in a range of overseas
markets. It currently has work in the former East Germany, St
Petersburg, Azerbaijan, and Kuwait. Overseas turnover is, however, still
less than 5% of the total.
As part of its determination to shadow public company standards,
Morrison added three non-executive directors to its board in April. They
are Alistair Hamilton, former senior partner with lawyers McGrigor
Donald; Lord Sanderson of Bowden, former minister of state at the
Scottish Office; and Nelson Robertson, group chief executive of General
Accident.
''It would be very easy for us now to step up and become a public
company,'' said Mr Morrison. ''Since we have no major institutional
investors, the timing is in our own hands, if we decide to do that.''
Most of the group's shares are owned by Fraser Morrison, his younger
brother Gordon, and their families. Other executive directors also have
smaller stakes.
Building and property development, an integrated division at Morrison,
accounted for 48% of sales and 63% of profits last year. The only
division to show declining profitability on 1994 was utility and energy,
where one bad contract held progress back.

TWO of Europe's Ryder Cup heroes in recent times could be posted
missing when captain Bernard Gallacher finalizes his team come September
for this year's battle at Oak Hill in Rochester, New York.
Seve Ballesteros is once again suffering from back trouble, while
fellow-Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal is facing yet another operation to
try to cure his foot problems.
Olazabal has a small tumour on his right foot which, while not
preventing him playing, puts a question mark over him for Oak Hill. ''If
the match was next week he would not be able to walk 36 holes,'' said
his manager, Sergio Gomez.''The tumour is only half the size of a grain
of rice, but it is touching the nerves of two toes and is very
painful.''
Surgery is the only cure -- and this only five months after he had an
operation to shorten his big toe -- but the 29-year-old Spaniard cannot
go into hospital straight away because of the inflammation. He is due to
play in both the Irish and Scottish Opens before the Open Championship,
but will delay a decision until just before each event.
Ballesteros's back went a fortnight ago and since then he has missed
the halfway cut in both the Kemper Open and US Open, and he has been
forced to pull out of this week's French Open in Paris. ''Seve thinks it
may have been caused by doing one of his exercises wrongly,'' added
Gomez. ''He was very bad. He was receiving physio all the time in
America.''
It would be a major blow to Europe's hopes of regaining the famous cup
if they had to face the Americans without the two Spaniards, who have
been beaten only twice in 15 matches as a partnership.

ANY doubts about who was the main man in the England cricket camp were
firmly dispelled by Ray Illingworth on the eve of today's second Test
against the West Indies at Lord's.
Illingworth pulled rank on his fellow selectors, dropping
Worcestershire wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes before he had even made his
Test comeback, and re-installing Alec Stewart as opener, in addition to
his glove duties.
Unhappy at entering a Test match with just four front-line bowlers,
former England skipper Illingworth managed to coax Stewart into filling
both roles, despite the Surrey man's unhappiness at the situation -- and
just 72 hours after announcing that Rhodes would play.
Rhodes, understandably dismayed, uttered an ''I'm obviously
disappointed'' comment, adding that the chairman had told him not to say
much to the media.
''There has been no arm-twisting,'' insisted Illingworth, while
vice-captain Stewart agreed fully to ''resume'' his dual role. ''I'm
happy to do it,'' said Stewart.
''The selectors changed their minds and I just get on with the job.
But I don't think it's a gamble.''
In the first Test at Headingley 10 days ago, Stewart again suffered a
dip in form with the bat while playing as a keeper-cum-batsman, managing
scores of just 4 and 2 as England were beaten by nine wickets.
However, having persuaded Stewart and fellow selectors -- captain Mike
Atherton, Fred Titmus, and David Graveney -- to think again, Illingworth
will be able to name his ideal side of six specialist batsmen and five
bowlers as England attempt to square the series.
''Ray has talked to Alec at length over the last day or two,''
confirmed Atherton. ''I am one of the selectors and this is the final
decision we have made.''
Stewart will open if England bat first. But he may still do that job
even after a lengthy session behind the stumps, provided he is not too
fatigued.
Robin Smith -- who opened with Atherton in the first Test at Leeds --
could deputise if needed. However, the hard-hitting Hampshire batsman
looked nowhere near international quality at the top of the order in the
opening rubber, making 16 and 6 at Headingley.
All in all, it amounts to a major gamble by England -- and especially
Illingworth -- as they try to strike back immediately from the Leeds
debacle. While his fellow selectors were consulted throughout, it is
undeniably Illingworth's team that will take the field at Lord's.
That alone must make Atherton wonder whether his role as captain has
been seriously and irrepairably damaged. A policy was agreed on Saturday
night -- and now the chairman has torn it up.

ENGLAND, bruised, battered, and not a little bewildered after their
Rugby World Cup semi-final mauling by the All Blacks on Sunday, will
seek to restore national pride, and avoid the necessity to qualify for
the 1999 tournament, when they take on France today in Pretoria.
The English came to South Africa with high hopes of repeating their
feat of reaching the final four years ago, but they stumbled in
spectacular fashion on the wrong end of a 45-29 drubbing in Cape Town.
There is still a sense of disbelief in the English camp as to how it
could all have gone wrong. Received wisdom now has it that it took the
England players nearly an hour before they got to grips with the pace of
the game and, thereafter, they played well.
They don't go quite so far as to suggest that, dammit all, they won
the last 10 minutes, but still they cannot see that their stolid,
yeoman-like style of play has been left behind in world terms.
That may be too unkind, because yesterday, England manager Jack Rowell
was conceding that, if they are to live with the Southern Hemisphere big
three -- and there were hints again yesterday that Twickenham sees this
as the way forward -- then maybe the English domestic game would have to
take a hard look at itself.
Be that as it may, England now have discovered that, while they might
be able to employ their physical superiority to bash and bully their way
to Five Nations' Championship success, such an approach will not wash on
the world stage.
Today at Loftus Versfeld, England face the old Five Nations' foe,
France, for the dubious honour of finishing third. But there is an added
edge to the play-off game this time, because of the ludicrous dictat by
the organisers that for 1999, all but the top three countries will have
to pre-qualify.
Such a notion, within the context of a tournament expanded to cater
for 20 competing nations -- as opposed to the 16 this time around --
might yet prove impossible to organise within the confines of an already
overcrowded international calendar, but, until the RWC authorities
backtrack, there is still a lot at stake today.
France have not beaten England since 1988 and, again as Rowell
conceded, so far as the Tricolours are concerned, the play-off game for
them will represent an ideal opportunity to stop the rot.
Today, France will field Franck Mesnel at fly-half in place of the
out-of-form Christophe Deylaud. Albert Cigana, who earns his first cap
aged 34, takes over from another veteran, Marc Cecillon, and loose-head
prop Louis Armary stands down in favour of Laurent Menezech. Otherwise,
France are as they were in defeat by South Africa last weekend.
England ''rest'' the shell-shocked Tony Underwood (you know when
you've been Lomu-ed), Ian Hunter being the replacement, and Steve Ojomoh
comes in for the injured Dean Richards.
Today's game will be the last for England's Dewi Morris, the Orrell
scrum half indicating that after the World Cup, he will hang up his
international boots.
Yesterday, Rowell said the selection of Mesnel indicated that France
intended playing a running game. ''Rob Andrew, who spent some time
playing in France, knows the French side and believes that they intend
to run it. Mesnel has been picked at fly-half and he is the kind of
player who can play the ball wide,'' said Rowell.
''If they get away to a good start, then you can be sure they will be
running it all over the place. France remain the best runners of the
ball in the world from broken-play situations.
''I am hoping that our lads are able to bounce back from events in
Cape Town on Sunday. It is still an important game and I'm sure that the
players can get themselves up for it.''
England -- M Catt (Bath); I Hunter (Northampton), J Guscott (Bath), W
Carling (Harlequins), captain, R Underwood (Leicester); R Andrew
(Wasps), D Morris (Orrell); J Leonard (Harlequins), B Moore

<HEADLINE>No early sale of Euro '96 tickets. Tartan army on short rations</HEADLINE>

THE SFA moved swiftly yesterday to ensure that tickets for the
European Championship finals next summer will not be sold north of the
Border without stringent security checks.
They were alerted by suggestions that tickets had already been sold to
thousands of members of the Tartan Army, who had applied directly to the
Euro '96 organisers in London, but last night the SFA's security chief,
David McLaren, said: ''I have spoken to the Football Association about
this matter and they have assured me that no tickets will be promised to
anyone living in Scotland.
''It is worrying to think that this might have happened or that it
might happen in the future and that is why I spoke to London
immediately. It would be a security nightmare if tickets were
distributed without proper checks.
''We recognise the problems which are liable to exist if we do qualify
because of the limits which will be placed on the ticket sales. We will
be limited to around 7000 tickets for the group games, although that
could rise if we are drawn against a country who might have a tiny
support.
''But we cannot risk fans going south without the security supervision
we feel necessary. There has to be segregation and there has to be
strict control over ticket sales. Today the FA have again given us
guarantees over both these very important matters.''
SFA chief executive Jim Farry added: ''It has been our understanding
all along that tickets for games will not be sold to supporters outside
England. That is something which was agreed with UEFA and the FA some
time ago.
''That has not changed. Nor will it. For the moment, vouchers have
been sent to supporters in England who want to buy tickets for the
finals.
''If we qualify, it will be much closer to the finals before we know
where we will play our games and then we will also learn what our
allocation of tickets will be.''
Last night a spokesman for the FA said: ''There is no way that we will
send tickets or vouchers outside England. Indeed, we are so conscious of
security that even for addresses in England we are asking the applicants
to state which country they will be supporting.
''We do know that Scots living down here may get their hands on some
tickets but none will be sent north of the Border from these offices.''
Only this week the Scottish clubs who will compete in Europe in the
new season were called to Park Gardens to have the security aspects
underlined.
Said Farry: ''We had these important talks with the clubs and I think
everyone knows our record on crowd behaviour at home and abroad and that
also applies to the national team and particularly to the finals in
England, if we get there.''
The SFA have indicated that members of their Travel Club will have
first option, followed by fans who attend the three qualifying matches
which will all be played at Hampden in the autumn.
* DUNDEE United have agreed to meet Rangers at Tannadice on Friday,
August 4, as part of the Ibrox club's build-up before their European Cup
tie on August 9.
Rangers will find out on July 12, when the draw is made, who they must
beat if they are to claim a place in the money-spinning Champions'
League.

TOTTENHAM yesterday joined in the ''lunacy'' of the transfer market,
buying Chris Armstrong for #4.5m -- then hit out at ''irresponsible''
rivals Arsenal for going into the red for Dennis Bergkamp.
Alan Sugar, the Tottenham chairman, hoping his purchase is the last of
the mega-money buys, wants the English FA to step in and regulate
transfer prices.
North London unveiled its second multi-million pound striker in
successive days as Tottenham followed up Arsenal's #7.5m purchase of
Bergkamp on Tuesday.
''I hope we've reached the end of this lunacy in transfer prices,''
said Sugar. ''It must stop after this Bergkamp deal. Even Manchester
United -- a club with financial clout but a properly run business
institution -- can't afford such irresponsible actions.''
Armstrong, 24 last Monday, is an England B internationalist who scored
eight Premiership goals last season and appears an acquisition of decent
potential in a team full of international talent.
But, after the player signed a four-year contract, Sugar called for a
sense of perspective to return to the transfer market.
''It's difficult to compete in the market place when irrational
amounts of money are being paid that don't make sense in respect of
clubs' balance sheets,'' he said.
''Clubs like Arsenal or Tottenham or Newcastle can't afford to pay
#10m for players -- it's a fact of life. With gate receipts, the amount
of money coming in from television, its just not enough for clubs to
keep their head above water let alone make profit. It's madness and it's
gone out of all proportion.
''I'm not having a go at any individual club but it can only bring
trouble down the line somewhere. If the Arsenal chairman admits he's got
to appease people by going into the red and getting himself into
financial trouble, then we are in a sorry world.
''Hopefully now we can get back to normality and the cheap transfers
of #2.5m.''

<HEADLINE>Hustlers try to create new image for boxer. Tyson works on role as Harlem's prodigal son</HEADLINE>

ABDUL Malik Aziz returned to his roots and walked among his own people
of Harlem, handing out cheques to under-privileged children as he went.
It was another stage of Mike Tyson's journey from prison back to boxing
and respectability.
The former heavy-weight champion of the world and convicted rapist
travelled to his native city of New York and was hailed as some kind of
Messiah as he spread greenbacks and the word of Allah.
Only in America could a black kid from the mean streets bludgeon his
way to the very top of the world, tumble in disgrace after having been
found guilty of the rape of a Miss Black America contestant, spend three
years behind bars, and emerge a more marketable proposition than ever
before.
That he found religion within the confines of his cell helps the sales
pitch. Tyson emerges from the shadow of evil; from fear to eternity. It
is all headline stuff and good headlines are what every boxer craves.
Cynical? Perhaps, but no-one can be sure of Tyson, who said during one
of his prison interviews that he had been too nice in the past. ''Now
Mike Tyson hates the world.''
It is too early to say yet whether an individual who seemed
custom-made to inflict punishment on others -- ''Every punch I throw has
bad intentions,'' he once said -- has seen the light, or whether it
suits the hustlers who control big-time boxing to have him talk of
things celestial. They lay in wait plotting the path of his return while
he paid his debt to society and every move Tyson makes will be for a
financial reason.
It didn't do George Foreman any harm to become a bible-thumper and in
a business peopled by crass, calculating hype merchants, a healthy
degree of cynicism is a must. At the top level boxing's managers and
promoters are adept at relieving the gullible of their money.
There wasn't exactly a ticker-tape parade for the ex-con the other
day, but he did receive a hero's welcome and his minders made sure he
would be shielded from questions relating to the rape of Desiree
Washington in Indianapolis in 1991. Tyson continues to maintain his
innocence, but the New York Post reported he has agreed to pay
Washington an undisclosed sum of money to drop the civil suit she has
filed against him.
The out-of-court deal averts a trial set for July 24 in Indianapolis.
The victim had sought punitive and compensatory damages for assault,
battery, false imprisonment, and emotional distress.
Emotion and admiration lapped around him at all four stops on his tour
through Harlem, where enthusiastic crowds braved hazy, 90-plus (above
32[DEG] Celsius) temperatures to cheer him. They pointed videocams and
Polaroids at him and many wore Tyson T-shirts.
His fans certainly haven't changed, but again the question must be
asked of him: ''Have you?''
''If I have, then I hope it is for the better,'' he replied.
The ''prodigal son'' -- as several speakers described him -- wore a
pristine white suit and started the day by meeting with local ministers.
It was over the top, but the vast majority of the congregation were not
there to question. They were in place to worship a hero.
Tyson then dropped into a soul food restaurant for a boxing news
conference -- he will begin his comeback to the ring with a low-key
undercard fight against Peter McNeeley on August 19 -- and spoke to his
fans outside the Apollo Theatre.
He gave out $200,000 for various social programs to start his new
charitable foundation and one cheque ($100,000) was made out to ''Our
Children's Foundation.'' Tyson also visited the charity's Harlem
offices, where children put on a homecoming show for him and hailed him
as a role model, tap-dancing to a song called ''The Mike Tyson Rap.''
A man with a penchant for hurting others and an emotional development
which lagged behind his physical maturity hardly seems the type on which
anyone would want to model their offspring, but this is America and, to
many blacks in a society which should have offered them more, Tyson
remains a champion.
However, preferring to use his Muslim name, Abdul Malik Aziz, he said:
''We as Muslims look at no-one but Allah as a role model.''
He then told his young audience: ''It is very vital that we understand
as individuals we all live, die, and make mistakes. I look at myself as
relatively nothing. I pray to Allah. The only benefit to my
incarceration was embracing Islam.''
Earlier in the day, hundreds of Harlemites waited for hours to see
their hero, turning a stretch of 125th Street into an impromptu block
party as a reggae band played. ''The powers that be didn't want you here
and didn't want me to speak to you,'' he announced. ''But we'll beat
them because God's on our side.''
Some in his home town were divided over whether to embrace or shun him
and a candlelight vigil for abused women, prompted by his return, was
held on Monday night. Viola Timbers, a clerk at a Harlem clothing store,
reflected the views of those at the vigil: ''I feel it's too early for a
celebration. He's only three months out of jail. We should wait a little
longer.''
Most, however, had rid themselves of all doubts about Tyson, if indeed
they ever had any. ''That's my man. I had to make sure I saw him,'' said
James Brown, who waited for four hours to get a 10-second peek at the
boxer outside Sylvia's restaurant. ''He looks a little sad, though.''
When Tyson appeared at the Rev Al Sharpton's office window, he raised
a clenched right fist, the crowd erupted into wild cheers. ''I'm glad
he's out,'' said Cecile Brent, a Harlem store worker. ''I feel we should
give him a chance. He did his time, and learned a lot while away.
Inevitably, the fighter was asked if he was sorry for the rape, but
boxing's larger-than-life promoter Don King shouted: ''Sorry for what?
Come on.''
Then, when Tyson was queried about his history of violence towards
black women, his manager, John Horne, yelled: ''Mike Tyson is not going
to sit up here and answer silly questions. I am not going to let him sit
here and be disrespected.''
Later, a black woman stood up and shouted: ''I just want you to know
that African-American women love you.''
He looked her way and said quietly: ''Thanks very much.''
The lisp was clearly audible, making him sound boyish, even innocent.
So, has Tyson been rehabilitated? Has he seen the error of his ways?
Only Allah knows.

THE Tour de France is slightly more than a week away, but mountain
king Robert Millar makes a flying visit to the Isle of Man tomorrow for
the British national championships.
The Scot will be lining up with fellow countrymen Brian Smith and
Graeme Obree in this tough event, which involves five circuits of the
tortuous TT circuit, a distance of 113 miles.
Millar has won the national title twice, but has not always competed
in this top event for British riders, much to the displeasure of the UK
Cycling Federation.
The current champion is Millar's close friend and former continental
rider, Brian Smith, now with Team Plymouth of America. Smith, who also
won the crown in 1989, will be defending the jersey in a race which is
packed with top English riders, including Chris Lillywhite, Mark
Walsham, Glen Holmes, Neil Hoban, and John Tanner.
However, if Millar turns on the form which he says has been slow in
coming this year, Smith could have a real fight on his hands. He has the
added support of his American squad who are also riding the Isle of Man
International which, for the first time, incorporates the British
championship.
Obree, as usual, has been captivating the fans with his performances
on the island, winning the mountain time trial on Sunday and a 25-mile
time trial on Tuesday. But road racing is not his strong point and he
will be using the occasion as part of his build-up to the world
championships in Colombia in October.
Millar blames his poor form on an abortive trip to Colombia early in
the season, when his team were checking out the course mainly for the
benefit of team-leader Luc Leblanc, who now is injured and also out of
form.
This must be one of the few occasions when three Scottish riders have
competed together in a national championship. A tartan triumph would be
just the tonic for everyone, particularly Millar on the eve of the
world's greatest race, Le Tour, which starts on July 1.

CAMERON Black was like a breath of fresh air when he won two butterfly
titles at the national championships in Edinburgh. The double, plus a
silver medal in the 50m free-style, earned Black a first Scottish team
selection for next month's training camp in France, plus a trip to the
Canadian championships.
Now the 17-year-old, who gave up a place at Dundee college to swim
full-time this season, has his sights focused on next year's Olympics.
''I'm delighted to make the Scottish team for a first time,'' said
Black, who lives in Carnoustie, ''In Canada, I want to break the
Scottish record in the 50m free-style and 100m butterfly.''
He started his career as a nine-year-old with Monifieth, but it was
his move to join coach Billy McGoldrick at Arbroath St Thomas four years
ago that sparked his rise to form.
Cameron's training schedule -- 22 hours a week in the pool plus three
weight sessions per week -- reflects his dedication. ''It is hard work,
but it has to be done, and I love getting the rewards in competition.''

THE New Zealand All Blacks have named an unchanged side from that
which beat England for the final of the Rugby World Cup against South
Africa on Saturday, and one of the team members is their devastating
find at stand-off, Andrew Mehrtens.
While the press conference was taking place to make the announcement,
Mehrtens was spending time coming to terms with it all in the warm
Johannesburg sun.
He looks like a young boy does Mehrtens, finely built with short,
blond hair and a ready smile. ''I suppose I am finding it hard to come
to terms with the magnitude of what is about to happen, with it being a
final against the South Africans,'' he says, relaxing as best he can.
''I am trying to switch off in as many ways as possible, but there's
no doubting that it's going to be the biggest game that I have ever
played in.''
That was a sentiment echoed by Sean Fitzpatrick at the press
conference, as the mood in the New Zealand camp has become far more
serious all of a sudden. Fitzpatrick said that the honour of leading a
New Zealand team out against the South Africans at Ellis Park could not
be underestimated.
''The guys who played in the 1987 final in New Zealand would say that
their game was just as important, but this is the biggest game for me,''
said the captain.
Much of the time and effort spent by the All Black squad is in
deflecting questions about the man Will Carling called a ''freak'' --
Jonah Lomu.
A local radio station has offered 5000 rand (almost #1000) to South
African rugby for every tackle put in on Lomu -- there was a whole TV
programme devoted to the subject the other night -- and the joke of
Jo'burg is that the only way to stop the mammoth winger may be to call
for O J Simpson. ''I take it that it was an Afrikaner radio station?''
asked Colin Meads at his most droll.
New Zealand officials yesterday hit out at the tackles-on-Lomu
publicity stunt by oil company Shell (South Africa). The All Blacks'
campaign manager Brian Lochore blasted: ''That is bordering on the
ridiculous. I hate to see rugby involved in that sort of carry-on.''
''Can't we talk about rugby,'' pleaded Laurie Mains, as yet another
questioner asked if it were true that Lomu had been offered mega-bucks
by the Dallas Cowboys. It was an American journalist who had flown in
for the event, too.
The Cowboys, as it turns out have denied any interest.
Mehrtens, meanwhile, suggests that there is much more to All Black
rugby than just one man. ''I think that our back division has been going
well. We don't lie as flat as the Aussies, in fact we don't think too
much about our alignment,'' he said with a disarming look.
''Instead, we concentrate on getting through the moves properly, but
as I have found out more often in this World Cup, I can call a move and
then the forwards take it on and things change. That's why we try to
play rugby.
''I think that we all know that for anyone to get the ball, not just
Jonah, the forwards have to win it, the half-backs have to transfer it,
and the centres have to create space. I am just one guy in a committed
team that is desperate to win this cup.''
Before this World Cup, few in the UK had heard of Andrew Mehrtens.
Born in Durban of New Zealand parents he has, like many an All Black and
a certain Scotsman called Sean Lineen, a proud rugby ancestry which
includes a grandfather who toured South Africa with the 1928 New Zealand
side and a father who was an All Black trialist.
Whatever, as I watched Mehrtens train with his team-mates on Tuesday
morning in an ultra-competitive environment, I noticed two things.
First, just as he has suggested in his games, he is electric on his
feet. He has the speed of a winger, and ripped yards off Marc Ellis in
one of the sprint races the team had. It brought back painful memories
of him striding round Scottish defenders in the quarter-final.
Secondly, despite the fresh face, bouncing stride, ready smile, and
the odd freckle, he has a fair bit of steel to him as well.
He crossed swords with Robin Brooke at training over some passage of
play in touch rugby -- the All Blacks play it with a purpose -- and
during what appeared to be a semi-serious altercation, it was patently
obvious that young Mehrtens wasn't for backing down. It was Brooke who
turned away from the argument in defeat.
The All Blacks have that little something about them, as we have all
said before. I asked Mehrtens what he thought about the South Africans
wearing the shoulder pads and he gave a very interesting answer. ''I
don't think that they should make all that much difference,'' he said.
''First of all, you have to get yourself into the position to make the
tackle, then you have to want to make the tackle, and only then do you
go into the tackle.
''Most of what makes tackling effective is the frame of mind of the
tackler, and if you haven't got that, then you aren't going to be helped
by having shoulder pads. Zinzan Brooke wears them, but that's his
choice. I won't be.''
Much of what happens in this massive game that awaits us on Saturday
will depend on how Graeme ''Grim'' Bachop and young Andrew Mehrtens link
at the heels of their All Black pack, how Mehrtens copes with his kicks
at goal, and how quickly the stand-off can bring his dynamic left
winger, Lomu, into the game with drastic effect.
A great deal rests on the shoulders of such a talent, and that talent
is sure to receive some attention from the South Africans.
I watched Mehrtens walk away for yet another team meeting. My
goodness, they make them young these days.

PATRICK Rafter lost his title in the second round of the Nottingham
Open Tennis Championship yesterday.
Now, the pin-up boy, tipped as the new Pat Cash when he reached the
last 16 of the Australian Open in January, has to come to terms with the
prospect of rebuilding his slumping career at the age of 22.
Rafter, who has crashed to sixtieth in the world rankings after
occupying a top-20 place less than a year ago, went out 6-2, 7-6 to
Argentina's Javier Frana.
Rafter's slump may serve as a warning to Britain's latest young hope,
Tim Henman, if he starts reaching the heights.
The Oxford player, who knocked out No.2-seeded Swede Jonas Bjorkman on
Monday for the best win of his career, can now earn his biggest prize
money after being given a free pass into the quarter-finals.
Henman, the British No.4, progressed as the lone home survivor among
eight entrants without hitting a ball when Czech rival Martin Damm
scratched with an injured shoulder. Henman takes on world No.45
Woodbridge today with nearly #10,000 at stake for reaching the
semi-finals.
Seven of the original eight seeds started yesterday's second round but
Chilean Marcelo Rios, the No.8, went out tamely in two sets to American
Tommy Ho whose fifth-seded compatriot Mal Washington suffered a surprise
2-6, 6-7 defeat by Japan's Shuzo Matsuoka.
The biggest blow to the seedings committee's plans was reserved until
late in the evening, however, when No.1 seed Thomas Enqvist fell prey to
Zimbabwe's Byron Black, who defeated the Swede 5-7, 6-3, 7-6.
* ORGANISERS of the Halle Open tournament in Germany, who have spent
millions modelling their new stadium and surface on Wimbledon, have come
under criticism from home player Michael Stich.
After battling back from one set down to beat Dutchman Sjeng Schalken
4-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the second round of the ATP tournament yesterday, Stich
hit out at the worn-looking grass on the centre court which has hampered
his preparations for next week's Wimbledon start.
''It is normal to get the odd bad bounce on a grass court but when you
miss the ball three times, it stops being fun,'' said the German, who
has described the surface as being ''a disaster''.
* MARTINA Navratilova hit back at Pat Cash yesterday, during the
Direct Line Insurance Championships at Eastbourne, over his outspoken
criticism of women's tennis.
Australian Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, dismissed the women's
game as ''crap'' in a television interview this week.
His comment clearly upset Navratilova who said: ''I just wish he'd
stop criticising us.
''We don't criticise the men. You don't trash someone just because
they are having a bad time at the moment.
''Maybe the French Open wasn't so great but these things go in peaks
and troughs. Right now we are trying to get out of a trough.''
Navratilova's retirement from singles, the enforced absence of Monica
Seles, and Jennifer Capriati's confused retreat from tennis has left the
women's game desperately short of top class performers.
''There is a shortage of superstars who can sell the sport,'' admitted
Navratilova. ''When you take away big names like those the sport becomes
a bit boring.'' Third-round results:
Y Basuki (Indonesia) beat Z Garrison-Jackson (USA) 5-7, 7-6, 6-2; L
McNeil (USA) beat H Sukova (Czech Republic) 7-5, 6-3; N Zvereva
(Belarus) 6-1, 6-4; K Date (Japan) beat P Shriver (USA) 7-5, 6-2; C
Rubin (USA) beat G Fernandez (USA) 6-4, 3-6, 6-1; C Singer (Germany)
beat B Schultz-McCarthy (Holland) 7-6, 6-3; N Tauziat (France) beat L
Raymond (USA) 6-3, 6-4; I Gorrochategui (Argentina) w.o. M
Werdel-Witmeyer (USA), scratched.

IF Greta Scacchi had her way the second film she has made for Merchant
Ivory, the film-making tandem who launched her career with Heat and Dust
in 1982, would not have been called Jefferson in Paris. Instead it would
have been called Cosway, after the woman she plays in the film, in which
she co-stars with Nick Nolte as Thomas Jefferson, author of the
Declaration of Independence, and later third President of the United
States.
In Paris, Jefferson met Maria Cosway, wife of the painter Richard
Cosway who was at the Bourbon court painting the royal family. Maria was
a remarkable woman. A painter in her own right she was also a musician,
wit and free spirit. The Cosway's marriage was less than perfect but
they made an effective couple.
Maria Cosway, half English, half Italian, was brought up in Florence
where her English father ran an hotel much favoured by the well-to-do
British on the Grand Tour. She showed a talent for art and studied
painting with Angelica Kaufman, but they had little money, and, after
her father died, the family returned to England with all hopes resting
on Maria making a good marriage.
It is a role Scacchi seizes with relish, creating a vibrant portrait
of a glamorous, independent woman who lived within, yet defied, the
conventions of the day.
''
0 She said she had been surprised when she saw the film how much had
been cut, because it meant the relationship between Jefferson and Maria
did not have the depth it was supposed to have.
''I am not criticising the film, but being defensive about Maria,''
she added. ''There were maybe a hundred men like Jefferson at the time,
but a woman like Maria was remarkable. After she fell out with her
husband she retired to Lodi in Italy, opened a school and spent 40 years
there as an educatrice. I went to Lodi. The school is still there. It
became a convent school after her death and the nuns ran it for the next
150 years until about 10 years ago when it became a state school. There
is still a room full of her writing -- she wrote to Jefferson, he wrote
to her. There are her manuscripts, her music (she wrote for the harp)
and the lyrics of her songs suggest she was in love with a man miles
away across the sea. I feel they were drawn to each other like a magnet.
It is wonderful to have this material to draw on.''
The film deals with Jefferson's time in Paris and his relationship
with the three women who dominated his life, of whom Maria is one. The
others were his daughter Martha, who, although she married and had 12
children, was his hostess for his lifetime, and his slave, Sally
Hemmings, who is shown in the film, and probably was if contemporary
reports are to be believed, his mistress.
Jefferson, devoted to the memory of his dead wife, vowed on her
deathbed never to marry again and his daughter became her substitute.
Sally, a half caste, was probably his dead wife's half sister -- he had
inherited her from his wife's family as was the custom with slaves. By
the time Jefferson returned to the United States, Maria had given up any
thoughts she may have had of leaving her husband for him, and had gone
to Italy. They corresponded passionately for the rest of their lives
about everything under the sun.
Playing a late-eighteenth-century lady presented Scacchi with some
problems. The hair styles were fiendishly elaborate, and not all of
those in the film are wigs. The basis is Scacchi's own long blonde hair.

A boring portrayal of Thomas Jefferson's time in Paris, a mob hit-man
with a liking for his victim, a high-camp comedy, growing pains in
Belgium, trouble for a new teacher, and Quentin Tarantino at his worst.
William Russell sees it all on the big screen
IT takes an alchemist of rare talent to turn gold into lead, yet that
usually skilled triumvirate, Merchant, Ivory and Jhabvala, have done so
with Jefferson in Paris. Their magic touch has deserted them with a
vengeance. How can one recommend a film about a deeply fascinating man
which proves deeply boring? This film contains several fine
performances, and the opulence of the production is something to marvel
at. Louis XV1's court is conjured up in all its decadent, self-indulgent
splendour, but it is also, for much of the time, deadly dull. The cons
do ultimately outweigh the pros, but the latter are substantial enough
to merit taking a look.
It covers the five years, 1784-89, Thomas Jefferson, third President
of the United States, spent in Paris as that country's ambassador. He
was an inventor, a scientist, a man of letters, and owner of a
plantation in Virginia. There has been some controversy in America
because the film states as fact that Jefferson had children by one of
his plantation slaves, Sally Hemmings. The allegation, made when he was
President, was never proven.
The relationship between Jefferson (an ill at ease Nick Nolte) and
Sally (a luminous, kittenish Thandie Newton) should have been the heart
of the story, yet it does not begin until almost three quarters of the
way through the film. This is perverse, because it opens with one of
Sally's descendants (James Earl Jones) telling her story to a
journalist. Then we move to Paris, to Jefferson's arrival at court, and
two other equally intriguing, but irrelevant stories begin. Sally's
story ends with her pregnancy, and Jefferson's return to America. What
happened next is left unclear.
A widower, who vowed to his wife on her death bed never to remarry,
Jefferson is looked after by their daughter, Martha (Gweneth Paltrow).
Although she later married a cousin and had 12 children, Martha remained
his hostess all his life and the hint of incestuous attraction is
certainly there as she vows to be faithful to him for ever, and resents
the other women in his life. Jefferson's affair with the painter, Maria
Cosway, (a beautiful performance by Greta Scacchi, which conveys her
appeal, sexual and intellectual, with great subtlety) is one of those
passionate friendships possible then with a married woman, although not
perhaps today.
The trouble is partly Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's script. Unsurpassed at
adaptions, she seems uneasy with an original story. Three story lines
are two too many. Director James Ivory has come a rare cropper, but some
people's failures are more interesting than other's successes.
In Killer, directed by Mark Malone, the oleaginous, sinister Anthony
LaPaglia plays a hit man for the Mob. A burnt out case, who questions
the meaning of his life, he is persuaded to do one last job by his
employer, Peter Boyle and lives to rue the decision. The 'hit', a
beautiful society woman, played by the underused, under-rated but very
sexy Mimi Rogers, a femme fatale in the Barbara Stanwyck mould, knows
she is to be killed. She also wants to die. When LaPaglia collects her
she invites him into her appartment and they have sex. She is playing a
game, but he falls in love. The ensuing long night, during which he
takes her to the New Jersey warehouse where he is to kill her, is full
of surprises.
Tank Girl, a silly piece of would-be high camp based on a sadistic
lesbian oriented comic strip, stars Lori Petty, as the near bald,
blonde, bovver booted, desert Amazon who has sex with kangaroos and
fights the inevitable sneering English villain, Malcolm McDowell, for
control of the world's water supplies.
The film is pretty awful and lacks the courage of its lesbian fantasy
origins. The Sexual Life of the Belgians, which does not have quite as
much sex as the title, or certificate implies, is an off-beat comedy
about a boy's growing pains proving that Belgians do have a sense of
humour, albeit a strange one. An out-of-the-ordinary
coming-to-terms-with-manhood, not to mention with women, tale it
continually astounds and frequently charms.
In Clockwork Mice, Ian Hart, a talented, diminutive actor with Clark
Gable ears, plays a new teacher at a special school who has trouble with
his rowdy pupils, and falls in love with a colleague, Catherine Russell.
The solution to the children's ills appears to be cross-country running,
although it doesn't stop one of them throwing himself in front of a
steam train. A good cast -- John Alderton, James Bolam, and Art Malik --
gets little to do.
As for Destiny Turns on the Radio -- the best thing to do would be to
turn the set off. Tarantino fans can see Quentin in an acting role as
the God of Gambling, -- he rises naked from a motel swimming pool -- in
this fantastical tale of heists and double crosses among thieves set in
Las Vegas. Luckily he is a director and writer too, or it would be back
to the video store.

THE Labour Party's Rolling Rose road show was parked in Parliament
Square earlier this week. There was wee Geordie Robertson, a shadow of a
Scottish Secretary, and Eric Milligan, our putative Provost, not to
mention local luvvies Russell Hunter and Una Maclean -- ''Tonee, how we
love ya'' -- preaching to the usual suspects sent round from Keir Hardie
House, plus a sprinkling of bemused tourists.
''Are they selling roses?'' inquired an American lady. No, no,
membership my dear, and if you take my advice you will purchase a card
for every one of your family. The days of wine and roses are just around
the corner -- buy now to avoid a spell on the dole.
Be fair, this is the new Labour Party -- no connections with any
previous organisation of the same name, never heard of nationalisation.
Neil who? Yes, I know, but as someone who sees their activists most days
of the week they look, and behave, much the same way as they always did.
George Robertson is still determined to fix the size of the Scottish
Parliament so that his party has an overall majority; Eric Milligan
remains a dogmatic, if genial, centralist who hates the whole idea of
devolution. The first meeting of the new unitary council in Edinburgh
had barely ended when one of the ruling Labour administration was
confiding to me: ''This is the worst group I have ever been in.''
The bent, the backstabbers, and the bores were each pointed out. If
you want to know how Labour would like to run Scotland, take a peek at
the plans for the '''revamped'' Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities. I doubt if there will be a single Conservative councillor
on the main body, while the Liberals and SNP will both be
under-represented.
Incredibly, this is the organisation the Secretary of State believes
should fix the level of responsibility allowances in the new councils.
Would it not be easier for the Government simply to write a cheque to
the Labour Party, Ian?
Hang on, the Tory Party in government has hardly scented the air with
carbolic. What about the sleaze in your own ranks? Yes, I have been
frankly appalled at the antics of some of our honourable members of
Parliament in recent times. Those who took money for asking questions in
the House should have been drummed out the moment they were discovered.
The sight of ex-Ministers racing into boardrooms of companies they
helped to privatise has scandalised the nation. The salaries of the fat
cats in the previously public utilities has been a sickening example of
collective greed. I have consistently condemned such behaviour.
All I am telling you now is, if you believe the Labour Party is likely
to behave any better, you will be gravely disappointed. The body politic
in this country is decidely sick. There are many reasons for that -- the
archaic structure of our democracy; the lack of accountability at local
government level; the growing sense of detachment from politics by so
many members of the public; the feeling, expressed in every corner of
the land, that ''they are all the same, in it for what they can get''.
Sadly, the Nolan Committee proved that was not far from the case. I
used to think that compulsory voting, as they have in Australia, was an
absurd imposition on a mature democracy: surely one has the right to
stay at home. Now, when I see local government turnouts of 30%, and more
than half the electorate ignoring parliamentary by-elections, I am not
so sure.
We all have responsibilities to our country and to society as a whole.
If we do not like any of the candidates on the ballot paper, maybe we
should have to record that fact; maybe we should stand ourselves.
It cannot be healthy when politicians are held in the same esteem, or
lower, than petty criminals; unless all parties realise that, further
disillusionment is inevitable. Maybe we need a Nolan Committee, or
something very like it, to sit in permanent session, to examine the way
our MPs are remunerated.
I am told by many at Westminster that expenses abuses are endemic,
that many parliamentary ''fact-finding'' missions are little more than
paid holidays.
We most certainly require a local government ombudsman with greater
powers. It may have escaped your notice that the ruling Labour group on
Birmingham City Council this week has simply refused to accept the
ombudsman's report suggesting political favouritism in the awarding of
certain grants. Toothless tigers do not help the cause of clean
government.
Proportional representation, as I have argued for the past 15 years,
would help in that it would reduce the number of one-party
administrations. But that alone will not cure the cancer. There are
votes to be won for the party that is prepared to clean up its act. I do
not wish to see a thrashed Tory Party lurching to the right under Mr
Portillo -- that will do little good for Britain in the long term.
I do wish to be a member of a party which can look the public straight
in the eye. That probably means honest answers about where the party's
funding comes from; it definitely means a stricter code of ethics than
has prevailed in the present Parliament.
Monklands is the Labour Party's shame and, I suspect, not the only one
that will emerge in the next few years. Until Labour is prepared to tell
the British public how it intends to run the country, it is not fit for
office in any case.
But, if we have reached the stage where we do not trust any
politicians -- and that is what the opinion polls suggest -- what
exactly are we prepared to do about it?

IT IS now fairly clear why Jacques Chirac was so understanding of John
Major's domestic difficulties when the pair met recently. The new
President of the republic was about to acquire a heavy-duty public
relations problem of his own and needed, as politicians often do, just
precisely as many friends as he could get.
So it was that our Prime Minister could be found in the Commons this
week declaring that nuclear testing in the Pacific was a ''decision for
the French''. Meanwhile, in the Upper House, someone calling himself
Lord Henley, who turns out to be a very junior defence minister, was
refusing to rule out the possibility of Britain resuming testing in the
Nevada desert -- if the Americans, who are contemplating a few
detonations of their own, will allow it, of course.
Thus, anyone who imagined the nuclear arms race ended when the Soviet
Union was out-spent begins to understand that the new world order
differs from the old only in being bereft of sufficient targets. The
whiz-bangs remain, endlessly refined, vastly disproportionate to any
conceivable threat, and a standing invitation to grubby dictators
suffering from thermo-nuclear penis envy. All they need is a good enemy
to incinerate.
In all this, therefore, perhaps the least contentious thing you can
say about France's decision is that any device still not perfected after
190 attempts has probably disqualified itself as a design concept. The
only real surprise is that there is enough of Mururoa Atoll still intact
to allow the charmless French military to have its thrills.
What remains to be done, after all, to upgrade the Gallic deterrent
from ''moderately obscene'' to ''satisfyingly criminal''? To make the
technological leap from ''sincerely terrifying'' to ''wholly
genocidal''? Or is it just that a newly-elected right-wing politician
is, as tradition demands, paying his dues to the generals?
As is usual when the hunt is on for the better bang, we are assured
that no harm will come to anyone, anywhere, ever. The French have
everything under control, and we know this because they say so. For the
sake of la gloire -- last sighted when the Elysee was justifying the
murder of a Greenpeace activist in New Zealand -- and the right to look
America in the eye, the nations of the Pacific will be outraged and the
arms race refuelled.
Yet never fear: it is all perfectly safe. As Gareth Evans, Australia's
Foreign Minister, said earlier this week, if there was really no chance
of radioactive accidents or leakage, why can't the tests be held ''on a
farm in Provence or down a mineshaft in Picardie''? Mr Evans knew the
answer when he asked, of course. The good people of France are as keen
on their force de frappe as the next patriot, but they prefer not to see
it on their own doorstep. That's why the Lord made colonies, surely?
Perhaps the most offensive thing about the French decision is that it
is being presented as some sort of necessary preparation for a
comprehensive test ban treaty which will be achieved, we are assured, in
Geneva next year. Like the alcoholic who swears he will stop boozing
right after his next drink, France (with China) is about to take the
pledge.
This is, along with most things associated with nuclear politics, a
lie. Already the US is making noises to the effect that, irrespective of
the meanings of the words ''comprehensive'' and ''ban'', limited testing
(limited to the number of times the Pentagon feels is right) will still
be necessary after 1996.
The five nuclear powers, making the rules in order to break them, must
be able, says the doublespeak, ''to maintain the integrity of their
nuclear stockpiles''. The reality is that until recently the Americans
had spoken only of small-scale tests.
This week Defence Secretary William Perry raised the possibility of
underground experiments using large yields, from ''a few pounds to
several hundred tons''. So the game begins again, and the fact that the
achievement of an effective test ban treaty was one of the planks of
Clinton's presidential campaign is quietly forgotten.
It is instructive to contrast these lunatic theatricals with other
aspects of Western defence policy. At present, for example, there is a
low-level row going on over who is to pay for the British and French
reinforcements despatched to Bosnia.
Having gouged much of the cost of the Gulf war out of Germany and
Japan, and having insisted for three years that something must be done
about the Balkans, the US is now refusing to make a contribution to the
cost of salvaging something from the debacle. Plainly, this is what
allies are for. Yet when it comes to nuclear weapons, neither Britain,
France, nor the US encounters any difficulty. Stop only to recall the
millions wasted on ''cost overruns'' in the construction of a lift to
haul Trident boats out of the Clyde, never mind the cost of the damnable
things themselves, and you realise that nuclear vanity defies the laws
of economics.
But would Britain's ''independent'' deterrent ever be used without
American agreement? Against whom would it be used, and for what purpose?
The French say an absolutely final series of tests is needed to
modernise their nuclear strike-force. For what? To take out Bulgarian
wine growers and Danish cheese-makers?
One final question: how does the modern, ethical,
environmentally-friendly Labour Party now preparing for government
square its support for the Brent Spar campaign with its continuing
espousal of the vile, expensive, and lethal pollutant called Trident?

AHEAD of next year's Inter-Governmental Conference on closer European
integration, the debate on the pro and cons of Britain participating in
EMU is hotting up. The views of the Euro-sceptics have been well aired
but recently the pro-European lobby has begun to make its case.
Frankly, if we are to stay in the EU it's about time we heard what
some of the benefits are. It is a shame that it appears impossible for
the nations of Europe just to exist in a loose free-trade relationship.
Those involved in matters European are largely of the opinion that it is
not possible to have the benefits of closer European trading ties while
eschewing political and monetary union.
Britain no longer has an empire and as such has to trade where and
with whom it can. Although markets are opening up around the globe,
Britain depends on Europe, and in particular Germany, for jobs and
prosperity. The importance of Europe as a market for British goods has
risen steadily over the years. The EU took 53% of our visible exports in
1994, 58% including Austria, Finland, and Sweden, compared with 36% in
1973.
Certain sectors of the British economy have done particularly well,
such as electronics. Samsung is investing #600m in a new multi-product
industrial complex in Teesside, creating 3000 new jobs. Over the past
decade the volume of cars made in the UK has increased by 51% and
exports to the EU have grown by nearly 400%. UK financial and other
business services have tripled their trade surplus with the rest of
Europe from #1000m in 1983 to #3000m in 1993.
Europe is but one trade bloc in a world which is full of nations keen
to establish formal trading zones such as north America with its
free-trade agreement, co-operative trade deals also exist in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
While Britain remains a partner, albeit a cautious one, in Europe, the
UK will continue to act as a magnet for overseas investment. Companies
in countries such as America and Japan use Britain as a gateway to
Europe for their goods. The UK's stock of inward investment rose from
nearly #52bn in 1986 to #131bn in 1993. It is estimated that inward
investment has brought over 700,000 jobs to the UK since 1979, directly
or indirectly. In 1992, the UK attracted 44% of all total direct
investments into the EU.
IT IS important that British business has a wider horizon. The
attractive growth markets for the future, albeit often more risky than
Europe, are in Asia and the Far East. Many large companies are actively
seeking opportunities in emerging markets in Latin America and the
Asia/Pacific region.
If we are to remain in Europe then it would be best to try to ensure
European legislation is passed which is in our best interests. Certain
areas are crying out for reform, not least the Common Agricultural
Policy. This, along with other forms of anti-competitive subsidies,
needs to be looked at, a point raised earlier this week in a European
policy document published by the CBI entitled Shaping the future -- A
Europe that Works.
It strikes me there are probably more similarities than differences
between the European nations, particularly those in the north such as
Britain, France, Germany, and the Benelux. Certainly they share many of
the same social and economic issues such as how to tackle unemployment
in the face of mounting competition from cheaper labour in emerging
markets and how to fund the welfare state amid an ageing population.
There is undoubtedly scope for a greater and better understanding
between the governments and peoples of Britain and Germany. As Giles
Radice, the Labour MP and expert on European affairs, points out in his
book *The New Germans, the Anglo-German antagonism which was so harmful
to the peace of Europe in the first half of the twentieth century, is of
relatively recent origin.
Today, Germany is not only Britain's NATO ally and fellow member of
the EU but is also its chief trading partner. In 1993, Germamy accounted
for 14% of British trade. Germany is also one of the largest investors
in Britain with 1,000 German firms located here, creating 100,000 jobs
directly and 120,000 indirectly.
Against this background there is a striking economic and political
case for a warmer relationship between Germany and Britain. In addition
it would create a better balance within the EU which currently is too
dependent on the Franco-German axis. It remains to be seen who in the UK
will take up this challenge. It could be that it suits certain of our
politicians to ignore some of the positive attributes of modern Germany,
notably in the industrial and environmental fields, in favour of more
tabloidesque prejudice.
* The New Germans by Giles Radice is published by Michael Joseph,
price #16.50.

IT IS to be wondered if Robinson Crusoe still forms part of the staple
diet of youthful reading. It was not the first novel in the English
language, of course, although many believe it to be the first great one.
Adult fascination with Crusoe's plight is shown by the popularity of
Desert Island Discs, and the luxuries celebrities choose to mitigate
their isolation. Crusoe, as we recall, had to wait some 20 years before
seeing a human footprint in the sands. When companionship did turn up in
the shape of Man Friday, alas, it came with canoe-loads of dangerous
cannibals. So island life does have its downside, even without the risks
of toothache, appendicitis, etc.
This may explain the asking price of only #80,000 for Texa, the small
island just off the southern coast of Islay. The Scottish Office says
the new owner, if he takes up solitary residence, will become Scotland's
seventh island hermit. It will be interesting to see if anyone takes up
the challenge. The National Trust for England and Wales even had
difficulty in finding a hermit for its gardens at Stowe. All the hermit
had to do, as in the days when Gothic ruins were popular, was to sit in
his cell, compose poems, and engage in theological discussions. There
was even a supply of bread and wine promised.
Whether the modern generation could cope with solitary life is open to
question. According to a recent report, children as young as two are
watching television for up to 18 hours a week, and TV is not only
treated as an ''electronic baby-sitter'' but is accepted by the
youngsters as adequate company.

MEL Neef, who runs the individual 400 metres this weekend for Britain
at the Europa Cup final in Lille, tops the early season Scottish
rankings at 100 and 200m as well as her specialty. Hopefully, after this
weekend's national championships at Meadowbank, the lists will require
radical upgrading.
Aileen McGillivray is tackling the 100m and 200m -- a double she
achieved only once before, and having recovered from gastric problems,
is capable of removing Neef's name from the top of the list at the
shorter distance.
The leading performances at 800m, 1500m, and 3000m all have been
achieved by athletes competing overseas. Mary McClung, last season's
Scottish 800m champion, clocked her time at university in the USA, while
the top times at the longer distance show a welcome return by Fifer
Karen Hargrave.
She has not shown any significant form since the 1990 Commonwealth
Games, where she finished fourth in the 3000m.
The poverty at 800m and 1500m explains why SAF has launched an
improvement initiative, steered by national coach Andy Vince and Carol
Sharp.
In 1970, there were 20 performances of 2-10 or better by six Scottish
athletes, and two sub 4-30 women at 1500. Three Commonwealth Games
later, in 1982, 14 Scots ran 2-10 or better, and 18 (the slowest of whom
was Hargrave) 4-30 or better at the longer distance. Last year, another
Games summer, just five athletes broke 2-10, and five were under 4-30.
Of the 11 other events, the national rankings are led by either
foreign athletes (Liz Reilly, 10,000m) or competitors from outside
Scotland. Encouraging, however, is the number of competitors of 20 and
under who feature in the lists, especially in jumps and throws.

THE European Commission will now push for an international ban on the
dumping of offshore oil installations at sea. Another Brussels battle
with the British Government appears in prospect.
While British ministers were attacking Shell's U-turn, Mrs Ritt
Bjerregaard, EC Environment Commissioner, hailed it as a ''great victory
for the environment''.
She pointed out that the commission had always held the view that the
Brent Spar should be dismantled on land. ''The Brent Spar case shows
that it helps to fight,'' Bjerregaard said.
Earlier this month the commission made its anti-dumping views clear,
and subsequently voiced support at the North Sea conference for a
complete ban on the practice.
Bjerregaard has vowed to examine ''ways to move further in the
direction of an international ban on dumping of offshore installations
in the open sea.'' And she declared: ''We shall never accept any dumping
of oil installations in the sea.'' The widespread protests from EU
citizens were a clear signal to politicians to act immediately, she
added.
Ken Collins, Labour Euro-MP for Strathclyde East, who chairs the
European parliament's environment committee, said: ''I am very pleased.
I think Shell made the right decision. It is a great pity they don't
have the support of the British Government.''
Collins suggested the Council of Ministers should now provide the
commission with a mandate for planning the ''proper'' disposal and
decommissioning of installations.
''This whole affair demonstrates clearly there is a problem which must
be solved, and it is not one which should be left to individual member
states,'' said Collins.
The most likely outcome of commission thinking would be a proposed
directive banning the sinking of any obsolete drilling or production
equipment. This could be resisted by the United Kingdom in the Council
of Ministers. But without significant support it could be out-voted on
the issue because environmental matters before the council are normally
subject to qualified majority voting.
Moreover, voting procedures would depend on the legal base chosen by
the commission for producing a draft directive.
One British official said: ''Mrs Bjerregaard has been making
statements on her own without waiting for an agreed commission view. If
she comes forward with proposals we shall first have to examine the
legal base. It is worth remembering that we are also signatories to a
set of conventions relating to the offshore oil affairs. Shell's
original proposal for disposing of the Brent Spar was perfectly in line
with these conventions.
''We would have doubts about whether there is any need for EU action
in this area.''
Possible future moves by the commission could involve EU-member states
having to clean up existing pollution on the sea-bed in oil fields. This
could have major implications for the wreck of the Piper Alpha platform,
which still lies at the bottom of the North Sea.
A commission spokesman claimed it was possible this subject could come
up for discussion, but that so far there was no move to seek new rules
for existing offshore oil-industry debris.

JOHN MAJOR has been publicly humiliated by a British company he risked
his already battered political reputation to defend, and has every right
to be hopping mad. Faced with environmental blackmail and a personal
appeal from an angry German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, he backed Shell's
plan to sink Brent Spar only to be scuttled without so much as a
warning.
Last night's belated apology from Shell regretting the ''position in
which the outcome of this complex issue placed you and your ministerial
colleagues'' will do little to ease the sense of betrayal. For Major the
damage has been done; all that remains to decide is who picks up the
bill and whose beach gets Brent Spar.
Ironically, the fate of the 150-metre deep installation was sealed
months ago, with little or no political fall-out. Until last week the
debate over the oil company's decision to sink the installation rather
than dismantle it had remained safely on the eco-fringes; scenes of
fearless Greenpeace activists playing hide and seek with sheriff's
officers on Brent Spar's helicopter deck made for good television, but
were nothing for Major to worry about.
Then came the Germans. Environmental issues have a far greater
political importance in a country where the Green party remains a potent
force. On the eve of the Group of Seven summit in Nova Scotia last week
Kohl told German television he was not happy with the decision to sink
the Brent Spar. Hours later, on arriving in Halifax in the middle of the
night, he hinted broadly that he might raise the matter with his British
counterpart.
His remarks were sensational, the international diplomacy equivalent
of a shot across the bows. With the green light given for attacks on
Britain, his Ministers piled in. Britain's refusal to block Shell's move
was ''intolerable'' and ''unacceptable'' behaviour. German officials
warned the issue might arise in what they euphemistically called the
summit's ''periphery''.
And it did, on the edges of the first plenary session of finance
ministers. While everyone milled about, German finance minister Theo
Waigel pounced on Treasury minister Anthony Nelson -- deputising for
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke -- and told him Shell's actions made a mockery
of international efforts to protect the environment. It was a brief but
devastating dressing-down, and out of keeping with the congenial
atmosphere of like-minded allies agreeing on how to put the world to
rights.
Then came Major's turn. On day two of the summit Kohl strolled up to
the Prime Minister after one of their plenary sessions and had a brief
word. He expressed his dismay at Britain's support for Shell. Major
replied that the British Government was satisfied that Brent Spar was
being disposed in the most logical way possible, and in accordance with
international agreements. Later he tried to make light of what to
everyone else was a diplomatic embarrassment: ''Even the best of friends
disagree.''
Britain's ''best friend'' had in fact landed Major in a political
mess. Brent Spar, coupled with the greater furore over his leadership,
ensured that his every appearance in Halifax was dominated by domestic
matters. Throughout, he remained resolute in his support for Shell and
remained adamant that dismantling Brent Spar would cost more and do more
damage than dropping it in more than 2000 metres of North Atlantic.
The emotion of the campaign led by Greenpeace, and a boycott of its
products that has spread through much of northern Europe, proved too
much for Shell. Its image mattered more than its obligation to the
government that had defended its interests.
Yesterday Downing Street made no attempt to hide the damage, or its
belief that when cost and environmental effects are balanced, sinking
remains the best option. Major's aides were happy to relate what the
Prime Minister thinks of it all: Shell were ''wimps'' to cave in to
blackmail from Chancellor Kohl.
According to Energy Minister Tim Eggar, the Government will not pay
the excess cost of disposal on shore rather than at sea. Oil companies
can usually claim a tax refund for up to 70% of the cost. He also warned
that Shell would need to work for its licence to dismantle Brent Spar on
shore. All this amounts to retaliation: there is a price for saving
face, and the Government will want to make Shell pay it.
Major's difficulty is the growing strength of single-issue pressure
groups exercising power without responsibility. As Prime Minister his
job is to make difficult decisions based on conflicting interests, in
this case the health of a small patch of a large ocean compared with the
health of whichever stretch of the British -- or Scottish -- coast that
will be asked to welcome Brent Spar, oversee its rather dangerous
dismantling, and store its wastes.
And he must also take into account the cost to the taxpayer of such an
exercise, a cost which is likely to be repeated as other ageing North
Sea installations reach the end of their shelf-life.
Politically, Brent Spar is no more devastating a set-back for Major
than those that have preceded it. It will add to the sense of a
Government adrift, dangerously at odds with popular and international
opinion. But Major will be entitled to ask if public opinion has not
lost track of what governing is all about: making difficult decisions
and often choosing the lesser of two evils.
Unless the Opposition is prepared to volunteer a British town to host
Brent Spar, it must admit that it would have made the same decision.
Above all, Major's anger shows he knows the ultimate truth about this
mess: Germany, Denmark, Greenpeace and the others who have rejoiced in
pointing out the problem are unlikely to volunteer to be part of the
solution.

WHEN Carl Hooper edged Devon Malcolm to Graham Thorpe at slip for a
first-ball duck in the first Test at Headingley, there were those who
shook their heads and looked around with that ''told you so'' expression
on their faces.
Hooper may have been a veteran of 47 Tests, but topping the order was,
and looked, a whole different ball game to him. However, by the time the
West Indies had wrapped up the opening rubber by nine wickets, the
right-hander from Guyana had altered a few opinions, as well as some
bowlers' averages.
Following on from fellow opener Sherwin Campbell's half-ton in the
first innings, Hooper batted with style and no little aggression in the
second knock, clubbing nine 4s and four 6s in his unbeaten 74.
With the second Test at Lord's beginning today, 28-year-old Hooper is
confident of being among the runs again.
''It was different opening, because it is a specialist position. But I
didn't have any disagreement about the change. Someone has to do it.
''I think it would have been more of a problem maybe if I had just
come straight in as opener, without any experience of the English
conditions.''
Hooper, who has been on Kent's payroll in recent years, continued:
''The new ball does seam a bit more, and can move in the air more. That
has caught out a lot of batsman in the past who are not used to the
conditions over here.
''The bowlers do have a bit of an advantage early on, but you have to
take the initiative.
''Facing the new ball, there are more fielders close to the bat. But
that also means that there are more spaces to hit the ball through.
''Just now, I'm trying to concentrate on the gaps, rather than how
many slips are behind.
''At Test level, opening bowlers tend to keep it more or less in the
right place. But every bowler, no matter how good he is, will bowl the
odd 'Jaffa' -- and it's just a matter of picking those and hitting them
into the spaces that are there.''
He added: ''The runs I made in the second innings at Leeds were
important, for the side to win the match, and for me.
''The last thing I wanted was another failure. But the runs had to be
made. No bowler bowls to give you runs.
''The pressure was on, and I'm glad the way I responded to that
test.''
England, too, have to respond to failure this time around.
After the last contest, chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth stated
that there was a ''very fine margin between success and failure'' and
that ''not a great deal of improvement'' was needed to turn England's
fortunes.
Illingworth has done his bit of fine-tuning -- or major surgery,
depending on one's thinking -- by opening again with Alec Stewart and
restoring Robin Smith to the middle order.
Illy may have demanded five bowlers, but the West Indies -- though
down on the firepower they possessed a decade ago -- will persist with
four quickies, although they could be forced into one change.
Kenny Benjamin, their fourth seamer during the first Test, is still
struggling with a side injury, while next-in-line Winston Benjamin has
hamstring and knee problems. That could leave the way open for Ottis
Gibson to make his Test debut.
England (from): Atherton, Stewart, Hick, Thorpe, Smith, Ramprakash,
Cork, Gough, DeFreitas, Martin, Illingworth, Fraser.
West Indies (probable): Hooper, Campbell, Lara, Adams, Richardson,
Arthurton, Murray, Gibson, Bishop, Ambrose, Walsh.

BRITISH taxpayers could end up facing a bill for an additional #25m
following the decision to decommission Brent Spar onshore rather than
dump it at sea, unless Tim Eggar maintains his refusal to pay the
difference.
The onshore option will cost at least four times as much and with oil
companies able to defray a large part of abandonment costs against tax
the Government would lose a corresponding amount of revenue.
But Eggar said yesterday that taxpayers would not foot the extra cost
of breaking up the installation on land, and threatened to block a
licence for the work to be done on British soil.
Shell estimates that onshore disposal will cost #46m, although some
industry sources believe this could rise to as much as #50m.
Professor Alex Kemp, of Aberdeen University, an acknowledged expert on
the offshore tax structure, said yesterday: ''The essential point is
that abandonment costs are deductible for purposes of petroleum revenue
tax and corporation tax and to a limited extent for royalty tax.
''In this case the overall rate of relief for all the taxes would be
in excess of 70%. As I understand it, onshore disposal costs are up to
four times as great as deep sea dumping and the taxpayer is going to
have to bear quite a share of the increased costs.''
Professor Kemp said he thought it was very unfortunate that decisions
were being made on emotional grounds rather than on the basis of proper
cost-benefit analysis.

BRITAIN'S European Cup team was hit by three punishing blows yesterday
when Yvonne Murray, Colin Jackson, and Du'aine Ladejo withdrew from the
contest in Lille this weekend.
Murray, named captain of the women's squad in the absence of the
injured Sally Gunnell, is out of the 5000 metres after having suffered a
knee problem.
Neither the Commonwealth champion, nor her coach Tom Boyle, could be
contacted last night. The absence of Murray, who trained last week
without trouble, is understood to be precautionary, to protect her
season, rather than a response to serious injury.
Jackson would have faced Germany's Florian Schwarthoff, the European
110m hurdles silver medallist who has beaten him twice in the past 10
days, but the Welshman has pulled out because of tonsillitis.
The first-choice replacement, Tony Jarrett, who would have had every
chance of retaining maximum points, is injured, so head coach Malcolm
Arnold has turned to Wolverhampton's Andy Tulloch.
Murray, who, like Jackson, was unfit for last year's competition, is
replaced by Commonwealth 3000m bronze medallist Alison Wyeth.
Ladejo, the European 400m champion, who lost the individual place to
in-form Mark Richardson, is out of the 4x400m relay.
* EDINBURGH, led by a double from Gillian Stewart who won the senior
girls' 80m hurdles (11.9sec) and long jump (5.19m), won the quaich for
their overall team victory in yesterday's TSB Scottish Schools
Inter-Area match at Grangemouth.
Richard McDonald won the senior boys' 800m in a personal best of 1min
59.6sec and completed an unusual double with a win in the triple jump
(12.95m) to lead Tayside to their first success in the boys' team
championship. Results:
Boys: Team -- 1, Tayside, 72; 2, Fife, 70; 3, North of Scotland, 65.
Girls: Team -- 1, Edinburgh, 97; 2, Tayside, 68[1/2]; 3, Fife, 63.
Combined -- 1, Edinburgh, 147; 2, Tayside, 140[1/2]; 3, Fife, 133, 4;
North, 124; 5, Glasgow, 102; 6, Dunbartonshire, 99.
* SHETTLESTON'S John McKay, out of action for several months with an
Achilles tendon injury, made a successful return last night when he won
the Dalry 10km road race in Ayrshire, moving away in the last mile to
clock 31min 55sec. Tom Hearle (Kilbarchan) was second, 19 seconds
further back.

SCOTLAND have never beaten Russia in a women's international but they
squandered a great opportunity to rectify that situation in Amsterdam
last night in the European Nations' Cup after sweeping into a 2-0 lead
after just 12 minutes play.
Unfortunately, the Scots couldn't maintain that form and the Russians
drew level with two goals in the space of three minutes at the start of
the second half. In the end, Scotland could count themselves fortunate
to get 2-2 draw.
The point was good enough to give Scotland third place in the group
and a match with France, in a repeat of the final of the Inter-Nations
Cup in Singapore in 1992, in the classification matches to decide places
five to eight.
Susan MacDonald, with her thirty-ninth international goal, opened the
scoring in 10 minutes by reverse sticking the ball into goal after Susan
Fraser had found her with a superb through ball.
Two minutes later, MacDonald linked up with Wendy Fraser to set up
Rhona Simpson for arguably the best goal of the competition so far.
After the break the Russians hit back. Goalkeeper Tracey Robb stumbled
at a corner and a shot from Natalia Kravchenko slipped into goal at her
right-hand post.
Then three minutes later, Robb tried to intercept a through ball but
could only divert it into the path of Olga Lecks Ina and the teams were
level.

GREENPEACE, of course, would never have put oil installations in the
North Sea in the first place. Nevertheless, having been instrumental in
persuading Shell UK to abandon its plans to sink the Brent Spar in the
North Atlantic, Greenpeace was yesterday duty-bound to explain how it
would solve the problem of disposal.
Chris Rose, Greenpeace UK campaign programme director, said: ''First
of all we would take it and moor it in a Norwegian fjord, at the same
time negotiating with one of the engineering companies, such as Heerema,
the Dutch company which has just bought Swan Hunter. ''
A complete inventory of the chemicals and other materials on the Spar
would have to be done, said Rose, as Greenpeace doubted Shell's report
to the UK Government.
A specialist contractor, or a group of companies, would remove what
contaminants they could at sea and then repair any damage to the
structure to minimise the chances of failure while moving it. They
should then tow it into shallower water, remove the top of it, then tip
it sideways and tow it into port to be taken to bits.
Greenpeace then advocates that the industrial contaminants should be
cleaned out and sealed in cans and put in safe storage. After being
stripped, the steel structure would be recycled.

PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela is likely to attend Saturday RWC's final at
Ellis Park, Johannesburg, for a match which, according to Springbok
manager Morne du Plessis, will change the course of history in South
Africa.
The former Springbok captain said yesterday that for South Africa to
have reached the final was the biggest thing that had ever happened in
the sporting history of the country. ''It is the biggest thing
imaginable. In our long rugby history this will go down in folklore as
the moment when the course of history was changed.
''In a social context, too, I think anybody who has been here will
have noticed that it has been immense and we in rugby are very proud to
have been the catalyst for this focus on our country's nationhood. We
have all experienced that and there is now no question that rugby has
made a difference in this country.''
Du Plessis was ''not sure'' if Mandela would attend the final as he
did the opening ceremony. ''Let's just play it by ear. If it happens it
will happen spontaneously. Let's just let Saturday take its course, but
I'm sure that something will happen.''
Du Plessis added: ''This team has been through much together since the
start of the tournament. It is like a pro golfer who wins his first
competition and he says the monkey is off his back. Now, the monkey is
off our backs.''
Meanwhile, Springbok coach Kitch Christie sought to play down the
Jonah Lomu factor. ''Look, all you media guys are trying to make him out
to be a mountain or something. He's not. He's just a human being. He may
be a 20-stone human being, but at the end of the day he's just another
human being. He is awesome, but somebody has got to tackle him someday
and I think, I'm sure, that James Small will.''
Christie, the Transvaal coach who took over from the sacked Ian
McIntosh last year, said that success had come because he had been
allowed to choose the 26 players that he wanted. ''We have also done a
tremendous amount of work. We have gone back to basics and constructed
the whole thing over again. We took a lot of criticism over some of our
selections, but so far it seems to have worked.'' Teams:
South Africa -- Joubert; Small, Mulder, Le Roux, Williams; Stransky,
van der Westhuizen; Du Randt, Rossouw, Swart, Wiese, Strydom, Pienaar
(captain), Andrews, Kruger. Replacements -- Johnson, Venter, Roux,
Straeuli, Pagel, Drotske.
New Zealand -- G Osborne; J Wilson, F Bunce, W Little, J Lomu; A
Mehrtens, G Bachop; C Dowd, S Fitzpatrick (captain), O Brown, I Jones, R
Brooke, M Brewer, Z Brooke, J Kronfeld. Replacements -- M Ellis, S
Culhane, A Strachan, J Joseph, R Loe, N Hewitt.

SCOTTISH Pride directors have responded to a shareholders' group which
has tabled criticial motions for the company's annual general meeting
next month.
The signatories to the motions called for changes in the rules
concerning directors' share dealings and suggested that shares bought at
38p earlier this year (and which subsequently rose to more than 50p)
should be sold back to the company at 38p.
Lord Sanderson of Bowden, chairman of Scottish Pride, has now written
to all shareholders defending the directors' position. ''I believe in a
chairman owning a stake in the business which he leads,'' he said. He
and his family interests now control just under 139,000 shares.
''I have now established that stake. I see my shareholding -- and
those of other, executive directors -- as representative of our
confidence in the future of a business which I was honoured to be
invited to chair from vesting day on November 1 last year.''
Shares in Scottish Pride, formerly the retailing arm of the old
Scottish Milk Marketing Board, are traded on a matched bargain basis
through the company's stockbroker Allied Provincial Parsons Penney. The
majority of shareholders are dairy farmers who were allocated their
holdings pro-rata at the time of milk de-regulation when the company was
constituted as a plc.
Michael McCreath of Garlieston Home Farm, Newton Stewart, secretary of
the shareholders' association, said he had been told on a number of
occasions that although some people wanted to buy shares, no-one was
selling and prices were steady at 38p per share.
In a statement accompanying Lord Sanderson's letter the stockbroker
said the market in Scottish Pride shares tended to be ''illiquid'' and
patience was often required to complete an order. Transactions are dealt
with in chronological order -- subject to the price limits indicated by
a buyer. In addition, it pointed out, Scottish Pride directors had
placed themselves under a further restriction that any purchases by them
would only be completed after all other buying instructions had been
fulfilled in full.
Directors were not allowed to trade in shares for the first three
months of dealing. Since they had been able to to purchase, the
interests of existing and potential new shareholders were always placed
before theirs, the stockbroker added.
Scottish Pride has taken out an advertisement in this week's Scottish
Farmer magazine to explain its position, pointing out that the directors
have adopted the terms of the London Stock Exchange model code on
directors' share dealings.
Earlier this week Lord Sanderson, a former Scottish Office minister,
met representatives of the shareholders' association. He described the
meeting as constructive and said he had given assurances on the future
of the company's creameries.
He expressed concern that the present discord could upset major
customers and cause real commercial damage.
Mr McCreath said last night he had still to see details of Lord
Sanderson's written statement. He had, however, attended the meeting
with him but did not yet see any reason for withdrawing the resolutions
which had been submitted for the agm.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS are set to tackle the oil companies over other
issues, buoyed up by the Shell climbdown, according to Kevin Dunion,
director of Friends of the Earth Scotland. He said: ''Oil companies have
not played fair with the British environment. And their promotion of
diesel, for instance, as a green fuel is a green con.''
He argues that oil companies and the British Government are reluctant
to apply the ''precautionary principle'', which would prevent them from
taking action which might cause damage but has not yet been proved to be
damaging.
There are also likely to be renewed calls for environmental
assessments to be carried out by scientists who are seen to be
independent, rather than those who have been commissioned by either a
company or the Government.
In Scotland, the oil companies may face local opposition on other
counts -- where to put the waste generated at their refineries at, for
instance, Grangemouth.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research at Friends of the Earth Scotland,
predicts that the public may now become more aware that the oil industry
is ''a dirty business'' s.
He claims that super-unleaded petrol should be banned straight away
because of its high benzene content -- a chemical which, according to
the World Health Organisation, is carcinogenic.
There is new evidence of environmental damage around working oil rigs,
and a report by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory found that pollution from
vehicle exhausts in urban areas is stunting the growth of mussels along
Britain's North Sea coast.

THE astonishing rise to prominence of John Greaves on the domestic
professional circuit this season took a further giant step yesterday
when he took the first-round lead in the Sunderland of Scotland Masters
at Gleddoch with a seven-under-par 65 which equalled the course record.
In tieing the score Kevin Stables set during a pro-am in 1993, the
25-year-old Greaves recorded his first ever hole-in-one, firing a wedge
onto the water-guarded green at the 145-yard eighth, his penultimate
hole, and watching it slowly trickle into the cup.
To that eagle he happily added seven birdies, despite a treacherous
wind which whipped up over the Firth of Clyde in the afternoon. Greaves
could even afford two bogies, surprisingly at two of the par-3 holes, to
head the #22,500 Tartan Tour event.
Having already notched up four tournament victories this season, and
accumulated nearly #9000 in prize money, he was content to have scored
his inaugural ace and said: ''My boss has had about 20 of them, but that
is my first.''
Richard Walker of Wearside carded seven birdies thanks to some
precision iron play to tie with tournament favourite Colin Gillies and
Keith Baxter. They edged one clear of Lee Vannet, who posted five
birdies and a solitary bogey.
Defending champion Russell Weir slumped to a one-over-par 73. Leading
scores:
65 -- J Greaves (Glasgow). 67 -- C Gillies (Falkirk), R Walker
(Wearside), K Baxter (Buchanan Castle). 68 -- L Vannet (Carnoustie). 69
-- D McCallum (Paisley), S Raybould (Scarborough South Cliffe), D
Macpherson (Garforth GR), P Smith (Deeside), F Mann (Musselburgh), S
Crooks (Dyke), S Harrier (Craigie Hill), A McCloskey (Airdrie), B
Marchbank (unattached), E McIntosh (Braid Hills). 70 -- B Moffat (Jim
Farmer G&amp;L), L Batchelor (Rochester and Cobham Park), S Martin
(unattached), C Elliott (Dubai Creek), S Thompson (Gleddoch), K Campbell
(Machrihanish), S Edwards (Wrexham), C Lovie (Inverurie).
EAST Renfrewshire's Craig Watson begins a double agenda at Irvine
today in the first round of the Claremont Scottish Mid Amateur
championship.
The 28-year-old will be keen to produce a solid defence of the title
he won in the inaugural event at Blairgowrie last June as well as
continue to catch the eye of the Scottish selectors.
At the weekend the final stages of the championship will be run in
conjunction with the Scottish Youths' championship over the Bogside and
Ravenspark courses, the strokeplay tournament also being sponsored by
Claremont.
* STEPHEN Gallacher's victory in the Scottish Strokeplay championship
over the weekend has cemented his position in second spot in the latest
J&amp;B Order of Merit rankings behind Gordon Sherry. Leading positions:
1, G Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie) 788 points; 2, S Gallacher
(Bathgate) 644; 3, G Rankin (Palacerigg) 488; 4, S Mackenzie (West
Linton) 287; 5, B Howard (Cochrane Castle) 234; 6, A Turnbull
(Innerleithen) 224; 7, R Beames (Wick) 160; 8, C Watson (East
Renfrewshire) 130; 9, S Young (Inverallochy) 120; 10, R Clark (Erskine)
119.
* DUMBARTONSHIRE and Argyll retained the West Division Inter-County
title at Prestwick St Nicholas yesterday, when they defeated Ayrshire
5-4.They lost the foursomes 2-1 and four games in the singles were won
on the last green. Renfrewshire beat Lanarkshire 6-3.
In the East Divison at Dunfermline, Fife defeated East Lothian
6[1/2]-2[1/2] while Stirling and Clackmannan lost to Midlothian 5-4.

THE creation of a national reserve for milk quota which could be
allocated to people trying to break into the dairying sector was
advocated yesterday by Professor John Nix of Wye College, one of the
foremost farm management experts in the UK.
''Quota has become so expensive to lease it is beyond the capability
of any producer to get into dairying unless he wins the Lottery,'' he
added.
Professor Nix, one of the principal speakers at the European Holstein
Friesian Confederation conference at Peebles, spoke of the inexorable
growth in herd sizes, with the smaller operator being squeezed out. In
UK terms the average herd size has risen from 20 cows in 1960 to 67 last
year. The Scottish average is 91 compared to 71 in England and Wales and
42 in Northern Ireland.
The tendency towards bigger farms was one that would continue, he
said. ''If you only have 30, 40 or 50 cows, that isn't big enough for
the living people expect these days.'' He estimated a herd size of
between 60 and 70 was required to make a reasonable living.
His forecast was that numbers would keep drifting up, with a high
percentage of dairy units having 200 to 250 cows and three or four men
looking after them on a rota basis.
If the quota system was abolished it would enable people to come into
dairying but it would also make it possible for the big operators to
expand at a faster rate because they already had the capital and
efficient working systems, he acknowledged.
''I would like to have seen a reserve where people who wanted out
could sell back their quota at a modest price and it could be
redistributed,'' he said. ''It would let young blood in.''
Professor Nix recalled that the introduction of quotas had been
necessitated by over-production on a grand scale. The choice had been
quotas or a 20% price cut.
Despite quotas there could still be some trimming back of prices, said
Professor Michael Haines of the University of Wales. The Duke of
Westminster, who opened the conference, also warned that existing record
prices for milk could not last. ''We must be realistic that this
situation, we all know, is probably not sustainable in the longer
term,'' he said.
* THE Bruton Knowles National Quota Exchange was quoting 12.09p a
litre for leasing this week. The price for outright purchase was 59.94p.

1WITH the Admiral's Cup due to start at Cowes four weeks on Monday,
the Scottish challenge is in stormy waters.
The American boat, Numbers, which they had agreed to charter as a
condition of selection by the RORC, has been branded uncompetitive by
two leading designers, Tony Castro and Bill Tripp, and sponsorship
initiatives have brought no major backer.
''They have advised us that rather than bring Numbers over, we would
be better modifying our existing boat, Geronimo,'' said Steven Smith,
director of the Stirling-based company which is backing the attempt, and
the yacht's owner.
''We have placed their proposals for a new rudder design, and ballast
modifications, before the RORC, and hope they will accept it. But they
have other options, and may see this as an opportunity to scuttle us and
opt for an English boat.''
With a scarcity of viable International Measurement System craft, the
three-boat UK challenge could be heading for the the rocks.

INDICATIONS are that the British Wool Marketing Board's takeover bid
for the co-operative Scottish, English and Welsh Woolgrowers Ltd will
reach the 90% acceptance level, allowing the board to make a compulsory

* A PROVISION for a debt owed by the collapsed British Beef was
largely responsible for the fall in profits at Edinburgh-based livestock
auctioneer John Swan &amp; Sons in the year to end-April.
Pre-tax profits plunged from #376,898 to #204,933, hit by a #132,000
provision for the British Beef debt and a #32,000 charge for exceptional
property repairs. The total dividend is unchanged at 18.0p.
Swan said yesterday that, contrary to the national trend, the number
of stock handled had shown small increases. If this continued, and there
were no material falls in the value of stock, it said profits should
return to normal levels in the current year.

HAVING made a U-turn over how to dispose of Brent Spar, Shell is
facing a new set of problems.
The first is where the giant loading buoy will be berthed until a
decision is made on the second major problem: how the onshore
dismantling of the structure is to be carried out -- and where.
The Norwegian Government has offered to give the Brent Spar a safe
anchorage in one of its fjiords. This is an option Shell is likely to
accept as there are no sheltered anchorages in the UK where the
installation could lie safely during the winter storms.
Industry analysts believe decommissioning work could be done in the
UK, but this would entail turning the structure on its side because
there is not a suitable location in UK waters to allow the work to be
carried out while the installation is vertical
In addition, the workforce would face ''significant hazards''.
One independent feasibility report prepared for Shell UK suggested
that up-ending Brent Spar could cause ballast and storage tanks to
rupture.
The Norwegians took 10 days to turn the Brent Spar upright during
perfect weather in 1970, and damaged underwater sections doing so.
''It is believed that a similar condition would occur during reverse
up-ending, potentially leading to stability and control problems,'' says
the feasibility study.
Contaminated seawater now fills the six tanks that once held 300,000
barrels of oil. This would have to be pumped to a tanker via a barge,
and replaced with an inert mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
By controlling the rate of pumping, the Brent Spar would be slowly
toppled to a horizontal position.
Tony Mackay, of Mackay Consultants, said that once the installation
was on a barge there were plenty of locations in the UK where it could
be taken. Offshore construction yards would be very keen to secure the
dismantling work, he added.
The possibilities could include Nigg and Loch Kishorn, as well as the
ship-scrapping yard on the Firth of Forth, and the former Royal Navy
base at Lyness in Orkney.
''My understanding is that there are tonnes of oil sludge as well as
some other toxic materials, and these would have to be removed before
the dismantling work started,'' said Mackay. ''Where you dispose of
these toxic materials is another matter.''
He added that the Norwegians had made it clear that their policy of
disposing of their concrete oil platforms would be to remove any sludge
and toxic materials from the structures and then topple them in deep
water.
''That is what should have happened in the case of the Brent Spar,''
he said. ''If Shell had removed all the sludge and other material before
they started towing it to sink it, I don't think Greenpeace would have
been so concerned.''

By Our Political Staff
THE Cabinet yesterday shifted further towards a referendum on a single
currency after Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he saw an argument
for letting the country decide the future of the pound.
However in a key Commons debate on the European Union last night, an
appeal by Mr Hurd for feuding factions in the Tory Party to unite behind
the Prime Minister on Europe appeared to fall on deaf ears.
In a number of of interventions, Tory dissidents pressed the
Government to act on repatriating powers from the EU back to Britain.
As the Foreign Secretary set out his view at Westminster, Downing
Street officials reiterated that Mr Major had not excluded the
possibility of a nationwide vote, if and when the question of joining a
single currency arose.
The remarks increased expectation at Westminster that the Tories'
election manifesto will pledge that voters will decide the issue when
the time comes.
Mr Hurd -- addressing the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee four days
before EU leaders meet in France for their twice-yearly summit -- told
MPs: ''I personally am no friend of referenda.
''But I do see arguments for a referendum on this subject if the
British Government came to the conclusion that a single currency was in
the national interest. I do see a case for that, but that is a personal
view.''
Later, during the Commons debate, Mr Hurd warned Euro-sceptics against
retreating into a ''mood of sourness'' and said of Mr Major's policy:
''It may not be dramatic enough for all tastes -- it just happens to be
right.''
However, veteran Tory Euro-rebel Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East)
warned that Europe was ''going down the plughole economically and
politically'' and Britain should instead ''look out to the world'' --
seeking relations with countries which believed in free trade ''and
nothing else''.
He urged: ''What Britain should be seeking to do is to disengage so we
can pursue Conservative policies once again.''
Another Tory Euro-sceptic, Bill Cash (Stafford), said Britain might
have to leave the EU in 1996 or 1999 ''because the analysis leads us in
that direction''.
Mr Hurd told the Tory Euro-sceptics: ''To those of you who are clear
that we must establish clear blue water between the views of the
Opposition and the views of the Government on Europe, I would simply say
this: you have it.
''Read the Leader of the Opposition's speeches and those of the Prime
Minister.''
Mr Hurd insisted the argument within Europe was going Britain's way
with the ''dreaded F-word'' -- federalism -- now nowhere to be seen.
He rounded on critics of Mr Major including his predecessor, Baroness
Thatcher, mocking her famous stance of ''no,no, no'' to further
integration as being more like '''no, maybe, yes'.''
Shadow foreign secretary Robin Cook said the only ''clear blue water''
was between different strands of the Conservative Party.
He advised Tories: ''I think you should hold on to your Prime
Minister.
''He seems to be the only person in the party who can possibly span
the gulf you're opening up between yourselves over Europe''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Charles Kennedy said it would be better
the Tories split over Europe rather than remain divided within one
party.
The Government was caught in the headlights of its own backbenchers.
It was immobilised between pro-Europeans and Euro-sceptics ''and as long
as this goes on it is going to do British national interests severe
damage''.
Pro-European Tory Edwina Currie (Derbyshire South) said to jeers from
Tory Euro-sceptics: ''The EU is a world player of which we should be
thrilled to be a part.''
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, SNP victor at Perth and Kinross last month,
said in her maiden speech that the by-election had given the SNP a
chance to put forward ''our entirely positive vision of an independent
Scotland within Europe''.
She insisted: ''The message of this by-election is that it's time for
Britain to pull over, get out of the slow lane and let Scotland pass.''
Winding up for Labour, Joyce Quin said: ''I don't know much about
rugby but trying to stop European rifts and divisions in the Tory Party
seems to be like trying to tackle Jonah Lomu in a match against the All
Blacks.''
Replying, Foreign Office Minister of State David Davis dismissed calls
for Britain to withdraw from the EU, saying: ''We have never been
starry-eyed about Community membership. But the balance of interest
weighs heavily in favour of our membership.''
NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew last night told
dissident Tories to call off their plot to oust John Major -- and warned
they were endangering the Northern Ireland peace process.
Sir Patrick warmly praised the Prime Minister for his achievements in
Ulster, but said the advances could be put at risk by an autumn
leadership challenge.
He issued a blunt warning to Tory malcontents that they could
destabilise the historic peace process.
Progress in Ulster depended on a ''stable political base'', Sir
Patrick said in a letter in The Times.

MICHAEL TUMELTY finds the St Magnus Festival's ability to harness
local talent spellbinding.
INTEGRATION and involvement of community resources has long been a
feature of the St Magnus Festival. In fact the very first event last
Friday -- seems like weeks ago -- featured Orkney schoolchildren in a
fascinating music theatre piece adapted from Shakespeare's The Tempest.
This featured the full range of artistic expression -- song, dance,
speech, mime, shadow puppetry -- with music atmospherically performed by
the youngsters on a Javanese gamelan orchestra (borrowed from
Strathclyde), and the entire event topped off with an Indonesian snack
which featured a lethally searing, speech-numbing sauce. See St Magnus?
See the complete entertainment?
Still on the community front, there are a couple of debuts at this
year's festival. Yet to come -- as I write -- is the intriguing (and
first) festival appearance by Capercaillie, whose two concerts have been
sold out for months; intriguing because, for the first time, the folk
supergroup will find themselves working with an army of children -- a
choir and a fiddle orchestra. Not only that, but the combined forces
will all be involved in the premiere of a new, 17-minute work written by
a classical composer. See St Magnus? See cross-over?
One of the interesting questions about Orkney is this: who trains the
plethora of children who sing and learn instruments to such a high
degree? Where are they? Providing the answer -- and the missing link, as
it were -- at its inaugural concert in St Magnus Cathedral was the
Orkney Camerata, a small chamber orchestra (without as yet a double
bass) formed from professional players, music teachers, instrumental
instructors, and other advanced players living on the island.
This was an important and symbolic debut, because it is the intention
of this group to work in Orkney, through the year, and perform concerts
throughout the island . . . another missing link. The group is strongly
and positively led by Julia Robinson Dean, and has potential, to judge
from generally crisp, lively and well-driven performances of baroque
music. They will have to choose their repertoire carefully: their flank
was exposed with some extremely dodgy intonation and shaky ensemble when
they shifted to the more romantic territory of Grieg.
The flip side of all this, of course, and another intrinsic
characteristic of the St Magnus Festival, is the high-profile
performance of contemporary music. And, in all honesty, the pickings
this year have been a bit thin.
Best of the crop have been the two works of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies
-- his compelling, elegiac study for solo oboe, First Grace of Light,
performed in a recital by oboist Nicholas Daniel, and the superb
Carolissima Serenade, a beautifully crafted work of wit and affection
(with just a hint of the dark side), played the following night by the
Britten Sinfonia under conductor Nicholas Cleobury.
Other contemporary works in the Sinfonia's concert -- the meandering
and confused-sounding Deva by Nicola LeFanu, and Magnus Robb's Lios Mor,
irritatingly preoccupied with its own intertwinings -- were relatively
arid. They felt and sounded like intellectual exercises.

IT'S over 150 years since Giselle was first performed in Paris. The
inspiration behind it was a typical fiction of the times -- a
romantically supernatural tale of love unfulfilled where the hapless
maiden, having died unwed, rises nightly from her grave and (as a
wraith) dances in the lonely moonlight . . .
The eventual scenario grew to include earthly jealousies, betrayal and
madness but culminated in love reaching out from beyond the grave when
Giselle's spirit protects her duplicitous lover from the fatal wrath of
the vengeful wraiths. It was sentimental, spooky, and had a gorgeous
score by Adolphe Adam -- audiences were chilled and thrilled by it.
This London City Ballet version -- produced by Galina Samsova sticks
closely to the original script. Since Giselle is one of the most
abidingly popular ballets in any company repertoire you could argue that
it's a case of LCB leaving well alone.
Sadly, that's not strictly true. For even though there are some
resoundingly fine performances from the company, the piece as a whole
doesn't fire one's imagination or one's emotions.
There's no undertow of dramatic passion and, curiously, no sense of
inevitable, impending tragedy. Still, the dance itself proved worth the
watching. The wraiths were tellingly drilled into a handsome uniformity
that compensated for the lack of numbers that usually impresses.
Jane Sanig brought a brilliantlly hectic swiftness to her pale, shy
Giselle, really showing the steps to full advantage. Beverley Jane Fry
had dignity -- if not enough icy imperiousness -- as Myrtha -- while
Gary Shuker's athletic Hilarion didn't really deserve to lose out to
Roger Van Fleteren's lordly Albrecht.
Yes, in its setting and in its production, this Giselle looks old
fashioned -- but it is perfectly possible to overlook these weaknesses
and concentrate instead on the dancing of a hard-working young company
who really deserve better things to show off their mettle. Perhaps the
Gala Programme at the end of the week will fit that bill.

LIVERPOOL'S Cast currently seem to be the perennial support act,
cropping up on every tour and festival bill. However, they have much to
recommend them. Guitarist John Powers was a member of the La's, and
while his new outfit may lack Lee Mavers' occasional maverick genius,
they do possess a sound and consistency that suggests better billings in
the future, as long as they find the killer songs still not apparent in
their set.
In contrast, Weezer have the songs, but seem happy to under-achieve.
Entering to seventies disco strains, they seem content to goof around in
front of their authentically-antiquated amps before launching into
Jamie.
The opener is representative of much of their souped-up and
pre-packaged punk attitude. Lost among the feedback, barely-audible
vocals, and bursts of distortion, there's a near-classic pop song with a
brilliant hook and harmony.
Perhaps hampered by the pin through frontman Rivers Cuomo's broken leg
-- understandably, he spends a fair amount of time seated -- Tuesday's
show was a short and faceless experience in which Weezer ploughed
through their enticing debut album with little subtlety or guile. Paced
at a pedestrian level, interest was only stirred when songwriting
dexterity won out during the closing trio of My Sweater, Buddy Holly and
Jonas.
Weezer pale even in comparison to their nearest British equivalents,
Supergrass, who from similar influences and attitudes craft a more
appealing concoction. Weezer may be a temporary distraction for grungey
teenagers, but it's doubtful that anyone will remember much of this show
in six-months' time.

Clare Henry condemns the ungracious neglect of two sculptures -- a
big-hearted gift from kinetic artist George Rickey-- and urges Glasgow
to accept a generous offer which might help salvage its reputation in
the art world.
GLASGOW should be ashamed of itself. ''Thanks, but no thanks'' is bad
enough -- but: ''Thanks, we'll take your gift but mess it around and do
what we want with it,'' seems to be becoming a habit. Currently the
Burrell trustees are vigorously defending the terms of Sir William's
will, which the city fathers now want to overturn. ''The council cannot
accept gifts of this importance, and when it suits them, expect to vary
the terms,'' a senior Burrell trustee said recently.
George Rickey must sympathise. Famous worldwide for his kinetic
sculptures, the 88-year-old American born, Scottish-educated artist, who
grew up in Helensburgh, and whose stainless-steel mobiles sell for
around quarter of a million pounds, gave Glasgow two of his sculptures
after a successful exhibition in the city of his childhood in 1982.
It was a hugely generous gesture -- but Glasgow has managed to mess it
up. Other cities around the globe from New York, to Berlin and Tokyo,
rejoice in their Rickey mobiles -- and pay a lot to get them. Glasgow
alone seems unable to handle generosity -- or kinetics.
First, the two sculptures were vandalised within 24-hours of
installation in Festival Park; then they were deemed ''unsafe for
children''. After that they were left for over a year to rust outside in
a council yard in the East End. They are still there.
Appeals to reinstate the sculptures elsewhere in the city have gone
unheeded. And as Rickey's sculpture is designed to move, experts admit
that, if not in motion, the machined steel-bearings and joints will rust
and jam, and Rickey's million-pound works will be ruined.
Most men would have sued: engineers would have calculated coolly, and
put in a large cash claim for damages; artists would have thrown a
tantrum as well. I can't see Picasso, Warhol, Hockney, Bacon or our own
Henry Moore taking this kind of shoddy treatment in their stride, never
mind forgiving and forgetting.
From his base in East Chatham, New York State, Rickey has born these
difficulties with fortitude. Last December, in an effort to sort things
out, he appealed through The Herald for his works to be re-installed,
literally ''up and swinging'' or returned to him. It was a cry for help.
''I'm very unhappy about them lying in a corner,'' he said. ''If Glasgow
doesn't want them, let other people enjoy them. Many places would love
to have the sculptures.
''A friend, recently returned from Scotland, found the sculptures
dismembered and stacked, one on the other, in a muddy, fenced enclosure,
with no padding or protection. To whom can I turn? These works are far
more easily damaged in storage than out in the open, where they are at
home.''
Rickey ended his letter: ''In sad disappointment, but not yet
despair.''
Six months later, no solution has been found. This sad stalemate was
highlighted at the weekend in a Scottish Television film, Fakelore, by
Murray Grigor who, together with well-known sculptor George Wyllie,
filmed their visit to the parks department store and went on to question
both Pat Lally and Julian Spalding, director of Glasgow Museums about
the fate of the sculptures. As usual, the buck was passed.
But unknown to anyone, Rickey had decided to take steps of his own.
Good-natured, pragmatic and big-hearted, in a gesture entirely
symptomatic of the man, he determined to make things as easy as possible
for Glasgow, known to want a major piece by him for its new Museum of
Modern Art, to be opened in 1996. Indeed, Spalding had approached Rickey
in 1993 to ask about commissioning such a work for the new gallery, and
was quoted a price of #250,000.
His letter to the city, sent on June 13 says: ''There are at present
no proposals from the city for the resolution of this impasse. So I
propose the following: I will offer to the City of Glasgow a choice
between two different sculptures by me, to be approved by the city
beforehand, as acceptable and appropriate for installation where the
city chooses. The city will then return to me the two sculptures now in
storage. No money will pass either way.''
Rickey adds: ''I attach photographs of the two sculptures in question.
I ask that the city choose the one it wants. I will promptly ship it
from here. If the city wants advice or assistance in placing or
installing the new sculpture, I will gladly offer it, either in person
or through a deputy.''
Lucky old Glasgow. Problems solved; saved itself #250,000; avoided
legal fees -- but has it said ''Thank You''? Not yet.
I spoke to Rickey's cousin, Willie Macdonald, in Scotland yesterday.
''He's not heard anything from the city. There seems to be a tide of
bureaucratic inactivity. It's strange that of all the places in the
world, Glasgow makes for difficulties. He's 88 now -- getting on a bit.
I hope they get a move on.''
Murray Grigor, whose late wife Barbara Grigor organised the original
1982 Rickey exhibition, and who was also the driving force behind the
initial gift to the city said: ''It's heartbreaking. It's as though
Rickey is being punished for giving a present to the city.''
Times were happier in 1982. His blockbuster exhibition, opened by the
Lord Provost, was acclaimed. Rickey remembers the occasion fondly. ''I
was honoured with a key to the city, which I still proudly possess.'' At
the time, Rickey also gave a sculpture to the National Gallery of
Scotland. (It was arranged in my house at a birthday party I gave for
him.) There have been no problems there.
Rickey arrived in Scotland from Indiana in 1913, aged six. ''It was a
long way to school from Craigendoran, and I sometimes walked along with
the lamplighter and his pole or stopped in Clyde Street at the
blacksmiths and watched. In the back was a steam engine. I was seven and
I understood both the handiwork and the machine. My father gave me a
little steam engine, in parts, at Christmas. Together we assembled it,
and learnt the principles of the crank, valves and pistons then.''
So it was that Rickey's contribution to kinetic sculpture in metal was
inspired by the machinery and engineering of Clydeside that his father
loved and had taught him.
After attending Miss Johnston's Primary from 1913-14 (in the same
class as David Niven), he went to Glenalmond where he was captain of
rugby; then to Balliol, Oxford, before returning to the States. He
remembers Scotland with great affection: climbing Ben Lomond; a
farmhouse in Crianlarich; the engine rooms of the paddle steamers on the
Clyde, and playing with the Blackie children at Mackintosh's Hill House.
''I went to Miss Cranston's tea rooms and to the art gallery. I liked
the pictures but not as much as the model ships! My clear purpose was to
be an engineer. At 18 I joined the workforce at Singers.''
Rickey made his first mobile sculptures while in the US Air Corps in
1945. His sculptures employ a system which is a variation of the gimbals
used at sea. ''Essentially a universal joint, it permits objects to
pitch and roll.''
Professor of Fine Art at Bloomington and New York, he was on the board
of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has many honorary
degrees from universities around the world and sculptures and
commissions in almost every country.
In 1982 he said: ''I am glad to have had a Scottish childhood. In
making sculpture I find myself using that Scottish education every
day.'' Let's hope this long sad story of a famous artist's gift to
Glasgow may be resolved shortly.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday came under fire on the level of
nurses' pay in Scotland and how their pay increase would be funded.
He clashed with MPs on the Scottish Select Committee as he gave
evidence on the spending plans of the Scottish Office up to 1998.
A number of MPs, including the committee chairman, Labour MP Willie
McKelvey, challenged Mr Lang on the funding of the health service, which
is planned to go up by a relatively small percentage over the next few
years.
They demanded to know how, if the 3% pay offer to nurses was to be
funded in full, the money was to be found. Mr Lang emphasised the
importance of efficiency savings in the health service and insisted
resources were adequate.
Among the MPs concerned was Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr -- Con.), who was
worried that the 3% increase had been imposed at national level, and
wondered how his local health trust would pay for it. He pointed out
that the more spent on wages, the less could be spent on patients to
offset it.
The Scottish Secretary also strongly defended the so-called private
finance initative, in which the private sector is being urged to become
actively involved in health service projects.

GREENPEACE was yesterday cheerfully bracing itself for a flood of
donations and new members, following its sensational victory over Shell.
The clash between them possessed all the hallmarks of a David and
Goliath struggle, and has restored to the veteran campaigners some of
the excitement which surrounded their early protests.
It is hard to believe that barely six months ago Greenpeace appeared
to be a moribund organisation which had lost its cutting edge, and was
tearing itself apart in a welter of internal feuding.
In 20 years it had transformed itself from a few men in a boat,
protesting about nuclear bomb tests in Alaska, to a multinational
organisation with 1000 staff and an income of around #100m a year
(exclusively in membership fees and donations). When the Rainbow Warrior
had roamed the sea in its efforts to save the whale, Greenpeace was the
stuff of contemporary mythology. Their daring, high-profile campaigns
legitimised direct action to influence government.
Greenpeace never really dropped direct action but, as press officer
Robert Morris puts it: ''We had to move on to other things because the
media got bored with these protests. We found we weren't getting more
than local coverage.'' The changes in recent years were more than a
response to the media's appetite for novelty.
In the seventies and early eighties governments refused to admit that
there was a global environmental crisis. Greenpeace helped to change
that, but having done so created a new challenge for themselves. As the
Rio Earth Summit demonstrated so amply, by the early nineties
governments recognised the problems but responded with rhetoric rather
than action.
This rhetoric, combined with heavy handed marketing techniques by
environmental groups, has sent the environment sliding down the
political agenda, particularly in Britain and the US. A sort of ''Green
fatigue'' seemed to have set in, which, combined with the recession,
sent Greenpeace's income tumbling. Membership worldwide fell from around
5,000,000 in 1990 to just over 3,000,000 today.
At the same time new, smaller, direct-action groups like Earth First!,
working at a local level, made Greenpeace seem like the ageing warhorse
of the eco-protest movement. ''They became moribund in terms of direct
action. Their local supporters weren't allowed to do anything except
collect money. A lot of people gave up on Greenpeace and joined the
counterculture,'' said Lesley Boulton of Earth First!
Much of the criticism of Greenpeace focused on what was perceived as
its dictatorial structure. Though the organisation held conferences, and
ran a network of local groups, decisions about the nature and
organisation of campaigns were taken by permanent staff at the London
head office, or the international headquarters in Amsterdam, and carried
out by professional activists. Critics suggested the charity was scared
of having its considerable assets sequestered. (It currently holds #45m
in reserves.) Had David become Goliath?
In reply Greenpeace has adopted new campaigning methods, which involve
confronting companies and the Government with practical alternatives to
the damaging technologies they protest about. An example is the recent
Greenfreeze campaign for alternative refrigeration technology, which
embarrassed Tesco into a change of heart. But this was a tiny victory
compared with its impact on whaling and nuclear testing which gained
little media coverage.
By the end of last year, with income declining and deep cuts imposed
on staff and campaign budget, Greenpeace was in a double-or-quits
dilemma. To regain the moral high-ground in the eco-debate, it needed a
replacement for the whale.
The Brent Spar became that whale, and Greenpeace could hardly have
made a better choice. ''It's great because it shows people that grass
roots action can work,'' says Lesley Boulton of Earth First!
Greenpeace admits that it owed much of its success to its ability to
harness modern technology to drive home its message.
It was the first environmental organisation to use digital compression
television to beam live pictures of its campaigns to the world's media.
Its staff are armed with thousands of mobile telephones, bleepers,
on-site faxes and satellite telephones. It uses E-mail to communicate
with its network of supporters.
Next on the campaigning agenda is solar power, along with drift-net
fishing, and the French atomic tests in the Pacific. With its coffers
replenished by the expected flood of donations, and new members, and
having rediscovered its unique flair for the simple direct approach,
Greenpeace is braced for plenty of action.

THE slogan for this year's Royal SNO Prom series reads ''The world's
great composers in party mood''. Hosted by one Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
last night's party was a disappointingly dull affair. Mozart was, by all
accounts, a first-class party animal but represented by a bland
assortment of pieces, his reputation came under threat.
Eine kleine Nachtmusik doesn't exactly suggest balloons and streamers,
particularly in last night's performance. Heavy-handed and almost bereft
of contrasts, the piece failed to come alive. Conductor En Shao appeared
content to let the music speak for itself, but Mozart needs careful
attention to detail and a lightness of touch missing in the Royal SNO
strings.
The mood promised to lighten in Mozart's 40th G minor symphony.
Colourful in the outer movements, the impact was marred by a tempo
mistake in the sublime Andante which took away the delicate beauty of
the music.
The only glimpse of a party atmosphere came in the E flat Sinfonia
Concertante, although it was a private party held by five of the Royal
SNO's principal wind and brass players who rightly ignored the sombre
mood of their accompanying orchestra. Passages for the solo quintet were
immediately engaging, particularly those from oboist Stephane Rancourt.
A problem of poor programming then. Were the funds not available for a
singer to perform the celebratory Exultate Jubilate, or arias from
Figaro and The Magic Flute? Is a concerto too much to ask for? Couldn't
we have been surprised by an unfamiliar symphony? That way we might have
felt we'd been at a party hosted by the real Mozart.

THE Health Care International project in Clydebank was not a white
elephant and still could be a commercial success, the senior civil
servant at the Scottish Office Industry Department, Mr Peter MacKay,
said yesterday.
Mr MacKay was questioned by MPs on the powerful Commons Public
Accounts Committee who are questioning how public money was used to
support the project and how it was monitored by Ministers and officials.
HCI lasted 110 days from the official opening until the official
receivers were called in, but it now has been rescued by the Abu Dhabi
Investment Agency and is said to be attracting more private patients
from overseas.
Mr MacKay insisted in the face of some hostile questioning that the
net cost to the public purse only had been about #15m.
He stuck by the Scottish Office calculation that various forms of
public assistance totalling #27.6m were provided, against which had to
be set sums received back through VAT payments, National Insurance, Paye
schemes and so on.
Some MPs, however, were far from convinced and amidst reports that the
actual cost to the taxpayer was over #40m they tackled Mr MacKay head
on. He was involved in a series of heated exchanges with Glasgow Central
Labour MP Mike Watson, who suggested HCI was the biggest white elephant
the Scottish Office had ever encountered.
Mr MacKay told him: ''It is not a white elephant. It has been
described as arguably the finest and best equipped hospital in Europe.
It is unfair to describe it as a white elephant.''
Mr Watson also demanded to know why the Scottish Office had not
appreciated the problems with HCI at an earlier stage, given that others
involved in the private health care sector had warned of their
reservations about the project.
Mr MacKay told him: ''One needs to have a degree of caution about
accepting comments from competitors,'' adding that none of them were
proposing the sort of hi-tech operation being put forward by HCI.
Mr Watson suggested the project had flopped, to which Mr MacKay
replied that it had not. Mr Watson challenged: ''So receivership is a
success, is it? To employ 400 when the original plan was to have 2000
direct jobs and 2000 indirect is not a success. Much of the #27m has
gone down the drain.''
Mr MacKay: ''It has not gone down the drain.''
Mr Watson: ''It has gone down a deep, dark hole.''
Mr MacKay: ''I think if you went to Clydebank they would say it has
not gone down a deep, dark hole.''
Mr MacKay insisted that the impact on the National Health Service in
the West of Scotland of the staff taken by HCI was negligible and, while
he recognised lessons could be learned from what had happened, he was
confident about the future.
On lessons for the future, he said: ''It is early days and we are
still looking at our procedures, but we need to be better prepared in
the future to deal with large projects supported by a consortium. Let's
be clear about who is in the lead, who is driving.''
In a statement issued at Westminster last night, Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang ''Assistance to HCI, mainly in the form of Regional Selective
Assistance, was offered in order to generate investment and employment
at Clydebank.
''The asset created by that investment is in place and, under the new
operators of the hospital, employment is starting to increase. Already,
several hundred jobs are in place with the prospect of substantially
more to follow.''

CONFERENCES and conventions are a major part of the Hospitality Inn's
business. The hotel offers a comprehensive range of banqueting,
conference, and exhibition facilities.
''We recently hosted a 300-delegate residential conferences for the
Institute of Actuaries and the British Diabetic Association,'' said
general manager Tim Hunt, ''and in November we will be the headquarters
hotel for the Junior Chamber of Commerce International Conference, a
six-day, 4000 delegate conference using the Royal Concert Hall and
ourselves as bases.''
The Hospitality Inn and Convention Centre is as much at ease with 15
delegates as with 1500, while specially prepared menus range from simple
finger buffets to presentation banquets featuring main courses carved in
the room in front of guests.
The air-conditioned grand ballroom can seat 1000 guests in comfort and
is the location for West Sound Radio's Burns Supper -- the largest
formal Burns Supper in Scotland. In 1993 it was renovated and fitted out
with a multi-million pound project designed to enable it to host the
most highly sophisticated and technically demanding product launches,
cabaret shows, and meetings, in addition to conferences and dinner
dances.
The Hospitality Inn also has a further 18 meeting rooms, as well as a
specially designed business centre, providing secretarial and office
services. All these facilities, allied to the refurbished bedrooms and a
choice of bars and restaurants, make the hotel an ideal venue for
residential conferences.
''From September to June the hotel does particularly well in the
conference and banqueting market, and also from corporate business
travel,'' said Tim Hunt.
''However, in the summer months of July and August, we achieve good
occupancy from the international and domestic leisure markets on an
individual and a group basis. We welcome 10,000 Icelandic guests a year,
as shopping in Glasgow is three times cheaper than in Reykjavik, while
there is a 350-delegate conference coming from Sweden in September.''
A lot of thought has gone into the business traveller's needs in the
layout of the new executive rooms, which all feature computer and fax
links, thus enabling executives to work using their own computers.''

MANILA: A man wanted in connection with the murder of nine-year-old
Daniel Handley was being deported from the Philippines last night. The
30-year-old suspect was arrested last week in Olongapo, 50 miles west of
Manila, and ordered to leave the country, a Bureau of Immigration

ENVIRONMENT Secretary John Gummer said he found Labour's plans for the
future government of London ''utterly incredible''. As readers may
remember, the Prime Minister recently found the idea of dismantling the
Brent Spar on land ''incredible'', so Londoners can probably look
forward to a strategic planning authority for the metropolis rising from
the ashes of Mr Ken Livingstone's GLC.
Voltaire once observed that if God did not exist it would have been
necessary to invent him. Mr Gummer, whose interest in theology is well
known, following this line of thought proclaimed that as the desire for
English regional authorities did not exist among the populace it had
been necessary for the Labour Party to invent it.
The necessity arose, he said, from the prior existence of their plan
to have a Scottish parliament and the need to balance this and thus
solve the troublesome West Lothian question. We would not wish to tangle
with Mr Gummer on theology but on the West Lothian question he is
plainly wrong.
Except in the crazed minds of some Liberal Democrat federalists, the
idea of having English parliaments with the same powers as the putative
Scottish parliament does not exist. Mr Blair has said of such assemblies
''I don't see the necessity'' and a cautious retreat from the
proposition seems to be under way. Mr Gummer and his backbench
battalions quite properly harassed the retreat.
While Mr Gummer had loyal troops baying in support, mutiny was in the
air as Mr Douglas Hurd began an elegant exposition of the Govenment's
plans for the forthcoming Euro-summit at Cannes, and suggested that the
EU institutions were now about right.
Mr Hurd promised there would be no further encroachments by Brussels.
What he and the Foreign Office do not yet seem to have grasped is that
the Euro-sceptics believe that Brussels, aided by the European Court of
Justice, have all the necessary implements of encroachment in their
hands already with time and a passive British Government on their side.
Mr Alex Salmond suggested that Mr Hurd was rather like a wagon train
surrounded by Red Indians.
But there were friendly Redskins about as well, flaunting the strings
of beads and wampum which the Brussels traders dispense to the
friendlier tribes. At one point, Sir Edward Sitting Bull even pulled out
a pipe of peace and praised the negotiating technique of Pocahontus
Thatcher.
If the wagon master followed her lead of saying ''No, No, No'' and
then ''Yes, Yes'' a bit later, he was confident that all would be well
and everyone would have a chicken in the pot of his wigwam.
Given that scalping knives have been the order of the day when Sitting
Bull and Pocahontus found themselves in the same tepee, this wily
compliment took everyone aback.
Mr Hurd said he thought he was grateful but would like to study the
old chief's words with great care. The Sceptic chiefs said that when the
Cannes communique comes out, they will examine that with great care for
examples of forked tongue.

GRANT maintained schools would be offered the choice of becoming
''foundation schools'' under a Labour Government, the party is expected
to announce today.
Critics within the party and outside are certain to condemn the move
as a huge policy U-turn.
Opt-out schools are the flagships of the Government's education
reforms, reviled by Labour as a backdoor to the return of selection.
Party traditionalists would be satisfied with nothing less than
straightforward return to local education authority control.
However, the new status -- available to all schools south of the
Border -- would allow governors to retain control over staff and
buildings.
There also is expected to be a ''dialogue'' with existing opt-out
schools about their present financial independence from local education
authorities (LEAs).
For left-wingers, the proposals will be the compromise they feared
when Labour leader Tony Blair decided to send his son Euan to the grant
maintained London Oratory School.
The Government is certain to seize on what it will portray as Labour
once again stealing its clothes.
However, Mr Blair and Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett are
expected to trumpet instead a new relationship between LEAs and all
schools as the key to raising standards.
LEAs would not ''control'' any schools, they will emphasise, but
support them and intervene where they were failing -- with inspection,
advice and teacher training.
Parents would be offered a bigger role in running all schools. LEA
also schools would have more financial independence. The proposals are
expected to offer them control of 90% of their own budgets, up from the
present 85%.
Sir Robert Balchin, chairman of the Grant Maintained Schools
Foundation, has already accused Labour of preparing to abolish them not
with one blow but by ''a thousand cuts''.
Labour's leaders know how damaging such criticism could be.
More than a million parents send their children to grant-maintained
schools, many in constituencies in the South and South-east of England
that Labour must win to form a Government.

MORE than #6m is being spent on upgrading the 307 bedrooms at
Glasgow's Hospitality Inn and Convention Centre, with the aim of
transforming it into Glasgow's premier hotel.
A total of 100 bedrooms, including 27 business executive suites, have
already been completed while work on upgrading the remaining bedrooms to
executive standard will continue throughout 1995, prior to the hotel's
relaunch as the Glasgow Thistle at the end of the year.
Tim Hunt, the hotel's general manager, said: ''The Hospitality Inn
already has large and modern conference and banqueting space and the
multi-million pound investment programme in the bedrooms will ensure
that it has the most comprehensive facilities in the city, while
maintaining its reputation for quality, individuality and friendly
service.''
The hotel is owned by Thistle and Mount Charlotte Hotels, which owns
26 hotels with 2307 bedrooms, and is Scotland's largest hotel company.
It jointly forms the UK's second largest hotel group and has more
AA-listed four-star hotels than any rival concern.
Mount Charlotte Investments, the parent company of Thistle and Mount
Charlotte Hotels, is committed to refurbishing and upgrading its Mount
Charlotte properties including the Thistle portfolio. More than
two-thirds of the group's properties, including the renamed Glasgow
Thistle will be Thistle Hotels by the end of 1996. Tim Hunt explained:
''Our chief executive and his fellow directors have invested a great
deal of time, effort, and money on upgrading a number of Mount Charlotte
properties to Thistle property standard. The corporate aim over the next
five years is to develop the largest group of four-star hotels in the
UK.''
Guests occupying the Hospitality Inn's standard and executive bedrooms
benefit from the provision of 17 radio, TV, and satellite channels,
including CNN and three Sky movie channels. Tea and coffee making
machines are also provided in addition to direct dial telephones. All
rooms have private bathrooms with shower and hair dryer, double glazing,
temperature-controlled environment, writing desk and trouser press.
The hotel's 77 new refurbished business executive suites -- some of
the largest in Britain -- will include two double beds, dressing area,
three-seater sofa, coffee table and either a large executive working
desk or a table which can seat four people for a formal meal. They will
also feature mini-bars, room safes, trouser presses with ironing centres
and computer and fax points.
Deluxe rooms are the largest standard hotel bedrooms in Scotland,
while lady executive rooms and rooms for non-smokers are also available.
Tim Hunt explained: ''We introduced lady executive rooms about eight
years ago as we became aware that more of our clientele were single lady
executives. These rooms have additional toiletries, a selection of
quality ladies' magazines and journals and, prior to the refurbishment,
were the only rooms with ironing centres.
''We are also increasing the number of non-smoking rooms to meet the
growing demand from our health-conscious customers. Currently we have 60
non-smoking rooms available and once the refurbishment is completed we
will have two complete non-smoking floors.''
Security is a key feature of the refurbishment programme. The 77
business executive suites will all have room safes, while all rooms will
have a strong mortice double lock, a security chain, and a peephole.
The wallpaper in all the new bedrooms was specially designed for
Thistle and Mount Charlotte Hotels. General manager Tim Hunt commented :
''We spend more on refurbishing our hotels than any other hotel group in
Scotland. Each year for the last four years we have invested #30m in
refurbishing and improving hotels throughout the UK.
''There is a subtle Scottish flavour to all the newly refurbished
rooms, whether it be Scottish-style prints hanging on the walls or
discreet tartan fabrics on the beds or soft furnishings.
''One client we recently sold a conference to told us that the new
executive rooms offered him the comfort and convenience of being in a
city centre location, with the quality and style of a country house
hotel.''
In addition to upgrading all rooms to executive standard,
Glasgow-based contractors John Cochrane &amp; Co Ltd are restoring the lift
wells with marble flooring, console tables, and new wall coverings. The
refurbishment, which started in September 1994, is due for completion by
Christmas 1996.
Room rates range from #85 to #195 during the week, while special
weekend rates range from #54.50 to #86.50.

HUNTSVILLE: Convicted killer Karl Hammond, 30, was put to death by
lethal injection yesterday for the 1986 murder of a 21-year-old FBI
secretary who was raped and stabbed to death in her San Antonio
apartment. In Potosi, Missouri, Larry Griffin, who had been on death row
for 15 years was also put to death by injection for a shooting.

<HEADLINE>Scotland is home to the well-educated couch potato</HEADLINE>

THE natural habitat of the couch potato is the Lowlands of Scotland,
according to the latest edition of Regional Trends, the annual
statistical look at the way we are, published today.
In the Central Scotland ITV region, people watched an average of more
than 27.3 hours of television a week in 1994, almost five hours more
than viewers in London, who watched the least television. The UK average
was 25.2 hours.
Scotland emerges from this latest survey of the nation's social habits
rather well, partly because the recession bit more deeply in the south
of the United Kingdom in recent years, narrowing the long-established
north-south divide.
Things, however, may be reverting to the way they were. There was a
significant drop in unemployment in all regions in 1994, with the
biggest fall being in East Anglia and the south-east and south-west of
England.
Between 1990 and 1993, at the height of the recession, unemployment
almost trebled in the south-east, whereas the rise in Scotland was
relatively small.
THE GOOD NEWS FOR SCOTS IS:
* House prices rose by 31% between 1989 and 1994, the biggest rise of
any region.
* Scotland has more owner occupiers. The number rose by 4% between
1991 and 1993, the highest rise of any region.
* Our paid holiday entitlements are on average more generous than in
any other region.
* Our schoolchildren are cleverer than those in England and Wales, and
Scots girls are cleverer than Scots boys. The fact that Scotland has the
smallest class sizes in both primary and secondary schools could have
something to do with it.
* Recorded crime fell by 8% between 1992 and 1993. This compares with
1% in England, 2% in Northern Ireland, and 3% in Wales.
THE BAD NEWS:
* More people over 45 in Scotland will go tothe doctor. The figures
for 1993 show that 20% of Scots between 45 and 64, and 25% of those over
65 visited their GP, 3% and 4% more than the corresponding percentage
figures for England.
* Scotland comes second bottom of the league for 1993, next to the
North of England, when it comes to owning cars, with 44% of households
having one car, 16% having two.
* Scotsmen tied with Ulstermen as the country's heaviest smokers, one
in six falling into that category in 1992. Scotswomen easily led the
heavy smoker field at one in every eight.
* Scotland's reputation for liking the hard stuff more than the rest
of the country is a myth. In 1992, around 7% of Scots men were teetotal
compared to 6% in England.
* Scotland had the highest death rates, the standard mortality ratio
in 1993 being 119 compared with 98 in England. More Scots die before
reaching retirement age.

ANGUISHED and angry family members of victims of the ''friendly fire''
shootdown of two US helicopters over Iraq last year said today they want
a full-scale investigation into the incident.
Speaking after the only person court-martialled in the case was
acquitted yesterday, the families called for hearings by Congress to fix
blame for the deaths of 15 Americans and 11 Britons, French, Turks and
Kurds.
Aides to the Senate Armed Services and House (of Representatives)
National Security committees, which have jurisdiction over military
matters, said no hearings have been scheduled.
The 26 who died were aboard two US Army Black Hawk helicopters flying
on a peace-keeping mission in April, 1994 when two patrolling US F-15
fighters shot them down.
The pilots said no-one told them about the flight in a ''no-fly'' zone
and the helicopters looked like Iraqi Hind aircraft.
Air Force Captain Jim Wang, the senior director aboard an Airborne
Warning and Control System (Awacs) radar plane that day, was acquitted
yesterday on three counts of dereliction of duty by a jury at Tinker Air
Force Base in Oklahoma.
His lawyer disputed prosecution claims that he could tell by looking
at green dots on his radar screen that the helicopters were friendly and
said Wang was performing to the best of his ability and acted on the
information he had.
The Air Force issued seven admonishments or reprimands against other
officers involved but singled out Wang for trial because prosecutors
felt he should have warned off the F-15 pilots.
Upset that no-one has been severely penalised -- the reprimands will
be cleared from the officers' records in two years -- family members
made the rounds of television talk shows to demand further action.
Butch Colbert, whose son Jeff was killed in the accident, said on CNN:
''There's got to be somebody responsible for this 26 lives that's been
lost . . . Definitely a congressional hearing's what we're looking for .
. .
''My family and the other 14 families are going to set forth, we're
going to fight and fight and fight,'' Colbert said.
Wang, a 29, an Air Force Academy graduate, also said he wants to clear
the air.
''I agree that a lot of responsibility and a lot of accountability has
not been accepted by the Air Force, by commanders and the administration
. . . and for that to happen we need a congressional hearing,'' he told
CBS-TV's This Morning.--Reuter.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton was defeated in the Senate today in a vote on
his nominee for Surgeon-General.
A procedural motion to cut off a filibuster by the Republicans was
defeated by three votes.
There will be another vote on the issue tomorrow, but the chances are
not good.
The nominee is Dr Henry Foster, a black obstetrician from Tennessee
who was named in February to replace Dr Jocelyn Elders, who had been
sacked last Christmas.
Dr Elders had been given to issuing inflammatory statements, to the
president's great embarrassment, and he finally dumped her when she
advocated schools teaching masturbation in class.
Dr Foster appeared to have every possible qualification, but the
president and his advisers failed to note that obstetricians sometimes
perform abortions.
Dr Foster concedes that he has carried out about 40 over the past 30
years.
The anti-abortion forces mobilised against him, and now appear to be
winning.
For months, the Republican leader, Senator Bob Dole, delayed putting
the question to a vote. He is a candidate for the Republican nomination
for the presidency, and needs those anti-abortion votes.
Senator Phil Gramm, who is his chief rival, promised to filibuster the
nomination, and today's vote failed to defeat him.
Under the Senate's rules, it needs 60 of the 100 senators to break a
filibuster. The vote today was 57 for closure, 43 against.
All 46 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted for the doctor, but that was
not enough. Democrats hope to find those extra three Republican votes by
tomorrow, but were unable to say where they would get them.
If they succeed, of course, there would be a straightforward vote on
the nomination and Dr Foster would win easily.
Filibusters are not what they used to be. Senators no longer spend
hours together reading from phone books.
All that is needed is the threat of a filibuster, and the technique
was much used by Republicans in the last Congress, when they were in the
minority, to block Democratic proposals.

THE National Trust for Scotland now. Dreadfully keen on Scotland the
National Trust is. Thus Volume 12 number 2 of its magazine, entitled
Heritage Scotland, has enough sense of Scotland's heritage to run an ad
on its inside front pages for Autumn Sunshine Cruises to France, Spain,
Portugal, and Africa. As a wee extra insult to Scotland the boat departs
not from the Broomielaw but from Falmouth. Never heard of it, the Diary.
We think it's somewhere south.
Dumplings
INTERCITY, issue no 4, which is presumably to do with InterCity UK,
that is to say the United Kingdom, sends us its West Coast Preview.
Awffy nice. It has a, well, tasty piece about Taste of Scotland in which
it tells us all that ''some things in life are totally Scottish -- bens
and glens, tartan and whiskey . . .'' It has totally Scottish spelling
as well.
Nothing wrong with Irish whiskey, just that the Scots spell their
national drink somewhat differently. The Irish might have invented the
Water of Life, but the Scots improved it and rid ourselves of an
unnecessary extra ''e''. Incidentally, this glossy brochure informs us
of other traditional Scottish culinary items including the famous
''Clootie Dumpling''.
And here we are, for the Diary can exclusively reveal that the subject
of tomorrow's episode of the BBC's Big Country programme, at sivvin
o'clock of a night, is in fact clootie dumplings. The actual clootie
dumpling in question is none other than chef and TV personality of this
parish, George Quar, he who presides with some regality over the tables
at his ristorante in Glasgow's Cathcart Road of a day. George is
presenting his clientele daily with the produce of Scotland but it is
never clootie dumplings and in fact George doesn't really know -- head
chef of The Dorchester as he was -- really how to do one.
For the BBC programme, fronted by Janice Forsyth, has a clootie
dumpling ostensibly made by the ebullient George, made by his wife
Moira. Moira had to be persuaded not to put silver threepennies wrapped
in greaseproof paper into the mix. George had to be persuaded not to eat
the uncooked mixture in the first place. This is not the first or the
last time that George has masqueraded. Son Alan, also a chef in George's
bistro, is doing all the grub for STV's Square Meals programme which
goes out in late July and August. Says the bow-tied and diminutive
George, with candour: ''Dammit; I am a bigger imposter than the Monocled
Mutineer. Food's good though.'' Well it is.
French horn
BUT now we come to the Auld Alliance. The competition gets better and
better. Latest to come to our attention is Sir Fitzroy MacLean's offer
of a night for two at his splendid Creggan's Inn with breakfast in bed
to follow. As it happens, today's editor is related to Sir Fitz,
Scotland's greatest war hero and all that, and your Diary chap gets to
go to his marvellous spot for sod-all anyway so it means that the Urban
V isn't going to cheat. But cheat away the rest of you.
Here's a wee cheat. Your editor spent his very first holiday in
France, aged 21, telling French folk ''Je ne parle pas Anglais''.
Neither did they, if it comes to that. What the young femmes spent our
holiday over was not in talking. It was body language. When you are
twenty-plus your accent doesn't count.
A head for business
And here we come to it in the Diary. The Bad Bit. Sea captain of my
acquaintance, from the island of the West, not very good at the English
language. In fact not very good at all. In fact a source of fun. Two
friends of the Diary are in the Boswell Hotel in the South Side of
Glasgow and both of them are in the business of selling stamps at
auction. Good lads. Captain MacKenzie, him without the English, much, is
heard to ask the lieges about ''these two chaps who are into fellatio --
you know the fellows, the fellatio-ists''.
Ach well, if you come from Stornoway you are entitled to your
innocence. Gary and John loved it, the two philatelists, when they found
out the next day. Says Gary Buchanan, a well-known stamp dealer: ''I
wouldn't even lick a stamp; you always want an unused one because it
sells more.'' And you think a Gael is naive?
Lion's share
WILLIE McGUINNESS had his funeral the other day in Glasgow, a
Franciscan one. The priest told us all that he lived life to the full.
This was an understatement. Willie was a character who was able to stand
for every political party we have ever heard of. Had he lived longer --
and he was 80 when he left us -- he'd have joined the Raving Loony
Party.
It was a big occasion in Glasgow's Gorbals and a lot of us turned out.
Billy McNeill was there as well, you know, the big Lisbon Lion. Your
editor found out why he was there. In common with everybody else he was
there to make his respects to a wonderful rapscallion of a street
bookie, one of the last. Deep in talk and reminiscence it was discovered
that Big Billy, along with the rest of us, had turned up basically to
discover if we were going to get paid the money that Willie had taken
from us.
''When was that, the ten quid?'' your editor asked. ''1967'' replied
Billy. We all laughed. Billy and the rest of the boys were in black
ties. ''No all that bad really,'' said Billy. ''It was me that owed
him.'' Willie will be laughing all the way to the bad fire, and I hope
we join him there at that.

THE most common complaint of television viewers is that too many
repeats are shown on all the mainstream channels, according to a report
out today.
More people see this as evidence of declining broadcasting standards
than violence, swearing or sex scenes, says the annual survey by the
Independent Television Commission.
Audiences interviewed for the report mainly thought standards had
stayed the same.
Just over one in four felt they had deteriorated, and one in 10
detected an improvement. People who judged television to be on the
decline tended to be aged 45 or more.
Asked if they saw anything on television which they found offensive,
40% said they did. This, according to the ITC, is a percentage which has
remained consistent in every survey conducted since 1970.
In a question about the type of programme which interested the viewer
most, soap operas came top with 33%, films a close second at 32%, and
quiz shows third with 31%. Programmes about religion came last in a list
of 28 categories with only 4%.
Television was regarded by the the vast majority of viewers as a
better source of news than newspapers.
The number of people who claim that television is their principal
source for world news is now almost five times as great as the number
who cite newspapers and television's dominance is growing, says the
report.
The survey, which is based on research carried out in 1994, also
suggests that more than 75% of the population believe that television
offers the most complete coverage of national and international affairs.
In addition, 76% perceive television news to be the most accurate, 71%
the most fair, 72% the quickest, and 78% reckon it gives the clearest
understanding.

SIR Richard Scott yesterday effectively cleared Agriculture Minister
William Waldegrave of leaking damaging extracts of the draft report of
his arms-to-Iraq inquiry.
He accepted there was ''no evidence'' to link Mr Waldegrave to the
leak which accused Ministers of deliberately misleading MPs over a shift
in policy on arms sales to Iraq in the late 1980s.
The Scott Inquiry said on Tuesday that a molehunt had narrowed the
field of suspects down to three -- taken by Labour to mean Mr Waldegrave
and two former Ministers.
In letters published at Westminster, Mr Waldegrave said the linking of
his name with the leak investigation was the ''inevitable and
foreseeable result'' of the phrasing of the statement from Inquiry
secretary Christopher Muttukamaru.
''The references in question attributed to Mr Muttukamaru were no
doubt approved by you and have placed me, quite gratuitously, in an
intolerable position,'' he said.
''I have no knowledge whatsoever of how this leak came about. I
strongly protest at the way you have, unnecessarily, placed me in such
difficulties, adding to the damage that has been done to me in recent
days.'' He demanded an assurance that the Inquiry had no evidence to
link him in any way to the leak.
Sir Richard again insisted that the field of suspects had been
narrowed down to three.
However, he added: ''I am happy to confirm that I have no evidence
that you, personally, had any knowledge of how the leak came about. I
have never suggested otherwise, nor has Mr Muttukamaru done so.
''There are, of course, likely to have been a number of people who
may, quite properly, have been permitted by each of the recipients in
question to have access to the extracts.
''I would add that I have not publicly named the three recipients and
have no intention of doing so. Nor has Mr Muttukamaru.''
The leak to ITN suggested the decision to shift policy over arms sales
to Iraq was taken by Mr Waldegrave during his time at the Foreign
Office, along with former Trade Minister Alan Clark and former Defence
Minister Lord Trefgarne.
Extracts from the Scott draft report are being sent out to individuals
facing criticism to allow them to answer back.
On Tuesday, Mr Muttukamaru said only three people could have seen the
extracts as disclosed by ITN -- a statement that was widely taken as an
accusation aimed at the three Ministers.
However, both Mr Waldegrave and Lord Trefgarne denied any involvement
in the leak and Mr Clark was yesterday reported to have been assured by
the inquiry team that he was not one of the three suspects as he had not
received the relevant documents.
Meanwhile, a Commons committee last night looked set to launch an
inquiry into allegations that an arms company of which Mr Jonathan
Aitken, Treasury Chief Secretary, was a director broke the Government's
embargo on sales to Iran.
The influential Trade and Industry Committee said it was calling Trade
President Michael Heseltine to appear before members as soon as possible
to clarify what documents they could examine as part of an inquiry.

A FEW days ago I received a letter from the Secretary of State
inviting me to become a member of the West Water Authority. This is one
of the three quangos being established by the Government to run the
water and sewerage services in Scotland.
I declined Mr Lang's offer. In my letter to him I set out my reasons.
First, I am opposed to the removal of water and sewerage from local
government control. Secondly, I object to ''government by quango''.
The removal of water and sewerage from local authorities has been a
highly contentious issue in Scotland and has caught the attention of the
public in a way that local government issues seldom do. The referendum
which Strathclyde Regional Council carried out last year attracted a
response from over 1.2 million -- 71.5% of the people eligible to vote
-- and 97.2% of the respondents voted against the Government's
proposals. The response rate of 71.5% is about double the turnout at
local elections, and roughly the same as the turnout at a General
Election. It certainly was a massive thumbs-down to the Government.
One of the great achievements of my predecessors in local government
was the establishment in the nineteenth century of public water and
sewerage schemes such as Loch Katrine, and the public have confidence in
the system as it is.
I know from my experience as one of the last members of the Scottish
Development Agency just how difficult it is for a quango member to
operate the levers of power for the benefit of the public. The man or
woman in the street who turns to a quango for help in sorting out a
problem is unlikely to meet with much success because the quango members
do not have the legitimacy of democratic election which works so
effectively in local government. It's a bit like being a non-executive
director of BMARC.
Local authority officials generally respect the position of
councillors as representatives of the people who are, after all, their
paymasters. For the Secretary of State to appoint as quango members
people who happen to be councillors, does nothing to give these bodies
democratic legitimacy.
The main argument used by the Government to justify the removal of
these services from local government is the high capital investment
required to bring them into line with European Union standards. The
Government contends that this can be funded only by the private sector.
This is arrant nonsense. Councils finance their capital programmes by
borrowing from the same financial institutions as the private sector.
Given the will, the Government could have removed the limits on local
authority borrowing and re-defined public expenditure so as to enable
councils to continue their traditional role as providers of quality
water and sewerage services.
On the wider issue of government by quango, there is increasing unease
at the extent to which they permeate the life of the nation. Although
the total number of quangos may have fallen over recent years, their
total expenditure has increased, and now amounts to one-fifth of all
public spending. In Scotland alone there are over 5000 quango
appointments made by Scottish Office Ministers, compared with around
1200 elected councillors.
Quangos fall into three categories -- advisory, tribunal, and
executive. The advisory quangos are relatively uncontroversial. They
include the advisory committees on travelling people and on Sites of
Special Scientific Interest.
Tribunals include Children's Panels and the Horse Race Betting Levy
Appeal Tribunal.
It is the executive quangos which cause the most concern. They have
big budgets and employ large numbers of staff -- Scottish Homes, for
example, employs over 1200 people and spends nearly #500m annually,
while Scottish Enterprise has an annual budget of over #450m. Both of
these have taken over functions from local government. They are run by
small boards of members appointed by the Secretary of State and they
spend huge amounts of public money. I believe that those who exercise
public powers and who spend public money should be accountable to the
public for whom they act. They should be required to give an account to
the public and be held accountable by the public.
But what form does a quango's accountability take? If it exists at
all, it is through a long line, first to the minister who made the
appointments (and how much thought did he put into the individual
appointments?), the minister is then, in theory at least, accountable to
Parliament, and Parliament is then accountable to the electorate through
the ballot box every five years. So if I don't like the way the chairmen
of Scottish Homes and Scottish Enterprise run their organisations, I
don't cast my vote for the Conservative candidate at the next General
Election in my Glasgow constituency of Maryhill. Some accountability!
In local government, councillors stand for election and their names
come before the public. The law ensures that meetings of local councils
and their committees are open to the press and public, and many of their
documents are open to public inspection. Local authorities are required
to publish annual accounts and performance indicators. If a councillor
has a financial or other interest in a matter, he or she must declare
it, take no part in the discussion or vote, and the declaration is
recorded in the minutes.
Council expenditure is open to scrutiny by the Accounts Commission
(itself a quango) and councillors and officials can be surcharged for
improper expenditure. There is a Local Government Ombudsman who
investigates complaints of injustice caused by maladministration, and
each local authority has to appoint a monitoring officer, or
''whistle-blower'', whose job is to check the legality of the council's
activities.
Contrast the situation with quangos. The names of appointees do not
come before the public in advance. There is no requirement on them to
state their political affiliation, and Government Ministers have refused
to supply this information to Parliament on the grounds that ''the
information sought is not held centrally and could be obtained only at
disproportionate cost''. The classic answer when a minister wants to
keep the House of Commons in the dark.
Quangos are not, in general, required to hold any meetings in public
and there is no public right of access to their papers or minutes.
Some, but not all, publish annual reports, which are often little more
than glossy PR jobs. The accounts of only a few are subject to full
audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Declarations of interest,
if they are made, are made only to the board, and the press and public
have difficulty in finding out where conflicts of interest may arise.
Nor are quango members and officers liable to surcharge. Many quangos
are not subject to investigation by any ombudsman, and none of them has
the equivalent of the local government monitoring officer.
I'm not advocating that the functions of all quangos should be
transferred to local authorities. I'm reasonably happy to leave the
Scottish Seed Potato Development Council, for example, as it is. But
those quangos which have taken over local authority functions should be
abolished and their functions returned to elected councils. And all
would benefit from the kind of openness and accountability which is the
hallmark of local government.
Over one million people in Strathclyde voted to keep Scotland's water
under democratic control -- and I was one of them. So, thank you for
your invitation, Mr Lang. You'll understand why I'm saying ''No''.

* THOSE who watched the heart-rending documentary on television, The
Dying Rooms, about abandoned Chinese girls left to die in badly run
orphanages, may want to help save them. A special trust fund has been
set up and if you want to make a donation it should be sent to The Dying
Rooms Trust, 68 Thames Road, London W4 3RE. The trust will send
financial contributions to international charities such as Save the
Children which are working in orphanages in China.
* IF you are a carer of a relative suffering from senile dementia you
will be well aware of the difficulty of getting a break from your
24-hour-a-day role. It's estimated that only one in five people do
manage to get away for a holiday, according to a recent report published
by Alzheimer Scotland -- Action on Dementia.
They identify the key problems as the availability of services, and
add that it's a lottery depending on where you live, coupled with a lack
of publicity about such services. Yet there are a number of excellent
respite care projects in operation which give the carer a break. These
range from short-stay breaks at Rosebank, Kilmarnock, to specialist
dementia day care at the Woodlands Project, Inverness, and Day Carers in
Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes which provide home support on a daily basis.

* NEW research has identified a gene which pinpoints those at risk of
developing osteoporosis say scientists at St Thomas's Hospital, London.
The study involved over 200 pairs of post-menopausal twins and it
showed that individuals with one particular form of a gene had a greatly
reduced bone density when compared with their sibling.
The findings confirm that reduced bone density is responsible for a
50% increase in susceptibility to fractures.
* Tall, childless women have an increased risk of breast cancer
according to a study carried out in Milan. Higher social class and a
family history of breast cancer were also associated with increased
risk.
Epidemiologists, writing in the British Journal of Cancer, said the
link with height and reduced fertility suggested the involvement of
chromosome defects.
* THE number of children born with Down's syndrome has declined
significantly as a result of pre-natal diagnosis. Researchers say 90% of
Down's syndrome pregnancies ended in termination, according to a recent
article in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
* THE anti-obesity drug, Tenuate Dospan, is to be withdrawn from use
by the manufacturer. This follows growing concern about the abuse of
slimming pills by people who are not overweight. Recently the Department
of Health issued proposals designed to prevent slimming clinics from
prescribing such drugs for people who do not have a major weight
problem.
Now the Government's advisory committee on NHS drugs is also
considering blacklisting all slimming pills, says a report in GP
magazine, the doctor's weekly journal.

Washington, Wednesday,
SECRETARY of State Warren Christopher today formally warned Congress
that approving legislation moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem
could seriously damage the peace process at a delicate time.
In a letter to Republicans leaders, he said he would recommend that
President Clinton veto the bill if it is passed by the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
''There is no issue related to the Arab-Israeli negotiations that is
more sensitive than Jerusalem. It is precisely for this reason that any
effort by Congress to bring it to the forefront is ill-advised and
potentially very damaging to the success of the peace-process,''
Christopher said in the letter, released by his office.
Jerusalem is among the final status issues to be resolved in
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
If there is a premature focus on it, ''the enemies of peace would use
the Jerusalem issue to inflame passions further and attack those who
want negotiaitons to succeed,'' he said.
Meanwhile, a senior Israeli official said today he expected no
agreement to be reached at talks with Syria next week on security
arrangements to follow a proposed Israeli withdrawal on the Golan
Heights.--Reuter.

Diyarbakir, Turkey, Wednesday
FORTY-SIX people died in clashes between Kurdish rebels and government
forces in southeast Turkey today, officials said.
The heaviest fighting was in the remote province of Hakkari where
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas killed 13 troops and lost 21 of
their own in a raid on a remote security post.
It was the latest in a series of rebel attacks in the area where
Turkey meets Iran and Iraq.
Troops killed 12 guerrillas in another part of Hakkari and in other
southeastern provinces, security officials said.
President Suleyman Demirel, who was in the eastern town of Tunceli to
inspect military operations, put the goverment death toll at 13 from the
early morning raid in Hakkari.
Security officials in Diyarbakir, hub of the counter-insurgency
effort, said 11 soldiers and 21 PKK fighters were killed in the attack.
The PKK killed 20 troops last week in two night raids on military
posts in Hakkari and a neighbouring province.
Turkey has scores of remote gendarmerie and army stations on its
borders with Iraq and Iran to prevent rebel infiltration.
About 35,000 Turkish troops poured into northern Iraq in March for a
six-week drive against PKK bases there but Iraqi Kurds says the rebels
are again active in the border area.
A senior Iranian official told Demirel yesterday that Tehran backed a
Turkish plan for joint military action against the rebels on their
common border.
More than 16,000 guerrillas, soldiers and civilians have died in the
PKK's 11-year fight for an independent state in southeast
Turkey.--Reuter.

ELIZABETH WESTCOTT cuts down a few popular misconceptions, as she
explores the link between media images and conditions such as anorexia
nervosa
PUBLIC debate about the so-called ''slimmer's disease'' anorexia
nervosa exploded in the sixties, when Twiggy's long bony limbs became
the new Western standard of beauty. Now, in the nineties, Kate Moss has
reignited the fire with images of her flat, fatless stomach featured in
glossy advertising campaigns.
The waif look caught on, style gurus created clothes for smaller
bodies, and Moss was blamed for thousands of schoolgirls starving
themselves into the new, skinny size 10. But do Moss, and the fashion
world she leads, really play a role in causing eating disorders like
anorexia nervosa?
Anorexia is a misunderstood disease. Public discussion focuses on
three stereotypical beliefs: that anorexia is mainly to do with women
and their pre-occupation with having a thin, perfect body; that it
occurs among wealthier socio-economic groups, and that it is becoming
more common. None of these beliefs, according to research psychologist
Maisie Gard, is true.
''The stereotypes are not really born out of research,'' Gard says.
''Many eating disorders are missed because of the stereotype; among the
homeless, ethnic minorities and men in general.
''People look at a tall skinny man and just think he's a skinny man.
But the skinny woman is suspected of having anorexia.''
Gard believes that despite the hype, the media and super-slender
cultural icons like Kate Moss play a secondary role in the development
of eating disorders.
''Everyone is exposed to those images, but only 1% of the population
develops anorexia, and 1-2% develop bulimia. Of course, slim role models
are influential and once anorexia is in place the media probably help in
maintaining the disorder, but it's just one of a range of factors.''
While the majority of women are concerned about their weight and have
culturally influenced ideas about body shape, it is not true that most
women suffer at some point during their lives from a form of eating
disorder. As Gard points out, there is a massive difference between
bingeing once a month and developing anorexia.
In fact, far from setting out to attain an ideal figure, anorexics are
seeking to achieve something more than weight loss by starving
themselves. It is a method, says Gard, of taking control when life
becomes too chaotic.
''In my view, anorexia is a response to a set of circumstances, or a
crisis of identity. It's a terribly effective solution. While drugs and
alcohol make your life more chaotic, anorexia actually imposes a regime
over your life, serving all sorts of purposes. It gives you moral kudos
beause everyone's dieting and you're succeeding. If all they were doing
was trying for an ideal body, then they fail miserably.
''Patients often say that it's the only thing that feels real to them,
that their other achievements have been for other people.
''I think the difficulty patients have in recovering is testimony to
how much it is involved with their sense of self; it's about someone
defining themselves as a person.''
If anorexia serves individual psychological needs, then people in any
socio-economic group, of any age or gender, under any conditions, could
potentially develop the disorder. While Gard would not go as far as to
state this unconditionally, she certainly disputes the notion that it is
more commonly found among wealthier social groups.
In a recent paper co-written with Chris Freeman, senior lecturer in
Psychiatry at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Gard claims the current
wisdom surrounding anorexia is based on first-hand impression, rather
than wider community-based studies. Health-care professionals, she
argues, are seeing teenage girls from private schools in their clinics
because they are the patients most likely to be referred. In turn, the
professional opinion of the disorder has filtered through to the general
public.
''The stereotype of anorexia is perpetrated by clinicians who only see
people referred to them,'' she explains. ''They never see the homeless,
or deprived people, so the impression they have is not representative.
''Bulimia seems to be more common in the cities than rural areas, or
more common in Western countries, but anorexia is consistent. Now that
Eastern Europe is opening up we are finding cases there as well -- where
you look for anorexia you find it.''
While there is some evidence to suggest that bulimia, first identified
in 1979, is increasing, the same cannot be said of anorexia. Even though
the disease was first clearly described in the seventeenth century,
sound methodological studies have only been conducted over the past 30
years.
''There's been a lot of debate about whether it's increasing,
especially after Twiggy in the 60s; but it's difficult really to come to
any conclusions because the studies weren't there before -- people
weren't looking for it.''
Despite the absence of facts to support the stereotypes, people will
go on expecting teenage girls to be the most likely sufferers of
anorexia, and go on blaming Kate Moss and her skinny colleagues on the
catwalk.
''People are very resistant to changing stereotypes,'' says Gard.
''They are more likely to remember that Princess Diana had an eating
disorder and associate it with someone like her. Male eating-disorders,
and those among the homeless and ethnic minorities will go on being
missed.''

IF you want to win a fortune . . . live in Linlithgow.
The biggest competition prize ever won in Scotland -- a cheque from
Littlewoods Pools for #2,069,767.60p -- was scooped yesterday by a
couple from the West Lothian town.
Their windfall came seven weeks after another couple from lucky
Linlithgow became Scotland's first National Lottery millionaires.
The latest winners, print worker Jim Grieve, 58, and his 54-year-old
wife Audrey, from the town's Mill Road, were presented with a cheque by
television personality Ruby Wax in a Glasgow hotel yesterday.
The couple, who have two married children, Allison, 27, and Roddy, 26,
did not realise they had won until a Littlewoods Pools representative
called at their home on Monday.
Speaking as she sipped champagne during a presentation ceremony, Mrs
Grieve, who paid just 60p for her winning coupon, said: ''I still can't
believe this is happening. When Jim checked his coupon on Sunday he said
he hadn't won and would have to carry on working.
''What a laugh. He was only starting his new job the next morning and
he hadn't checked my numbers.
''When I came home from work on Monday, I was confronted by a stranger
at my garden gate. When he told me he was from the pools I couldn't
believe it.''
Mr Grieve, who had just started working with a Glasgow printing
company after three months' unemployment, and his wife, a secretary with
a pharmaceutical company in Grangemouth, now plan to give up work and
enjoy their winnings.
The couple, who also spend about #5 per week on the National Lottery,
live in a three-bedroom villa, but are now considering moving to a
larger house, possibly in Perthshire, with land and stables. Mr Grieve
said he would like to treat himself to a new car.
The couple spent the early part of their married life globetrotting
when Mr Grieve worked as a Merchant Navy engineer in Kenya, Zambia,
Nigeria, and Canada. Mrs Grieve said they would like to travel again --
this time to Hong Kong and Singapore.
During the presentation ceremony she appeared constrained next to the
loquacious Ms Wax, who joked that she should ''make sure the cheque
clears and leave your husband''.
Last month, Mr Jim McGurk and his wife Joyce, of Strawberry Bank,
Linlithgow, won #1,355,975 for matching all six numbers in the National
Lottery.
* A forgetful father of six emerged yesterday as the ''missing
millionaire'' after his winning lottery ticket fell out of a book, where
he had put it for safe keeping.
There were seven winners in Saturday's #10.3m jackpot draw and
60-year-old Mr Ron Marron was the only one not to have claimed his share
of more than #1.4m.
Mr Marron, from Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, general secretary of
the Association of Metal Workers union, forgot about the ticket after
tucking it away in the book.
He only found it yesterday, when it fell out as he was leafing
through.
The winning numbers in Saturday's draw were: 48 30 40 27 38 33, with
the bonus number 02.

WHILE reading through the 1994 accounts issued by insurance giant
General Accident, I noticed that the chairman, Lord Airlie, was now 69
years of age and that the average age of the board of directors was 60
years.
This board has been instrumental in disposing of GA staff in the
50-age category (and younger) over a 10-year period as part of a company
reorganisation exercise by means of so-called ''early retiral'' or
redundancy. The numbers of staff so affected are enormous and have
mostly been kept quiet by an astute management.
It is indeed unfortunate for the ordinary staff that the privilege of
working longevity enjoyed by the directors is not extended to them. As
someone who lost his GA job and career at age 44, I find this situation
intolerable and highly offensive to say the least.
There is no excuse for rampant age discrimination in society and I,
and others, consider this to be a violation of Human Rights which must
be addressed.
Various banks and insurance companies are leading exponents of ageism
in our society. One bank was the subject of a radio programme on ageism
because it was very difficult to find a member of staff over age 35.
In addition, I have written evidence of age discrimination from a
large assurance company which told me that older recruits were not
capable of absorbing information so they were not interested in
employing anyone much over 35.
Needless to say the directors of these companies are nearly all past
their sell-by date according to their own rules. Unfortunately, the
rules only apply to the expendable ordinary staff and not to the
privileged few who pontificate from on high for the benefit of
themselves alone.
In a recent publication it was disclosed that the top-paid GA
director, Mr Nelson Robertson, earns a staggering #442,000 a year
(including perks). How old is he? Your first guess is correct -- at 61,
he is too old for employment in accordance with the rules handed down to
the rest of us.
May I record my total disgust at the hypocrisy of this organisation
and many others like it?

Ann Shaw reports on a medical procedure which promises relief for
people who suffer recurrent sinusitis
EILEEN Templeton has a small, pert face with tiny, delicate nostrils.
And that's the problem. While attractive, they have led over the years
to sinus problems. For her airways are literally too small.
As a result she has suffered from sinusitis for over 10 years.
She had tried every treatment available, ranging from home cures to
regular hospital ''wash-outs''. Nothing worked.
At work she found her condition a constant source of embarrassment:
''For years I had a constantly running nose. It was socially
unacceptable. I would be taking dictation with one hand and grabbing a
hankie to keep blowing my nose with the other,'' says 45-year-old
Eileen, who comes from Clarkston and works as a secretary for the Royal
College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow.
Now she has been cured -- thanks to a new operation developed in
Glasgow.
''My only regret is that I never had it before,'' says Eileen who was
operated on two years ago: ''It's transformed my life.'' Another bonus
is that she has not had a cold since.
She is full of praise for the surgeon, Gerry W McGarry -- an ear,
nose, and throat consultant. He has just been appointed to head a
special sinus clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, making it the first of
its kind in Scotland.
McGarry is modest about his work: ''It's a new weapon in the armoury
of treatments for sinusitis.'' He stressed it is not for everyone, but
for the small percentage of people, around 20%, who cannot be helped
using conventional therapy.
So, what does the operation involve? It's called Functional Endoscopic
Sinus Surgery, or Fess for short. This is micro-surgery carried out with
an optical fibre camera placed in the nostril, allowing the sinuses to
be viewed on a television monitor. The surgeon then has the choice of
either operating directly down the lenses of the camera or using the
television screen. McGarry chooses the former because he says it is more
accurate.
A preliminary brain scan identifies the problem area. This in itself
represents a major breakthrough since X-rays, the traditional diagnostic
tool, were of poor quality.
On average three to four such operations are carried out each week at
Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and all have been a success.
In the past many people treated with the traditional surgical approach
were not cured and found themselves labelled inappropriately as
''chronic complainers''.
Now new technology allows doctors for the first time to see exactly
the nature of the problem. ''We were able to see things which we did not
know were there. Some people had localised infections. Once these were
treated with drugs they were cured,'' says McGarry.
The technique was first developed some 10 years ago by surgeons in
Austria and America but it had unfavourable publicity because there were
a few cases of disastrous side-effects: some patients were blinded
because the surgeon had worked too close to the brain.
However, the technique perfected by McGarry in Glasgow avoids such
tragedies. He has had a 100% success rate.
Out of 100 people who go to ENT departments, 80% will be cured using
conventional medical treatment. Only about 20% need surgery. It's at
this point that Fess is considered as an alternative to traditional
surgery.
Other benefits of this operation are that there is no external
scarring and it involves only an overnight stay in hospital.
Even though the technique was first used successfully five years ago
in Glasgow, few GPs are aware of its existence, and are still referring
people for conventional treatment.
Meanwhile the demand for this kind of operation is rising. Both
rhinitis and sinusitis are on the increase world-wide along with
allergies. In fact it's the number one health-care problem in America,
closely allied to asthma.
As a result ENT departments are seeing an increase in people coming
forward wanting treatment.
Now McGarry and two colleagues, Paul White of Ninewells hospital,
Dundee, and Brian Bing of the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow, have formed
a Scottish Sinusitis Group to train other surgeons in the technique.

WHEN is insurance not insurance?
My husband and I had booked to go to Cardiff for a weekend to attend
the Congregational Federation Assembly. The cost was #230 plus #6 each
for insurance, a total of #242.
My husband took ill on the Tuesday and I cancelled the trip on the
Wednesday. He died on the Friday.
I claimed the cost of the holiday through the Travellers' Insurance
Association Ltd and received a prompt acknowledgement offering their
sympathy.
The next day I received a cheque for #160 endorsed: ''The first #70
has been deducted as per policy terms.''
So the cost of insurance is #6 only if no claim is made but #76, a
third of the total cost, should you have the temerity to die before
going on holiday.

PEOPLE should be aware that the Post Office can now provide customers
with travel insurance as well as foreign currency.
I was delighted when my travel agent arranged a bargain two-week
holiday in Italy for me, my two sisters, and three of our children.
However, when it came to travel insurance the agent wanted #100 more
than the deal offered by my local Post Office.
Thanks to the Post Office we now have another 256,000 lire to spend.

ON behalf of those of us who are concerned about the fragile ecology
and environment around the coasts of Scotland I have written to all
party leaders in Scotland to urge them to demand that the Government
prevent the bringing ashore of the Brent Spar in Scottish waters.
I believe this to be a much more dangerous option than disposal at
sea.
Let those who have convinced Shell that disposal at sea is a highly
dangerous option now suggest how to dispose of the Spar, preferably in
their own back yard.Those who feel that we should not, yet again, be a
dumping ground should write to their MPs to prevent further ecological
damage on our doorstep.

MURRAY RITCHIE in his Euroview must really be slipping if he thinks an
allegation of support for the Bank of England is an adquate put-down
when directed at opponents of European Monetary Union (June 19).
Whatever happened to all those other epithets such as ''Anglo-phobe,''
''xenophobe,'' or even ''right-wing'' with which Nationalists are
usually saddled?
How characteristic of the EU to scart round trying to find a suitable
name for a currency which will never be the unit of exchange for every
member state and may never come about at all, unless the rules are
changed dramatically and it is imposed without regard to either the
political or social consequences for the weaker and peripheral member
states' economies.
Murray Ritchie's enthusiasm for all things which stem from the EU has
blunted his analytical abilities. On the one hand he comments on ''the
British enemies of a single currency who still believe that a shared
coinage is a loss of sovereignty'' and on the other he claims that ''a
single European currency is one issue where the Scots have no
sovereignty left to lose''.
He cannot have it both ways. Either a single European currency means a
complete loss of sovereignty for participating states or Scots are
merely sharing sovereignty within the monetary union of the UK. That is
an argument which at one time would have been greeted with hoots of
derision from any Nationalist audience.
It may not matter to Murray Ritchie and the SNP that EMU would mean
macro-economic policy being taken out of the hands of elected
governments and made the responsibility of unelected bankers and
bureaucrats but they have a duty to prove that it will be to our
advantage, not an easy task in the light of the most recent estimate of
the number of jobs which could be lost thoughtout the EU if EMU were
implemented.
Past history would show that Scots could be sure of having more than
their share of those losses.
To say that because a nation lacks sovereignty in its affairs it
matters little if it never gains any, is not the most intelligent
argument to make. One can only wonder what the reaction would be if the
same argument were to be applied to equal opportunities or race
relations.

CONTRARY to Mr J Faulds (June 19) I submit that there is a prima facie
case that religion is not a dependable promoter of morality. Two reasons
for this submission are evident in the present state of things in the US
and also what has happened in the last few hundred years of our own
history.
Of all the major Western countries the US has by far the highest rate
of church attendance and by far the highest serious crime rate. It is of
course not to be inferred that church-going criminalises people but
these two facts do suggest that high-profile religion in society does
not to much to keep crime rates down.
In our own fairly recent history we have seen the mainstream churches
in decline and we have also seen a marked rise in moral responsibility.
We would not tolerate our economy today resting upon brutal race-based
slavery or upon the ruthless exploitation of child and female labour; we
do not recruit to our armed forces by resort to the press gang; we do
not inflict capital punishment, or transportation to the Antipodes, for
relatively trivial offences; we do not beat education into our children
-- and one can you go with many examples of moral scruple and ethical
practice having advanced while religion has retreated.
Again, it cannot be inferred that religion made people morally lax and
ethically insensitive in the horrific ways I have cited but it can
hardly be inferred that the then prominence of religion underscored high
moral standards.
Of course it is not enough merely to disregard religion. That is why,
in my previous letter, I wrote of ''articulation'' of liberal secular

Hakodate, Japan, Thursday
A HIJACKER armed with a screwdriver was seized when police stormed a
jumbo jet with 365 people aboard at Hakodate airport in northern Japan
today, a police spokesman said.
The hijacker, who had threatened to blow up the plane with plastic
explosives, was arrested after a brief scuffle. No explosive material
was found on the plane.
Only one person was slightly hurt by the hijacker and the rest of the
350 passengers and 15 crew were led unharmed from the All Nippon Airways
Boeing 747, Hakodate police spokesman Satoru Kakuchi said.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said he ordered the raid at 3am (1800
GMT) when he received reports that the captain of the plane was sending
frantic messages.
The raid by 50 police officers came 42 minutes later, about 15[1/2]
hours after the plane was commandeered while on a flight from Tokyo to
Hakodate, a port city on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
Officers climbed covered ladders on the starboard side of the
blue-and-white plane, entered it from three entrances and found the
hijacker with a female flight attendant in the front end of the cabin.
When a detective and three officers tried to grab him, he fought back
with the screwdriver. ''There was a scuffle which resulted in the
hijacker's T-shirt becoming bloody,'' Kakuchi said.
The raid lasted only three minutes, he added.
A relieved Murayama told reporters after the raid: ''I am very glad,
especially because I heard there were babies and a 92-year-old man
aboard the plane. I was only thinking of this.''
The hijacker was earlier thought to have been armed with an ice pick
but this turned out to be a screwdriver with a replacable head, police
spokesman Kakuchi said. The hijacker was apparently acting alone, he
added.
Police could not identity the arrested hijacker. ''His name, age, and
occupation is not known,'' Kakuchi told a news conference. ''He is
probably around 40. He is not answering questions.''
When he first held up a flight attendant on the trip, the man said he
was a member of the Aum doomsday cult, accused of the Tokyo subway nerve
attack in March, but he later denied this.
The man initially said he would demand the release of arrested guru
Shoko Asahara. As soon as the plane touched down at Hakodate, at 12.42pm
(0342 GMT), however, he changed his demand to refuelling for a flight
back to Tokyo.
What worried police most was his threat to blow up the plane. He was
seen carrying a gold-coloured vinyl bag with him but he was apparently
calling everyone's bluff.
''It was very difficult to judge if he was acting alone or if he had
any explosives,'' Murayama's spokesman Kozo Igarashi said.
The hijacker suffered a minor cut on his forehead. One officer was
also slightly hurt in the skirmish, Kakuchi said.
Seven passengers were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment for
shock and other illnesses.
The rest of the exhausted passengers were taken to nearby hotels.
''What a hateful guy,'' one middle-aged passenger said as he caught a
bus to the hotel. ''He didn't even free the women, the children or the
elderly. It was long, but it feels good now.''
Another put it more simply: ''It's great! I want to celebrate with my
daughter.''--Reuter.

I'VE heard it all now. John Macleod accusing others (Islam, in this
case) of lack of toleration while, at the same time, he's having a go at
the Roman Catholics (Papist idolaters), the Church of Scotland (not real
Proddies), and the Muslims (ignorant, misguided wogs).
Presumably, lack of space prevented him listing the faults of
Buddhists (too many arms). Episcopalians (part-time Tims), atheists (no
hope for them), Jews (even meaner than Scotsmen and responsible for the
death of our Lord), and Mormons (nice teeth and suits, shame about
everything else).
Yes, folks, the only way to enter the Kingdom of Heaven is to join the
Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland.
There must be plenty of room in Heaven.

<TEXT>
Washington, Wednesday,
THE United States has promised to pay a share of the UN rapid reaction
force for Bosnia but wants it to take a ''robust'' role in protecting
peacekeepers.
The pledge, from assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, came
as six people, including a young girl, were killed and 15 others wounded
when a shell landed in a suburb of Sarajevo.
Holbrooke said he had received tonight from Britain, France and the
Netherlands, the three main troop contributors, documents outlining
their views of the force's mission. This information has ''somewhat''
clarified the force's role, Holbrooke said.
The US endorsed the new force but Republican congressional leaders had
so far refused to help fund the operation.
The shell attack in Sarajevo struck Dobrinja, a neighbourhood where
seven people were killed and 12 wounded when a mortar bomb hit a water
queue on Sunday.
Earlier the United Nations refused to let Nato bomb a Bosnian Serb
airfield after two Serb jets violated the no-fly zone in northern
Bosnia, UN sources said.
Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic accused the UN mission of
shirking its duty by blocking the strikes.
The European Union's new mediator, former Swedish premier Carl Bildt,
who arrived in Belgrade for talks with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, expressed caution over hopes for peace but predicted UN
troops would not pull out of Bosnia.
UN relief officials in Sarajevo celebrated the arrival of the first
aid convoy in a month to reach the city where food stocks are critically
low. Two more columns of trucks were en route carrying flour, yeast and
salt, officials said.
But Bosnian government forces themselves underlined the UN's weakness,
blocking more than 500 Canadian troops in their central Bosnia base to
keep them away from nearby fighting. The soldiers were told they would
be shelled if they tried to move.
Up to 30,000 Bosnian troops backed by around 6000 Croat soldiers are
confronting 12,000--15,000 Bosnian Serb Army forces entrenched around
the Bosnian capital.--Reuter

AT a special presentation to Glasgow City Council Planning Committee
of the proposals of the Clyde Festival Gardens, 1999, we stated that we
are pleased that the Science Centre and Millennium Tower have been
passed for further consideration by the Millennium Fund, but are
concerned that its setting will not prove at all satisfactory.
A large area of the most important undeveloped site left in Glasgow,
adjoining the Science Centre, is to be sold off to a private developer.
It should be held in one ownership for the future use of the city.
Its proposed use is car-parks and offices intended to attract inward
investment. Locate in Scotland has so far not attracted any user to
Glasgow, only to New Towns. Therefore the only users likely to be
attracted are already in the city centre. The city will suffer further
denudation and subsequent demolition of good quality buildings. Out of
city centre office building will be in breach of city centre policy.
What assurance have we that the Glasgow Development Agency will
develop the dry docks as a maritime heritage centre? Where will its
revenue funding come from if it is not part of a major attraction?
There would then be three non-revenue producing components in a row.
The Science Centre, which requires an #8m endowment, the Millennium
Tower, and the Maritime Centre which GDA say is in their next tranche of
Millennium bids.
The GDA proposal is not the major tourist attraction that Glasgow
requires. The half million to two million people that it suggests will
be attracted is misleading. Tourism being the greatest industry left to
us, it is essential that this site is used to better advantage.
The car parking is very evident and is designed to bring large numbers
of commuters into the city, who will not therefore use public transport.
The same social problems will result as at the SECC car-park. It will
become a dead area at night, a muggers' paradise, and a no-go area.
There is great interest among the citizens of Glasgow who consider
something really good should happen here. This is evident from the
support that we have from all over the community, from the May Day Rally
on Glasgow Green, from the Conservative Party conference, and from
Glasgow Trades Council, representing 70,000 members, who voted
unanimously for our proposal.
All avenues should be explored into the creation of a Grade I
attraction that would support the Science Centre and a Clydebuilt
Maritime Heritage Centre. It is important that these do not become a
financial burden on the new city authority.

I AM baffled and entertained: apart from zero, why do telephone
keypads read downwards, calculators upwards?
Why, as every square metre of town greenery is devoured by yet more
and more housing, are schools merging and closing?
Why do we seek penny-pinching health care when pain and death are what
we fear above all else and would surely give our last penny to delay
them?
Why are wheel-clamps spurned by motorists? They seem ever so effective
when attached by the police.
Why are dish towels made from linen, a fabric less absorbent than
carpet tiles?
Inundated by telephone gadgetry, why is the most useful one still
missing -- the one that would ring us back the moment an engaged number
we have tried is cleared?
Perhaps readers, while airing their own enigmas, can help me reconcile
some of the above.

HAVING once again read that the term ''being economical with the
truth'' is attributable to Sir Robert Armstrong when examined during the
Spycatcher affair in Australia, let me scotch this myth.
First published in 1899, Some Experiences of an Irish RM by Somerville
and Ross contains a story entitled Trinket's Colt.
One paragraph reads as follows: ''Mrs Knox had advanced with vengeful
speed: already she was in high altercation with Flurry at no great
distance from where I lay: varying sounds of battle reached me and I
gather that Flurry was not -- to put it mildly -- shrinking from that
economy of truth that the situation required.''
I can only conclude that Sir Robert Armstrong must also have read the
tale.

BRENT SPAR is history, but not in the dismissive way implied by the
American use of that phrase -- instead it has written its name into
tomorrow's history books under three different headings: politics,
economics, and environmental concerns. Politics is the most immediately
important. There is little doubt that the Prime Minister has been
damaged by the circumstances of Shell UK's remarkable turnabout: it
occurred when he was on his feet in the House of Commons defending the
company's original position which had, after all, taken three agonising
years of consideration and assessment of expert advice to be reached.
The conclusion was to sink the huge structure in deep Atlantic waters.
Mr Major had defended it, less circumspectly, if in private, to
journalists at the G7 meeting in Canada. Exactly the same exaggerated
rhetoric of complete commitment, which left him utterly exposed when
sterling's position in the ERM became impossible three years ago, left
him in another impossible position on Tuesday. Mr Major can hardly be
entirely blamed for his fate, as perhaps the formal Shell apology to him
makes clear, but there is no mistaking the intensity of the burn he and
his Government have suffered. They have been shown to be out of touch
with popular opinion, both at home and abroad, and with the views of
their political peers in Europe, to whose own opinions Shell has
deferred. The expressed fury of Ministers is entirely understandable:
they have been placed in a humiliating position. At the very least the
incident can have done nothing to bolster Mr Major's standing with the
two electorates to which he has to appeal -- the country and, somewhat
sooner, his own back benchers.
The economic aspects are less dramatic, but they are inescapable since
it will cost about four-and-a-half times as much to decommission Brent
Spar on shore or in shallow waters. That is bad enough, yet not too
significant for Shell given the immensity of its cash flow, though it
may expect to encounter some difficulties with the taxman in the extent
to which it will be allowed to take advantage of tax offsets in meeting
the decommissioning costs. There are thought to be another 50 roughly
comparable North Sea structures facing decommissioning over the next
decade at a total cost of more than #1500m. Seven have already been left
to rust in situ. That is not a fate to be recommended, but it looks as
if deep water immersion is no longer an alternative. The offshore oil
industry and governments (not only our own) have been brought up harshly
against the enormous and unavoidable costs imposed by the earlier
successful exploitation of a rich oil province in a difficult
environment. (The parallel with the nuclear electricity industry is
obvious.) The toxic potential of these enterprises ensures that those
directly involved must be responsible for their clean-up.
The blighted landscapes of the first industrial revolution will not be
replicated offshore, one incontestable bonus of this outcome, and a
benefit of the cost. There may be other benefits in the work which
dismantling will entail, and in the experience of dealing with the many
toxic minerals known to be present in Brent Spar's considerable
accumulations of sludge. It remains perfectly possible, however, that
the environmental consequences of dealing with such toxins on land or
close inshore could themselves be severe. The jubilation at Shell's
decision in the Green lobbies may yet prove to be seriously misplaced.
This week's apparent victory for the environment is not assured. In fact
the environmental arguments are not cut and dried in favour of the new
position. It is true that questions of cost would have been ever present
in the minds of Shell planners (and Government advisers) but a long
scientific investigation preceded the eventual decision. Its reversal
was not the outcome of any change in that assessment, but rather a
response to the way in which public opinion beyond and across
international frontiers was mobilised. This environmental political
dimension may turn out to be the most long lasting of the three aspects
of the affair.
Shell has gone to some lengths to deny the significance of
Greenpeace's role in its affairs, preferring to believe that it
responded more to pressure from governments other than our own; but to
whom did these governments react? There is little doubt about the extent
of the Greenpeace success, which was owed not just to its exploiting
media coverage of events but to the threat its supporters posed to
Shell's sales, and hence profitability, in European domestic markets. A
giant multinational company has been challenged by multinational
opinion, and that company has lost.
If that seems to sum things up, it gives a wrong impression. Brent
Spar is still afloat; its eventual location is unknown. It needs towing
to a station which will protect it from the weather and ensure its safe
deconstruction. Its size means that cannot be accomplished speedily.
There are considerations about licensing its location (if in British
waters). It must seem unlikely that it can be dealt with before the
onset of winter and the attendant North Sea storms. Brent Spar has for
some time been in a doubtful condition (it was damaged in its first
placement on the sea bed) but it was previously moored, whereas now it
has some of the characteristics of a disaster waiting to happen.

Moscow, Wednesday
A PARLIAMENTARY vote of no-confidence in Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's cabinet today is likely to spark a new power struggle in
Russia, with the opposition aiming to topple President Boris Yeltsin.
The non-binding vote by the State Duma lower house carried no
immediate threat to Chernomyrdin's cabinet, under heavy fire for its
handling of a Chechen hostage crisis.
Yeltsin, who has the right to ignore the vote, quickly backed his
premier. The Russian leader can keep Chernomyrdin as an acting premier
or dissolve the Duma if it repeats the no-confidence vote within three
months.
But many Duma deputies made it clear during today's debates that
Chernomyrdin had been chosen as a whipping boy for Yeltsin, who is for
the time being out of parliament's reach.
''Chernomyrdin is only part of the executive power. We should not
forget about the leading role of the president who has finally lost his
ability to rule the country,'' said Ivan Lapshin, head of the powerful
Agrarian Party.
Communists in the Duma are collecting signatures in an attempt to
impeach Yeltsin, an initiative which has won support of deputies both
from the right and from the left.
''If there were any practical ways to impeach the president we would
support such efforts,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal
Yabloko faction and a likely candidate in 1996 presidential elections.
Many deputies also blamed the officials for bungling the latest crisis
in the southern town of Budennovsk, where Chechen rebels killed over 100
people in a raid and held more than 1000 hostages for six days.
The Duma today responded by trying to impose tighter control over the
cabinet, adopting draft laws which would allow it to hire and fire key
ministers now responsible to Yeltsin alone.
Although the government is under fire, Chernomyrdin himself was widely
praised by deputies for the protracted televised negotiations he carried
out with Chechen commander Shamil Basayev to free the hostages.
The Russian public has a tradition of supporting political martyrs and
the no-confidence vote could therefore further boost his rising personal
popularity.
Meanwhile, a senior Russian government official today disowned a
threat by the commander of Moscow's forces in Chechnya to resume attacks
on rebels in the breakaway republic, Itar-Tass news agency said.
Government press chief Viktor Konnov said General Anatoly Kulikov had
no right to say his forces might break a local ceasefire unless the
Chechens handed over the gunmen responsible for the attack on
Budennovsk.--Reuter

reports on the
discovery of a
vital gene
mutation
THE ethical anguish which has accompanied the growing potential for
genetic screening sometimes threatens to obscure the potential benefits.
This is understandable if the disease involved is incurable and the only
beneficiaries seem to be the life-insurance industry.
The other side of the story is brought home graphically in a new book
which traces the first discovery, late last year, of a gene mutation
responsible for familial breast cancer.
The existence of such a gene was first established in 1990, but it
took four years of frantic searching by several groups round the world
-- united in a common cause, divided by the urge to be first -- before
it was located and identified.
Up to 10% of breast cancer may be familial. The cumulated risk of
having breast cancer after the age of 50 is 1:430; for those with the
faulty BRCA1 gene, it is one in two.
Two years before BRCA1 was tracked down to its precise location on
Chromosome 17, specialists in the field already knew enough about its
approximate location to be able to determine whether an individual was
carrying it.
They were just in time for Susan M, a young American who was already
booked in for a prophylactic mastectomy after watching her mother, her
sisters and her cousins, all fall victim to the disease. A few days
before she was due to get her breasts cut off she learned that the
faulty gene had passed her by.
But one cousin had already had a double mastectomy five years before,
and learned that she, too, had been in the clear. Her reaction was
stoical, even philosophical. She had her life, she wouldn't pass the
genes on to her children, and the operation had given her five years of
priceless peace of mind.
Soon, once the process has been refined to make large-scale screening
practicable, women like Susan's cousin won't be taking a leap in the
dark. Their doctors will be able to tell them one way or the other.
Sadly it doesn't mean they won't get breast cancer anyway, but it is a
major breakthrough for a group of women with the highest risk.
There are other possible factors -- age at first pregnancy; dietary
fats and chemical pollutants have been blamed as contributors; even
electricity is under scrutiny -- according to one study the rare male
form of breast cancer is increased six-fold in electricians and
telephone linemen.
The book also cites research suggesting that sex improves survival
rates in breast cancer patients -- ironically perhaps, since sex may be
problematic for some women who have undergone disfiguring surgery. The
study, by American gynaecologist Dudley Chapman, was small -- 24
patients over four years -- but unequivocal.
''Three of the 24 women have died, five are now seriously ill, and the
others are doing well. The three who died had no sexual aspect to their
lives at all; the five who are very ill had little or no sexual
experience after developing the disease; whereas the remainder all have
healthy sex lives and experience regular orgasms.''
Of course, Chapman could have it the wrong way round -- maybe the
lucky 16 had regular sex lives because they recovered well from their
illness -- but he does have a theoretical biological explanation, the
release of beta-endorphons during orgasms, which increase the number of
T3 and T4 lymphocytes which the body uses to defend itself against
foreign substances.
None of this has the assurance -- welcome or unwelcome -- of a test
which says you have, or do not have, the gene. When scientists know more
about what the gene does or doesn't do, they may even be able to offer a
better alternative to having your breasts cut off as a precaution.
But the discovery has opened up a gulf in attitudes on either side of
the Atlantic. The American company which backed the BRCA1 research wants
to patent the mutant gene -- an idea that is anathema to British
scientists like Michael Stratton and Bruce Ponder, who question whether
commerce has the right to colonise the human genome in search of profit.

Cancer, by Kevin Davies and Michael White, is published by Macmillan,

Canberra, Wednesday,
THE Queen's representative in Australia, the governor-general, has
supported gay marriage and voluntary euthanasia in an unusual public
speech.
Governor-General Bill Hayden, who by convention only rarely speaks
publicly and almost never on controversial matters, said homosexual
couples should not be discriminated against.
''It is difficult to see how there can be a sustainable objection to
partnership contracts similar to marriage,'' Hayden told a doctors'
conference.
He said these couples were also already adopting children and to try
to dispute it would be pointless. ''The adoption test for them should be
the same as for other members of the community,'' said Hayden.
Hayden said he viewed his own old age with apprehension, having
visited too many nursing homes.
''This loss of personal control, of autonomy, of human personality for
me would destroy my sense of human dignity,'' he said.
''That's why I support voluntary, medically assisted euthanasia and
the provision of a living will.''
Australia's sparsely-populated Northern Territory adopted a voluntary
euthanasia law last month, causing a furious debate in states around
Australia on whether they should copy the law.
In an intensely personal speech where he referred to the deaths of
friends and relatives, Hayden also championed the rights of those with
Aids for adequate hospital care.
Prime Minister Paul Keating is campaigning to replace the Queen with
an Australian Head of State by 2001.--REUTER

New York, Wednesday,
THE mother of child actors Macaulay and Kieran Culkin went to court
today seeking temporary custody of the children and accusing their
father of trying to destroy their movie careers.
The father, Christopher Culkin, has refused to allow Kieran, 12, to
act in a movie which begins filming next week in Montana, said the
children's mother, Patricia Brentrup, in court papers.
Brentrup and Christopher Culkin, who have never married, have seven
children, aged six to 19.
Brentrup said in court papers she had ''no other choice'' but to seek
sole custody of the six minor Culkin children because their father wants
to ''pull the plug'' on Kieran's movie deal.

William Russell reports on fears that the introduction of identity
cards as a weapon against crime could be the beginning of a
''surveillance society'' in Britain
PEOPLE tend to think of identity cards as the cards with a picture
introduced during the war, which remained in use until the 1950s. They
also believe that, since many people already carry workplace identity
cards, as well as pieces of plastic for all kinds of commercial and
banking transactions, they present no dangers. The problem is that
today's ''smart'' cards can carry infinitely more information than the
old picture card, and if used for one purpose the temptation to use them
for others is overwhelming.
Hence the warning to the Government, that should it embark on the
introduction of identity cards it would be the start of ''a slippery
slope'', given yesterday in London at a conference organised by the data
protection registrar, Elizabeth France. The warning came from Peter
Hustinx, president of the Registration Chamber of the Netherlands, where
identity cards have been in operation since January.
He said that apart from the question of identity there were side
effects. ''Since you are at the top of the slope looking down, you might
as well be aware of them,'' he added. In the Netherlands people had to
have a copy of their card in their personal file at work, and it was
impossible to get a job without one. In daily practice it was also
becoming impossible to do things without some kind of documentation. A
lot of shop owners, for example, were asking people for the card.
His fears were backed up by David Flaherty, information and privacy
commissioner for British Columbia, who said cards would ''further
facilitate the operation of a surveillance society''. Experience had
shown that information made available for one purpose was likely to find
other uses.
Mrs France had called the conference as part of the discussion of the
Government's Green Paper on identity cards issued by the Home Secretary,
Michael Howard, in response to demands for their introduction at last
year's Conservative Party conference. Mrs France said it was essential,
before a firm decision was reached, that the Government clarify the
purpose of any identity card. It had been a political idea and it was
right to consider the issues raised by the Green Paper, she added. She
wanted Mr Howard to make clear his views on the privacy and data
protection issues involved because they were of key importance for the
citizen.
''There must be a clear understanding about what the information on
the card is going to be used for, that the contents are accurate, that
the information is secure, and that people are able to read and check
it,'' she said. ''These are basic data protection things. Restrictions
on wide use is very important. You could have everyone from the Inland
Revenue to the dry cleaner using the same opportunity to connect with
what you are doing.
''One of the basic risks in going for a voluntary card, without
putting the kind of safeguards in place which would be there if it was
compulsory, is it will become de facto compulsory. People will start to
ask for it, and suddenly everyone has one.''
She doubted whether cards would deal with crime as some people
suggested, but said she was reserving her views until the end of the
consultation period. What was needed from the Government were very
specific proposals about the card's use, and some kind of ''Off-card''
regulator, and there should be no haste on the Government's part to act.
It had taken seven years' debate before a card was introduced in Germany
and Holland. ''The question might look simple, but it is not,'' she
added.
Nor was it simply a case of using any existing data base. They were
full of inaccuracies because none of them was designed to serve as the
basis for an identity card system, Mrs France claimed.
If driving licences were used, then the Driver and Vehicle Licencing
Centre would have to do something about its issuing procedures.
People might feel an identity card would be useful, but they had to be
clear where the line was drawn about a card's use, and be confident that
the information was accurate and up to date.
Anitha Bondestam, director general of the data inspection board in
Sweden, which has had personal identity numbers since 1947 -- now held
on computer and used by the State -- said that everyone wanted to be
able to update their registers quickly and efficiently. Not only public
authorities, but banks, insurance companies, debt collectors, and
mail-order firms wanted to use the technology. The point had now arrived
where it was time to dig heels in, she said, but Sweden did not want to
abolish identity numbers, just limit their use.
Reservations were also expressed by Dr Alexander Dix, deputy data
protection commissioner for Berlin, who said he was very reluctant to
recommend Germany as a model. Germany had a single-purpose identity card
introduced against strong public opposition after considerable debate,
he said. If cards were introduced in Britain they should be accompanied
by legislation strengthening the rights of the citizen considerably.
The debate is not yet over. Views about the proposals set out in the
Green Paper can be submitted to Mr Howard up to September 30.
Yesterday's debate was a contribution to that process. How smart should
an identity card be? And even if set up as a one-purpose card, the
temptation to add additional purposes would be overwhelming, not simply
because Government wanted them, but because business would want them
too. It is, as Mr Hustinx said, a slippery slope.

THE organisers of a fund-raising show for Paisley flood victims are
facing a disaster of a different kind. Only 100 tickets have been sold
for Glasgow's 1800-seat King's Theatre on Sunday.
The #4000 cost of hiring the theatre will have to be paid unless the
charge is waived, or unless the public swiftly rallies round.
Prince Charles visited Paisley in the wake of the flooding which left
hundreds of families homeless earlier this year. He donated #1000 to the
hardship fund.
The Paisley Flood Action Committee has been in touch with his aides to
invite him along to Sunday's show.
Ms Fiona Meikle, of the committee, said last night: ''We have spoken
to staff at the Prince's office and so far they have not ruled out the
possibility that he might come along on Sunday. They are looking at his
schedule.''
The event's co-ordinator, singer Terry Neason, was confident of a
last-minute rush. ''We have a first-class line-up of acts all donating
their services free of charge. We are just hoping the public will turn
out in large numbers.''
The stars giving their services include Andy Cameron, Dorothy Paul,
Gregor Fisher, and Tony Roper.

OFFICIAL figures which suggest the number of homeowners caught in
negative equity in Scotland had increased by more than 600% in a few
months yesterday produced anger from the housing market and ''caution''
from the Government.
They were dismissed by building societies and estate agents in
Scotland.
A Government spokesman admitted they ''were at best estimates . . .
based on number crunching''.
Junior Environment Minister Robert Jones, in a Commons written reply
on Tuesday, said the number of homeowners caught in the trap whereby
their homes were worth less than their mortgage had increased by more
than 200,000 in Britain in the first quarter of this year.
He said that in Scotland the number of homes affected had rocketed
from 8520 in the last quarter of last year to 53,000 in the first few
months of this year. Only Wales and the West Midlands had seen a drop,
the Minister said.
The most recent figures available on negative equity in Scotland,
based on a Newcastle University study and announced by Scottish Housing
Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton in February, in fact, show
increases of 2.13% in 1991, 1.1% in 1992, and 4.65% in 1993.
A spokesman for the Department of the Environment in London, asked to
comment on the figures, which were compiled in co-operation with the
Bank of England, said yesterday: ''They amounted to number crunching
based on x-amount of money that had been borrowed by homeowners.
''It is not a question of overstating the case. They are at best
estimates based on statistical models and, as such, should be treated
with caution.''
He said the department and the Bank of England were looking at the way
the figures are compiled to see if the results reached through the
number crunching could be validated.
The figures were dismissed by building society and estate agent chiefs
north of the Border, who claimed negative equity was a ''fairly limited
problem'' in Scotland.
The Scottish Office also appeared to ridicule the figures. A
spokeswoman said the DoE had made it clear that its assumptions may have
''overstated'' the number of negative equity cases.
She added: ''The Scottish Office accepts that such estimates can
produce a useful broad indication of negative equity at UK level and in
some areas, such as South-east England.
''We would not, however, take them as an accurate guide to the extent
of negative equity in Scotland because of the amount of fluctuation from
quarter to quarter.''
Mr Barry Swanson, secretary of the Building Societies
Association/Council of Mortgage Lenders committee for Scotland,
questioned the figures and added: ''It is not the general perception of
building societies in Scotland that negative equity is a problem.''
His views were supported by Mr David Chalmers, deputy chief executive
of Dunfermline Building Society, who said he was not convinced by the
figures. ''The statement about negative equity in Scotland is certainly
not borne out by our experience,'' he said.
Mr Alan Baxter, corporate manager with Slater, Hogg, and Howison,
Scotland's largest estate agent with 33 branches, said: ''Our experience
is that negative equity is not a major issue in Scottish property at
present and has not been for a while. Where it has been in evidence it
has been localised. It is mostly a southern England phenomenon.''
He said there was some evidence of negative equity problems, for
instance, in some parts of Westerwood in Cumbernauld where, in several
cases, the price paid for a new house had not ''stacked up'' to the
resale value. Prices range from #100,000 to #180,000 on the estate which
has become established on the edge of the new town in the past few
years.
Mr Baxter said: ''The people who have suffered from negative equity in
our experience are primarily those who have bought new homes who have
been forced to sell them soon after, or those at the very top end of the
market -- #150,000-plus -- where the prices of their properties have
fallen.''

<HEADLINE>Lack of accord with ruling body fires up Shotts. Expulsion threat to junior football club.</HEADLINE>

ONE of Scotland's best known junior football clubs is faced with the
threat of being kicked out of the league in a bitter legal dispute with
its ruling body.
Shotts Bon Accord is determined to take the case to the Scottish
Football Association, if necessary, to clear its name and test the SFA's
internal disputes system.
It may become an important test of the legal right of bodies like the
SFA to run their own affairs, free from interference by the courts.
The row between Shotts and the central region of the Scottish Junior
Football Association goes back to last Hogmanay, when Shotts cancelled a
MBM Cup game against Thorniewood after producing medical certificates
stating that eight players had flu.
At a meeting on February 14, central region decided to fine the club
#500 and ban it from taking any further part in the cup competition. It
found that there was ''conflicting evidence'' over the validity of the
medical certificates.
Shotts, the cup-holders, were granted an interim interdict in the
Court of Session to ban Thorniewood from playing in the next round, and
the cup competion was eventually scrapped for 1994/95.
Central region has now apparently conceded, on legal advice, that
although it conducted an authorised investigation in good faith into the
issue of the medical certificates, it failed to follow the rules of
natural justice.
However, Shotts has now received a letter informing the club that
central's management committee has decided to press a further charge --
that of raising proceedings in the Court of Session when internal
procedures existed to resolve the dispute.
The region will be asked to decide whether the club has been guilty of
misconduct, a breach of regulations, or of any act prejudicial to the
interests of the local association, in particular by raising a public
court action when the dispute could have been dealt with internally.
In a letter to Shotts' match secretary, central region has reminded
the club ''for avoidance of any doubt'' that if it is found guilty of
misconduct or behaviour contrary to the interests of the SJFA, it can be
fined or even expelled.
The charge is due to be ''spoken to'' at the central region's AGM next
Wednesday, with Shotts being given a chance to respond.
Shotts is furious with the latest turn of events and club president
Gavin Pettigrew's anger was evident in a letter he wrote to the general
secretary of the SJFA, central region.
It states: ''I hope the #500 fine, which we promptly paid after your
earlier illegal decision was imposed, will be returned forthwith.''
Mr Pettigrew expresses his pleasure that the management committee has
acted on legal advice and ''that you are now satisfied that your
decision of February 14 deviated from natural justice and is therefore
to be treated as null, void, and of no effect.
''What is distinctly missing is any form of apology.''
It goes on: ''While we welcome your decision to recall your illegal
decision of February 14, such a course of action does not clear this
club's name.
''All sorts of stories have been circulating within football as to
what Shotts 'was guilty of' in connection with the cancellation of the
Thorniewood game, but the fact of the matter is that this club was not
charged with any wrongdoing surrounding that matter.
''The whole issue has been distorted to such a degree that it is now
generally believed that we forged medical certificates to get the game
called off.''
Shotts is demanding that the charge against it, of going to the Court
of Session without exhausting internal procedures, is now dropped.
Failing that, it will formally request that the dispute is settled at
the highest level by the Scottish Football Association, whose rules
forbid members from resorting to a court of law without the prior
approval of the SFA.
Recently, the SFA's disputes procedures were used to settle the
wrangle between Celtic and Kilmarnock over the poaching of Tommy Burns
and Billy Stark.
A tribunal headed by Lord MacLean, the High Court and Court of Session
judge, ordered Celtic to pay Kilmarnock #200,000.

Brussels
A HARDENING of opposition to the decommissioning of weapons by the IRA
was expressed by Mr Martin McGuinness on the eve of today's meeting
between Irish Taoiseach Mr John Bruton and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein.
Mr Bruton has been pressing Mr Adams to make a ''gesture'' towards
decommissioning weaponry and explosives so that the peace process can
move forward.
But in Brussels yesterday Mr McGuinness, party NEC member and
effectively Mr Adams's deputy, said even a symbolic handing over of arms
would be seen by the nationalist and republican movement in Ireland as a
surrender.
''It would cause tension and division and would cause the deaths of
republicans, nationalists, and loyalists, in my opinion,'' he said. ''It
would also lead ultimately to the death of the peace process.'' He
repeatedly attacked the British Government which, he said, was blocking
the peace process for ''incomprehensible'' reasons, using the issue of
decommissioning as an excuse.
Mr Bruton is due to press Mr Adams on decommissioning today, with the
support of Mr John Major. Sinn Fein is particularly annoyed that Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, has refused a request
from Mr Adams for a meeting.
Mr McGuinness was in Brussels for the opening of an office by Sinn
Fein, which is seeking closer political contacts inside the European
Union.
By demanding the surrender of weaponry the British were seeking the
defeat of the IRA in peacetime after being unable to win a 25-year war,
Mr McGuinness said.
Asked how long he thought the negotiating process should take, Mr
McGuinness said: ''Off the top of my head -- three to six months would
be quite sufficient for all parties to get to the table and hammer out a
settlement.'' This meant there could a deal by the end of this year if
only the British would drop their demands for decommissioning, he
argued.
When the talks got going there would be an ''irreversible'' thrust --
''and the unionists know it''. But the peace process was at a critical
stage and unless talks started soon it could fail.
Even minor concessions with ageing IRA weaponry and unstable
explosives would be a symbolic surrender, he said. ''That is how it
would be seen. That is what this is about. It is as though the British
Government would be getting a public admission that only the IRA was
responsible for all the events of the last 25 years.''
He said there was no precedent for any side in an armed conflict
having to disarm before peace talks.
Mr McGuinness recalled the IRA's secret meeting in the 1970s with the
then Northern Ireland Secretary William (now Lord) Whitelaw. ''The idea
was never even mentioned,'' he said.

THE Prime Minister last night backed ex-prisoners of war and civilian
internees in their campaign for an apology and compensation from the
Japanese Government.
In a 30-minute meeting at Downing Street, he told representatives that
he would help them to secure a meeting with Premier Tomiichi Murayama in
Tokyo next month.
Senior officials at No 10 said the Prime Minister expressed his ''very
strong sympathy'' for their horrific sufferings at the hands of the
Japanese.
He pledged to continue raising with the Japanese the controversial
issues of compensation and an official apology.
Thousands of ex-PoWs and civilian internees are seeking one-off
payments of #14,000 through the Japanese courts, as well as a formal
apology.
They also believe Britain should block any move to allow Japan a seat
on the United Nations Security Council until the apology and
compensation have been delivered.
''In legal terms, the question of compensation was settled by the 1951
San Francisco treaty but there is a moral case and the Prime Minister
does have strong sympathy,'' said a Downing Street source.
Mr Keith Martin, chairman of the Association of British Civilian
Internees -- Far East Region, said after the meeting: ''We are very
pleased Mr Major is continuing to raise this issue.
''He said he would help in so far as he is able. He is aware of the
strength of our feelings.''
Mr Arthur Titherington, secretary of the Japanese Labour Camp
Survivors Association of Great Britain, pledged to continue the fight
until all the survivors of the internment camps are dead.
''We will go on for as long as it takes,'' he said. ''Meeting the
Prime Minister at No 10 means we are that much closer to getting what we
want and I'm optimistic of gaining the support of the British
government.
''There is no real point in going to Japan without that support from
our own Government. I now hope this Government will be behind us.''
The organisations presented an emotive open letter to the Prime
Minister asking for his help.
It stated: ''As we approach the 50th anniversary, the memories of our
fallen comrades, of those who have died since our release from
captivity, and of those who still bear the torment of those terrible
years of suffering burn increasingly brightly in our minds and hearts.''
''We will not rest until justice has been done, and has been seen to
be done.''
Representatives are due to fly to Japan next month to attend court
hearings and meet leading Japanese politicians.
During a co-ordinated day of action, representatives presented a
letter to the charge d'affaires at the Japanese Embassy in London and
handed in a 150,000-signature petition to Parliament.

EDINBURGH District Council is set to take the stage today in a wrangle
over the capital's operatic diet.
Scottish Opera has been accused of opposing visits to the city by
other touring companies at the showpiece Festival Theatre, Edinburgh's
purpose-built opera house.
Earlier this year, the manager of the theatre claimed that Scottish
Opera's stance had scuppered three visits by opera companies to
Edinburgh in less than 12 months.
Today, members of the council's policy and resources committee will be
asked to write to Scottish Opera, expressing concern at its stance.
A report by Mr Roger Jones, executive director of recreation, advises
members: ''Scottish Opera has objected to visiting opera companies
appearing at both the Festival Theatre and the King's Theatre.
''Discussions are currently taking place between the Festival Theatre
and Scottish Opera in an attempt to resolve the issue.''
The report recommends that the council should write to Scottish Opera
to remind them that its multi-million pound stake in the Festival
Theatre was made on the understanding that visiting opera companies
would be a regular feature of the theatre programme.
Councillor Lesley Hinds, chair of the policy and resources committee
and a member of the Festival Theatre Trust, said there was concern from
both that the theatre should not be a forum just for Scottish Opera.
''The theatre should cater for all tastes and all types of opera. We
are not getting that by Scottish Opera's stand.
''Our concern particularly is that the Festival Theatre has a varied
type of programme. We do not expect there just to be Scottish Opera.
That appears to be what Scottish Opera are wishing to do,'' she said.
Ms Hinds warned that the authority's #75,000 grant over two years to
Scottish Opera could be reviewed if council concerns were not taken on
board.
Mr Richard Jarman, general director of Scottish Opera, said the
company adhered to the Arts Council's Spheres of Influence policy,
designed 20 years ago to avoid repertoire and performance clashes by
touring companies, which also allowed each company a designated
''sphere''.
He said: ''Scottish Opera's is Scotland and the North-east of England.
In effect, just as Scottish Opera would not be at liberty to tour into,
for example, Cardiff, neither would Welsh National Opera tour into
Edinburgh, without prior agreement between the two opera companies.
''This policy has been enormously successful in helping to increase
audiences across the British Isles.''
Mr Jarman admitted that the company was ''mindful'' of its
irregularity in appearing in Edinburgh but planned to increase its
visits to the capital from 1996/97.
Meanwhile, a big touring stage show starring Jason Donovan, set to
come to Scotland early next year, has been scrapped. Only last week, the
Australian star was in Edinburgh to promote the show, Billy, planned for
the Festival Theatre.
However, the theatre was told yesterday that the musical -- based on
the day-dreams of the character Billy Liar -- would not be going ahead.
The production firm behind the show said technical problems concerning
the set for the show had forced its cancellation in all seven venues
across Britain.

BRITAIN is not a ''milch cow'' for foreign benefits cheats, a judge
said yesterday as he jailed 11 of 14 Irish defendants for defrauding
social security and various local councils of more than #1m in benefits.
''This was a very skilful fraud on the public purse,'' Judge George
Bathurst-Norman told Isleworth Crown Court, putting most blame on the
one missing defendant. Noel O'Sullivan, 45, thought to be back in the
Republic, ''undoubtedly orchestrated this case overall'', he said.
The year-long investigation that led to the arrests started when
benefits clerks reported an unusual number of birth certificates
originating from one register office in Limerick.
Investigators discovered ''a large-scale fraud, principally on the DSS
but also on local authorities in respect of housing benefit'', said Mr
David Paget QC, prosecuting.
Jailing 11 of the defendants for between nine months and
two-and-a-half years, Judge Bathurst-Norman said: ''The total loss to
the taxpayers of this country came to more than #1.1m.''

IF you want to win a fortune . . . live in Linlithgow.
The biggest competition prize ever won in Scotland -- a cheque from
Littlewoods Pools for #2,069,767.60p -- was scooped yesterday by a
couple from the West Lothian town.
Their windfall came seven weeks after another couple from lucky
Linlithgow became Scotland's first National Lottery millionaires.
The latest winners, print worker Jim Grieve, 58, and his 54-year-old
wife Audrey, from the town's Mill Road, were presented with a cheque by
television personality Ruby Wax in a Glasgow hotel yesterday.
The couple, who have two married children, Allison, 27, and Roddy, 26,
did not realise they had won until a Littlewoods Pools representative
called at their home on Monday.
Speaking as she sipped champagne during a presentation ceremony, Mrs
Grieve, who paid just 60p for her winning coupon, said: ''I still can't
believe this is happening. When Jim checked his coupon on Sunday he said
he hadn't won and would have to carry on working.
''What a laugh. He was only starting his new job the next morning and
he hadn't checked my numbers.
''When I came home from work on Monday, I was confronted by a stranger
at my garden gate. When he told me he was from the pools I couldn't
believe it.''
Mr Grieve, who had just started working with a Glasgow printing
company after three months' unemployment, and his wife, a secretary with
a pharmaceutical company in Grangemouth, now plan to give up work and
enjoy their winnings.
The couple, who also spend about #5 per week on the National Lottery,
live in a three-bedroom villa, but are now considering moving to a
larger house, possibly in Perthshire, with land and stables. Mr Grieve
said he would like to treat himself to a new car.
The couple spent the early part of their married life globetrotting
when Mr Grieve worked as a Merchant Navy engineer in Kenya, Zambia,
Nigeria, and Canada. Mrs Grieve said they would like to travel again --
this time to Hong Kong and Singapore.
During the presentation ceremony she appeared constrained next to the
loquacious Ms Wax, who joked that she should ''make sure the cheque
clears and leave your husband''.
Last month, Mr Jim McGurk and his wife Joyce, of Strawberry Bank,
Linlithgow, won #1,355,975 for matching all six numbers in the National
Lottery.
* A forgetful father of six emerged yesterday as the ''missing
millionaire'' after his winning lottery ticket fell out of a book, where
he had put it for safe keeping.
There were seven winners in Saturday's #10.3m jackpot draw and
60-year-old Mr Ron Marron was the only one not to have claimed his share
of more than #1.4m.
Mr Marron, from Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, general secretary of
the Association of Metal Workers union, forgot about the ticket after
tucking it away in the book.
He only found it yesterday, when it fell out as he was leafing
through.
The winning numbers in Saturday's draw were: 48 30 40 27 38 33, with
the bonus number 02.

A POLICEMAN'S notebook, which, it is alleged, should have been
produced in the George Beattie murder trial as best evidence, has been
traced after 22 years.
Campaigners Jimmy Hood, MP for Clydesdale, and Mr Peter Hill, formerly
of BBC's Rough Justice, believe the contents of the notebook are
sufficiently important to merit the case being referred to the Appeal
Court for a third time.
Mr Hill claims it ''proves that an important piece of evidence against
Beattie was fabricated''.
The vital notebook belonged to one of the officers in the case, Mr
Lewis Johnston, now 62, who was traced by Mr Hill to a Scottish west
coast village where he lives in retirement. According to Mr Hill, Mr
Johnston was the officer who was put in charge of Beattie throughout the
12-hour period when he made the admissions to the police which
eventually led to his conviction.
Beattie, a former steelworker, was jailed for life for the murder of
Margaret McLaughlin, 23, in a wooded glen near Carluke station in 1973.
He served 13 years in prison before being released, only to be recalled
after a minor breach of the peace after six years of freedom.
A campaign to establish his innocence, alleging that he was ''fitted
up'' by Lanarkshire police officers, succeeded in having the case
referred back to the Appeal Court only for the court to decide there had
been sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction.
Mr Hill says Mr Johnston's job was to guard Beattie and take down
everything he said.
He questions why his notebook was not presented to the
procurator-fiscal by the senior officers running the case: and now says
he has been told by Mr Johnston that he was never asked for the
notebook. When asked in court about notes, he said that his partner,
Sergeant Mortimer, had made notes.
Mr Hill says: ''Johnston's notebook is by far the most comprehensive
record of what happened to Beattie buring his 12-hour interrogation. The
reason it was kept secret is obvious. It proves that an important piece
of evidence against Beattie was fabricated.''
Mr Hill says two senior officers claimed Beattie gave a damning
description of the knife that was the supposed murder weapon but he
alleges that Beattie did not and that Mr Johnston's notebook proves
this. Beattie denied giving the description and the only evidence of
this was a note taken by one of them, DCI Gold.
Beattie's lawyers had no means of challenging this until now. Mr Hill
alleges that Mr Gold, now dead, lied to convict George Beattie and that
there was a conspiracy, in which Mr Johnston had no part, to suppress
the notebook.
Mr Hood will disclose new moves in the case in London today. In March,
he says, he received assurances from Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the
Scottish Minister of State, regarding new evidence he had presented to
him in confidence. Lord James had said there would be an investigation
into allegations about the police conduct in the case.
''The Minister also assured me he would try to obtain a certain
policeman's notebook I had brought to his attention and he said he would
put it into safe keeping,'' Mr Hood told The Herald.
''We are now two months into this inquiry into the conduct of the
Lanarkshire police. I have asked for information and have so far been
told very little as to what they have done.
''The policeman's notebook is vital. George Beattie's solicitor should
have a copy of it. The Scottish people must be made aware that the
Lanarkshire police deliberately withheld an important piece of best
evidence from the prosecution and the defence in this case.
''The policeman who was detailed to make the comprehensive note of
what happened during the 12 hours when the entire case against Beattie
was stitched together was not allowed to present his record of what
happened.
''I believe this was because his record, the authentic full record of
the events, did not match the facts that the police wanted the jury to
hear.''
Mr Hood claims Lord James will not tell him if the authorities already
have the notebook.
''I know they have interviewed the policeman concerned. Perhaps he is
playing for time hoping that a Cabinet reshuffle or a General Election
will save him but there has been enough delay in the Beattie case,'' he
said.
Mr Hood also said yesterday that the Parliamentary Commissioner, the
Ombudsman, had now taken a historic decision to investigate the actions
of the Crown Office in relation to what Mr Hood alleges are undue delays
in investigating the Beattie case.
''I have always said that the Crown Office has deliberately and
flagrantly delayed matters in Beattie's case in the hope that delay
alone might kill it. They held out against him until the witnesses he
needed to call were all dead,'' Mr Hood declared.

<HEADLINE>Executive pay inquiry chairman enjoys a 17% rise of his own</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977764583</RECORDNO>

THE man heading the top-level investigation into ''excessive''
executive pay received a 17% wage rise last year, it has been disclosed.
The revelation prompted another broadside from Labour against the
Government's handling of complaints of boardroom excess.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of retail giant Marks and Spencer, saw
his pay package increase to #807,000 -- made up of a salary of #637,000,
profit-sharing of #32,000, a #127,000 bonus and other benefits worth
#11,000.
His pay package in the previous year was #689,000, which included a
#59,000 bonus.
Labour said there was bound to be public concern over Sir Richard's
pay rise because of his position on the review committee.
He was named as chairman of the committee set up by the Confederation
of British Industry earlier this year in a bid to tackle the controversy
over top people's pay after the 75% rise awarded to British Gas chief
executive Mr Cedric Brown.
The revelation of Sir Richard's 17% pay rise came after the disclosure
that a power company chief was given a huge rise last year in the teeth
of the controversy over boardroom ''greed''.
PowerGen chief executive Mr Ed Wallis enjoyed a salary rise of 15%,
three times as much as the company's workers. His overall pay package
was swollen to #461,000.
Labour claimed that with the addition of executive shares, Mr Wallis
received an effective pay rise of 42% in the last financial year.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, who has campaigned against so-called
''fat-cat'' pay in the privatised utilities, said PowerGen had responded
to public anger ''with contempt''.
He added: ''Their response to criticism has been to make things worse,
piling excess on to excess.''
The annual report of Marks and Spencer, published today, shows Sir
Richard cashed in 40,000 share options last year, netting him a #90,000
profit.
During the year he was granted 166,000 share options, which cannot be
cashed in for at least three years. Labour said the share options held
by Sir Richard were worth almost #1m.Shadow Chief Secretary to the
Treasury Andrew Smith said: ''There is bound to be public concern over
this, given that Sir Richard is heading the inquiry into boardroom
excess.
''It will fuel public demand that the Government must take decisive
action over utility bosses' pay, as Labour has constantly argued.''
Sir Richard said when he was appointed to the CBI committee in January
that he was confident it could propose practical ways forward which
would attract wide support.
The committee, which includes leading industrialists such as Whitbread
chairman Sir Michael Angus, BP chief executive David Simon, and ICI
chairman Sir Denys Henderson, is due to publish its recommendations next
month.
Marks and Spencer, which has 53,000 UK workers and 292 stores, made
#924m profit last year. The company said its sales staff received the
best pay package in the high street, with a sales assistant earning an
average weekly wage of #166.
0 PowerGen's annual report showed that Mr Wallis's salary rose from
#268,000 to #294,000 last year and his profit-related bonus jumped from
#69,000 to #105,000.
He was also paid #9000 in other benefits and #53,000 in pension
contributions from the company, taking his total package to #461,000
compared to #400,000 the previous year.
Mr Wallis said earlier this year that he was ''worth every penny'' of
his pay. He also stunned a committee of MPs investigating executives'
salaries when he said that he had three other ''little'' jobs bringing
in an extra #36,000 a year.
Mr Gordon Brown said: ''Sir Richard's award makes it all the more
important that it is the Government that takes action on utility
boardroom excesses and not palm off its responsibility to a CBI
committee.''

<TEXT>
SHOWJUMPER Harvey Smith was reminded yesterday of the night when three
amateur footballers died after their car ploughed into his horsebox.
Mr Smith, 58, who was driving the transporter, was not called to say
what he saw on that fatal night, he merely listened to evidence at an
inquest in Harrogate, Yorkshire.
Police accident examiner Mr Michael Natt told the inquest there would
always be a question mark over what happened in the two or three seconds
before the crash.
The men who died, all from Yorkshire, were the car driver, Mr Andrew
Gowland, 30, a printer, of Seacroft, Leeds; Mr Ernest Larvin, 37, a
school caretaker, of Knaresborough; and Mr Gary Hayton, 31, a leisure
centre manager, of Garforth, Leeds.
They were killed instantly when their Ford Escort hit the rear of the
horsebox as it drove away from a junction.
Witnesses said Mr Smith halted and then pulled out of the A1 slip road
junction with the A59 Harrogate to York road at Allerton Park, when the
headlights of the approaching car were half a mile away.
PC Natt said that, for some reason, Mr Gowland did not see the big red
horsebox until he was almost upon it. He said tests showed the Escort
was travelling at about 40mph.
The men who died played for local team Hammerton United but, on the
dayof the crash, their game had been called off because of bad weather
and they were travelling home.
Also in the car were Mr Larvin's six-year-old son, Daniel, who was
seriously injured, and Mr Andrew Fulcher, 17, a student, who suffered
only a cut finger. Mr Fulcher, of Knaresborough, told the inquest he
could remember very little about the crash.
He said he had no complaints with Mr Gowland's driving and rejected
suggestions by Mr Jeremy Storey, QC, appearing for Mr Smith, that he had
told people the driver had been doing 100mph shortly before the tragedy.
He told the inquest: ''I can remember hearing braking and then
everything happened so suddenly -- I was lucky. I saw the horsebox at a
slight angle across the road and then came the impact.''
Earlier evidence showed that none of the men had been drinking. They
died from multiple injuries.
The inquest was adjourned until today.

<HEADLINE>Nolan inquiry will take in Monklands. Labour attacks Lang call</HEADLINE>

LORD NOLAN'S continuing inquiry into standards in public life will
take in allegations of corruption in Monklands District Council -- but
not until next year at the earliest.
Although he will accept Professor Robert Black's report as evidence
when he comes to consider local government next year, Lord Nolan made
clear that he is not empowered to investigate specific cases.
His involvement, however passing, would increase to five the number of
studies of the murky world of Monklands politics -- the original Labour
Party study, the Black report, the new Labour Party investigation, the
Nolan Committee and now the Commons Scottish Select Affairs Committee,
which decided yesterday to look into the affair. On top of all that,
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang is still considering whether he should
sanction a full public inquiry into Monklands.
Mr Lang wrote to Lord Nolan after publication of Professor Black's
report, enclosing a copy of the report, and suggesting that Lord Nolan
might want to look into the matter.
He said: ''The Labour Party carried out an internal inquiry two years
ago. Although they have not released publicly the evidence gathered
during that process, it may be that they would agree to release it to
you should you request it, to enable you to consider matters further.''
In reply, Lord Nolan made it clear that Mr Lang's request was not a
matter of priority. The next areas of study would be local public
spending bodies and the House of the Lords and it was hoped to complete
work on these around next Easter.
After that the committee would consider other topics for study, and it
had indicated that it had in mind consideration of local government
management issues.Lord Nolan told Mr Lang: ''While the committee's remit
does not include investigating individual cases, the Black report will
certainly form part of the evidence when we do come to local government
and I am grateful to you for sending it to me.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary Mr George Robertson accused Mr Lang of
staging a ''cheap stunt'' and added: ''Labour has acted sharply and
decisively to clean up its patch, and it is a pity that Lord Nolan was
prevented from spotlighting the dirt which has been swept under the Tory
funding carpet.''
Meanwhile, the all-party Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee,
which scrutinises the work of the Scottish Office, yesterday decided in
principle to carry out its own investigation into the Monklands case.
The committee, which has a Tory majority, made its decision in
private. Later, Tory committee members Mr Raymond Robertson (Aberdeen
South) and Mr Tim Devlin (Stockton South) said a final decision would be
taken next week.
As the Tories continued to try to make maximum political capital out
of the Monklands affair, Scottish party chairman Sir Michael Hirst
called for the Shadow Scottish Secretary to resign.
He said: ''George Robertson claims Labour is now investigating their
councillors to find those who have brought their party into disrepute
and to find out what the truth is.
''But there is an inescapable conclusion to be drawn that Mr Robertson
must have known, or ought to have known, what some of his Labour
colleagues were really up to in Monklands.
''In view of the robust action taken by the Labour Party in London,
George Robertson should offer his resignation as Shadow Secretary of
State for Scotland.''
Conservative Party chairman Jeremy Hanley said yesterday that the
action taken by Labour in suspending its councillors was ''too little,
too late''.
He said: ''The Labour Party, demanding almost daily independent public
inquiries into a wide range of issues, orders only internal inquiries
into the activities of at least nine of its own Labour councils and
constituency parties, including Birmingham and Manchester.
''After the fiasco in Monklands, Labour must order individual public
inquiries into these rotten burghs so that the full facts are known and
appropriate action can be taken.''
SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond joined the chorus of criticism, writing to
Mr Tony Blair to ask when he was first aware of the allegations and why
he did nothing at the time; if the new Labour investigation will look at
the original party whitewash; whether those who knew about the scandal
but failed to act will be disciplined; what the position of Mr Tom
Clarke is; and whether the Monklands councillors on the North
Lanarkshire authority are still Labour councillors.
The answer to that last question is yes. They cannot be stripped of
their Labour status on the other authority until the full national
executive committee meets to discuss the matter next Wednesday. That
meeting will also appoint a senior party official, probably someone
London-based, to conduct the new inquiry, whose remit is ''to
investigate and report on any action required'' in the light of the
Black report.
Monklands Provost Eric Burns yesterday criticised the Black report.
''There are 104,000 people in Monklands,'' he said. ''I have not seen
masses of people outside the chamber calling for my or any other
resignations.''
He criticised the #50,000 report for making unsupported allegations
and said people should have been identified. While allegations that
councillors broke the code of conduct by not declaring interests should
be investigated, other complaints were highlighted without comment, he
said.
''The professor has made statements . . . and gives no conclusion,''
said Mr Burns. ''That is something seriously lacking with it. Surely if
you put things like that in your report you should answer it.
''So if you get an inconclusive report, a report that does not name
names, the Labour Party chose to suspend us. Now I am aggrieved at that,
because in the eyes of the public they effectively in all probability
think 'Here's Eric Burns, he's a crook' -- that can be the perception.
''I have had loads of people on to me giving support but, the fact of
the matter is, at the moment, I am tarnished and so is the council.''
The provost will be chairing a special meeting tomorrow evening to
discuss the report.

FORTY-eight hours into corruption revelations surrounding the Labour
party in Coatbridge and Airdrie, the local MP at the centre of the
controversy was still nowhere to be found.
Former Shadow Scottish Secretary Tom Clarke has refused to comment in
the wake of the Black report.
Over the telephone from his London base, he told his secretary in his
Monklands West constituency at 9.20am that he had a taxi waiting and was
heading for an appointment. Thereafter, he was seen heading across the
Thames over Lambeth Bridge.
He had pleaded with fellow MPs the previous evening to say that, if
journalists were trying to contact him, they had not seen him. Reporters
had earlier got the message as he slipped out of a lobby into an area
where they could not follow him.
Numerous messages were taken at his House of Commons office yesterday
with the promise that they would be passed on. Assurances were given:
''I am sure he will return the call.''
But there was no follow-up. Nor was there any response from messages
passed through his pager.
Mr George Robertson, his successor as Shadow Scottish Secretary,
wanted to see him yesterday on another matter but as Mr Clarke was not
in the House of Commons yesterday, that too had to go by the board.
Pressure has been put on by senior colleagues, who have told him that,
by running for cover and refusing to speak to the media, he is only
making matters worse for the party. Nevertheless, Mr Clarke again spent
yesterday desperately evading a press pack convinced they scented
political blood.
As other political parties criticised his role in the affair, there
were fleeting glimpses of the Monklands East MP but by last night he had
gone to ground once more.
SNP leader Alex Salmond and Scottish Conservative chairman Sir Michael
Hirst both turned the spotlight on Mr Clarke. Sir Michael, who called on
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson to resign over the affair,
criticised Mr Clarke.
He said: ''As one of the Monklands MPs and a former provost, Mr Clarke
consistently and publicly defended the Labour members of the council,
branding the allegations now substantiated in the Black report as
'McCarthyite smears'.
''If Labour is truly the 'new' party it claims, will he now be
suspended pending inquiries into his stance in this disgraceful
episode?''
Mr Salmond, in a letter to Labour leader Tony Blair, also cast doubt
on Mr Clarke's political future for having continued to deny that there
was any substance to allegations even after his party leadership
conceded that they required investigation.
However, the subject of all this criticism continued to keep his head
down.
Prime Minister John Major had attempted in the House of Commons to
elicit the views of the local MP on this alleged scandal but to no
avail. Yesterday, The Herald fared no better. Mr Clarke was not speaking
to us.
Friends in the House had advised him that, sooner or later, he would
have to voice an opinion. ''Presumably Tom Clarke will speak in his own
time,'' Mr Robertson had declared.
If anybody should have a view on the alleged corruption scandals in
Monklands, then it is Mr Clarke. He is Monklands Man. He became a
councillor in 1964 and rose through the ranks of local politics to
become provost in 1975, a post to which he was twice re-elected and from
which he first brought current leader Jim Brooks on to the council.
Mr Clarke served as president of Cosla and was honoured with a CBE
before he got his chance at Westminster with the death of Mr Jimmy
Dempsey as MP for the area. He then rose through the Parliamentary party
to become Shadow Scottish Secretary under the national leadership of his
constituency neighbour John Smith but dropped out of the limelight
through illness and an apparent inability to cope with the office.
The future of one and the memory of the other is damaged by the Black
report, particularly since Mr Clarke's damaging intervention in the
by-election campaign last year to disown comments made by candidate
Helen Liddell that there had indeed been a spending imbalance between
Airdrie and Coatbridge.
If Labour lost to the SNP, said a colleague at the time, Mr Clarke
would be guilty of murder. If they held on, he would be guilty of
manslaughter.
As it was, his intervention alleging ''McCarthyite smears'' was enough
to set him at loggerheads with Mrs Liddell. She in turn was quickest out
of the blocks over the last 48 hours in condemning what had been
uncovered by Professor Black.
Mr Clarke in turn failed to respond and kept his head down to the
point of hiding. One of his colleagues said last night: ''If I bump into
him, I will let him know you want an interview. Equally, if I see Lord
Lucan, I will tell him you would like a word.''
Meanwhile, Mr Major wrote ''Come on George -- come clean'' before
signing a reply yesterday to Mr George Robertson, who has demanded an
apology for a Commons attack the previous day on his approach to the
Monklands affair.
Mr Major accused Mr Robertson of ''consistently withholding'' the
Labour party report on its own inquiry into Monklands.
Mr Robertson pointed out that the report was published in March 1993
and demanded an retraction.
The Prime Minister's reply stated: ''You know as well as I do that . .
. you have suppressed much of the evidence collected as part of that
inquiry.'' He added: ''It is inconceivable that your supposedly thorough
inquiry uncovered none of the evidence detailed in the report published
yesterday.
''The public deserve to be told who knew what and when, and why no
action was taken following your internal inquiry.''
Mr Robertson returned to the Commons to denounce this reply as
unsatisfactory and repeat his call for a Prime Ministerial apology.

A ROW over union representation in the largely union-free North Sea
oil industry escalated yesterday, with the TUC warning the National
Union of Mineworkers against linking up with OILC.
General secretary John Monks made it ''very clear'' to Mr Arthur
Scargill that the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee, which was set up
in direct opposition to TUC-affiliated unions, was a breakaway
organisation.
''It is not appropriate for a TUC affiliate to amalgamate with it. The
policy of the TUC is that we have nothing to do with breakaway unions,''
said Mr Monks.
Mr Ronnie McDonald, OILC general secretary, retorted that his union,
which claims some 1800 members, was hardly a breakaway because the North
Sea was virtually a no-go area as far as TUC-affiliated unions were
concerned.
If there was a breakaway union in the offshore industry it was the
AEEU which, he claimed, had broken away from the other TUC-affiliated
unions including the GMB and the MSF to sign a deal covering rig
construction and installation ''but which accepted re-recognition on
first oil flowing''.
As such they were the laughing stock of the North Sea oil employers,
said Mr McDonald, adding that his members would be balloted over the
next three to four months on becoming an oil and gas section of the NUM.
There was still a strong chance of a further link-up with the
Norwegian offshore oil industry union OFS, probably under the banner of
the Paris-based International Energy and Mineworkers Organisation
(president one Arthur Scargill) although even closer working depended on
decisions of the OFS conference due next March.
* Union membership has fallen to the lowest level for nearly 50 years
after a 5% drop last year which reduced total TUC-affiliated membership
to 6.9 million members -- the lowest figure since 1946.Membership
peaked at 12.1 million in 1980 but
the move away from traditional heavy industries, coupled with the
recent recession and a series of employment laws, has been blamed for
the decline.

A SECRET list of 20 ways to sicken the Government has been drawn up by
family doctors' leaders in preparation for a ballot on sanctions over
their out-of-hours work dispute.
A British Medical Association GPs' conference in London voted
overwhelmingly yesterday to go ahead with the ballot, following
rejection of the Government's offer earlier this month.
Talks between GP representatives and the Government broke down earlier
this week, and Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the General Medical Services
Committee, received a two-minute standing ovation from the conference
when he accused ministers of ''cynicism'' and treating doctors in a
''demeaning way.''
''We have had two years of talks and our patience has been strained to
the limit,'' he warned.Among the sanctions being considered, it is
expected that GPs could decide to start prescribing expensive drugs for
patients rather than cheaper generic brands. Such a decision would hit
the massive NHS drugs budget and could seriously upset Health Ministers'
plans for big savings.
The row has been brewing since the new GP contract in 1990 altered the
way doctors were paid for night calls, which have more than doubled over
the past five years. Some now work 100 hours a week, it is claimed.
Dr Bogle told doctors he wanted to see the Prime Minister or Health
Secretary about the issue, and a ballot will be taken soon if there is
no progress. Sanctions could begin in the autumn.
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley defended the Government's offer to
the doctors, saying GPs would receive an extra #800 a year for making,
on average, six night visits a month. She described the sum as ''pretty
significant''.
Dr Bogle complained that Health Minister Gerald Malone, who has been
conducting the talks for the Government, ''has portrayed it as
guns-to-the-head stuff. But the fact is we tried to spell out clearly
what the profession wanted.
''At no stage was he or the Government threatened and at no stage did
we discuss sanctions at all either in correspondence or our meetings
with him.''

SHELL UK last night apologised to the Prime Minister for its abrupt
decision to scrap plans to sink the redundant Brent Spar oil
installation at sea.
Mr Major was said to have described the U-turn as ''unbelievable'' and
to have accused Shell's company executives of behaving like ''wimps''.
The apology came as Energy Minister Tim Eggar, who admitted that
Shell's actions had embarrassed Ministers, warned the oil company it
could expect no favours from the Government, and that taxpayers would
not contribute to the huge cost of dismantling the Spar, estimated at
around #45m.
He also threatened to block the necessary licence for the break-up of
the vast installation on British soil, reflecting his anger that Shell
had abandoned what it had claimed was the best practicable environmental
option in favour of an apparently more popular one.
Shell's senior executive, Mr John Jennings, wrote to Mr Major
expressing regret at ''the position in which the outcome of this complex
issue placed you and your Ministerial colleagues''.
In Brussels, the European Commission said it planned to press for an
outright ban on deep water dumping.
Shell must now find an acceptable solution to the disposal of the
Brent Spar. The company yesterday admitted it still believed the deep
sea option was the best method, and that once the hysteria passed and
members of the public considered the alternatives, they would realise
there were fewer risks attached to deep sea disposal than breaking it up
on land.
Unions called for it to be broken up in Britain.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Scottish negotiator for the engineering union
AEEU, said that now it had been established the Brent Spar ''will not be
sunk in the middle of the Atlantic it is essential that the Government
ensures that British yards should be given the contract for
decommissioning. Thousands of jobs are at stake and it would be a
massive boost to the British economy.''
In his letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Jennings, chairman of Shell
Transport and Trading Company, said the Norwegian Government had offered
to moor the platform in a deep-water fjord over the winter. No
anchorages around the coast of Britain are thought to be suitable.
Meanwhile, fears remain that while an alternative plan for its
disposal is being considered, the Spar's damaged tanks could rupture and
contaminate the marine environment. Should this happen near the shore,
the potential damage could be considerably greater than deep in the
North Atlantic.
Shell has estimated that the cost of breaking it up on land could be
up to four times the estimated #10m price of sinking it at sea.
Under Inland Revenue rules the company can offset up to 55% of the
cost against Petroleum Revenue Tax and Corporation Tax. If other oil
companies now feel they have no alternative but to opt for on-shore
decommissioning for rigs and platforms that become redundant, the loss
to the Treasury could be considerable.
In the case of the Brent Spar, Mr Eggar said Shell would have to pick
up the bill for the whole extra cost of land disposal.
''I have written today to Shell to say to them that in view of the
fact that they recognise that deep sea disposal is still the best
environmental option, I see no reason at all why the British taxpayer
should pick up any of the bill over and above what deep sea disposal
would have cost,'' said Mr Eggar.
''I have not yet heard back from Shell, but I would be amazed if they
do not accept the logic of that argument.''
Mr Eggar said there were ''all sorts of problems'' with on-shore
disposal and the Government would expect an explanation as to why it was
suddenly deemed more appropriate.
''Shell are going to have to convince us that they have a better
option than deep sea disposal. I am certainly going to insist that their
case is a persuasive one,'' he said.
Labour's City spokesman, Mr Alastair Darling, said he was writing to
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke about Mr Eggar's remarks that Shell would have
to pay the extra cost of land disposal.
''It seems to me the Government is acting in a fit of pique because
they were humiliated by Shell's about-turn. It is simply not true that
there would not be taxpayers' money available,'' he said.
The Labour MP for the Western Isles, Mr Calum MacDonald, said he had
tabled questions to Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind asking whether
military personnel who arrived at Stornoway airport on Tuesday were
indeed members of the Special Boat Squadron on standby to clear the
Greenpeace protesters from the Brent Spar.
According to other reports, however, a helicopter was ready to fly out
security men to remove the four Greenpeace protesters from the Spar.
Exhausted but triumphant Greenpeace campaigners arrived back in the
Western Isles yesterday and warned that their fight over dumping had
only just begun.
Greenpeace campaigner Rose Young praised Shell for its ''difficult
decision'' to defy Mr Major.
''It would have been simpler for them to carry on with the dumping.
But they saw sense and did the right thing,'' she said.
Mr Jonathan Castle, the captain of one Greenpeace vessel involved in
the operation, the Altair, was last night remaining alongside the Spar
in case Shell made a further attempt to dump it.The Court of Session in
Edinburgh last week issued a warrant for his arrest for non-appearance
in court to identify the other activists involved in the original
occupation of the Brent Spar.
Mrs Young said: ''Jonathan has told us that when all this is over he
will face up to the legal implications of his actions.''
Councillor Angus Graham, vice-convener of the Western Isles Council,
presented plaques on behalf of the council to Greenpeace for its two
captains.
Meanwhile the Government pressed Ministers to publish all reports and
documents they have from Shell UK or its parent company relating to
options for the future of the Brent Spar.
The Shadow Environment Secretary, Mr Frank Dobson, has also called for
details of all Ministerial and official meetings with Shell UK over the
future of the platform and also information about any inter-departmental
discussions.
Labour is also seeking details of communications between the
Government and other foreign governments about how the disposal might be
handled.

AN #80m attempt by British Gas to repair its public image by offering
new discounts to prompt bill payers was yesterday criticised by Scottish
pressure groups as ''an opportunity missed''.
The OptionPay scheme offers #2 off quarterly charges for customers who
settle their bills within 10 days of receipt. The move comes after the
company was criticised for favouring the well-off by giving discounts
only to those who pay by direct debit.
It was felt the scheme, which British Gas predicts will be taken up by
as many as 10 million customers at a cost of #80m to the company, might
benefit pensioners and the unemployed, who prefer to settle their bills
in cash.
However, pressure groups who have campaigned vigorously in Scotland
against the burden of heating costs for the old and low paid said the
scheme was a limited gesture.
Mr Peter Hunter, research officer for the Scottish Low Pay Unit said:
''Those on low incomes who live a hand-to-mouth existence simply do not
have the cash flow to pay bills within 10 days. They are the most likely
to delay paying, while they give themselves time to save up the money.
''While we are glad British Gas has obviously listened to some of the
comments passed its way over the last few months, this is an opportunity
missed.''
Ms Ann Marno, director of Energy Action Scotland, said: ''Once again,
British Gas have discriminated in favour of those who are able to pay
rather than helping those who find it difficult to pay. Even for those
who can, in Scotland, where bills are traditionally higher, #2 a quarter
will not be nearly enough.''
Both groups expressed frustration that customers on British Gas'
DirectPay debit scheme would still receive the greatest discount among
bill payers: 6%, compared to an average 2.4% under OptionPay.
However, British Gas said its aim was simply to offer customers
alternative means of making savings by providing a choice of discount
schemes. Managing director of public gas supply Mike Alexander said:
''Monthly direct debit is the easiest and least costly way for the
company to collect payment, so it is only fair that the biggest savings
go to people on DirectPay.''
The company's troubles come at a time when it is preparing to compete
with private firms, which will be allowed to enter the domestic fuel
market next year in some areas of the UK and nationally in 1998.
Industry regulator, the Office of Gas Supply (OFGAS), which cleared
British Gas of discrimination over the DirectPay scheme last month,
announced an inquiry into the new price structures.
Director general Claire Spottiswoode said: ''I am particularly
concerned to ensure that these latest charges are fair and reflect the
costs of supplying gas to different groups of people.
''While I welcome discounts in principle, I will need to be convinced
that other customers will not end up footing the bill.''

AN Aberdeen teenager, who was just 13 months old when her mother was
killed in a road crash, is fighting a landmark battle for compensation
in London's High Court.
Miss Samantha Lewis, now 18, was a passenger in the car driven by her
father when it collided head-on with another in South Benfleet, Essex,
on October 31, 1977, Mr Justice Sedley was told.
Her mother, Jane, who was five months pregnant and 21 at the time,
died of her multiple injuries the same day.
Now, in a case made unique by the passage of more than 17 years, Miss
Lewis is battling for damages for the loss of the love and care of a
mother she was too young to remember.
She is suing the other motorist involved, whose insurers have accepted
75% liability on his behalf, her counsel, Miss Jacqueline Perry, told
the court yesterday.
Mrs Jane Lewis was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash
and the court heard it is accepted that she was herself 25% responsible.
Miss Perry told the court that Miss Lewis had, from soon after the
crash until her 18th birthday, been in the care of Essex County Council.
The council had placed her with various foster parents but, from the
age of about seven, her aunt, Mrs Heather Charlesworth, 42, of Henderson
Drive, Westhill, Aberdeen, had selflessly stepped in to fill the breach.
The hearing is expected to conclude today.

ONE in three teenagers over the age of 16 in Glasgow claims to take
drugs, while two-thirds drink alcohol, according to a survey published
yesterday by Greater Glasgow Health Board.
A random sample of 1100 16 to19-year-olds was interviewed for the
survey, which showed drug and alcohol use more marked among males than
females, said Dr Carol Tannahill, the board's head of health promotion.
She said 20% of males and 13% of females in the sample were drinking
more than the recommended sensible weekly levels, and overall 33% got
drunk at least once a week.
''We also need to give urgent recognition to the fact that young
people are using fortified tonic wines such as Buckfast and that the new
designer fruit wines have a high alcohol intake.
''Most young people do not understand the potential harm these drinks
may cause.''
The survey showed that young people knew a lot about drugs and
perceived them as much more dangerous than alcohol -- even those who
used them.
''The single biggest fears about taking drugs are the fear of dying
and the fear of getting hooked on drugs.
''However they expected their use to decline, indicating the
expectation of a phase in life when drugs are taken.''
Mr Frank Pignatelli, Strathclyde region's director of education, said
the figures did not surprise him.
He said continual efforts were being made, with support from health
and police, through the region's health education and drugwise
programmes, to make youngsters more aware of the dangers of using drugs.
''We want to encourage them to choose a healthy lifestyle,'' he said.
''With that, clearly there is no place for controlled drugs. Obviously
we would also want to instil a responsible attitude towards alchohol use
and not abuse.''
Mrs Maxie Richards, who has worked with drug abuse victims in Glasgow
for nine years, said last night she was astonished that the survey
claimed only one in three teenagers took drugs.
''I would say it is more like two out of every three. Most of the
people that I come across prefer drugs to alcohol,'' she said.
Mrs Richards, who set up the Maxie Richards Foundation which provides
a system of care to get addicts off drugs, added: ''One of the main
problems is that our youngsters are told that cannabis is socially
acceptable and that it won't harm them when in fact the opposite is
true.
''It is rather like 40 years ago when everyone was telling my
generation that it was all right to smoke. It has been proved beyond
doubt that you get cancer of the lungs much more quickly from smoking
cannabis than you do from smoking cigarettes.''
Mrs Richards, a leading campaigner against the use of methadone in the
treatment of heroin addiction, added: ''The adults of today are a very
selfish generation. They are enjoying what they do but they don't pay
enough attention to the health, welfare, and protection of our
children.''
* NONE of the prisoners at Cornton Vale has been found HIV positive in
Europe's firsttests for HIV infection in a women's prison.
The result was announced yesterday as details of the tests, which saw
135 women -- 94% of the Stirling prison's total at the time --
volunteer, were revealed. It was also reported that six inmates at Perth
Prison had been tested positive.
The Scottish Prison Service was praised for facing up to the problem
of HIV in the prison population with the initiative on voluntary saliva
testing for prisoners by Dr Sheila Gore of the Medical Research Council
Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge, the independent medical team involved
in the programme.
Two women known to be HIV positive did not take part in the Cornton
Vale tests.
* THE public is giving Strathclyde police a head start in their purge
on the region's drug culture, Operation Eagle.
In the first two weeks of the campaign, 171 people were arrested and
268 cases involving drugs reported to the procurator-fiscal, including
81 cases of supplying controlled drugs and 158 cases of possession. The
drugs seized included cannabis, amphetamine, heroin, temazepam,
morphine, and cocaine.
Detective Superintendent Kevin Orr, head of Strathclyde Police drugs
squad, yesterday said: ''These results have been achieved despite the
fact that we are still in the preliminary, education and awareness stage
of Operation Eagle. They show that we have tapped into a font of public
goodwill, a determination among ordinary people to do something about
the drug pushers.''

THE public and political furore over the threatened Fort William
sleeper service has been dumped in the lap of franchising director Roger
Salmon.
The British Railways Board yesterday postponed its decision on whether
to appeal against two court rulings reprieving the sleepers until Mr
Salmon makes up his mind on ScotRail's minimum passenger service
requirements.
He also faces an action for interim interdict tomorrow -- sought by
Highland Regional Council, and aimed at preventing him from carrying out
a consultation process until it has been informed of the criteria he is
using.
The board formally agreed that the sleeper would run until September
22, which at least removed summer-time uncertainty. However, it failed
to lift its threat of further action aimed at withdrawing the service.
Sources in Highland region predicted that a Fort William sleeper would
run after September 22.
They took heart from a reference in the board's statement to a period
of stability in which a clear basis might be established ''as to the
longer-term future of the service''.
It was the first time that the board -- under intense popular and
political pressure to retain the sleeper permanently -- had conceded
that a long-term future for the loss-making sleeper was on the agenda.
The board apparently wants Highland region to dilute its interdict
terms to allow a Fort William-London service to be run as cheaply as
possible, especially if Mr Salmon continues to refuse subsidies. The
board is believed to want changes which would allow a reduction in the
number of sleepers and alteration of the route taken.
Councillors, confident that the interdicts will stand unless an appeal
is lodged, are willing to talk.
The board postponed a decision on whether to appeal the two Court of
Session reprieves. It also postponed a decision on whether to initiate
formal closure procedures on three short stretches of track in the
Glasgow area that were the subject of the court cases.
The postponements were justified on the grounds that the board was
awaiting decisions by Mr Salmon. It will review its options after
consultations on the public service requirement (PSR) end on July 12.
In a separate campaign to ensure that the sleeper survives beyond
privatisation, the council will tomorrow seek an interim interdict
preventing Mr Salmon from carrying on with the consultation process
until informed of the criteria used to evaluate the benefits of
maintaining loss-making services in the Highlands.
Mr Salmon's draft PSR for ScotRail has excluded the sleeper from
services to be subsidised.
ScotRail warned that services would be cut elsewhere if it was obliged
to run the sleeper without grants.
However, it was confirmed last night that the British Railways Board
would be picking up the losses, put at #2.5m a year -- and would
continue to do so up to September 22.
Bookings are now being accepted for the sleeper, although the board
insists that it could still have reason to appeal even if Mr Salmon
returns the sleepers to the PSR.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Lib-Dem MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye, said: ''I
detect a significant change of tone and emphasis from BR which can only
be welcome''.

A DISABLED woman and her husband who have been refused the right to
buy their specially-designed council house, claimed yesterday that they
are the victims of an abuse of the law.
Paraplegic Mrs Janette Kennedy and her husband William, claimed that
their council had installed a call system and appointed a warden
deliberately to deny them their right to buy.
Mr Peter McCann, the couple's solicitor, said yesterday that he was
now giving serious consideration to taking the case further, perhaps to
Europe.
Mr Kennedy, 51, said that, when the case was heard earlier by the
Lands Tribunal for Scotland, a council official had admitted that the
call and warden system was being installed to bar tenants from buying
the houses.
Mrs Kennedy, 47, and her husband were the first tenants of the
bungalow in Margaretvale Drive, Larkhall.
It was one of four homes built in 1984 for paraplegics who were not
living alone, but with someone who could provide care and support.
Last year, the Kennedys applied to buy their home under the Housing
(Scotland) Act 1987, but the lands tribunal ruled that the house was
exempt from the right to buy given to tenants under the Act.
The couple appealed to Lords McCluskey, Milligan, and Caplan in the
Court of Session.
The judges were told that a tenant's right to buy did not apply to a
house which was one of a group which had been provided with special
facilities for pensioners or the disabled.
Mr and Mrs Kennedy argued that, when the Act came into force, their
home did not have a call system or warden, and was therefore available
for them to buy.
A call system was installed by Hamilton District Council in 1988 and
the Kennedy's claimed that this was in response to a lands tribunal
judgment which ruled that a call system and warden service were
essential before a house could be exempt under the Act.
The couple said they had been given no notice that the call system was
to be installed, nor had they agreed to it. They argued that their right
to buy the house could not be defeated by the unilateral actings of the
council.
The district council said that the real issue in the case was whether
at the time the couple applied to buy the house, it was exempt under the
1987 Act.
The council argued that the crucial date was the date of the
application to buy, not the coming into effect of the 1987 Act.
The judges agreed that the council had not acted beyond its powers and
that the Kennedy's appeal must fail.

<HEADLINE>Six life sentences for flame-thrower attack on pupils</HEADLINE>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>977764604</RECORDNO>

A MAN who launched a flame-thrower attack on children in school as
they sat exams was given six life sentences yesterday.
Garnet Bell, 46, was sentenced to three life terms for attempted
murder and three for inflicting grievous bodily harm in the attack at
Sullivan Upper school, in Holywood, County Down, Northern Ireland, last
June.
At Antrim Crown Court, he was also given seven years each for arson at
the school and at his brother's home a few miles away. All the sentences
were concurrent.
Northern Ireland Lord Chief Justice, Sir Brian Hutton, told him: ''You
aimed a flame-thrower at close range at three young men and you engulfed
them in a powerful jet of flame.
''You inflicted burns of the utmost severity and caused excruciating
pain. The crimes you committed are very wicked.''
The trial heard that Bell, an unemployed electronics expert, sometime
stuntman, and Sussex University dropout, bore a grudge against the
school he had left nearly 30 years before.
The three boys he was charged with attempting to murder were very
badly burned. Their clothes were set on fire and their skin was
blackened and falling off.
Bell turned the flame-thrower on a second row of youngsters but the
nozzle fell off, dousing the flames.
The judge said he was satisfied Bell harboured severe resentment and
grievances against people which could turn into murderous intent.
He said the great risk to the public was that not only did Bell bear
grudges but that he attempted to murder those he held grudges against.
The judge said he had a duty to punish evil and protect the public.
Among pleas of mitigation by the defence, there had been evidence from
psychiatrist Dr Brian Fleming.
He said he was satisfied Bell did not suffer from any mental illness
but did have an untreatable personality disorder.
The court heard that Bell had received a six months suspended sentence
at Brighton magistrates court in 1974 for possession of a home-made
firearm and ammunition and had been fined in Northern Ireland in 1989
for possession of a Samurai sword after a dispute with a neighbour.
The schoolboys involved were Darren Crawford, Adam Aston, and Stephen
Crossland, all 18.
Last June, while 31 pupils were sitting A-level exams in the assembly
hall at Sullivan Upper, Bell walked in and directed a flame-thrower -- a
converted fire extinguisher fuelled with a mixture of petrol and
paraffin -- at the students.
He admitted during evidence that he had carried out the attack, but
insisted he had not intended to murder anyone.
Darren Crawford and Stephen Crossland were in court to hear sentence
passed.
Darren said: ''I am satisfied.''
Stephen said: ''I want him to spend his life behind bars''.
Darren's father, Alex, said: ''I totally hate him, everything about
him, I hate him.''
Mrs Fiona Crawford said she agreed with the judge that Bell was
wicked.
She said the family felt great relief at the end of the trial and the
sentence, adding that ''it has always been at the back of your mind that
this man may get off and be free, perhaps, to do something like this
again.''

SHAKEN British holidaymakers returning from Tenerife last night
described how their aircraft was forced to plunge 20,000ft after
developing a cabin pressure fault.
The 394 passengers and 14 crew were given oxygen masks as the
Caledonian Airways Tristar jet, bound for Manchester on Tuesday night,
was forced to descend from 30,000ft.
The flight was diverted to Faro in Portugal, from where the passengers
were yesterday flown to Manchester Airport to be reunited with their
anxious relatives.
Honeymooners Stuart and Debbie Walker, from Bolton, Lancashire,
described their ordeal. Mr Walker, 26, said: ''I just heard a bang and
then a massive gush of air came through the cabin. The most frightening
time was as the plane plunged. It happened so quickly it was
bewildering.''
His 22-year-old wife added: ''There was what sounded like a recorded
announcement telling us not to panic. A voice over the intercom said
there had been a loss of air pressure.
Mr Walker said: ''I was apprehensive coming back to England by air
after that ordeal but they gave us free drinks to give us courage.''
There was widespread praise for the captain and his crew.
Mr Dave Welbourne, from Widnes, Cheshire, said: ''The crew were
superb. They were so calm but it was the most nerve-racking experience
of my life.'' His wife Haley, sobbing with relief, said: ''I'm just glad
to be home. I'm not sure if I want to fly ever again.''
Manchester Evening News sports journalist Mr Peter Gardner was also on
board with his wife Barbara.
''We were about an hour into the flight when the pressure dropped and
the plane seemed to go into freefall,'' he said. ''But there was no
panic and no injuries. Fortunately most people were wearing seat belts.
''The captain told us he was jettisoning fuel and we would be landing
at Faro under emergency conditions. All the passengers had to sit in the
bracing position but nobody panicked.''
Caledonian Airways has sent a team of engineers to Faro to examine the
Tristar and refused to speculate on the cause of the incident until
there had been a full investigation.

LORD Hugh Douglas-Hamilton, brother of Scotland's premier peer, the
Duke of Hamilton and of Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, died early yesterday from a suspected heart attack.
His wife, Sheilagh, was present when he collapsed after getting up
around 3am to go to the bathroom.
An ambulance crew and a local doctor were called to their home at
Begbie Farmhouse, Haddington, East Lothian, but efforts to revive him
failed.
The death of Lord Hugh, 48, is the latest in a series of misfortunes
which have dogged the descendants of the 14th Duke of Hamilton and
Brandon (family motto: Never Behind).
Three of the 14th duke's five sons, Hugh, Patrick, and Angus, who
succeeded to the title as 15th duke in 1973, have had much publicised
drink-driving convictions in recent years, when courts have also been
told of a series of family break-ups.
The youngest is David. James is the best known, as the Minister. Last
year, he renounced his claim to the title of Earl of Selkirk to remain
as MP for Edinburgh West but he is currently involved on behalf of his
son in a tussle with his cousin, Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, over the
inheritance.
Lord Hugh had suffered from a depressive illness for many years and,
in February 1993, was fined #400 and banned for 18 months for driving
with more than twice the legal limit of alcohol. He had been on his way
to Herdmanflatt Hospital for urgent treatment.
His personal life was at times headline grabbing. In 1971, he shocked
his Presbyterian family by converting to Roman Catholicism in order to
marry his first wife, June, a barmaid.
That marriage over, in 1990 he announced his intention to marry an
Anglican divorcee, Ms Heather Smith, then 37. At the last minute, the
wedding was called off because of ''technical religious difficulties''.
Ms Smith said Lord Hugh had been unable to get a dispensation from the
Roman Catholic Church; Lord Hugh later said he had been jilted.
Two years later, he announced plans to wed an Edinburgh journalist, Ms
Penny Haywood, then 45, after meeting her at a party. Again, that
marriage was called off.
Finally, in May last year, he married in secret Sheilagh Ellis, a
Presbyterian, in the crypt of Westminster Cathedral in front of four
guests. Lady Sheilagh, a textile sales representative, was back at work
two days later.
Lord Hugh demonstrated a willing capacity to help others. For some
time, he cut an unlikely figure as the only Etonian aristocrat among the
volunteers serving up at an Edinburgh soup kitchen for homeless people.
In 1993, he took over as honorary secretary for the Jericho House
appeal for day-care facilities for the homeless. It is now within a
whisker of reaching its #100,000 target.
Last night, the project administrator, Mr Alan McHattie, said: ''He
did a lot of good work for us and only a few days ago was sending out
letters on behalf of the appeal.''
In another incident, Lord Hugh caught a thief and made a citizen's
arrest while a psychiatric patient in the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. The
thief, Alexander McKillop, had been befriended by Lord Hugh in hospital
after he had asked the aristocrat for a couple of fivers.
In the early 1980s, Lord Hugh took great interest in Tory Island off
the Donegal coast and by organising exhibitions of the Tory Island
School of Painters in Edinburgh and elsewhere in Scotland was
instrumental in saving the island from evacuation.
Lord Hugh came from one of Scotland's illustrious families. The
Douglas-Hamiltons have held their title since 1643 and maintain links
with the royal family. Lord Hugh's brother, Lord Patrick, holds the
title of Hereditary Keeper of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the Queen's
residence in Scotland.
The family were immortalised in history books after one of the more
bizarre incidents of the Second World War, when Hitler's deputy, Rudolf
Hess, parachuted into a field close to the estate of the
Douglas-Hamiltons estate in East Lothian.
Hess was on a mission to meet Lord James's father, himself a
distinguished pilot, in the mistaken belief that, with his help, a peace
settlement between the Allies and Germany could be negotiated.
Thirty years after the event, Lord James described the ill-fated
flight in a book, Motive for a Mission: The Story Behind Hess's Flight
to Britain.
Paying tribute to his younger brother, Lord James said yesterday:
''Hugh had a great appreciation and love of all things to do with
Scotland. He was a larger-than-life figure and will be greatly missed by
his family and friends.''
Lord Hugh is survived by his son Brendan and daughter Kitty from his
first marriage to June Curtis in 1971.
Police said a post-mortem examination would be held but there were no
suspicious circumstances and a report would go to the fiscal.

TWO actors are to portray a gay couple in a British television
commercial for the first time, according to a trade magazine. The men
will be in a controversial new Guinness advertisement next month, says
Marketing.
The magazine says that viewers will see what appears to be a
heterosexual couple having a row. But at the end of the commercial the
couple are revealed as men. Bosses of the Irish drinks giant are
debating whether to show the couple kissing, says Marketing.
The commercial features a new Guinness tagline -- ''Life isn't always
black and white'' -- and uses the Tammy Wynette country hit, Stand By
Your Man, as its soundtrack, adds the magazine.
Its aim is to re-establish Guinness as a ''style-leader'' after the
departure of cult actor Rutger Hauer from the company's commercials
earlier this year, says the report.
Guinness refused to confirm or deny the report. A spokesman would say
only that a new commercial was due out in July.
Marketing quotes an unnamed Guinness source as saying: ''It's either
brave and exciting or an enormous mistake. I can't believe Guinness's
Irish owners have allowed it.''
Ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather is said to be working on more than one
possible ending which could feature a kiss or maybe just fade out.
Campaigner Mrs Mary Whitehouse, of the National Viewers' and
Listeners' Association, said yesterday: ''I think this kind of thing is
highly irresponsible.
''Without wanting to criticise individual gay people, the normalising
of gay behaviour is very anti-social and particularly unhelpful to the
young growing up and to adolescent youth.
''I would have hoped that Guinness shareholders would take up this
matter and make their voices heard.''
Gay rights groups welcomed the move as recognition of the power of the
Pink Pound, the spending power of the gay community. A spokeswoman for
one of the groups, Stonewall, said: ''We welcome this recognition that a
gay partnership can be as loving, loyal and stable as any heterosexual
one.''
