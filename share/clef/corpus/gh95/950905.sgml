<HEADLINE>Japanese attracted by bargain prices. Visitors work on golf's etiquette</HEADLINE>

THE story has reached us from Australia where a group of Japanese
golfers, well accustomed to paying astronomical green fees, purchased
tickets to play a public course. ''That will be four-fifty each,'' said
the official, who then had to explain, presumably reluctantly as the
visitors happily began to unfold $100 bills, that he meant $4.50 and not
$450.
Golf club memberships in Japan, albeit saleable shares, currently cost
the equivalent of tens of thousands of pounds. On top of that each round
can cost up to #200, so a growing number of Japanese nationals, not far
short of a thousand, currently resident in Scotland are finding
themselves looking at a golfing Pandora's box.
Of this number around 200 are keen golfers, almost half of them having
taken up club memberships at what they consider to be bargain-basement
prices.
This integration with the Scottish club golf culture has not been
without its teething troubles. Already they have been strongly advised
to curb their natural, excitable instincts and observe the ancient
traditions of the game.
The advice was courtesy of Yoshikazu Kaneko, the soon-to-depart consul
general of Japan in Scotland, who, at a function at his Edinburgh
residence this year, drew attention to a point of frequently breached
etiquette, the matter of moving and talking when someone else is
playing.
''I told them that they should behave themselves on Scottish courses
and that they should not jump up and down and make a lot of noise when a
putt is holed or someone has hit an important shot into the rough,''
said Scotland's most senior Japanese.
''It is normal for them to act in this way and they do it all the time
in Japan. There, it is not so bad because tees and greens tend to be
further apart than in Scotland. Here, they are liable to forget that
they might be disturbing the concentration of others.''
The 15-handicapper, who has feasted himself by joining Murrayfield,
Dalmahoy, and Gleneagles, has to make an effort at times to remember his
own counsel. He, himself, is partial to a touch of national fervour --
like when he parred four holes in a row at Helensburgh to put his side
in front during an informal Scotland v Japan four-ball, partnered by
Satoshi Itoh, director and production adviser of Larkhall-based Daks
Simpson, a member at Hamilton and Westerwood, and an Isao Aoki
lookalike. Talking while putting, though, was restricted to his own
strokes, a method which worked regularly for the nasty six-footers, as
in: ''Back and straight through to the hole. It's easy . . . Yes!''
A measure of the importance he attaches to correct golfing behaviour
is that it came in almost, but not quite, the same breath as his
reminder that this year is the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the
war. ''We must be aware of the past but we must also look to the
future,'' said Kaneko san, who was only seven years old on VJ Day. (San,
incidentally, is roughly equivalent to the British Mr or Mrs, and its
use is proper even on sports pages, where such formalities are normally
abandoned).
The future seems to be taking care of itself in Scotland, where 36
Japanese companies are now manufacturing -- hence the increasing number
of Japanese golfers -- a development which has also led to the rising
status of his own office, which he vacates next month, grateful for the
welcome he and his wife have received here. He will return to Japan
briefly before leaving again for a destination as yet unknown.
He agrees that golf in Scotland is a paradise which helps ease the
traumas of Japanese setting up home in a foreign land. In Japan, there
are around 3000 golf courses, seven times as many as in Scotland, but
with a population of 120 million compared to our five million, it works
out that we have more than three times as many per head.
The cost of golf is vastly different. The consul general paid the
equivalent of #500 in the 1960s for one of two membership shares which
he still holds in Japan. He reckons it is now worth #35,000.
It is hardly surprising then that more than half of the Japanese, more
familiar with driving-range golf, have taken up the club game since
arriving in Scotland, the downside being lengthy waiting lists. In
Japan, if you can afford it, access tends to be immediate.
Itoh san, or ''Bing'' as he is commonly known, is secretary of the
newly formed Japan Golf in Scotland Society, which is to hold its first
championship at Murrayshall in October. The 18-handicapper is still
trying to post the monthly qualifying score in the low 80s which will
allow him to compete in the 15-strong field as well as officiate.
There has also been an annual match between Japan and a team put
together by Locate in Scotland, with the series currently standing at
2-1 to Scotland.
Our informal match (which is quite unnecessary to report as a narrow
win for Scotland), was followed by a spot of unusual apres-golf at the
town's Golden River Chinese restaurant, where further advice was
delivered on the etiquette of eastern cuisine, and a lesson on the
technique of chopsticks.
Rest one on the thumb and place the other between the second and third
fingers, gripping well up the shaft. Having thought about it hard, I
cannot see any application whatsoever for this skill in the golf swing.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth is being asked to explain why the
headquarters of the new Children's Reporter Administration is to be
located in Stirling when more than half the cases originate in
Strathclyde.
The challenge comes in a letter to Mr Forsyth from senior Strathclyde
councillor Mr Des McNulty, who headed the region's campaign against
local government reorganisation.
He points out that half the 556 staff in the Children's Reporter
service are based in Strathclyde and more than half the 40,500 child
referrals originate in Strathclyde.
Councillor McNulty said: ''We think, therefore, there's a very strong,
logical case for it being either in Strathclyde or possibly in Edinburgh
-- within proximity to the majority of clients, or proximity of the law
courts. But it is actually being pushed to Stirling, where it's nearer
neither.
''It just means an extra burden of travelling for those people who
have to go to the centre. It also means about 70 jobs being taken away
from other areas.''
However, Mr Alan Miller, principal reporter of the Children's Reporter
Administration, explained that the decision to locate in Stirling was
based almost exclusively on operational criteria related to the
availability of good quality, value for money, accommodation, with good
transport links, good environment, and in a setting that would meet the
needs and aspirations of staff within the service.

THE need for re-adjustment in the Scottish rules to allow clubs to
sign foreign players was evident from the men's games in the City of
Glasgow Integrated Tournament at the Kelvin Hall, which went some way to
achieving its object of raising the profile of the sport in the city.
But the final between Birmingham Bullets and London Leopards, though
competitive, was no more than an exhibition match and as such was
scarcely likely to excite the home spectators.
Earlier, Scottish teams Glasgow Brightsiders and Livingston Bulls had
been swept aside by the the visitors, including Irish side Killester,
who all had their quotas of two American pros.
Brightsiders, who jokingly refer to being sponsored by the St Andrew's
Ambulance Association, were again in the wars. Already without probably
their best player Alan Kiddie, who has back trouble, they lost their two
best guards Tony McDaid, with a broken nose, and Robert McKechnie with
concussion -- all this in a supposedly non-contact sport.
Brightsiders are due to take part in the British men's club
championship in Belfast this weekend. Four Irish teams and Cardiff make
up the BIBF-event line-up. With the others having foreign players,
Brightsiders will again be handicapped.
The playing fields are more level in the women's game, and the BIBF
Championship which was incorporated in the Glasgow tournament was close
and competitive, Sheffield Hatters the winners over Rhondda from Wales.
While Brightsiders are in Belfast, the annual meeting of the SBA in
Edinburgh is due to approve the new development plan for the sport
called ''Turn Up the Volume'.' It will need the help of many more
volunteers if it is to succeed. The meeting is being switched from its
traditional Meadowbank venue to the Stakis Airport Hotel.

MELANIE Neef, the Europa Cup 400 metres champion, has decided to end
her season, turning down invitations to race in Rieti tonight and South
Africa later this month.
The City of Glasgow woman, after the best season of her career -- but
a tantalising two hundredths short of the 15-year-old Scottish record --
confirmed yesterday that she is taking a month's rest before preparing
for next year's European indoor championship campaign and the Olympics.
Her coach, Bob Inglis, believes that more time spent concentrating on
200m is the key to being competitive at the longer distance.
Escalating costs may make this the last meeting at Rieti, where, 12
years ago yesterday, Steve Ovett set a world 1500m record of 3-30.77 and
Maricica Puica broke the women's mile record (4-17.44) in 1982.
Noureddine Morceli, already an honourary citzen of the Italian town,
having established world records there in 1992 (1500) and '93 (mile),
has promised to attack his own 3000m world best of 7-25.11, and Sonia
O'Sullivan will try for the women's mile mark.
Britain's triple jump world record-holder, Jonathan Edwards, world
pole vault champion Sergei Bubka, steeplechase champion Moses Kiptanui,
double champion Michael Johnson, and former champion Linford Christie
are all confirmed starters.
Neef yesterday helped launch a new sports award, the Scottish Friendly
Sports Bursary.
A total of #3000 is available to young Scots who have shown dedication
and commitment to their chosen sport. The top award is #1000.

SCOTTISH men's champions City of Glasgow Ragazzi have lost three of
their title-winning squad from last season. Ian McKenzie, Imonerfe
Bowes, and Archie McGougan -- all Scottish international players -- will
be absent for the new campaign which starts later this month.
McKenzie has retired from the game due to family commitments, Bowes
has joined the Great Britain volleyball training programme in Sheffield,
and McGougan has moved to Aberdeen to study.
''We've lost two of our starting six and one who was potentially
starting six for the new season. Life's real tough,'' said Ragazzi coach
Tommy Dowens. ''A lot of teams will now think they can have a shot at
us, but they will still need to be very good to beat us.''

BRITAIN'S most powerful racehorse owner, Sheikh Mohammed, has a major
hand to play in Saturday's Pertemps St Leger.
Six of the 15 horses declared at the five-day stage run in the
maroon-and-white colours of the Sheikh -- but as few as two may actually
run.
Anthony Stroud, the Sheikh's racing manager, said that the Michael
Stoute-trained In Camera is the only definite runner out of the six,
although he is likely to be joined by Kalabo from Henry Cecil's yard if
the ground is good.
If the weather turns nasty then the duo could be joined by the Andre
Fabre-trained Affidavit.
Sheikh Mohammed is also represented by Luso, who runs in the colours
of Saeed Manana, and Classic Cliche, while Swain is most unlikely to
run.
''We haven't made up our minds over Jural -- there are stamina
doubts,'' said Stroud.
Despite this news, the odds against Jural have been cut in most lists.
Ladbrokes, who have a ''non-runner, no bet'' rule for the race, have cut
the odds about the Mark Johnston-trained filly to 12-1 from 16s.
Vodafone Derby third Presenting still heads the market in all lists,
although doubts about the ground -- advance going is good to firm, good
in places -- have caused the favourite to drift from 6-4 to 7-4 with
Ladbrokes.

ICE HOCKEY
AN investigation was launched last night into crowd trouble in which
two top Scots players had their helmets ripped off by angry fans. Jason
Stewart and Dean Smith were grabbed near the boards during the early
stages of Paisley Pirates' Division One match with Solihull Barons in
the Midlands.
David Frame, chief executive of the British Ice Hockey Association,
said: ''The referee's report will be passed to the chairman of the
BIHA's disciplinary committee and he will take the appropriate action.''
He added: ''I will also be talking to the chairman of the English
referees panel about the incident.''
Pirates' coach Martin Shields, said: ''We're lodging an official
protest. This sort of thing has no place in ice hockey.'' He added:
''That was the nearest thing to a riot I've ever seen at an ice rink.''
Stewards moved in to calm the crowd at the Hobs Moat Road rink on
Sunday, and match referee Jamie Crapper held the game up for around 10
minutes.
Pirates went on to win the penalty-filled game 20-6.

FRANK Bruno beat Oliver McCall on that famous and historic night for
British sport at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. That was a straightforward
and memorable fact.
On the morning after, everything still seemed logical -- Bruno to
fight Mike Tyson in a #60m bonanza next year.
Promoter Don King did not even bring Bruno's British rival, Lennox
Lewis, into the equation. But what a difference a day can make.
Bruno is WBC heavyweight champion, and Lennox is not -- but Lewis's
handlers now insist they will still be significant power players during
the next year's world title political in-fighting.
Lewis's promoter, Panos Eliades, contended yesterday that Bruno-Tyson
cannot take place without him giving the nod, because of a ruling given
by the World Boxing Council at last November's annual congress in
Seville.
It pledged a WBC title fight to their former champion Lewis, provided
he beat Lionel Butler in a May final eliminator in Sacramento.
Lewis obliged by stopping Butler and everything seemed as crystal
clear as it ever can be in the high-powered league of heavyweight
boxing.
However, the WBC's decision prematurely topromote Tyson to the No.1
slot has complicated the situation, as the leading contender retains the
right meet the champion.
It would all now appear to be a somewhat confused picture facing Bruno
as the new title-holder and the championship scenario will unfold over
the coming months.
Eliades is convinced that Tyson will first meet WBA holder Bruce
Seldon and then the winner of the December 9 vacant IBF clash between
Germany's Axel Schulz and South African Frans Botha -- then Tyson will
turn his attentions towards the WBC crown.
All that would leave Lewis in limbo for the best part of 1996 and the
Lewis team do not intend to stand for it.
''Lewis was granted the fight against McCall or Bruno after winning in
Sacramento,'' said Eliades. ''Three weeks ago it was confirmed again by
WBC president Jose Sulaiman, and again a week later. I've been
guaranteed the winner. If we don't get him, we have a legal case.

BADMINTON
SCOTLAND failed to end a run of defeats which span more than 50 years
yesterday when they lost 5-2 to England at their annual international
clash in front of capacity crowds at Meadowbank in Edinburgh.
However, as has so often been the case on 65 other occasions, the
Scots came perilously close.
Attending the premiere of Braveheart in his home town of Stirling put
Jim Mailer in the right frame of mind to sweep to a 15-5, 14-18, 15-8
victory over Steffan Pandya.
''The film definitely inspired me to play well for Scotland against
England,'' said the 26-year-old afterwards.
Mailer, a freelance photographer, who saved Scotland's blushes last
year by putting the sole point on the board, only found out he was in
the team while he was on holiday in America.
He had to find a nearby gym to get some last-minute training under his
belt before flying home on Friday.
Kenny Middlemiss and Elinor Allen picked up another point in the mixed
doubles against Ian Pearson and Joanne Davies.
Fresh from their win at last weekend's Perth Open, the Scottish
champions had few problems on their way to a 15-11, 15-5 victory.
Craig Robertson and Alastair Gatt were 11-0 up in their second game
against Pearson and James Anderson, but failed to take advantage of
seven game-point opportunities and disappointingly lost their match
15-5, 17-16. Details:
B Flockhart lost to P Bush 15-18, 15-6, 8-15.
J Mailer beat S Pandya 15-5, 14-18, 15-8.
A Gibson lost to J Muggeridge 5-11, 5-11.
K Middlemiss and R Hogg lost to J Quinn and N Cottrill 8-15, 8-15.
A Gatt and C Robertson lost to I Pearson and J Anderson 5-15, 16-17.
E Allen and J Haldane lost to N Beck and J Davies 15-18, 7-15.
Middlemiss and Allen beat Pearson and Davies 15-11, 15-5.

FRANK Bruno, World Boxing Council champion. If Muhammad Ali were aware
of what was going on around him he would cringe in embarrassment.
The WBC crown, which has been worn in the past by Dempsey, Louis, Ali,
and Frazier, now is in the hands of a terribly nice man, but a
drastically limited fighter and while it is pleasant to see this huge
lump bask in his time of glory are we really entitled to rejoice in the
fact that what was once the richest and most prestigious prize in all of
sport's wide kingdom has become devalued?
Boxing is almost totally devoid now of integrity, a quality none of us
was ever likely to be bogged down in anywhere near a professional ring
and although ownership of a heavy-weight world title guarantees greater
fortunes than ever before, these crowns are morally bankrupt. At least
in the past there were attempts to camouflage the influence of gangsters
and hucksters, but the good and the bad these days sit side by side in
the best seats. Boxing no longer feels the need to disguise the con.
These days it pushes it with fireworks, lazer displays, and fanfares.
The bigger the lie the greater the presentation and it has come to the
point where even serious newspapers are hanging on every word spoken by
shameless mercenaries like Don King who get away with dropping into
countries around the world borrowing from local folklore to publicise
woefully inadequate products. After Bruno had taken care of Oliver
McCall, an opponent who was as agile and threatening as a fence post,
the garish King described England's hero as being like Sir Lancelot
arriving on his charger, but the most infuriating aspect of this former
jailbird is that he talks as though everyone believes him.
Of course it is enough that some listen and are taken in by the
hyperbole which surrounds boxing. In sport there is always a queue of
fools around the block waiting to be parted from their money and with
the onset of cable television as well as satellite, which offers
pay-per-view events, the wheelers and dealers have never had it so good.
They will become even wealthier through their work of degrading this
sport and if anyone is in doubt about that think back to the outlandish
presentation at Wembley on Saturday night. The show had more to do with
a Rocky movie than reality. Boxing, sadly, is almost exactly like the
make-believe, spoof world of professional wrestling, and we, the public,
the sports fans, allowed King and his kind to distort fighting to the
extent that it has become a sham.
Everything now is in the presentation, the sell to the gullible and
once the promoters have roped enough dopes, to paraphrase the real king,
Ali, a couple of hulks are pointed in the direction of a ring in which
they lumber around hamming it up like extras from one of those dreadful
old Carry On films. If enough glitz is sprinkled you have a spectacle of
some sort, but it isn't boxing as some of us remember it.
The Don Kings, who inveigle their way into sport, have taken a proud
and noble art, tarted it up in gaudy colours, dredged up some of the
worst sluggers the fight game has ever seen, and marketed them as mighty
purveyors of pain. Former title-holder Ingemar Johansson told no lies
when he described McCall's attempt to keep his title as ''the worst
performance I've ever seen from a heavy-weight champion,''
Surely we are witnessing corruption of a sport's principles on a grand
scale when a man who belongs in pantomime tights and not fights walks
away with what was once a meaningful title. It was also his fourth
attempt to win the division and although he was slightly more mobile
this time than in any of his previous statuesque performances good old
Frank remains nothing more than a decent, gregarious man trapped in a
fighter's body.
It is not his fault that back-room politics and careful manipulation
allowed him a fourth shot at the title but please, don't try to say he
is a true champion beause he beat a man who wouldn't have earned a slot
on Joe Louis's bum-of-the-month schedule. Bruno's credentials are not
those of a true champion; his handlers won him his title and they will
earn him as much as $10m when he fights Mike Tyson after the former
champion's people have finished picking the pockets of the naive.
Tyson, on the comeback trail after having been released from prison,
fought Peter McNeely a couple of weekends ago and their fight lasted 89
seconds. The former world champion received $25m.
It is a crime that these ridiculous creatures can invade our living
rooms, and I include the supporters of Bruno in this category.Their
performance at Wembley also was disgraceful. In fact, it was a night of
obscene, rampant jingoism: Bulldog Brits at their sickening best.
We can expect calls to have dear old Frank, who was made an MBE beause
he had failed to win the title, knighted now that he has become the
champ even if the reality is that he would be little more than an even
bet to win a shadow-boxing contest.
Bruno, of course, will say he is entitled to his share because if he
doesn't accept the opportunities someone else will be manufactured and
manoeuvred into a position to excite the masses until they have no more
money left to give.
By then, however, boxing as a true sport will be dead. Indeed, the
identity of the new world boxing champion suggests it may already be too
late.

I WRITE regarding your report on the open-cast proposals at Ormiston,
East Lothian, and the editorial which commented solely on perceived
negative aspects of the industry (August 15).
In general open-cast sites today produce coal far more
cost-effectively than by deep mining. This is a function of the
increased scale of plant used and the size of sites now capable of being
worked since privatisation.
The main threat to underground mining is not, however, from open-cast
but from coal supplied by overseas producers where much thicker seams
and lower extraction costs are the norm.
It is not true to say that open-cast sites always concentrate on
greenfield sites disturbing good agricultural land. In general operators
seek the sites which are more acceptable to planners and local
communities which are normally located in areas of devastated or
low-grade land. As a result sites proliferate in the area north of
Motherwell and south of Falkirk and across the country in other areas of
lower-quality land.
The benefits of open-cast mining and its links with land reclamation
have long been acknowledged by Scottish Enterprise and previously the
Scottish Development Agency who have carried out many schemes where
shallow mineworkings, often in a dangerous condition, coal spoil heaps,
and contaminated land have been reclaimed and in many instances the land
returned to beneficial use for housing development or road construction.
A major authority to benefit from open-cast reclamation has been Fife
Regional Council where the bulk of the old mineworkings formerly
underlyinh the A92 (East Fife Regional Road) have been excavated to
enable construction of this road at greatly reduced cost.
When open-cast works are proposed on land of higher quality or on
sites which are environmentally sensitive, the open-cast industry is
very much aware of the need to present itself as the good neighbour and
design of operations can take many years to formulate in consultation
with planning departments and their statutory consultees.
Accordingly many of the fears of locals which, in most instances, are
unfounded, can be ironed out before operations commence with attention
to anyareas which may be considered sensitive.
The open-cast mining fraternity are therefore not the destroyers of
agricultural land as portrayed in the report of August 15 but a
responsible industry employing many thousands of personnel both directly
and indirectly and contributing large amounts of money in rates and in
local investment.
The industry is the natural progression from deep mining to meet
national need for coals in the household and power-station markets. The
alternative fuel to meet these markets would come from abroad which a
supplier of deep-mined coal in this country would never be in a position
to compete with.

Luanda
AT least 25 people, including three Britons and five Filipinos, have
been killed in an ambush on a bus in Angola, the state news agency Angop
reported today.
It quoted government military spokesman Brigadier Jose Manuel Jota as
saying the weekend attack occurred about 11 miles from Lucapa in the
northeastern province of Lunda Norte.
Jota blamed the attack on Unita, which fought a 19-year-long civil war
against the government until a peace pact was signed last November.
No independent confirmation was available.
Jota described the ambush as a ''barbaric act'', violating the
ceasefire both sides are supposed to be observing. He said that the
attack was carried out on a road recently reopened to general traffic
after being closed during the war.
The Angop report followed a statement on state radio last Friday that
both sides had pledged to allow the free movement of people and goods
through the country, except for troops.--Reuter.

MANY thanks to Patricia Fenn for her interesting and informative
article, Paris March (August 21).
My husband and I have just returned from a short break in Paris and we
used it to explore the French capital. The details of the walks on the
Left Bank and the Right Bank gave us lots of landmarks to look out for
and tips about where to shop.
Only once were we confused. We found that with the Brasserie Les Deux
Magots and the Brasserie Lipp she didn't know her gauche from her
droite!

MUCH of the football chattering class was divided on the merits or
demerits of Ivan Golac when he was manager of Dundee United. Indeed,
when he was sacked before the end of last season, the controversy
surrounding his style of management caused many a rammy in the
public-house debating chambers of the country.
It so happens I was a fan, and not just because whenever we spoke he
proved entertaining, likeable, and intelligent. It was my view, and
remains so, that his tongue-in-cheek nonsense livened up the football
scene, which can get very introspective and ultra-sensitive when life
and times are not so good.
Golac genuinely did not understand the Calvinistic determination to
treat the old ball game with the kind of serious reverence normally
reserved for the real problems of life. For him, to threaten to beat
Rangers 4-0 was great fun, especially as this utterance drew the
anticipated outrage from the Ibrox aficionados. When they let him have
the full vent of their wrath, nothing could have tickled him more.
Golac brought a different, self-mocking sybaritic attitude to the
manager's job but at no time indicated that he enjoyed defeat any more
than the next man. Like any other manager he was liked by some players,
disliked by others, but the day a manager can claim to be unanimously
liked by his staff will usually be the day after he leaves.
There were some who argued that his league record was so poor that he
warranted the boot, and maybe they were right, despite the fact that he
had become the first leader to take United to success in the Scottish
Cup. Perhaps his transfer dealings, which unearthed some unlikely stars,
with one big exception in Gordan Petric, were less than momentous, too,
but his disappearance unquestionably reduced the colour and fun from a
sport that is not overburdened with those attractions.
All of which might indicate that for me at least Ivan, with all his
faults, was all right, yet I believe he is in danger of losing his fan
club in exile. The Croatian maybe was entitled to say a few things about
the way he felt the club had made errors of judgment, even insist that
he would have achieved the success he felt was in sight. He did so, and
fair enough, but he has said so again, and again.
It is time now to let well alone, Ivan. The image of an embittered
ex-manager sniping from his lonely den in a far country does not suit
the gregarious wise-cracking man who would steer conversations from
football to rock 'n' roll, to what he called his beloved Yugoslavia,
with fascinating mental dexterity.
Like any other sacked manager, he will believe that his treatment was
unjust, and many people here in Scotland would empathise with that view,
but there has to come a time when the past is done with and the man who
takes over should be given the freedom to do his best.
Managers know that next week, even tomorrow, the positions of the
sacked and the employed can be reversed and for that reason alone there
ought to be an unwritten agreement among them to respect each other.
Golac should let Billy Kirkwood get on with his job and concentrate on
the day when he, Golac, returns to the manager's table elsewhere.
Whenever it happens, I will be first to wish him well. Life has not
been nearly as much fun since he left.
* RACING fans, especially in Scotland, should take a note of the name,
Brumon, if only because it will be interesting to see how the horse
progresses under the eye of Invergowrie trainer Tom Dyer. Dyer had cruel
misfortune recently when his star sprinter, All Wujud, died after being
injured at York, but the horse's owner, Mike Flynn, has bought Brumon
out of David Arbuthnot's stable for 15,000 guineas in the hope of
similar success.
That is a tall order, considering that Al won three major races this
season, but the accountant/trainer from Dundee showed with that horse in
particular that he can conjure up unseen reserves from new inmates at
the picturesque and peaceful stables which are the most northerly in
Britain. He our good wishes.

SCOTLAND fans who made the assumption that the crucial European
Championship qualifying match would be screened live on television
tomorrow night could be involved in one of the most hectic ticket
scrambles of recent years.
The game is not being shown live but in highlight form by BBC, who
have the contract to transmit the international matches involving
Scotland.
Under the contract the BBC have the right to show one live home match
in the qualifying series but they used that against Russia in November.
The SFA's PR executive David Findlay put it this way: ''Our message to
supporters is don't delay, get your tickets now. We are very confident
that the match will be a total sell-out on Wednesday.''
The same situation will prevail for Scotland's final game in the
championship, against San Marino in November at Hampden.

THE South of Scotland clubs probably will veto player payments, and
have already adopted an unofficial policy to this effect in advance of a
directive from the Scottish Rugby Union.
The SRU has called a meeting of all clubs, which will be at
Murrayfield on Friday week, when the grassroots of the game will have
their first opportunity to debate the ramifications of the International
Board's announcement in Paris 10 days ago that the amateurism
regulations will be scrapped.
A second meeting has been called, involving the 16 clubs in top two
premiership divisions for the following Tuesday.
However, at a meeting in Melrose, chaired by senior SRU official
Arthur Hastie and attended also by fellow committee men Duncan Paterson,
Derek Brown and Bert Duffy, the overwhelming mood of the meeting was
that payment should be prohibited.
It was agreed that before formulating an official position, the clubs
would await a directive from Murrayfield.
Yesterday, Hawick secretary John Thorburn said: ''There is not the
money to pay players and that represents the simple mathematics of the
matter. I think you can take it that there will be no payments in the
South.''
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said yesterday that the Murrayfield
summit on Friday week would take the form of an information meeting for
the clubs, and would be addressed by SRU International Board
representative Fred McLeod.
''There is understandable concern among the clubs and this will be the
first time that they have been able to sit down en masse and consider
the implications. There will be no directive from the SRU at this stage.
The clubs will hear what Fred has to say and, maybe, they will want to
go away and think about in advance of another meeting when decisions can
be taken.
''I've no doubt that a lot of clubs are still thinking about the
matter.* GREGOR Townsend has thrown in his lot with Ian McGeechan's
Northampton, ending speculation that he would re-enlist with his
home-town club, Gala, when he returns to the UK from the Sydney club,
Warringah.
Townsend said yesterday: ''I'll be home at the end of the month and
the prospect of being coached by Geech, plus the fact that I've got
three interviews lined up in the City of London, swung the balance.''
''I'm sorry to be leaving Gala and hopefully at some point I'll be
able to come back to Scotland and play for them.''

THE two unsung heroes of Scotland's victory over Greece -- the
strikers who began the game -- are both doubtful for the clash with
Finland at Hampden tomorrow.
Duncan Shearer and Darren Jackson will face fitness tests this morning
before the national team coach, Craig Brown, decides whether they are
ready or not for this final challenge.
Suddenly, yesterday at Troon, there were worries around the Scotland
camp which had not been there before. Not that the confidence has
diminished around the squad.
Indeed, the players will watch a special showing of Mel Gibson's
''Braveheart'' to fuel any further nationalistic feeling they may need
against Finland in a game which can propel them to the European
Championship finals.
That may not be necessary, because yesterday we saw a group of
Scotland players who want desperately to be in England next summer.
There is a belief among them that they cannot afford to fail and that
this, perhaps, is their destiny.
The opportunity is there for them to be among Europe's elite and not
one of them can contemplate failure. Craig Brown insists: ''We are not
even thinking about losing this game.
''We know that statistically we can draw the game, or even lose it,
and still be able to qualify. That is not what we want. It is not what
we are thinking about.
''What we want here is a win and then we still have everything in our
own hands. If we think about a draw, then we could be in a situation
where Finland or Greece could still qualify and we don't want that.
''The important thing for us is that we go out to win the game. An
early goal would lift us and put doubts in their minds, especially after
their last match when they lost six goals to the Russians.
''That must still hang about in their memories and if we score a quick
goal then the crowd would be lifted and the players would gain
confidence.''
While Aberdeen striker Shearer and the more adaptable Jackson from
Hibs, both nurse injuries, Brown remained largely unconcerned about that
yesterday while admitting that his options had closed down.
He seemed more involved in the problems he might have had in defence
because of the broken toe which Colin Hendry has suffered playing for
Blackburn.
Hendry, though, will play. He insisted last night: ''I have played
with this injury for my club, and I will play with the injury for my
country.
''It is not going to affect me at all. I need a jab to play for
Blackburn, and I will take the same jab when I am playing here at
Hampden this week.
''It is not going to bother me. I just want to be here and to help
Scotland to qualify.''
Brown, meanwhile, stressed that he would not allow an injection to
take place without the full consent of the player and his club.
''We have a policy about that,'' he reminded everyone, ''and we don't
want to change it. I would never allow a player to take any kind of jab
unless both he and his club gave their permission.
''Colin is desperate to play and that is the type of attitude we want
from the players in this game.
''It is a problem for us that we have two strikers doubtful for the
game but, remember, we brought six front men with us. Even if both fail,
we would still have four front players who would be ready to play in
this one.
''We want them all -- but we will settle for four fully fit
strikers.''
One of those is Aberdeen's Scott Booth, and yesterday Brown was
emphasising, yet again, how much both Scotland and Aberdeen had missed
the striker's pace and finishing last season.
Said Brown: ''We had him in games when he scored goals and then he was
injured and it was a sore miss for us and his club. Now he has been
scoring for Aberdeen again and he is back with us.''
Booth, too, is happy, with his form at club level, and with his
immediate promotion to the national side. And he admits: ''I enjoy
playing at international level and this is going to be a bonus for me
coming so early. I just want to take up where I left off -- getting
goals.''
That is what Brown wants too. And what everyone at Hampden will be
willing to happen tomorrow night.
Booth could become a hero. Just like Ally McCoist. It's all there,
laid out in front of him.

SO often these days the word which recurs in accounts of hideous
atrocities or analyses of dogmatic beliefs is ''fundamentalist''.
Northern Ireland, Oklahoma, Iran, Japan, the West Bank, Algeria, and
Sudan are bedevilled by forms of ''fundamentalism'', we are told, which
countenances no peace at any price, but prefers martyrdom or suicide to
compromise or contamination of its purity.
Fundamentalism's mind-set and all it produces remain arguably the most
vicious threat to world harmony, and to individuals' happiness too, for
in the respectable guise of conservative, but extremist, Christianity it
wreaks emotional havoc upon those who are brought up within, or are
later brought into, its orb of influence.
Its strident ugliness is most noticeably heard in The Herald from John
Macleod, but others also occasionally trumpet its tenets, like Jack
Thomson in his Herald Essay some weeks back.
These people brook no contrary views to their own, for They Are Right,
They, only they, possess the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the
Truth. Their doctrinal purity is their god and no such secondary
consideration as love or tolerance has comparable weight in their
thinking.
So all the vitriolic indignation in the world against ''Macleod on
Barrymore'' will not alter his opinion or diminish his holy
determination to articulate it one whit.
Even if his extinction as a journalist followed, he would consider
that a small price, rather a glorious trophy, and a sure means of
elevation within the coming Kingdom of God.
It seems to me high time, therefore, that an accredited, scholarly
authority on the phenomenon of fundamentalism should be engaged by The
Herald to deal with it in depth and demonstrate to us why even in terms
of biblical revelation and sound exegesis, so-called Christian
fundamentalism is quite simply wrong.
This would surely be a signal service to thousands of your readers and
to the literate world at large, not to mention the countless, silent
agonisers who fear they are consigned to hopeless, eternal doom by the
effusions of Macleod and his sort.
The importance of the issue cannot be exaggerated and the need is
grave.
Meantime those tormented by the problem and its implications could
hardly do better than read the Rev Professor James Barr's pastoral
masterpiece, Escaping from Fundamentalism (SCM Press, 1984), for help
and consolation.
I have yet to see his masterly reasoning refuted by any
fundamentalist. Because he's right.

CAN I be allowed to write down a few words used to describe John
Macleod (with whom I frequently do not see eye to eye)? ''Ignorant,''
''revolting,'' ''wee,'' ''bigoted'' -- and that was only last Friday's
selection.
Why is it that when an article upsets the politically correct all hell
is let loose? It's about time we redefined ''political correctness'' to
''political cleansing''. Like ethnic cleansers they launch a genocidal
scorched-earth policy against their enemies. Only instead of wiping out
people the political cleansers target ideas and views.
They so monopolise the market-place of opinions through their
domination of the media that many of them have come to believe that
their pet theories and philosophical structures have no legitimate
intellectual competition. They just declare the other person's point of
view as no better than misguided and stupid.
When someone like John Macleod hits a raw nerve in their beliefs you
can practically see the poison coming out of their pens.
What concerns me about these enlightened thought police is that they
are forever paying lip service to the idea of free speech but are the
first ones in line to place restrictions on it for those with whom they
disagree.

Live Action
LIVE action was once the realm of Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasists who
would spend their weekends wandering round Woking woods dressed in a
cloak, clutching a sword, and searching for the lost jewel of Artar.
They were always very polite to the public, who would come across them
while walking the dog, before continuing on their quest. Today computer
technology has elevated live-action adventures to new heights, so it is
unfortunate to find Terror Under The Arches back in Woking woods.
Designed by the creator of Alien War which, since its launch at The
Arches, has spun off into a multi-million pound success based in London,
Terror applies the rule that anticipation and perspiration are the key
ingredients of horror cocktails. But it's too much anticipation for too
little a return. A monk leads parties of eight people through a haunted
crypt. Though atmospheric, his favourite quip is: ''I must go and search
on ahead . . . wait here!'' Cue rising dead and dripping walls.
A good party of Scooby Doo fans and goths will get a kick out of
frights in the dark, and there is one shocker -- a Hannibal Lecter
lookalike kitted out in mask with chainsaw. But it's a ghost train
running 20 years after they cancelled the service. Alien War has the
adrenalin of a chase, Terror is more a stroll with the occasional shock.
Kids, however, may well be more seriously surprised. Though computer
games let them rip their opponent's heart out, in The Arches their own
might just burst.

PAUL Gascoigne is ready to unveil a new look against Colombia tomorrow
-- and it won't be just the hair that may have changed.
After all his trials and tribulations, Gascoigne awaits the call to
resume his place at the heart of the England team.But he is a more
sober, single-minded playmaker.
''My ambitions now are to play well for the team and entertain the
crowd, but not with anything stupid,'' he promises. ''I just want to
show people how good I can be. I want to make my team tick.
''My match fitness is better and the magic is all coming back. But it
won't happen in the next couple of months. It will take a while, but
hopefully not too long. It will come.''
Colombia play a typical South American tempo -- slow approach then
rattlesnake finish -- and manager Terry Venables, without David Platt
and Paul Ince, has to get the midfield mix right. The need to retain
possession puts the emphasis on passers like Gascoigne and John Barnes.
England (possible): D Seaman (Arsenal), R Jones (Liverpool), T Adams
(Arsenal), S Howey (Newcastle), G Le Saux (Blackburn), R Lee
(Newcastle), J Barnes (Liverpool) or P Gascoigne (Rangers), J Redknapp
(Liverpool), D Wise (Chelsea), P Beardsley (Newcastle), A Shearer
(Blackburn).
* LIVERPOOL'S #2m teenager Mark Kennedy yesterday made a 75-mile
emergency dash to join Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland squad for
their vital European Championship qualifier against Austria.
Kennedy, who seemed set to make his fifth appearance for the Irish
Under-21 team in Amstetten, was given the urgent call after Bolton
midfielder Jason McAteer made a last-minute withdrawal from Charlton's
squad.
This trip could mark Kennedy's debut in his familiar role wide on the
left.
Charlton, who has also lost Aston Villa's Steve Staunton and
Blackburn's Jeff Kenna through injuries, admits: ''I've only got five
midfield players left and that's why we've called up young Kennedy. I'm
not saying he will play, but you might be surprised by the team I
pick.''
The absence of McAteer, believed to be the subject of a three-way #4m
transfer tug-of-war involving Arsenal, Everton, and Liverpool, is the
latest blow to hit Charlton's plans for a crucial Group 6 encounter.
Privately, Charlton is seething over Bolton's failure to notify him of
the player's withdrawal until around noon yesterday, but he said: ''The
kid is under a bit of pressure.''
Liverpool's Phil Babb is also out with a knee injury said to have been
suffered in pre-season training, even though he has since appeared in
the Premiership. Charlton is unhappy about this situation as well. But
he will call up Manchester City's Alan Kernaghan as replacement
centre-half and says: ''There's not much I can do when clubs pull their
players out.''
He still believes he has sufficient firepower to avenge the 3-1 defeat
inflicted by Austria in Dublin just seven days after Ireland's 0-0
Liechtenstein flop. He said: ''We have Andy Townsend and Roy Keane back
in midfield now after they both missed those two games, and they will
make us a lot stronger.''
* BOLTON'S Owen Coyle is still on Dundee United's hit list as they
continue their search for a striker to fire up their promotion
challenge.
But manager Billy Kirkwood last night knocked down suggestions that
United are setting up a swop deal which would take Scotland midfielder
Billy McKinlay to the English outfit.
* ROY Aitken yesterday collected his first trophy since taking charge
at Aberdeen. He won the Bells premier-division manager-of-month award
for steering the Dons back to the top of the league and into the
quarter-finals of the Coca-Cola Cup.

One of the joys of being ill, for ANDREW POPPLE, was the licence to be
grumpy, unreasonable, and to retire to the sickbed, but try explaining
that to the kids . . .
WELL, the school holidays are over, and without major incident in our
household, thankfully. The good weather undoubtedly helped, and the time
seems to have passed so quickly. Until, that is, within a week or so of
the end. I fell ill -- only for a few days, and recovered quickly, so no
sympathy is required. But in those few days I learnt quite an important
lesson, one which had totally escaped me while my wife was chief carer
-- either doing it herself or looking after arrangements such as a
nanny.
My wife is seldom ill, I do not call her She Who Must Be Obeyed
because to say it implies there may be an alternative and such thoughts
are treason, but She With The Iron Constitution would be a fair
representation. On the rare occasions she is poorly she is stoic, and
short-tempered too. So when she was in charge of looking after the
children, my offers to help were rather half-hearted, and her rejection
quickly snapped up as my let-out. I would trot off to work with a
relatively clear conscience, leaving her to look after two young
children from her sickbed. After all, it's what she said she wanted,
isn't it?
Now I have sampled the delights of caring for the little darlings,
coping with their exuberance, while feeling like death (I am a man,
therefore I exaggerate my pain), I realise what a trial it is. There is
no such thing as sick leave for a housemum or dad. Needing to sleep but
having to listen for telltale sounds of warfare or demolition, and being
called upon to prepare lunch when even the thought -- let along the
smell -- of food is unbearable, is truly awful.
A friend tells of an episode when she actually had to crawl around the
kitchen, she didn't have enough energy to stand for any length of time.
And we are only talking about the ubiquitous tummy bugs, flu and so on.
Usually the upside to such illnesses is that you know they are
short-lived and not life threatening, you can be quiet and alone, have a
bit of time when the world expects little from you. Not with children.
The milk carton has one of those seals they could usefully employ at
Barlinnie. The hamster gets stuck under the piano. The paddling pool has
become a graveyard for wasps. And the salaried employee -- I know better
than to refer to her as The Worker; I'm one too, even if unpaid -- is
long gone to her safe haven.
Even the children's thoughtfulness becomes a burden. Being woken up to
find out if I was asleep and if I would not like a biscuit, regular
presentations of proudly made Get Well Soon cards, do not speed the
healing process. Getting stroppy with them is hurtful and makes things
worse all round. One of the joys of being ill is the licence to be
grumpy and unreasonable, but you try explaining that to the kids.
However, I can report that I was left to cope for as little a time as
my wife could organise -- she does not live by an ''it's his turn to
suffer'' philosophy, thank goodness. And I was not expected to have
prepared tea, done the ironing, mown the lawns. Somewhat different to my
(former) attitude. There's nothing like first-hand experience to change
your perceptions.
The next Great Test will be when I am ill during term time and have to
get them to school, or perhaps when one of the children succumbs and the
logic of needing to be in two places at once defeats me. At least there
will now be two of us who appreciate the difficulties.

I do remember Alan Hansen playing. I haven't modelled myself on
anyone, but Alex McLeish has been pointing me in the right direction
PINNING labels on emerging stars is one of football folk's favourite
pastimes, but they rarely turn out accurate. However, at least one
aspect of the title bestowed on 21-year-old Peter Handyside by national
manager Craig Brown -- ''the new Alan Hansen'' -- appears safe enough.
The tall defender, who plays for Grimsby Town, seems to be in the same
laid-back mode as the former Partick Thistle and Liverpool man, and
looks well able to cope with that daunting assessment.
Maybe anybody who manages to attract such praise when playing for
Grimsby is entitled to be considered psychologically sound, anyway, but
Handyside, who returns to the Under-21 team to face Finland tomorrow
afternoon, comes across as a lad rooted in commonsense.
''I felt that was a tremendous compliment coming from Craig Brown,''
he said, ''and I do remember Alan Hansen playing. I haven't modelled
myself on anyone, however, but I have had a lot of help from people at
Grimsby and Alex McLeish has been pointing me in the right direction.''
McLeish, assistant to Tommy Craig with the Under-21s, might have been
interested to know that the team he now manages, Motherwell, took the
teenage Handyside with them to a tournament but did not follow up with
an offer. Handyside, who played in the Ayrshire league, took up his
''last option'' -- Grimsby -- although he had never heard of the town.
It says a great deal for him and the first-division club that he has
made such impressive progress.
Handyside last played for the Under-21s against Greece at Broadwood
Park, where he returns tomorrow. He comes back in good time, as Steven
Pressley drops out because of suspension, following a second booking
against Greece last month. The Grimsby player will slip into the Dundee
United man's role alongside another Tannadice man, Christian Dailly, who
has amassed a record 29 caps at this level.
The Under-21s' captain, like Handyside, believes there is such a good
spirit about this current side that it has had a serious influence on
their progress to date. ''Most of us keep pretty close contact away from
the field, which is probably a bit unusual, but we get on really well
and I am sure that helps on the park.''
Dailly, who missed the last game because of injury -- his place was
taken by another Tannadice team-mate, David Hannah, who is injured this
time -- could set up a record of Under-21 honours that might never be
beaten anywhere in the world. If the Scots beat Finland, it will
virtually secure their place in the quarter-finals and offer more
opportunities to be capped.
''That would be great but we are in this to try and win the European
Championship, so that has to be first priority, but only after we
concentrate on beating Finland.''
Craig had intended announcing his team yesterday, but decided to take
advantage of the extra 24 hours and will make the final list today for
the match, which kicks off at 1pm at Broadwood tomorrow. ''I am very
happy with the squad,'' he said, ''but I expect this to be a real
cup-tie because of what is at stake.''
The young Finnish side are desperately keen to reach the Olympics and
they need to qualify to do that. The probability, then, is that there
will be no safety-first play between the sides tomorrow.
* FALKIRK are still making strenuous efforts to bring former Hearts
and Rangers midfield man, Derek Ferguson, to Brockville. Falkirk are
willing to offer their biggest fee yet, around #250,000, but Sunderland
are understood to be looking for close to #400,000.
The chances are a compromise will be reached in time for Ferguson to
play against his old team, Hearts, at Tynecastle on Saturday.

DR J M Reid with some moderation tells us that homosexuals are
predetermined before birth to be so (September 1). Some may be, though I
like incontrovertible evidence that this has been proven 100%.
But even if true, it does not exonerate homosexuals from responsible
behaviour in a society bigger than they are. That is the point of moral
consciousness and willpower (the latter notoriously difficult to teach).
Non-sexual friendships are a different issue and may be harmless.
Some heterosexuals may be genetically so heterosexual that they are
promiscuous. That does not exonerate them from mending their ways.
In one way or another all human beings ''have fallen short of the
glory of God''. Let us therefore be as tolerant of John Macleod's
unfortunate tendency to dig the grave of his own sometimes basically
good arguments.
As to the World Health Organisation's statistics on heterosexuals and
Aids it would be interesting to discover whether the statistics tell us
whether these particular heterosexuals were wholly heterosexual, and if
so whether they were in contact with some who were not.
Be that as it may, let us not be afraid to accept that anti-social
behaviour is ''sinful'' or ''evil''. To condemn the fault is not to
condemn beyond ''redemption'' those who commit it.
But reasonable steps must be taken to prevent some members of an
admitted minority from diverting young people from a normal use of their
anatomy. Were we not designed (even regardless of the Bible's comment)
to ''go forth and multiply'' -- again within reason?

It may be frayed at the edges, but the glory of this festival is its
unpredictability, maintains MARK FISHER
THE Edinburgh Fringe is so big, its magnetic pull so strong, that like
a neighbouring planet warping the passage of light, it distorts your
normal pattern of reasoning. How else could it be that you can get to
the end of three weeks of the most excessive cultural overload and still
complain there was nothing much to see?
When you know you could comfortably have taken in 10 shows a day and
still only have scratched the surface, is it anything less than over-fed
decadence to grumble about an uninspiring year?
Well, yes, of course. Any theatre-goer making an adroit journey
through the Fringe, seeing maybe one or two shows a day with the odd
excursion to the International Festival, would have had a month's worth
of entertainment of a range and quality unparalleled anywhere in the
world.
That, though, is true of any year. What struck me about this year's
event was just how infrequently I heard word of amazing new finds,
stunning performances and unexpected delights. By the start of Week
Three I'd usually expect to have a want list of impossible proportions.
This year by that point, I was still taking chances on shows just
because they were on (no bad thing) and feeling none of that pathetic
cultural insecurity about not being where it was at.
To an extent that was because many of the best shows had already done
the rounds. The hottest tickets from the Scottish contingent, for
example, were for the Traverse's Bondagers (for which actor Kathyrn
Howden won a Herald Angel), 7:84's The Salt Wound, Communicado's A Place
With The Pigs and the Citizens' Trainspotting, all of which are great,
and all of which, give or take the odd cast change, I'd seen before.
And yes, I would have liked to have found time to see Deckchair
Theatre's Ningali, the Grassmarket Project's 20/52 and Starving Artists'
Road Movie (all, incidentally, at the Traverse which had a great year at
the box office), but even then I feel I know what I've missed. Much of
what I did see was weak or passable, which to an extent is an acceptable
consequence of taking chances on such a huge festival, but there were
also serious disappointments, notably from the South African Mouthpiece
Theatre with Feedback (physically impressive but dull) and compatriots
the Market Theatre with Take the Floor (plain feeble).
Enough of the groaning. The glory of Edinburgh is its
unpredictability, and if you set out to look for this year's equivalent
of last year's hit, you're sure to end up looking in the wrong place.
The most exciting events tend to be those that straddle barriers, that
appeal to a wide audience while seeming wholly original. There was even
a moment somewhere in the middle of the Festival when, having seen Mark
Morris's Hard Nut, Ray Davies's soft pop, plus a helping of stand-up
comedy, I half convinced myself that straight theatre had become too
cerebral a pleasure and unabashed entertainment was where it was at.
Certainly, I don't think I saw a more straight-forwardly enjoyable
show than that put on by the Tap Dogs (also on the receiving end of the
coveted Herald Angel), the hunky Australian tap troupe with a
barnstorming display of masculinity and bravura, brilliantly
choreographed and breathlessly performed. There can't have been a more
in-demand show in town, the last week selling out before it began.
That seemed special, as did Carmen Funebre, a short outdoor
performance by Poland's Teatr Biuro Podrozy, an atmospheric,
invigorating, and chilling response to the war in Bosnia, featuring
dominating warlords on stilts, scenes of cruelty and devastation, and
the memorably poetic image of candles being carried off to heaven by
balloons. It was attracting huge crowds by the end of its week-long run
and was the Edinburgh highlight of Richard Demarco's programme, which
otherwise somehow failed to spark into life this year. His was still the
most international and intriguing venue on the Fringe, but for much of
the time it was all performers and no audience and, though there was
much that was worth while, only one or two things stood out.
This was not the case with Demarco's venture into Dundee which might
have failed to lure Fringe-goers northwards but repaid the extra effort
with a reportedly stunning show from Yvette Bozsik (one I was sad to
miss and another Angel winner) and a brilliant Lithuanian absurdist
piece, There To Be Here, by the Oskaro Kursonovo Grupe which I saw in a
pitifully small audience one Tuesday afternoon. The Dundee experiment
emphasised that the appeal of Edinburgh as a festival city is its
compactness, though the idea that the rest of Scotland might more
actively participate in it is still one worth pursuing.
Aside from that, it was the year of the French. Once we'd got a couple
of disappointingly lily-livered protests at nuclear testing in the
Pacific out of the way (first a handful of comedians who stood no chance
of winning the Perrier Award vowed to boycott it, then two leafleters
who stood outside Theatre Workshop got invited into Embarquez-les and
said they quite enjoyed it), it was clear that the French were setting
the standard for visually engaging, if not always philosophically
profound, theatre. There were three such companies at Theatre Workshop,
the year's most consistently satisfying venue, as well as the two major
contributions to the International Festival.
Finally, a mention for the one original acting discovery. Danny Hoch
performed a one-man show at the Traverse which trawled the streets of
New York to present a host of characters who, in their fascinating
variations on standard English, revealed a side of the city rarely
acknowledged by the mass media.
Watching this show for a second time, funny, clever, and ruthlessly
well observed as it was, confirmed my suspicions that this young
performer still has his best work ahead of him. Which is just one of the
many reasons why, for all my scepticism, I'm already looking forward to
next year's Fringe.

''IF you liked Shirley Valentine, says the advert, ''you'll love
Julie.''
And judging by the predominantly female audience last night (three
weeks of wall-to-wall theatre across the city and still the King's can
fill the house for another show), they pretty much pitched their
marketing right.
Though it's hard not to regard Patrick Edgeworth's new play as
terribly much more than shrewd marketing. No doubt the chance to see
Millicent Martin (TW3 etc) and Anne Charleston (Madge from Neighbours)
is a significant lure, but what the audience gets is a light comedy
rather calculatedly aimed at the market for women of a certain age.
Millicent Martin plays an ex-pat housewife living in Australia (no
reason for the setting as far as I can make out) who discovers, when her
husband leaves her for a younger woman, that she can have a love life of
her own. A rasping Anne Charleston plays the brassy neighbour who tells
her as much.
But if we use the Willie Russell play as a comparison (there are
shades of Educating Rita too), it is clear that Martin's character is
sent on a journey of little emotional range and one that fights shy of
the extremes from which compelling drama can emerge.
The fact that the show is warmly received does indicate a need for
these voices to be heard, the act of telling a deceiving husband where
to go was lapped up by the audience, but the message that older women
have it in them to take control of their lives feels a little tired.
Still, it's warm-hearted and unpretentious, and will no doubt go down
just as well when it plays Glasgow next month.

Name that game: The golfers in the forefront of Edward Jones' photo
from yesterday's Herald are so engrossed in their game that they are
oblivious to the passing QE2 on only her third visit to the Clyde since
her 1967 launch. Even more curious is that there are rather a lot of
them, six in fact, each clutching a putter.
It could be a sixball, but we doubt whether a frowned-upon form of the
game like this would be allowed at such a respected club as Greenock.
Perhaps a threeball sixsome, a game favoured by the gentlemen of
Prestwick. Or it could be a six-way play-off for the monthly medal.

THE 1995 cereal harvest is set to exceed 22 million tonnes of largely
top- quality grain, according to preliminary estimates from Dalgety
Agriculture's nationwide annual harvest yield and quality survey.
The survey covers 1000 farms and, having processed results from nearly
half of them, Dalgety's crop marketing manager, Andrew Barnard, is
predicting a UK wheat harvest of 14 million tonnes and a national barley
crop of about seven million tonnes.
Southern wheat crops have suffered from the exceptionally hot summer
but Yorkshire and Scotland have shown excellent results.
''The overall cereal harvest is significantly higher than last year,
but we do not see any problems in disposing of our exportable surpluses
of either wheat or barley,'' said Mr Barnard.
Commenting on the trade in Scotland, Roger Baird, a director of grain
merchant JD Martin, which operates in Fife, the Lothians and the
Borders, said: ''I think everyone is very happy.''
The malting barley market, he said, had eased slightly with samples
around 1.6% nitrogen still making upwards of #1.40. However, the higher
nitrogen barleys of 1.8% were harder to shift.
Feed barley is hovering around #100 ex-farm with feed wheat at #106.
Meanwhile, the milling oat market is largely governed by contract
prices which are set commonly at #10 over the feed price. Oilseed rape
yields have also been good and the spot price is close to #170. There's
every chance that cereal prices worldwide will firm with supplies being
at a low level.
The only commodity which has actually fallen in price is straw in the
wake of what Mr Baird called ''huge crops''. Barley straw in round bales
is worth #25 per tonne ex-farm which is close on half the value of a
month ago when the trade opened up with memories of last year's extreme
shortage.

SCOTTISHPOWER shareholders rubber-stamped the company's #1000m hostile
bid for Manweb yesterday, but the board gave little away about its plans
for the Chester-based utility.
Chairman Murray Stuart refused to give a commitment that the present
offer would not be revised upwards. But he said the cash-plus-shares
offer, worth 987[1/2]p per share at yesterday's closing prices, and its
all-cash alternative of 915p represented ''full value'' for Manweb.
He continued to insist that it was a high-cost distribution company
that had little potential on its own.
Chief executive Ian Robinson also kept his cards close to his chest,
refusing to spell out how ScottishPower planned to cut costs and boost
profits at the power distribution company which supplies Merseyside and
North Wales.
He said ScottishPower had set up a team headed by an executive
director that was ready to move into Manweb and implement staff cuts and
technical improvements, but he refused to give details of the
restructuring plan.
ScottishPower officials said it would be led by corporate resources
director Mike Kinski, but Mr Robinson declined to confirm this.
The chief executive even refrained from criticising the electricity
industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, who had argued
unsuccessfully for ScottishPower's bid to be referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
''He is the man in the job and he is performing that task
satisfactorily,'' Mr Robinson said after the extraordinary general
meeting in Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall.
But he hinted that Professor Littlechild should spend more time
preparing for the total deregulation of the electricity supply industry
in 1998 than on trying to block individual takeovers. ''I think the
issue that the regulator has to work on is getting ready for 1998,'' he
said.
After that date, domestic consumers will be free to purchase their
electricity from any distributor in the country. At present, only
industrial customers that consume more than 100 megawatts may do so.
Several small shareholders at the meeting spoke passionately against
the bid for Manweb, notably Aleck Shepherd, a retired further education
teacher from Linlithgow, who wanted the board to boost shareholder value
through a share buy-back instead.
But Mr Stuart had come to the meeting with proxy votes representing
44% of ScottishPower shares in his pocket and nearly all of these were
in favour of the Manweb bid.
Resolutions approving the bid were carried overwhelmingly in a show of
hands by the 200 shareholders present.
Manweb has until September 15 to detail its defence against the bid,
which many City analysts believe will have to be raised slightly in
order to clinch the deal.
One electricity analyst with a London broker said yesterday that fund
managers appeared happy to sell REC shares at around 980p, a level which
ScottishPower's shares-plus-cash bid for Manweb has already reached,
after starting at 946p in July.
But the analyst, who declined to be named, added that ScottishPower
may have to improve its 915p all-cash alternative to narrow the
differential.
ScottishPower shares rose 2p to 346 yesterday, while Manweb's gained
6p to 984p.

ABERDEEN University last night announced the establishment of an Oil
and Gas Institute aimed at maintaining and enhancing the city's position
at the heart of the international offshore industry.
The institute, which will be based on new and existing centres of
expertise at the university, is one of the initiatives identified to
mark the university's quincentenary and has attracted significant
support from BP.
The oil major has seconded George Greig, until recently its northern
lines manager, as the institute's first director, and has also donated
#100,000 to fund oil and gas-based projects.
Dr Greig, who has 26 years experience in the industry, will be
consulting widely over the next few months and working to encourage
''closer links, wider understanding, and better awareness of the current
and potential cost-effective capabilities offered by the university''.
The creation of the institute was announced at the Offshore Europe
dinner in Aberdeen by the university's principal, Professor Maxwell
Irvine. He said: ''For some time the university has had expertise
relevant to the wide scope of activities encompassed by the oil and gas
industry.
''Our engineers, geologists, economists, environmental scientists,
lawyers and sociologists have played their part in the growth of
Aberdeen as an international oil centre.
''Recent senior appointments in the key areas of engineering, safety,
geology, commercial law and management have reinforced this and we
expect to continue to strengthen our capabilities and resources, where
appropriate, as the Oil and Gas Institute develops to meet the changing
needs of the industry. The key is the quality of our research and
accessibility to it through the institute.
''It is most appropriate that this initiative, which relates closely
to the future prosperity and standing of our community, should be
established in our quincentenary year. The institute will take full
advantage of information technology and the recently established
Aberdeen metropolitan area network, a local high-speed computer network
linked to the internet.''
The research teams will draw on expertise and facilities within the
specialist areas of the university, with individual members transferring
information through an organisational structure focused and directed for
the particular task.
Greg Bourne, BP's general manager, said: ''Clearly Aberdeen is one of
the key international centres in the industry and BP has a
long-established presence within the city. As part of our continuing
commitment to learning we are delighted to be able to support this
far-sighted initiative arising from the University of Aberdeen's
quincentenary celebrations.
''The formation of the Oil and Gas Institute should bring marked
benefits to the university, the local community and particularly to the
industry on which its activities will be focused.
''At BP, as a result of new commercial pressures and technical
challenges facing us, we have changed our style of operation and
management. Having gone through this process as one of our senior
managers, Dr Greig is well placed to use his skills and experience
assisting the university in its goal of building stronger links with the
sector to develop a thriving research nucleus in Aberdeen.''

SPENDING on the UK Continental Shelf on exploration, appraisal,
development, and production of oil and gas will total #45bn during the
next five years, according to forecasts for the industry by Scottish
Enterprise, writes GRAEME SMITH.
The agency also expects worldwide expenditure, which will create
significant opportunities for Scottish companies, to total #625bn.
The biennial forecasts of UK and worldwide upstream activity and
expenditure were published by the Scottish Enterprise Energy Group as
the delegates and visitors gathered in Aberdeen for the Offshore Europe
Oil and Gas Conference.
They point to 22 northern and 47 central North Sea fields, three
Atlantic Frontier, and four Irish Sea fields, coming on stream during
the next four years.
In the Southern Gas Basin, 28 new fields are forecast to begin
production during the same period.
Overall annual UK expenditure will reach #8400m this year, rising to
#9100m in 1997 with a slight decline to #9000m in 1998 before rising to
a new peak of almost #2000m in 1999.
The biggest annual rise is expected next year when total expenditure
will rise by almost #500m because of several new field developments,
particularly in the central North Sea.
The analysis was carried out by Scottish Enterprise with the
assistance of MAI Consultants and Aberdeen University Petroleum Economic
Consultants.
''The forecasts are of direct relevance to all Scottish-based
companies involved in the upstream oil and gas industry,'' said Kourosh
Bassiti, head of Scottish Enterprise's Energy Group.
''They are intended to be readily usable for strategic planning by
companies across the whole spectrum of service and supply activities.
''The forecasts show UK spending will peak in 1999 due principally to
the impact of new field developments and abandonment deferral projects,
therefore there is still substantial life in the UKCS market for
Scottish-based companies.''

RHONE-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) yesterday denied a report that it was about
to raise its bid terms for pharmaceutical group Fisons but the market is
still banking on this or some outside deal. Fisons' shares are standing
at 257p against the hostile bid price of 240p which values the company
at #1700m.
Other possible options open to Fisons include a counterbid by a
''white knight'', which is looking increasingly unlikely or a
straightforward merger with another company making it a bigger mouthful
to swallow.
However, in presenting the group's defence document, Fisons' chief
executive, Stuart Wallis, said no news was expected soon although
negotiations were continuing with a number of people.
In its defence document, described as containing nothing new by RPR,
Fisons emphasised the considerable value within the company which the
bid does not recognise, much of it relating to the excellence of its
respiratory drug delivery device technology and know-how for the
treatment of respiratory diseases.
Fisons has been busy selling major parts of its business, including
research and development and laboratory, in order to concentrate on its
inhaler technology which would protect the sales of its older products,
Tilade and Intal, and expand its markets. It wants to allow access to
these technologies in return for the right to sell other companies'
products.
The company said its expertise in respiratory systems is so well
respected that many companies seek to use its technology with their own
drugs.
In addition, several other companies alert to the changes taking place
within the pharmaceutical industry, have adopted the same strategy and,
unlike them, Fisons has an international sales and marketing
infrastructure which can exploit opportunities worldwide.
The company reiterated that estimated disposal proceeds of more than
#600m will enable rapid and aggressive implementation of its strategy.
The first closing date for the bid is next Monday and RPR needs to be
in no hurry to make any fresh move though some raising the ante seems
likely later on.
RPR said the defence document confirmed its view that, having taken
steps to divest its non-pharmaceutical activities and its pharmaceutical
research operations, Fisons faces a long uphill struggle as it attempts
to build on its stalled pharmaceutical franchise.

FAMILY businesses in Northern Ireland are better run and outperform
similar firms in Scotland with better sales and rates of growth,
according to research to be made public today.
The research was commissioned by Scottish Enterprise to look at the
nature of family business in the two countries and investigate the
emerging challenges facing Scotland's family firms. It was carried out
by the Centre for Family Enterprise at Glasgow Caledonian University.
Among the speakers at the Managing Successful Family Businesses in
Scotland conference in Glasgow will be former world motor racing
champion Jackie Stewart and his son Paul who run the highly successful
company, Paul Stewart Racing.
Barbara Dunn, director of the Centre for Family Enterprise, said:
''Family businesses in Scotland and Northern Ireland share the same
characteristics as others around the world, although in Scotland they do
seem to be more closely managed and held by the family members.''
She added that the rate of growth in Scotland can be ''outstanding''
but is ''generally modest'' compared to elsewhere, and family businesses
in Northern Ireland outperform those in Scotland in terms of size,
sales, and longevity.
One of the most important issues facing family firms is that of
succession. The research shows that in half of Scotland's family firms a
succession will take place within 10 years. Prospects for success,
however, are poor because thoughts about planning are not translated
into action plans.
Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, who will
also address the conference said: ''Recognition of the role that family
businesses play in providing jobs and wealth is an important new
development in the economy. In many ways Scotland is leading in this
process.''
The conference is being held in the Buchanan Restaurant at Glasgow's
Royal Concert Hall.

I AM writing to tell you how much your letters section meant to my
husband, John McKay, who no doubt inundated you with letters over many
years.
A week before his death he was on Harris and I had some little
difficulty getting your paper for him. He told me not to bother because
he could always find the news anywhere, it was joining the debate about
the issues involved in the news that he cared about.
''I don't want to be told facts,'' he said, ''I want to talk back.''
He also enjoyed continuing the discussion with fellow letter-writers
which seems to have gone on weeks after the issue left your pages.
Perhaps this is the way ahead for newspapers in modern times. Like
him, I find that more and more I skip the front pages and go straight to
the editorial, the letters, the articles and the comment.
My thanks go to the many unknown correspondents who have written to me
since. John knew he had not got long to live. He had finished his
biography of William Gallacher and his crippled hand could still only
just write to you.

SCOTTISH engineering and distribution group Fife Indmar enjoyed a
strong start to 1995 and is launching a drive into export markets.
Pre-tax profits soared 39% to #601,000 in the six months to June 30,
out-pacing a 9% rise in turnover to #18.0m.
The Edinburgh-based group felt confident enough to raise the interim
dividend by 33% to 1.0p from 0.75p, but brokers said it was unlikely to
maintain this rate of growth for the full-year payout.
''It's a good result . . . and our order books are healthy,'' said
managing director Tim Gutteridge.
Fife Indmar makes most of its money from distributing ironmongery in
Scotland and selling and hiring specialist offshore engineering
equipment.
The group also makes precision engineering equipment, including parts
for Challenger tanks, Rolls-Royce aero engines and Hewlett Packard
computers, at factories in Scotland and England.
Mr Gutteridge said two new export initiatives should help boost growth
in the second half of the year.
Fife Indmar has set up a joint venture with the Singapore state-owned
engineering firm Sembawang Systems to sell and hire out pressure
instrumentation and calibration equipment throughout Asia.
This will start trading in the final quarter of the year, and Mr
Gutteridge said it should eventually generate several million pounds of
turnover a year.
Fife Indmar has also appointed distribution agents in Germany for the
mobile lighting towers manufactured by its Blackburn engineering
subsidiary, Park Products.
Until now, nearly all of Fife Indmar's business has been UK-based,
with exports accounting for only 3% of turnover.
The group completed its withdrawal from the catering business by
closing its Newcastle-based catering distribution company Truscott at
the end of June.
But the resulting #134,000 charge was largely offset by a #92,000
profit contribution from its latest acquisition, Safety and Technical
Lifting Services (STLS).
STLS, which was acquired in March, sells and hires out sub-sea
hydraulic tensioning equipment for North Sea oil and gas platforms.
Mr Gutteridge said Fife Indmar was now looking to expand through
organic growth rather than acquisitions, although it was always on the
lookout for new opportunities in the distribution business.
Fife Indmar shares closed unchanged at 53p.

THE private healthcare market continues to grow as the population
becomes more elderly.
Although the vast majority of private operators provide residential
care for the frail and elderly, some companies are adding specialist
services for all age groups. Crestacare is one of them.
In the space of just over two years the proportion of its turnover
based on delivering specialised care services has risen from 5% to
23.4%.
A 90-bed specialist facility opened in Kirkintilloch in January for
the elderly mentally infirm. This increased the number of Crestacare's
Scottish beds to 685, equivalent to just under a quarter of the group's
total.
Other specialist facilities look after patients suffering from brain
and stroke related injuries, alcohol-related dementia, and the young
physically disabled.
In the half-year to June 30 profit before tax rose by 34% to #3.3m.
Turnover in continuing operations rose by 34% to #21m with Scotcare
contributing #4.7m. Fees rose by 3% to an average of #306 per week.
Earnings per share increased by 23% to 1.4p. The interim dividend goes
up by 12% to 0.29p.
The Scotcare acquisition is said to have been successfully integrated
into the group and Dr Magdy Ishak was appointed as an executive director
to the group board.
Occupancy levels in the group's nursing homes slipped to 91% as a
result of lower referrals from cash-strapped local authorities in the
first three months of the year and a busy expansion programme. However,
costs remain under control and gearing at the half year was 35%.
The group anticipates that a period of further transition in the
marketplace could see a further decline in its occupancy level for
traditional elderly care.
The accounting policies of the nursing home sector have come in for
criticism in the past because of the capitalisation of interest and lack
of depreciation of property.
Crestacare said it would ''rather be at the forefront'' of such issues
and has decided to depreciate its freehold properties from January 1
this year at 2% per annum. This is expected to cost #1.6m in the current
financial year, a figure that will be borne in the full-year accounts.
Crestacare is the third-largest private provider of long-term
healthcare services in the UK. Chief executive Andrew Taee believes the
increasing focus of the group towards specialist care services and
private patients in southern England will provide ''stronger and more
sustainable earnings in the years ahead''.
As a whole the publically listed nursing home groups account for only
around 6% of the market, illustrating the ample scope for future
expansion.
At the half-year end, Crestacare operated 48 long-term health care
facilities with 2910 beds. By the end of the year, 50 facilities are
expected to be in operation with the possibility of the group's first
foray into the London market.
It is also holding talks with various local authorities on the
possibility of providing other community-based daycare services such as
dialysis.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, who recently retired from the chairmanship of
Hewden Stuart, has been appointed non-executive chairman of Crestacare.
The group's shares gained half-a-penny to 31p.

EVEN when its lead in the opinion polls has resembled a yawning chasm,
I have continued to treat the view that Labour to form the next
Government is the nearest thing we have to a racing certainty in modern
politics with a double dash of scepticism. That's not always been the
most comfortable stance to adopt.
The Major administration remains deeply unpopular in the most
unexpected places. You'd be surprised at the leading business figures
who, in a quiet off-the-record moment, will share their utter contempt
for the present lot. It's not just the world-weariness after 16 years in
power. It's not just the gaffes, the banana skins, and the general air
of drift.
It's the sense that the Tories have fouled many of the nests which, in
elections past, have been utterly predictable in their support for
Conservative values. The better-off elderly and the managerial middle
class -- broad swathes of home-owning Middle England -- seem intent on
punishing the Tories for ushering in a world in which the real value of
your home can fall, the white-collar over-fifties seem surplus to labour
market requirements, and the asset-rich elderly have to sell their homes
-- and quash their heirs' inheritance hopes -- to pay for residential
care.
Add to that picture sullen consumers, a faltering economic recovery,
and a Chancellor who will need all his considerable skills of
prestidigitation to convince anyone that tax cuts this November are
anything more than a cheap election bribe, lace with the ongoing whiff
of what the public sees as corrupt self-interest as ex-Minister after
ex-Minister makes the seamless transition from Government Rover to
boardroom table and you'd be hard-pressed to argue rationally why Labour
is anything other than a shoe-in, whenever Mr Major chooses to go to the
polls.
And yet the doubts remain. They predate the abrupt ending, this
summer, of Mr Blair's love-affair with much of the traditionally
right-wing press. They predate the rumblings, some might say eruptions,
on Labour's traditionalist left as discontent over the direction New
Labour is headed in broke surface.
They centre on whether Labour has any convincing new answers to the
core problems which are troubling millions of people today, as never
before. If the Blair Model Labour Party has no new big idea then, in the
heat of the next election battle, it is perfectly conceivable that
enough people will be scared of change, because it might hit them even
harder in their pocketbooks, to deny Labour victory. We could yet see a
rerun of 1992.
The thing about really big ideas is that they refuse to be confined by
department briefs or the amour propre of this Minister (real or shadow)
or that. Political parties, in government and all the subsidiary ideas,
like privatisation, which flowed from it owed more to the Adam Smith
Institute and the bright young fringe ideologues around Sir Keith Joseph
in the 1970s than to the Tory politicians who were later expected to put
the ideas into practice.
There are, it seems to me, in the central troubling concerns that
beset Britain in 1995, the ingredients for a new approach, the raw
materials for that elusive big idea. But I remain less than convinced
that Labour has the will or the inspiration to bake the policy cake. Ask
people to list their central concerns as the millennium approaches and
the answers have a striking consistency. They fret about the future of
work, both for themselves and for their children. And that present job
insecurity triggers a more distant concern, about whether their pension
will finance a dignified -- and, on present trends, longer -- old age.
These twin sets of concerns buttress neatly with another widespread
worry -- the burgeoning national bill for welfare and how it is to be
financed in the longer term.
Let's try to navigate a preliminary path through the maze. Work is
harder to come by in 1995 than it was in 1975 because employers are
expected to be far more productive and competitive than they were then.
Part of the pressure is the accelerating pace of technological change
and the industrialisation of large areas of the Third World. But part is
also the expectation of investors that companies must deliver better and
better short-term returns. Dominant among those investors are pension
funds and insurance companies seeking the wherewithal to finance each
successive retired generation's expectations of a comfortable old age.
As the pressure on companies to perform grows, they hack deeper and
deeper into their cost base, shedding more people in the process. The
screw turns in the jobs market. Those still in work, work harder. Among
those most likely to volunteer for a voluntary redundancy programme are
one-company men and women, with many years accumulated pension
entitlement.
If they choose to go in their early fifties, they are, arguably, the
least well equipped to search out new job challenges. With decades of
pensioned life ahead of them, they, cumulatively, add to the pressure on
the companies they are leaving to perform even better. The screw turns
in the pensions market.
Where companies eventually resort to less voluntary means of cutting
costs, among the casualties are the recent recruits, a generation
growing used to short contracts and other casualised modern variants of
a job for life. More and more of them drift out of the formal labour
market altogether and resort, together with the already long-term
jobless, to a twilight world of welfare benefits and cash-in-hand work
the Revenue never sees. The screw turns in the welfare bill.
In some countries, like Japan, there is an urgent public debate about
how the economy can sustain a rapidly ageing population longer term.
Here the debate is a mere whisper. Our politicians are still stuck in a
fruitless debate about which party can usher in a new age of full
employment. The truth is none of them can.
What we urgently need is some fresh thinking about how the work that
is available can be shared more equitably. Giving everyone who wants it
the prospect of a decently rewarded economic stake in society is a far
better way to reduce the ballooning welfare budget than cutting the
entitlements of the already poor. Any party which comes up with a
credible solution to the problems I've outlined really would be on to a
big idea. Even I might be convinced they would sweep the polls next
time.

BRITAIN'S largest mortgage provider, the Halifax Building Society,
last night cut its basic home loan rate from 8.35% to 7.99%. The move
brings it into line with its nearest rival, Abbey National, which
announced a surprise reduction on Friday, writes R E DUNDAS.
But the Halifax, which called on the Government to bring in special
measures to help the depressed housing market, did not undercut the
Abbey, reducing the chances of a mortgage price cutting war.
Within minutes of the Halifax announcing its cut, Nationwide, the
second largest building society, confirmed it would be lowering its
mortgage rate. Other lenders are expected to make similar reductions.
The Abbey was immediately followed by the Northern Rock Building
Society, but others waited for the reaction of the Halifax. Its rate cut
applies immediately to new customers and to its 2.4 million existing
borrowers from October 1. No change has been made to the current range
of fixed-rate and discounted mortgages.
There was no change in seasonally-adjusted house prices in August,
according to the latest Halifax index. Prices declined in each of the
previous five months. In the year to August prices fell by 2.4%, which
is an improvement on July's 3.1%.

OH, call me a sentimentalist, but one of my favourite movies of all
time is Frank Kapra's It's A Wonderful Life (1947). You must have seen
it. Everyone has seen it. High on feel-good factor, the archetype of
American small-town hokum, it's wheeled out faithfully on wet BBC2
afternoons around Christmas, or any other occasion when one may
shamelessly lunge for the Kleenex.
It's A Wonderful Life stars James Stewart as a besieged and
increasingly embittered businessman in the cute anywhere-USA town of
Bedford Falls. It opens with Stewart's character, George Bailey, driven
beyond endurance by reverse and frustration, about to be framed for
embezzlement, and so poised to leap off a bridge and end it all, even
though it is Christmas Eve and America has just won the war. Then an
improbably folksy angel materialises, to show Bailey life as it would
have been had he never been born.
To cut a long story short, Bedford Falls would have been a total dump.
George Bailey repents; he returns to his life and, in the nick of time,
the little community rallies round him; all come together in a
whip-round, paying off the stolen funds. ''No man is poor who has
friends.'' But by this point I'm sobbing into the hanky.
No man is poor who has friends. Over the past week, I have been
vividly reminded of this. I was up in Harris, on the awkward task of
clearing a little house I had just sold, and untangling mortgage
politics for the final purchase of a new one. It was not an easy week.
Those things are always hassled. And yet it all fell, at last, into
place; and what might have been a most unpleasant few days ended, at
last, in happiness.
A good many folk contributed to this. Wise heads gave practical
advice. Houses offered hospitality. People inquired pleasantly on the
road. A fellow with whom relations had been strained took time out of
his lunch-break to mend fences -- I knew he hated being bothered at
work, but he emerged smiling, eating yoghurt with a spoon, and normal
service was resumed. I helped someone with her dissertation, and so felt
useful. A mate accompanied me back to the mainland, did the driving,
teased me out of Celtic gloom, put me up in his student flat, introduced
me to such delights as 10-pin bowling.
Friendship is something I take very seriously. Unfortunately, it is a
concept increasingly devalued in the modern world. Life is increasingly
a jungle, where no-one trusts anyone; the world of journalism is
especially nasty. People use the term ''friend'' too casually, when they
mean acquaintance; their workmate, or golf-partner, is someone they
hardly know at all. Women, I think, have a lot to teach men here. Most
women retain a little group of intimates, with whom they can share bad
feelings, with whom they can be vulnerable. Many men, by this standard,
have not a friend in the world.
One of the reasons I so detest the gay lobby is their part in debasing
friendship. So aware are we now of perversion, and so terrified are most
of us of being thought weird or unnatural, that few blokes care for
closeness with each other. Even the most natural physical contact --
beyond such defined zones as the football park -- is now avoided, for
fear of its connotations. Things have come to a pretty pass when a
teenager is visibly embarrassed by a handshake.
Friendship is an adventure; a constant odyssey in keeping your
relations in good repair, and in seeking out new soulmates, and being
ever alert to changing personality and circumstance. There are some key
principles worth bearing in mind. These have been borne out abundantly
in my own experience.
First: most worthwhile friendships start from a common base -- shared
interests, shared value, shared culture. All my buddies are from a
Highland, Presbyterian background, replete with mutual world-view and
appropriate in-jokes. Some of my happiest relationships, in fact, have
been with other sons (and one daughter) of the manse. Opposites may
attract; their relationship seldom endures.
Second: no-one, however warm or gifted, can have more than a tiny
number of true friends, people you know deeply, and to whom you are
bound in mutual commitment. One may belong to quite a large ''set'', a
gang of a dozen or so, with whom you go on assorted jolly jaunts. But I
refuse to take anyone seriously who claims to know more than four or
five people really well.
Third: friendship requires jolly hard work. Time must be invested in
conversation, perhaps correspondence, certainly a good deal of shared
time and shared experience. It calls for great sensitivity to mood. It
can call for great thought in difficult situations, when two of you are
caught up in wider events which threaten division.
It also calls for much common sense. Friendship is not marriage. It is
seldom life-long and must never be exclusive. Friends are not
accountable to us, as a wife or husband: they are not obliged to spill
their hearts, account for every hour of their time, or to justify the
way they live their lives to you.
One must accept that a friendship may fade through no fault of his or
yours. Folk grow up; people change; circumstances alter. On occasion a
declining friendship can grow so poisonous that it must be ruthlessly
ended.
On the other Opinion page some have lately bandied the word ''love''.
To me, love is intensely practical: not a matter of mushy emotion, but a
way of life -- the cold-blooded, at times teeth-gritted, decision to
treat someone well, to respect their feelings, their needs, their
privacy. I have also grown most suspicious of ''intimacy'', as commonly
defined -- knowing everything about a person, from their dreams to their
nightmares to their sexual histories. Good friendships rest on
understanding of the person, not stockpiled secrets of the man.
I have known my recent chauffeur for nine years. There are vast areas
of our lives we keep to ourselves. We would never, so help us, waste
time discussing Our Relationship. But that friendship has endured,
understated, when others, much more intense, have disintegrated.
All worthwhile human relationships demand commitment and a measure of
pain. We need, above all, forbearance; the ability to let little wrongs
go by without comment, the ability to forget the trivial for the sake of
the whole, the abiding awareness of our frailty and inadequacy.
To all my friends, the best; and especially those about to resume
mainland studies, in a much darker world for the young than mine of a
decade ago.

LABOUR MP George Robertson says the Tories should do a U-turn now on
water rather than wait until they are forced to as happened with the
poll tax.
I would remind Mr Robertson that if his party's advice on the
iniquitous poll tax had been taken we would all still be paying it. It
was a mass non-payment which put an end to this unwanted measure. My
feeling is that it would also take mass non-payment of water bills to
get water returned to local authority control -- where it ought to be in
the interests of democratic accountability.
And should water become privatised between now and the next General
Election, would a returned Labour Government be prepared to unravel the
pertinent legislation and take our water back into public ownership? And
pigs might fly.

DUNHILL CUP
GREG Norman, Nick Price, Ernie Els and two of this season's major
winners -- Ben Crenshaw and Steve Elkington -- will all be taking part
in the #1m Alfred Dunhill Cup at St Andrews on October 19 to 22.
Norman and Elkington, the man who beat Colin Montgomerie in a play-off
for his first major title last month, team up with Craig Parry in a bid
to give Australia their third victory in the event, but their first
since 1986.
Zimbabwean Price will again have Mark McNulty and Tony Johnstone as
his team-mates, while Els joins David Frost and Retief Goosen for South
Africa.
America, surprisingly beaten by Canada in last year's final, have a
completely new line-up this time in Masters champion Crenshaw, Ryder Cup
team-mate Peter Jacobsen, and Lee Janzen, while the Canadians, not
surprisingly, have Dave Barr, Rick Gibson, and Ray Stewart back to the
defend the title.
The four home nations had already named their sides, with Nick Faldo
declining his invitation and being replaced by Barry Lane.
Other notables missing are Seve Ballesteros for Spain, Bernhard Langer
for Germany, and American pair Corey Pavin and John Daly, respectively
the US Open and Open champions.
The draw into four groups of four takes place on the eve of the event.

SCOTLAND'S auctioneers have added their voice to the concern being
expressed about the proposed introduction of a single retention period
under the Sheep Annual Premium scheme.
Willie Blair, president of the Institute of Auctioneers and
Appraisers, put his views forcefully at a meeting with Scottish Office
officials. ''We made very strong representations that the current
proposals would seriously distort the normal market pattern for sheep,''
he said.
''The effects would not only be felt in the spring but also at the
back end. A lot of people buy ewes in the autumn to sell as ewes with
lamb at foot -- but they are not going to keep them until May 14. If
they can't sell before that they won't buy them. That will have a
knock-on effect right along the chain through the whole sheep
industry.''
Mr Blair said that many ordinary sheep farmers had not yet wakened up
to the ramifications which would follow if the present two retention
periods -- ending on March 25 and May 31 -- were telescoped into one
period ending in about the middle of May.
''I don't think it has dawned on them at the top of the hill yet, but,
suddenly, they will be asking why they are getting a bad price and the
answer will be 'market forces'. The balance of the market is being
changed by political decisions.''
Mr Blair said that the ethnic communities in the UK were the biggest
consumers of ewe mutton and they could find their supplies being
seriously distorted. ''There will be none at one time and then the ewes
will all come out in the middle of May and they will be worth half of
nothing.''
The entire industry was speaking with once voice on the issue, he
added. The Livestock Auctioneers Association in England and Wales had
given a similar response.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland has already made direct
representations to Scottish Office Agriculture Minister Lord Lindsay.
Richard Henton, livestock commodities director, said the union was
absolutely against the proposals. If there had to be a change, he said,
it should not be implemented before 1997 at the earliest so producers
could have time to prepare for it.
The average farmer had not taken on board the implications but the
union had done so and had fought the issue from the beginning, he said.
The proposal for a move to a single retention system is a response to
criticisms from the EU that the present double retention period could be
open to fraud. That would occur if an animal on which premium had
already been paid was sold in time for the new owner to claim payment
during the second period.
There is no evidence that double payments occur on any significant
scale but the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund has
expressed unease that the UK system does not effectively control the
risk of double payment.
A consultation paper on the proposed changes was issued during the
summer and responses should be lodged with the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department, Room 236, Pentland House, 47
Robb's Loan, Edinburgh, by next Tuesday.
The National Sheep Association has issued the entire consultation
paper to all its members. Chairman John Briggs described the proposals
as forming one of the most serious legislative issues to confront the
industry for some time.

THE Andre Agassi juggernaut and the Monica Seles comeback express
chugged into the US Open quarter-finals on a day of little drama at
Flushing Meadow yesterday.
Top seed and defending champion Agassi ran his summer hardcourt
winning streak to a personal-best 24 with a routine 7-5, 6-3, 6-2
victory over fellow American Jared Palmer.
Seles faced her toughest opposition since her return to big-time
tennis last month from hard-hitting German Anke Huber, the No.11 seed.
But the 21-year-old superstar dropped just five games en route to a
6-1, 6-4 victory as things settled back to business as usual after
Sunday's upset of women's defending champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario by
Mary Joe Fernandez.
World No.1 Agassi took an hour and 48 minutes to defeat Palmer, and
now looks on course for a semi-final with Boris Becker in what would be
a rematch of this year's Wimbledon last-four clash, won by the German.
Fourth-seed Becker, the 1989 Open champion but a first-round loser
last year, played giant killer to reach the quarter-finals.
Becker never faltered from the service line in pounding out a 7-6,
6-3, 6-3 victory over towering No.13 seed Marc Rosset of Switzerland.
Agassi will play former French Open runner-up Petr Korda in the
quarter-finals. Korda, of the Czech Republic, advanced with a 6-2, 7-5,
6-4 victory over American Vince Spadea.
Second-seed Seles will now meet veteran Czech serve and volleyer, Jana
Novotna, who closed out unseeded Slovakian Katarina Studenikova 6-4, 6-3
to earn her shot at the 1991 and 1992 US Open champion.
The day produced one minor surprise when No.16 seed Dutchwoman Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy used her big serve and volley game to pick off seventh
seed Kimiko Date of Japan 7-5, 3-6, 6-2.

CASTROL is one of Britain's most successful international brand names
which is known throughout the world and Burmah Castrol is making quite a
good job of exploiting it.
The market for lubricating oils by volume is static as, although the
world car population is expanding, the amount of oil they need during
their life is becoming less as the quality of oils and efficiency of
engines improve.
Burmah is not expecting much increase in volume until the turn of the
century. But the search for more effective lubrication continues.
The best growth area is inevitably the Asia-Pacific region. Helped by
historic links, Burmah already has 15% of the Indian market and is
market leader in Malaysia with 25%. Gaining a bigger shares in these
countries will be more difficult. But the market itself is growing fast.
There is everything to go for in other countries in the area.
Burmah is moving into the Philippines, Vietnam and China. Already
Burmah has a dominant share in Vietnam for quality oils, though cheap
low-quality local products still have the larger share.
The potential of the region is enormous as rapid economic development
takes place which will bring rising car populations for the foreseeable
future. Asia Pacific currently accounts for under a third of Castrol
sales but group chief executive Jonathan Fry can already see the day
when it will be the largest component.
Castrol's trading profits grew by 9% to #94.3m in the first half of
the year, helping group pre-tax profits to a 13% gain to #117m. The
interim dividend is raised by a tenth to 11p and shareholders can look
forward again to a foreign income dividend with the final, making a
probable total for the year of some 35p.
In Europe, Castrol achieved a strong result despite continuing
sluggish demand from the consumer sector. The industrial side has been
buoyant for some time as economies and exports have picked up. For the
first time in three years the company is starting to see an upturn at
the consumer end but is uncertain whether this will continue.
In North America consumer markets have turned softer and profits were
down compared with a buoyant equivalent period.
Burmah's chemicals division, Foseco, took time to get moving following
its acquisition in 1991 but its results took off last year and the trend
is continuing, with profits up 36% to #30m.
Foseco was technically strong but needed better production management
and marketing which Burmah is supplying. It has ultimately turned out to
be a good acquisition. Some #20m of costs were taken out of the
business, largely through rationalising factories in Europe.
Burmah sold its petrol stations recently to Frost Group, the largest
independent fuel retailer, and there was some disagreement between
vendor and buyer over who got the best deal.
Frost Group reckoned the price was something of a steal whereas Burmah
reckons it got a good price, which will eventually amount to some #90m
compared with the initial #83m handover. Anyway its profits were down in
the first half of the year and it operates in a highly-competitive
market so Burmah is probably well shot of it. Frost has the advantage of
scale.
The reduction in interest charges on its debt will be worth more than
the business's contribution would have been in the second half. Gearing
should be down to about 40% come the year-end.
It wouldn't be a bad idea for Burmah to ditch its shipping business,
or what remains of it, either, as it generates a modest return. But it
will not be the Achilles heel that it might have been. Contracts on the
eight liquefied natural gas carriers were expiring and there were doubts
over their renewal. In the event, however, this has been obtained for
six and the other two are expecting to follow likewise. Profits dipped
9% to #2.9m.
Burmah as a whole is inching its profit margin forward and it now
stands at 8%. Mr Fry is confident it will reach 10% if not next year, in
1997.
This underwrites profits growth for the next couple of years as
overall demand should be static at worst. With the first-half trends
continuing, 1995 profits should be around #246m against #220m excluding
exceptionals, leaving the shares, up 16p at 970p and selling at about 15
times likely earnings and yielding over 4%, a firm hold.

THE FESTIVAL
Sara Villiers found that the altitudes of the high points more than
made up for the few depressions
WHIMSICALLY plotting my critical journey through the Festival theatre
programme as a graph of highs and lows I have created a mountain range
which certainly towers over my Fringe experience but which has a few
troughs none the less, though thankfully no sloughs of despond.
If, against my fevered anticipations, it occasionally felt like a slog
-- the first production, Lanark, proved disheartening and the Berliner
Ensemble's production of The Merchant of Venice blazed only briefly --
then the altitudes of the high points more than compensated for the
depressions of the lows. The finely channelled emotional energy of Don
Carlos sucked my breath away, while Dans la Solitude des Champs de Coton
made me dizzy with excitement.
Ultimately, the wondrous moments stay with you while, thankfully, the
memories of the disappointments quickly fade and on reflection it was a
commendable programme of diverse and popular appeal.
Less adventurous than in previous years, it was certainly more
audience-friendly, with its range of English-speaking productions and
easily accessible foreign humour, from the madcap antics of Deschamps et
Deschamps' C'est Magnifique to Berlin's Schaubuhne Am Lehniner Platz's
translations of the elegant French social comedies of Sacha Guitry, The
Illusionist and Let's Dream.
It boasted world-class directors familiar to Festival audiences, Peter
Zadek and Luc Bondy, while introducing Patrice Chereau, still described
as Europe's enfant terrible despite his grizzled appearance, to
Edinburgh. Now we're clamouring for his return. Dans La Solitude . . .
was potentially the riskiest Festival venture -- playwright
Bernard-Marie Koltes, who died of Aids in 1989 aged 41, might be
acclaimed in France but his work is virtually unknown here and the play
itself had only ever been staged once before -- but it proved a stunning
success despite the uninformed and preposterous cavils of some English
critics. They spent the intensely visual experience of the highly
physical performance scanning an English translation of the script which
had been sent out weeks in advance.
McMaster's inclusion of this Odeeo-Theatre de L'Europe production was
perhaps his finest Festival theatre achievement, focusing as it did an
attention on Koltes which will hopefully result in future presentations
of his work in this country.
And, despite my serious misgivings over Lanark, which is now embarking
on an extensive tour of Scotland, the inclusion of TAG was also
commendable, McMaster offering support of a Scottish company which has
produced sterling work for years and which packed audiences in during
its previous Festival foray in 1993, with A Scots Quair. I just wish
they had chosen something more original than yet another adaptation to
showcase their skills.
Much of the programme was tried and tested. Dublin's Abbey Theatre had
had a huge hit last year on home turf with director Patrick Mason's
revival of Frank McGuinness's Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Toward
the Somme. McMaster had set himself up for some flak in inviting a
company who had visited the Festival only last year (with Synge's The
Well of the Saints) but the force of this movingly acted and simply but
strikingly designed production conquered all.
In a fine example of ensemble acting by nine men, Conor McDermottroe
was particularly memorable as Craig facing up to the carnage of the
Somme with compassion and courage. Just as they bravely enter battle so
the company were unruffled by the disruption of not one but two fire
alarms which interrupted a performance, triggered by the stultifying
heat wave and decanting the audience on to the street twice. The actors'
unflappability, plunging back into the deeply-felt action, was
recognised and rewarded with a Herald Little Devil award for so
admirably overcoming adversity.
Director Peter Zadek's production of The Merchant of Venice was also a
previously acclaimed success, in its debut incarnation in Venice in
1988. Its setting of the merchants' wheelings and dealings on the Rialto
in a contemporaneous, yuppified money-making arena is one which has been
much emulated since and the production, which posits Shylock as a
merchant no more mercenary than any other, had many intriguing elements
and boasted a powerful opening act, but its central dynamics fizzed out
throughout the evening.
Awaited with near-bated breath, as it was the same team who had
brought last year's sensational Antony and Cleopatra, it proved to be
insubstantial. A great disappointment, to me at least, Zadek's
interpretation was certainly applauded elsewhere. However, I couldn't
get over the irritation of exceptionally weak performances by the women,
in particular Eva Mattes. Practically revered in Germany, she came
across as a stoney-faced, wooden Portia, although the inadequacies of
her performance were certainly compensated for by the brilliant Gert
Voss as Shylock.
Voss triggered the biggest guessing game of the Festival when,
post-Merchant, he was stricken with a serious throat infection which put
him in hospital. Would he or wouldn't he make his next scheduled
appearance in the first of the Guitry double-bill, directed by Luc
Bondy, The Illusionist? At a Festival press conference McMaster
announced, with regret, that the first performance was cancelled. How we
groaned with disappointment. How we cheered when less than an hour later
McMaster dramatically informed us that the show would go on after all.
Voss's fortitude was admirable, although our excitment was somewhat
misplaced as The Illusionist and Let's Dream, while both perfectly
produced and wittily acted, were very slight pieces, Guitry's social
observation lacking the bite and sassiness of Coward. Charming but
incapable of creating any frisson.
There were thrills in abundance during the earlier production of Don
Carlos, a powerhouse production which united the talents of the
Citizens' triumvirate, with Robert David MacDonald translating the
Schiller play, Philip Prowse directing and designing, and Giles Havergal
playing King Philip II of Spain with majestic gravitas.
It was a remarkable, intensely theatrical achievement which, like the
exhilarating Dans la Solitude des Champs des Coton, was awarded a Herald
Angel. This was excellence indeed.

THE narrow measure of the money supply, M0, which covers notes and
coins in circulation and bankers' balances, rose by 0.7% last month,
taking the annual rate of growth up from 5.8% to 6.1%.
It was the first time that the year-on-year rate was above 6% since
April, but the monthly increase was lower than the City had expected.
The apparent weakness was in the notes and coins element, but
economists at City stockbroker James Capel said the figures were
consistent with robust spending in the High Street.
Notes and coins increased by just 0.5%, and the annual rate edged down
from 6.2% in July to 5.9%. The three-month annualised rate fell sharply
from 7% to 5.3%.
The annual growth in M0 continues to exceed the 0% to 4% monitoring
range, but the figures will make no impact on the conduct of monetary
policy.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, meet on Thursday to review interest
rates, which were last raised in February.
Most of the data on the real economy and inflation over the last month
suggests that there will be no change in rates.
The Chancellor has been resisting calls from Mr George for higher
rates since May. There is speculation that the Governor will now change
his tune and fall into line with Mr Clarke's policy of holding rates
steady. A rebound in sterling since the last meeting in July has
weakened the Bank's case.
The relationship between notes and coins and retail sales is tentative
at best. The lower-interest-rate environment has reduced the penalties
of holding cash and there is also evidence that spending on leisure
activities is growing faster than retail sales.
Trading in the High Street has been lacklustre since last autumn, but
there were signs of a pick up in the latest two months for which figures
are available. In both June and July the volume of sales grew by 0.4%,
suggesting that the consumer may be coming back to life.

ROBBIE Dinwoodie, your Scottish political correspondent, has found
that the Government's private finance initiative is proving
controversial as a solution to the need for investment in the water
industry.
Build-own-operate schemes are becoming the Government's answer to any
need for public investment, although they are a more expensive option
for the taxpayer. Most recently in the consultation document on pre-five
education, this initiative is Michael Forsyth's preferred and only
suggestion for capital investment.
So far local authorities may not have had time to think through what
this may imply. The so-called ''BOO'' schemes will be more costly in the
long term and are a means of generating extra profits for private
capital at public expense.

MR David Howell MP thinks that British foreign policy is too
submissive. As he is the Chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select
Committee we should pay attention to what he says, although we need not
agree with all of it. Mr Howell wants our interests as a nation to be
redefined with the sharpest-edged clarity. He complains of many things,
not least the way in which we appear to have backed American policy in
former Yugoslavia with alacrity and uncritically. Mr Howell argues with
some truth that the American analysis of the issues is simplistic and
likely to be confounded in the end by the Serbs. He is probably correct,
although his belief that arming the Bosnian Government forces would be
the quickest way to end the killing is the purest Thatcherism and,
incidentally, close to the view of many Americans. Mr Howell chides the
policy of participating in the UN Conference on Women in Beijing. This
hardly seems such a terrible act and he acknowledges that attendance may
be necessary, but again he is unhappy with our readiness to participate.
He sees a danger that we might be uncritical or tempted into the
position of condoning some of the conference conclusions which he fears
might be deeply disturbing or negative. Again, he may have a point.
There is a dim-witted business about many foreign policy events which
makes them redundant before they have started. A participant in the
Beijing conference said yesterday that women had been ''conferenced to
death'' and Kant put it more elegantly when he said that ''bustling
folly is the character of our species''.
We get closer to Mr Howell's real meaning when he complains about our
readiness to appease Russia over the issue of future members of Nato and
says that our true and best friends are the new democracies of Eastern
and Central Europe. Those of us who thought that our essential interests
might coincide with our membership of the European Union are clearly
wrong, for the EU is also the subject of an attack by Mr Howell. Britain
is in the super league as a global investor, he insists, and of all
Britain's assets abroad only some 21% of them are accounted for by the
EU. Why, then, is policy so dominated by the EU? On this analysis our
whole policy approach to the EU and to our bilateral relations with
France and Germany has been too defensive. In this, Mr Howell is
probably correct, but he fails to give the real reason for it. It is not
because our foreign policy is reticent or defeatist as he appears to
believe, but because the entire issue of our relations with the EU has
been hamstrung, haltered, and rendered ridculous by the open warfare on
Europe within Mr Howell's own party.
Against most available evidence Mr Howell believes that the electorate
is interested in foreign policy. More importantly, he believes that a
strong and confident foreign policy is vital in winning another term in
government for the Tories. And here we have it; British foreign policy
must change, not for reasons of national pride or success, but because
the political fortunes of the Tories depend on it. This is not good
enough but at least Mr Howell is honest. He is also correct in part.  It
is too easy to say that Britain is small and weak and really has little
clout left. This may, or may not, be true but it does not stop us from
debating international issues with confidence or from coming to our own
conclusions and sticking to them. The problem is that, as former
diplomat and now discontented Tory MP, Mr George Walden, wrote in a book
many years ago, ''There is a self-evident link between the 'temperament'
of a people and its foreign policy''. Mr Howell's analysis raises
interesting points, some of which are true, but it is in itself
simplistic and quite devoid of any notion of culpability, other than
that due to the perceived enemy in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

IT was Michael Forsyth himself who pointed out the contradiction at
the Stirling premiere of Braveheart. There was Mel Gibson, perhaps the
most popular man in all of Scotland this week, being shadowed by a huge
security chap.
There was the Scottish Secretary, not the most popular man in Scotland
this or any week, sans bodyguard.
Also odd was the kilt count adorning the body politic. Forsyth alone
favoured the tartan while Alex Salmond of the SNP, Labour's George
Robertson, and Charles Kennedy of the Lib-Dems stuck to sober dinner
suits.
Another irony was the absence from the premiere of the Scots Lib-Dem
leader Jim Wallace. And him being perfectly positioned to bask in the
reflected glory of his ancestor William.
One political Wallace in attendance was Anne of that ilk, convener of
Central Regional Council and a likely candidate to confront Michael
Forsyth in the Stirling seat at the next General Election. We can
confirm that Ms Wallace is an extremely honest politician.
She was wearing the convener's gold chain which becomes redundant next
April. She turned down our offer for the chain to be ''misplaced'' and
the proceeds split two ways.
* The Diary had a relatively unsuccessful night star-spotting at the
Braveheart party in Stirling Castle. Mel Gibson himself was submerged in
a crowd of people all taller than him. ''That's his thumb. That's Mel's
thumb,'' pointed out Ms Jackie Westbrook of the MacRobert Centre, who
helped organise the premiere and who should know.
We are also grateful to Siobhan Sinnott, the Radio Scotland
reporterette, for the information that Mariella (Frostrup) and Patsy
(Kensit) had been holding hands. Siobhan also pointed out Caroline
Paterson, the Scottish starlet in EastEnders. ''Who?'' we asked. ''The
one who plays Ruth who is married to Mark who is currently having his
sperm washed because he is HIV positive and Ruth wants to have a baby,''
Siobhan replied.
With her detailed knowledge of matters showbiz allied to her sheer
talent, it is hardly surprising that Ms Sinnott was chosen by the BBC to
interview Mel Gibson. The envy of her female colleagues was heightened
when she admitted that she didn't really find Mr Gibson all that
attractive.
Star of the night, in the Diary's opinion, was the aspiring young lady
film-maker who shall remain nameless and who had gatecrashed the
glittering Hollywood-comes-to-Stirling event by simply having a laser
colour photocopy made of a friend's invitation.
* For many people, the Braveheart experience is a deeply emotional
one. The Diary found one of the Wallace Clan, the warrior-like ones with
the blue-and-white faces, crying in the gents toilet. Was it all too
much for him, we asked? ''No, it's this blue stuff. It's murder if it
gets in your eyes.''
Hot air
NOT entirely politic but very much to the point is the column which
George Foulkes, Labour MP for a South Ayrshire constituency with a Very
Long Name, wrote last week for the Ayrshire Post. ''The biggest balloon
of this topsy turvy week must be SRUC secretary Campbell Christie,'' he
wrote.
Foulksie's beef was that Campbell Christie had been seen to be
fraternising with the enemy, aka Michael Forsyth, in a news conference
after a meeting between the STUC and the Scottish Secretary. This at a
time when, said Foulksie, the Tory Government continued to press on with
its nasty policies on devolution, water, rail, electricity, unemployment
and sending unmarried mums up chimneys.
''It's easily seen how some of these union bosses get out of touch
with feeling at the grass roots.'' We take it a spot of afternoon tea is
out of the question between George and Campbell at the next Labour Party
conference.
Health warning
MUCH publicity has attended the Business Age magazine's list of
Britain's top 500 filthy rich people. On a purely personal note, we were
more interested in the subset of the 10 most eligible single women.
Heading the list of these wealthy girlies is Lady Jane Willoughby de
Eresby, aged 61, with #185m in disposable income. Business Age described
Lady Jane, perhaps a touch ungallantly, as ''one of the oldest titles in
the country. Owns enormous estates''.
We feel that our sheer devotion to the product over the years should
count with heiresses numbers three and four in the list, the ladies
Louisa and Emma Guinness, 24 and 32 respectively, and each with #73m in
the kitty.
Or try your luck with Littlewoods pools scioness Donatella Moores, 33,
in at number five on the list with #52m at her disposal, although it is
pointed out that the inroads of the National Lottery into pools profits
may not make her a good long-term bet.
There is a hint of lese-majesty at number eight as HRH Princess
Margaret, aged 63, with a personal fortune of #43m is cited as being
available but with the warning: ''High liver. Difficult family.''
Attention in class
WE mentioned in passing that the Gaelic word for orgasm was
fraoch-feirge which translates literally as heather-rage. Tom Donnelly
of Partickhill Road, Glasgow, writes to suggest a more appropriate, if
bawdier, translation might be bush-fire.
Mr Donnelly adds: ''Years ago a Lewisman friend regaled me with the
Gaelic words for various stages of the male erection. I was surprised at
the large number.
''This could be a rich vein for sexual anthropologists but,'' he
concludes, ''For me, now, the whole business is purely academic.''
Game for a laugh
THE description of Glasgow artist John Shankie's new work at the
city's Tramway struck a chord with the Diary. His is ''an obsessive
world of domestic disharmony'' where ''Frozen clothes preserved in
industrial freezers, absorb cookers made from twisted elements and
ritualistic videos of banal domestic incidents populate the space.'' But
that's not the bit that rings the bell with us chaps. It's where Mr
Shankie says: ''Some of the work is very personal while other objects
are drawn from half-remembered jokes and anecdotes.''

A WELCOME boost of #120,000 of European funding has helped to ensure
that long-term unemployed people on a multi-funded two-year pilot
project in Glasgow will have a better chance of finding jobs when they
have completed their training and personal development programme.
Glasgow Works, which started in 1994, received the funding through the
Employment Horizon programme as part of a trans-national bid by a number
of European ''partners'' in Genk, Dortmund, Belfast, Eindhoven, Athens
and Glasgow, all concerned with helping long-term unemployed people back
into the workplace.
The money has been earmarked for the project's central jobsearch
service, which aims to identify and target employment opportunities for
those coming to the end of Glasgow Works.
''Other projects in Europe are looking at different ways of tackling
this problem,'' explained Ken Wardrop of Glasgow Development Agency.
''We started to talk to a number of other European organisations about
their experiences and felt there was enough in common for it to be worth
putting together a formal partnership to see what lessons/experiences
could be shared. That was the basis of the application to Employment
Horizon.''
By any standard, Glasgow has serious long-term unemployment. One
quarter of the population of Scotland lives in the Glasgow connurbation.
The area also has a quarter of the Scottish long-term unemployed.
The major problem with long-term unemployment is that the longer
people are out of work the more difficult it is to get them back into
full-time employment. People in these circumstances lose touch with the
job market, their confidence and skills are diminished, and they become
less familiar with information networks.
Glasgow Works is led by Glasgow Development Agency and supported by
Glasgow Development Agency (GDA), Scottish Enterprise, the Employment
Service, Strathclyde Regional Council and Glasgow City Council, STUC,
and various public and private companies. A major part of the #3.75m
budget comes comes from the European Social Fund.
''We pulled together a package of training and personal development
that we thought would be effective not just in getting people into a
programme but making them employable at the other end,'' said Ken
Wardrop.
''It starts with a two to four-week period of intensive assessment and
guidance followed by a competitive interview for recruitment to Glasgow
Works itself.''
This is a pilot programme of 19 projects and there are 250 places
available per year to people in Glasgow who have been unemployed for
over 12 months.
The programme is a package of work training and personal development,
with three days a week working for a project at the rate for the job,
one day college-based training related to the work and leading to a
vocational qualification, and a day devoted to individually determined
personal development.
Initially each project was responsible for its own job search but the
recent addition of a centralised job search service for all 19 different
Glasgow Works projects means that the participants have a much greater
chance of finding suitable employment.
The projects include after school childcare, youth work, ''buddying''
homeless people, helping disabled people to find work, manufacturing,
management and various health-related projects. Outwith Glasgow Works,
most of the projects would not happen.
The common theme to them all is that they are important to Glasgow,
both economically and environmentally. They are designed to improve the
quality of life in the city and to promote the health of Glasgow,
Glasgow as a child--friendly city and a centre of cultural heritage.
When the initial specifications were drawn up, local economic
development companies, charitable organisations and training forums were
all approached and invited to submit project ideas, bearing in mind that
the programme stresses the importance employers place on transferrable
skills.
According to Ken Wardrop, those coming through the Glasgow Works
project have exceptional qualities to offer employers.
''They have had recent work experience, communicating and working in a
team,'' he said. ''They are adaptable, good at problem solving, used to
training, have worked with recent technology and have learned new
experiences through their own personal development. All of these skills
have enhanced their employability.''
By the end of the pilot period, around 500 people will have
participated in Glasgow Works. Of the 100 people who have already
finished their year, almost half are already in full-time employment and
two have gone onto further education.
Mary Taylor is just one success story. She chose to work in a caring
area since she had previously done street work.
After a two-year illness, she found herself out of work and bereft of
any confidence. She applied for the City Station project in Glasgow
Works where she learned to advise homeless people on welfare, first aid,
housing, health -- every issue of concern to homeless people.
''The project drew out the skills I already had but had lost,'' she
said. ''It gave me the confidence to go after other jobs. City Station
definitely worked. We had a good manager who made us into a good team.''
Within seven months of starting on the project, Mary found a full
time, long-term job. Today she is the deputy outreach manager for the
Big Issue, managing offices in Edinburgh, Glenrothes, Dundee and
Aberdeen.
Monitoring the progress of people like Mary should help to encourage
the funders to look at the long term future of Glasgow Works beyond the
pilot phase.
An interim evaluation is being carried out at the present time and if
it proves successful not only in terms of jobs but in value for money,
the findings will be submitted to Brussels to argue for long-term
security of funding from Europe.

OLD soldiers never die and hacks rarely rest. Ever a subscriber to the
''busman's holiday'' school of philosophy, I recently enrolled for the
playwriting course run by the dramatist and actor Colin Mortimer as part
of Edinburgh University's International Summer Schools programme.
''We shall explore together what a play is,'' he explained, ''how it
is structured, how it is driven by the wants and emotions of the
characters.
''It will be a practical course -- I want to encourage you to develop
your writing.''
The students, from all corners of the globe and ranging in age from 18
to a sprightly 71, were not required to have previous experience of
creative writing for the one-week full-time course, though masochism and
limitless energy were desirable qualities. Plays, whether on stage,
television or film, must reflect conflicts, Colin Mortimer asserted, and
these conflicts in turn reflect the internal aspirations of characters.
In writing, you place the characters together and see where their wants
take them. To the loony bin in the case of Basil Fawlty, I remember
thinking at the time.
The conflicts are battles in which ascendancy will shift along the
way. Before the play reaches its major climax near the end, there will
have been a series of mini-climaxes and reversals of fortune which
ensure that, by not proceeding in a monotonous straight line, the play
builds up both interest and tension. Unless you're watching Neighbours,
of course.
Colin Mortimer likened the structure of the play to a skeleton. The
flesh is the things that happen, while the dialogue -- the external
manifestation of the wants and emotions of the characters -- is the
clothes.
To understand structure, we analysed a film and video, admittedly of
very different genres. Supremely confident in the wisdom that comes from
never having had to make a film, we concluded that the Disney production
of Jungle Book was a less-than-perfect example of structure since
certain characters -- especially the elephant patrol and the vultures --
were not introduced as a natural consequence of the action and did not
contribute to its development.
On the other hand, Arthur Miller will be gratified to know that his
powerful drama All My Sons, dealing with searing moral conflicts in an
American family, entirely survived our critical gaze. It contained the
classical elements of structure -- unity, climaxes and setbacks which
heightened the conflict; suspense created by Miller's masterly ability
to release vital pieces of information to the audience at critical
moments; and a convincing climax and resolution (the father's
acknowledgment of his long-hidden guilt in sending young airmen to their
deaths in faulty aircraft, and his subsequent suicide).
''Forget the idea of writing for yourself,'' Colin Mortimer advised,
consigning all our fond thoughts of Monty Python-type self-indulgence to
the wastebasket. ''Think about the audience and its reaction.
Theatregoers want to be involved, affected, shocked.''
Apart from sitting in on a rehearsal by the theatre company
Communicado of a play by the South African writer Athol Fugard, we
attended four plays in Edinburgh -- Stanley Eveling's Dear Janet
Rosenberg, Dear Mr Kooning, Noel Coward's Private Lives and a rare
revival of his Cavalcade -- not rare enough, in my opinion -- and the
world premiere of The Reader by the Chilean Ariel Dorfman.
We also had an illuminating visit from Audrey Evans, a retired teacher
who used her experience at the chalkface at Kirkcaldy High School to
write a short story, Miss Mossy, which was broadcast by the BBC, and
then to transform it into a half-hour play performed on BBC Radio 4.
Being about a teacher who, on her last day, becomes emotionally caught
up for the first time in the dilemma of a boy with a cruel father, it
reminded me that there is no hiding-place from education, even over the
summer.
With the theory came the practice. We undertook several pieces of
imaginative writing, including a scenario based on a fairy tale (I did a
rambling and undisciplined version of Cinderella, with guest appearances
at the ball from Charles, Diana and Camilla) and a 15-minute playlet
(mine was a re-working of the Stanley Eveling play, with Mr Kooning
mouthing Rab C. Nesbitt monologues which nobody could fathom).
Over the last three days we worked individually with Colin Mortimer
and two professional actors, Martha Leishman -- who was starring in Dear
Janet Rosenberg, Dear Mr Kooning at the Traverse Theatre -- and Ian
Wotherspoon.
Our scripts were dissected, revised, rehearsed and, on the final day,
recorded so that we could take away a video of our work. (Sadly, mine is
unavailable, even to regular subscribers to The Herald, being covered by
the 30-year rule)). We had been fascinated to see how our writing was
interpreted and enriched by quality acting.
For teachers Elisabeth Pfisterer from Germany and Gunlog Nildin from
Sweden, interaction with the other students and learning about play
structure had been the highlights of a course they warmly commended. ''I
also came to understand about sub-text,'' said Elisabeth. ''In the
theatre what is said and what is meant are often very different.''
Roy Petrie, a retired engineer from Rochdale with experience of
amateur theatrical production, said: ''I knew the bits and pieces -- now
I understand how to fit them together.'' Allysa Hickman from the US,
''found the group analysis approach and individual discussions with the
tutor very rewarding''.
Colin Mortimer saw his own role as encouraging experimentation and
guiding students in the right direction. ''You can become a proficient
cyclist,'' he said, ''but you don't develop your full potential if the
seat of your cycle is facing the wrong way''.
Me? I love courses like this, where the lecturer doesn't lecture at
you and you come away longing for more. Until the idea for my first
stage masterpiece comes along, I'm going to practise by sprinkling my
pieces for Education Herald with mini-climaxes and reversals.

BUNZL, the international paper and plastics group, is less exposed to
the packaging cycle than some of its competitors. This, coupled with
improvements in its American operations, enabled profits to show a 52%
improvement to #50m in the six months to June 30, writes NICOLA REEVES.
A loss of #35m on the sale of discontinued operations contributed to
the loss of #2.2m in the first six months of 1994.
Sales in continuing businesses grew by 25% to #879.5m and the interim
dividend is raised by 11% to 2.0p, the first increase in the interim
payout for four years.
Although the company is encouraged by its trading prospects it does
not expect to repeat the increase in earnings reported in the first
half.
Chief executive Anthony Habgood said the outlook for its raw material
prices continued to be mixed, but the company has successfully passed on
higher input prices to its customers.
Price rises of up to 14% were made in the first half, but volumes
increased as economic growth continued around the globe and Bunzl gained
market share.
The paper and plastic disposables division, the group's largest, was
the star performer helped by strong US demand. Its sales rose 21% to
#491.9m with profits up 61% to #31.7m. The European paper and plastics
operation benefited from recent acquisitions.
Other divisions also performed strongly. Rising paper and pulp prices
added to higher volumes in the UK and Germany helped Fine Paper profits
to jump 53% to #10m.
Shares in Bunzl have slipped recently on fears of softening paper
prices and Rexam's recent profit warning. At 209p down half-a-penny,
Bunzl trades at a discount to the sector and looks undervalued.

IT was naive of the STUC delegation led by Campbell Christie to
welcome Michael Forsyth's assurance that water and sewerage
reorganisation would not lead to privatisation. If anything is
inevitable the new water quangos with their Tory toadies will ensure
privatisation by stealth.
Are certain people's memories so short that they cannot remember that
the current process of water reorganisation in Scotland happened in
England and Wales a few years ago? The result was privatised water with
water rates at least one-third higher than they are in Strathclyde
region.
It is inevitable that private finance will encroach increasingly
within water and sewerage services until a point will be reached where
all decisions relating to water will be based purely on the profit
motive.
I ask all the recently elected councillors of the new unitary councils
not to collect people's water bills for the West of Scotland Water Board
(a quango) on the basis that water and sewerage has been stolen from
local democratic control and that to collect water bills for this quango
would be doing its dirty work for them and would be a betrayal of the
one million people who voted against water being taken out of local
authority control in the water referendum.

NOT often but just frequently enough to make us feel in privileged
cohoots with a secret life, Miss Doran would appear before the Latin
class, inviting prayers for a special intention. And Upper Third would
stand behind its desks, smirkingly offering up the collective word to
the Holy Spirit to help Miss Doran back an Aintree winner. Do they make
teachers like this, nowadays? The question seeps into memory at this
time of year with the vision of all these dazzling new school uniforms
clustered round the bus stop.
Alas, one suspects, Miss Doran has gone the way of P G Wodehouse's
magnificently preposterous aunts. She was in her late fifties when we
entered her florid world and, according to the embroidered legends of
Old Girl reunions, there was a time when she was the belle of the
staffroom and could have won any man she chose. But Miss Doran was
over-choosy and, although never schoolmarmish, she belonged to that
generation of teachers who settled for a singular life rather than let
reality interfere with notions of passion.
On the whole divine inspiration paid off for her in betting matters.
When granted, Miss Doran's special intentions, always so urgent before
the Grand National, St Leger, and Cheltenham Gold Cup, would be
commemorated by a new blouse in bright contrast to the time-served
dinginess of her university gown. Suddenly Worth's Je Reviens would
scent her capable wrists and, for each of us, in celebration of her
triumph, there would be a Crunchie bar at the last classics lesson of
the week.
Miss Doran, then, had an existence beyond Petrarch, which seemed to us
mysterious and risky. As it happened our school seemed to specialise in
teachers whose unbridled individuality made them rich in anecdotal
value. Miss Doran's greatest staffroom chum was Miss Parry, whose
menopausal flushes caused her to conduct biology classes in mid-November
on a netball court. From Miss Parry we learned about sex, or rather on
her instructions we turned to page 42 of Jepson to find the Reproduction
of the Rabbit. ''That will give you the gist of the other thing,'' she
would say, slapping hankies soaked in cooling eau de cologne across her
forehead. And the smart ones among us guessed Miss Parry didn't really
know the ropes.
But Miss Donovan did. Miss Donovan was 28 and about to be married for
the second time. Before embracing history she had been an actress,
capitalising on the high-cheekboned fashion of the moment, and still
appearing now as the closest thing we would ever know to Audrey Hepburn.
Her first husband, a conjurer who could hypnotise a parrot, had
committed suicide by jumping off a balcony in Fulham. Now she was
marrying an Italian jeweller and going to live in Florence.
Miss D'Andria was Miss Donovan's fellow historian, two figures in
utter counterpoint. Where Donny was petite and gamine, Danny was as
gangly and swooping as a hockey stick, self-consciously hunched against
herself and moving so fast down the corridors she showered hairpins from
a makeshift bun. Improbably to us, she married a man, a geographer, more
handsome than Donny's Florentine fat cat, and in the wedding photographs
Danny's hairstyle beneath the veil was as hit-and-miss as ever, a large,
stray steel clip dangling down her brow beneath incongruous orange
blossom.
One day, in the spring term, Senorita Lopez Bermejo walked into our
lives, an emigre from Castro's Cuba but one who spoke the Spanish of a
Madrid aristocrat. Yet she had known Castro at university in Havana and
would say to us, eyes sparkling as if ready to cry: ''Ah, this Fidel, to
me he is like a brother. He has the beautiful dentures . . .''
Through all of this would trundle Miss Lawson, her face as wrinkled as
that of Auden, her lifelong poet hero. Where Miss Lawson walked a fine
spume of chalk dust followed. In repose she appeared like a landslide of
melancholy but when she smiled the creases lifted like a stage curtain
to reveal teeth just a little too goofy for sorrow. ''Remember girls,''
she would muse, ''it is the mad magenta moments that light the lavender
of life.''
One suspected Miss Lawson had always looked old, wrapped in clothes
which listed permanently to one side increasing her air of hard-earned
fatigue. She was the kindest, most patient, and illuminating teacher one
could ever encounter and, in her own way, a free-thinking warrior who,
without fuss, bequeathed three particular precepts to her pupils: take
nothing for granted; question everything; fight timidity of soul.

WHEN he was a professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University, the man
who is currently the Government's top adviser on science used to wave
his wife's nylon nightie at students. Professor John Cadogan, now
knighted and Sir John, would address classes of his freshest recruits
holding aloft first the nightie, then a sturdy plastic bucket of Our
Wullie proportions.
Then he would tell them: ''This is not the Space Age. This is not the
Computer Age. This is the age of chemistry. People may tell you
otherwise, but they are wrong.'' That was 18 years ago when Sir John was
at the height of his first career. Now he is on his third, being
Director-General of all Britain's research councils and standing in, for
a few months, as the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser.
He may well now have changed his mind about what age it is. The new
man who will be the Chief Scientific Adviser from September, Professor
Robert May, certainly has a different view. He believes we are on the
threshold of an ''age of biotechnology which will transform our lives as
radically as the industrial revolution did our ancestors''.
Genetic engineering will be the key to a new generation of
micro-machines -- such as plants genetically modified to grow medicines,
fuels and plastics instead of conventional crops. And all this will use
a fraction of the fossil fuels currently gobbled up by the West in its
search for better products.
Professor May said: ''In developed countries one calorie of food
requires 10 calories of fossil fuel to produce. In most of the rest of
the natural world a person has to spend less than one calorie to get one
calorie of food -- typically one-tenth of a calorie. This underlines the
degree of unsustainability of the fossil fuel age.''
Professor May, a mathematician expert in chaos theory who is Professor
of Zoology at Oxford University, will play a key role in shaping how
Britain will respond to the challenge of the twenty-first century global
economy which will become increasingly competitive. But it doesn't take
an egg-head to see some of the trends likely to affect researchers in
our academic institutions as Britain faces up to the challenges from
Pacific rim economies.
The Government has already copied the Japanese by instituting a body
called the Technology Foresight Steering Group to look at the whole of
Britain's economy and work out what areas we should aim to be world
leaders in. It canvassed views from 10,000 people and looked at all
aspects of the economy, not just the engineering and manufacturing
disciplines which might at first sight be most likely to benefit from
scientific breakthroughs. The main thrust was to get scientists and
business bosses working together so the country can turn its
intellectual strengths into profitable enterprises.
This ethos was strengthened when the Office of Science and Technology,
which Professor May will head, was moved from the Cabinet Office to the
Department of Trade and Industry in the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Those familiar leitmotifs of the future are appearing -- a shortage of
funds from traditional sources, partnerships with industry as an
alternative, efficiency drives and a decrease in job security for
workers. Aspiring academics, fresh from university with student debts
hanging over their heads, might like to fasten their seat belts now.
Professor May does not believe in jobs for life. ''I don't think
that's a good way to run the system, even though it did reasonably well
that way for years. These were different times,'' he said. ''A degree of
continuing appraisal and career development is good for everyone, and it
is good for the system that people realise their potential. The downside
is one doesn't run something well if everybody in it is continually
exposed to a sense of uncontrollable uncertainty.''
His vision is of middle-ranking scientists pursuing research on a
series of three-year contracts, with plum 10-year research fellowships
being reserved for the most promising high-fliers. There is evidence the
brightest and best are prepared to put up with this. Warwick University
was this year inundated with 10,000 enquiries and 2000 serious
applications when it launched a worldwide recruiting campaign, offering
six-year research fellowships. Thirty six have been appointed.
Back to Sir John Cadogan. He believes a shake-up of the jobs for life
privileges of academia is overdue. He recently reviewed the state of
British science and found that, although the country was a world leader
in many important areas, it had only ''islands of excellence'' in
several others, notably pure mathematics, software engineering,
atmospheric chemistry and epidemiology. He identified one problem facing
universities as the log-jam of lecturers appointed in the Sixties who
are clinging on to their jobs for life. He hinted that some were more
drained brains than brain-drain material and ought to go to let younger,
brighter, more innovative staff take their posts.
''They were appointed at a time of rapid growth of the universities
and are approaching retirement over the next decade or so. This can lead
to a lack of originality in some cases; more generally there needs to be
a steady flow of top quality staff into key research areas, otherwise
momentum is lost, originality declines and the capability to make a real
impact disappears.''
Sir John, of course, left his secure chair while in his late forties
to pursue a second successful career in industry with BP before joining
public service several years ago. Perhaps, in the future, academics,
like almost everyone else, will need to have diverse careers in order to
thrive.

IF Jackie Gordon excels at collating and imparting information, that's
her job. Not only is she a marketing assistant but the company she works
for specialises in information systems.
''I was always interested in computers and software,'' she says, ''but
I am always getting my eyes opened as to what can be done with them''.
She is beginning to talk like the sales specialist she plans to
become. For she is employed by one of those fast-growing companies whose
secret lies in the willingness of everyone to work together. Her present
marketing duties are gradually being expanded into something bigger.
Jackie left Paisley's Gleniffer High School five years ago with a
clutch of Highers -- Maths, English, Physics, Religious Studies, Modern
Studies, and French -- along with an SYS in French. She went to
Strathclyde University to study arts and social studies, with a heavy
emphasis on French, but disliked the over-concentration on seventeenth
and eighteenth-century French literature and left after a year.
Next she went to Glasgow Polytechnic, now Caledonian University, and
did a BA Honours in Business Studies with Marketing. That took four
years including a year's placement with the Glasgow Development Agency,
and she finished there in June this year.
Her graduation ceremony takes place this November and she is entitled
to enjoy it: The course, she says, was not too bad until she hit the
final year which, until the very time she embarked upon it, had been
spread over a year and a term. She had to do it in a year but says
future students are to be given a bit more time to do their final
dissertation.
Meanwhile she had been sponsored by Atlantic Information Systems, for
whom she had been working one day per week. She also spent her summer
working there so she was pretty well acquainted with it by the time she
took a full-time job there on leaving university.
Her connection with the company went back to its earliest days, when
it was set up in June 94 to provide business accounting software to
companies of all sizes.
At first it was a two-person concern, then it moved to offices in
Govan in July, and on to much more extensive premises in the West of
Scotland Science Park last September.
It now has a staff of 14 and aims to add a further 11 over the next
three years.
Jackie Gordon is meanwhile marketing assistant, involved in
exhibitions and sales, and acting as liaison person with the firm's
public-relations advisers.
The company is a member of the Chamber of Commerce and she is involved
in networking, attending conferences and events, and in the breakfast
sessions which take place regularly at Atlantic where prospective
customers are given brief demonstrations of the company's products.
Most of her time is spent on mail shots, attracting new customers,
follow-ups, and tele-sales. She enjoys her job, dealing with people, and
talking about the products. ''It's quite impressive what can be done,''
she says. She's going to do well in sales.

THE merged nuclear electricity generators are to be called British
Energy and headquartered in Edinburgh. That sounds fine enough, but the
head office has room for about 50 employees only, giving rise to the
fear that it will be a letter-plate office rather than the centre of
strategic planning and decision taking. The SNP were quick off the mark
to claim that the merger was ''a bad thing in the long run'' because it
lost the Scottish company's independence and its headquarters could be
moved at some future date. There is, of course, no necessary reason for
such a move. The day is passing when London's magnetism is proving
irresistible to the top managements of big enterprises. Locational costs
alone are not vital here (though London's very high costs are a
consideration which big companies no longer disregard), but the
telecommunications revolution is bound to make for geographical
dispersal once its full impact is culturally absorbed. It will certainly
not be on grounds of efficiency or arguments about proximity to markets,
that any move by British Energy from Edinburgh could be justified.
Future Westminster administrations will have to consider the very facts
which led the present Government to opt for Edinburgh this time. It is
hard to see them coming to different conclusions, for they were
political rather than industrial or administrative conclusions, though
they had no adverse industrial or administrative consequences.
On the other hand, the united nuclear companies are to be privatised,
and that may make all the difference. Unless the Government intends to
hold on to golden shares in perpetuity, privatisation, as most recently
defined by Mr Lang in this context means what it says, and allows the
market to decide on matters of ownership, except in most unusual
circumstances when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would no doubt
still be involved (and it more certainly would be in the case of a
Labour Government). If fact the whole electricity industry is in flux
with the present three bids for English regional electricity suppliers
being seen as merely the start of a trend which could involve at least
half their number. The activity need not be confined to the suppliers
for neither the giant English generators nor the two Scottish hybrid
companies must prove immune from attention, though size may protect
ScottishPower somewhat if it is augmented by success at Manweb (though
size did not save Eastern from Hanson).
ScottishPower's AGM in GLasgow yesterday provided little opposition to
its expansionist plans. The bid for Manweb has certainly sparked an
enthusiastic response among shareholders and an even wider Scottish
constituency. The Manweb line that it is ''a mean bid'' does grate on
Scottish nerves, as it is no doubt meant to, but the share price
movements suggests that the bid is not really far out. ScottishPower did
not rule out the possibility of an increase yesterday -- and it might
not need to be much to prove the clincher -- but until Manweb discloses
its variation on the Northern defence, which unlocked at least #5 of
value per share for existing holders, this battle looks to be
inconclusive. Nevertheless the timescale looks like being weeks rather
than months, and by then other bids for other electricity companies may
have been launched.

SCORES of teenagers were treated for hypothermia and drug-induced
paranoia at a 20-hour rave at Ingliston near Edinburgh at the weekend.
Three were taken to hospital and a further 261 were treated on the
spot by medics during the all-night event, which began at midday on
Saturday and attracted 11,000 frozen youngsters from all over Scotland
and the North of England.
Police yesterday expressed concern at the length of the event -- one
of the longest ever held at Ingliston, a regular rave venue since 1991.
Most previous raves had lasted only 12 hours. The next is due to take
place in the new year.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders police said: ''We have always had
good relations with the organisers of rave events. We are, however,
concerned that because of the duration of this particular event there
were some problems. It is something we will keep in mind for the
future.''
Between 80 and 100 officers were involved in police security at the
event. A total of 63 people were detained under the Misuse of Drugs Act
and one was charged in connection with the supply of drugs.
A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said the torrential
rain and cold conditions had led to hypothermia attacks for many of the
teenagers, who were dancing both in the open air and within two tents
erected for the night.
Councillor Dickie Alexander, chairman of Edinburgh District Council's
licensing committee, which gave the go-ahead for the event, said he
would ask for a report.

THE Barmac (Brown and Root McDermott Fabricators) yard at Nigg and
Ardersier has won the #11m contract for the British Gas Armada field
jacket.
The contract will create an extra 250 jobs at the yard at its peak
next spring.
The award is one of the last major Armada contracts and brings the
current value of the contracts to more than #350m, with around #290m
going to UK companies.
Designing and constructing Armada will involve more than 2000 man
years of work at the main design and fabrication site and at the peak of
construction the project will employ 1500 people -- more than 1000 of
them in Scotland.
When Armada is operational it will generate around #6m a year of
business for companies in the North-east of Scotland.
The Armada jacket and topsides are due for installation in early 1997
and the first gas should be ready to flow in October 1997.

DETAILS published in The Herald of higher education courses on which
places are still available and which start this month or next provide an
invaluable service, particularly for those pupils whose qualifications
do not match up to the requirements set by their first and second-choice
institutions. Clearing gives them the opportunity to match their results
with available places.
The Herald publishes the information on an annual basis in August and
a look at this year's lists confirmed a trend which is in danger of
becoming perennial, namely that nearly all engineering courses have a
surfeit of places. Engineering continues to suffer from a poor image
among potential students and their parents. The result is that, aside
from high-demand courses such as aeronautical engineering, engineering
faculties have a fight on their hands to recruit students in sufficient
numbers.
The challenge is not so daunting as to threaten individual courses,
but it is a worry for institutions. The overall quality of undergraduate
they eventually attract must also be of concern, particularly since
their recruitment drives regularly extend into clearing.
Then there is the gender issue. Dr Maggie Pollock, a lecturer in
mechanical engineering at Glasgow University, estimates that young women
account for only between 5% and 10% of undergraduate recruits to the
engineering faculty. Glasgow, Scotland's biggest university in terms of
student numbers, will not be alone with these estimates. Dr Judy
Wilkinson, an engineering faculty colleague of Dr Pollock, suspects that
women do not study engineering because of the teaching of physics in
schools, the image of women engineers, and the profession's general
perception.
Higher physics is second only to maths as an entry requirement for
most engineering courses but girls account for only one-third of the
pupils taking the subject. Girls, it seems, are put off because boys
dominate the classroom and monopolise equipment.
The odds, then, seem unfairly stacked against engineering, which could
be bad news for our continued wellbeing. As engineers frequently point
out, we cannot do without them, since they create, and frequently
design, the world we live in. The point is reinforced in a subtle,
lively, and highly-effective way through a ground-breaking initiative
commissioned by Dr Pollock.
About six months ago she approached four advertising agencies to
produce a campaign with the goal of altering the perceptions of young
people -- particularly girls -- and their families about what
engineering is about. ''Engineering has a dirty image, particularly in
the West of Scotland with its tradition of heavy engineering.
''Everybody on the shop floor is an engineer. The dustman is a
sanitary engineer, the mechanic an automative engineer. What
professional engineering is about has been lost sight of. Good students
who would be good in engineering tend to go for medicine, law, and
accountancy because they see these as high-profile, high-earning
professions.
''Medicine at Glasgow gets something like 5000 applications for about
225 places. Why don't the thousands who don't get in think about
engineering? We would grab these students with open arms. I can't think
of anything more boring than accountancy. Engineering may not offer the
same kind of money but it will certainly offer an interesting and
creative career,'' said Dr Pollock.
Scotland's 400-plus secondary schools are about to see the results of
the image-altering campaign. Glasgow design consultancy Scott Stern
Associates successfully tendered for the business and came up with what
Dr Pollock described as a ''completely new advertising campaign which
would put Glasgow University on the map for engineering''.
Each secondary will shortly receive a package containing five posters,
each with a striking image to reflect a different aspect of engineering
-- civil, electrical, aeronautical, mechanical engineering, and naval
architecture. Whether the image is of a yacht in stormy seas, a crop
growing in a desert, or a foetus captured on camera, the message is the
same -- the activity would have been impossible without engineering.
All five posters have photographs of young people's faces merged into
the images. To reflect the concern about righting the gender imbalance,
all but one of the posters -- and civil engineering is the exception --
show the faces of young women.
It is hoped that schools will display the posters prominently to
encourage fourth, fifth, and sixth-year pupils to fill in an application
form for the one which most takes their eye. The form also asks for
details of the subjects pupils are taking and, in addition to a poster,
they will also receive more information about the engineering faculty,
the oldest in Britain.
''I am not into the hard-sell approach. I'd rather encourage students
to think about coming here. If they are, we can invite them in to have a
look around,'' said Dr Pollock. ''This is a more subtle form of
advertising because you are getting Glasgow University on the student's
bedroom wall.''
She declined to discuss how much the campaign had cost, but pointed
out: ''It is no more expensive than advertising in half a dozen of those
magazines which keep pestering you every day for money. And it is a much
easier way of establishing if you are spending your money effectively.
If a student with a poster comes to Glasgow you can monitor that.''
Scott Stern director Simon MacQuarrie agrees. The company will be
represented at forthcoming Glasgow University open days -- which all
institutions organise to help young people and their families make up
their minds about what to study, and where -- to guage the impact of the
campaign.
He said: ''The university is a major centre for teaching and research
in engineering. The faculty had difficulties in attracting
suitably-qualified applicants, particularly females. The perception of
engineering is of hard hats and dirty hands. We decided to come up with
a fairly radical proposal aimed at dispelling public misconceptions
about what engineers are about, and what their role is.''
The faculty is nudging the glass ceiling in other ways. Dr Pollock
spends most of her time teaching on the BTech Education programme, a
four-year honours course for students who want to teach technology in
schools. She takes some satisfaction from the fact that about 25% of
students are female. That can only be good for engineering and other
technology-related areas, where female role models are urgently needed.
But, as Dr Pollock pointed out, it is a long-term project.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry under way as hunt continues for Nimrod bodies</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976535755</RECORDNO>

A SPECIALIST Canadian military diving team yesterday began the
operation to recover the bodies of the seven RAF crew who died when
their Nimrod plunged into Lake Ontario during an air display.
Last night the six-man board of inquiry who will investigate the
tragedy arrived in Canada on board a Nimrod to begin their work. Experts
on the Nimrod's flying, engineering, and electronic capabilities, they
will co-opt further expertise in specialist areas as required.
Squadron Leader John Horrocks said at RAF Kinloss, the Nimrod's base,
that they were following no theories at the moment.
He said that the initial diving had been carried out by police divers
but that because of the dangers from the jagged metal wreckage of the
aircraft a Canadian Navy team wearing protective clothing had been
called in. They started diving late yesterday afternoon.
The 80-tonne aircraft, believed to have hit the lake at more than
230mph, is lying in 70ft of water in four main sections.
After the recovery of the bodies the next priority will be to recover
the ''black box'' flight recorder aboard the anti-submarine aircraft. It
is a 1960s-era recorder, however, and not as sophisticated as those on
modern aircraft.
It will require a specialist salvage vessel and team to recover the
aircraft itself and it may be several days before that operation is
considered. The board of inquiry is likely to want to see a video of the
wreckage before it is moved to ensure that nothing that might be provide
a clue to the cause is missed.
The team will also be interviewing witnesses and analysing any
conversations the crew may have had with air traffic control.
The inquiry will be assisted by the considerable footage of television
and amateur video film which has been gathered from the thousands of
enthusiasts who were watching the Canadian National Exhibition Airshow
on Saturday afternoon when the Nimrod nosedived into the lake.
Some spectators suggested that the Nimrod suddenly lost power but this
is thought to be ''extremely unlikely'' by experts.
''Nimrods are powered by Rolls-Royce Spey engines, which are very
reliable,'' an RAF spokesman said. ''It seems almost inconceivable that
all four engines could lose power at the same time. During the
well-established air show flying routines there are frequent changes in
the power applied to the engines and we think that civilian observers
would not be fully aware of this.''
Meanwhile, the young widow of one of the Nimrod crew faces the ordeal
of giving birth in a few weeks' time without the support of her husband.
Mrs Heather Barnett, 32, said: ''I don't know how I'll cope without
Craig but I will just have to for the sake of our little boy and my
unborn baby.''
Heather and Craig Barnett, 32, had been married 10 years. They met at
school while both studied for their A-levels in their home town of
Sheffield.
As her 17-month-old son Ryan played on the living-room floor, she
said: ''He is too young to realise what has happened to his father. But
he has been a great help. Looking after him takes up so much of your
time. It stops you sitting and brooding.''
Craig Barnett had been in the RAF since 1983 and the Air Cadets before
that.
His particular skill was operating the sonar equipment aboard the
Nimrod used to detect submerged submarines.
His other interests were rock-climbing and hill-walking. He was a
member of the Moray Mountaineering Club.

Sue Tranter learns how women with driving ambitions can have the
fourcourts in a spin
YOU might think twice before purchasing a used car from certain men.
But there are certain customers who refuse to buy a brand new, shiny car
from a woman. Fortunately, according to Debbie Cowan they are in the
minority.
As one of just four car sales executives for the John Martin Group,
Debbie has first-hand experience of male behaviour in one of their
favourite hunting grounds.
Despite the fact that around 42% of drivers are women that proportion
is certainly not reflected on the sales floor of most retail showrooms.
But as any woman will testify, once she has witnessed the look of
baffled panic on the face of her partner when his car grinds to a sudden
and unscheduled halt, there is no reason why women should be less
equipped to sell an automobile.
One company at least seems prepared to address the imbalance among its
staff and though the showrooms and workshops of the John Martin Group
are not yet alive with the sound of clattering heels, there is certainly
a will to give women selling opportunities once exclusively enjoyed by
men.
Women far outnumber the men in departments such as systems,
administration and marketing but there are still only four female sales
executives at the group's 21 retail outlets in Scotland.
Ali Findlay, the group marketing manager believes that this may be
down to the commonly held perceptions that prevent women considering a
job in the trade.
''But they can do as good a job as men in selling the product,'' she
says, ''and they can be particularly helpful to women buyers who may
feel intimidated by a salesman''.
Now the group is keen to encourage women into sales and has taken an
equal proportion of female applicants onto its graduate training scheme
with a view to selling as a career.
Debbie Cowan, who has already been in sales for a year, joined the
company after graduating in marketing from Caledonian University and is
currently at Weir Nissan at London Road, Glasgow.
She quickly admits that she had no real desire to enter the motor
trade but was impressed by the company's training scheme and structured
career path.
''Sales is one element of the scheme, I have already been trained in
the systems department and in sales administration,'' she says. ''The
aim of this broad grounding is to find out what area we would like to
pursue in our career.''
While enjoying her job, Debbie does find it challenging. The hours are
demanding and she can normally expect to work a 55-hour basic week. She
does two 11-hour days and could do more. She usually works at weekends
too.
''If you are not here then you are not really committed,'' she adds.
''It is very hard work and those who think anyone could sell a car are
completely wrong.''
Apart from a job that is challenging, the rewards can be great.
According to Debbie it is possible to make a lot of money but failure to
meet targets would really mean no future in the business.
Another positive advantage is the team spirit and friendliness. Debbie
found her male colleagues very supportive when she first started, though
now to their credit they simply treat her as one of them.
''It's a job where you can make good friends because of working
closely together,'' she says. ''I don't know that I am particularly good
at the job yet, I'll get better. Apart from personality and ability to
smile a lot, a brass neck does help.''
One woman who worked her way up into a managerial job at Weir Nissan
is Margaret McIntyre who as Parts Manager has a staff of five and is on
first name terms with over 8000 bits of car.
In her small and busy office she wears a neat white blouse and dark
skirt rather than an overall and much of her work is done with a
computer.
''I began in stock control 20 years ago and then was offered the job
as manager when my boss left,'' she says.
Like Debbie, Margaret's days are long. She starts work by eight in the
morning and is still going at six in the evening. But she clearly likes
the job and the friendships. ''There's a real buzz about it'' she says.
''I can't see any reason why a woman shouldn't do the job, though it
might be more difficult for someone with children waiting at home.''
Occasionally Margaret may find a customer or someone on the phone who
asks if they can speak to the boss on the assumption that she is an
assistant. They would probably be surprised to learn that not only is
she manager but that she has won awards for her work.
Like most of her young colleagues, Jennifer Gemmell who is 24, has
long-term ambitions in the motor trade.
Originally from Ayrshire she worked in finance for five years before
becoming a sales executive in Ayr. Three months ago she joined Weir
Toyota in Colston Road, Glasgow. She plans to remain within the group
because of the opportunities for promotion and further training.
''My ultimate goal is to progress into management and hopefully one
day become a general manager, responsible for a whole outlet,'' she
says.
With over 600 people working for the John Martin Group, now Scotland's
largest independent motor retail name, Margaret will find she has
competition. But at least she will be helping to reverse the long-held
view that women have no place in a car showroom except in a photograph
draped across a shining bonnet.

SEPTEMBER is the most serious month. Only to poets does it mean
mellowness and the picking of plums. To ordinary earnest people who keep
their feet on the ground now is a time less for gathering fruit than the
planting of seed. It is about turning over leaves that are not yellowing
but new.
September's colour is brown for study. For a magic word it has
enrolment. That bell that is tolling is for night school.
In its complicating way the education industry uses other names. Night
school becomes extra mural studies. Classes are leisure or evening. More
plainly, they are called part-time.
Night school hardly suffices any more. So deep is the thirst to know
more that it sips at weekends. Pioneers of social improvement who
shouted and marched for the five-day week find that they have nurtured a
generation who want to work on Saturday mornings at learning
three-dimensional decoupage.
And courses have become as mixed as their classmates. All ages mingle.
Fresh former school children scarcely done whining and creeping like
snail unwillingly to lessons with shining morning faces come out at
night to sit alongside the desks of slippered pantaloons with
spectacles.
How Shakespeare spotted such scholarly types is a wonder. Even he,
though, might be at a loss for words about their syllabuses. Computing
gets done next door to vegetarian cooking and downstairs from car
maintenance and canine studies. A first lesson of night school is to
make sure you go into the right classroom.
Clothing your ignorance in winter garments of extra learning has
become a perplexing business. Perhaps, it always was so. What has been
more apparent this autumn lies in what management people call an extra
competitive edge.
College prospectuses have grown glossy as gaudy company
balance-sheets. Meanwhile, some places of learning have taken to
flogging their wares in train stations. Others advertise dial-a-brochure
services.
Even frivolous seekers after knowledge have their caterers. Circus
juggling is on offer. Secrets of covering cakes with marzipan can be
shared. One academy of higher science unbends to include stage fighting.
It teaches the techique of fist brawls and work with a quarterstaff.
There is a seminar on euthanasia.
Another exercise in night instruction includes the tutor's suggestion
to bring with you a cushion. If it sounds a comfy way to perch on a seat
of learning, the rest of this class's structure is barely comprehensible
to me.
That will be because personal experience has been limited to leisure
learning that had to do only with mixing stuff in cooking pots.
One of the unlisted hazards of night school is carrying home a
cauldron of pork and orange casserole of your own making. By hand I have
carted wobbly tiramisu and steaming polpetta. For once I know what I am
talking about. There ought to be honours degrees in handling a raft of
lasagne through dark streets hungry with late Big Issue sellers and
insomniac beggars.
Although backed by such real-life experience, reading night school
menus can be a mystery tour around your ignorance. What, pray, might
decoupage be? What otherwise sensible people want to leave their
firesides for a beginner's guide to the First World War? Somewhere there
is a linguistic course called holiday survival. Can it be to teach
innocent travellers abroad to say No in five languages?
Hovering over such crammed catalogues are the unmistakable, if
possibly forgotten, features of Hyman Kaplan, prince of night school
heroes.
He was a moon-faced fictional Ukrainian, a merry optimist, whose
eagerness to be educated fought with a passion to think for himself. His
pleasure was to destruct the English language in order to rebuild it as
he liked.
His attraction to evening classes was different from now. He belonged
to a generation who had fled to America from persecution at home. To
become US citizens they needed English. To teach them existed the ANPSA
-- American Night Preparatory School for Adults.
Hyman Kaplan was a wayward pupil. Asked to construct and speak a
sentence with the word choose in it, he replied: ''I hate to put on a
pair vet choose.'' He believed the opposite of dismay was next June.
Yet better than most he expressed the enthusiasm of late learners. ''I
don't care if I don't pass,'' he declared. ''I just love the class.''
Now as then, enrolment confronts students with many nosey-parker
questions as to telephone numbers, occupation, age, and the like. Kaplan
complied with a whole autobiography about why he had left Kiev.
''Come bad times (plenty),'' he inscribed. ''So I took five years to
get my Visa and saled to wonderful US. Took l0 days and sick also l0
days.
''In NY I am heppy. But not l00%. So I am coming to school. To learn.
All. I am full all kinds embition. My Mottol is -- 'Kaplan, GO HIGH.'''
When college principals in their prospectuses talk formally about
enhancing careers or enriching personal development they have not
learned to say any more than Hymie's going high.
To be going on with, while reading again about that class to which a
cushion should be taken, I see that the tutor also recommends (yes!) a
small towel. They are only to do with something called reflexology, it
seems. Dunno what is three-dimensional decoupage.

While the Serbs seem intent on throwing away a winning hand, Tom
Gallagher writes that the Bosnian's are strengthening their negotiating
team in Geneva with the addition of a man who is not only an expert
deal-maker but can also rally Middle America to his cause
THIS week's Geneva talks on the future of Bosnia will see a new face
at the negotiating table. Muhamed Sacirbey, formerly Bosnia's ambassador
at the UN, has been promoted to Foreign Minister, a post he assumed this
summer after a rebel Serb missile blew up the helicopter in which his
predecessor was flying.
Harassed diplomats and their political masters in London and Paris may
find Sacirbey just as troublesome as Balkan ogres like Radovan Karadzic
and Slobodan Milosevic were in their prime; their bluster and serial
lies wrecked numerous ceasefires and caused seasoned diplomats like Lord
Carrington to wonder if they had chosen the right profession.
The peace plan being pushed by American envoy Richard Holbrooke would
de facto cede much of Bosnia's territory to Serbia and Croatia. Last
week, the Washington Post concluded that ''this is not a plan to be
proud of''. It ''accepts the fruits of both unspeakable 'ethnic
cleansing' and the forcible alteration of international frontiers''.
Muhamed Sacirbey will insist on a better deal for Bosnia. He
understands the American way of doing things, and is a past master at
mobilising American opinion through regular appearances on prime-time
news. The bulging postbag that American senators receive from idealistic
Americans convinced by the moral case put by Sacirbey in carefully
modulated soundbites has, at times, prevented Washington from colluding
in European carve-ups, most notably the 1993 Owen-Vance peace plan.
Sacirbey appeals to the self-image many Americans have of being an
upright, idealistic people with a mission to improve the world; a people
who do not indulge in the sell-out of nations with just causes as in
cynical Europe. His relaxed manner from the time he won a football
scholarship to Tulane University in Louisiana, along with his grasp of
American idioms, convey instant authenticity. His knowledge of corporate
strategy and deal-making from his years as a top business lawyer on Wall
Street will prepare him for the wiles of European leaders when he
confronts them in Geneva.
Any country half of whose people have been turned into refugees as the
rest of the world has largely stood aside, is incredibly unlucky.
Sacirbey's arrival on the world stage is a sign that Bosnia's luck has
not completely run out. Not yet 40, he is more familiar with
power-broking than many of his adversaries in Geneva. They may well
curse their luck that a runt of a country written off as stillborn in
1992 when it tried to escape the Serbia Magus, has produced such a
clever and convincing advocate.
As the twentieth century shudders to a close, Muhamed Sacirbey
perfectly illustrates how the world has shrunk in a process known to
social scientists as globalisation. The erosion of cultural barriers has
enabled him to be at home both in the pious small-town atmosphere of
Europe's oldest Muslim society and in the vast competitive world of
corporate America.
Sacirbey was born in Sarajevo in 1956 into a devout Muslim family
which had fallen foul of the communist authorities. They settled in Ohio
in 1987 after a peripatetic existence and, at the age of 19, he became
an American citizen.
Nurtured in a warm, protective home, the young Muhamed had a dazzling
academic career. His football scholarship was followed by a doctorate in
law and a Master of Business Administration. These academic laurels
provided an entree to the citadel of American finance on Wall Street.
Before the call to serve his battered country came, Sacirbey was already
a senior vice-president of the merchant bankers Security Pacific.
Sacirbey's appointment as Bosnian ambassador to the UN in May 1992 may
well have been an afterthought. His father was still remembered in
devout Muslim circles but his son was hardly a well-known figure on the
streets of Sarajevo. But without someone at the UN able to show by his
confident bearing that the Bosnians were not losers whose fate could be
settled at the whim of diplomatic undertakers like Lord Owen, it is
likely that the much-criticised UN response to the tragedy would have
been even more dismal.
From the start, Sacirbey strove to overturn the arms embargo on Bosnia
which Britain and France maintained in order to localise the conflict
but which critics saw as giving victory to the well-armed Serbs. He
struck up an effective alliance with Madeleine Albright, the fiesty US
ambassador to the UN and, in 1993, the US broke ranks with its Security
Council allies by joining a majority of other states in voting to lift
the arms embargo.
In no small measure, due to Sacirbey's lobbying, Douglas Hurd and John
Major had to make frequent trips across the Atlantic in 1994-5 to
prevent Bill Clinton lifting the arms embargo. British politicians made
sure that they did not get caught in the same television studio as
Sacirbey or debate live with him.
London's argument was that lightly armed British troops would be
endangered by the military free-for-all that the lifting of the embargo
would produce. By this summer, Sacirbey was saying that the UK and other
countries which had adopted studied neutrality to the combatants,
irrespective of the mountain of human rights abuses carried out by the
Serbian side, should get out altogether.
In an interview with a Sarajevan paperhe expressed his preference for
dealing with countries with UN troops that had seen the justice of the
Bosnian cause, such as the Islamic states and the Netherlands. He
claimed that ''all the conflicts since the Second World War . . . show
that the West has waged them against those whose skins were dark,
yellow, or black. If Westerners claim to set such store by freedom and
democracy, they should abjure such policies''.
It is likely that Sacirbey was playing to the domestic gallery. He is
still better-known to American television audiences than to besieged
Sarajevans and, through such remarks, he can show Bosnians that he
shares their fury at the abdication of the West before tyranny; perhaps
such a fiery statement also portends his entry into Bosnian politics
with the race to succeed 70-year-old President Izetbegovic already on.
At a conference in the Middle East last August, I remarked to a
Bosnian official that he might not know it but Sacirbey's diplomatic
efforts were equivalent to knocking out an entire Serb division on the
battlefield. This has been a war fought on television and in the press
far from Bosnia itself.
Douglas Hurd more than once rued the disruptive presence of cameras
and reporters. There is no doubt that press disclosure of the Serb
concentration camp at Omarska in August, 1992 -- weeks after its
existence was already known to UN officials -- made it very difficult to
force through a realpolitik solution based on the non-principle that
might is right.
Sacirbey's eloquent condemnation of the West's moral blindness and
neglect of its own security interests, struck a chord in at least some
of the homes of Middle America. Even a Clinton loyalist like Dianne
Feinstein, Democratic senator for California, broke ranks with the White
House and became an advocate of lifting the arms embargo.
The US Congress finally delivered such a vote at the end of July.
Sacirbey has long sought to Americanise the conflict and he had put in
many late-night phone calls to US senators to achieve this turnaround.
His task now is to make sure that the changed military position in
Bosnia is translated into a peace plan that reduces the land allocated
to the rebel Serbs and ensures the territorial integrity of Bosnia. It
will not be made easier by the return of Serb unity. President Milosevic
has at last reined in Karadzic whom he accused of behaving like a
drunken poker player frittering away what last year appeared an
invincible hand.
Sacirbey enjoys good relations with Croat officials in Zagreb and
another task is to ensure that the idea that Serbia and Croatia might
divide Bosnia between them finally dies the death.
To succeed, he needs to retain the confidence of informed American
opinion and the US Congress. This means stilling any talk of an
exclusive Muslim state in a truncated Bosnia.
As long as Bosnia remains faithful to a multi-cultural vision, it will
be far less easy for predators to divide it up or for the West to sell
it cheap. Sacirbey is the lightning conductor who has channelled the
global concern which, in no small measure, has enabled Bosnia to survive
in the teeth of fearful adversity.

THE sudden death, at just over 58 years, of Douglas Miller, Forbes
Professor of Neurosurgery at Edinburgh University, robs neurosurgery in
Britain of an academic leader and the world of one of its most gifted
researchers into brain injury.
Professor Miller's achievements reflected his own activities and also
his immense capacity to influence others. His clear commitment to
improving the quality of care of patients, through the highest standards
of clinical practice, was a constant stimulus to colleagues and an
inspiration to trainees, many of whose careers he influenced profoundly.
He was liked and admired both for his talents and for his open, genuine,
good-humoured personality.
Douglas Miller was born in Glasgow and schooled at Glasgow Academy. He
began his undergraduate career at Glasgow University by studying modern
languages -- gaining a clarity of speech and writing that was the envy
of medical colleagues -- but chose to transfer to medicine, graduating
in 1961. A Doctorate in Medicine at Glasgow University was followed by a
post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania which refined
his laboratory and clinical investigative skills.
He returned to Glasgow in 1971 to spend five years with Professor
Bryan Jennett as senior lecturer in neurosurgery, beginning a period of
immense productivity which continued when he moved to the US as Lind
Lawrence Professor at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond.
There, he helped to create an internationally renowned
inter-disciplinary research programme on head injury.
In 1981 he returned to Scotland to the Chair of Surgical Neurology at
Edinburgh University. He had a flair for research, picking questions
that were important and answerable with the techniques available at the
time. His work was characterised by an ability to take problems from the
clinic to the laboratory then back to applications in patients.
Among his many contributions, he might be remembered most for
highlighting, characterising, and quantifying what he termed ''secondary
insults'' -- disturbances of brain and body physiology likely to lead to
additional brain damage supervening upon the effects of the initial
injury.
Professor Miller's work was well supported by the Medical Research
Council, which recently chose Edinburgh as the location for the major
Clinical Research Initiative, co-directed by him and focusing on
research into acute brain injury from head trauma and stroke.
His firm friendships with erstwhile colleagues in Glasgow led to an
unprecedented number of joint ventures between East and West, including
the organising of international courses sponsored by the British Council
and the staging of two international symposia. Douglas Miller served as
president of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons between 1992
and 1994 and held many international honours.
He is survived by his wife Margot -- who was immensely supportive to
him throughout his career while pursuing her own in nursing -- and by
his sons Derek and Kenneth.

BREAST cancer expert Professor Michael Baum yesterday denied calling
for the national screening programme he pioneered to be scrapped.
Professor Baum found himself at the centre of controversy after he was
quoted as saying the X-ray tests performed on more than one million
women a year were ''not worth doing''.
His reported remarks prompted a robust response from the Government's
Chief Medical Officer, Dr Kenneth Calman, who insisted: ''All the
evidence shows that the breast screening programme is working well.''
The Cancer Research Campaign, which spends up to #10m a year on breast
cancer research, said that the programme was saving lives and scrapping
it would be ''foolish''.
Yesterday the professor, who resigned from the NHS breast cancer
screening advisory group three months ago, tried to defuse the situation
by issuing a statement.
He claimed his comments had been misinterpreted by the Sunday Times,
which published the report, and denied that he thought breast screening
was ''useless''.
However Professor Baum, who helped launch Britain's first breast
cancer screening programme in 1990, admitted questioning the
effectiveness of the tests both as regards death rates and cost.
The programme offers three-yearly examinations to look for
pre-cancerous lumps in women in the highest risk 50 to 64 age group.
Breast cancer kills 13,000 women a year. Dr Calman said the #27m
programme could save the lives of 1250 women a year and was a ''very
important investment''.
The argument over Professor Baum's views arose from a letter published
last month in the medical journal, the Lancet.
In his statement the professor said he wrote the letter to highlight
the fact that breast cancer death rates had been falling before the
screening programme started.
He was pointing out that ''we may have to wait another few years'' to
see if the programme improved on benefits already gained from new forms
of treatment.
Professor Baum added in the statement: ''I also wanted to question the
cost-effectiveness of the programme and to suggest that at times of
cutbacks in the funding of cancer research that it would be better value
for money to invest in improving treatment rather than improving
screening.
''It must be understood that for every 1000 women screened over a
10-year period only three are likely to benefit. Whereas with an
effective treatment programme, for every 1000 patients treated 100 might
benefit over the same period of time.''
But he said he still believed screening under certain circumstances
might achieve a ''modest reduction'' in breast cancer deaths and was
therefore ''not a 'useless test'''.
''I also believe that the NHS screening programme has done much to
raise the standards of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment,'' he said.

Instead of going through the motions of maintaining a foreign policy,
Britain is being urged to take a bolder role, writes William Russell
DOUGLAS Hurd once memorably claimed Britain fought above her true
weight in the world. He would, wouldn't he? It is what any
self-respecting British Foreign Secretary has to say, because to say
things were otherwise would be to admit that our standing in the world
is not what it was.
Was he stating a truth, or whistling in the wind? Do we simply align
ourselves with the strong, making a virtue out of necessity. David
Howell, chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, who
clearly believes we are not fighting our true weight, called yesterday
for a less submissive approach to foreign policy on the part of Mr
Hurd's successor, Malcolm Rifkind.
The time had come to change our tune, to make boldness be our friend,
to plough our own furrow, and to cease having our policy or interests
dictated by either Washington or Brussels, he said. He also advanced the
view that, contrary to the opinion of pollsters and others, British
foreign policy would ''play a vital role in . . . determining whether
the Conservatives gain another term''. It is a controversial prophecy,
foreign affairs not being noted as having decided a General Election,
but given the importance of Europe and the situation in the former
Yugoslavia it could turn out to be accurate.
Mr Howell is one of the Foreign Secretaries who never were. In the
Heath Government he was a man on his way up, starting in the Whips
office, and then moving to the Civil Service Department, Northern
Ireland, and finally to Energy as a Minister of State.
Although much too wet for Mrs Thatcher's taste, he survived in her
administration as Energy Secretary and then Transport Secretary for her
first three years before she got rid of him. Foreign affairs was always
an interest and since 1987 he has chaired the Foreign Affairs Select
Committee. It is an influential body, and he has been an impressive
chairman, using it in the classic manner. The chairmanship provides a
position of strength from which to commentate on foreign policy, and his
views count.
A new Foreign Secretary means there is an opportunity for changes of
direction in policy, and Mr Rifkind, while he is the heir Mr Hurd
undoubtedly hoped for, is his own man. So what does Mr Howell want?
He believes:
* We have been too quick to back American diplomacy in the former
Yugoslavia, and we should be arming the Bosnians so that they can defend
themselves.
* We have been too eager to participate in the UN's Beijing Conference
on Women and, while attendance may be necessary, it should not be
uncritical given some of the statements issuing from it.
* We have been too ready to appease Russia and we should instead
recognise that our true and best friends are in the new democracies of
East and Central Europe.
* We are too reluctant to press our own views based on our own
interests on the European Union front. He argues that the EU accounts
for only 21% of Britain's global investment, the remainder lying in
North America, Africa and, above all, booming Asia. We have been
neglecting the Commonwealth, he says.
On his appointment Mr Rifkind would not even confirm he would be
attending the Auckland meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government
next month, so Mr Howell seems to have a point. Once the presence of a
British Foreign Minister would have been obligatory, one of the
bi-annual highlights of his calendar and even the caution of being newly
in the job would have been unnecessary.
The problem about this year's CHOGM is what to talk about now that
South Africa is once again back in the fold. The other African states
where democracy is in a parlous condition have paid little heed to
previous attemps by CHOGM to lay down a code of conduct, and this year's
meeting is shorter than usual -- a mere five days, including one day's
retreat where informal talks take place. But it is being held in the
Pacific and the Commonwealth Pacific rim states view it as important.
Mr Howell is right in that Europe dominates British politics way
beyond its true weight. It was one of Mr Hurd's grouses that it took up
so much of his time so unproductively. But the British media, unless it
is focused on natural disasters or wars, is obsessed with Europe, with
the machinations of Brussels which is seen as interfering with our
traditional way of life, as a monster gravy train for failed national
politicians and avaricious bureaucrats.
The Commonwealth propagandists have failed to counter the argument, to
resell an idea perceived by some as past its time.
The Beijing conference speaks for itself. That Beijing should have
been chosen is one thing, but such conferences do little good. Like
Royal Commissions they take minutes and waste years. They also pass
resolutions which are generally ignored.
Whether we have pandered to Russian demands is a matter of judgment.
The West has backed glasnost and perestroika, first Mr Gorbachev and
then Mr Yeltsin, more possibly on the principle that it is better the
devil you know than anything else. Mr Yeltsin is not perfect, but the
alternative is worse. The enlargement of Nato is on the agenda, but new
members have to be able to accept the obligations of membership apart
from anything else. The collapse of the Warsaw Pact leaves a security
vacuum as far as Russia is concerned and causes genuine fears, hence the
Partnership for Peace initiative.
Nor would Mr Hurd, and presumably Mr Rifkind, accept that we have
neglected our natural friends in the new democracies. We have been
investing through the Know-How Fund in all of them, providing the kind
of expertise which will help them create economies which can face up to
their new freedom. Mr Rifkind, on his first official overseas trip since
assuming office, was at it yesterday. In the Ukraine he announced #4m
worth of new projects, and said that over the coming year the aim was to
increase the fund's spending there by about 40%.
Talking about European institutions and their enlargement, he made
clear that each state must expect to make its own contribution and
accept some of the costs.
It is over the situation in the former Yugoslavia that Mr Howell has
grounds for wondering whether we got it right. Mr Hurd placed his faith
in the diplomatic process. Talk could solve everything. The trouble is,
that only works if two play the game. When the people you talk to cannot
be trusted to keep their word the diplomatic process is hamstrung from
the start.
The result was that people talked tough, but did not follow through.
Now the UN has followed through, but very late in the day. America has
no wish to become involved on the ground -- President Clinton, having
avoided one Vietnam is not about to become involved in another. But, as
Mr Rifkind, when Defence Secretary, argued, one cannot bomb people to
the negotiating table, which is what seems to be being attempted. Mr
Howell's case is that the latest air strikes carried out by Nato should
be part of a sustained and widened strategy to deter Serbian aggression
permanently and that this can only by done by simultaneously building up
the Bosnian nation to defend itself.
Mr Rifkind is not a natural diplomatist, a master of tact and the
precise phrase, like Mr Hurd. His nature is more belligerent, so
possibly he will heed Mr Howell's advice on a wide range of issues. But
that leaves Washington. Britain clings to the coat tails of the special
relationship a bit like a drowning man does to any handy spar of wood.
Without it we are not nothing, but our claim to matter is diminished. It
may be an illusory relationship, but even a mirage can be exploited to
advantage.
Speaking in the Ukraine yesterday he said that one of the lessons
learned from the disaster in Bosnia was that conflict prevention was
infinitely preferable to damage limitation. But damage limitation is
what the name of the game appeared to be for a long time, possibly too
long.
In speaking out Mr Howell is voicing opinions about how British
foreign policy was conducted during the Hurd years which he is not alone
in holding. Mr Hurd's safe hands were famous, but people with safe hands
do not take risks and Mr Howell is advocating, if not a riskier
strategy, a bolder, more up-front approach.

women on world stage: Jennifer Cunningham reports on the battle for
control over their own lives
AMID the euphoria of their challenging behaviour, delegates to both
the fringe and official versions of the UN World Conference on Women in
Beijing should reflect that the UN first set up its Commission on the
Status of Women nearly half a century ago in 1946.
So what's been achieved? The first world conference was held in Mexico
City in 1975 as part of International Women's Year. Western women saw
feminism as a radical and empowering political movement. The future was
rosy. Even the UN jumped on the bandwagon, declaring the next 10 years a
''Decade for Women''.
By the time it was brought to a close at the UN Conference on Women in
Nairobi in 1985, it had been dubbed ''the invisible decade'' because so
little had been achieved. In world terms, women still did two-thirds of
the work for one-tenth of the pay.
Another 10 years on and the world's women are meeting in Beijing. In
the Forbidden City the differences between the expectations and actions
of women in the developed and developing world are the dramatic stuff
which makes international news items.
Women used to exercising their own power have not taken kindly to
being manhandled by security guards, who make no distinction between
internationally-known lawyers, disgraced wives of presidents, militant
lesbians, Tibetan exiles and Rwandans and Croatians protesting at the
use of rape as a military weapon. They are regarded collectively as bad
women who overstep the mark by security guards in the Chinese capital.
Whatever their background or status, the essence of what all these
women want is control over their own lives, starting with control over
their own bodies.
Already the powerful alliance of Vatican-Islamic rigidity on the
issues of sexual relationships and abortion versus Western liberalism is
being billed as the major debate. Women, not just in the West, are
frankly impatient with this endless disguising of the essence of the
argument which is less about sex than power. Diplomatic skills, however,
will be brought to bear.
Locating this conference in China has ensured that human rights in
general are high on the agenda. Where they differ from women's rights is
not always clear. ''Securing the equality of women and men, in law and
in fact, is the great political project of the twentieth century,'' UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a speech read at the
start of the conference.
The Platform for Action which this largest-ever UN conference is
expected to pass by September 15 will include strategies to combat the
''poverty, disease, ignorance and violence which oppress millions of
women and prevent them playing an equal role with men in society''.
The UK stance, according to a Foreign Office spokesman, is: ''The
paper we hope will emerge will allow freedom of choice to women on
issues of health, education, and hope that in more countries women will
have more control over their own lives including control over their own
fertility.''
Fertility is the big issue, with alarm already sounded at the prospect
of losing the agreement achieved painstakingly last year at the World
Population Conference in Cairo.
After heated debate in which the world split into four blocks: Muslim
states, the Vatican and its Roman Catholic allies, developing countries,
and rich Western states, a programme was agreed which stated that people
had the right to ''a state of complete physical, mental, and social
well-being'', in all matters relating to reproduction''. Since the
programme is not binding, individual countries can interpret it in their
own way.
The Cairo conference is inextricably linked with Beijing: they were
meant to follow one another. The UK delegation to each has been headed
by Baroness Chalker, the Overseas Development Minister. She has promised
a review of the ODA's gender-equality strategy. Other UK commitments
announced by Cheryl Gillan, ministerial co-ordinator of Policy on Women,
include a 15% increase in the target for out-of-school care, seeking
election to the UN Commission on the Status of Women in 1996, and
withdrawing some of the UK's reservations to the UN Convention on All
Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
Scottish Women, faced with the difficulty of going to Beijing in any
number, have sent their own report to the Government and to the UN.
Ronnie McDonald, of the STUC, who played a major role in drawing it up,
said it will come into its own after the conference as the most
authoritative agenda for women in Scotland. It was the result of
wide-ranging consultation with a variety of organisations and
individuals ranging from the Church of Scotland Woman's Guild to the
Scottish Prostitutes Education Project.
''The reason we carried out that extensive consultation was that there
was no consultation with women in Scotland. There was extremely lively
discussion among women and we will now use the document for lobbying not
only in the UK but in Europe where Scotland is represented directly on
the European Women's Lobby,'' she said.
Their recommendations range from a simplification of employment law to
flexible, affordable childcare, a mandatory audit of discriminatory
practices in employment, and the decriminalisation of prostitution.
It is the same argument which calls for girl babies in China to be as
valued as their brothers, but it needs complete solidarity.

Alan MacDermid examines the current controversy over the efficacy of
breast screening, with a claim that a pioneer of the system questions
its value
KEEP having the mammograms and leave the experts to count the beans --
that is probably the best advice to women today as the latest
controversy over the effectiveness of cancer screening unravels.
Distinguished cancer surgeon Professor Michael Baum was the latest to
step into the maelstrom, adding to the confusion yesterday by rebutting
weekend reports that he wanted to scrap the breast screening service he
helped set up.
Professor Baum, who was said to consider the tests not worth doing
because they saved too few lives, cost too much, and caused needless
worry to too many women, claimed yesterday that the Sunday Times had
misinterpreted his comments.
However Baum is on record as questioning screening in a letter in last
month's Lancet headed, Screening for breast cancer, time to think -- and
stop?
He may not have written the headline, but his message was pretty
clear: ultimately he suggested that the screening centres be turned into
open access, super-specialist clinics for women with symptoms.
This was apparently prompted by what he saw as an attempt by the NHS
breast-cancer screening service to claim more than its share of the
credit for the 11% decline in deaths among the screening target group --
women aged 50-64 -- in England and Wales between 1985 and 1993.
Apart from anything else he believes some of the credit goes to the
widespread use of the hormone drug tamoxifen as a back-up for treatment
in post-menopausal women.
Baum also cited a damning report in the Lancet a few weeks previously
by two Canadian professors, C J Wright and C B Mueller, who reviewed a
whole series of trials of screening from America, Canada, Sweden, and
Edinburgh; in the last of these a controlled trial of 23,226 women
produced 68 deaths among those screened compared with 76 among those not
screened.
Wright and Mueller's view may have been influenced by the development
of screening in the market-led North American health-care system where
tests and biopsies are big business. Among adverts they quote: ''If you
are over 35 and haven't had a mammogram you need more than your breasts
examined.''
However Professor Baum uses their arithmetic to demonstrate that if
the NHS screening programme achieved half its target, each life saved
would cost #1m, and questions whether better gains might not be made by
putting this money into the development of more effective treatments.
None of this was good news to cancer surgeons like Professor David
George, who gets patients both through screening and through the
open-access clinics he runs at Glasgow Western Infirmary for women with
symptoms.
''My view is very strongly in favour of screening,'' he said. ''Its
introduction was recommended by the Forrest report, which was based on a
pretty aggressive review of the literature and state of the art.
''The bulk of the evidence is very much in favour, and there are many
spin-offs -- it results in more women being treated by specialist
centres. It concentrates everyone's mind on improving treatment.''
Screening has been running in Glasgow since 1988, and data is now
being built up on women in whom cancer was detected and who have been
followed-up for five years or more.
''Although it is too early to make any judgments, the results look
extremely encouraging, although it would be a bit premature to put a
figure on it,'' said Professor George.
''What worries me about this sort of debate is that it can be
counter-productive, by putting women off attending. I would encourage
them to attend when they get their invitation.
''A small proportion of ladies will have an anxiety-inducing
experience. We are trying to get round that -- it is a real problem but
it relates to a small number of people.''
Out of 100 women who attend, he says, more than 90 will get an
immediate all-clear. Six will get recalls -- the point where the
possibility they might have cancer starts to loom large.
They may require biopsies but they will get a same-day result; fewer
than one out of the original 100 will have a diagnosis of cancer.
''I accept that with the 5% who are recalled but do not have anything
significantly wrong you are creating anxiety,'' said Professor George.
''But we do our best to minimise this -- we have counselling, and the
result the same day.''
At the moment the greatest scope for expanding screening lies in
increasing the percentage of eligible women who accept the invitation.
It runs about 70% and more lives could be saved if that were higher.
Extension in other directions, however, is also under review in the
screening service -- reducing the threshold age from 50 and increasing
the frequency from three years to two.
Both are still contentious, the lower age threshold because detecting
tumours in younger breast tissue has its difficulties. The three-year
interval has been judged the most cost-effective, but the sharp rise in
cancer after the second year puts Professor George among advocates for
increased frequency.
Detecting cancer in younger women may have to await improvements
in technology, for example the development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
for this purpose -- current equipment is not suitable.
''In the meantime I think we could be looking at extending the age
limit at the other end,'' said Professor George.
''Invitations currently stop at 65; I think we could extend them
beyond that -- but it has to be emphasised that women older than 65 are
still entitled to come and be screened on their own initiative.''

<HEADLINE>Sheriff clears Joe Longthorne of 3am assault in hotel bar</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976535768</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ENTERTAINER Joe Longthorne was cleared yesterday of assaulting Freddie
Starr's manager in an early-morning fracas in Glasgow's Hilton Hotel.
After hearing three hours of evidence, Sheriff Peter Paterson told the
52-year-old TV, theatre and recording artist that he was finding him not
guilty of assaulting 61-year-old Mr Leon Fisk three years ago.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that Mr Fisk and Mr Longthorne's nephew
and manager, Mr Keith Holliday, 24, had bet each other #1000 over who
could fill a theatre more quickly -- Joe Longthorne or Freddie Starr.
When Mr Fisk joined Mr Longthorne's company at 3am in the hotel bar,
he mentioned the bet. Trouble flared, with tables and chairs being
overturned and drinks being spilled.
Giving evidence, Mr Fisk claimed that, seconds after he shook Mr
Longthorne's hand in the bar, he saw Mr Longthorne angrily pointing his
finger at his nephew. Then he was punched between the eyes and the cheek
and side of his face. After the attack he was bleeding badly.
Mr Fisk claimed that the finger-pointing was a secret gesture between
Mr Longthorne and his nephew to ''encourage action''.
Asked about the #1000 bet, Mr Fisk claimed it had been made three
years ago with Mr Holliday, and when it was mentioned at 3am it was done
in a very joking fashion.
Comedian Michael Lancaster, 46, a former member of the Dallas Boys
group, told the court that when he sat down to join Mr Longthorne and
friends, Mr Longthorne suddenly jumped to his feet, swore and said that
he would never work again.
Then, he said, Mr Longthorne turned to his nephew and ranted on about
the #1000 bet. Seconds later Mr Fisk was punched by Mr Holliday. Mr
Lancaster added: ''It was my impression Mr Longthorne was inciting him
to hit him.''
During the incident, he said, Mr Longthorne's minder lifted his boss
with one arm and dragged him away.
In evidence, Mr Longthorne said that Mr Fisk arrived at his table and,
after he had greeted him, looked at Mr Holliday, swore and asked for his
#1000.
Mr Longthorne told his solicitor, Mr Paul Hannah, that he was annoyed
about people gambling over his career, especially a man who professed to
be a manager.
He added: ''He picked up a guy much younger than him and tried this
on. We don't want that kind of gangster stuff here.''
Mr Longthorne told Ms Gillian Maudsley, prosecuting, that Mr Fisk
waswell-known as being very loud.
''When he came to the table I said, 'Well, Mr Fisk, it's nice to see
you.' I didn't point my finger at my nephew to hit this old man. That is
not what happened.
''I didn't see him being punched, but I do accept that he must have
been hit. I didn't instigate anything at all.
''What Mr Fisk did regarding the bet was hateful, and I am sorry he
ended up with his face the way it was. But the last thing I want to see
in any public place is a brawl. It is not in my nature.''
After three hours of evidence, Sheriff Paterson criticised Mr Fisk's
account as unreliable, and also criticised the evidence of Mr Lancaster.
He found Mr Longthrone not guilty.

<TEXT>
A DOCTOR who is fighting to clear his name after the residential home
he ran was closed down by social workers has blamed the events on
insistence on excessive record-keeping.
Dr Sohail Chaudhry, who is conducting an appeal against Strathclyde's
withdrawal of registration for his Caldwell House establishment last
December, told a tribunal at Paisley Sheriff Court that he had been
continually frustrated over the social work department's need for more
and more paperwork to be completed.
As the case resumed yesterday, Dr Chaudhry claimed the ground rules
were constantly being changed as he struggled to keep up with the
requirements of senior social worker Davina Young.
Cross-examining Mr Alistair Sinclair, responsible for the care of the
elderly in the run-up to the closure, Dr Chaudhry said: ''We were
wishing to do what was expected of us -- provide care, not mountains of
paperwork to satisfy over-inflated egos.''
He claimed that Mrs Young had only been interested in fault-finding
and had suppressed positive aspects of the home's activities.
Mr Sinclair said he was aware there had been positive aspects, but
said he had been concerned about aspects not in the interests of the
well-being of residents.
He said levels of care might often have been perfectly adequate, but
there had been a shortfall in the management of that care.
The tribunal continues.

Larnaca
AN army spade allegedly used by three British soliers to kill a Danish
holiday tour guide in Cyprus bore no fingerprints of the accused
killers, a witness told a court today.
Inspector Aristophanes Charalambous, head of the fingerprints section
of Cyprus police, testified that a spade listed by prosecutors as the
murder weapon had no fingerprints on it at all.
British servicemen Alan Ford, 26, Justin Fowler, 27, and Jeff Pernell,
23, deny beating Louise Jensen to death with the shovel found in their
beach buggy when they were arrested close to their military base nearly
a year ago.
They have pleaded not guilty to charges of abducting, conspiring to
rape and then killing Miss Jensen, 23, who worked in the resort of Ayia
Napa, on September 13 last year.
The woman's battered corpse was found two days after her boyfriend
reported she was kidnapped by the three soldiers.
A pair of boots and a belt belonging to the woman found close to her
makeshift grave in the village of Paralimni were also clear of
fingerprints, the inspector testified.
But he said he found bloodied fingerprints, and prints from a persons'
palm on the beach buggy.
He was cut short of revealing his findings, since his qualifications
and expertise were strongly contested by defence lawyers, as the
defendants sat in the dock scribbling notes with instructions to them.
Court president Takis Eliades overruled several objections made by the
defence as to the admissibility of the inspector's findings.
Earlier in today's hearing Ford's lawyer Tasos Katsikikides complained
that prison guards had seized notes written by the accused with
instructions on his defence. The court ruled there was no issue to
study.
The three, who were stationed at the British base of Dhekelia, have
been in custody at the island's central prison for close to a year
pending trial.--Reuter.

Srinagar
KASHMIRI separatists detonated a car bomb in Srinagar today, killing
at least 13 people in an audacious attack in the centre of the heavily
fortified city, witnesses said.
The Hizbul Mujaheddin guerrilla group claimed responsibility in a
telephone call to a Western news agency and said the bomb was aimed at
Indian soldiers outside a bank in the city centre.
Witnesses said five of the dead appeared to be soldiers.
Officials at the government-run hospital where casualties were brought
said 20 wounded were admitted, and three were in surgery. One died on
arrival.
The bomb went off in a car near a police station and outside a branch
of the government-owned State Bank of India, where Indian soldiers
fighting the separatist insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir congregate at
the beginning of every month to collect their pay.
A bomb placed on a scooter in almost exactly the same location in late
1992 killed two people and shopkeepers had been pressing authorities for
payments to the soldiers to be made elsewhere.
The explosion was just down the road from Ahdoo's, one of the only
hotels left open in the city and packed with foreign journalists
covering the Kashmir hostage crisis, which entered its third month
today.
Witnesses said an army truck was parked in the vicinity when the bomb
went off at around 1.30pm (8am GMT). Three cars and five scooters were
destroyed in the blast.
The wheels had been blown off one car and the tin roofs of shops
opposite were riddled with holes from the debris.
''I was going to buy food when I heard a huge explosion. The next
thing I knew I was lying on the ground with injuries to my neck and
stomach,'' hotel worker Ghulam Qadir Khan told Reuters at the hospital
where he was being treated.
''It's only the poor like me who suffer,'' he said.
Witnesses saw 12 bodies after the blast, two of them women and five
others dressed in military uniform. Some of the corpses were badly
mutilated.
Security forces arrived quickly and carried off the bodies. Police
cordoned off the area saying there could be another bomb.
The blast was preceded by a grenade explosion which the guerrillas
said was meant to warn civilians away from the car bomb.
Police and hospital sources say more than 20,000 people have been
killed in the five-year insurgency by separatist militants in Jammu and
Kashmir, predominantly Hindu India's only Muslim majority state.
An unusually large number of foreign journalists, Western diplomats
and hostage crisis advisers are in Srinagar while negotiations continue
to secure the release of four Western tourists held by guerrillas in the
Kashmir Valley since early July.
Americans Donald Hutchings and John Childs and Britons Paul Wells and
Keith Mangan were kidnapped by the Al-Faran guerrilla group on July 4
while trekking in the Himalayan region.
Four days later Childs escaped and Al-Faran abducted German Dirk
Hasert and Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe. The Norwegian was found
beheaded on August 13.
Al-Faran, previously unknown even to Kashmiri separatist groups, has
threatened several times to kill all the hostages unless India frees at
least 15 jailed militants, including three Pakistanis.--Reuter.

Huairou, China
A BRITISH Minister asked China not to intervene on UN sites, South
Africa's Winnie Mandela was caught in a scuffle with Chinese security
staff and 150 women broke a police line embarrassing Beijing as it
hosted a UN women's conference.
The issue of police harassment and surveillance that has marred the
parallel Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) Forum on Women that opened
last Wednesday, haunted China's gala launch of the United Nations Fourth
World Conference on Women today.
''While we accept that China has a different way of life, this is a UN
conference, not a Chinese conference. If they invite the UN here they
should keep to UN rules,'' Baroness Chalker, leading Britain's
delegation to the conference, told reporters.
The Minister of Overseas Development cited people being followed at
the NGO forum and said that while this was not commonplace ''the fact
that it is happening at all is obviously against the UN regulations for
such a conference''.
Winnie Mandela, estranged wife of South African President Nelson
Mandela, missed the welcome extravaganza when she and 20 South African
delegates turned up late at the Great Hall of the People and tried
unsuccessfully to force a way inside.
Delegates formed a cordon around Mandela protecting her from the worst
of the pushing and shoving with Chinese security guards in the melee
that lasted several minutes.
The fracas, involving such a high-profile personality, came as Chinese
authorities were dampening criticism of earlier incidents of
heavy-handed security at the NGO forum.
At the UN-endorsed forum, 150 women holding a protest against women's
suffering, defied Chinese police to break through a cordon marking the
boundary of the site.
The women, vanguard of a 1000-strong demonstration of women clad in
black and carrying candles, defied a Chinese order to confine their
demonstrations to the site.
''Stop, stop,'' the police said, holding up their hands.
''Let's go, let's go,'' the women responded. Walking forward led by
Thai groups, they crossed the ''red line'' demarcated by Chinese police.
''We shall overcome,'' the women sang.
A second line of young policewomen stopped the marchers.
The Asian Women's Human Rights Group staged their Women in Black
demonstration to protest against violence and discrimination against
women.
Carrying placards and banners attacking sex-trafficking, rape in armed
conflicts and abuse of Tibetan women, the marchers dispersed in the face
of the second police line and an enormous security net, including a
police blimp overhead.
''Don't forget Tiananmen Square'', ''Bosnia is bleeding'', ''Poverty
has a woman's voice too'', ''Brides are not for burning'', read some of
their placards.
Chinese Vice Minister of Public Security Tian Qiyu sought last week to
restrict activities at the NGO forum, saying demonstrations would be
allowed only in a designated area and China would not tolerate slander
or attacks on its leaders.
UN officials say China has no right to order or enforce such
restrictions inside the forum and the venue of the UN conference that
opened today.
Disputes over the intense security at the forum have threatened to
overshadow the gathering of 25,000 women.
The gathering began with an extravaganza that included female
martial-arts experts and a UN declaration that sexual equality was the
last great project of the 20th century.
''Securing the equality of women and men, in law and in fact, is the
great political project of the 20th century,'' UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a speech read at the start of the
conference.
The conference began with a lavish welcoming ceremony at which a
workers' choir sang Beethoven's Ode to Joy and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin quoted the Chinese saying that ''women hold up half the sky''.
But Jiang said discrimination against women was as old as history.
''Prejudices against women, like an invisible chain, fetter the hearts
and minds of millions. Such outworn mentality should have long been
discarded,'' he said.
Heads of 185 government delegations were among the audience in the
hall on the edge of Tiananmen Square who raised a roar of approval when
female experts fought off male attackers with vicious kicks and punches
in a martial-arts display.
''A revolution has begun,'' conference Secretary-General Gertrude
Mongella declared to huge cheers from the delegates. ''There's no going
back. There's no going back.''
The conference will pass a Platform for Action to combat the poverty,
disease, ignorance and violence that oppress millions of women and
prevent them playing an equal role with men in society.
Prime ministers Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan and Begum Khaleda Zia of
Bangladesh spoke to a gathering attended by many first ladies and Middle
Eastern princesses who mingled with pro-choice and anti-abortion
activists.--Reuter.

Mowbray, 75, in October 1988, and Mr Edward Whitehouse, 83, in November

The charges follow a police investigation into more than a dozen

Jonathan Clayton reports from Brussels on the Nato response to Serb
aggression
BOSNIAN Serb commander General Ratko Mladic has found himself firmly
fixed in Nato's sights since he miscalculated Western leaders' resolve
after the fall of two UN ''safe havens'' this summer, alliance diplomats
say.
Senior Nato diplomats say the Bosnian Serbs' overrunning of Srebrenica
and Zepa in July, along with subsequent reports of atrocities committed
against civilians and Bosnian Muslim army troops, were just ''one
humiliation too many''.
The United States, backed by the leading European allies, decided it
had to act to restore the much-damaged credibility of both the alliance
and the United Nations.
''The stakes were high. There was a feeling we just could not let the
alliance continue to be damaged like this,'' said a Nato diplomat.
After months of taunting by Bosnian Serbs, the alliance quietly agreed
a detailed plan of how to react to any further Serb attacks or threats
on the remaining UN ''safe havens''.
''We sat down with a cold, quiet determination, we walked through
every detail to make sure we got it all right -- no splits, no
weaknesses, everyone had to be certain and happy with what could
follow,'' one senior diplomat said.
At the same time, Washington -- desperate to head off a Congress which
wanted to lift the arms embargo against the Muslims -- launched a new
diplomatic drive for a peace accord.
Nato's 16 members agreed to broaden the definition of what could
trigger air strikes, including for the first time a sudden
''concentration of forces'', and to widen the zone of action for
possible reprisals and range of targets.
''Finally, and most important, we agreed to stop when you remove the
threat,'' the diplomat added.
Nato sources say alliance unity on the issue persuaded UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to agree the most critical
change of all -- letting the UN decision on action to pass from its
civilian to its military wing.
''Nato and UN military commanders now would turn the key together.
That changed everything,'' an alliance source said.
Nato, which can act in former Yugoslavia only at the request of the
United Nations, had blamed the UN's cumbersome bureaucracy for the
failure to respond quickly to Serb defiance.
As the summer wore on, Britain and France and other troop-contributing
nations to the UN Protection Force withdrew their soldiers from areas
where they could be taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs, as had happened
after previous Nato raids.
Independent analysts say two totally unconnected events then suddenly
tilted the balance further away from the Serbs.
First, the Croats' rout of the breakaway Krajina Serbs killed the
dream of a Greater Serbia.
Then, the death of three US diplomats in an accident on the
treacherous Mount Igman road into Sarajevo increased the determination
of President Bill Clinton, entering a pre-election period, not to waver.
When the Bosnian Serbs lobbed a shell into Sarajevo one week ago and
killed more than 30 people, Nato waited for the UN to point the finger
at the culprits and then blitzed the Bosnian Serbs with its biggest ever
combat mission.
The battered citizens of the Bosnian capital may have been surprised
by the tough response, but diplomats say Mladic and the Serbs were
''even more shocked''.
''They had got away with so much, they failed to sense the shift in
resolve,'' said the US diplomat.
He added the action would not stop until the siege of Sarajevo was
lifted. ''There is no question of a halt before the mission's aims are
achieved. We have come too far to lose it now.''

Zagreb
WARRING Bosnian government and Serb forces silenced their guns around
the ''safe area'' of Bihac last night ahead of the Nato ultimatum.
While Sarajevo has been the focus of attention, fighting has raged in
the western enclave over the past week with the Bosnian army probing at
Serb positions.
The Bosnian army's 5th corps has enjoyed new freedom in Bihac since
Croatia helped break the three-year siege of the pocket when it
recaptured the neighbouring Serb-held Krajina region last month.
But the silence of the guns yesterday reinforced the Muslim-led
Bosnian government's desire to ensure the focus remains firmly on the
Bosnian Serbs, not its own military actions away from Sarajevo.
UN officials in Zagreb said both sides exchanged intense fire around
Bihac town on Sunday but military activity had stopped by yesterday.
The United Nations also said there was no fighting around two other
UN-designated ''safe areas'' -- Gorazde in eastern Bosnia and Tuzla to
the north.
The stand-off around Bihac remains murky. On Friday, UN sources said
government forces were responsible for initiating attacks from the
pocket.
The UN recorded more than 300 explosions in the biggest confrontation
in the area since the Croatian offensive.
Nato and the UN have strongly advised the Bosnian government against
taking advantage of allied air strikes against Serb targets by launching
offensives to retake territory it lost during the 41-month war.
UN officials said they had been unable yet to determine which side
began the exchange of fire on Sunday.
''There was intense shelling east of Bihac town yesterday (Sunday)
along the confrontation line which we assessed to be exchanges of
fire,'' a UN spokesman said.
Major Donald Roy said two shells struck Bihac town and three hit
Cazin, north of Bihac, on Sunday, but no casualties were reported.
''Small arms fire and some 300 detonations were also heard in the
general area of Pistaline, Stijena. . . and Bosanska Krupa,'' he said.
UN sources said the Bosnian army's 5th Corps captured a large cache of
weapons when they stormed into the town of Velika Kladusa, the base of
rebel Muslim troops who aligned themselves with the Bosnian Serbs.
One source said much of the fire on Sunday could be attributed to
training manoeuvres by 5th Corps troops, but there were also signs the
soldiers were attempting to push at the edges of the territory they
control.
The UN has said the 5th Corps could be regrouping to stage an attack
from Bihac within a few weeks to try to win back large tracts of
northern Bosnia, which has been assigned to the Sarajevo government
under a 1994 peace plan.

AS world attention continues to focus on Sarajevo, disturbing new
evidence is emerging of continued atrocities in the newly-captured
Krajina region of Croatia. Herald journalist Kirsty Scott and
photographer Jeff Mitchell went on patrol yesterday with UN monitors in
the area.
THE story of Mika Borovic is one small tragedy in a conflict of
countless horrors. We found her outside her looted home in the village
of Golubic, stooped with age, grief, and isolation.
She tells us she's afraid and lonely but offers a massive leathered
hand and a gap-tooth grin in welcome. ''Thank you for coming,'' she
says. ''I am shaking all the time now.'' She is 87 and a Serb.
Since the Croatian army bulldozed through the Serb-held Krajina region
four weeks ago. there have been nightmarish tales of atrocities against
the mostly elderly Serbs, like Mika, who found themselves cast adrift
from the refugee exodus.
The UN has become increasingly frustrated at the situation, but has
met with a stony respose from Croatian officials, who vehemently deny
any knowledge of such acts, or blame phantom stragglers of routed Serb
soldiers.
''We're still getting it -- arson, looting, murder and mayhem,'' said
Alun Taylor, a UN representative in Sector South. Last week, the
Welshman had a village burned to the ground on his patch, adding some
gruesome images to his unenviable collection of human misery.
''All of the hamlet was on fire, maybe 18 to 20 houses, barns burning
with cattle inside them. In the evening, one of the men took us to two
houses. There was a man dressed in his pyjamas lying on the floor. He
was 80 years old and he had been shot behind the left ear
''There was another man who had been found in a field with some dead
cows. His throat had been cut.''
There were some 135,000 Serbs in the southern portion of Krajina and
more than 100,000 are thought to have left. Approximately 800 are packed
into a gymnasium in the UN compound in Knin. Alun and his UN colleagues
have been making regular patrols in the area to keep on eye on those who
remained, compiling a grim list of lost souls -- one that is regularly
shortened as people disappear from their homes.
It's a risky business. The area is clogged with gaggles of Croatian
army troops, lounging around the centre of Knin or dawdling amongst the
scarred and empty buildings which line the roads.
Our first stop this afternoon is at Mika's village of Golubic. Through
half-closed eyes the landscape here could almost be Tuscan, lush and
fertile and embroidered with small villages. Up close, however, the
buildings bear black smudges around the empty windows and there are dead
pigs on the road, one with its bloated belly dotted with bullet holes.
Mika would like to join her family who fled during the Croatian
offensive, but she is bent double with frailty and unsure of her future.
Two doors down we find Anka Borovic, 55, and Stevanja Radinovic, 75.
''I need to sit down,'' says Stevanja, plonking herself on to a step
and teasing the photographer for taking a shot before she has covered
her knees with her skirt.
Behind her raucous laugh we hear the rapid rattle of gunfire, only
yards to the left behind some buildings. Everyone stiffens and Alun
Taylor looks warily towards the road where two soldiers, one cradling a
semi-automatic weapon, come sauntering into view. There are some terse
acknowledgements before they move off a little and we are on our way.
Alun is sure they are on a looting sortie. He assures Anka and Stevanja
he will return tomorrow to check on them.
We head west and climb a steep hill towards Podinarje. We spot three
thin lines of smoke from a village in the valley below. ''They're
burning houses,'' says Alun in disgust.
He is keen to check on a young Serb soldier in Podinarje, one of nine
who came out of hiding and handed themselves over to the Croatian
authorities under supervision of the UN. Milan, 25, has been released,
but the others are still being held in Knin.
We are welcomed by Milan, members of his family, and a couple of other
villagers who are all staying in the one house for safety.
Milan claims he was treated well by the Croatian authorities but knows
nothing of his colleagues. He says the members of this tiny community
are terrified.
The Croatian authorities are meanwhile insisting that 65 of the
refugees in the UN base are handed over, claiming that they are war
criminals. They are refusing to let the others leave until they get
their hands on those they want. UN officials say they are now in a
Mexican stand-off.
Up inPodinarje, Dmitar Todorovic, 87, tells us he has never seen a
conflict so hard on innocent people. ''In the First World War one no one
wanted to attack civilians but now, in this one there are so many
civilians being killed.''
Back down in Grobulic, Stevanja had managed to sustain her smile until
it became clear that we must leave. She reached for Alun's hand,
mumbling thanks. Then the tears come. ''Please do not forget about us,''
she says. ''Please do not let them hurt or kill us.''

THE powerful GMB union is facing an internal challenge over its
decision to back Mrs Anne McGuire as Labour's possible candidate to
fight Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth at the next General Election.
Stirling is one of two Labour constituencies choosing their candidates
this weekend using the controversial all-woman shortleets policy, the
other is Ayr.
Labour Party officials are particularly keen that Mr Forsyth is not
given any ammunition from a public fall-out over the choosing of a woman
candidate to fight him, and so the selection process for Stirling is
taking place with the minimum of publicity.
Mrs McGuire is seen as the candidate Labour leader Tony Blair's office
would be happiest with, and is also regarded as the favourite candidate
of Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
However, she faces a strong challenge from left-wing activist Ms
Rosina McCrae, who is on the executive of the Scottish Labour Party with
Mrs McGuire, and Central Region's convener, Ms Anne Wallace.
A fourth candidate on the shortleet is Ms Lynne Joyce, from Yorkshire,
who is not expected to be in the running.
Ms McCrae's GMB branch attempted to nominate her for the Stirling
seat, but was told by the general workers' union's Scottish headquarters
that it had already backed Mrs McGuire, and could not be seen to be
nominating two candidates.
Her branch is now demanding an explanation of what union rule this was
decided under. Party activists who support Ms McCrae see the decision as
an attempt by the Labour hierarchy to marginalise her.
Ms Anne Wallace is regarded by some officials as too inexperienced to
fight Mr Forsyth, but to write her off may be a mistake and, with strong
local support, she could come through the middle to take the nomination.

RAILWAYS Minister John Watts faces a rough ride next week over
diminishing prospects of upgrading the West Coast main line in the wake
of the Government's admission it will not be sold before the next
General Election.
The ageing Glasgow-London artery needs modernised at a cost of #600m
to #1000m, but potential investors have been scared off by the confusion
surrounding the privatisation programme.
Its condition is such that InterCity West Coast's director, Mr Ivor
Warburton, has already warned of ''catastrophic failures'' unless a
refurbishment goes ahead soon.
At a meeting in London today, the West Coast Rail 250 Campaign, whose
members include 80 local authorities and a similar number of private
sector organisations, is expected to demand an upgrading, regardless of
political or practical problems.
Scottish concerns will be highlighted by Strathclyde Regional Council,
adamant that shorter journey times for freight as well as passengers
must be introduced.
The warning that UK regional economies are suffering because the
Anglo-Scottish rail link is far below that of European competitors will
be underlined by members from Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool.
The influential pressure group has been trawling the Government,
railway industry, and European Union in recent weeks to stress that the
line is fast wearing out.
The sudden collapse in private funding is of particular concern, but
campaigners are determined the money must be found from whatever source.
Members will meet Mr Watts on Monday, and demand that the Government's
upgrading, which was announced in 1993, is carried through.
They are especially concerned that no works' timetable or funding
schedule exists for a railway project widely acknowledged as the most
important in Britain after the Channel Tunnel link.
They suspect a planned ''core programme'' of refurbishment offers
nothing in the way of greater speeds or increased capacity.
The campaign group, formed in 1992 after upgrading involving high
speed trains was abandoned, also fears that no new rolling stock will be
on the line for seven years and that research and development work on
new signalling alone will take five years.
Mr Watts is likely to be pressed on several key issues following the
decision to postpone InterCity West Coast's privatisation.
One question will be who will now define the level of upgrading,
especially when investment by train operators will not be available
until franchises are agreed.

LABOUR embarrassment over how to pitch the statutory national minimum
wage increased yesterday with the transport union threatening industrial
action to win ''at least #4 a hour'' and two unions refusing to drop
calls for #4.15 an hour which are to be discussed at next week's annual
TUC Congress.
The Transport and General Workers' Union set aside a #1m ''war chest''
as part of a campaign to win a minimum wage of at least #4 an hour for
its members.
The union estimates that 300,000 of its members -- mainly in the
catering, clothing, textile, agriculture and retail industries -- earn
below #4 an hour.
Over the weekend, the General Municipal and Boilermakers (GMB)
launched its campaign which will involve demands for a minimum ''of over
#4 an hour from all employers''.
Those high on the GMB target list include clothing companies such as
Claremont Garments, Dewhursts and the Baird Group, all currently paying
#2.86 a hour, the Asda supermarket group, which pays check out staff
#3.67 an hour, and those local authorities whose rates still fall below
#4 a hour.
With less than a week to the opening of the annual congress in
Brighton, TUC officials yesterday put unprecedented pressure on
firefighters' leader Ken Cameron and construction union UCATT general
secretary George Brumwell to drop ammendments to motions inserting the
figure of #4.15 an hour.
TUC general secretary John Monks was said to be ''seeking to move
heaven and earth'' to prevent the figure being retained on the grounds
that if left in it is likely to be endorsed by congress which could
embarrass Labour leader Tony Blair and possibly harm Labour's election
prospects.
Mr Cameron, however, is among those who believe that #4.15 is a vote
winner especially in the light of repeated demonstrations of executive
greed.
Mr Brumwell, meanwhwile, has many low-paid members in the construction
industry where the labourer's rate is #3.68 an hour and he is not
enamoured by recurring suggestions from within Congress House that the
formula could be interpreted to represent a figure as low as #3.60 an
hour.
Both were reminded as to just how vulnerable they were -- Ken Cameron
to removal from the TUC general council (not for the first time) and
troubled UCATT to the fact that it owes the TUC some #400,000 in
affiliation fees.
Severe arm twisting resumes tomorrow when they will be hauled before
TUC officials again in a final bid to agree non controversial composite
motions.

<HEADLINE>Services to review ban on gays. Even talking about homosexuals is big step forward in the forces, says senior officer.</HEADLINE>

THE ban on homosexuals serving in the armed forces could be lifted,
after yesterday's announcement of a comprehensive review.
A team of civil servants and representatives from the Army, Royal
Navy, and RAF will start work this month gathering evidence from all
ranks and visiting several other countries. Their report will be
presented to Ministers in January.
The action was forced on the Ministry of Defence by a High Court
ruling in June which upheld the ban but urged a review of the policy.
The case, brought by four ex-Service homosexuals, was dismissed
unanimously, but Lord Justice Brown refused the applications with
''hesitation and regret''.
He said the tide of history was against the Ministry, and predicted
that the policy would eventually collapse.
Yesterday's announcement was welcomed by gay activists. Stonewall, the
gay rights pressure group, called for an immediate moratorium on all
sackings and all investigations into alleged homosexuality in the
Services.
Liz Campion, an officer facing dismissal from the Royal Naval Reserve
because of her lesbianism, said the review was long overdue.
''The current situation is simply ridiculous. They must recognise that
everyone must have the opportunity to serve their country,'' she said.
''The situation is a farce. I was kept on for six years, even though
they knew I was a lesbian, because I was good at my job.''
Ms Campion, 35, from Newham, east London, is awaiting confirmation of
her dismissal. She has made her final complaint to the Royal Navy
against the decision to dismiss her and expects to hear shortly.
Peter Tatchell, of the OutRage! pressure group, said a truly
independent inquiry was required.
''We know that in the past MoD research on this subject has tended to
ask very loaded questions,'' Mr Tatchell said. ''Service personnel have
been quizzed about whether they would mind sleeping in a bunk or sharing
a shower with a homosexual.
''It seems like an attempt to pre-empt the House of Lords decision in
the forthcoming appeal by the four dismissed lesbian and gay Service
personnel.
''The MoD is terrified that the ban will eventually be overturned and
that it will face multi-million law suits from dismissed homosexual
personnel.''
Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary, Mr David Clark, said: ''This is
obviously a sensible move. As Labour has made clear, however, it is
essential that any review of this kind takes full account of the views
of the Chiefs of Staff.''
Military chiefs have steadfastly maintained that homosexuality is
incompatible with Service life and that anyone found to be homosexual
should be administratively dismissed.
However, some officials believe there could be advantages to a
compromise allowing homosexuals in support areas, while keeping the ban
in the frontline and units where people serve in close confines, such as
submarines.
One senior Army officer felt that people were generally happy with a
review.
''Times are changing and we have to face up to the realities of
life,'' he said. ''Recent court cases, European law and the like, mean
we have no option but to have a good look at our policy.
''It is going to be very difficult. But we have to get this right.
Let's face it, even talking about gays is a major step forward in the
armed forces.''
Britain is one of the last Nato countries to enforce a total ban on
homosexuals in its armed forces. Only Turkey has a similar policy.
Attempts by President Bill Clinton to lift the ban in America led to
the introduction of a ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which appeals to
some military officers as overt homosexual activity still leads to
dismissal.
Tim Hopkins, of the Edinburgh-based Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Centre,
welcomed the review but had reservations about the way it was to be
carried out.
Mr Hopkins said he was worried that it might be nothing more than a
cosmetic exercise.
''On the face of it I am happy that the policy is to be reviewed. What
concerns me, however, is that it seems they are consulting only within
the Services. There are many people outwith the Services who could give
expert advice on the issue.
''It seems reasonable to have full consultation both within and
outside the armed forces before any decision on the result of the review
is made known.''

A BRITISH family on a round-the-world trip by horse-drawn caravan have
paid out thousands of pounds to settle a legal action in Mongolia.
After reaching an out-of-court deal, they are now planning the next
stage of their global journey.
Their ordeal began last April when Mr David Grant, 54, was accused of
blinding a thief who tried to raid the caravan.
He was forced to stay in Mongolia with his children Torcuil, 15,
Eilidh, 13, and Fionn, 11, while his wife Kate flew back to Britain to
campaign for his release.
When the settlement was agreed with his accuser, Mr Grant and the
children moved on to China but were deported because they did not have
suitable visas.
They took a ship to Japan, where they were reunited with Mrs Grant at
the weekend.
Mrs Grant said: ''It was a terrific relief to be with them all again
after so long apart.''
The family, who sold their home in Orkney to pay for their trip, are
now planning the next stage which is likely to be through Canada or the
United States.

GRAMPIAN Police officers are to take part in discussions on the
possibility of introducing a drug testing policy for the force.
The agreement follows a meeting with Chief Constable Dr Ian Oliver,
who last week suggested that employers should consider holding random
tests on their workforces as a contribution towards beating the drugs
menace.
Dr Oliver said he was prepared to introduce such a scheme within his
force, ''not because there was a problem, but to set an example''.
Some officers expressed concern, and yesterday Dr Oliver met
representatives from the Scottish Police Federation, the Association of
Scottish Police Superintendents and the civilian staff consultative
committee.
A statement issued afterwards said: ''It was agreed that the
introduction of a drug testing policy would be appropriate in Grampian.
''The meeting agreed that a working party under the chairmanship of
the force's superintendent in charge of personnel, Stewart Cree, should
be set up to examine the most appropriate method of introducing such a
policy.''
Police Federation spokesman Mr Henk Rennie said the federation had not
agreed to the introduction of drug testing, but to be represented on the
working party that would discuss the initiative.

TONY Blair's 11-year-old son, Euan, began his first day at a
grant-maintained school yesterday in the kind of media spotlight the
press has been advised not to direct upon Prince William at Eton.
He was one of the last pupils to arrive at the London Oratory shortly
after 11am.
Cherie Blair, QC, accompanied her son as they walked through the
gates. Both refused to answer reporters' questions.
The choice of Euan Blair's school caused a row within the Labour Party
over its education policy.
Mr Blair insisted he and Cherie chose the London Oratory School
because it was the best for their son, although it is eight miles from
their home in Islington.
Labour traditionalists resent what they see as a symbolic U-turn in
party policy.
They suspect that the Labour leadership is shifting its position on
grant-maintained schools, flagship of the Tories' education reforms.
Mr Blair's endorsement of the Oratory school (even though he declared
the choice had nothing to do with its status) reinforced their fears.
They declared them confirmed when the Shadow Education Secretary, Mr
David Blunkett, published the party's schools policy paper.
Instead of unequivocally returning grant-maintained schools to local
authority control, Labour proposes to create a new category of
foundation schools.
Mr Blair and Mr Blunkett can look forward to a bumpy ride on the issue
at the party conference in Brighton next month, when many motions
criticise the party's education policy. Most focus on the opt-out issue.
The London Oratory, founded in 1863, is a Roman Catholic school with
1200 pupils and a selective entrance procedure based on interviews.
Headmaster John McIntosh refused to talk to reporters.

A PENSIONER who streaked through Dumbarton District Council's chambers
two years ago to protest about a new housing development yesterday
renewed attempts to expose what she called the ''scandalous'' nature of
the project.
Fully clad, though barely concealing her anger, Mrs Rosemary Thomas,
66, from Gartocharn, paraded an oil painting of the former site as a
council representative cut the first sod in the building work.
Dunbritton housing association is constructing three houses, to rent
locally, in the 0.28 acre spot where a quarryman's cottage, 150 years
old, stood. Dumbarton district demolished the building in 1993, having
endorsed the housing development.
Mrs Thomas claimed yesterday that the development represented the
misuse of a historic site. ''I know we need new housing but it is
unsuitable to cram three houses into where the cottage stood.
''I don't regret what I did and still feel as strongly about things
today. We have lost a very important part of our heritage, which could
have been renovated for an elderly couple.
''I'm brokenhearted really. This is terrible.''
Joining Mrs Thomas's demonstration, community councillor Ian
McGillivray, whose garden backs on to the development, said: ''I'm not
against building but I am against overdevelopment. This is urban
construction on a tight rural site and opens the door to other similar
developments.''
Ms Mary Anderson, secretary of Gartocharn tenants' association,
disagreed. She said the housing would address the problem of local young
people being forced to leave the village through lack of rented
accommodation.
Mr Neil Clapperton, housing association development officer,
maintained that since Mrs Thomas's streak Dunbritton had ''gone a long
way to allay local objections'' by halving the size of the proposed
development and ensuring it would be ''in the vernacular'' of
surrounding buildings.

<HEADLINE>Award of refit deal to Devonport rather than Rosyth smells of a political fix, says MP. Labour demands Trident inquiry</HEADLINE>

THE Labour Party last night called for a full independent inquiry into
''political fixing and financial mismanagement'' over the awarding of
the #5000m Trident nuclear submarine contract to Devonport rather than
Rosyth dockyard.
Shadow Scottish defence spokesman Dr John Reid said he would be
writing to the National Audit Office of the Public Accounts Commission
today, demanding a full investigation.
Dr Reid said that he had been forced to make the move because of his
growing unease over the awarding of the contract. Fears have already
been expressed that the Devonport Trident refit bid may have been set
artificially low to win the contract from Rosyth in 1993.
Anti-nuclear groups at Devonport said last night that a letter they
had received from the Government's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate
backed up claims of budget difficulties and construction delays at the
English dockyard.
Dr Reid said it was clear there were difficulties at Devonport, and he
praised The Herald for revealing that the Government could be forced
into a U-turn on the awarding of the contract due to hidden financial
costs at the yard.
He said it had become apparent that the decision to give the contract
to Devonport rather than Rosyth had been flawed. Reports over the
weekend that the Government could be forced into a U-turn had convinced
him that a close look had to be taken at the whole tendering process.
Dr Reid said: ''More and more the whole thing smells of a political
fix. Ministers had been desperate and determined to put this Trident
contract to Devonport because of four marginal Tory seats in the area.
They must have realised Devonport would have extra costs incurred to
bring it up to standard. This extra cost would have put Devonport's bid
much higher than Rosyth.
''My information is that the Devonport management were planning an
elaborate improvement project, but they had to drop it because it would
have made their bid too high.
''At the time I said there was a political fix, and that is becoming
more and more clear. Congratulations to The Herald, which was the first
paper to highlight the Government may be forced to do a U-turn.
''The Government is now having a review of the whole situation. Even
after that review, I anticipate a fudge on the whole issue of Rosyth and
Devonport. The MoD will say the refit is many years away and no decision
will be taken.''
Mr Kevin Owen, of the Plymouth nuclear dump information group, said
the letter from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate made it clear
that there were still problems at the dockyard. He said local concern
centred on worries that the limestone rock beneath the battleship dock,
due to be converted for Trident refits, would not meet seismic safety
standards.
Mr Owen said: ''The whole question of Trident refits at Devonport
appears to be in some disarray. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate
is now clearly not prepared to license the proposals under the current
situation and does not see the problems being resolved for some time to
come.
''The plans are already behind schedule and are likely to be
considerably over budget, which must raise doubts about the project and
the Government's dockyard sell-off.''
Mr Brian Negus, of the Rosyth dockyard unions, agreed that the
Government had made the wrong decision over the submarine refits, but
thought it unlikely they would change their minds.
He said: ''The then Minister of Procurement, Roger Freeman, said they
would be talking about the refitting contract and the whole
privatisation issue by the end of August. Here we are in September and
we have heard nothing. They should change the decision, but I just can't
see them admitting a blunder that makes it clear they made the wrong
decision.''
An MoD spokeswoman said last night she was aware of what she called
speculation on the Trident contract. She said there was no suggestion
that Devonport would not be fully operational and said any such talk was
pure speculation.

OPPOSITION parties and groups representing single mothers reacted
angrily yesterday to suggestions that the Government might abolish the
lone parent benefit.
The benefit is worth #6.30 a week to single parents, but reports say
it could be scrapped in the November Budget.
Downing Street, the Department of Social Security and the Treasury
described the claims as speculation and declined to comment further.
However, the move would save the Government an estimated #330m a year
and could help achieve the Tories' goal of pre-election tax cuts.
Ministers are also keen to control the growing costs of the welfare
state and total benefits to lone parents have reached #10 bn a year.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar joined the National
Council for One Parent Families and Gingerbread in condemning the idea.
Accusing Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley of indulging in
''scapegoat politics'', he said: ''It looks as if the single parent is
in the firing line again.
''This proposal has nothing to do with moral principle or a more
effective welfare system based on opportunity. Sadly, it has more to do
with popularity ratings at the Tory party conference.
''Cutting the income of a single parent can only add to her problems.
A punitive approach will be totally counter-productive.
''The loss of #6.30 a week will not affect the number of unplanned
pregnancies, but the reduction in income will make life much more
difficult for those who find themselves in that situation.''
The benefit, introduced by Labour in 1976, is the only one
specifically aimed at lone parents.
Mr Dewar warned that the benefit cut only would deepen the poverty
trap and discourage single parents from taking paid work.
The National Council for One Parent Families said 2.2 million children
were being brought up in single-parent families, of whom almost half had
incomes of less than #100 a week.
Its director Karin Pappenheim condemned the idea of abolishing the
benefit.
''We are extremely concerned because this is one of the few
recognitions in the social security system of the special needs of lone
parents,'' she said. ''Clearly, to do away with it would be to hit an
already low income and vulnerable group in return for what are
relatively small savings to the Exchequer.''
She warned that it would affect the minority of single parents who had
actually managed to go back to work, the very people the Government had
said it was trying to encourage.
Kieran Murphy, chief executive of Gingerbread Association for One
Parent Families, said: ''We are very alarmed at this kind of rumour.
''This would be particularly bad for lone parents who are trying to
make that transition from income support into work. That transition is
already almost impossible.''
Mrs Diana Maddock, Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on the family, said:
''If the Government abolishes one-parent benefit, it will be penalising
children whose single parents manage against all the odds to combine
paid employment with looking after their children.
''Taking the axe to single parent benefit will do nothing to tackle
welfare dependency. Indeed, it may even encourage some parents to give
up work.''

FORMER gangster ''Mad'' Frankie Fraser arrived at the Commons for tea
on the terrace with a Tory MP yesterday, brandishing a pair of pliers.
Once nicknamed The Dentist, Fraser served about 40 years in prison for
violent crimes committed during the Kray era, including using pliers to
extract the teeth of victims.
Yesterday, he produced the pliers as he arrived at the House, but put
them away before joining MP Harry Greenway on the terrace for tea and
strawberries.
The pair swapped memories of London's East End and laughed in the
afternoon sunshine as they sipped their tea.
Now 72, Fraser has forged a new career in showbusiness, performing his
one-man show -- in which he talks about his life -- at this year's
Edinburgh Festival.
He joined about 100 members of the British Music Hall Society for its
biennial visit to Westminster, sponsored by Mr Greenway, and said he was
keen to speak to any MPs ''as long as they're not former prison
officers''.
Mr Greenway, a keen advocate of law and order, confided: ''I had no
idea he was coming, but I'm sure he'll behave himself. If he doesn't
he'll be shown the door like anybody else.''
The MP for Ealing North, a former resident of the East End where he
frequented the same boxing club as the Krays, chatted happily with the
former gangster.
He did raise an eyebrow, however, when Fraser told him he had voted
only twice, once Communist and once Conservative, the second time after
his girlfriend, daughter of a Great Train Robber, advised him: ''Vote
Conservative and the mailbags will be fuller.''
Fraser also spoke of his life-long love of showbusiness, reeling off a
list of famous figures he had met, including Liz Taylor and Frank
Sinatra. ''I've always liked music hall and showbiz. All my career as a
gangster, or rascal, I met a lot of showbiz personalities.''
He recalled his last visit to the Commons, as an errand boy for a
chemist: ''I had to deliver medicines all over London, and I had one for
Winston Churchill. When I came here on my bike an orderly wanted to
sign, but I said: 'No, it must be Winston Churchill', and he did come
out and sign.''
Mr Jack Seaton, chairman of the British Music Hall Society, said: ''He
is a member of the society. Whatever has happened has been dealt with.
It's nothing to do with us. He's done his time. That's it.''

THE clubmaster of Glasgow's Eastwood Golf Club and his wife were
recovering yesterday after being attacked by two men armed with baseball
bats.
Harry and Jeanette Christie had just closed up for the night and were
about to start a Chinese meal which had been delivered to the clubhouse,
in countryside three miles south of Newton Mearns.
The two masked men bluffed their way in after claiming they were from
the carry-out restaurant and had made a mistake with the couple's
change.
They forced the terrified couple to hand over a four-figure sum of
money from the club safe and tied them up before escaping.
Club captain Douglas McKinlay said the Christies were too upset to
talk about their ordeal yesterday. Mr Christie, 56, was so shaken he
would be receiving counselling.
The club was broken into several years ago, but on that occasion the
raiders stole cash from gaming machines.
Detective Constable John Ramsay said the attackers were both young men
dressed in dark tracksuits. It is not known how or in which direction
they escaped.

After a first, memorable summer of contentment our Herald babes are
all sitting up, with two making tentative attempts to crawl, writes
Jennifer Cunningham
AT EIGHT MONTHS, our New Year Babes are sitting up and preparing for
action, to the delight of their parents because at nearly a stone and a
half they are getting too heavy to carry very far.
Already their individual personalities are beginning to show. Little
Christopher McGuire now dazzles his admirers with six white teeth
instead of a gummy grin, all achieved, according to mum Joanna, with
scarcely a whimper. At the moment Christopher has the cutting edge, but
the others all expect a tooth to burst through at any moment.
Blair Walker has been teething for weeks, say his parents, with
nothing to show for it. He, however, has a thick thatch of hair,
described as light brown by mum, Frances, and red by dad, George. Over
in Edinburgh, Rebecca Watkin also has lots of hair but an absence of
teeth, while in Stirling, Jordan Wardrope has plenty of toothless smiles
and has discovered the joys of having his own set of babywalker wheels.
Their first summer has been the most glorious for years and they have
all made the most of the long, sunny days, but with autumn a more
disciplined edge is cutting into all their lives. Autumn means nursery
school for the two big brothers, Joshua Watkin and Lewis Walker, and
decision time for all the mothers, whose statutory period of maternity
leave is now up.
Interestingly, because they mirror the pattern of mothers of very
young children throughout the country, they have all begun to work again
but only one has returned to the job she had before the baby was born.
The most committed to her job has turned out to be Susan Wardrope, who
has returned full-time to her transport firm in Stirling, while baby
Jordan has taken to nursery like a duck to water. ''I find myself
wondering how he is getting on while I am at work, but he is so happy
there that I don't worry about him,'' said Susan. She and husband Ian
have made the most of the long summer evenings to take him out for walks
after their evening meal. These fortunate four all have ''new men'' for
dads who enjoy their share of babycare.
Blair's mum, Frances Tyma's plans to return to her insurance job
received a blow when she was told she would have to move to Scottish
Amicable's headquarters in Stirling. She did not want to add such a long
journey to her time away from the children every day. After a false
start with another insurance company, she is just about to join Scottish
Legal in a new role for her in the telemarketing department.
Three-year-old Lewis will have a full-time place at his old nursery,
while young Blair will be in the care of his granny. The other big
change for the family was a move at the beginning of July from their
city flat in Glasgow to a house in Thornliebank, closer to George's
mother.
''It could not have come at a better time for Lewis. He has been out
in the garden practically all summer and is beginning to master his bike
and we even have little friends coming to the door to play,'' said
Frances.
Rebecca's mum, Adele Watkin, has given up her job with Marks and
Spencer but has started childminding. ''It is only two-and-a-half days a
week and it is a little boy who is a friend of Joshua's, so it is ideal.
It gives a little bit of spending money while allowing me to stay at
home with Rebecca and Josh,'' she said.
Joanna McGuire, Christopher's mum, has adopted a similar solution.
Unable to go back to her job part-time and unwilling to work full-time,
she now works at weekends, including a night shift on Sunday, doing
administrative work in her local branch of Safeway, while dad, Sandy,
takes care of Christopher. ''He has been great. Once he gets home at
night I hardly get a look-in with Christopher,'' she said.
One thing all agree on is that the past eight months have flown past.
With Rebecca and Jordan already making their first tentative attempts at
crawling and the others ready for the off, the rest of their first year
will be even more hectic, then it will be Christmas and the milestone of
the first birthday.

Maggie Fox reports from Naples on why air strikes may not be the
solution for Nato
NATO may be preparing a new wave of air strikes against the Bosnian
Serbs, but defence analysts say they are a limited and short-term option
in the effort to bring peace to former Yugoslavia.
They say -- and military officials agree -- that the Western alliance
is walking a thin line between intimidating the Bosnian Serbs and
emboldening the Bosnian Muslims and Croats to exploit their enemy's
perceived weakness.
Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes sent a clear signal of that concern
when air strikes began last Wednesday, calling on all sides to
''exercise restraint'', saying: ''No one should seek military benefit
from our action.''
This fear, combined with the built-in limitations of using air power,
means that air strikes can be of only partial use.
''Air strikes, through the history of air power, have never in the
final analysis been as successful as they were alleged to have been at
the time they were made,'' said Rear Admiral Richard Cobbold, director
of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies in London.
''It was said a long time ago that at the end of the day air power can
hurt, can bruise, can frighten, but if you want to resolve it, you have
to have men on the ground,'' agreed Martin Edmonds of Lancaster
University Centre for Defence and International Studies.
Punctuating limited air strikes with pauses, he said, was ''terribly
short-term''.
Although they are dramatic, air strikes cannot be used completely to
disable an army, the defence analysts said.
''I haven't seen anything that indicates there has been massive
damage,'' said Edmonds. He pointed to the fact that the Bosnian Serbs,
whom he described as ''experts in propaganda'', had said virtually
nothing about casualties.
Nato declines to quantify the effects of three days of air strikes,
suspended on Friday to allow the Bosnian Serbs to ''assess'' the
situation, but many of the weapons in the hills and woods of Bosnia
would be hard to hit by any kind of force.
The cannon and mortars that the Bosnians have used to wreak havoc on
Sarajevo and other targets are easily moved and can be hidden under
trees or in buildings.
''The targets are mobile heavy weapons, and the phrase is 'shoot and
scoot','' Cobbold said. ''They can probably move in less than 30
minutes.''
Even neutralising the Bosnian Serb air defences was only a temporary
success, he said. ''Knocking out part of the air defence system can only
be a partial aim. You don't surrender because your air defence system is
gone.''
Nato says all it wants to do is get the Bosnian Serbs to the
bargaining table.
''Our objective isn't damaging things on the ground -- it's changing
behaviour,'' said Captain Jim Mitchell, spokesman for Nato's southern
command in Naples.
The smoke and thunder of a Nato air raid, dramatised on videotape
handed out by Nato in Naples, is indeed intimidating. ''If it brings
them to the negotiating table it is because of the psychological rather
than the physical impact,'' Edmonds said.
Cobbold said the air strikes were meant to have a psychological effect
on the Muslim-led Bosnian government as well as on the Bosnian Serbs.
''They are trying to give the Bosnians something so they will be
confident enough to come to the table and negotiate.''
This would be the best solution, Cobbold said, but he was cynical
about whether it could work. ''I'm not convinced that the Bosnian Serbs
will do more than make a tactical withdrawal,'' he said.
''Possibly the Bosnian government will see this as a time to get more
arms, more training, more time. They may get more intransigent. . .
while the heat is on the Serbs.''

THE murder of a Scots chicken factory worker whose body was found in a

tonight.
Detectives seeking the killer of 35-year-old Mr Robert Higgins, known
as ''the gentle giant'', hope a reconstruction of the events leading to
the discovery of his body will provide a breakthrough in the lengthy
investigation.
Mr Higgins, of Dalmeny, Midlothian, was found in a disused quarry near
Kirkliston, West Lothian, on May 1 and despite extensive police
inquiries, many appeals, and a #2000 reward offer, the killer has
remained at large.
Detective Superintendent Douglas Watson said yesterday that the BBC1
programme would allow police to show the full sequence of events before
the death.

Papeete, Tahiti
FOUR activists entered the lagoon at Mururoa Atoll, France's main
nuclear test site, today to deliver a letter of protest against the
resumption of testing, Greenpeace and the French military said.
The two men and two women entered the South Pacific lagoon in two
inflatable craft and were quickly detained by French commandos.
''The Zodiacs (rubber dinghies) were detected 300 metres before the
entrance to the passage and intercepted 200 metres inside the lagoon,''
a French military officer told Reuters in Papeete.
The French military said earlier the activists had not entered the
lagoon.
Greenpeace said the four were heading for the office of Vice-Admiral
Philippe Euverte, head of French naval forces in the South Pacific, to
deliver a protest letter.
Spokesman Thomas Shultz said the environmental group had information
that the first test was imminent and had launched the ''symbolic''
protest because it did not have the resources for a major action.
France plans to carry out up to eight nuclear tests between now and
May 1996 at Mururoa or Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia. The first
test is expected at any time.
''We had indications that the first test may happen at Fangataufa this
morning but we did not have the means to cover both Mururoa and
Fangataufa since the MV Greenpeace and Rainbow Warrior are not available
to us,'' Shultz said.
''So, we chose to pick the more symbolic target -- the main test site,
Mururoa,'' he said.
Greenpeace's two main protest ships, the Rainbow Warrior and the MV
Greenpeace, were seized on Friday by French commandos after they entered
the exclusion zone with inflatables and a small helicopter.
Greenpeace has two ships still off Mururoa, the yacht Vega and the
schooner Manutea, but Shultz would not confirm that the protesters had
been launched from a Greenpeace vessel.
Other anti-nuclear protesters gathering in a peace flotilla off
Mururoa have vowed to sail into the 12-mile exclusion zone.
Meanwhile, an Australian delegation on a five-day European tour made a
last-ditch appeal today for France's neighbours to pressure Paris into
dropping plans to resume nuclear testing.
Australia's Pacific Islands Affairs Minister Gordon Bilney, leading
the multi-party delegation, called on Germany and Britain to speak out
against the tests.
''The two countries that play the most important role in influencing
France are Germany and Britain. Our aim is to persuade them to express
their opposition in a less muted way,'' Bilney told journalists.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has stopped short of directly criticising
France, Germany's closest ally in the European Union, over its plans,
despite pressure from Germany's powerful environmental lobby.--Reuter.

BLUR, Oasis, Paul McCartney and most of the biggest names in British
pop came together for Bosnia yesterday.
Bands spent all of yesterday in studios across the country recording a
track for the Help! album in aid of children whose lives have been
destroyed by the war in Bosnia.
McCartney stepped in at the last minute to join Paul Weller and Oasis'
Noel Gallagher on a new version of the Beatles' song Come Together.
Weller, one of the original artists involved in the project, said:
''He just decided to come down on the spur of the moment. It's brilliant
working with him, because I am a big Beatles fan.''
Supermodel Kate Moss and her boyfriend Johnny Depp were also at the
Abbey Road studios to watch the recording session.
Other bands pledging their help with simultaneous recordings at
studios around Britain were Suede, the Stereo MC's, Portishead, the Boo
Radleys, Radiohead, Massive Attack, the Levellers, Terrorvision, Manic
Street Preachers, the Charlatans and the Chemical Brothers.
Artists and production companies are pulling out all the stops to get
the album recorded, pressed, distributed and in the shops for sale by
Saturday.
Initial pressings will be 300,000 copies and it is hoped Saturday's
sales alone will take the record to the top of the album charts by
Monday.
It is hoped to give the album its premiere on Sarajevo radio by flying
a copy into the war-torn besieged city this week.
McCartney said he had already done some work for the War Child charity
which stands to benefit from the album. He added: ''It will just prove
to the people of Bosnia that we care.''
He said that even though someone had just told him it was 33 years to
the day since the Beatles recorded Love Me Do, he had no problems
working with younger musicians like Weller and Gallagher.

Tourists already on Antigua were flown to other islands while those
bound for the island were taken straight to alternative Caribbean
retreats.
''We have managed to get about 50 to 60 people off Antigua and on to
St Lucia and the Dominican Republic,'' said a spokeswoman for Thomson
Holidays.
''We gather the hurricane is a particularly nasty one and we've taken
no chances.''
A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents said it was
thought there had been about 1500 UK tourists on Antigua and that most
had been flown to safety.
But he added: ''There will be some on flight-only deals who could be
difficult to trace, although every island out there has a well-practiced
hurricane drill.''
Royal Marines on Antigua and the volcano-rocked island of Montserrat
helped to batten down essential buildings.
On Montserrat, where the population has been evacuated because of
fears of a massive volcanic eruption, some 50 marines strengthened the
island's hospital and government buildings.
On Antigua, where another 80 marines from the Commando Logistic
Regiment were preparing an evacuation centre for the inhabitants of
Montserrat in case of an eruption, work was under way to protect
buildings.
The destroyer HMS Southampton, which has been patrolling off
Montserrat for several weeks, sailed south out of the hurricane's path.
Hurricane Luis and its screaming 140 mph winds bore down today on the
northern Caribbean. It was expected to lash the Leeward Islands
beginning late tonight, according to the National Hurricane Centre in
Miami.--Reuter.

Stavanger
A STRIKE by Norwegian helicopter pilots today left hundreds of North
Sea oil workers stranded on offshore platforms or flying complex routes
to make it home after weeks on duty.
Thirty-nine of about 100 pilots flying for Helikopter Service A/S went
on strike after talks failed to settle differences over a new contract.
The strike is expected to reduce the company's capacity by about 50%
in the west coast city of Bergen, and by about 25% at its main base in
Stavanger, the centre of Norway's oil industry.
The news agency NTB said the action affected about 400 offshore
workers who are reaching the end of shifts, which last up to three
weeks.
''Some of the oil companies may meet trafficking problems by
redirecting flights to the UK and fly passengers to Norway from there,''
said company spokesman Jan Bengtson.

THE former chief executive of the controversial Student Loans Company
is locked in a bitter legal battle with his wife of seven years.
Mr Ron Harrison, 59, who was sacked in March from the #80,000 post
with the company set up by the Government to provide loans for students,
has been barred from abusing or threatening his wife Elizabeth under the
terms of an interim interdict granted at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court.
The legal battle will continue next week when there is a fresh hearing
of the interdict, and a number of other clauses in a wide-ranging civil
action brought by Mrs Harrison.
Yesterday's hearing before Sheriff Thomas Crone was held in private
but court papers indicate that the interim interdict was granted
following a series of domestic disturbances during which police were
asked to intervene.
The court action was raised two days later and interim interdict
granted which prevents Mr Harrison from molesting his wife by abusing
her verbally or by threatening her and from using violence towards her
at Largs or elsewhere.
A further interim hearing will be held next Wednesday and Mr
Christopher Kelly, of Hughes, Dowdall solicitors in Glasgow, said that
Mr Harrison will be defending the action.
He added: ''The action will be vigorously defended. In the meantime my
client denies all the averments made in the action brought at Kilmarnock
Sheriff Court.
In addition to the main clause in the action, Mrs Harrison is seeking
court backing for her husband to be ejected and banned from the
matrimonial home and not permitted to return without express written
permission.
She also wished him banned from removing any furnishings or
plenishings from the matrimonial home without her express written
consent. Mrs Harrison wants the power of arrest -- which would mean her
husband being held by police if he failed to comply -- added to all
clauses of her action.
Mrs Harrison came out of the bistro she runs in Largs Yacht Haven to
talk briefly to reporters. She said: ''I have been instructed by my
lawyer not to discuss details of the case with you. What I will say is
that I consider this a private matter. I can understand your interest in
it and appreciate it.
''But I would ask you to allow me to conduct my private and business
life in peace and in private.'' Mr Harrison could not be contacted for
comment.
The businessman was appointed to head the Student Loans Company five
years ago and promised that its business would be conducted in an open
and efficient way.
It soon became clear that there were problems as applications for new
loans backed up and many students reported that they were being forced
into unplanned debt.
Mr Harrison went on sick leave last autumn and was replaced by leading
academic Sir Eric Ash.
The Department of Education brought in Coopers and Lybrand to
investigate the conduct of the company and its officers and while they
found no evidence of corruption there were said to be ''errors of
judgment and slackness'' over Mr Harrison's personal expenses.

Brussels
A TOP European Commission economist may face disciplinary action over
publication of a book denouncing European Union plans to create a single
currency later this century, a Commission spokesman said today.
The official, Bernard Connolly, did not ask for or receive permission
to write the book, which calls the single currency plans a ''confidence
trick''.
''Permission was not asked for and not given,'' the spokesman said,
leaving the clear impression that Connolly, who is head of a unit
responsible for economic and monetary affairs, would face a difficult
time returning to his post in Brussels.
Connolly also said French and German monetary officials agreed a deal
during the currency crisis of 1992 under which the German central bank
committed itself to providing unlimited support for the French franc
alone.--PA.

<TEXT>
A DEAL has been struck to ensure that the highly successful Caledonian
MacBrayne ferry service across Loch Fyne continues throughout the winter
months. Last year the Portavadie-to-Tarbert service had to abandon a
planned winter schedule because no suitable overnight berth could be
found at Tarbert.
Tarbert Harbour Authority, which says it needs around #200,000 to
build and install permanent berthing equipment in the town's inner
harbour for the new ferry, has reached a ''temporary agreement'' with
the ferry operator.
First introduced last summer, the service exceeded all forecasts with
more than 19,000 passengers and 4500 cars making the 20-minute journey
across the loch, saving an 80-mile round trip.
According to CalMac's area manager, Mr Andrew Horne, car and passenger
figures for the roll-on roll-off ferry service are already well up on
last year.
He said: ''The service is proving very popular and we are carrying
significantly higher numbers of both cars and passengers. It is our
intention to continue running throughout the winter with either our
existing Island or a larger Loch class vessel, which will allow us to
double to 12 the number of cars to be carried on each crossing.''
Tarbert Harbour Trustees have asked Argyll and Bute District Council
to support the plan to build an extension, though not connected, to the
existing pier to accommodate the Loch class vessel.
A study, completed more than 20 years ago, proved a service across
Loch Fyne was required. But it was only in 1994 that it was finally
introduced.

A 77-YEAR-OLD woman who suffered serious injuries in a handbag snatch
lost her husband two days after getting out of hospital, a court was
told esterday.
The 16-year-old youth who carried out the ''moronic and cowardly''
attack was warned that he may be sent to a young offenders' institution.
At the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, Ryan O'Neill admitted
assaulting Mrs Margaret Hunter in a lane in Lochgelly, Fife, on
September 20 last year.
He grabbed hold of a bag she was carrying and pulled it from her
grasp, causing her to fall to the ground to her severe injury and
permanent impairment. He robbed her of a bag containing food, greetings
cards and a purse with #13.
Mr William Totten, Advocate-depute, told the court that at the time of
the offence, O'Neill, formerly of Forest Drive, Glenrothes, Fife, was
just 15. The incident amounted to a bag snatch with unfortunate
consequences.
The court was told that Mrs Hunter fell backwards and suffered a
fractured shoulder and hip. She spent two weeks in hospital.
The Advocate-depute said that although O'Neill's actions had been
wrong and foolish there was a minimal level of violence involved.
Mr Murdo MacLeod, defence counsel, said when O'Neill discovered the
results of the bag snatch he was distraught.
Lord Mayfield deferred sentence for background reports and warned: ''I
regard this as a serious offence. It may be that the only solution here
is a custodial sentence.''

THE company that produces a fifth of Britain's electricity from eight
nuclear power stations wants to drop the name ''nuclear'' from its
title.
Formed by the Government's forced marriage of Scottish Nuclear and
Nuclear Electric, the new company, to be privatised next summer, will
simply be called British Energy plc.
It has also been confirmed that British Energy will set up its
headquarters this December, with an initial staff of 50, at Lochside
Court, a new office block at Edinburgh Park, on the western outskirts of
the capital.
By giving further details of its headquarters, Mr John Robb, chairman
designate of the new company, hopes to disprove recent criticism,
particularly from the Scottish National Party, that the headquarters
simply would be a front, and that the real decision- making would take
place in England.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said yesterday: ''The very name of the
company, British Energy, and the perception of London as the centre of
gravity, suggests a move will be on the cards.
''At the end of the day, the only person in Scotland who will benefit
from this privatisation is the man who will polish the brass plate on
the door of the company's Scottish office.''
Mr Robb again denied that the headquarters would be little more than a
brass plate. ''It will be the headquarters of an active major energy
group with operations and interests throughout the UK and overseas, and
an estimated multi-billion-pound turnover.''
As for dropping the word ''nuclear'' from its title, he said it was
not trying to hide the fact that it was a nuclear company. Instead, the
title is intended to reflect that, eventually, British Energy will
probably move into other fields of power generation and related business
interests.
''Our horizons, long-term, are broader,'' he said yesterday. ''By
drawing on the management, commercial, and engineering skills and
capabilities of the two operating companies, we are creating a group
with the potential to succeed in the wider energy markets.''
Chief executive Dr Robert Hawley said its core business was generating
electricity, and operating and maintaining plant, and that it would not
be going widely away from that. ''We won't be making Mars Bars or
anything like that,'' he said.
The company will be keen to win contracts abroad, however. Both
Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric have been advising Eastern
European countries how to manage their nuclear plants better, and that
work is likely to expand. In addition, it will be keen to sell the
technology and design of the recently-completed Sizewell B pressurised
water reactor to foreign countries.
The title also means there is no guarantee that any future power
stations will be nuclear powered. However, as its AWR and PWR stations
are still relatively new, there is a breathing space before any decision
is taken on replacement technology.
The older Magnox reactors -- including Hunterston A in Ayrshire --
which are not part of the sell-off, and will be retained by the
Government, will go into a new public sector company, Magnox Electric,
which will be based at Berkeley, Gloucestershire.
Further details have also emerged of the new management team at
British Energy, and it is clear that desperate efforts are being made to
present as good a balance as possible between Scottish Nuclear and
Nuclear Electric personnel, in order to remove the impression that the
marriage is little more than a takeover of the two Scottish power
stations by England-based Nuclear Electric.
Any Scottish ancestry in the Nuclear Electric staff is heavily
emphasised by the company, as is the fact that chief executive Dr Robert
Hawley and finance director Mike Kirwan, are currently house-hunting in
the Edinburgh area.
Nevertheless, despite these efforts, of the four most powerful people
in the company below Mr Robb, three come from Nuclear Electric -- Dr
Hawley, Mr Kirwan, and deputy chairman John Collier, who is to head the
group which will decide into what new areas the company will expand. The
other deputy chairmanship is filled by Dr Robin Jeffrey, chief executive
of Scottish Nuclear.
Thereafter, Scottish Nuclear staff have done well. New company
secretary Robert Armour, director of human resources John Kennedy, head
of legal services Dr Jean MacDonald, and pensions manager Ian MacDonald,
all come from Scottish Nuclear, although it has to be conceded that
these positions are not as important.
Two non-executive directors have also been appointed to British Energy
-- Mackays Stores chairman Peter Stevenson, currently on the Scottish
Nuclear board, and Mr John Bullock, Nuclear Electric board member and a
director of Kingfisher plc.

Tehran
A BRIDE was sentenced to 85 lashes by an Islamic court for dancing
with men at her wedding, a newspaper said today.
The court in the holy city of Mashhad sentenced 127 guests at the
Western-style wedding to floggings or fines and jailed one man, the
daily Kayhan reported.
Iranian police warned last month that weddings had to be organised
according to strict Islamic rules, with separate rooms for men and women
and without dancing or unauthorised music.
The groom's sister was sentenced to 75 lashes for dancing with men and
fined, but the groom was only fined, the report said.
The court jailed the groom's father for 18 months, ordered him to pay
50 million rials (#10,700) in fines and seized some of his property for
holding the party, it said.
Most other guests received sentences ranging from 20 to 85 lashes and
were ordered to pay fines, it added. Only a youngster was
acquitted.--Reuter.

COMMUNITIES should have more input into decision-making in local
government, and a major say in issues that affect them such as housing,
education, and transport, a leading councillor said yesterday.
Councillor Keith Geddes, senior vice president of the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities and leader of the new unitary Edinburgh
Council, pledged his support for the decentralisation of council
services into the community under the local government reorganisation.
Calling for more Government money to support decentralisation schemes,
which all local authorities must have in place by April 1997, he was
speaking in Edinburgh at the launch of an action programme to give Scots
a greater say in policy decisions affecting their lives.
Ms Linda Gray, director of the Scottish Education and Action for
Development (Sead), which has produced a ''Shifting the Balance''
charter, said there was a growing fear among people of a ''culture of
secrecy'' in local government circles.
''It is one of the saddest and most perturbing facts of our times that
growing numbers of people are becoming disillusioned with democracy
because they feel alienated from the decisions that affect their lives.
''Sead believes that actively involving local people in setting the
public policy agenda will make for better policy and a healthier
democracy.''
She applauded Cosla's readiness to support a set of principles which
made heavy demands on local authorities. ''This is not a diktat to them,
rather a set of guidelines which we hope they will find useful.
''It is not a magic wand, but a useful contribution to the debate
among local authorities who have shown a marked willingness to work with
local communities.''
Councillor Geddes said he believed the charter would be of major
benefit to councils throughout Scotland who were currently deciding how
their own decentralisation schemes should operate.

SCOTLAND's new patron saint was annoyed yesterday that his movie on
the life of William Wallace seemed to be in danger of being hijacked by
the Scottish Nationalists.
As he held court in an Edinburgh hotel on the day after the
spectacular premiere of Braveheart at Stirling Castle, Mel Gibson,
Hollywood superstar and movie heart throb, looked a million dollars. He
had partied through the night; but not for him the eyes like road maps
or the Wallace Monumental hangover.
However, he did comment on the fact that his picture has already
appeared on an SNP propaganda leaflet: ''That was not the purpose of the
film. Nor did I give permission for that to happen.
''It's a little presumptuous, I feel. But what can you do about it?
All I can say is that I'm not Scottish and I'm not that well acquainted
with the situation.''
The film, which he directed as well as starred in, was political by
its very nature, he said. But it was the politics of the 13th century.
And there was also a lot of action and romance. It was not intended to
make a political point. It was a piece of entertainment.
''It wasn't necessarily about Scotland. It was about a place where you
see this kind of figure recurring through history. A singular individual
who is extraordinary for some reason or other. William Wallace was ahead
of his time and he put his life on the line for his principles,'' he
added.
So what did he think of the response from the thousands of screaming
fans who turned out to catch a glimpse of him the previous night?
''I really didn't expect so warm a response and something like that is
a great reward to me, to feel that you have that much support from an
audience.
''That's why you work and make films -- for other people's digestion .
. . and they seem to want to eat it. I didn't expect it. I seriously
didn't,'' he said.
He was attracted to the story because it was both compelling and
well-told. American screenwriter Randall Wallace, a man who was ''a
tough guy but who is capable of crying at an episode of Lassie,'' had
given the tale ''a real good heart''.
Asked about suggestions that he had considered ruling himself out of
the role because he was too old to play Wallace, the 39-year-old actor
said: ''No. He was young and died before he was 35, so I missed the mark
by about five years. But you just have to use your imagination. Put a
little vaseline on the lense.''
But was Mel Gibson feeling his age? ''No. I can still do handsprings
till the cows come home. It's just that I'm hoping every year that they
come home a little earlier,'' he quipped.
Asked (by an English journalist) about the clearly pro-Scottish bias
of the film, Gibson said: ''I'm sorry. It does have to have a point of
view and it does have to have a bias. But it is also concerned with the
duplicity of the Scottish nobility.''
He praised the Braveheart cast which included Scots actors Ian Bannen,
David O'Hara, James Cosmo, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen, and
Brian Cox, not only for their performances, but for the way they
conducted themselves during filming.
There had been a complete lack of ego on the shoot and that was
something which was absolutely necessary if a director was to get the
best out of people.
''I suppose a lot of them were intimidated by me to begin with and I
had to cajole them to prove that I wouldn't bite them and that I
wouldn't turn into the antichrist,'' he added.
Gibson's accent in Braveheart -- which sounds as though it came
straight from Govan on a Saturday night -- is not at all bad for an
American Australian (or Australian American?). He said that much of its
success was down to two young members of the cast, James Robinson and
Andrew Weir, who played the roles of the boy Wallace and his childhood
friend, Hamish. ''They were on my case all the time,'' he said.
* The Scotland football team may be fired up for tomorrow's vital Euro
qualifier against Finland -- with a special screening by 20th Century
Fox of Braveheart. Star striker Ally McCoist felt so proud after seeing
the premiere that he reckoned it would be the perfect way to whip up a
patriotic fever.

LABOUR yesterday insisted that local authorities would have a
meaningful role in the government of Scotland if an assembly is
established.
Critics of the proposal for a Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh have
claimed that its formation inevitably would lead to a dilution of power
for local councils.
However, Mr John McAllion, Labour's Scottish local government
spokesman, told a conference in Glasgow -- held by the public sector
union Unison -- that the position of councils would be determined only
after detailed consultation, and with every attempt to reach a
consensus.
Mr McAllion told delegates that he was unable to give detailed
commitments on Labour policy, but defended himself against any
accusation of vagueness, saying: ''It would be unconstitutional, but
also undemocratic and plainly wrong.
''We propose that it will be for a Scottish Parliament to determine
the most appropriate overall structure for local government in
Scotland.''
He said the relationship between the two tiers would be very different
from that which currently existed between councils and Westminster.
''We recognise that, in creating a new Scottish parliament from
scratch, we have a unique opportunity to establish a new relationship
between different tiers of democratic government in this country.''

THE Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, called on the IRA
last night to start handing in their weapons to rescue the all-party
talks.
He said the issue hinged on two phrases: can't or won't.
0 He said: ''It is a question I think of whether or not it is
legitimate to say the IRA can't make any start . . . or whether the
correct verb is not won't.''
He said he believed it was the latter.
Sir Patrick said the obstacle to talks was the refusal even to start
the disposal of paramilitary armaments.
He added: ''People ask 'If there is the political commitment they say
there is, then how come they won't even make a start?'
''It is a really serious question that has to be addressed.
''The commitment represented by and evidenced by a start being made is
certainly enough.''
He continued: ''People won't come round the table to sit down with
people whose friends have refused to make that commitment and give
evidence of that commitment. We are not prepared to destroy the
political progress and process by calling talks where there will be a
large number of empty chairs.
It appeared there also had been a difference of opinion with Dublin
over the issue of decommissioning, with Sir Patrick reportedly angry
over reports that agreement had already been reached.
One report claimed a deal had been done in which all that was required
was a promise by Sinn Fein on the non-use of the gun, without any
weapons actually being handed in.
The talks process already had deadlocked after a meeting between Sinn
Fein president Gerry Adams and Sir Patrick.
It is understood Sinn Fein failed to persuade the Government to set a
date for the start of the all-party talks on the future of Northern
Ireland.
After two hours of talks in Belfast, Mr Adams said: ''We were looking
for a positive response to propositions which had been put to him and
which we saw as enabling everyone to move to all-party talks without
anyone having to climb down.
''Unfortunately, and I am disappointed to say this, he was not able to
respond positively to those suggestions.''
The Northern Ireland political development Minister, Mr Michael
Ancram, and Mr Martin McGuinness, a key member of Sinn Fein's ruling
executive who is due to leave for the US today, also attended the
Belfast talks.
The meeting followed talks in Dublin between Sir Patrick and the Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring as part of preparations for tomorrow's
summit at Chequers when the Prime Minister is expected to confirm the
setting-up of a disarmament commission with Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton.
However, it seems that a final agreement between the two governments
is some way off.
It is understood they are agreed on some sort of commission to deal
with the decommissioning of weapons but it seems London is under some
pressure from Dublin to set a date for substantive talks involving all
the political parties in Ulster.
Mr Adams said he hoped the Secretary of State would re-think his
position between now and the summit.
He added: ''I think it is incumbent on everyone to reflect on how we
can move the situation forward.
''This could well be a defining moment in which the British Government
needs to make it clear that it is committed to building peace.''
Mr Adams said the only way they could develop the peace process was
through dialogue. Thirteen months into the IRA ceasefire and years into
the peace process, Mr Adams accused Britain of gambling with the process
and engaging in high-risk strategy.
All-party talks with every issue on the table were now required, he
said.
''We have to move the situation forward to ensure the peace process
stops being a gamble and starts being a way forward towards a lasting
peace,'' he added.
John Cooney writes from Dublin: The British Government yesterday
rebuked the Irish for weekend media ''hyping'' of the summit meeting at
Chequers.
According to informed diplomatic sources, yesterday's meeting in Dublin
between Sir Patrick and Mr Spring ran into difficulties because of
heightened expectations about the likely outcome of the summit.
The sources suggested that Sir Patrick expressed his annoyance to Mr
Spring about newspaper leaks claiming that agreement had already been
reached on the issue of decommissioning of IRA arms.
The Sunday Tribune newspaper in Dublin had reported that Mr Major and
Mr Bruton had agreed on a compromise which would require Sinn Fein to
give a solemn commitment to take the gun out of politics without
involving the surrender of any of the IRA's weapons.
The report also suggested that the British and Irish governments had
reached an understanding with the United States on a target date in
November for the opening of round table all-party talks.
However, after a two-hour meeting between Mr Spring and Sir Patrick it
emerged that considerable obstacles remain on these two key issues.
The meeting, expected to last an hour and to finalise the communique
for the Chequers summit, resulted instead in some tough talking.
''Some tough nuts have still to be cracked,'' a senior Irish diplomat
admitted last night.
Dublin's approach to the summit has been made more difficult by
pressure from Sinn Fein not to accept British proposals for a tangible
move by the IRA to give up its arms.
The Irish Government is pushing for the establishment of an
international commission to deal with the paramilitary arms issue. This
is expected to be chaired by Senator George Mitchell, President
Clinton's special adviser on Northern Ireland.
As Dublin failed to reassure Sinn Fein on the decommissioning issue,
it appeared to make progress on another front with the announcement that
the leaders of the fringe loyalist political parties will meet Mr Bruton
for talks later this month.
Meanwhile, Mr Tony Blair began his first official visit to Dublin
since becoming the leader of the Labour Party. In an interview with the
Irish Times he said he was not surprised Mr Major's Government has taken
the view that it was essential there was action on decommissioning.

A RAPIST from Glasgow was yesterday sentenced to life imprisonment.
At Lewes Crown Court in Sussex, Judge Alastair Troup told 17-stone
William Stevenson: ''You are an evil man and a danger to women.''
In August this year, Stevenson, 28, was found guilty of tying up and
raping a young student in her Eastbourne bedsit. Sentencing was delayed
for psychiatric reports, but yesterday Judge Troup was told Stevenson
had no mental disorder.
He had tricked his way into the woman's flat by pretending to be a
Christian charity worker. In court, Stevenson claimed to live and work
at a Christian drop-in centre at Ellesmore Street, Possilpark.
The 22-year-old victim felt sorry for him when he sobbed and told her
he had nowhere to stay and would have to sleep on a park bench.
She let him spend the night in a sleeping bag on her bedsit floor but
at 7am the next morning, he climbed into her bed, tied her arms behind
her and raped her.
After the attack he punched her in the face and said: ''Cry, you'll
feel better if you cry.''
Earlier the woman told the court: ''He seemed a really good Christian.
He seemed a nice person. He told me he did a good turn every day and
always said a prayer before going to bed.''
But Stevenson was already on bail for another alleged rape in Scotland
when he travelled to London for the weekend and befriended the
convent-educated woman at Victoria coach station.
It emerged in court that Stevenson had been convicted of three
previous assaults against women in Scotland.
The judge recommended that Stevenson spend a minimum of 12 years in
prison.

THE banking industry last night launched a rearguard action to defend
the way it does business, after a couple who had accused Lloyds Bank of
giving them negligent advice won #77,529 compensation.
Teacher Julia Verity, 55, and her partner, acupuncturist Richard
Spindler, 36, sued the bank after their property speculation venture
failed.
Judge Robert Taylor said at the High Court in Leeds that Lloyds Bank
had been in breach of a duty of care when it advised the couple on a
#150,000 loan they took out to buy and renovate another house in their
neighbourhood as an investment.
He said: ''The claimants' reliance on the advice caused loss of a kind
that was reasonably foreseeable.''
He refused their claim for compensation for mental and physical
stress. They had claimed a total of #500,000.
The Victorian terraced property in question, in Henley-on-Thames, had
been expected to sell within a year for #160,000, but with the collapse
of the market in 1988 it went for #135,000 in 1990. Interest charges
mounted and the couple are still more than #150,000 in debt.
The bank denied negligence and breach of duty, and counterclaims
#115,000 outstanding interest.
The couple said after the case that they could still face bankruptcy
if the counterclaim is successful when it is heard in January.
Mrs Verity said: ''We feel a great deal of joy that we have come to
this point where our truth and honesty have been recognised.
''We have been able to win our argument but at the same time we are
very sad we may be bankrupted at the end of the day.''
The Independent Banking Advisory Service, a consumer group, said the
ruling could help other victims of alleged negligent advice.
A spokesman said: ''As far as we are concerned any case of this type
alters the law. It will set a precedent for anyone who is looking at an
action against their bank.''
But Lloyds Bank, which will not appeal, said the decision did not set
a legal precedent.
It said the judge made clear the decision was ''on the precise facts;
namely that Verity and Spindler had specifically sought advice of their
bank manager on the prudence of the transaction involving the purchase
of a house for development and sale.
''It is standard practice for a banker to give general advice and
guidance, if asked, but to leave customers to make their own decisions
on the ultimate viability of the business proposal.
''In this instance the judge decided that our branch manager went
further, and encouraged the plaintiffs to proceed with their project.''
The bank manager who gave the advice, Mr Maurice Hunt, has since taken
early retirement.

Sarajevo
TIME ran out for Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic last night as the
Nato deadline on lifting the siege at Sarajevo passed, and renewed air
strikes were threatened.
A UN spokeswoman said Serb heavy weapons were on the move, with tanks
and artillery rumbling out of their positions and being assembled at
Sarajevo suburbs. It was possible, however, the Serbs were moving their
weapons to areas with large civilian populations to confound Nato
attacks.
In Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold south-east of Sarajevo, Nato jets
roared overhead as the ultimatum passed. About five minutes later, there
were two explosion-like sounds, although they were possibly sonic booms.
Serb anti-aircraft batteries nearby began firing. Sirens howled.
The sound of explosions was also heard north of Sarajevo, near
Vogosca, the site of a Serb ammunitions factory hit last Wednesday by
war planes.
In a letter to UN commander General Bernard Janvier, General Mladic
had renewed a ceasefire offer and proposed other conditions which the UN
has already rejected.
He accused General Janvier of taking sides against the Serbs. He asked
General Janvier to convene all-party talks on peace, but said before
that he would ''unilaterally declare a cessation of hostilities in the
region of Sarajevo, where we shall not undertake any actions, except in
self-defence''.
Nato warned him he was in no position to negotiate. It does not want
counter-proposals, it wants action on the ground to see the heavy
weapons pulled back from Sarajevo.
''If he doesn't play ball, he's going to get hit very, very hard. That
is the bottom line,'' said UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko.
Both Nato and the UN said General Mladic's proposals in his letter
were inadequate.
The UN, meanwhile, has not waited for the deadline to pass to test
Serb compliance. Convoys of trucks crossed in and out of the capital on
a road opened by the UN in defiance of the Serbs.
US envoy Richard Holbrooke played down the concerns of the Bosnian
government that a pause since Friday morning in Nato attacks had gone on
too long.
''It took us many years to get to this point and I don't think a few
hours either way is going to make a difference,'' he said.
Mr Holbrooke and EU mediators kept up a hectic pace of diplomacy ahead
of Friday's proposed face-to-face meeting of Bosnian, Croatian, and
Yugoslav foreign Ministers in Geneva.
Serb military sources claimed they were holding two French pilots
whose Mirage fighter-bomber was shot down during raids last Thursday.
The news raised fears the Bosnian Serbs could use them as hostages to
ward off fresh air strikes.
Former US President Jimmy Carter, who visited Bosnia last December,
said Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic called him on Monday to say
his forces would comply with the UN. However, with divisions between the
Bosnian Serb political and army leadership it was not clear how much Mr
Karadzic can deliver.

<RECORDNO>976535818</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE new pay plan for health workers, which lifted the threat of
strikes across the NHS late last night, involves trusts being given
power to determine rises on top of a national award.
In return, the unions have received an assurance that the pay of
health workers will be reviewed annually and raised by the national
average.
The new pay structure has been thrashed out between the Health
Department and the unions and trust managers in secret negotiations.
Around 16 unions representing almost 700,000 health workers agreed to
the package, seen by some as a climbdown by the Government.
The deal came just hours before Unison, the biggest health union, was
due to announce the results of a ballot understood to be overwhelmingly
in favour of strike action.
It means pay review bodies retain a key role and will continue to
recommend national pay awards.
In future the nurses' pay review body will recommend rates not just
for nurses and therapists, but for all clerical and ancillary staff, an
extra 350,000 workers.
A spokeswoman for Unison said: ''We think this deal gives us the
benefit of local pay in the sense of being able to increase people's
earnings, and the benefits of national pay which provides minimum
standards below which nobody falls.''

A PAISLEY company is to leave the town following a relentless campaign
of vandalism.
Families in new homes near-by are also living in fear as gangs of
youths nightly tour the area. One family have given up their home and
moved to Inverness.
McLuckie Engineering Ltd, of Barterholm Road, has been in business in
the town for 27 years, but managing director Mr Crawford Wilson
confirmed yesterday he is looking for alternative premises and may move
to Cumbernauld.
He says his works have been subjected to a catalogue of attacks by
groups of youths who are terrorising the area. In the past five months,
one unit has been destroyed by wilful fireraising, windows have been
smashed, cars damaged, fences torn down and a boundary wall knocked
over.
Mr Wilson said last night: ''Enough is enough. This is a desperate
state of affairs. The place has gone plain crazy.''
He has also written to Strathclyde's Chief Constable, Mr Leslie Sharp,
claiming that police are unable to control the situation.
The move follows a standing-room-only public meeting in the area at
which local residents expressed similar fears. Some said they too were
being forced to move away.
Local SNP Councillor Mr Jim Mitchell, who called last month's meeting,
said: ''The situation is getting out of hand. People who have complained
about the gangs have been threatened for doing so. They are living in
fear in their own homes.''
Some of the houses are controlled by Paisley South Housing
Association. Director David Manning said: ''We are aware of the terrible
situation. One family has already moved away because of what is
happening. We are currently looking at ways to resolve the matter
including installing closed circuit television in an effort to pinpoint
the culprits.''
Last night Chief Superintendent Thomas Caldwell, divisional commander
at Paisley, said: ''We are aware of the letter from McLuckie's and the
matters raised are being investigated.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday moved swiftly to dispel doubts over
his commitment to devolution, claiming such suggestions were ''drivel''
and giving an absolute pledge to create a Scottish Parliament with
tax-varying powers.
In an interview to be broadcast today by BBC Radio Scotland, he was
emphatic in his support for constitutional change. ''I have seen these
stories with complete bemusement. They are total and absolute drivel. My
commitment to Scottish devolution has been a commitment as long as I
have been in the Labour Party,'' he insisted.
He appeared to cast some doubt on Labour's negotiations with Liberal
Democrat partners on the Constitutional Convention by adding: ''I want a
system that actually works and these other parties -- the Tories are
completely opposed to constitutional changes, the SNP and Liberal
Democrats won't ever be a government so won't be implementing this
change -- and we have got a responsibility to do it properly and well.
It's because we believe in it that we have to get it right.''
Of the Convention negotiations, he said: ''These discussions have been
going for a very long time and I have not been dictating them.
Obviously, it has to come back to the Labour Party and we have to decide
our own policies.
''But I think people should grow up about this. We are getting bogged
down in arguments about how many people are going to sit in the
Parliament and questions of accountancy detail in relation to the
budget, when you have got a Tory party sitting there that is utterly
opposed to Scottish devolution at all.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said last night: ''Tony
Blair has made clear both his personal commitment to devolution and the
commitment of the Labour Party as a whole. The Convention scheme is
designed to be the basis on which the legislation will be framed. There
is not, nor has there ever been, any doubt over this.''
During Mr Blair's absence from Britain on holiday there have been
persistent media suggestions that his office is behind efforts to weaken
devolution proposals by trimming the financial powers -- substituting
the virtual block grant of ''an assigned budget'' for the more radical
notion of ''assigned revenues''.
It has also been suggested that he was behind the party's negotiating
position which would make a Scottish Parliament of smaller proportions.
''I am astonished by these stories,'' he told the BBC's Good Morning
Scotland.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said last night: ''We are
anxious to get this agreement completed and to get on with the task of
taking the campaign to the Tories. On that we are at one with Tony
Blair.
''Anyway, Tony Blair isn't in a position to say he will deliver this
on his own. He might well need the Liberal Democrat contingent in the
next Parliament to see this through, so we remain the real guarantors of
Scottish Home Rule.''

THE way package holidays are bought and sold is being investigated
again by the Office of Fair Trading, it was announced yesterday.
Last year, the OFT spent many months looking at the holiday industry
to see if consumers were getting a good choice from tour operators and
travel agents before finally concluding that they were.
Now, the OFT is conducting a second investigation and once again
studying the close relationship between some big holiday companies and
top high street travel agents.
The inquiry also will look at the practice of some travel agents who
insist that discounts on brochure prices can be given only if
holidaymakers use the travel agents' own insurance plan.
Thomson, the UK's leading holiday company, owns top travel agent Lunn
Poly while rival travel agent chain Going Places is owned by another big
tour operator Airtours. Thomas Cook, another big high street name, has
links with holiday company First Choice.
An OFT spokesman said yesterday: ''We said we would have another look
at the industry and we are.''
A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents said: ''We
are happy to co-operate with the OFT, even though its last inquiry found
no evidence of a restriction of consumer choice.''

THE Tory party was last night facing renewed internal strife over
Europe, after a senior EU official denounced plans for a single currency
as ''a dangerous confidence trick''.
Mr Bernard Connolly, head of the EU department overseeing the monetary
system for the past six years, warned in a book to be published later
this month that monetary union could lead to war between Germany and
France.
His comments, which shocked colleagues in Brussels, were immediately
seized upon by Tory Euro-sceptics determined to pressure Mr Major into a
commitment never to join a single currency.
Defeated party leadership challenger John Redwood issued a statement
strongly condemning the principle of monetary union.
''A single currency would mean our mortgage and interest rates were
fixed for us by the bank in Frankfurt, not by a British Chancellor
answerable to Parliament,'' he said.
The row threatens to undermine the fragile truce that has held within
party ranks since Mr Major's leadership victory, and once more bring to
the fore the most divisive issue facing the Tories.
Meanwhile, Mr Connolly, in London yesterday for talks with his
publishers Faber and Faber, was facing the prospect that he could be
sacked for his outspoken remarks, having written on the subject without
permission.

THE NHS pay dispute, which had threatened to erupt into widespread
industrial action, was settled late last night after day-long
negotiations.
As exclusively predicted in The Herald a week ago, the settlement
hinges on a compromise between locally negotiated settlements backed up
by nationally agreed minimum pay rates.
The dispute broke last March when the nurses and midwives' pay review
body awarded 1% nationally and suggested further increases of up to 2%
to be negotiated locally. The unions reacted angrily to this attack on
traditional national bargaining.
Yesterday's peace negotiations were held against a background of
mounting union hostility.

Mr Gerald O'Dowd, 31, appeared briefly at Hemel Hempstead Magistrates'
Court, Hertfordshire, charged with murdering his wife Gillian O'Dowd,
nee Malone, at their house in Buckingham Road, Tring, Hertfordshire.
Mrs O'Dowd was taken to West Hertfordshire Hospital bleeding heavily

Needham anger at GEC job criticism.
RMER Trade Minister Richard Needham yesterday promised legal action
against MP Brian Wilson after the Labour industrial spokesman attacked
his decision to accept an offer of a directorship from GEC.
Mr Needham was angered by allegations that he has acted improperly in
taking on the non-executive post with a company whose interests he
defended while in Government. He also announced he would stand down from
Parliament at the next election.
Mr Wilson, a Shadow Trade Minister, accused Mr Needham of ''creeping
under the wire'' to avoid new rules expected to be approved this autumn
by MPs when they debate the findings of the Nolan committee into
standards in public life.
In interviews yesterday Mr Needham, who starts at the electronics
conglomerate next month, insisted he had followed guidelines for
ex-Ministers taking posts in industry, and denied he had acted
improperly.
It was also disclosed last night that Mr Needham is to take up a
second compay directorship. Mr Needham, who also served for seven years
as a Northern Ireland Minister, is to join the board of Ulster-based
construction and engineering company Mivan as a non-executive director.
Labour claims Mr Needham has betrayed public confidence by taking a
job with a company he was involved with as a Minister when he might be
in possession of commercially sensitive information about GEC's
competitors.
Mr Wilson, the Cunninghame North MP, said that by observing a
three-month gap between leaving office and taking up his GEC post, as
recommended by Lord Nolan, Mr Needham had observed the letter but not
the spirit of the law.
''What was the big hurry? He only left the Government in July. He has
been involved in areas of responsibility that clearly impinge on GEC
activities,'' Mr Wilson said.
''Why couldn't he have waited until after Parliament had debated Nolan
and formalised the recommendations and then there would have been an
advisory system for him to work through.''
The public was not willing to accept the idea that an MP could ''slip
effortlessly from a Ministerial seat on to the board of GEC or any other
company'', he added.
On the Mivan move, he said that coming after his GEC appointment, it
confirmed Conservative former Ministers ''see it as their right to
collect directorships like confetti''.
An angry Mr Needham has responded on Mr Wilson's GEC remarks by
threatening legal action. ''Mr Wilson is going to be hearing from my
solicitors. It's not a question of if but when,'' he told BBC Radio 4's
The World At One.
He said the advisory committee would not have considered his case
anyway because it could not act retrospectively, and it was
''ludicrous'' for Mr Wilson to suggest anything would have been
different another three months from now.
He was backed by the Public Services Minister, Mr Roger Freeman, who
said he had behaved ''entirely properly'' and followed Lord Nolan's
recommendations even though they had not yet come into force.
Mr Needham was also defended by Lord Carlisle, chairman of the
Advisory Committee on Business Appointments which governs moves by
senior civil servants from public life to the private sector, from whom
Mr Needham sought clearance for his move.
Last night Mr Wilson dismissed the threat: ''He has obviously decided
that attack is the best means of defence.''
He added that if he was going to sue everyone who has said the same
things as I have his lawyers ''will be fully occupied for some time''.
Mr Needham's connection with GEC stretches beyond his work as Trade
Minister. He was parliamentary private secretary in the early eighties
to Cabinet Minister James Prior, who is now, as Lord Prior, chairman of
GEC.

POLICE in Edinburgh are hunting a man who attacked and indecently
assaulted a nine-year-old girl in broad daylight.
The girl was back at her school desk yesterday as her family said they
were striving to maintain normality after her ordeal. Last night her
mother pleaded: ''Catch this man before he strikes again.''
The incident happened at 3.50pm on Sunday when the child was on an
errand to a local shop. She had taken a short cut along a high walled
walkway linking Edina Place with Norton Park and Rossie Place when the
man, who had a bandage on a finger of his right hand, grabbed and
indecently assaulted her. He ran away after the struggling youngster
screamed.
The terrified girl ran to the home of a neighbour, who called her
parents.
Her mother said: ''She's still a bit shaken up, but she's gone back to
school. I felt that we should try to keep everything as normal as
possible for her.
''We've always taught her to use her eyes and voice to frighten people
off. In that way, her screaming scared the man off.''
The shaken mother also warned parents to be more vigilant until the
man is caught.
A Lothian and Borders police spokesman praised the youngster and said
her screams may have saved her from a worse attack. ''This girl was very
brave, and by screaming in the way she did prevented a more serious
incident taking place,'' he said.
The man is described as between 30 and 35 years old, about 5ft 6in in
height, slim and clean shaven with grey streaked short brown hair. He
was wearing a dark green jacket and blue jeans.

GREATER MILWAUKEE OPEN
CANADIAN Richard Zokol, the winner in 1992, took a one-stroke lead
after the first round over 1993 champion Billy Mayfair at the Greater
Milwaukee Open.
Zokol lost his PGA Tour playing card last year, finishing 169th on the
money list, but he was exempt here asa past winner.
Mayfair arrived fresh from losing the World Series of Golf last week
to Greg Norman in a play-off after missing a five-foot putt for the win
on the seventy-second hole.
Gary Hallberg, the 1987 winner, was one of four players, including
Open champion John Daly who were two off the pace with 67s.
Andrew Coltart, the former Scottish professional champion, shot a
two-over-par 73 over the 6716-yard Brown Deer Park course. Leading
scores (Americans unless stated):
