OUR fantasy flick picker this week is Dr John Paul Leach, who helps
his fellow man by day as a research registrar at the Western Infirmary,
Glasgow, and by night as a stand-up comedian. He regularly presents Scot
FM's Saturday afternoon football programme, The Dugout, and will again
be one of the hosts of the season of comedy gigs at Glasgow's Thirteenth
Note every Thursday from the end of this month.
''When it comes to films, I feel like the archetypal northern
philistine -- I don't know much about them, but I do know what I like.
My favourite films would include The Godfather (I and II combined),
which has better one-liners than most comedy films. Pacino is superb,
and no tale of moral dilemma has ever been better told. I'm also fond of
Ghost, as it's a sign of how parenthood made me a bit more maudlin.
''I'm almost ashamed to admit that Fame is a favourite, probably
because of the televisual candyfloss that it inspired. For plot
intricacy, even more impressive than the special effects, Total Recall
deserves a mention, while Monty Python's Life of Brian merits a mention
for its highly impressive 'laughs per minute' count, beating recent cult
films, such as Wayne's World, by a country mile.
''My Fantasy Film, then, would have to be a weepy comedy of intrigue
set in space, with several dancers, a stand-up comedian, and a false
messiah. Hmmm, a tall order. The director would be Allan Parker,
allowing lots of smoky backlit shots, while Fred Quimby could help with
any slapstick moments. The music would be by whoever did the Pulp
Fiction stuff -- the Shadows with testosterone.
''Male leads would be De Niro, Pacino, and Brian Dennehy (to finally
give him a chance to star in something that wouldn't immediately be
released on video). Hugh Grant would only be involved in the opening
scene, where he would fall victim to Tarantino's special skills. The
female lead would be taken by Emma Thomson, and -- in traditional
Hollywood style -- the other female roles would involve a lot of
simpering, sniffling, and general weeping on demand.
''Gratuitous sex scenes would be permitted -- after all, I don't want
to be involved in a box-office flop. A few kit-off moments should help
to keep general interest up. Actually, very few things would be banned.
With the definite exception of American sports: there's nothing more
likely to bring the disbelief crashing back down than a poorly-shot
crowd scene at the baseball/basketball/gridiron stadium, and the
attendant 'suspense' of the minutes on the clock ticking by while a
life-altering sporting feat unfolds. Soccer isn't much more telegenic,
but at least you're spared the distracting shots of the snail-paced
minute hand.
''I realise that I should at least have mentioned Citizen Kane,
Battleship Potemkin, and It's A Wonderful Life, but I do only know what
I like.''

<HEADLINE>Celtic open all hours in bid to boost share sales</HEADLINE>

CELTIC will today host an open day at their Parkhead stadium in a
last-minute bid to boost the sale of shares in the club in advance of
Tuesday's offer deadline.
The club's public relations officer, Mr Peter McLean, advised
prospective investors to come to Celtic Park in person as it was too
late for the club to send out prospectuses.
Celtic will also host special presentations on Sunday afternoon and
all day Monday, and yesterday the club appealed to fans to stop calling
the share offer telephone lines and turn up instead.
The club hope to raise #9.4m through the share offer, a figure which
was picked to match the total commitment of chief executive Fergus
McCann to the club, said Mr McLean.
The shares, available to fans for the first time in the club's
107-year history, cost #620 a unit, made up of ordinary and preference
shares.
Mr McLean described the interest so far as ''incredible'', saying the
club had dealt with thousands of inquiries.
He was also quick to detail the application of the Greenock Celtic
Supporters Club to be registered for #25,000 of shares.
However, when asked how many of the 8767 units had been sold, he was
unable to supply any definite figure.
He insisted: ''Interest at all levels has been high and we've managed
to sell packages at both the #620 mark and the #62,000 Ambassador
level.''
Pressed by The Herald on the club's expectations, Mr McLean would say
only that it was extremely difficult to predict how well the share issue
would go. He added they did not want to tempt fate by being too
ebullient in advance of Tuesday's offer deadline.
The share offer was launched in December, with Celtic's new bankers,
the Co-operative Bank, offering cheap loans to fans wishing to buy
shares in the club.
However, Mr McLean indicated that only a minority of those who had
taken up the offer so far had taken advantage of this facility, with
''by far'' the majority paying by cash or cheque.
Manager Tommy Burns, and players Paul McStay, John Collins, Pat
Bonner, and Peter Grant have bought shares, with others within the club
said to be considering it.
Mr McLean insisted that no pressure had been placed on them to
participate in the offer.
Club captain Paul McStay described his investment, the value of which
he refused to disclose, as putting his cash where his heart was.
The club will stay open until 9pm on Monday.

THE Hearts board last night launched an attack on former club chairman
Wallace Mercer in response to The Herald's exclusive report yesterday
morning.
Joint owners Chris Robinson and Leslie Deans stated that the
millionaire had taken in excess of #200,000 in management fees and
expenses in the last financial year, and they dismissed any prospect of
Mercer ever returning to the Edinburgh club.
While Mercer indicated in The Herald's report that he may be ready to
return to Scottish football, at no time did he suggest that Hearts were
the focus of his attention.
Deans claimed Mercer, now based in the south of France, had left the
club in ''a mess. If Hearts were any other kind of business, they could
have been out of business.''
Mercer has been cited to appear before an industrial tribunal into the
sacking of former club accountant Gary Hay after the Robinson-Deans
takeover.
Robinson went on to calm any fears manager Tommy McLean may have over
funds to strengthen the playing squad. ''I think Tommy is frustrated
because things are not happening as quickly as he thought, but we're
committed to helping him with any cash that becomes available.''
Last night Mercer was aghast at Hearts' response. ''I was giving an
informal statement,'' he said, ''making it known that I was once again
enjoying my football. At no time was an involvement in Hearts
mentioned.''

SCOTLAND coach Dougie Morgan is under no extra pressure to steer his
side to that elusive victory after nine outings without a win when the
Canadians visit Murrayfield today.
Morgan, who is likely to stand down after this summer's World Cup in
South Africa, was speaking yesterday as a relaxed and upbeat Scotland
side went through their final paces at Currie's Malleny Park on the
outskirts of Edinburgh.
The coach said that although a victory was essential, there had been
no additional pressure from the hierarchy.
However, he admitted that the criticism directed at him had placed a
strain on his family. ''I've taken some stick but I'm at the sharp end
and I know how to handle it. It is upsetting, though, for families when
they know how much work you're putting in.''
He is confident that his losing streak will end today at Murrayfield.
''Those who have come into the big side from the A team are used to
winning. We've got into the habit of losing and it's difficult to get
out of it.
''Maybe they have been trying too hard. Three or four years ago when
we got into the opposition twenty-two, we were scoring, but now they are
thinking too much about having to score. It's counter-productive,'' he
said.
Morgan maintained that his assertion that he couldn't see himself
continuing beyond the World Cup had not affected his relationship with
the players. ''It's hardly been mentioned and in no way does it alter my
commitment to the cause.''
When Canada played England at Twickenham last December, they leaked 60
points, but Morgan does not see Scotland running up the same score.
''We're looking for a good solid win. There's no way that we'll score
even 40 points against Canada. People will look at England's 60 points
and use that to our disadvantage, but that scoreline was not a true
reflection on the game.
''I was at Twickenham and England had scored only six penalties. Then,
suddenly they had three tries in five minutes. If somebody is kicking
their goals like Rob Andrew that day, then you go from being 18 points
down to 39 in that time. We're not underestimating Canada.''
Meanwhile, Scottish skipper Gavin Hastings, who was besieged by
autograph-hunting Currie schoolkids yesterday, declared that the influx
of fresh Scottish faces had parallels with the six newcomers when he
made his debut against France in 1986.
Hastings, who kicked six goals that day to give Scotland an 18-17
victory, said: ''That side went on to form the nucleus of the very
successful team which won the Grand Slam in 1990 and I wouldn't be
surprised to see this side form the nucleus for Scotland in next four or
five years.''
The Scotland captain, who wins his fifty-second cap today, equalling
the tally set by Hawick's Colin Deans and Jim Renwick, added: ''I can't
wait to get out there and show what we can do. It may be a friendly on
paper, but it's a full-blown Test match as far as I'm concerned.
''A win is a must. I don't think that anybody will complain about how
we achieve it, but if we get ourselves into position to use the ball
then there's no doubt that it will be spread wide. You don't pick guys
like Craig Joiner and Kenny Logan on the wing, both of whom are playing
well, and then not give them the ball.''
He added: ''The opposition will ignore us at their peril. Scottish
sides are always at their most dangerous when they're being written
off.''

THE revival of Hearts in the past few weeks has provided Rangers
manager Walter Smith, whose team welcome the Edinburgh side to Ibrox
today, with the evidence to demonstrate what he has been saying for some
time, that it is possible to bridge his side's 14-point lead in the
championship.
Hearts' run has taken them into a challenging position. Smith
observed: ''It is a warning for us and shows that we need to keep an
edge on our play.''
Smith, who has refused an offer from Holland to add Feyenoord striker
Johan van Loen to his staff, will have Basile Boli back but David
Robertson is suspended. ''After the good result against Falkirk, despite
the disruption by injuries, we are now facing one of the form teams in
the league. They will be confident of keeping it going.''
He probably will stick by last week's experimental front line, with
Ian Ferguson and Charlie Miller joined by Brian Laudrup, back after two
games out because of international duty. Trevor Steven is in the squad,
too.
Hearts manager Tommy McLean said: ''There are still financial
restrictions, despite the sale of Alan McLaren and Tosh McKinlay, but
the fans seem to appreciate that it will be a slow process.''
Neil Berry is out and Craig Levein faces a late fitness test on a
slight hamstring injury.
Celtic's flu list has been cleared but a new name has been chalked up,
Charlie Nicholas. Also out is suspended Tony Mowbray but Brian O'Neil
and Peter Grant will be back for the visit to Partick Thistle, whose Rod
McDonald is back after suspension.
Manager Tommy Burns said: ''We know what to expect from Thistle, who
have a good team spirit and will battle for everything.'' Burns, who was
pleased with last week's new partnership of Willie Falconer and Pierre
van Hooydonk, is set to let winger Paul Byrne go to Watford for a week's
trial.
Celtic are to cut prices for the Scottish Cup tie against St Mirren at
Hampden on January 28. Fans who buy in advance can save #1 on #11
tickets and #2 on #15 tickets.
Aberdeen manager Willie Miller, who has eight players reaching the end
of their contracts this summer, insisted yesterday that there would be
no mass exodus. He said: ''Talks are on-going. These have gone well and
will continue throughout the rest of the season.
''The most important priority is to get players who want to play for
Aberdeen.''
The eight are: Duncan Shearer, Scott Booth, Brian Irvine, Stephen
Wright, Paul Kane, Stephen Glass, Michael Watt, and Scott Thomson.
Not on that list is Joe Miller, who still has a transfer request on
the manager's table, but he has decided to put that out of his mind and
help the team to chase a UEFA Cup spot.
Aberdeen will have Ray McKinnon back for the visit to Hibs, who have
both Gordon Hunter and Michael O'Neill doubtful.
Kilmarnock are without suspended defenders Neil Whitworth and Derek
Anderson and also have a doubt about John Henry, who has a cold. In the
squad to meet Falkirk are Mark Skilling and Ray Montgomerie.
Falkirk have been trying to seal a #150,000 deal to sign David Winnie
from Aberdeen in time to have the defender in their side today.
While the board ponder Raith Rovers' bid of more than #100,000 for
him, Dundee United include unsettled midfield man Jim McInally for the
home game against Motherwell. Mark Perry is added to the pool.
United were further boosted when they signed 25-year-old Brazilian
striker Sergio in a #300,000 deal with Portuguese side Amora. He goes
straight in against 'Well, who are on a downer after four games without
a win.

GERMAN tennis suffered another blow to its ego yesterday when No.7
seed Michael Stich was bundled out at the third-round stage of the
Australian Open in Melbourne.
Stich, his country's last big hope in the men's draw, went down 7-5,
6-2, 6-4 to Karel Novacek, of the Czech Republic, following on quickly
the departure in the opening round of No.3 seed Boris Becker.
Stich was upset with his lack of consistency. ''You have good days and
bad days but on bad days you should be able to battle your way through
and win the match,'' he said. ''I am very disappointed . . . but he
played good tennis and deserves to be in the next round.''
The unseeded Novacek had failed to reach the fourth round in four
previous visits to Melbourne.
Only Stefan Edberg and Yevgeny Kafelnikov of the top-10 mens seeds
remain to challenge Americans Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang,
Todd Martin, and Jim Courier.
Of the Americans, Sampras has produced the most devastating form so
far. The defending champion has conceded just 15 games in three matches
at Flinders Park, his best performance in reaching the last 16 at a
Grand Slam event.
However, after having beaten the Swede, Lars Jonsson, Sampras rushed
to hospital to visit his sick coach Tim Gullikson, admitted shortly
before the match.
Fifth-seed Chang defeated Martin Damm, of the Czech Republic, 6-3,
7-5, 6-3 and now faces Oliver Delaitre. France's last hope in the men's
draw, beat Andrei Olhovskiy, of Russia, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.
In the women's event, No.2 seed Conchita Martinez used an ice pack to
nurse a neck muscle injury during a 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 victory over Holland's
Kristie Boogert.

DOUBTS arose yesterday as to which merited the most attention -- the
63 by Colin Montgomerie to take a three-stroke lead in the second round
of the Dubai Desert Classic with a total of 131, 13 under par, or the
design of the clubs he used to produce 10 birdies, the most, by one, he
has had in a tournamount round.
Talking afterwards of the Big Bertha model which he is using in
competition for the first time, Montgomerie repeated his opinion that
the larger-headed irons are effectively a club longer than his previous
set and that they ''really give me an extra club in the bag''. He then
described two shots as justification of that assessment.
At the 550-yard thirteenth he made a 225-yard carry over water with 10
yards to spare with the No.4-iron and at the sixteenth he hit a No.7-
iron 150 yards into the light breeze, stone dead, where before he would
have played a club more.
Montgomerie fired two clusters of birdies -- four in the first six
holes and five in the last six, including the final four successively.
''It shows how well you can play when relaxed and in the enjoyable
company of someone like Fred Couples,'' he explained. Indeed, they were
a combined 23 under par for 36 holes in which they had only one bogey
each.
He added: ''I'm confident and I happen also to be holing out well, but
the leaderboard is strong and I will have to continue giving myself
chances.'' His closest pursuers know all about winning -- Couples and
Greg Norman on 134 and Nick Price and Howard Clark a stroke further
behind.
Noting that persimmon-headed woods are becoming an endangered species,
Couples, who has his own club loyalties, said: ''Manufacturers know what
they are doing, and if a club is easier for an amateur to hit it should
be the same for professionals too.'' He described his 69 as ''an
ordinary score, as good as it could be.''
Price spoke of the new style of irons thus: ''They're ugly, but they
work. I don't like the look of them, because the top line is so thick
compared with orthodox clubs, but then I'm a traditionalist.'' As for
his own 69, containing an eagle 3 and four birdies but three bogeys,
Price thought it a reflection of the inconsistency he expects so early
in the season.
Norman was alone among the leaders to start late, when the hot
sunshine was cooled by a breeze rising from a docile whisper to a
threatening murmur. In a decidedly ragged inward half of 37 he played
the three long holes in one over par and avoided a bogey at the last
only by holing from eight feet after his second shot had fallen short
into the water.
Clark, 40, finished at the ninth with a rare birdie 3 for a 67 which
he described as ''a bit of a rave from the grave''. In fact Clark, who
had the last of his 11 victories seven years ago, was resuming the form
of last season when he earned more than #240,000, the most by anyone who
did not win a tournament.
Holder Ernie Els remained in touch with a second 68 and Bernhard
Langer had the same score for 138, a total compiled without a bogey.
Eight of the 10 Scots had no choice but to pack their bags. Stephen
McAllister, who missed 19 cuts last season, joined Montgomerie among the
69 players who survived the cut at 143, one under par. Sadly Paul Lawrie
bogeyed two of his last three holes and Gary Orr one of his last two for
both to fail by one stroke.

AFTER weeks of calm, Highland League clubs are starting to crackle
with speculation of transfer moves. The player everyone has been talking
about so far was little known six months ago. Wick Academy's Alan Murray
has emerged as a potent striker with 18 goals so far and was this week
at Pittodrie for a week's trial with Aberdeen. The 24-year-old will miss
Wick's home game with Clach today as he has been released to play
against Hibernian reserves.
With his partner Richard Hughes considered doubtful, Wick could be
without their regular front line against Clach.
Champions Huntly, who are three points clear, are at Fraserburgh, a
visit which manager Steve Paterson prefers to the chance of spying on
cup opponents Burntisland Shipyard.

MENTION the last time Clydebank scored five goals, and the faithful
will point to one of those daft days at Kilbowie when Dundee were the
visitors, still with stars in their eyes from the premier division.
The home side won 5-2. The fact that another five sped past Queen's
Park a few days later in the B&amp;Q Cup was treated with slightly less
surprise, because hope was springing eternal that Kilbowie's great
unpredictables were again on the march.
Wrong again, lads. History shows, for example, that Bankies are on a
run of 11 games without a win. But hold on. Dundee will present their
visiting card again today -- hard on the heels of their first defeat in
a while last week to Airdrie.
The circumstances are different this time. Clydebank need the three
points to start climbing clear of the relegation zone. Dundee need them
to prove that last week's poor showing was an one-off. No bets please,
especially since Bankies have not been playing all that badly recently,
and Dundee will welcome back Neil Duffy and Morten Wieghorst.
With Airdrie idle -- they play Ayr United in midweek -- Dunfermline
have the chance to ease clear in second place when they face Hamilton at
East End Park.
Manager Bert Paton still has keeper Ian Westwater on the injury list,
which means that for the second game in a row, he will not have a
reserve keeper on the bench. And with skipper Norrie McCathie suspended,
and injury worries over Hamish French and Marc Millar, the stylish
Accies -- even with striker Paul Chalmers doubtful -- could be quite a
handful, especially with the prospect of playing for places against
Rangers in the Scottish Cup next week.
Raith Rovers are going for their sixth straight victory when they
visit bottom-club Stranraer. But with the Stair Park club battling for
every point in the relegation zone, and Rovers missing the suspended
Colin Cameron, Shaun Dennis, and Ally Graham, a point apiece looks on
the cards.
St Mirren also are keen to ease clear of the fight at the foot of the
table, but they face the difficult trip to Perth to meet a St Johnstone
side who still have not given up hope of gaining one of the two
promotion places to the premier division.

AILEEN McGillivray, who set new Scottish national and native marks for
60 metres last weekend, will be chasing another record tomorrow in the
Scottish Indoor Athletics Championships at the Kelvin Hall.
The Falkirk building society clerkess was timed at 7.39sec last
Sunday, a day before the UK team to face Russia was selected. Despite
having run one hundredth faster than Stephanie Douglas this year, and
despite the selectors having been made aware of that, the Edinburgh
Woollen Mill athlete was omitted from the British team announced on
Wednesday.
''Douglas, and the other girl chosen, Paula Thomas, were running rings
round me last year, so I can't complain,'' said McGillivray who went to
the Commonwealth Games but ended up on crutches without competing.
''I've had two nightmare years, with illness and injury. Last year I
seemed to pull just about every muscle in my body. But I'm fine now, and
if I get my head right, I'm confident I can do well, and be back in the
British team to face France.''
McGillivray declined a 200m run against Russia, but has been given a
guest lane in the 60m. ''So I will have the chance to make my point over
Stephanie. The tight bends indoors were the start of my injury problems
last winter. That's why I'm racing only 60m indoors this winter.''
She will not have an easy task in taking the title. City of Glasgow's
Mel Neef was just .04 behind last week, and the pair are rivals again.
Neef also runs the 200m.
Brian Whittle, stretchered off during the men's 200m at the national
championships two years ago -- his last indoor race -- will not tackle
that distance against comeback man Solomon Wariso. ''I won't risk it on
these bends,'' said Whittle. ''I'm just back from Spain. I'm fit, sharp,
and plan to do the 400m. I'd like to get the championship record (47.26)
back into Scottish hands.''
Eight English entrants have best outdoor times which surpass the
championship record. These include Guy Bullock, who faces Whittle in the
400m for Britain a week today.
* PHIL Mowbray, the 21-year-old maths student who makes his senior UK
debut over 3000 metres against Russia a week today, has been forced to
reject Scotland's call for the Celtic Nations' cross-country match at
Irvine Beach Park on February 5.
Mowbray has opted for the British Universities' Sports Federation
Championships 24 hours earlier. ''It's too many tough races close
together,'' said Mowbray, ''and I promised to run BUSF for Edinburgh
University in Manchester on February 4.'' Loudoun Runners' open meeting
will be held in conjunction with the international. Scots teams as
chosen:
Under-17: M Coombe (Teviotdale), A Ford (Edinburgh AC), J Hendry
(Springburn), S South (Cambuslang). Under-20: S Cook (Inverness), M Bain
(Stornoway), D Roache (Clydesdale), D Connolly (Shettleston). Under-23:
P Mowbray (Hunters Bog Trotters), A Moss (Fife), L Richardson (Irvine) M
Gill (Cambuslang).

EAST Fife's away record leaves a lot to be desired -- 10 goals
conceded and none scored on their past three league travels -- but they
are keeping the home fans happy. The Fifers have hit 12 goals in four
straight wins at Methil, where today's visitors are the leaders,
Stenhousemuir.
'Muir go into the second division's match of the day with Max Christie
added to midfield. Steve Archibald could introduce recent signing Alex
Hamill to the Fife squad.
Dumbarton also are proving formidable on home soil, with 13 goals in
three successive wins at Boghead. They are without Martin Melvin for the
visit of Stirling Albion, who drew at Boghead before winning the cup
replay 3-0.
Clyde won 2-0 at Dumfries recently but had to fight back from 0-2 for
a 2-2 draw the last time they met Queen of the South at Broadwood. Clyde
wait for veteran George McCluskey while the visitors add Brian McKeown
and Steve Mallan.
Morton add Derek McInnes for the visit to Meadowbank but Berwick have
to do without John Gallagher and Mark Wilson for some time, and not just
today's visit to Brechin.
Alloa can open up the third division's promotion race if they can beat
leaders Forfar, who have scored only eight goals away from home.
East Stirlingshire's match with Ross County has been switched to Firs
Park. 'Shire may have Mungo McCallum back while County, unbeaten in
seven games, wait for top scorer Jamie McPherson but have midfielder
Robbie Williamson back from suspension.
Albion Rovers will introduce more youngsters for the home game against
Montrose, who won 5-2 at Coatbridge in the Cup. The visitors have Innes
McDonald suspended, as is Rovers' Lee Collins.
Queen's Park, who held Morton for three hours over two matches in the
Cup, add David Graham and Simon Black for the visit of Caley Thistle,
whose player-manager Sergei Baltacha is among five players who are
doubtful.
Cowdenbeath's Brian Malloy is suspended but they will include Mark
Yardley. He has scored five goals already this season against Arbroath,
who are seeking a home win at the tenth attempt this season.

DENNIS Taylor bowed out of the world snooker championship in Blackpool
last night and then criticised the qualifying format, which gives lower
qualifiers more matches to become used to the conditions.
The 1985 champion lost 10-2 to Welsh youngster Anthony Davies and will
miss the finals for the first time since 1977.
Sauchie's Billy Snaddon will be back at Sheffield for a second year
after having beaten veteran Doug Mountjoy, while Wishaw's John Higgins
earned a first-round tie against Alan McManus. Other results included:
A Robidoux (Can) beat J Woodman (Eng) 10-3; N Gilbert (Eng) beat S
James (Eng) 10-6; S Lee (Eng) beat T Knowles (Eng) 10-4; D Harold (Eng)

NICK Faldo, after another uneasy patch during which his putts failed
to drop, scored a second 70 on the 7148-yard, par-72 National course in
the $1.25m Northern Telecom Open to qualify comfortably on a 36-hole
total of 140 here in Tucson, Arizona, yesterday.
''I had no luck on the greens for a second day running,'' Faldo said.
He missed a birdie four-footer on the first green and turned in 35 with
only one decent putt, a birdie six-footer at the 440-yard ninth. After
three putts at the tenth, he sank birdie putts of 20 and 12 feet at the
short twelfth and seventeenth.
He was nine shots behind leader, Phil Mickelson, who won the event in
1991 as an amateur. Leading scores:
131 -- P Mickelson 65, 66.
132 -- J Gallagher 68, 64.
133 -- P Stankowski 67, 66; B Ogle (Australia) 68, 65.
134 -- S Simpson 69, 65.
135 -- J Ozaki (Japan) 68, 67; H Twitty 66, 69; Bob Tway 70, 65.
Others included: 140 -- N Faldo (Britain) 70, 70; J Parnevik (Sweden)
71, 69. 148 -- J Daly 79, 69. 150 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 81, 69.
* SCOTT Henderson remained in contention after a one-under-par 71 in
the second round of the ICL International in Verwoerdburg, South Africa,
yesterday. The Scot's 138 aggregate left him two behind joint leaders
Tony Johnstone, of Zimbabwe, South African Ashley Roestoff, and American
Ray Freeman.
* LPGA veteran Chris Johnson shot a four-under 68 yesterday to take a
two-shot lead over Meg Mallon and Cathy Johnston-Forbes after the
opening round of the $450,000 HealthSouth Inaugural in Orlando.
Seven players on 71 included Swedes Helen Alfredsson and Lisolette

Ebenezer Erskine regrets there is one rule for badly-behaved ministers
and no rule for elders who make themselves a nuisance.
THE following story is set in a rural village church in Scotland a few
years ago. A meeting of the Congregational Board was being held. The
previous meeting had been slightly tense, especially when Fergus Ford
had tendered his resignation as treasurer and stormed out of the
meeting. Fergus was a powerful man. Powerfully built and over 6ft in
height, he was bullish in appearance and a bully by nature. He and his
family ran the kirk in Auchenbogle.
Out of a kirk session of eight, Fergus was clerk and his father and
uncle were the senior elders. His brother-in-law, also an elder, was
clerk to the board and his wife was church organist and ran the Sunday
School. They got no trouble from the aged minister, who was edging
closer each year to retirement. When he left, a young minister came to
Auchenbogle and all remained sweetness and light -- for a year, anyway.
The new man then took it into his head that he would supplement the
twice-yearly Auchenbogle Communion with another at Easter.
The kirk session (alias the Ford Family at Prayer) agreed it was worth
a try but with one exception. Fergus dissented. He and his family would
not be there, he declared. His reason? Easter is a time to be joyful --
whereas Communion is a time to be sad.
The young minister went ahead -- and lived to regret it. Every kirk
session meeting after that became a battle between Fergus and the
minister. Fergus failed to win backing for his dissents and outside,
when the meetings were over, he would berate his family for treacherous
and spineless behaviour. His last card was to resign as clerk, thinking
they would ask him back and strengthen his position -- but they didn't.
He withdrew his financial covenant and resigned as treasurer, in a final
attempt to forde the minister into line. He had not reckoned with the
fact that a gifted businessman who had recently come to live in the area
was willing to take the job and was immediately proposed by the minister
to take his place.
The shock of having to admit a stranger to a key position in the kirk
brought home to the rest of the Fords that unless they did something
drastic, the kirk they had run for generations would soon be in alien
hands. Prior to the next meeting of the Congregational Board, Fergus
went to see his successor as session clerk, a prominent farmer who was
married to a cousin of the Fords.
When the kirk demanded a larger contribution from Auchenbogle for
wider work, he had opposed it on the grounds that it would go to ''a'
they fowk wi black faces that aren't grateful onywey''. This man used to
have an effective way of bringing the tenants of his cottages into line
if they dissented. He threatened to cut off their water. But blood is
thicker than water, and together he and Fergus explained to the clerk to
the board that if the minute of the last meeting omitted to mention
Fergus's resignation, then all might be saved.
The board assembled with the ''new'' treasurer sitting in the back pew
and the minute was read of the previous meeting. No mention was made of
Fergus's resignation, far less the appointment of a successor. The
minister coughed and pointed out that he was in an embarrassing
position. The minute was not correct. At this point, the session clerk
delivered the Ford ultimatum. ''Nevertheless, Mr Moderator,'' he began,
''I propose that Mr Fergus Ford carry on as treasurer until the end of
the year.''
''I'm sorry,'' said the minister, ''but that motion would not be in
order. The decision at the last meeting was . . .'' He was interrupted
by a roar. ''In all my 30 years as an NFU council member, I've never
been ruled out of order,'' he bellowed as his fist smashed down on the
pew in front.
The crack in that pew can be seen to this day, truly a benchmark of
yesteryear. The end of the story is that the new treasurer did take
over, but the new minister left soon after that, fed up with playing
toreador to Fergus's bull. Today, Fergus is now the presbytery elder.
That, of course, is not his real name nor Auchenbogle a real place, but
all other details of the story are accurate. The tragedy is that they
are not unusual among Protestant churches. There are hundreds of
congregations with a Fergus and dozens with a Ford-style dynasty.
Of course, as well as black bull elders there are black sheep
ministers who can scatter the flock as quickly, and several have
featured in this column, but the reason we have brought this story to
your attention is because it illustrates a strange paradox within
Protestantism. Namely that a minister who behaves badly, fails in his
duty, or empties his kirk, is dealt with (sooner or later), but a
dissident elder escapes responsibility.
Twenty years ago an elder in Lanarkshire was deposed for having
undergone a second baptism. But this was done on doctrinal grounds and
was an exception. The rule is that there is one rule for badly-behaved
ministers and no rule for elders who make themselves a nuisance meeting
after meeting by complaining, dissenting, or challenging the minutes of
previous decisions with which they disagree.
Where two or three such people are gathered, there is hell to pay. It
is said that it only takes a dozen terrorists to hold a society to
ransom but by exploiting the alleged democracy of Protestantism it only
takes a couple of such types to hold a congregation to ransom. You will
not see many such cases being given publicity for several reasons. The
first is that ministers are reluctant to confront the problem. They
resemble the battered wife who is not quite sure that deep down
everything is not all their fault and anyway, does not Christianity
demand turning the other cheek?
Other members of the church are embarrassed to do anything. If the
dissident is at odds with the minister, why get involved? Is it not
sensible to keep your head down if there is a fight, and not to get
involved? If the situation is bad enough and lasts long enough, the
minister will get rattled. He is only human and will make a mistake.
Then there will be faults on both sides and everyone will begin to
forget what the original conflict was all about. It will become a blood
sport in which to cheer on your side -- black bear (minister) v black
bull (elder).
We could cite more instances of elders who have made mayhem and if you
wish to encourage us, we will. But the point of this article is to draw
attention to the fact that nothing is ever done to stop or remove
troublemakers if they have become officebearers or elders. In the C of S
it takes a court of inquiry by his peers before an elder can be
arraigned (not something which is undertaken lightly, since the
aftermath may be even more horrendous).
The presbytery, with whom ultimate authority lies, is reluctant to
interfere, since in any congregation there is usually a strong
undercurrent against outside interference and this might spawn more
dissent.
Fergus and his ilk, ordained for life, are unlike dissident back bench
MPs who occasionally have to face their constituents. For a Prime
Minister there is the possibility of reshuffling the Cabinet to exclude
those who refuse to accept collective responsibility, but for the parish
minister no such option exists. In some kirk congregations, elders serve
for a fixed term and then rotate (a prevalent scheme in the US), but
alas it is the congregations which need such a scheme the most which
refuse to adopt it.

George Hume, a man who has long been acquainted with quality,
discovers a beast of the fields that will take some beating.
ONCE upon a time there was dry ice wreathing swimsuit-clad girls
draped across a bonnet or boot -- all the razzmatazz of an old-style
launch where new models were floated on a sea of champagne and that was
just the cars. Today it is the by-invitation-only breakfast and the
satellite-beamed soft sell that set the pace: dry ice blown away and all
women present power-dressed. We are talking big bucks here and those who
have them . . . or the press.
Which is how I came, on your behalf, to find myself driving . . . no,
not a car or a status symbol, neither family transport nor people mover.
What I was in charge of was #39,195 worth of vehicle, delivery and
numberplates included, as well as one year's road tax and, not
forgetting the VAT man, #5732.70p to the Exchequer. Oh, and there were a
few odd extras and fuel in the tank. It looked like a 4-litre Range
Rover SE automatic to me but according to the adman for Land Rover what
I was so stylishly running around in was a ''facilitator''.
As you may know if you watch Channel 4 adverts it is a new Range
Rover, still recognisably the old Range Rover which in turn means it is,
at heart, a Land Rover -- and you can't say better than that. Smooth as
the men in the car showroom the Range Rover may be, as full of promise
as a double-glazing salesman, but beneath the shiny skin and svelte new
outline it is unquestionably still The Best 4 x 4 by Far. Better than a
birl on the bus, even more thrilling than the Clockwork Orange, Range
Rovering should carry a Government health warning -- try it just once
and you will never be the same again.
I have been driving Solihull's Finest for most of the time they have
been coming off the assembly line, almost since I was able to list
''hexagonal off-set ring spanner'', have owned six and still run one.
Thus I am long acquainted with quality. But this new beast takes some
beating. I was so impressed on my afternoon out to Helensburgh that I
forgot even to note the position of the ashtray and am thus unable now
to level that most devastating criticism of the motoring press -- ''the
ashtray was awkwardly set''.
I admit to having driven with a smirk, my brow clouding only
momentarily as I thought of what the monthly payments would be if I were
putting my money where my ambition was -- swaddled in leather with the
obligatory five centimetres of walnut trim to make the point British
Built. Apart from a quick buzz through Glasgow's West End I did not
introduce the Range Rover to the rough, well knowing what they can do
off road and what my nerves can stand.
How does one market a car -- even a car that the admen choose to call
a ''facilitator'' -- which can carry a price tag of up to #45,000? Step
forward Bill Lancaster, an advertising guru who speaks the jargon we
expect admen to speak. It was he who put seven three-minute adverts on
your Channel 4 screen -- and only your Channel 4 screen -- one a night
for a week. Actually one of them ran out at 3[1/2] minutes.
''They were shown in bespoke breaks . . . very finely targeted . . .
unprecedented footage . . . aimed at people who are very light ITV
watchers, people who really cherry-pick on the best programmes,'' says
Mr Lancaster before shifting into low-ratio gear and putting in the
diff-lock. ''EastEnders delivers the numbers but not the spenders.''
The effect of this unusual advertising blitzkrieg was, says Mr
Lancaster, ''excellent, the same as a normal 30-second slot over a four
to six-week campaign shown nationwide on every commercial channel''. How
had Land Rover management coped with his scheme for making television
ads by carving up 100 hours of world-wide footage specially shot for the
satellite launch of the car into dealers' showrooms in 57 countries?
''They had no difficulty with the idea but everything we do with this
bunch of guys at Solihull is exciting. Channel 4 were tremendous too,
were quite austere with their costs'' -- which means, apparently, a sum
of under half a million pounds for the air time. To a roll-call of
celebrities who were shown in the television adverts -- Francis Ford
Coppola, Prue Leith, David Puttnam, Viscount Linley and others, none of
whom being as Mr Lancaster puts it ''rent-a-face'' people -- the man who
claims to have set the new Gold Standard for car adverts says of the
Range Rovers he put on screen for Channel 4's cherry pickers: ''These
are not lumps of metal -- they are facilitators.''
Besides which they are, honestly, jolly good cars.
* The Range Rover used in the test drive was provided by Gaulds of
Glasgow.

NATIONAL Hunt followers should make the most of this afternoon's
meetings because it is unlikely they will see another jump race until
Wednesday at the earliest.
Hopes of yesterday's meeting at Kempton disappeared into the mud, and
now heavy rain has forced the stewards at Newton Abbot to call off
Monday's meeting.
However, despite the abandonment of yesterday's card, officials at
Kempton are hopeful that this afternoon's fixture will go ahead, and the
track will be checked at 7am this morning.
There are no reported problems for the other two turf meetings
scheduled today.
But prospects for Tuesday's jumps meeting at Leicester are grim.
Clerk of the course Nick Lees said: ''We had three-quarters of an inch
of rain yesterday, and the course is really waterlogged.

I SAW Raymylette last month when he won in impressive style, and I
cannot oppose him for the Peter Marsh Chase at Haydock this afternoon.
He powered up the final hill with great strength, and although
challenged on the run in, he fought back with great determination to win
well.
Nicky Henderson's star is now unbeaten in four runs over fences and in
his wins this season he has shown improved form against the clock. He
can score again today.
Jodami was unlucky to slip when going well last time out, but he is
likely to be well anchored by top weight on today's going, and Monsieur
Le Cure looks the bigger danger after having shown steady improvement in
his three runs this season.
Relkeel has landed a string of victories without looking seriously
challenged. All those wins were against moderate opposition and today he
may have to dig deeper to see off Flakey Dove, the champion hurdler, but
my money will be on him confirming his claims to be in the top class of
current hurdlers.
This week's downpour has produced quagmire conditions at Kempton,
where the day's racing hinges on an early inspection. If the meeting
goes ahead, Trying Again looks set to runaway with the inappropriate
Lanzarote Hurdle.
David Gandolfo brought his charge back from a 12-month lay-off to beat
Kadastrof over today's course and distance on Boxing Day, and next time
out he won again, leaving Keep Me In Mind struggling through the Exeter
mud. Redeemyourself is also unbeaten this season, but should not be
strong enough for Trying Again.
Nirvana Prince looked a promising novice last term when he won four of
his five races, his victims including Scottish champion Corrouge. A
throat infection prevented him showing his true form in his first two
runs this season, but he showed renewed promise until falling at
Cheltenham last week.
He should be suited by a slower pace in the Bic Lady Shaver Hurdles
and can return to the winner's enclosure.
Len Lungo's Nawrik hit form last time out against Pims Gunner and can
reverse the placings with that rival in Catterick's Leeming Chase.

THERE is a happy land. But for too long now it has seemed far, far
away. For Gavin Hastings and his recast Scotland side the hard trek back
to the blessed realm of rugby respectability begins today at
Murrayfield.
Canada are the visitors, and the stage is set for a bold blue line to
be drawn under a sequence of nine games without a win. A victory today
is essential if Scotland are to embark upon positive Five Nations and
World Cup campaigns.
The win, the whole win, and nothing but the win is the only result
capable of restoring the faith. And strange as it may seem against
opposition which, under the old order, would have been viewed as worthy
but eminently beatable, today is one of the most important in the
126-year history of the international game in Scotland.
The singular importance of the occasion is not lost on the Scottish
captain, who today equals the Scottish cap record of 52 appearances.
Hastings said: ''This game is as big a match as we will play in the Five
Nations' Championship. We consider that we have five matches in this
year's campaign.
Nine games without a win -- the losing sequence interrupted only by a
draw against the Irish last season -- is a heavy cross to bear and the
Scottish rugby hierarchy of skipper Hastings, coach Dougie Morgan and
manager Duncan Paterson have been subjected to a welter of ''advice''
from all quarters.
The manager and coach have already indicated that they will demit
office after this summer's World Cup in South Africa. But, say some,
today's clash with Canada represents a couple of pints in the equivalent
of rugby's Last Chance Saloon. Maybe.
Like the coaches and manager, Hastings has been on the receiving end
of much criticism but, he maintains, the pressure has not been getting
to him.
''If you don't read the papers then you don't know what people are
writing about you. I may not agree with it but I'm certainly not going
to add fuel to the fire. I react positively to the criticism and I will
go out and show my detractors that I do still have something to offer on
the playing field. The respect that I have amongst the players and the
coaches and management is the thing that's most important to me,'' he
said.
That old adage about today being the first day of the rest of your
life is one to which Hastings obviously subscribes and he claims to have
filed the horrors of Scottish rugby's recent past in a memory bank
labelled ''forget for now.''
He does not wish to dwell on Scotland's last Murrayfield appearance --
a painful 34-10 defeat by the Springboks -- and, no doubt assisted by
the sports psychologist enlisted to aid the Scottish cause, has focused
totally on today's job in hand.
''From a team perspective we have to understand the significance and
the importance of the occasion, and make no mistake, that will happen.
Individually, I understand how important it's going to be for me to
generate a positive lead from full-back.''
The team Hastings leads today shows nine changes from that which
succumbed to the Springboks. The injury to Bristol prop Alan Sharp and
the enlistment for a first cap of Bath's Dave Hilton means that 10
''new'' faces but only two cap debutants -- Stewart Campbell and Eric
Peters -- are entrusted with the task of shedding the losing habit.
Even more significantly, the majority of today's side, recruited from
the successful A team, are used to winning, a point not lost on the
Boroughmuir tighthead prop, Peter Wright.
A Lion in 1993 who was recalled to Scottish colours from the shadow
side, despite being out of favour with the Edinburgh District selectors,
Wright observed: ''Losing becomes a habit. There was a great attitude in
the A team. Even when we had won, we were always critical of our
performances.''
The crop-haired prop has been in rampaging form for Boroughmuir and
must now translate his club form to the altogether more searching
environment of the international arena.
Scotland expects a big game from Wright today and, similarly, Rob
Wainwright will be expected to duplicate his sterling work in last
year's Calcutta Cup match. The old hands -- a re-born and slimline
Damian Cronin, Craig Chalmers, Kenny Milne and the skipper himself --
must shoulder responsibility and allow the newcomers in the side to
blossom, while Gregor Townsend, in the unaccustomed role of outside
centre, must start turning early promise into hard fact.
Canada, meanwhile, come to Murrayfield with the reputation of an
emerging rugby nation which has all but arrived. During the 1991 World
Cup, I saw them announce that arrival in emphatic fashion on a
rain-lashed Sunday in Lille. In a superb quarter-final clash, they
rattled the All Blacks but lost 26-13. Their majestic second-half
performance moved coach Ian Birtwell to observe that it had been ''the
greatest 40 minutes in Canadian history.''
That same year they did for understrength Scotland 24-19 in New
Brunswick, but recent losses -- 60-19 v England and 28-9 v France --
have taken some gloss of the Cannuck's shine. The Canadian coach,
however, doesn't consider that he has a morale problem on his hands.
Much preferring to accentuate the positive, Birtwell declares: ''Rob
Andrew's goal-kicking for England was just awesome but the important
thing for us was that some of the objectives that we had set ourselves
were realised. We were moving the ball and giving the outside backs
opportunities to show what they could do and we'll still be aiming to
play an expansive game against Scotland.''
Today Canada will be without Twickenham double try scorer Dave
Lougheed -- ''work commitments, we're still amateurs'', said Birtwell
ruefully -- influential back-rower Al Charron. and 20-stone lock
Stormin' Norm Hadley.
Birtwell concedes that the wing and flanker will be missed but --
perhaps with just a degree of kidology -- reckons that the unfit
Hadley's absence will not be to Canada's detriment.
And finally, a win today would mean that the Scottish High Command, in
the form of Messrs Paterson, Hastings and Morgan, would be spared their
post-match press conference impersonation of radio's The Glums. A sense
of perspective and, even more importantly, a sense of humour is a
prerequisite in these trying times. On which note the observation by one
Welsh wag is worthy of recall.
When last year's Five Nations' champions Wales were on the ropes after
a string of defeats at the end of the eighties, he was moved to declare:
''One win from eight games and that was against Western Samoa. Thank God
it wasn't the whole of Samoa we were playing.''

SCOTLAND must aim to make the lineout an area of domination against
Canada at Murrayfield this afternoon towards fashioning a victory that
will put them in good heart for their entry to the Five Nations' against
Ireland in a fortnight.
The Canadian lineout was weak against England, whose forest of players
took some 75% of throw-in ball and thus forced the Canadians to employ
unorthodox methods of long throws over the tail, shortened lines, and
low, short throws to the front man just to keep the ball away from
English tower blocks.
Scotland's players will be on their toes to counter such ploys but
will be more concerned to ensure high-quality delivery from their own
throws, and that means a mix of two-handed catching to deter predators,
ball swept, and driven ball delivered off the top.
The Canadian scrummage looked solid, but if Peter Wright can set
alongside his broken-play contributions, an immovable scrummage bulwark
that used to be the province of the inimitable Iain Milne, Scotland
should have a secure initial platform that will inspire confidence
elsewhere.
Over the past decade Scotland's ball-winning capability has increased,
with the lineout in particular an improved area. The variations in
personnel and positioning with which they out-thought England's big men
in 1990 was just one instance of careful planning and execution. Winning
more ball, however, does not of necessity go hand in hand with winning
the game. It is in the area of ball use that the key scoring elements
are to be found.
In that cracking match at Mansfield Park on Saturday, Hawick's array
of big lineout players gathered in a rich haul so that they had control
of much of the first half.
They should have been comfortably situated at half-time but led by
only 8-3, not so much because they made poor use of such healthy
rations, but because their ball retention skills were found wanting as
those cunning, strong souls in the Stirling County pack plundered ball.
It is one of the advantages of the smaller stature forwards, such as
Kevin McKenzie and Brian Ireland, that they can go for ground ball
legally because they mainly can stay on their feet. As a result the
county several times were able to ease pressure by snaffling ball that
Hawick had taken in.
So Scotland will have to concentrate on retaining ball at contact
point. Ball that has been stolen is often of high quality to the
opposition, and the Canadians demonstrated against England that they are
sharp in accepting opportunities for running at unset defences.
As just one example when Rob Andrew missed touch, the Canadians
countered at such a lick from halfway as to create a super try for their
left wing after a move that started on the right touchline. It took the
English by surprise also that an Andrew garryowen not only was gathered
in by the full back but was transferred immediately to his left wing
running flat out on a scissors to the right for another exciting
midfield sortie.
It was just like the 1971 Lions, J P R Williams and Gerald Davies, all
over again.
It is, however, in the use they make of the ball they win that
Scotland must seek the most striking improvement. Scots always compete
combatively and competently in the areas of raw engagement, in
pressurising opponents into panic measures, and forcing error through
high-kick tactics and swift harassment.
Hopefully they will aim against Canada to complement those traditional
strengths with the kind of continuity at pace that success in the modern
game demands. The momentum game calls for keeping ball alive, moving the
point of penetration through clever use of varied running angles, moving
ball out of tackles, and supporting in numbers.
Under the coaching influence of Jack Rowell, England are pledged to
use all those factors in a more expansive approach, although it will be
fascinating to see how they play it against 15 Irishmen drooling at the
lips to get in amongst them in Dublin this afternoon.
The English exploited their cushion of penalty goals with some
bewildering changes in incision points and ball flow in beating the
Canadians, although it will not have been lost on Douglas Morgan and
Richie Dixon that those Canadians never let their heads go down and
indeed scored three tries.
Craig Chalmers also should call on his Greenyards partner, Bryan
Redpath, for variation in his pass angles so that gain-line penetration
can be achieved through progressively flatter alignment, so placing
opponents on the back foot.
Scotland needs success to lift morale and end their run of nine games
without a win. Hopefully, and without throwing caution to the wind, and
if weather permits, they will accomplish that goal by putting together
all of those elements for a fluent game but, as Frank Sinatra would say,
''at the right time, and in the right tempo.''

JEREMY Guscott back for England, Ireland not worried about lack of
experience, the Welsh quite happy about being underdogs to retain their
title, and the French criticising British rugby. The Five Nations'
Championship action has already started without a pass being played.
Guscott is back for the first time in 22 months, and England's
try-scoring count should benefit against Ireland in Dublin today.
With the advantage of playing France at home, England should be
capable of a third Grand Slam under Carling, compensating for the
under-achievements of 1989, '90, '93 and '94.
But Ireland coach Gerry Murphy has dismissed claims that his team's
lack of experience will prove fatal. Murphy, whose side are aiming for a
third successive victory over Carling's men, said: ''It can be argued
that we have a fair bit of inexperience in our team, though I would not
myself necessarily agree with that.''
Champions Wales, meanwhile, believe they can produce another upset
when they face favourites France at the Parc des Princes.
Like last season when they were written off by their critics, Wales
are considered among the also-rans this time with France and England's
clash at Twickenham next month expected to be the championship decider.
Coach Alan Davies reckons that could be to his side's advantage
against France, even though Wales have not won in Paris since 1975.
French coach Pierre Berbizier has raised the tempo beforehand by
slamming Wales and the other home countries for being unambitious.
''We do not expect the British -- and the Welsh in particular -- to
take much initiative in the game,'' he said. ''They will base their game
on the fundamentals, winning the ball and pressurising us with kicks.''

ENGLAND'S second team started the international weekend in Dublin with
a 21-20 win over Ireland A that should have been more comfortable.
England endured a last minute of anxiety when they conceded an
injury-time try to Irish hooker Billy Mulcahy. Alan McGowan converted to
bring the scores to within a point and England kicked-off downfield,
ensuring that the match stayed safe.
The thousands of English supporters in the city saw a win, but little
entertainment -- apart from a slick try by Neil Back three minutes from
the end that decided the match.
England manager Peter Rossborough said: ''It was a poor game, but the
result was just. We fielded nine players new to this level and their
inexperience showed.''

Scotland A 9, France A 13
FOR a while yesterday, Scotland A, a rag-bag collection of a hastily
put-together team, played with a guile and gusto that would make a
neutral nod in approval as they tried in vain to reverse last year's
loss against the French at Balgray.
Remarkable considering the opposition had seven full caps on display,
were successful on tour against South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia
recently, and with the promotion of so many of David Johnston's men to
the senior side. One man's loss is another's gain, and Douglas Morgan's
team will do well to emulate some of the shadow side's ploys later
today.
Rowen Shepherd, the Edinburgh Academical full back, at last pinned his
name on the selectors' board with a fine display under the high ball,
and in his running, he looked a genuine threat to Gavin Hastings.
Scott Hastings and Ronnie Eriksson looked centres with presence and up
front, the tireless Ian Smith and Fergus Wallace were to the fore. Smith
revels in traversing the ground and the strong-arm stuff, Wallace always
is on hand, while Rob Scott and Jeremy Richardson won many a lineout
ball.
Organisation was the name of the game. A strategy based on the mini
ruck, allied to backs waiting for forwards to arrive before unloading
the ball, confused a heavy French pack sufficiently for Stuart Laing to
give his side a half-time lead of 6-0 with two penalties, which he
extended after the break.
The French had pace in David Venditti on the right wing, Olivier
Brouzet was a massive presence on the touchlines, and as their game
became more threatening, stand-off Benoit Bellot was able to demonstrate
his abilities.
Bellot's boot clawed back three points, and one 15-metre maul drove
Sylvain Dispagne, another cap, over for a try, which Bellot converted to
nose the French into the lead.
Despite Stuart Reid's barges, Graeme Burns' probings, and the
never-say-die attitude of the younger Hastings, the Scots were left to
chase a game that the French were controlling in the tackle and the
lineout.
A penalty from Bellot ended the day, the referee's whistle sounding a
sorry, but brave note, in the ears of the A team. So ends this side's
winning run, but the message is there that David Johnston and Hugh
Campbell have done much in a short time. Pressure on those above you is
a very good thing.
Scotland 'A' -- R J S Shepherd (Edinburgh Accies); H R Gilmour
(Heriot's FP), S Hastings (Watsonians), B R S Eriksson (London
Scottish), M E Appleson (Sale); S Laing (Instonians), G G Burns
(Stew/Mel); J J Manson (Dundee HS FP), J A Hay (Hawick), D J Herrington

IT IS tempting, after leaving the company of Naseem Hamed and his
trainer, Brendan Ingle, to seek out the nearest obliging bookmaker and
invest the mortgage, rent, housekeeping and next year's salary on the
young Prince becoming world champion. In the old canvas-and-resin game
there has to be self-esteem, there has to be hype and there has to be
confidence, but in Ingle and Hamed there is also a ridiculous but
unshakeable conviction that all of the outrageous claims they make will
come to fruition.
The two fight a good fight, as they have proved in the 24 years since
the seven-year-old first entered the Ingle gym in Sheffield. In the last
seven years, as amateur and pro, this self-elected prince has not lost a
fight. But if they ever lose the fighting touch, Frank Warren, the Hamed
promoter, need only lock them in a room with an opponent and they will
frighten him into the nearest airport.
Hamed, flashy and exciting in the ring, is a well-spoken, sincere
young man outside it. When he appears in the SECC in Glasgow tonight, he
and Ingle will no doubt have some new tricks up their sleeve but, if the
showmanship is fine, the searing conviction in Hamed's eyes when he
talks quietly away from the opium of the cameras is perhaps what marks a
young man who could, indeed, be very special.
When I asked him if he will one day be the best in the world, he
replied: ''WILL? I AM the best in the world.'' It was not said loudly,
not snarled viciously, merely offered with a tinge of indignation.
There have been others down the years who have tried to emulate the
self-projection of the one and only Muhammad Ali, but the great majority
had egos which well outstripped their talent. The gyms of Camden Town,
Detroit, and Chicago are peopled by middle aged ex-contenders who
believed they were something special. The saying is easy, the doing is
something else altogether.
But so far, the Naseem bandwagon rolls on impressively and ITV might
well have unearthed the biggest attraction in British boxing for decades
to entertain the masses.
There is no doubt about his inherent talent. Ingle will tell you that
his WBC International super-bantamweight champion, as well as European
bantamweight champ, has the fastest hands and feet in the business. His
speed of punch has been timed to show that he can deliver 54 in 12
seconds which seems to me impossible but, then, how do I count them?
What is for sure is that Naseem has extraordinarily quick reactions and
has used this skill to bamboozle fighters all the way up to champion
status.
He has been doing this bamboozling bit since he was a very small boy.
Ingle first saw his aspiring superstar from the top deck of a bus
outside a school in Sheffield. ''I looked down when the bus stopped for
a minute and there was this wee kid with his back to a wall taking on
three bigger lads, nipping in between, from one to another, and out
again. It made me laugh.''
The man from Dublin has handled some fine fighters in his time, among
them Herol Graham, but he has been laughing with Naseem ever since that
day in the playground. A couple of weeks afterwards, Naseem's dad, Sal,
a shopkeeper, turned up with Naseem and his two brothers, asking the
Irishman to teach them how to defend themselves. ''He was worried about
the taunting they had to take, the racist comments and things like
that,'' said Ingle.
Born in Sheffield, Hamed is from a Yemen family which is very close
indeed. All of them, including four sisters, generally come to see him
fight, except his mother who, like most boxers' mums, prefers to stay at
home. She prays that Naseem and his opponent come through safely.
Naseem remembers that first day in the gym when the bond between him
and Ingle was tied. ''I have been with him ever since and anything he
says is fine by me.'' But that should not be interpreted as a permanent
condition of sweetness and light between the two. They have arguments,
all right, mainly because, according to Brendan, he has educated his lad
too well.
Like many of his countrymen, Ingle is something of a philosopher. He
describes the way the relationship has developed in a favourite
aphorism. ''To be ignorant is sad, but to be ignorant and not know it,
is very sad. But for you to know I am ignorant and not educate me is
terrible.''
He did, I am relieved to say, ask for answers on a postcard, but did
add that Naz, as he calls him, has always questioned him if he was
doubtful about any decision.
''He is his own man and if he doesn't agree he will soon tell me. But
you can see we get on pretty well together.'' Unlike Chris Eubank, whom
Hamed accuses of stealing his party tricks, Naz enjoys his sport. Eubank
has said often that he does not actually like boxing but it provides him
with a means to an end, security. The new pretender doesn't have any
time for that argument. ''I love boxing. I always have, since the day I
walked into that gym. I knew right away that I was good at it. It felt
comfortable.''
He has been to Scotland before, as an 14-year-old in the Ingle stable,
when he was brought north to see a promotion by Alex Morrison, father of
Katherine who co-promotes tonight's fight. Brendan can remember saying
to some of the watchers in Morrison's gym as the slip of a boy trained:
''Watch this lad. He will be special.''
Ingle insists that none of the excessive claims made by this
20-year-old with the goatee beard, which makes him look as if he means
business, is simply a sales technique. ''He has been like this from the
start. He would say to me when he was boy: watch this move, now this. He
does it still, tells me how he is going to knock out this one or that
one. And he then goes and does it.''
The Irishman gets so animated by his recollections of his man's moves
that he cannot resist jumping up and showing how it is done. At these
points it is wise to move your chair back a couple of feet, lest he
demonstrates it a touch too effectively.
Ingle defends his man against accusations of treating an opponent with
contempt when he took the European title from Vicenzo Belcastro. Many
seasoned fight folk were angry at the Sheffield lad's intimidation of
the champion in the final round when he stuck out his chin, inviting him
to try his luck.
But Ingle says that what they didn't know was that the champion had
twice butted his man and had mauled him to the canvas in another round.
''This, too, was the fight which a few people in Sheffield said we were
mad to take. He wouldn't last 12 rounds at that level, they said. That
was why Naseem raised his arm to show them how strong he still was.''
You wouldn't expect an objective opinion from the trainer, anyway, but
at least he admits that it took him time to get accustomed to the
innovations in which this flamboyant fighter revels. He knew what to
expect from an early stage. ''When he was fighting for England
schoolboys against America a lot of the lads were a bit overawed by the
flash style of the American kids. But yer man goes out and gets a gold
dressing gown specially made for the occasion. He was told not to wear
it but he did and he somersaulted into the ring an' all. He won, too.''
Naz himself doesn't hesitate to tell you that his idol was Muhammad Ali,
whose shuffle he learned long ago. He embellishes it with a bit of
flashing hand movement and footwork of his own and loves its effect on
the crowd.
Naz likes to point out that, at 20, Chris Eubank was boxing four
three-minute rounds. ''And Nigel Benn would tell you himself he was
fighting Mexican roadsweepers at the same age. Here at 20 I am a double
champion.'' Trying to unearth some kind of realism from all of these
excesses is close to impossible. When Naseem says he will be the next
Ali, Ray Robinson, Ray Lonard et al, it is best to nod your head in
reflective submission. But when you ask for the truth from a trainer of
30 years and more experience in the game and he looks at you straight in
the eye before saying: ''He will be better than all of them,'' you head
for home wondering if they really have taken over the asylum.
But Prince Naseem Hamed and his broth of a trainer have not been wrong
so far. It should be fun watching what happens next.

IN a previous existence, Colin Jackson's mentor, Malcolm Arnold, was
national coach for Uganda. His equipment budget was #6 per year, yet he
still succeeded in producing one of the great Olympic champions, John
Akii-Bua, the 400 metres hurdler who broke David Hemery's world record
to win gold in Munich 23 years ago.
So it should have come as no surprise when Arnold was named this week
as UK director of athletic coaching, successor to Scotsman Frank Dick,
who tendered his resignation because he could not face the prospect of
an #850,000 reduction in budget, to #450,000.
Arnold, Welsh national coach for the past 21 years, was named as
interim stand-in when Dick's bluff was called, and has now been
permanently endorsed in the job. The salary, yet to be confirmed, he
admits is, ''likely to be more'' than the #37,000 Dick received.
There was little love lost between them, but don't expect Arnold to
say so. Whatever his qualities -- and these are considerable --
diplomacy rates high up the list.
He states that Dick has recently said: ''some pretty unpleasant things
about me.'' But he declines to dignify them with a reply.
This week he laid a new structure for the sport before the management
board of the British Athletic Federation. ''The last major coaching
review was before Frank was appointed in 1979,'' confirms Arnold. The
54-year-old Welshman is still thrashing out his brief, and the
priorities. ''Basically it is to maintain team performance -- the shop
window, recruit athletes and coaches, and improve development.''
For almost a year, holding the fort has meant 12-hour days in BAF's
Birmingham office, sandwiched between 120-mile drives to and from home
in Wales.
The journey may have been less of a discipline for him than most. For
the man who tunes some of the world's fastest athletes spends what spare
time he has getting hands dirty in the guts of a rally car. Indeed, he
has some success in minor events to his credit.
Now, however, he is looking for a new home, near the sport's
Birmingham HQ. ''I'll continue to look after Welsh athletics meantime,''
he said. ''I don't want to let go everything we've worked for, with
nobody to take over.''
There is no hint of glee in his voice as he reveals that the doomsday
cuts scenario, over which Dick resigned, have not taken place.''The
budget has been restored, and the management board is backing me all the
way,'' he says. ''I didn't have to fight.''
Operating on a shoestring however would have been no novelty. Arnold
spent five years based in Kampala as Uganda's national coach.''My
equipment budget was #6,'' he recalls. ''I bought a hammer glove and
some wires.''
Despite that, with not one all-weather track, working on grass, he
produced an Olympic champion, sowing the seeds of his hurdles expertise,
which has blossomed to perfection in world record-holder Jackson.
He transformed Akii-Bua from a modest triple and long jumper into a
hurdler. Akii-Bua, also national decathlon champion, was fourth in the
110m hurdles at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, yet in a new
event two years later, in Munich, he beat Hemery, the defending Olympic
400m hurdles champion.
Akii-Bua was a media man's dream. He was one of 43 children born to
his father's eight wives. But Arnold made no point at all of
volunteering such information when quizzed about his protege.
''John used to train with a weighted vest,'' he recalled this week.
''But that was not enough for you press guys. You had him wearing a 25lb
lead jacket. It didn't weigh even half that. You had him training over
bamboo canes. It was all a bit of poetic license.''
Yet Arnold's personal fairy-tale history compares with any in
athletics.
On population and financial resources considerably less than
Scotland's, he has achieved spectacularly. Apart from the
well-documented exploits of Jackson, Arnold's reign spans the era of
Welsh stars including Steve Jones, who set a world marathon best,
international hurdler Nigel Walker who became Welsh rugby winger,
Olympic thrower Venissa Head, women's Commonwealth hurdles champion Kay
Morley, and Victoria hurdles medallist Paul Gray.
He hands the credit for Gray's medal to Jackson. ''Paul's success, and
that of Jamie Baulch, is really down to Colin -- he's proving almost as
good a coach as I am.'' He laughs: ''I believe in giving credit where it
is due.''
Behind that remark lies implicit criticism of Dick. ''It rankled with
many coaches that Frank hogged the limelight,'' he admits. ''Britain's
success over the past 15 years is not due to the efforts of one person,
but to team-work by many coaches. ''My philosophy will be to emphasise
the benefits of team work.''
Arnold, though lower profile, may achieve even higher than the man he
replaced. Dick regularly fell out, notably, with team captain Linford
Christie. But the sprinter is on good terms with the new man. As Arnold
says: ''Athletes are my bread and butter. I have to have good
relationships, and will work hard to make them good quickly.''

NASEEM Hamed undoubtedly has all the talent and the confidence. But
JIM REYNOLDS gives him a pre-fight warning.
THE Prince will have Glasgow's SECC rocking tonight -- that is the
promise from the 20-year-old wonder boy from Sheffield who defends his
World Boxing Council super-bantamweight title against Mexico's Armando
Castro.
There is no room for modesty in Naseem Hamed's make-up. ''I have
enjoyed my time in Glasgow and I aim to give the Scottish fans something
special. They are going to see someone who will go down as the best
fighter Britain has ever produced.''
The man, who has an invitation from the President of Yemen to visit
the land of his parents with a view to fighting there for a world title,
has captured the imagination of genuine fight fans, and those who watch
on television. He showboats, he clowns, he dances, and thinks nothing of
doing the odd somersault or flip. But he can also fight.
Claims from Castro's camp that, with only 15 paid fights behind him,
he should not be making outrageous statements about his own abilities
would be valid if aimed towards others. But Hamed has such intense
belief in himself that you cannot help going along with him.
Despite his 15 contests, as against the 62 of the Mexican challenger,
the only question Hamed has not answered is whether or not he can take a
bang on the chin.
He hasn't been hit hard enough yet, such is his speed, and although
Castro has a wealth of experience, including three attempts at full
blown world titles, if Hamed says he will stop him, then I am inclined
to agree, although I hope the youngster doesn't take too many risks
along the way. At this level, the business is far too serious.
Two other titles are down for decision, with a lot of interest in
London's Dennis Andries, who this week admitted to being 48. He meets
Denzil Browne, of Leeds, for the vacant British cruiserweight title.
The third title is for the Scottish featherweight crown between the
holder, James Murray of Newmains, and Blackpool-based Louis Veitch.
Murray will be a strong favourite, but the Anglo-Scot is a tough little
customer and this one could go the distance.
Also being featured on tonight's bill is Dublin's Michael Carruth, who
won gold at welterweight for Ireland at the Barcelona Olympics, and Ryan
Rhodes, a middleweight from the same gym as Hamed.
Among the other Scots in action are light-heavyweight John Wilson,
from Edinburgh who won a silver at the Commonwealth Games, former ABA
champion Brian Carr, from Moodiesburn, at feather, leading British
lightweight contender Dave Anderson, from Glasgow who meets Carlos Lopez
of Spain, and Edinburgh super middle Sean Heron.
All in all it should be a good night for the Scots, but the Prince
should be taking the biggest bow of all. Well, that's the way it is in
all of these glitzy productions, isn't it?

<HEADLINE>Slaughter policy answer to calf exports problem</HEADLINE>

A call for the Government to fund a slaughter policy as a short-term
answer to the present controversy over the export of live calves bound
for the veal trade in Europe, has been made by the Banffshire area
executive of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland.
The majority at the meeting expressed anger that the country appeared
to be sanctioning mob rule, with transport interrupted, and a decision
by the authorities at Shoreham to end the export of calves from that
port.
Retiring area president Jim Christie called on the Government not to
sanction a blanket ban on a trade which was entirely legitimate as long
as strict rules were adhered to. Banffshire farmer Alan Taylor, Boghead,
Ord, said that farmers should not be ashamed to go down the slaughter
route in the short term.
''A slaughter policy would show folk that farmers are flexible,'' he
said. ''It is, however, a short-term measure. Longer term, the whole
country will need to address the problem that has been thrown up here --
that of the minority ruling the majority. That should not be allowed.''
The calf issue was a very emotive subject, but emotion should not be
allowed to disguise the real need for immediate, serious, but
constructive dialogue between sensible representatives from all sides,
he added.
Glenrinnes farmer Donnie Campbell warned that stopping calf exports
would not stop the veal trade. Buyers would just look elsewhere for
their supplies.
Finding a solution in Europe was widely seen as a way forward, through
a campaign to raise European welfare standards to more acceptable
levels. Banff branch representative David Gill favoured that approach as
against a slaughter policy -- which could attract adverse publicity.
NFUS national president John Ross, in an address to the Aberdeen area
annual general meeting, said that the union were doing all they could to
put forward the farmers' case on the issues of calf exports and animal
transport generally.
He suggested that in the longer term, farmers could turn the welfare
argument to their benefit, by making it a strong selling point that
their animals were well cared for.
He took the opportunity to encourage farmers to join the various farm
assurance schemes, which gave the customer confidence that they were
buying quality produce. The general reaction from his audience was that,
in return, they would expect to receive a premium price from the market.
''Why are we having difficulty in getting sufficient members to put
their money and expertise behind these schemes?,'' he asked.
''Because there isn't enough money in it,'' appeared to be the
consensus reply.
Mr George Lyon, convener of the NFUS animal welfare committee,
speaking to Forth Valley area representatives, claimed that if livestock
exports from this country were banned, the gap in the market for calves
would be filled from Eastern Europe. In that case, calves would have to
endure journey times of up to 48 hours, compared to the 15-hour limit
recommended by the UK.
Instead of blocking UK ports, the animal welfare activists should be
lobbying other countries in Europe, he suggested. Mr Lyon said that he
did not favour the introduction of a slaughter policy for young calves.
But if it was decided that such a policy was to be adopted, it could be
implemented within weeks.
It was essential, he said, for the farming industry to support the
promotional activities of the Meat and Livestock Commission. An
important part of their remit was to get into the schools. ''That is the
next battlefield.''

<HEADLINE>Sir Teddy calls for an end to Common Agricultural Policy</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DAN BUGLASS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980254848</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SIR Teddy Taylor MP, who is currently free from the strictures of the
whip's office, yesterday made a strident call for the ending of the
Common Agricultural Policy. He advocated a return to the old deficiency
payments system of farming support, suggesting that both consumers and
farmers themselves would be well in pocket.
Sir Teddy, who has been a consistent anti-European for over 25 years,
outlined his views, saying: ''In the Community with 15 member States
there is no way we can arrive at a system which is not harder on one
than the other. It simply cannot be reformed.
''I don't think most people understand the magnitude of the nonsense
involved, with the average family paying an extra #26 per week in higher
taxes and food prices. We have to get rid of the CAP for the good of
everyone.''
His analysis includes a call for repatriation of agricultural policies
to individual member States, which he believes would be of advantage to
farmers. ''It would work, as long as we had an agreement to ensure that
one country was not using subsidies to grab an unfair share of the
market.
''If we did it this way, any money we spent in the UK would go direct
to the farmers, and would not be used to service the nonsense of
Brussels, which involves so much money being spent on fraud, and the
destruction of surpluses.''
In response to how he would counter the inevitable French manipulation
of a new policy, Sir Teddy said that the UK held one significant ace.
''The only real power we have, is the power of cash. It looks as though
the CAP budget for 1995 will be over the top, and Brussels will come to
us for more cash. I say not one penny more -- and we do have the veto on
this matter -- until we agree to scrap the CAP.''
Sir Teddy also reckons that his views have all-party support, but that
unfortunately the respective leaders do not dare to come out and admit
this openly. The New Zealand situation was one he used as an example.
''They removed subsidies overnight, and while it was hard for some they
are, as a whole, now doing remarkably well, competing against subsidised
food.''
However, he did concede that there would probably be a need for some
form of support in the UK. ''I fancy we would go back to the old
deficiency payments scheme -- that worked well, and was cost
effective.''
Tom Brady, chief executive of the Scottish NFU, was quick to discount
Sir Teddy's opinions. ''If we did what he wanted, the single market
concept would be dead. We would see tariff barriers springing up all
over the place, with the system falling to bits. But then again, that is
precisely what he wants to see happen.''
Mr Brady was also wary of any UK Government's commitment to
agriculture regardless of party. He said: ''Just look at the present
administration. If they had their way, the levels of support would
undoubtedly have been reduced, and farming would be off the European
agenda.
''The whole movement on the world scene since 1945 has been towards
freer trade. That's what GATT is all about, and we cannot live in
economic isolation.''

I MADE the mistake the other day of asking our supportive
non-executive adviser for a proper definition of my role in the company.
He looked delighted and I realised, too late, that the floodgates had
been inadvertently opened.
His paper duly arrived. It looked as daunting as I had feared. Under
no less than nine headings fell a strenuous set of responsibilities.
Although it is the weekend and business should be the last thing on
your mind, I see no reason why you should escape sharing my workload
worries.
That list of responsibilities were divided between the usual
categories of running the business, leading its development and pushing
performance levels -- not to mention strategic thinking, building
management quality and generally pursuing excellence all over the place.
For instance, under ''People Development'' my job is ''to build a
positive work environment, identify key roles, upgrade management
quality, find stars and get each department to work effectively
together''. Another beauty was ''to be the innovative thinker and
creator of new business ideas for existing and new business divisions''.
All this and the MD's conventional role of trouble shooting? ''So what
do I do Tuesdays?'' I asked with all the force that comes from a sudden
loss of confidence.
As is our NEA's wont he patiently took me through the paper to point
out some significant angles. Of course I was not expected to personally
tackle every single objective, merely to be clear about what was
required and to make sure it was done. And of course there are lots of
modern techniques and processes to help one tackle issues like creating
a positive work environment.
''The most important issue overall,'' he explained gently, ''is to
achieve a combination of leading and managing the company. It's doing
the right things and doing things right, daily, weekly, monthly and
yearly.''
Therein lie the fundamentals of any MD's job in a growing business.
The most successful people that I know manage this trick of providing
clear leadership for their people, based on a firm grasp of market
opportunities and their business's strengths while effectively tackling
the web of other responsibilities that make each day such a challenge.
Often MDs make the best salespeople, despite their many other
pressures. Often they are personally responsible for creating an
external awareness of the business through their networking activities;
to the outside world they ARE the company.
How these individuals manage that difficult, double-sided trick is
usually the making or the breaking of their business in a very real
sense. If they don't get it right there won't be the leader upon which
every organisation requires to focus. Or if there is such a leader then
the other side of the equation is neglected and the company becomes an
internal shambles lacking the systems and procedures that are essential
for consistent performance.
Until now I had felt only uncomprehending jealousy for the
disgustingly effective paragons of owner-manager virtue that I
encounter. Now, thanks in no small meaasure to our NEA and his
consistent pushing of the management development agenda, I can dimly
visualise what it takes to achieve such heights.
It never fails to amaze me how slender is our base of knowledge here
in Scotland about the skills and qualities that are required to run
successful growing companies.
There are some 60,000 registered companies trading here at any one
time. I would bet serious money -- well, certainly a fiver -- that at
least 90% of them are managed by people who feel considerable insecurity
about their performance.
To where and to whom can they turn in search of guidance? If you are
fortunate, like us, they may find an experienced manager to effectively
become mentor to the management team. Scottish Enterprise's Company
Growth Programme is still the best scheme of its kind for putting
ambitious companies together with this calibre of non-executive adviser.
Alternatively they could try networking through the growing number of
organisations to bring business people together for such purposes. Or
they can go in search of a business angel. What they will find rather
more difficult is joining a management development course specifically
constructed for the owner-manager. At present there are but handful in
Scotland, mostly organised by specialist consultants on behalf of
various local enterprise companies.
Developing the MDs of our growing companies so that they can perform
in the sort of role envisaged by our adviser is a real national
priority. It's also a huge market opportunity which organisations such
as business schools ignore at their peril.

AS the days slip by, the timetable shortens for Scottish Nuclear to
get the go-ahead to build a dry-store for spent fuel at its Torness AGR
station and to reap the first financial benefits of that investment in
its 1994-95 results.
The proposed Torness store was the subject of a public inquiry which
ended in January 1993. The Reporter later commended the proposal as a
''sound engineering solution, where the spent fuel can be held safely,
monitored and retrieved if necessary''.
But he also raised a decade-old issue -- whether multi-site stores at
individual power stations are preferable to a single national store. The
Secretary of State for Scotland seized on that issue last year to put
off pressing the green light on the Torness store until the Department
of the Environment's review of radioactive waste management policy
completes its work.
The waste management review is running in parallel with the other
ongoing review into the future of the UK's nuclear power industry,
announced by the Energy Minister Tim Eggar last May. Submissions to both
reviews closed in October. Conclusions are unlikely before this summer.
That does not help Scottish Nuclear's calculations on its dry-store
initiative. It argues it can save #45m a year from storing the spent
fuel on-site rather than sending it for storage and eventual
reprocessing at BNFL's massive new Thorp plant at Sellafield.
If it gets the green light on the Torness store before the end of
March, it can include the impact of that saving in its costings and, it
has predicted, get the unit cost of the nuclear power it generates down
to 2.5p a unit in its 1994-95 financial results.
There are private indications that that green light may indeed be
pressed very soon, long before the rest of the conclusions in the waste
management review are revealed, and soon enough for Scottish Nuclear to
get planning consent before April and see the impact reflected in lower
generating costs this year.
If that is indeed what happens, SN will eventually stop sending spent
AGR fuel to Sellafield for reprocessing at Thorp (the thermal oxide
reprocessing plant). So far some 700 tonnes of spent AGR fuel from
Scotland has made that journey.
But, if Scottish Nuclear's spent fuel ends up being stored on site at
Torness (and eventually in a dry store at Hunterston, too), what does
that mean for the viability of Thorp, at #1850m (#2750m if you include
Thorp's share of various peripheral facilities at Sellafield), one of
the largest single-site industrial capital investments ever seen in the
UK?
Over the Christmas period, two German nuclear power stations, one near
Hamburg, the other in Bavaria, cancelled contracts to send spent fuel to
Thorp for reprocessing. Both are taking advantage of changes in German
nuclear legislation to store the waste instead at a facility currently
under construction in Lower Saxony.
The cancelled Thorp contracts caused a flurry of press interest at the
year-end and rekindled speculation about the eventual fate of Thorp,
which only commenced operations itself last March, after protracted
humming and hawing by Whitehall over whether or not state-owned BNFL
should be allowed to complete its commissioning.
As it happens I spent a day at Sellafield the week before Christmas to
see Thorp and the rest of the facilities for myself. By then Thorp had
some 3000 tonnes of spent fuel rods (equivalent to four years' worth of
reprocessing activity) stored under water in the complex's vast covered
ponds. A mere 30 tonnes had, by late December, moved on down the
reprocessing chain, to have the uranium, plutonium and highly-active
waste extracted from them.
BNFL people are very relaxed about that rate of progress. They point
out that the only rival reprocessing plant in Europe -- the Gogema
facility in Normandy -- processed only 18 tonnes in its first year.
Thorp already has contracts, covering reprocessing of 7000 tonnes of
spent fuel, in place covering its first ten years of operation. There
are 30 contracts covering nine countries, split roughly equally among
UK, European and Japanese customers.
That's enough, BNFL argues, to make a return on Thorp's colossal
front-end investment by year ten. The second ten years' reprocessing
would then produce the real cream, I was told.
The recently cancelled German contracts do not affect these
calculations for Thorp's first decade. They relate to work which was to
have been carried out in the reprocessing plant's second decade, from
2004 to 2114. Thorp already had around 3400 tonnes of business with UK
and German utilities pencilled in for that decade. Clearly the recent
cancellation will have an impact on that, perhaps the loss of 20% of
total orders in Thorp's second decade, according to one estimate.
Taken together with the expected green light for Scottish Nuclear's
dry store -- where spent rods can be kept for up to 50 years -- the
growing enthusiasm for storage rather than early reprocessing clearly
poses a challenge for BNFL, longer term. That cream could turn out to be
less thick than it might have been.
The delays in commissioning Thorp, with anti-nuclear groups pressuring
ministers to mothball it, cost BNFL #80m on its bottom line in last
year's accounts. ''We propose to pay the Exchequer a dividend of #26m
this year,'' wrote chairman John Guinness. ''If Thorp had not been
delayed we would have been able to pay a substantially higher
dividend.''
Now that Thorp has started reprocessing, the agenda has shifted. In
its submission to the radioactive waste management review, BNFL
recognises that the choice of the most appropriate means of managing
irradiated fuel from power stations should be ''a matter for the
commercial judgment of the nuclear utility which owns the fuel''.
BNFL goes on to argue strongly that extended interim storage of
irradiated fuel in either wet or dry stores is not in itself a permanent
solution. It is, the submission argues, only a holding position which
defers the final choice -- reprocessing or direct disposal.
BNFL's main arguments for reprocessing are that it reduces the volume
of waste, conserves uranium resources and reduces uranium mining, and
maximises confidence because reprocessing is a mature technology.
But, as we have seen, that dry-store holding position could stretch
out to 50 years, long beyond Thorp's design life. The controversy over
that awesome complex is certainly not over yet.

NOT many pet owners get the opportunity to lick their cat over and
over again. Indeed few cat owners would ever dream of performing this
show of affection on their pets, preferring to leave this pastime to
their pet.
Ronald Gardiner, senior partner in Brodies WS Solicitors will happily
lick Tigger, the family's tabby, and then pat her down, for Tigger is
one of several felines to appear in the Royal Mail's latest special
stamp issue.
Tigger's first class stamp appearance is due to the fact that he often
wanders into the home of Ronald Gardiner's neighbour artist Elizabeth
Blackadder, OBE, who was commissioned by the Royal Mail to produce a
series of cat paintings for the special issue which was launched earlier
this week.
Ronald revealed that Tigger is a regular visitor to Elizabeth's house,
''I think Tigger spends more time there than at home,'' said Ronald,
''so I suppose you could say that he has been drawing attention to
himself.''
Meanwhile with all the licking that is going on Tigger just purred.
Fraudsters take
to mobile phones
MOBILE phone owners beware. It would appear that there are a team of
fraudsters at work.
Andrew Hunter, a financial consultant with Caledonian Investments
Limited, received a call on his mobile from a person purporting to be
from BT. The voice on the other end of the phone claimed to be from BT
saying that they were ''updating Cellnet''.
He asked for Mr Hunter's business phone number then called him on this
number. At this point he asked Mr Hunter to give him the serial number
of his mobile phone.
Mr Hunter became suspicious and refused as he had no means of checking
the person's identity, and instead called Cellnet. The telephone company
were alarmed when they heard what had happened.
A spokeswoman for Cellnet told Business Diary: ''We find this very
worrying. It is possible to clone a phone, however it requires very
sophisticated equipment.''
She added: ''I am sure that we will be issuing a warning to our
users.''
Meanwhile the other scams such as the correspondence from Nigeria
requesting bank details so that money can be transferred or the
unsolicited invoices are still occurring and companies should contact
their local Consumer and Trading Standards department if they receive
any approaches.
Talking up
Scottish business
SOME of Scotland's best-known business people have formed themselves
into Speakers' Forums as part of the campaign to double Scotland's
business birth rate by the year 2000.
The first forum to get off the ground was Glasgow and West of Scotland
with speakers such as Arnold Clark, Ken McCulloch and Taylor Ferguson.
Earlier this week the Edinburgh and East of Scotland Forum was formed
with Erick Davidson and Mike Rutherford among those who will speak to
groups about the joys of running your own business.
Scottish Enterprise are putting on training courses organised by
broadcaster Ian McLaren Thomson for those who want to hone their public
speaking skills.
The double-the-business-birth-rate campaign is being led by Russell
Griggs of Scottish Enterprise and his colleague Jeanne Magro.
If your club or association would like a speaker from one of the
forums you should drop a short note to Gordon Beattie at Beattie Media,
117 Cadzow Street, Hamilton ML3 6JA.
Heseltine heads
impressive list
PRESIDENT of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine and Eddie George,
Governor of the Bank of England, are down to speak at the British
Chambers of Commerce Conference which is being held in Aberdeen from May
10-12.
More than 600 business leaders will be in Aberdeen to hear an
impressive line up of speakers as well as discuss ''the framework for
commerce and industry which needs to be in place if we are to achieve
economic growth into the year 2000''.
Other speakers include broadcaster Peter Sissons and former chairman
of ICI, Sir Denys Henderson.
Irish first for
O'Flaherty
I SHOULD talk but they do not come more Irish than O'Flaherty. Like
many who carry such surnames, Pat, in his youth, set sail for Australia
where he worked in a copper mine in the deep bush.
His wanderlust then took him to Spain where he sold paintings before
becoming a taxi driver in Edinburgh.
He is now the proprietor of Xile Clothing shops in Edinburgh which has
allowed him to see a fair bit of the world attending fashion shows in
Milan, Florence and Paris.
Holidays have taken him to places such as Tenerife and Majorca but in
a fortnight's time 47-year-old Pat will break new ground in his travels.
He is going to the Emerald Isle for the first time.
''With a surname like mine,'' explains Pat, ''people often think I am
just off the Irish boat, but in fact it was my great grandfather who
first crossed the sea from Ireland to settle in Scotland.
''I was born and brought up in Leith. When the family arrived in
Scotland we were called Flaherty and the O' was added for devilment.''
Some things, however, have never changed, that is at least until now.
Pat's great-grandfather was called Pat, as was his grandfather and of
course his father.
Pat has broken with tradition. His son is called Joe which I hope does
not cause an argument between St Patrick and St Joseph up in the
heavenly clouds.
A clear case of
black and white
WE all know that solicitors can turn black into white and vice versa
but I really do think that Wright Johnston &amp; Mackenzie is carrying
things too far.
Its senior partner is Campbell White, while the managing partner is
Campbell Black.
At the same time its chief executive is Alistair White which has led
some members of staff to believe that you have to have the right name to
get on in the firm.
The receptionist at the legal firm's offices in St Vincent Place,
Glasgow, often receives strange looks when she is asked for Campbell and
replies ''Black or White?''
Needless to say the firm's corporate colours are . . . black and
white.
Conservatory
setting
BUSINESSES are accustomed to hiring a boardroom in a hotel for their
meetings but the Caledonian Hotel in Inverness is now offering local
companies the opportunity to hire their conservatory for a more relaxed
meeting.
The conservatory overlooking the River Ness was opened in November by
Phil Middleman who plays Des Barnes in Coronation Street.
It appears that quite a few businesses in the area have taken to the
idea of holding their meetings in the conservatory which can hold up to
12 people and costs only #10 an hour to hire.
Orange side
to Barr move
THERE was consternation in many circles when Irn Bru announced its
intention to move from its present site near Celtic Park to Cumbernauld
but every story has a lighter side to it.
It seems that Andrew Walker of the Economic Policy Unit of Glasgow
City Council was asked to prepare a report for councillors on the move
by the company.
Andy explained in his report that Barrs had an exclusive line called
Orangina but when he did his spellcheck on the screen it appeared as
''orangemen'' which might help to explain why Barrs are moving from
their present site.
Dolphin sails
in on torch run
THE Whitbread 60 yacht Dolphin will be berthed in Glasgow for ten days
during April and May as part of ''The Torch Run 1995'' taking in
Amsterdam, London, Glasgow and Dublin for the Special Olympics in New
Haven Connecticut where 7000 competitors will take part later this year.
The charity Venture Abilities is asking Scottish firms to sponsor the
torch run by entering the free Leg Sponsorship competition at a cost of
#1000.
Everyone who enters will have their name inscribed on a plaque in each
port and will receive a framed certificate.
The winning company will have a day with up to 100 guests in the
marque which is to be set up at Stobcross Quay in the shadow of the
crane where the yacht will be berthed.
If you are interested in entering you can obtain full details from Tim
Latham on 0114 272 2415.
Money raised from the competition will go towards helping to pay for
competitors to travel to America.
European job
link set up
COMPANIES advertising staff vacancies are no longer restricted to
using their local Jobcentre following the introduction of the European
Employment Services computer network (EURES).
At present Scotland's link into the computer is based at the Jobcentre
in South St Andrews Street, Edinburgh, but employers can make vacancies
available through their local Jobcentre.
Companies will be able to use EURES to advertise vacancies throughout
Europe, fill specialist posts or to overcome a skill shortage in their
local area, and of course individuals can use the service to learn about
vacancies throughout Europe.
If you want more details you the Overseas Placing Unit in Sheffield on
0114 2596051/2.

IVORY &amp; Sime has launched a Flexible Distribution Portfolio, offering
a quarterly income of the investor's choosing up to 10% per annum.
Money will be invested in the group's investment trusts selected to
provide high dividend income, currently 6.4% gross. If a higher income
is required it will be provided through selling shares.
Ivory &amp; Sime points out that #10,000 invested in 1985 with 10% income
drawn from it would now be worth #26,000, though the period included
times of exceptional stock market performance.
If the initial income was increased by 10% a year the capital
remaining would be #20,000. Investors will have flexibility to alter
income levels if they wish, for example to reduce income when shares are
falling.
Ivory &amp; Sime has also introduced a new range of investment trust PEPs
with a variety of features. The core product is a general investment
trust PEP, either self-select based on the Ivory range of investment
trusts or managed with income or growth options using Ivory and other
trusts.
There is also a single company PEP with a choice of six companies and
a phased PEP portfolio which enables additional money to be invested in
the managed portfolios outside a PEP but with the facility to switch
into a PEP each year.
All plans include a benefit which ensures that on the investor's death
his or her estate will receive the value of the investments or the
original sum invested whichever is the higher.
MORGAN Grenfell is launching a UK growth unit trust using the same
approach as its Selector UK offshore fund, which is ranked first out of
67 funds in its sector. The new trust will be run by the same manager,
Charles Curtis, backed by the same team, following the bottom-up
stock-picking approach.
The company's UK equity income unit trust is ranked second out of 87
since its launch in 1988. The outlook for the UK economy is considered
good by Morgan Grenfell's economists, with the prospect of economic
growth of 3% annually in coming years.
Some sectors will perform better than others, necessitating careful
stock selection. The new growth trust carries an initial charge of 5.25%
and an annual charge of 1.5%.
BARCLAYS Bank is offering a new TESSA which pays 7.5% for the first 18
months, after which it reverts to a variable rate. Minimum investment is
#1000.

PERSONAL Equity Plans have proved a godsend for Prudential in
offsetting a difficult market for life and pensions business last year.
Largely as a result of their successes the group reported an 8% rise
in worldwide new annual premiums to #620m, though single premiums were
unchanged at at #5121m.
New PEP and unit trust business jumped from #36m to #96m, raising UK
regular contribution sales by 12% to #362m, despite a 7% decline in
annual pension and life product sales.
The second half of the year brought a sharp recovery in individual
annual life premiums, which advanced by 28% over the same period in
1993. Sales were still 11% down at #80m for the year, however. Single
premiums were down 14%. Strong sellers were the unit-linked distribution
bond and the new Prudence Savings Account, though the latter took the
shine off the Prudence Bond, whose sales fell 34% to #721m.
In common with the industry generally, individual pensions was down,
by 7% for annual premiums and by 38% for single premiums.
Internationally, Prudential made sound progress. Chief executive Mick
Newmarch commented: ''Our UK sales last year were resilient in an
undoubtedly difficult market, while our US operation produced very
encouraging results overall, particularly given the slow start to the
year. Our businesses in the Pacific markets continued to make strong
progress.''

THE bears were ruling the roost on both sides of the Atlantic last
night as the market optimism of a week ago disappeared into the night.
The sharp fall in UK share prices in the last two days trading was
largely Wall Street induced, though it coincided with a growing
perception in the City that the Bank of England would demand another
rise in base rates at the meeting with the Chancellor of the Exchequer
on February 2.
The FTSE-100 share index went into sharp retreat at the outset in
response to a near-50 point drop on Wall Street overnight. When New York
share prices headed south at the opening, the Footsie fell through the
3000 barrier for the first time since December 15. By the close it was
33.6 points lower at 2995.0, and since Monday night has shed over 80
points.
The Federal Open Market Committee is due to meet on January 31 and
February 1. The equivalent meeting a year ago initiated the Fed's
tighter monetary regime, and the process has so far had little effect in
slowing down the pace of economic activity in the US.
Wall Street traders had hoped that the financial crisis in Mexico
would persuade the Fed to postpone the next increase in US rates, but
this now seems unlikely.
The dollar has been weakening on fears that the Fed would put off the
inevitable at the same time as American shares have been retreating on
the fear that it would go ahead. Such contradictions reflect a huge
divergence of opinion among US pundits about the direction of monetary
policy.
A dollar collapse is much the worst outcome for the authorities. On
Friday fourth quarter GDP figures are likely to show that, far from
slowing down, the American economy has gained momentum.
James Capel economists in London, who are convinced that the FOMC will
sanction a rate hike, are forecasting an annualised growth rate of 5.2%
after 4% in the third. It is difficult to see the American authorities
waiting until the next FOMC meeting on March 28.
Bank of England figures yesterday suggested that bank and building
society lending to the private sector, which had been anaemic from the
middle of the recession until the third year of the recovery, may at
last be picking up.
M4 lending to the corporate and personal sectors rose by a seasonally
adjusted #3900m last month, well above City expectations of around
#3000m. The strong figure came on top of buoyant lending of #4500m in
November and added to the pressures building up for an early rise in UK
interest rates.
A breakdown of separate figures published by the British Bankers'
Association showed continued growth in personal borrowing, a return to
borrowing by the financial sector, but a significant repayment by
manufacturers.
Capel's Adam Cole said that the very strong M4 figures indicated that
companies had borrowed in excess of #2000m in each of the latest two
months from overseas banks.
With the stock market well below its peak rights issues have fallen
away. There would be no great surprise in companies returning to the
banking sector for extra funds, especially as the recovery is beginning
to broaden out with capital investment set to rise.
Broad M4 money supply has remained in the bottom half of its 3% to 9%
monitoring range. M4 rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% last month to
give an unchanged annual rate of 4.5%. But in the latest three months
the annualised rate of growth was 4.9%.
The signs of a pick-up in M4 lending came at the end of a week in
which both retail and factory gate inflation were higher than expected,
retail sales were stronger, and unemployment fell sharply. The only
reassuring statistic was average earnings growth of 3.75% in both
October and November.
One City economist said that the case for a February increase in base
rates strengthened by the day.
Building society figures for December showed the usual seasonal drop
in lending, but an unexpected pickup in receipts.
Net new commitments fell back from #3190m in November to #2460m in
December, but were strong in relation to the #2090m committed in
December 1993.
Gross mortgage advances followed a similar pattern with December's
#2890m comparing with #3070m in November and #2710m in the previous
December.
Over the year as a whole net advances, which dropped from #1020m to
#623m in December, were 18% higher than in 1993. But this reflected
remortgaging activity as past fixed rate offers reached the end of their
terms, rather than the hoped for recovery in the housing market.
The societies recorded a net inflow of #694m in December after #301m
in November. It was the biggest monthly increase since May 1993 and was
mainly because of lower withdrawals, a big surprise given the usual
heavy expenditure in the run-up to Christmas. Greater use of credit
cards and the 1% rise in interest rates since September offer the most
likely explanations.

AS any parent will tell you, children under the age of 18 are
expensive. The cost of essentials such as food, clothing and
accommodation are usually met by the parents as it is unusual for
children to have income in their own right.
This is a pity, because for tax purposes children have the same rights
to a level of tax-free income and capital gains as an adult. The vast
majority of children do not use allowances which thus are wasted.
This is where grandparents come in. Parents can't simply transfer
assets which generate income to their children as such a transfer is
ineffective for income tax purposes (other than income of up to #100).
But grandparents can.
Any income which a child obtains from investments gifted to him by
anyone other than a parent are taxed on the child, and he can offset his
personal allowance against it.
If grandparents gift a sum of money which is deposited in a bank or
building society account, the child can register to have interest on the
account paid without tax being deducted at source (provided of course
his or her total income does not exceed the tax threshold).
For 1995-96 the amount of gross income a child can have without being
liable to income tax is #3525. It would probably require a deposit in
excess of #50,000 to generate this level of income which is more capital
than many people wish to see gifted outright to a young child. For those
who can afford to make gifts of this level one solution is to consider
setting up a trust for grandchildren.
Trusts are formal legal arrangements. A trust is made by giving a sum
of money to trustees who look after it on behalf of the beneficiaries of
the trust. Trustees can include anyone responsible, including the person
making the gift, and a suitable choice of trustee might include the
parents of the grandchild. The trustees cannot do what they like with
the money -- they must apply it as directed in the trust deed.
The trust deed is drawn up and signed when the trust is created and
its terms govern the operation of the trust. That makes the deed very
important, and in making a trust you need to specify exactly how and
when you wish both capital and income to be applied and what
restrictions you want to impose on how it is to be spent or invested.
You can give your trustees very wide powers of discretion in a trust
and they can go on looking after trust funds on behalf of beneficiaries
even after your death. You should employ a solicitor to help you draft
an appropriate trust deed and set it up.
Trusts can take several forms, each of which attracts different tax
treatment but the most common trust for grandchildren is the
accumulation and maintenance trust. There is a lot of scope for varying
the terms of this type of trust but commonly it will provide for the
grandchildren to start receiving the income of the trust automatically
in their own right at some future age -- 18, 21 or 25 are common
choices. Until that time the trustees can either accumulate the income,
pay it to the child or apply it for the child's benefit.
To qualify for the inheritance tax advantages mentioned below the
child must become entitled to the income on or before attaining age 25,
but there is no need for the trust to be wound up and the capital paid
to the child at the same time if you do not wish this to happen.
When the trustees receive income, the trust is liable to tax at a
total rate of 35%, credit being given for tax deducted at source. If,
however, they choose to pay the income to the grandchild or apply it for
the child's maintenance, the payment is treated as the child's income.
For example, if trustees pay #650 towards a child's school fees, the
child is treated as having gross income of #1000, credit being given for
the 35% tax the trustees will have suffered on the income paid. The
child can then set his or her personal allowance against this income and
ask the Inland Revenue to repay #350 of tax deducted from the trust
income.
Although complex and cumbersome, this process makes this type of trust
a very tax-efficient way of providing for grandchildren, particularly as
a means of funding school fees payments and other large income
expenditure. The child doesn't actually need to get possession of any
money as the trustees can make all the payments on his or her behalf. As
the trust can also be drawn up for more than one grandchild (including
grandchildren yet to be born) it can be a very flexible arrangement.
As well as the income tax advantages, an accumulation of maintenance
trust has inheritance tax advantages. The trust itself does not suffer
any inheritance tax charges while it is running or when it comes to an
end and capital is paid out.
This is true even if a beneficiary of the trust dies. And gifts into
the trust to set it up or add to it are treated as potentially exempt
just as a gift to an individual would be. This means that if you survive
seven years from the date of making the gift into trust it is free of
inheritance tax.
If the capital gifted grows in value either from wise investment or
because income is being accumulated, any growth is outwith the
grandparent's estate. This means that these trusts can also play a big
part in any inheritance tax planning that a grandparent wishes to
undertake.
Investing in the future . . . From the savings bank to trusts, there
are many avenues open to grandparents who wish to make provision for
their grandchildren.Picture: PAUL HACKETT

THE PEP selling season is on us again as investment groups compete to
persuade us to take out a PEP before the end of the tax year.
The vast majority of PEP schemes are sold in the three months before
the end of the tax year on April 5. This year the hype will continue
well into the new tax year with the launch of an entirely new generation
of PEPs which will be allowed to invest in corporate bonds.
Judy Delaforth of Fidelity, which already runs an international bond
fund, is convinced that corporate bond funds will be highly attractive
to investors.
''We think corporate bond PEPs will provide the missing link between
TESSAs and PEPs giving investors a stepping stone between a deposit
account and stock market investment,'' she said.
The idea is that people will build up a portfolio of tax-free
investments. This ideal investor will start by getting tax relief on a
bank or building society deposit account with a TESSA, graduate to a
corporate bond PEP which will offer a higher income but some risk,
before becoming a fully-fledged stock market investor through a PEP.
So far two unit trust groups, Clerical &amp; Medical and GT, have
announced their intention to launch corporate bond PEPs and both will
offer a high income -- 8% at Clerical &amp; Medical and 8.5% at GT.
However, Richard Eliott Lockhart of Glasgow-based unit trust manager
Murray Johnstone is concerned that investors may be seduced into these
new corporate bond PEPs without fully appreciating the risk. ''We do
think corporate bond PEPs are a useful half-way house between building
societies and equities, and we will launch a fund but the income will be
lower, between 5% and 7%.
''The high yields which are likely to be offered on these new PEPs are
only low risk if you believe that we have entered an era of permanent
low interest rates and low inflation. If on the other hand you think we
are at the bottom of the interest rate cycle and interest rates will go
up, then your capital isn't safe.
''Investors blame us for enticing them to invest at the top of the
stock market. I can see the same happening to these new corporate bond
PEPs if interest rates rise,'' he added.
The other danger is charges. Bond funds are not expensive to run, so
the annual charge is likely to be 1% or less compared with 1.5% for most
unit trusts. But these charges are likely to be paid out of capital
rather than income. Not a worry in the short term, but over time this
could erode the value of the fund.
Corporate bond PEPs were meant to go on sale in April at the beginning
of the next tax year, but the Inland Revenue is still consulting the
industry about which stocks should be included, so the timetable may
slip. The Inland Revenue's provisional list excludes eurobonds which
many blue-clip companies have issued in recent years.
Theodora Zemek, who runs M&amp;G's Sterling High Interest Fund, said that
the Inland Revenue doesn't like the eurobond market because it is
difficult to control. ''If you exclude eurobonds you are left with the
very small domestic corporate bond market and there is a danger that
demand from these new funds will drive up prices,'' he claims.
If M&amp;G and others in the industry persuade the Inland Revenue to allow
eurobond issues, there are a number of trusts, including the M&amp;G
Sterling High Interest Fund, which will become PEPable for the first
time.
Mike Ryder Richardson at S&amp;P is not convinced that the industry will
manage to convince the Inland Revenue to include eurobonds. S&amp;P
acknowledges that the domestic corporate bond market is small and in
some cases the stocks aren't even easy to trade.
''We intend getting round the problem by including a high proportion
of government stocks. A unit trust can have up to 50% in government
stocks without losing PEP status,'' he said.
''Our Extra Income Fund is split between shares and government stocks.
Any corporate bond fund will have a similar split between corporate
bonds and government stocks with 55% in corporate bonds and 45% in
government stocks,'' he added.

THE stock market seems to have started the year in a pretty indecisive
frame of mind.
The FTSE-100 share index is bobbing along around 300 points below its
best level of last year, despite a fair number of forecasts that this
year would see it rising to 3500.
If it achieves that level, and not everyone is confident that it will,
it will have managed a modest gain on top of recovering the fall of 10%
or so which it suffered last year.
Although a lot of fund managers regard the All-Share Index as the
benchmark for performance measurement, it seems right to pay a lot of
attention to the Footsie 100 because it accounts for more than 70% of
the market in terms of both capitalisation and activity.
It is an old saying that the Stock Exchange spends most of its time
making up its mind about which direction it wants to move and only a
small part of the year actually making that movement. Maybe that is why
people say timing is the essence of successful investment.
When I was a boy of about nine or 10 I had a neat little instrument
called a ''seebackroscope''. It was part of a junior detective's kit.
The idea was that while apparently looking forward you could put this
thing to one eye and see behind you. Using this technique on markets it
is often easy to spot when the mood changed from bull to bear or the
other way round, although it is not always so easy at the time.
Knowing where you are and where you have been is, however, quite a
useful start to working out where you are going. When the Stock Exchange
announced two new sub-divisions of the FTSE-350 Index (the Footsie 100
plus the Mid-250 stocks), one to show the state of shares with an
above-average yield and the other to log the below-average yield
counters, it pointed out that higher-yielding stocks had outperformed
the lower-yielding ones in six of the last eight years.
That, of course, does not give any indication of which way the market
is going but it was an interesting comment, particularly now that the
PEP market is likely to be concentrating attention even more heavily on
high-yielders alongside the soon-to-be-permitted bonds, convertibles and
preference shares. So much, however, for the seebackroscope.
Philip Wolstencraft, strategist at brokers Smith New Court, has
recently taken an interesting look at where we are now in terms of
ownership of the Footsie 100 stocks. Ownership is sometimes regarded as
something to be thought about seriously only when a company gets an
unwanted takeover bid and the directors need to look up who its
investors are and make urgent contact.
Investors, however, can also find ownership interesting. Wolstencraft
ferreted through the ownership lists of the top 100 companies compiled
by Citywatch which monitors the company registers in order to identify
the main under-weight and over-weight positions of the big UK
institutional investors in relation to the Footsie 100 index itself.
This, he commented, ''may help us to focus on the areas where there may
be a short squeeze''.
The logic would seem to be that with so many fund managers tracking
indices -- perhaps as much as 15% of UK pension money is managed this
way and the proportion is even higher in the US where the fashion
started -- a share price would respond quite noticeably if under or
over-weight positions were to be reversed.
Nothing is totally easy or straightforward and, as with so many things
to do with share markets, the information can be interpreted in two
ways. If the institutions are under-weight in a particular share does
that mean they will in time go to neutral or better weightings, one
could legitimately ask. Or does it mean that this is a share which is
likely to under-perform the rest of the pack? The opposite argument, of
course, applies to over-weightings.
But the fact that, having seen the weightings position, you still need
to do a bit of fundamental thinking about the anomaly shares before
buying or selling them, takes nothing away from the value of the
research. It is always useful to have somewhere to start from.
In relation to the benchmark, the most under-owned stocks in the
portfolios of the top 50 UK institutions are HSBC, BP, Sainsbury,
National Power and SmithKline Beecham. The most over-owned are
Commercial Union, Land Securities, Sun Alliance, General Accident and
MEPC.
The study notes that many of the under-owned stocks are in that
position because of large Government (National Power), family
(Sainsbury), or non-UK shareholders (HSBC). Excluding stocks where there
is a large existing non-institutional shareholder it shows the biggest
under-weight positions are held in BP, Hanson, Reuters, British Airways
and Boots.
In a separate study taking a strategist's look at 1995 and setting a
Footsie 100 target of 3500, he selects 10 stocks which in his view could
out-perform the market.
Commenting that he had been looking for shares which were ''cheap,
unloved, under-owned and yet are seeing evidence that profits and
dividends are not a disaster after all and might even be rising by more
than consensus expectations'', he picks BAT, British Airways, ICI, TSB
and United Biscuits from the Footsie 100, and BET, BPB, Hillsdown,
Vickers and WPP from the Mid-250.
Outside this selection one of the bigger Footsie stocks, Hanson, seems
to have been finding a few more friends recently. Smith New Court rated
as a hold but it does offer a fairly competitive yield of around 6%
against about 5% for the new higher yield index.

THE concept of independent financial advice was established by the
1986 Financial Services Act which is the cornerstone on which investment
regulation and investor protection in the UK is now based.
One of its main provisions was to polarise the financial services
market between tied and independent advisers. Tied agents can recommend
only the products provided by the company they are connected with.
In contrast independent advisers are bound by law to give objective
advice on the whole range of financial products available. They are not
employed by a company selling financial products so they have no
conflicts of interest.
It is now illegal to advise on investments without being properly
authorised. Scrupulous checks are made to ensure that every IFA is a
''fit and proper person'' to fulfil this role. Most will be members of
the Personal Investment Authority but IFAs such as accountants and
solicitors will be authorised through their own professional bodies.
All clients of IFAs are covered by compensation schemes run by
regulatory bodies. In addition IFAs must by law have professional
indemnity insurance.
They are required to conduct a complete fact-finding exercise, asking
about age, family circumstances, health and tax status, as well as
existing savings, investments and pension arrangements.
IFA Promotion was set up in 1989 to increase awareness of the value
and accessibility of independent financial advice. IFAs who are members
can be identified by the round blue pound-sign logo. Only independent
financial advisers may be members.
In choosing a financial adviser, there are five questions to ask
yourself:
* Is he-she technically competent, experienced in their field and if
he's aspecialist does that specialism fit your requirements?
* Is he/she enthusiastic and can you get on with him/her?
* Do you feel comfortable with him/her so you can build a rapport?
* Will you have continuity of contact with the same person and what
back-up services do they provide?
* Will payment be by commission or fee?
However the latter should not be the main consideration. The real
costs of financial products lie elsewhere.

FROM April 10 this year a new incapacity benefit will be introduced to
replace both sickness benefit and invalidity benefit. Not only will a
lower level of benefit be paid but stricter medical criteria will apply.
At present a single person earning #10,000 a year would be entitled to
#84.66 a week after 28 weeks of sickness. A married man earning #12,000
a year, with a non-working wife and two dependent children, would
receive #156.55 a week.
In April the amount payable will reduce to #57.60 a week for a single
person and #112.90 for the married man described above, and only after
52 weeks of illness. In the period from 29 weeks to 52 weeks they would
be paid 10% less..
These benefits would be payable regardless of what they earned before
falling ill.
It has been estimated that over the next three years as many as
280,000 claimants of the current invalidity benefit will fail the new,
more stringent medical test. Reductions in benefit levels for some could
be 40% and more.
There will be those who are unable to follow their own occupation due
to sickness but who will not qualify for any sickness benefits under a
medical test assessing incapacity on a stricter basis of whether the
claimant is able to carry on any occupation.
For employees who do not qualify for incapacity benefit but who cannot
carry on their own occupation, the only potential financial help from
the state is income support. This benefit will be paid in full only if
your savings are less than #3000.
At present there are more than a million people who have been away
from work through illness for more than six months, and there are more
than 500,000 who have not worked for medical reasons for more than three
years.
For the more devil-may-care people with no dependants, or the
well-insured family man who believes in a short life but a happy one,
the latest figures from the Department of Social Security show that 12
times as many people suffer from long-term illness or incapacity as die
prematurely.
Yet only an estimated 15% of the 20 million people who work full time
in Britain have income protection insurance.
''Some enlightened employers already have schemes which provide income
replacement for their employees who are off work for a very long time,
right up to the time when they would receive their pension,'' said Ken
Murray, of Campbell Smith Financial Services.
However, they are very much in the minority. Even those employed by
the Government, local authorities and the NHS have their incomes
protected for only 12 months.''
''Employees, or their representatives, should ask their employer
whether a scheme can be arranged for the staff, as this is undoubtedly
the most cost-effective way of providing this security,'' said Murray.
''However if this is not acceptable it is usually possible, dependent
on health and type of employment, to buy this protection for yourself.''
This type of insurance can be expensive, but is much less so if you
arrange it before middle age. The cost of premiums can be reduced by
extending the period you will wait before benefits become payable.
''There are many types of income protection insurance,'' said Murray.
''Some have severe restrictions on when and how benefits are payable.
Added to this are wide differences in costs.''
The chart shows the difference in costs between the highest and lowest
premiums to produce #500 per month benefit after 26 weeks incapacity.
Murray added: ''Can you afford to take the risk of not securing your
income.''?

* In November 1986, I was talked into investing #10,000 with Hill
Samuel Unit Trust Management Service with instructions to reinvest
income and with capital growth as the objective.
Since then my fund has been managed in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh,
and now back again to London. Despite all the whiz-kids who have had a
go, the valuation today is only #12,749. The income does not even cover
the management fee.
I appreciate that it is a long-term investment, but I feel eight years
is a fair time and I feel their performance is very poor compared to
other company products you have mentioned from time to time. I would be
most grateful for your advice. I also have PEPs and a fair portfolio of
equities.
* In November 1986 the FTSE-100 Share Index traded on either side of
1650, and in recent times it has been mainly above 3000. This suggests
capital appreciation of over 80% in blue chips before allowing for the
reinvestment of dividends.
In the case of your unit trust portfolio the growth over eight years
is a miserable 27.5%. In other words your investment would appear to
have under-performed the market in excess of 50%.
Eight years is more than enough time to give an investment to justify
its existence, especially when the evidence of under-performance is so
strong.
You should not hesitate to dispose of it an early date. You have not
given us any clues as to the value of your portfolio of equities and
PEPs, but unless it runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds, #12,750
seems a lot to allocate to one investment.
In reinvesting the funds we suggest that you spread the money around a
bit. If your equity investments have done well you might like to add to
these, or if there are gaps in your portfolio you might like to plug
some of these.
If you have a regular stockbroker he would doubtless be glad to advise
you on the best use of the funds realised from selling these unit
trusts.

* I have a number of pension arrangements and I understand it is not
possible to have a personal pension plan and be a member of a company
pension scheme. I would like some clarification over this.
My situation is that I have two separate part-time jobs. In one I am a
member of the pension scheme and with the other there is no employer
scheme so I have a personal pension policy. On top of these I have two
frozen pensions from previous employers. Am I right in thinking than I
can have these various policies?
* The rule is that you are not allowed to have a personal pension plan
and be a member of a pension scheme if you have just the single
employer. However, each employment is considered separately and you are
quite in order in being a member of a company scheme in respect of one
employment and have a personal pension scheme in respect of the other,
so long as total contributions do not exceed the statutory maximum.
In addition you can have any number of deferred pensions from previous
employers, or alternatively you can take a transfer value into the
present company or personal schemes.
* For convenience my wife and I prefer to have our building society
accounts in joint names. For the year ending April 1995 my wife's
grossed-up total income might exceed the 25% limit of #27,145, while
following my recent retirement mine will be far short of #28,865.
What is the time limit for electing for building society interest to
be split other than 50/50 and how does one go about it?
* For the benefit of other readers, the figures you quote represent
the 1994-95 basic rate band of #23,700 plus the personal allowances of
#3445 and also in your case the married couples allowances of #1720.
Income from assets held in joint names will normally be split equally
for tax purposes but where the actual beneficial interest in the asset
and the income from it are unequal, a couple can make a declaration to
that effect. This means that where the couple invested unequal amounts
of capital, they can request that the income arising is assessed in
proportion.
The Inland Revenue consider that this option does not apply to bank or
building society accounts held jointly. Income from such accounts is
always taxed as income to which you are entitled in equal shares and
part of your joint capital in your own name.
For the other assets, the declaration must be made on a Form 17
obtainable from the tax offices and it is effective from the date the
form is signed, provided it is sent to the Inland Revenue within 60
days.

* I have taken the plunge and decided to change my bank. Friends have
told me it is a horrendous task and I am sure many things will go wrong,
particularly as I have a lot of standing orders and direct debits on my
present account.
Can you give any tips about how to avoid chaos?
* The most important points are the obvious ones -- don't close the
existing account until the new one is fully up and running and ensure
there is enough money in the new account to allow the regular payments
to be made. The process does require quite a lot of work.
First of all the new account has to be opened and the date for the
switch selected, allowing at least two months. Ask your current bank for
a print-out of your direct debits and standing orders.
You need to write to all the beneficiaries of your direct debits
asking for new forms and return these, giving details of the new account
with a covering note stating the date the new ones should take effect.
The instruction has to come from the beneficiary as the bank itself
cannot alter direct debit instructions, unlike standing orders. You can,
however, cancel direct debits and you should instruct your present bank
to do so from the switch date.
For the standing orders, sign the list and send it to the new bank for
implementation from the appropriate date. Send a copy back to your
existing bank and ask it to cancel them.
Don't forget to tell your employer, pension scheme or other providers
of payments into your account of the change. Provide full details of the
new account, including number and sort code.
Banks are keen to attract new custom and may offer packs to help you
and may even offer to handle the various transfers. However, the
Consumers' Association suggests you are more certain things will not go
wrong if you do this yourself.
Several weeks after the change you should request statements from both
accounts to ensure it has been done currently and then you can close the
former account.
* I have a question on the 20p tax on the first #3000 of taxable
income. As a 70-year-old married pensioner I have so arranged by income
from savings that I can take gross income from building societies except
for one account which I receive net, and stay within my allowances so
that I do not pay tax on my small company pension.
My question is -- can the building society which pays me net income be
advised to tax this income at 20% or will I have to wait a year and
claim a rebate from the tax man?
* As far as your own situation is concerned, it appears from the
details you have provided that your total annual income exceeds your tax
allowances and therefore you should not have registered with the
building society as a non-taxpayer even though only part of the interest
received may be liable to tax.
You can only arrange for interest to be paid without deduction of tax
if you are not completely liable, that is, if your total taxable income
is less than your total tax allowances.
* I read recently that Norwich Union is now only doing unitised
with-profits policies. Can you explain how these differ from
conventional endowment policies and if they have any disadvantages.
* More and more life offices are offering unitised with-profits
policies. There is essentially no difference between the two, it is more
a question of presentation.
Premiums paid under unitised policies go towards buying units, the
price of which is published. This makes it easier for the investor to
have an idea of how the policy is progressing as the price of the units
is published.
It is difficult to assess this with a normal endowment policy, though
of course the surrender value can be ascertained on request.
The value of the units is an approximation of the surrender value of
the unitised policy, though this has to be treated with caution because
life offices often apply a ''market value adjustment'' to the face value
to reflect the investment outlook. This adjustment can vary
significantly, as can surrender values in conventional policies.
Unitised policy statements make it easier to assess the level of
charges and the policies have the advantage of enabling switching
between other funds the life office may offer. Switching out may also
attract a market value adjustment.
There are certain technical differences between the policies.
Conventional policies have a guaranteed sum assured on which bonuses are
declared. Unitised policies have a guaranteed death benefit and bonuses
are declared on the units. It is a subtle difference but it means that
unitised policies generally require lower capital commitments from the
life office.
In theory this should make them perform better as the office will be
free to put more into risk investments such as equities. In addition the
cost of bonuses on unitised policies are less in the early years.
* I am single, a basic rate taxpayer and live in my parents' home.
Apart from an instant access building society account which is used for
short-term savings, I have #10,000 in blue-chip company shares, #5000 in
smaller company shares and #3000 in unit trusts.
I also have #15,000 in Allied Dunbar insurance bonds, split evenly
between Equity, American Equity, Overseas, Far East and Managed
accounts.
In the long term would I be better to cash in my insurance bonds and
invest more in equities or do you see any advantage in holding on to
these bonds?
* On a number of occasions in these columns we have made the point
that insurance bonds do not in general perform as well as investment and
unit trusts from the point of view of capital growth.
Your other investments seem to be designed to yield capital growth.
Given that your total portfolio is worth #33,000, #15,000 seems a lot to
allocate to one investment, albeit that it is spread around a number of
funds with the same manager.
Taking a long-term view you would increase your chances of capital
growth by disposing of your insurance bonds. It is less clear that you
should reinvest the proceeds directly in equities.
You might be better allocating at least some of the funds to a number
of investment trusts which are ideal vehicles for providing the small
investor with capital growth without taking undue risks.
We are intrigued by the fact that you have #5000 invested in the
shares of smaller companies. This can be a very lucrative field, but the
risks are greater than in the case of blue chips. Stock selection is,
therefore, crucial.
To get round this some investors buy shares in investment or unit
trusts specialising in smaller companies. Such funds are able to spread
the risk more widely than any private investor could and most have
considerable expertise in their chosen field.
You might like to consider this option at a time when you are taking a
critical look at your existing portfolio of interests.
* In order to reduce possible inheritance tax liability I wish to
transfer my shareholdings in the various privatisations to my
grandchildren who are all under 18 years old.
Is it possible to have their names added on a ''trust'' basis and in
so doing would the value be discounted on my assets on death?
Also, as all dividends would then be paid into their bank accounts
would the tax be reclaimable?
* Any share transferred would be valued for any future tax liability
at the value on the day of transfer. It can be written in the form of a
trust though you may need to take legal advice on this.
However, any value above the #3000-a-year annual gift allowance would
be included in the estate and liable to tax if you died within seven
years of transfer.
The tax on the dividends would be reclaimable provided the child's
income did not exceed the children's allowance of #3445, rising to #3525
in the next financial year.
* My daughter is being married in the summer of this year and my
husband and I would like to give #15,000 to her. Would it be best to
gift a certain amount now, before the end of this tax year, and the
remainder after April 5?
In addition to the amount one can normally gift, I understand that
there is an additional amount one can gift as a wedding present.
* It should be possible for you and your husband to gift #15,000 to
your daughter before April 5, 1995, without any exposure to a future
inheritance tax charge.
Parents can each gift #5000 in consideration of a marriage which is
fully exempt. You should make it clear that this gift is in
contemplation of the marriage and conditional on it taking place.
In addition, you and your husband can use your annual exemption of
#3000 each (and indeed if you have not already used it you can add to
this the same exemption carried forward from 1993-94).
By splitting the gift between you these exemptions will cover the
amount you wish to give away.

THE most crucial investment decision you can make is where you go for
advice. For the most expensive form of financial advice is receiving the
wrong advice.
Since January 1 new rules from the Securities and Investment Board
have laid down that anyone selling life cover or a similar product such
as a pension or savings plan will have to reveal exactly how much they
will earn from the insurance company for that sale.
Independent financial advisers come under these rules but in fact they
have all been doing so since at least July 1 last year and many for much
longer.
The biggest difference the new rules have made is that tied agents --
salesmen selling the products of just one company -- will have to
disclose what they earn from a sale too.
For them, however, commission is effectively profit. For an
independent financial adviser it is income that goes towards paying for
his overheads, such as his office, training, the latest information, and
so on. How else could he be independent?
Discussion about commission, though, obscures a more important point:
commission is a small part of the price of life cover or a pension or
savings plan.
Management charges are far more likely to take a bite out of your
money. An analysis in 1993 of the costs associated with a typical
building society regular savings plan, for example, shows that 46% of
the deductions made go towards management expenses, 25% towards
provisions for bad debts on mortgages, 13% towards tax, and 16% towards
profits.
Safe though the plan might seem, it is not without risks. Inflation
may erode the value of your investment, your circumstances may change
forcing you to cash in early and the interest rate is totally at the
society's discretion.
Over 25 years the effect of total deductions could amount to #26,000
and the return on #100 invested per month would be #58,000, assuming an
average growth of 7.5% a year.
With the same amount of money invested in an endowment plan from one
of the better-performing insurance companies, the effect of deductions
would be nearly #10,000 less at #16,300 and the plan would deliver to
you #66,500, assuming the same rate of growth at 7.5% a year.
True, if you cash in early with the regular savings plan, you would
also have paid in #1200 and you would receive back #1230.
At the end of the first year of the endowment plan, you would also
have paid in #1200 but you might get back only #1100. Neither plan is
suited to short-term savings, however.
This is where the full benefit of finding the right independent
financial adviser can show. Instead of worrying about a few pounds in
commission now, you should be concerned about finding an adviser you
feel comfortable with.
If you feel you can talk freely to him or her, you will find it easier
to discuss matters which, though not at first sight financial, could
have an effect on your financial needs.
It could be there is someone you have met you might want to marry in a
few years' time; or that, although your friends laugh at the idea, you
would really like to travel around the world five years from now; or
that your teenage son has a plan for his own business when he has
finished training and you would like to help him if you had a little
cash to spare.
That kind of relationship will help your adviser to help you avoid the
penalties of terminating unsuitable financial products early.
This is only one example of how the real price of choosing a financial
product that is not the best for you can come to be paid when you most
need the benefits of that financial product. If you have chosen the
wrong one, the benefits you receive will be dramatically worse.
It costs no more to use an independent insurance company, because the
charges within the insurance contracts are designed assuming commission
will be paid.
In other words, if a customer approached the company direct the
insurance company would keep the commission for themselves.
As one specialist pensions company, National Mutual Life, has
explained: ''After you have taken your IFA's advice, commission is
payable only once you have contributed to a policy. There is no
advantage in an individual dealing directly with National Mutual Life.
This is because without the involvement of an IFA there would be
additional work for National mutual Life to undertake.
''What does the commission pay for? As with the running of any
business, there are numerous costs in providing a complete review of
your financial affairs and in transacting your business: market
research, legal requirements, training of staff, technology and
administration, overheads such as rent, heating, lighting, etc.''
Because of that an IFA can open up a range of choices that you
probably never suspected existed.''Tied agents can recommend only the
products provided by the company they are connected with,'' said Andrew
Robertson, regional officer of IFA Promotion which represents Britain's
15,000 independent financial advisers.
''Independent advisers, however, are not only able to provide
objective advice upon a whole range of products available in the
marketplace, they have an obligation to under the law. The distinction
is very important. Anyone buying an endowment policy, for example, will
have well over 100 companies to choose from, each offering a wide range
of contracts which, on the face of it, may seem very similar.''
They may appear similar but the end result of choosing one over
another can be very striking. ''For no additional cost you can have the
advice of an IFA and you will get added value to the insurance
contract,'' said Ailsa Brown, of Neilson Brown &amp; Co based in Busby near
Glasgow.
''You may find the contract cheaper because of that advice, either
through cheaper premiums or through being with a better performing fund.
An IFA will recommend the product best suited to the individual's needs,
including flexibility for the future, premium rates, fund performance,
charging structure, company administration and special offers.''
Another IFA, Ken Murray, of Campbell Smith Financial Services in
Greenock, prepared charts to show just how much the returns could differ
between insurance policies.
The bars on the chart for with-profit pension fund returns shows the
lowest, the average and the highest funds in each time period looked at,
based on a gross premium of #200 per month.
Over five years there is little difference between. By the 10-year
mark they are clearly separating out. After 15 years there are several
thousand pounds between the value of each one and after 20 years more
than #15,000 separates the highest from the lowest.
In the bar chart showing the cost of #50,000 life insurance cover for
a man up to the age of 65, the difference in the monthly cost of
premiums is marked at any age, but for a 50-year-old it is #20 a month.
As Ailsa Brown commented on Ken Murray's graphic illustrations : ''The
highest cost is that of not taking independent financial advice. How
much will it cost if you select the wrong company, or the wrong fund
through lack of knowledge?
''How much additional tax will you be paying if you put your money
into the wrong type of investment? How much worse off will your
dependants be if they select the wrong type of protection policy?
''An independent financial adviser is the only person who has to
choose the most suitable investment for you from the hundreds available
today. Any other source of advice is tied to just one company and they
will recommend only the most suitable contract offered by their employer
or the company they represent.
''It is not always appreciated that they cannot advise on other
companies' investments and must therefore disregard them, even
performance record.''

MORE than six million people in Britain began 1995 with a New Year
resolution which had something to do with their finances, according to
research commissioned by the independent financial advisers' body IFA
Promotion.
Nearly half of them will be saving for a specific item this year while
just more than one-third resolved to spend less. A quarter want to clear
debts and one in 10 want to sort out their retirement and pension
planning.
Among the well-known names with financial resolutions are television
interviewer and presenter of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Sue Lawley,
who wants to stick to her budgets this year, presumably without having
to go to a desert island herself.
Linford Christie intends to look more closely at his retirement plans,
even though -- or perhaps because -- his athletic career is remarkable
for its longevity as its records.
Rugby's Will Carling has resolved to spend less this year as has Mike
Atherton, especially on match fines.
Research for IFA Promotion showed that more than #10m of Britain's 45
million adults are aware that their financial affairs are badly planned
and they need professional help.
That suggests that at least four million people who have not yet made
a financial resolution for 1995 should really do so. For the rest of
this month independent financial advisers who are members of IFA
Promotion will offer half-hour, no obligation consultation.
Details of three participating IFAs in your area are available by
ringing 0483 461461, or you can look for the blue roundel logo with the

WITHIN the next few weeks, many greenhouses will be brought into
action again. This is especially true for those of us with the
increasingly popular propagating cabinets. They can provide a vital
localised warmth for rooting cuttings, or sowing early seeds -- and at
minimum cost.
One of the many problems is the way in which moss, algae and dirt gets
a hold and settles on the glass. It has a profound effect on light.
Indeed, you may find that the glass is so cloudy that transmission is
reduced greatly. Good light is vital to growth.
Poor light will also seriously affect growth of seedlings or rooted
cuttings, in propagating cases in the greenhouse. The answer is, of
course, to give the glass a thorough clean both inside and out.
It is a lot easier at this time of year when it is relatively empty of
plants and those inside can be moved out on a favourable day, for an
hour or two. One of the problems facing keen greenhouse gardeners who
wish to clean up is that they may have used bubble polythene for lining
in order to conserve heat.
It makes access to the inside glass difficult, and is one of the great
drawbacks of this lining. Many gardeners are of the opinion that the
polythene lasts only a limited time, as it tends to go cloudy and has
the effect of reducing light transmission.
They don't put the lining on until February or March, after a thorough
cleansing of the greenhouse. For cleaning the glass, you can use a
variety of materials, such as Jeyes Fluid, Armillatox, or strong
detergents.

IN the vegetable section of a supermarket the other day, I was
reminded that it is time to decide where, when, and what we are going to
do about vegetables this season.
Interest has reduced somewhat in recent years, especially with
year-round availability in stores and supermarkets. I have been growing
vegetables for a long time, however, and my wife and family would
complain bitterly if I stopped.
Let's look realistically and systematically at vegetables to see what
is worth growing, and when.
Artichoke: could be grown more than they are. Easy to produce from
seed, sown in April. Likes good soil and a bit of shelter if their
fleshy scales are to be succulent.
Asparagus: at its best in light sandy soil in a coastal area. Grow a
male-only variety. Sow seed in April. It will be three years before you
get a decent harvest. Beware its spreading habits.
Aubergine: likes warmth. Best grown under glass in Scotland, or a very
warm sunny position out of doors.
Beetroot: a must. Delightful when pickled. Do on most soils. Sow in
May and thin to an inch or so apart.
Broccoli (sprouting): takes up a lot of room. May not produce heads
until the following spring. Try calabrese, and deep freeze.
Brussels sprouts: an essential, in a dwarf variety. Sow seed under
cover in March. Plant out in April or May. Beware of clubroot, although
they are more resistant than other brassicas.
Cabbage: easy to grow from seed sown from March on. Plant out in May
or even June. Very susceptible to clubroot. Beloved by caterpillars.
Grow some early and some late. Very tasty in winter.
Chinese cabbage: excellent new varieties, easier to grow. Don't sow
until May. Rather like a large lettuce.
Calabrese: essential. Sow seed under glass in March, Plant out from
May on. What you don't eat, you can freeze for later.
Carrot: grow best in lighter soils and prone to carrot fly. Well worth
sowing seed, in April.
Cauliflower: grow if you have a rich soil. Otherwise, forget it.
Especially with clubroot around. Can be badly troubled with cabbage
butterfly.
Celeriac: rather unusual. Easy to grow. Sow in April in good land.
Celery: self-blanching variety easy to grow. Blanching types require a
lot of work. Sow seed in greenhouse in late March to early April. Plant
out in May. Well worth growing.
Cucumbers: pick an all-female variety. They do well in growbags under
glass, but require regular training and support.
Endive: becoming more popular as substitute for lettuce in autumn. Sow
seed direct, April to June.
Herbs: a section of garden can be put aside. Most can be produced from
seed.
Kale: a hardy winter vegetable, always tasty in frosty days. Grow as
for cabbage. You don't need to worry too much about clubroot.
Kohl rabbi: rather like a turnip, with swollen stems. Easy to grow, if
sown direct, April to May.
Leek: no garden should be without them. Sow seed in March to early
April, under glass. Plant out in May to June. Even buy a few plants.
They like rich soil. Don't skimp in that department.
Lettuce: some people can't grow lettuce. Failure often comes from root
aphids. Some excellent aphis-resistant varieties, like Avondefiance.
Different types, include red-leaved varieties. All are at their best in
rich soil, well supplied with lime and moisture.
Marrow: sow seed in warmth, in March or April. Plant out in May. Sow
direct in May in sheltered locality. Always worth having for the local
flower show.
Melons: by all means grow them, in spare space in the greenhouse. They
will need support.
Onions: remarkably easy to grow. Always welcome. Spring onions great
for salads. Bigger ones good for frying, or for soup. Sow spring onions
direct from April on. Bulb onions, sow seed under glass in March or
April. Plant out when large enough, or buy in sets. They need relatively
rich and well-dug soil.
Parsley: a must. Sow under glass in March or April to plant out. Grow
some in pots for lifting in under protection in the autumn.
Parsnip: sticky or heavy soil won't do. Best to take out holes with
crowbar, fill with sand, and sow seed direct in April.
Radish: very easy. Not fussy about soil. Sow in succession from April
on. Look out for flea beetle and slugs.
Spinach: well worth it for high protein. Sow in succession from April
onwards.
Swede turnips: essential. Sow seed in April. Can be troubled by flea
beetle.
Sweet corn: difficult to ripen fully. Sow under glass in April. Plant
out in May to June in sheltered bed. Needs support.
Tomato: great in greenhouse or plastic structure. Can be grown in
borders where soil has not been repeatedly cropped with tomatoes, or is
well sterilised. Many opt for growbags or growpots. Sow seed in March.
Peas and beans: broad beans easy to grow. What you can't eat, you can
freeze. Relatively trouble free. Peas easy to grow but often fade out
due to foot root, causing plants to yellow. Start sowing both, in April
in well-limed land. Move them around the garden. Dwarf French beans are
simple to grow. No real bother. Runner beans need warmth.
Potatoes: potato cyst eelworm, and slugs, are the scourge. You should
get away with earlies, or a resistant variety but beware, late crops can
be ruined by slugs.

GLASGOW-based marine outfitters Rowan &amp; Boden, a name that harks back
to the halcyon days of Clydeside shipbuilding, has gone into
receivership.
Joint receivers Frank Blin and Ian Rankin, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, will
continue the business in the short-term, with potential buyers having
expressed interest in some parts of the 90-year-old company before their
appointment.
Rowan &amp; Boden, whose business has changed with the times, employs
about 80 people and has operations in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh,
Manchester and Gateshead.
The contract flooring, furnishing sales and marine outfitting firm,
which had recently expanded into contract furnishing for the healthcare
industry, laid the decks on great Clyde-built liners like the Queen
Mary.
Since its heyday as a marine specialist, Rowan &amp; Boden has been
responsible for contracts in on-shore locations, like Glasgow's Hilton
Hotel and Edinburgh's Cafe Royal. It also runs a subsidiary which
supplies plastic marine hardware.
In 1993, Scot Allan Cloggie bought Rowan &amp; Boden, which was once
listed on the Stock Exchange, from Yorkshire parent company GM. Firth
for #1.5m. The deal was supported by Bank of Scotland.
In the previous financial year, Rowan &amp; Boden had incurred a pre-tax
loss of #51,000, on turnover of #6.2m. It had net assets of #750,000.
The receivers were unavailable for comment and a spokesman for Coopers
&amp; Lybrand said they had nothing to add to a brief press statement which
indicated they were hopeful of an early sale to interested parties.

<HEADLINE>Q here for chips with the added flavour</HEADLINE>

THE market is agog over Project Q, the code name for the new potato
chip that Park Foods will launch this summer and which could take the
fast food market by storm.
After eight years work by an unnamed inventor who once worked for
McCains, one of the largest suppliers of frozen chips, the Q has added
flavour throughout rather than being ''robed'' with the added taste only
on the surface as is the case with existing products. It has the added
benefits of being 100% natural, high fibre and fat free.
Park chairman Peter Johnson says that one of two High Street food
retailers intend having separate takeaway sections in their shops where
the customer can chose smokey bacon or garlic and chives -- or whatever
is the flavour of choice. The chip can be fried from frozen in just 60
seconds. Initial production is planned at 60 tonnes a day and the
product will be licensed throughout Europe.
Unfortunately, Park does not have the US rights where Burger King
asked for a 140 ton sample.
This could develop into a profit generator more substantial than the
core hamper business where Park has a 40% share of the UK market. In the
half year to September, turnover rose 62% to #18.7m because of the
acquisition chiefly of Heritage hampers -- the underlying inprovement
was 14%.
As usual there was a hefty interim loss, up slightly at #5m. However
Christmas was excellent with customer spend up 11% to #168.50 per
hamper, an increase in agents to 90,000 with the average contribution up
nearly 8% at #1454. This is a weekly savings club operation where there
is no credit risk which results in Park having very substantial cash
balances throughout the year averaging about #40m. Hampers for the 1995
Christmas are priced at almost #180 and the indications are that volume
is moving ahead well above last year's levels.
The non-hamper side includes promotional handling for major companies
such as Coca-Cola, Brooke Bond and Smithkline Beecham. Park also
supplies passenger travel kits for British Airways and is now involved
in the airline's Interactive Services where a passenger can order goods
in-flight for delivery to destination of choice.
Full-year profits should inprove from #11.8m to about #16m which would
leave the shares at 123p trading at 17 times likely earnings -- Mr
Johnson's own stake is worth a staggering #129m.
The interim dividend is 20% higher at 1p with a 4p total probable for
a 4% yield. This is a soundly based company with exellent potential if Q
really does take off.

DESPITE the short distance in terms of miles, Edinburgh and Glasgow
apparently have very distinct ideas about style, even when it comes to
kitchens.
While the East Coast continues to favour a more traditional approach
in terms of layout, design and materials used, the West Coast appears to
be more adventurous. Whatever the geographical location, the bottom line
for everyone is quality and value for money.
At this time of year, the marketplace is saturated with special offers
and new ideas, but with the cost of installing a new kitchen generally
running into thousands of pounds, and since it is unlikely to be changed
in the immediate future, it is important for prospective buyers to get
what they want.
Ideally, potential buyers should shop around, looking at as many
showroom displays, and compile as much pricing information as possible
to help decide which options to consider.
When it comes to making the right choice, many people are likely to
rely on recommendation by friends. Seeing a good job done is often a
better way of judging a product than starting from scratch with no prior
knowledge.
Most kitchen specialists will talk customers through various options,
advising on finishes and styles, and will go out to the client's home to
survey and examine the area to be used in terms of size, colour, light
and usage.
As Elaine Cowan of Cameron Interiors explained, it is often possible
to create any desired effect with a little adaptation: ''If it happens
to be a very cold, dull room, we would tend to recommend that the people
don't go for something blue, for example, or something that is too dark.
But you can get away with a lot these days with mid-lighting and
over-shelf lighting, so even if it is a small room, you are not
restricted to a light colour.''
Like many other kitchen specialists, Cameron Interiors is a member of
KSA, the Kitchen Specialists Association which exists to promote
professionalism and excellence in the design, supply and installation of
fitted kitchens.
Membership of the association isn't easy -- over 50% of applicants for
membership are rejected. Everybody undergoes strict financial checks to
make sure their business is sound. Standards of workmanship are also
vetted thoroughly. Only if the kitchen retailers maintain the highest
standards are they accepted as members of the KSA.
Because of the vetting procedure all members have to go through prior
to acceptance, the KSA can offer consumers the security of an unique,
insurance-backed, deposit protection scheme entitled KSA-ConsumerCare,
if they order their kitchen, bedroom, or bathroom fro a KSA member.
For most people, buying a new kitchen is a balance of choosing what
they like in terms of design while at the same time considering the
practicality of the materials used, so the decision tends to be based on
a mixture of what they like and what works functionally.
In the case of people with young families, for example, using textures
like high gloss and stainless steel need not be a problem when it is
concentrated in areas less likely to be reached by sticky fingers.
People have varying priorities when it comes to deciding what they
want, and the design will very much depend on how the room is used, and
how they cook. Some people like to incorporate areas for eating as well
as supervising children doing homework. Nowadays, the kitchen is often
one of the most used rooms in the house and is multi-purpose.
In 1995, additional lighting has become a very important feature. So
has the integration of appliances. With the move away from free standing
equipment, it is also becoming increasingly common for work surfaces to
be in one piece.
New products which have come onto the market recently will also make
kitchens more streamlined.
Corion is one such innovation which is growing in popularity. A new
worktop material, it is a type of seamless man-made marble, it is
non-porous, hygenic and comes in a wide range of colours. Being cool, it
is ideal for food preparation.
Coloured laminates are also popular, especially in the West. Examples
of aquamarine tones mixed with warm light wood finishes are not
uncommon, especially in kitchens where the design incorporates more
furniture.
If the quality of the product has improved in 1995 then so has the
calibre of those involved in creating kitchens. Today, there are experts
in the field of kitchen design who can custom-build a kitchen,
tailor-making it to the specific needs of the client.
Expertise in fitting kitchens has also grown, with the use of
experienced and skilled joiners, plumbers, tilers and so on, essential.
It is difficult for most people to coordinate the fitting of a
kitchen, making sure that the various contractors arrive at the right
time. Without experience, this can be a nightmare and many people are
happy to leave such juggling to the experts who can supply the whole
package.
Said Elaine Cowan: ''Good design will only be carried through properly
if those involved are used to working with the product, and work to a
high standard. They have to be able to deal with problems on site.''

RAYMOND Blin, who built up accountancy firm Pannell Kerr Forster in
Scotland, is to step down as managing partner earlier than planned
Mr Blin, whose brother Frank heads up big five firm Coopers &amp;
Lybrand's Glasgow operation, will be succeeded by long-time colleague
and fellow partner Bryan Jackson.
The changeover, according to Mr Blin, had originally been planned for
April 1996. However, because of recent business initiatives, Mr Blin
said he would be stepping down as PKF's top man in Scotland at some
point between May 1 and July 1 this year.
While remaining a partner, Mr Blin will also act as managing director
of three joint venture companies formed by PKF to help them through what
they believe will be a traumatic time for the profession, which is
facing fierce competition from banks and management consultants.
The three new companies, PLC Business Expansion Advisors, Format F and
Inside Out, will respectively help clients obtain finance, advise on
franchising and apply sport coaching techniques to help businesses
obtain results.
Olympic hopeful Melanie Neef, the Scottish 200m indoor record holder,
and Welsh national rugby team coach Alan Davies are among the
high-profile names on Inside Out's payroll.
Like his brother, Mr Blin is one of Scotland's leading insolvency and
corporate recovery practitioners. He has been managing partner of PKF in
Glasgow, which now has 130 staff and nine partners, for 11 years.
Referring to PKF's three new ventures, Mr Blin said: ''They need my
focused time and managing the practice takes time as well. It was really
Bryan's turn. It is giving both of us an opportunity to do different
things and is really just a switch of emphasis.''

THE newest look for kitchens swings away from fitted urban conformity,
to favour instead, freestanding pieces in solid wood with a fresh,
country feel which epitomises now.
Equally at home in a city setting or rural cottage, the trend is
typified by Habitat's custom-made cabinet in solid wood, introduced this
winter. Already apparently, the pieces are amongst their bestsellers.
Take their Oliva range, for example. Made of light beech wood with
quality metal grab-style handles, it includes a host of pieces which
will also marry happily with products from the company's other ranges --
to provide the more individual, eclectic kitchen sought by many today.
Perhaps it is a rebellion against the very tailored, uniform kitchens
of the past couple of decades. It probably began with the increasing
popularity of ranges featuring woods -- natural, distressed, limed or
whatever, signalling a desire to step back from hi-tech kitchens and
cool minimalism, into more welcoming, comfortable (and comforting) rooms
which took their inspiration from simpler, more sincere generations.
It is no accident that such kitchens have followed on the heels of
women casting aside the power-dressing syndrome.
But there is another bonus with this type of kitchen furniture; it is
totally portable. If you move, it moves too. It also has the advantage
of being capable of re-arranging if you wish, so that the room can
change its look or function, without radical upheaval and considerable
expense.
Whether the range offers the kind of storage and configuration you
require -- or even the looks -- is a matter for individuals to
ascertain. But if your taste runs to Agas and rocking chairs, it's
likely that you'll love its earthy, solid homeliness.
As far as that most practical of pieces of kitchen furniture is
concerned, the kitchen sink, the Oliva range offers a double sink
console unit at #549, with an optional ceramic sink/drainer at #290. My
only criticism of the latter is that it is far too small -- a fault
which seems to be remarkably common amongst many sink ranges today.
Clearly, those who design such products are not in the habit of
struggling to clean a large grill or jam pan in the impossible confines
of these mini-sinks.
That apart, it is not surprising to hear that the new Habitat kitchen
concept is developing a strong following. But it doesn't stop there.
Tying in with the small glass-doored wall storage units, which can
also be stacked into a distinctive ''tallboy'' feature, is a wood tall
storage cupboard at #549; a console table with two drawers, and a
low-level open storage shelf, at #599. Then there's an Oliva kitchen
table, plain and unpretentious, at #499, and a two-tiered solid wood
trolley for free-wheeling mobility, at #149
But the beauty of this growing trend is that, perhaps at its most
attractive, it is not dependent on total coordination of closely related
items. Indeed, one could argue that it is the harmonious mixing of
compatible furniture and accessories, without a trace of archness or
twee, that provides the fresh simplicity of its appeal.

WHEN I was but knee-high to a copy boy, my mother had two expressions
the very utterance of which would send me quivering with fear behind the
nearest sofa, such was the vicious mercilessness with which they were
mentioned. The first was nyaff, meaning the kind of ne'er-do-well who
would cheek his elders, steal from old-age pensioners, or put a young
lady up the junction (it was a rough neighbourhood). The second was
snash, meaning a worthless or facetious remark, usually dispensed by a
nyaff in the process of cheeking his elders, stealing from old-age
pensioners, and so on.
The Proustian power of memory is such that, in my dotage, only things
of exceptional worthlessness or facetiousness qualify in my mind for
this ultimate put-down. The arguments of born-again Christians: they are
snash. The collected works of the Beat Poets: they are snash. And Wolf,
starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer: it is snash.
Perhaps it would be more precise to say that it is rubbish. Absolute
howling, shivering, barking-at-the-moon, 24-carat codswallop. But a very
specific kind of codswallop that evokes a very particular form of
disappointment -- the kind of disappointment that generally can only be
achieved by putting on your coat, going to a cinema, and paying good
money to witness any film starring either Steve Martin or Goldie Hawn.
That kind of cheap, vapid
what-did-I-do-for-the-last-two-hours-of-my-life? disappointment.
The fact that the most memorable scene in Wolf (rental, cert 15)
involves Jack Nicholson urinating on a colleague's shoes gives you an
idea of the depressing, written-by-committee nature of the whole thing.
But rehearse the plot we must. Jack plays Will Randall, a menopausal
publishing executive threatened by the predatory manoeuvres of his
youthful sidekick James Spader, who has made a career out of playing
predatory young men in spectacles. Not only this but Will's wife is
giving out the scent that says she's playing away from home. Things
aren't looking good, Will-wise.
Then, of course, he is bitten by a wolf on a lonely country road and
things start changing for the better: full of beans, he gets his act
together at work, puts the prowling Spader in his place and sorts out
his love life, to wit dumping the faithless spouse and hitching up with
Pfeiffer, the beautiful but wild daughter of his boss. Fab.
And then it all starts going wrong again as the facial hair goes
completely out of control and Jack starts waking up with no memory of
having spent the previous night hanging out at the zoo and murdering
innocent civilians on the streets of New York. And then it turns out
that Pfeiffer is a werewolf too and that she's really in love with Jack
and blah blah blah.
Not particularly badly acted or badly directed (honours done by Mike
Nichols, director of The Graduate, Working Girl, and others) Wolf is let
down by the simple fact that there doesn't seem to be much reason for it
to exist in the first place and the protagonists don't go out of their
way to change your mind.
Some have argued that the revival of these Gothic scare stories has
something to do with the fears and aspirations of mid-life set; others,
that we're updating folk myths to incorporate the modern world and the
way we live today. Watch Wolf and you'll think it has something to do
with giving Jack yet another bad-guy-with-a-heart role and very little
else.
At the opposite end of the spectrum is Remains of the Day (cert U)
which goes on to retail release this week. A finer, more human piece of
cinema you could not wish for, even if it does feature rather more of
those ubiquitous luvvies Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson than the
delicate sensibility finds acceptable.
He: devoted butler in thrall to his master, even if he is something of
a rotten old neo-Nazi. She: devoted housekeeper in thrall to devoted
butler even though he is in thrall to Nazi and not in thrall to her.
Not, that is, until many years later when he is old and bitter and she
has married a boarding-house proprietor in Rhyl. Tender, aching and
beautifully observed, Remains remains a must-see.

ALLIED Dunbar, the BAT Industries subsidiary which is the UK's largest
unit-linked life and pensions company, has emerged successfully from
1994, a year which has seen growth in the UK business of major life
insurance giants contract in the face of intense competition and the
problems in the personal pensions market.
Yesterday, for instance, Commercial Union followed the Prudential and
Legal and General in reporting lower UK premium figures for life and
pension products though worldwide there was a useful improvement,
boosted by the acquisition of Groupe Victoire in September.
In the UK, total new annual premium life and pensions business
decreased by 15% to #53.8m.
Allied Dunbar's annualised new business premiums, however, increased
by 2% to #250.2m. Regular premium business also grew by 2% to #161.3m,
counter to the market trend and the company says was a reflection of
Allied's strength in the protection and pensions markets. New sums
assured rose by 15% to #8514.6m.
Single premiums increased by 3% to #888.9m, benefiting from strong
growth in single premium investment business on the back of Allied
Dunbar's Distribution Bond and International Bonds. Total premium income
rose 4% to #1772.7m.
The company's success last year was largely due to growing business
through independent financial advisers where there was a 47% rise in new
business from #28.5m to #41.9m, and which now represents 17% of total
company business.
Allied Dunbar chairman George Greener yesterday commented: ''Our
success in 1994 was based on the quality of our people and our
determination to become market-led throughout the business.''

Music
GNOME-like singer-songwriter Gilles Servat's Brittany is a place given
to lugubrious self-deprecation. We learned that the Breton definition of
a mountain is any hill over 80m high. Similarly, his support slot
eschewed troughs but scaled few memorable peaks.
How unlike Scotland's most under-used natural resource, the
headlining, awe-inspiring Cauld Blast Orchestra. In a laconic plea for
corporate sponsorship, drummer Mike Travis revealed that nine months had
passed since the eight-piece's last gig.
Frankly, this is a national disgrace. In my ideal Scotland, the Cauld
Blast Orchestra would fill Hampden and Murrayfield on a weekly basis.
Not that the CBO's music is archetypally Scottish, despite
encompassing two Rabbie Burns tunes. Indeed, they oft swing with an
enthralling and groove-laden grace which owes as much to the avant-bop
of Roland Kirk as it does to the broad kirk of Celtic folk tradition.
In the CBO's deft hands, chamber music is given a life-saving
transfusion of Gaelic jig-funk. Mournful hill-top vistas become first
rushing streams and then pensive shorelines. There are romantic Romany
interludes; idyllic Bohemian pastorals; crazy bouts of baroque'n'reel; a
heady blurring of the divisions which are mistakenly held to separate
musics and cultures.
All of which, forgive me, sounds the most pretentious bosh -- quite
unlike the Cauld Blast Orchestra, a humorously modest bunch. What was it
tuba-playing pianist Iain Johnstone said at the end of the hepped-up
free-form whirlings of Madman? ''Oozing Celtic, that one.''
Aye, Celtic connections; fantastic connections; electric connections.
When it's the Cauld Blast Orchestra who are making their unique brand of
music, eclectic connections are the best.

THE big film of the week is without question Interview with a Vampire
(18), which lavishly showcases Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood's tiniest
talents -- and I don't mean that in any derogative physical sense -- in
a role he was not born on the fourth of July or any other day of the
month to play. The best film of the week, and many weeks to come, is Ang
Lee's lovely, loving, beautifully crafted and acted story of family
life, Eat Drink Man Woman (PG)
Star power can get films made which otherwise would not have been
made, but it also results in the star being indulged in whatever his or
her particular fantasies are, the most common being that they are actors
who can play many parts when in truth they are but stars who can play
only one part -- themselves. That is the down side.
The studios knew this and showcased their stars with care. Cary Grant
never made a Western, for instance, since he would have looked and
sounded ludicrous in the saddle, just as John Wayne did not make
drawing-room comedies or dally with the cocktail set.
Cruise, a genuine star, is currently top of the heap of his generation
of film actors. Cast him as a brash young all-American jock and he can
deliver the goods as he did in Top Gun, Rain Man, The Firm, or Cocktail.
Cast him as anything else, as anyone who saw Far and Away, his attempt
at a swashbuckling romance set in Oulde Oireland and the Wild West, on
television this week, must recognise, and the result is ludicrous.
He was not born to play Anne Rice's vampire villain, Lestat, and the
fact that in the cast is an actor who, although dark -- Lestat was
blonde, which Cruise deals with by sporting a nicely streaked Veronica
Lake wig -- has all the power and saturnine presence required for the
role makes this even more obvious.
Antonio Banderas, who plays Armand, a Parisian vampire in love with
the film's reluctant vampire hero, Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt),
could have essayed the role perfectly. Cruise, patently uncomfortable in
his eighteenth-century glad rags, might just about get away with playing
Dandini in some fourth-rate production of Cinderella. He has the high
heels for the part, if not the legs.
The photography by Philippe Rousselot is superb, the production values
as high as one would expect from Dante Ferretti, but the continuity is
poor and there are no thrills, fewer chills. Lestat biting the head off
a rat to consume its blood is about as shocking as somebody munching a
raw aubergine. The one memorable moment is after the sacrificial virgin
has been thrown to the ground when the camera rises as the black-cloaked
vampires swoop en masse on to their prey, like ravens descending on the
corpse of a lamb, obliterating her.
The story begins today with Louis, who has a complexion like
Lymeswold, telling his story to an inquisitive author, Christian Slater.
Louis was a widowed plantation owner drinking himself to death on his
plantation outside New Orleans in the late 1790s when he was seduced by
the vampire, Lestat, who introduced him to a world without death spent
in the darkness.
The whole thing is heavily homoerotic -- Lestat adores Louis while
Armand would love to eat him up -- and there is more than a hint of
paedophilia. Lestat and Louis adopt Claudia (Kirsten Dunst, very good),
a little girl orphaned by the plague and turn her into a vampirette.
This is a big mistake since Claudia has the tastes of an adult vampire,
but behaves like a child.
In Rice's book she is only six, and the decision to make her nearer
12, while understandable given what the part requires, is an error.
There is something even nastier in a pubescent child, with an upsetting
resemblance to Mrs Cruise, Nicole Kidman, when crimped and painted,
being the plaything of these two vampire lovers.
Rice's book allegedly takes the reader into another world of the
senses inhabited by vampires, but there is nothing of that in the film,
except for one fleeting moment when the statue of an angel in the
graveyard, where Louis has received his initiation, comes to life and
winks in a most un-angelic manner at the new vampire.
Properly cast and directed -- Jordan shows all the finesse he did with
We're No Angels and High Spirits -- the result could have been a much
darker, far more ambiguous, disturbing, and important film. As it is, it
is just a lot of false teeth, fake blood, and a wee man not so much
waving as drowning.
Another small talent, Jason Donovan, is Mike, a cowman in the
Australian Outback, who befriends a former country and western singer
(Angie Milliken) in Rough Diamonds (PG), directed by Donald Crombie. On
the run from her husband with her teenage daughter, she takes refuge
with Mike who lives with his teenage sister -- they are orphans -- on
the family farm. In hock to the bank, he can only be saved if his prize
bull wins the Brisbane show.
Undemanding, amusing, and endearingly awful it passes the time
agreeably, although Jason as a rough John Wayne type is as convincing as
Tom was playing a bare-knuckle prize-fighter in Far and Away. Jason
does, however, take his shirt off rather well. Better than Tom, at
least. There is one treasurable moment. Sitting on the veranda at dusk
strumming his guitar Jason bursts into song, whereupon Ms Milliken
announces: ''Time I went to bed''. And exits.
Not since Babette held her feast has there been a film to set the
taste buds salivating like Eat Drink Man Woman. Ang Lee directed the
delightful comedy, The Wedding Banquet, and this story of a family
disintegrating and reassembling is a worthy successor.
Mr Chu (Sihung Lung), a widower, Taipei's greatest living chef,
insists on cooking Sunday lunch for his three dissatisfied daughters who
live with him. Jia-Jen, an old maid (Kuei-Mei Yang), is nursing a broken
heart, Jia-Chien (Chien-Lien Wu), a beautiful divorced airline
executive, wants to leave home, and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen-Wang), the
youngest, works in a hamburger joint.
It opens with Chu preparing lunch, a dazzling piece of culinary
acrobatics, although not for the faint-hearted because chickens don't
come with the innards in a plastic bag -- they get their necks wrung and
are cleaned, fish get gutted while still squirming fresh from the pond,
and duck carcasses are blown up like balloons as part of the recipe.
The three girls strive to assert their individuality, to flee the
nest, while Mr Chu, who is losing his sense of taste, is pursued by the
predatory widow who lives across the road. The film is funny in a gentle
way and has a lovely unexpected revelation at the end which, with a
beautiful devised dying fall, which make one leave the cinema feeling
happy and sad but satisfied. It is a gem of a film, a Chinese meal which
satisfies long after being consumed. But if your tastes run to hamburger
then Tom's your boy.

A NICE thick coat is sure to keep you warm -- particularly if it is
wrapped around your water pipes.
It may not be stylish cashmere but the pipe lagging you put on before
the next big freeze will keep you just as cosy -- and may even ensure
that you are saved the misery and expense of frozen pipes.
And insulating hot water pipes will also save you money by preventing
heat disappearing into thin air.
Insulating pipes is an easy DIY job which need not cost a fortune and,
once you have learned a few of the tricks of the trade, can be done very
quickly.
There are two main reasons to use pipe lagging -- to protect cold
pipes from frost and to stop wasteful heat loss from hot pipes.
You must first identify the cold pipes most at risk. They may be under
the ground floor where ventilating air bricks allow a steady flow of
freezing air during the winter.
If you have done a thorough job on insulating the loft space you must
also take the trouble to wrap up the cold pipes up because the roof
space will become much colder.
Outside pipes, in toilets, outhouses and garden taps are also at risk
in winter months.
Hot water pipes constantly lose heat along their entire length.
Sometimes you feel the benefit in a warmer home but often it is simply
burning money.
For example, if your boiler is outside the house in a garage or an
outhouse, the pipe running to the radiators will be pouring out valuable
heat unless it is lagged.
The easiest-to-use insulation material is plastic foam tubing. It
comes in handy lengths and sizes to suit the different sizes of pipes
and is ready split so that it simply slips over the pipework.
Mineral wool or glassfibre pipewrap is also useful when it comes to
tackling exposed pipe fittings.
The most difficult job is often to reach the pipes you wish to lag.
Cold pipes under the floorboards can be hard to locate and tough to lag
along their entire length. If you can lift a floorboard at a suitable
point it is sometimes possible to feed lengths of insulation along the
pipework without having to get down below yourself.

IF she didn't sing for a living, Maura O'Connell has said, she'd be
back selling fish in Ennis, County Clare. Far be it from me to deprive
the family business of a doubtless very effective salesperson. But this
woman was born to sing.
She first came to prominence with De Dannan in the early 1980s before
moving to America's country music capital -- ''Nastyville, Tennis Shoe''
-- where she is still based and where she can draw on great musicians
such as Jerry Douglas, whose dobro guitar picking formed a quarter of
her totally simpatico band.
She opened with Paul Brady's Crazy Dreams and To Be The One, a brace
designed, she said, to shut people up. Designed to knock folks back on
their heels, more like. Initial impacts don't come any stronger, both
songs showing the tremendous clarity of her voice as well as her
formidable dynamic range. Then . . . she just kept getting better.
In a nod towards her traditional roots, she sang Still I Love Him, as
did her fellow ex-De Dannanite, Eleanor Shanley, last week. The two
versions couldn't have been more different: Shanley's straight and true
with just a bodhran accompaniment; O'Connell's true but hammed up
hilariously.
O'Connell doesn't write songs. But she can pick them -- ''they just
have to be brilliant'' -- and make them her own. Her version of Nanci
Griffith's Trouble in the Fields leaves even the original behind. Her
stylistic range is wide open, taking in jazz, torch songs, and
smouldering blues/rock. This was her first concert here; the reception
she got has to mean it won't be her last.

SELECTIVE Assets investment trust suffered a touch of Montezuma's
revenge last year as a plunge in the value of its Latin American
portfolio helped push total assets down 15.6% to #80m.
The net asset fall -- from 204p per share to 165p -- was all the more
noticeable because the previous year's rise had largely been on the back
of stock market increases in emerging markets like Latin America,
particularly Mexico, and Asia.
Pre-tax revenue dropped from #1.4m to #166,000 and, in contrast to the
previous year's #527,000 transfer to revenue reserves, #300,000 was
taken out to help cover the dividend. A total of #1.4m remain.
The top-up funds were certainly needed as group earnings per share
fell to 0.55p from 3.27p, well short of covering the 1.60p dividend paid
by the trust to maintain its progressive dividend policy. The payout is
10% higher than previously.
* ABERFORTH Smaller Companies investment trust has posted a 3.5% drop
in total returns for last year, a performance slightly poorer than its
Hoare Govett benchmark index. The dividend was maintainted at 4.6p for
the year.

THE quality of air that plants need to breathe is a vital issue.
Temperature and moisture levels, while critical, do not cancel out
plants' dislike of cold, tainted or polluted air, writes IAN WALLS.
Take cold air, in the form of a draft, for example. It can be deadly.
I am shocked to see how some shopkeepers gaily put out tender plants at
their shop front doors, irrespective of any outside temperature.
Even hardy plants dislike drafts. This is why conifers go brown along
one side. Very warm air can be just as damaging, or more so. Plants can
literally shrivel up, if kept near a hot water radiator.
Moisture-laden air can be fine for plants such as ferns, or commercial
cucumber crops. Over-moist air, however, can create problems for house
plants, especially when temperatures are low. It can encourage grey
mould.
Outdoor plants can react violently to carbon monoxide fumes, given off
by petrol and diesel vehicles. This is why plants in central
reservations often have a rough time. Salt-laden air at the seaside can
also be damaging.
As far as dirt in the atmosphere is concerned, we have come a long way
over the years. Yet, for rapid growth, one of the most important
elements in air is carbon dioxide. Plants need this, to be absorbed by
their leaves in manufacturing carbo-hydrates.
Research many years ago indicated that the atmosphere in a greenhouse
could be enriched by extra carbon dioxide, to encourage growth. The
weight of crops produced could also be improved.
For this reason, most commercial tomato growers enrich the greenhouse
air with carbon dioxide. Gardeners using paraffin stoves inadvertently
enrich the atmosphere with carbon dioxide gas. Unfortunately, there can
also be a lot of condensation too. If the stove is not operating
correctly, there can even be sulphur fumes.
It all goes to show that you can't take clean air for granted.

GIBSON Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company which specialises
in design and contract work for Chinese power stations, is locked in a
potentially grave financing dispute with its partners in a multi-million
pound project.
Though no direct confirmation was available from the company's St
Vincent Place headquarters, an executive acknowledged that serious
renegotiations with its consortium partners have been under way for the
past month.
''It is a very complex issue concerning a big contract in China,
though that is all I am prepared to say at the moment,'' deputy managing
director Hugh O'Donnell said yesterday.
But he strenuously denied reports in Scottish engineering circles that
the company -- best known as Gibson Wells -- could face major problems
if the issue was not resolved in its favour. ''We are certain this is
not the case,'' he said.
The consortium, contracted to build a coal-fired power station in
southern China, is believed to include Babcock and ABB, a Swiss concern.
Babcock is thought to be vying for the lead contractor position, in
competition with Gibson.
Tom Gibson, managing director and founder of the company, was not
available for comment. A China trade veteran of two decades, he was
awarded an MBE for his services to industry last year.
His company's plush city-centre offices were officially opened
recently by Sir Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister and China
specialist whose Beijing contacts were a help Gibson.
Ironically, the company has just been been forced by the high lease
cost of the location to withdraw from part of the St Vincent Place
premises. Its 34 employees are now based in number 19, the neighbouring
site having been vacated.

Picture: EDWARD JONES
FOR Peter Aitken of Broomhill Nursery at Kirkintilloch, tending
diminutive bonsai specimens is a far cry from the acres of tomatoes and
lettuce he once grew in his massive glasshouses but every bit as
demanding.
When I called in to see him, he told me of the care and dedication
involved in the art of bonsai, whether growing them from seed, cuttings
or young plants which he buys in from specialist producers.
Peter is very proud of a 200-year-old juniper which he has in stock.
The bonsai can be accurately dated from estate records as it was saved
from an old hedge ripped out from the New Forest.

ONE of the depressing things about the repeated rounds of spending
cuts in the British public sector -- apart from their mysterious failure
actually to reduce the amount of money spent -- has been the sheer
stupidity of some of the false economies inflicted on us. Lack of
investment in public transport, skimping on library costs, cheapskate
pay for teachers, penny-pinching at the magnificently cheap and
effective BBC World Service; all will probably go down in history as
prime examples of the short-sighted
parsimony that contributed to Britain's long-term economic and social
decline.
And now, in a particularly glaring instance of the same mindless
passion for cost-cutting, it seems that James Boyle, the Head of Radio
Scotland, has no sooner shaped up his network to win the UK National
Station of the Year Award, than he is told, once again, that he must
find ''savings across the board''; worse, that one of the departments
faced with the deepest cuts is Boyle's own baby, the Radio Scotland
Education Department which he once ran. This week, the department
launched its latest historical drama A Parcel of Rogues, a modestly
produced but powerful five-part serial written by the poet/playwright
Alan Spence, designed to act as background for students in the 10-14 age
group studying the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715. But it seems likely that
this will be the last full drama for schools produced by Radio Scotland;
dramatisation may be the most effective way of introducing children to
history, but it is also the most expensive and the most vulnerable to
the axe.
Of course, it's easy to understand, from the point of view of Radio
Scotland as a whole, how education emerges as an obvious target for
cuts. Schools Radio has never been a very ''sexy'' field, spoken-word
radio is not a strong influence in modern children's lives, and the
costs are no doubt high in relation to listening figures, despite the
effort that now goes into finding publishers and software companies who
will share the costs of producing ancilliary teaching material. But
those who do use this material in schools are not so much enthusiastic
as ecstatic about its value and potential; and many are deeply concerned
about the loss of Scottish perspectives in history and other subjects --
the growing and inevitable temptation to use material produced primarily
for the larger English market -- that comes with the erosion of
Scotland's capacity to produce its own educational material, in radio as
elsewhere.
So is it beyond the wit of the Scottish polity, as a whole to come up
with the odd #50,000 in question? Is there no Scottish Office quango
that could lose a couple of well-paid members in this cause? Might the
Government permit local authorities to contribute a few quid? Or have
the powers that be, in St Andrew's
House and elsewhere, actually been listening to A Parcel of Rogues,
which, as a starting point for discussion, presents the Jacobite and
anti-Union side of the old Scottish argument with a vigour which even
late twentieth-century representatives of the British state in Scotland
might find a shade discomfiting? Perish the thought of course, that
Scottish schoolchildren in the 1990s might be allowed to hear only one,
official, London-orientated version of British history.
Meanwhile admirers of Radio Scotland's educational programmes might
also be interested in a vivid little series of profiles of Scottish
writers, originally produced by Bruce Young for Sixth Year Studies
pupils, now being repeated for general listeners on Wednesday evenings.
So far, the series -- in which I should declare a small interest, since
I was one of the contributors to a later programme on Liz Lochhead --
has included a powerful short feature on Muriel Spark, based on her
relationship with Edinburgh and presented by Alan Taylor, and a slightly
less effective piece on James Hogg, which, unlike the delightfully crisp
and waspish Spark programme, could not be built around the author's own
voice, and did not hit its stride until the assembled critics and
commentators began to get to grips with Hogg's staggering and
mind-bending masterpiece, the Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified
Sinner. But taken as a whole the series represents a vibrant and useful
little library of information and ideas about nineteenth and
twentieth-century Scottish writing, a perfect example of how good
educational publishing supports and enriches our whole culture; long may
it continue by hook, crook, or sheer political will.

AS far as I'm concerned the television event of the week was Doris Day
on yesterday's Pebble Mill (BBC1), despite the fact I didn't have time
to watch her. (Friday noon always finds me hirpling down the straight,
gasping painfully, towards the deadline of this column.)
When I was eight I fell in love with Calamity Jane, the
Thelma-and-Louise of Deadwood City, and by association with Doris Day.
She remained an icon for the next few years until my hormones started
pointing me in the direction of Bobby Vee. But a fondness remained, even
while she was playing hard-to-get career women in wholesome comedies,
and it slowly dawned that Doris was saying something about women and
independence.
She was the best role model for feminism which post-war, pre-seventies
Hollywood produced. What were her much-mocked screen virginity and
80-minute resistance to the strategies of suitors but the early
intimations of cultural change? Here was a woman redefining herself,
rejecting the honeytrap of romance for the bracing spaces beyond the
school run. True, her go-it-alone ambition always went spectacularly in
the last reel but -- sigh -- hasn't that been the fate of many of the
seventies sisterhood? There's nothing in the handbook which says you
shouldn't sleep with the enemy.
The enemy? Only the flintiest feminist would open hostilities with
someone like Neil Simon, whose plays have always understood the absurd
pickle of negotiation which men and women bring to their mating, and
don't take sides. America's most successful modern playwright was the
tour guide in Sunday's edition of God Bless America, Granada's elite
programme of citybreaks -- a series which makes you eat your heart out
for the simple genius of the idea, and the opportunity to execute it.
Here we have the confluence of two irresistible cultural forces:
well-known American writers and their well-known native cities, united
in a profile of both.
What good luck that Scott Turow, who writes classy legal thrillers
like Presumed Innocent, was born in Chicago (the first programme); Neil
Simon was born in New York and Gore Vidal was born in Washington
(tomorrow's programme). I'm sure a gifted programme-maker could make
something special of re-uniting Toni Morrison with her home town of
Lorain, Ohio, but would we find the results so available? Cities have a
particular hold on our imagination, and American cities have engraved
their skylines on the global consciousness like no others. Urban America
is another country, but we've all been there in our minds.
Neil Simon's gentle, ambulatory monologue on New York was elegiac. He
described an irretrievable city; the New York where you could run
barefoot through Washington Square Park at two in the morning (you'd
lacerate your feet on used needles today) and mothers still pushed
babies along Mott Street and Broadway's theatres staged plays instead of
''events'' like The Phantom of the Opera. But Simon, the nicest of men,
showed no bitterness for his lost playground and continued to celebrate
all that has endured, served by photography which, like the Manhattan
skyline, improved upon nature. Is there any ''event'' to compete with
the sunset view from the Staten Island ferry?
Cities are the wonders of the world -- fabulous beyond the artifices
of nature. They are the crucible of the best and the worst in the human
condition, and the most complex single achievement of social
co-operation. I've just caught up with BBC2's series Metropolis, a short
illustrated history of urban technology, and I started at the bottom: in
the cesspits and open sewers of London, in a midden of scatalogical
memorabilia which included Lord Mayor Whittington's mass public latrine
(two long rows of seats accommodating 64 men and 64 women over a gully
leading into the Thames) and the Cloak and Bucket Man who, for a fee,
brought relief in the streets.
The Victorians, naturally, sorted things out -- but not until cholera
was endemic in London, the underground Fleet River exploded from the
build-up of raw sewage gases and the Thames was so badly polluted that
the hot summer of 1858 became known as the Year of the Big Stink. But
even their wonderfully engineered sewers and the later development of
sewage treatment plants have only put the problem of waste disposal on
hold.
The villain in the story is the hero of our domestic lives -- the
water-closet down which we now flush much more than human waste. The
miracle of the flush toilet has caused more problems than it's solved,
namely, huge amounts of polluted water. But I have every faith in human
ingeniousness which, sooner rather than later, will be asked to find
some other method of going to the loo.
Look at any tour operator's brochure and you'll see that with a few
exceptions -- Reykjavik, perhaps, or Brussels -- it's the glamour cities
which get the breaks. But every city is a chapter in the human story,
and if life were longer I'd even go back to Brussels. The travel
industry is too inclined to define the appeal of destinations in
check-lists of ''sights'', but this week Channel 4's admirable Travelog
again showed itself ahead of all the other television travel guides.
Streets ahead, in fact; in the streets of Casablanca -- which is merely
the fourth largest metropolis on the African continent -- Pete McCarthy
redeemed the reputation of a city neglected by tourists and reviled by
guide books for not being the Casablanca of Bogart and Bergman. Next
week, more unfashionable cities: Belfast and Beirut.
What is a cruise liner but a small, itinerant city, required to
service its population through complex technologies of catering, waste
disposal, communications, transport, and entertainment? What the
landlocked city doesn't have, however, is an Entertainment Officer,
posted at its gateways to welcome new citizens and commissioned to keep
them happy. But for all the hearty, fixed-rictus hopelessness of this
job, The Ship's Entertainment Officer (the third part of BBC2's
documentary series Situation Vacant) brought a daft smile of pleasure to
my face. Anything concerning Canberra can do no wrong by me.
Canberra. You don't call her ''The Canberra'', which was the first
mistake one of the aspiring officers made, you call it ''Canberra'', as
if she were indeed the city which gave the ship her name. Two family
holidays on this doyenne of British cruise liners (her character changes
during the school holidays, and so do the duties of the entertainment
officers, who become people to whom parents become tearfully grateful)
gave me the confidence to pick the successful candidate from the four
hopefuls on their trial cruise. I was wrong. And then suddenly I was
right: ''Kenneth was unemployed for several months, and then became an
Entertainment Officer on Canberra. He is now on her world cruise.''
I'm holding fire on Signs and Wonders (BBC2), the new serial drama by
Michael Eaton. The first episode looked overcrowded with belief systems
as well as storylines, and it's hard to care about Claire (Jodhi May),
the daughter lost to a Los Angeles cult, when we have no impression of
her personality before she was snared by the love hook. But there are
some strong performers around (James Earl Jones, David Warner, Donald
Pleasance) and enough tension to make me keep watching; whereas I gave
up on BBC1's self-indulgent Tears before Bedtime after the first
episode.

Labour MPs whose constituencies involve any manufacturing association

the decision cast a shadow over all of the firm's employees. The
company's European partners will also be targeted.
Shop stewards at the plant have not ruled out strike action. However,
they were adamant yesterday that the first stage of the campaign should
involve trying to convince company chiefs and the firm's European
partners that the decision should be reversed.
The plea to support the campaign came the day after management
confirmed it is to close its highly regarded engineering research and
design centre in East Kilbride and transfer work to Bristol and Derby.
The company claimed it needed to cut costs to compete in the ruthless
aero engine market and announced that 500 highly skilled engineers and
designers and 100 shopfloor and storeworkers would be paid off.
The rundown is expected to begin in May and be completed by the end of
the year, leaving 1000 jobs at the East Kilbride plant.
The decision has been described by one union leader as ''a collective
tragedy for East Kilbride, Scotland, and also British manufacturing
industry''.
Local Labour MP Adam Ingram said after a 90-minute meeting with shop
stewards yesterday that about 50 Labour MPs with a Rolls-Royce plant or
supplier factory in their constituency would be asked to join the
campaign. A meeting has been arranged in the House of Commons for
February 2.
Mr Ingram said: ''There is a clear common interest. After this
decision, Rolls-Royce workers everywhere, whether it be Hillington,
other parts of the East Kilbride operation, or anywhere else in the UK
cannot feel safe.''
Mr Graham Irvine, senior shop steward for manual workers at the plant,
said industrial action was not on the agenda at present. He believed the
case was strong enough without the threat of a strike.
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions, mainly
representing Manufacturing, Science, Finance, and other technical white
collar workers, said union officials left the meeting with Mr Ingram
''feeling more positive than we did this time yesterday''.
Mr Thomas added: ''We are sure the company's partners in Europe must
be looking at this move with growing trepidation and must be wondering
what is going on.''
Mr Brian Bonnar, chairman of East Kilbride Business Forum, said he
shared the concerns of the community but he understood that the decision
had been taken after long and hard consideration.
He added: ''The statement from Rolls-Royce that the future of the
repairs and overhaul division is assured is welcomed by the forum.''

IN April, 1993, Robert Fryers slipped out of Northern Ireland and set
up base in Neasden, London. He was quickly tracked by the Metropolitan
Police anti-terrorist branch, SO13, and, to use their terminology,
''placed under control''.
He was soon seen associating with IRA sympathisers and, most
importantly, it is believed he recruited new members for the cause. With
his bulk he could hardly hide, so as the surveillance teams tracked his
comings and goings, their counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland
were kept briefed. Fryers returned to Belfast at the end of May to
report to his superiors and one month later he appeared in Sauchie.
The security forces are aware how the Sauchie connection came about
from information provided by the security operation which surrounded
Fryers. Everything was put in place as they waited for Fryers to make
his move.
It is clear the operation had switched squarely to the Loch Brae
house, one of a long block of council flats round a small square. It is
also clear that over the subsequent months a number of Irishmen were
coming and going to the Sauchie house, some of them known players. It
was apparent that Clackmannanshire was considered a safe area by the
Provisional IRA.
The current train of events started with the funeral of Hugh Jack's
mother on March 27, 1993, when the secret observation revealed that
Fryers was present in Sauchie. A number of other known players were also
identified among the mourners at the graveside.
Neighbours at the block of flats did not appear to have noticed
anything amiss -- in an area where Irish associations, albeit more
usually on the other side of the sectarian divide, were not unusual, the
presence of Irish accents would most likely be taken as belonging to
relatives of Mrs Jack. With hindsight, it is possible to say that Fryers
used this visit as a reconnaissance, checking that Sauchie was a
suitable base for a major operation.
In the second week in May, Fryers stayed in Sauchie at Jack's house,
living with him for about two weeks -- something he had done on several
occasions.
Fryers went to Ireland for two weeks, returning on June 27 to Jack's
house by a secret route. The appearance of normality was maintained by
Fryers and Jack. They drank at Jack's local, the Mansefield Arms, and
Fryers even took part in the karaoke night. They had the excellent cover
of the Jack's Irish family background and they had grown in confidence.
The pub owner, Mr John Gibson, 45, recalls that Fryers was accepted
locally as an Irish relative of the Jack family. Locals say the shots
were being called by another leading terrorist, Gerry Mackin, 33, who
was jailed for 25 years in October last year for causing 10 explosions
in London. When Fryers or Jack became too boisterous, one word from
Mackin was enough to silence them.
The June visit was different from the others, however. It became
obvious that Fryers had previously been on rest and recreation. In late
June, he was lying low and there was a new urgency in his movements. The
two men travelled to Bridge of Allan, 25 miles away, to make telephone
calls from call boxes. In Fryer's case, he began acting like a PIRA man,
doubling back to make sure he was not being followed and taking
precautions.
He visited Edinburgh and Glasgow, buying rubber gloves in one shop,
Duracell batteries, pliers, tape, and heat resistant terminals (small
crocodile clips) in another. Fryers and Jack also visited business parks
in Central and Strathclyde regions, showing a particular interest in one
in Glasgow -- a row of units for small businesses owned by Spectrum
Properties (Scotland) in Cotton Street, Dalmarnock.
Mr Bill Roddie, the owner, was questioned by detectives who
painstakingly searched his skip for receipts. Jack had paid a #200
rental advance to Mr Roddie for one small unit after seeing his
advertisment in a newspaper. He used a false name.
''He came here on a Saturday afternoon and returned later with the
money. He was supposed to come back for keys. We never heard anything
further until the police arrived in force,'' said Mr Roddie.
Around this time, the pair were also visiting car auctions, looking
for vehicles. The police and security services by now had every reason
to believe that the plan was crystallising -- that Fryers intended
taking delivery of a very large quantity of home made explosive, the
deadly mixture of fertiliser and sugar which the PIRA use to such
effect, and using the rented premises in Glasgow to make major car bombs
destined for English cities.
As the surveillance continued, a new chapter began, leading directly
to the unravelling of this ambitious plan.
On July 5, Fryers travelled by train to London -- still being tailed.
He went to a car park and collected a Ford Escort left there for him. He
drove north to Sauchie that Sunday night and took the car to a lock-up
garage close to Jack's home which Jack had rented.
The two men worked on the car in the lock-up and then, on the night of
Tuesday, July 13, Fryers drove away from Sauchie and headed south. The
idea had formed among the security men and police that Fryers was
stepping out of line, that he intended making a political gesture by
challenging the ''ring of steel'' around Central London. He was acting
the maverick, aiming for the single-handed propaganda coup.
He was, in security service terms, still ''controlled'' and, when
officers moved in to arrest him in Crest Road, Cricklewood, the blue
Escort contained a bomb. Fryers said: ''It is not primed'', and then,
the trained PIRA operative in action, uttered not one word more other
than to ask for a lawyer.
Simultaneously, back in Scotland, a number of people were detained
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Jack was the first target and
five others followed. Nine houses in all were raided simultaneously by
armed officers. The subjects were transported independently to the
secure police station at Maryhill and detained in isolation from each
other -- a vital part of such an operation. One officer involved
described the concerted raids and movements as ''like air traffic
control''.
There was one serious hitch, however, which brought the vast and
delicately poised operation close to the realms of total cock-up.
Fryers's arrest in London took place at 9.30am. Jack, following his
usual routine, arrived home from the turkey farm at noon to make his
lunch.
In the meantime, news of the Fryers's arrest had been leaked from
Scotland Yard to a television reporter. As Jack watched the lunchtime
news, he learned of the arrest of his accomplice. It was also broadcast
on radio.
Jack always left home at 1pm to return to work. The arrest team were
not completely in place, however, when Jack fled the house prematurely,
leaped into his C registration Nissan Sunny, and headed towards the
farm. He was carrying a black holdall when, with the police and security
services in pursuit, he turned into the farm road which runs through a
forestry plantation.
Jack turned off the main track and for a short period was lost from
sight by the pursuers. Soon afterwards, he was caught at the farm where
police armed with Heckler and Koch carbines held workers at gunpoint
until Jack was identified and taken away. He was not in possession of
the holdall and it was not in the silver Sunny.
The police faced a serious problem. Jack had been missing for five or
six minutes. The farm had a large cess pit into which the bag might have
been dumped and the surrounding forest was heavily undergrown.
A detailed search was started the following morning, Thursday, and
continued the following day, hampered by heavy rain. The holdall was
found in a separate copse, half buried, only 500 yards beyond the
outskirts of the next village, Coalsnaughton, on the following Saturday.
It was familiar territory for Jack, right behind the dump where the
foul-smelling waste of the turkey farm was deposited.
The holdall contained six of everything -- six 2.5kg blocks of Semtex,
six TPU fuses, six detonators, plus one Duracell battery, and one linen
glove as well as 9mm ammunition. Jack was not armed.
The device which Fryers had in his car in London had been made from
the same batch of Semtex. The quantities were the same and the tape was
the same. Fryers's device was undoubtedly ''made in Sauchie''.
Jack's flight in panic was his undoing. If he had followed his usual
routine, he might have been able to go to a jury with the excuse that he
had been housing Fryers out of friendship and that he was unaware of the
bomb-making materials in his home. That could have made the case against
him substantially harder to prove.

IT'S a sad fact of life that most of our talented young product
designers are forced abroad to seek work. British culture, with its
aversion to risk, simply fails to attract and develop entrepreneurs who
could create a fertile manufacturing base in which new and innovative
design can flourish.
Thankfully, there is one exception to this dearth of design
facilities. Glasgow School of Art's highly regarded Product Design
Department is the only establishment, certainly outside Italy, whose
students are annually offered two industrial placements -- and #1000
each -- for six weeks at Cassina's research and development centre at
Meda, outside Milan.
The 1995 Cassina Prize has been won by Jon Stevenson of Paisley. He
translated the brief for ''a set of furniture for a young, single man''
into three pieces of multi-functional bed-sitting-office furniture which
seamlessly joins the diverse needs of the age of technology and contract
culture.
''The idea,'' explained Jon, ''was the man could sustain himself
within this one environment, each piece of furniture has several
functions.''
This year, Professor Filippo Alison, Professor of Design at Naples
University, and International Designer and Consultant to Cassina, has
awarded Cassina Prizes to James Jefferson from Bedford and Sandy
Henderson from Coupar Angus. The pair will go to Milan in late summer.
This year's project was to design a shelving unit or storage
presentation unit for displaying a specific collection. James's design,
aimed with a director's executive office in mind, was inspired by cities
. . . dominating skyscrapers, smaller buildings, growth, hierarchy. Some
pieces will be on open view, others, more private or requiring greater
security, will be intriguingly half-hidden, or viewed through distorting
peepholes of the kind fitted to front doors and lit from within.
Sandy Henderson's decision that if two-dimensional pieces of art can
be put in frames on walls, why should three-dimensional pieces not enjoy
the same treatment, clearly appealed to the judges.
His quite unconventional, variously sized 3-D frames can be distorted
to individual taste to display their valuables -- antique snuff boxes?
he suggests -- on their perforated steel backplates to which they are
attached by magnets. The perforated backing allows the object to be
uplit from underneath.
' The idea was the man could sustain himself within this one
environment '

HISTORY was made yesterday when 18-year-old Andrew Wilson, of
Renfrewshire, was sworn in as a Canadian citizen by Canada's new High
Commissioner to Britain, the Hon Royce Frith.
It is the first time a High Commissioner has sworn in a Canadian
citizen in Scotland in living memory.
Andrew's sister, Lindsay, 15, also received her citizenship at the
ceremony in Edinburgh, although she did not have to swear the oath as
she is under 18.
However, the question on everyone's lips was: who is Andrew going to
support when Scotland's rugby squad meet Canada at Murrayfield today?
''That's a difficult one,'' he said. ''I'm going to hope for a draw.''
Andrew's mother, Mrs Lorraine Wilson, was born in Saskatchewan, West
Canada, the daughter of a ''Canadian soldier and Scottish war bride''.
She moved to Scotland in 1949.
She and Andrew's father, Mr David Wilson, decided to give their
children the opportunity of settling in two countries, as well as
satisfying a sentimental bond Mrs Wilson has for her birthplace.
The High Commissioner, who is on his first official visit to Scotland,
will watch today's match at Murrayfield in the company of Princess Anne.

MADE in Sauchie was the trademark on the bombs which would have
devastated six English city centres last year had a truly frightening
IRA plot succeeded.
The master bomb maker, 43-year-old Robert Fryers, a 23-stone
Ulsterman, was manufacturing the Semtex triggers in the house at 25 Loch
Brae, Sauchie, a quiet backwater in a former mining village which is
itself a quiet backwater, to detonate massive home-made car bombs
capable of enormous destruction.
Sauchie was the home of his key accomplice -- Hugh Thomas Jack, 36,
the youngest of a large, well-known family in the Clackmannanshire
village. In the terminology of the security services, Fryers was a known
player. For years, he had been under surveillance, always evading
detection and arrest. Jack was the unknown quantity, the new-style IRA
recruit, and his home village the unlikely setting for an IRA safe base.
Jack was recruited through a relative and introduced to Fryers.
The case of Jack illustrated the bottom line of modern Provisional IRA
philosophy which sees the religious divide in Northern Ireland as
nothing more than a convenient excuse. The reality is that they recruit
by ideology rather than by religion.
Hugh Jack -- Shug or Tommy to all and sundry in Sauchie -- was a black
sheep, a nuisance to the local community, to his relatives, and to the
police. His father, who died in his 70s in March last year, was a local
man and a Protestant in what is a strongly Protestant area with an
Orange tradition.
Mrs Jack came from Donegal, arriving first in Scotland, as so many
decent Irish people did, as an agricultural worker. Now also dead, she
was a Catholic -- yet some of the children, including Hugh, attended a
local Protestant school and then went on to Lornshill Academy, Alloa, a
non-denominational school.
Others went to Catholic schools. For a period when the children were
young, the family moved briefly to Bradford as Mr Jack tried,
unsuccessfully, to find work. Their neighbours in Sauchie thought the
world of Mr and Mrs Jack.
A local teacher, Mr John Gallacher, said it was a blessing she did not
live to see her family shamed. ''She was a charming, friendly, and very
loving mother,'' he said.
The other Jack family members are scattered -- elder sister Frances in
Alloa, Robert in Sauchie, James, the eldest, in Alloa, and Allan in
north London.
After the death of their parents, Frances took on the mothering role
and moved into the parental house at Park Crescent, Sauchie. Allan moved
to London in 1982, living in the Irish community and working for Thames
Water Board. He had adopted his mother's Catholicism and had become a
die-hard Celtic fan. Prior to the case involving his younger brother,
Allan Jack had been held and questioned by the security services and
police on a number of occasions.
Hugh Jack, however, became something of a local waster, a
ne'er-do-well who ran up a string of minor convictions for breach of the
peace and assault, including assault on the woman to whom he was briefly
married.
From the age of 16, he had been committing small offences. His
marriage broke up in 1990. He was known as a drunken, foul-mouthed,
dirty, and violent man, in his youth an ardent Rangers supporter. By
associating with Fryers, he jumped from the third division into the
premier league.
By 1988, Hugh Jack had found some form of reasonably regular
employment, starting first as a casual worker at the local Gartmorn
turkey farm and, when not there, buying scrap cars and rebuilding them
for sale. His employer at Gartmorn, Mr Roger Lucy, recalls Jack as a
volatile hard man with a brutal streak.
''He had this reputation for getting back up again in a fight,'' said
Mr Lucy. ''If you needed a hard job done, such as smashing up concrete,
Tommy was your man. He would go at it with a hammer, no gloves, and his
hands skinned, until the job was done. He had a wild look in his eye
which somehow people respected.
''At the same time, he liked to feel important and I think that the
idea of being associated with the IRA would give him that feeling. He
was a good worker, very thorough, and he could be trusted to do a task
-- but when he had a drink you kept well away from him.''
Locals recall Jack as never having two pennies to rub together but,
when he did, it went on drink. However, with no visible means of
support, he suddenly sobered up, began wearing new and expensive
clothes, and changed his car.
People thought he had been stealing. The fact that he had enough
Semtex stored in his council flat to devastate the entire village is not
being forgotten or forgiven.
A neighbour told The Herald: ''He put all our lives at risk. He had no
political leanings. It must have been for money.''

A MAN being hunted by police after his former wife was shot dead on
Christmas Day was arrested yesterday after a fight between two men in
Old Street, London, police said.
The arrest of Mr Phillip Manning, 42, came as the funeral of his
former wife, Mrs Margaret Whitcombe, took place near her home at
Abertillery, Gwent.
Mrs Whitcombe, 42, was shot with a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun
in the hallway of her home in George Barker Avenue. Her boyfriend, Mr
Neil Jones, also 42, was stabbed in the head with what was believed to
be a 12-inch knife.

AUTUMN Bliss is well established as a raspberry variety for late
season production.
It is now being rivalled by a new variety called Dinkum. This produces
well formed, firm fruit of high quality and flavour. It is apparently
easier to pick than Autumn Bliss.
A lot depends on the type of autumn we get, whether raspberries ripen
successfully or not but growing some autumn produce is an interesting
way of extending the fresh fruit season.
* IF you haven't pruned your apples and pears, now is a good time to
do so. It is a question of thinning out and shaping, rather than giving
a vigorous pruning.

THE HCI hospital debacle has provided some estate agents with a wee
tonic. Last year saw dozens of highly paid medical staff fly into
Scotland looking to buy or rent good quality properties. Now that many
of them are haveing to leave sooner than they had planned, the agents
are picking up the opportunity of disposing of the properties.
No.2 Lancaster Crescent, a ground floor and basement conversion in
Glasgow's West End, must be one of the finest. Formed on the ground
floor of an elegant terrace it was built around 1898 in sandstone.
It was purchased by a couple of HCI staff who were very impressed by
Glasgow's architecture and wanted to recreate the atmosphere of graceful
townhouse life. When they bought it, the property was in fairly good
condition but had lost some of its previous charm.
They decided to invest in a whoslesale improvement scheme, bringing
new cornicing and other feature into rather neglected back rooms. The
result is a house which has been designed for entertaining, its three
linked public rooms guaranteed to have maximum impact on guests.
The dining hall is totally woodlined and has the atmosphere of a Scots
baronial castle, in contrast to the light, airy feel of the adjoining
library and sitting room. There is a listed leaded glass window spanning
the large communal stairway.
The focal point of the dining hall is a dramatic stone fireplace with
carved detail in the upper section, a deep hearth and living flame gas
log fire. Its original panelling extends to the height of the doorways
and there is also a stained/leaded glass window on one side. The detail
and condition of the panelling is excellent with carvings above doors.
It has a varnished hardwood original flooring.
The drawing room has a bay window to front with an outlook to
Lancaster Crescent, the communal front garden areas and also over to
adjacent properties in Lancaster Terrace and Alexander Thomson's Great
Western Terrace. A second focal point of the room is the high fireplace
which has inset marble to the front and a living flame coal effect gas
fire in basket.
The drawing room also has panelling to dado height. Its bold and
detailed plasterwork ceiling is currently complemented by an impressive
chandeli er which would be available to any interested buyer, by
separate negotiation.
Sliding doors give access to the library which also has bay windows to
the front. The room has a great deal of wood panelling and varnished
wood finishes.
The built-in book cases are original and adjoin the fireplace which
has marble in its lower section, an ornate mantelpiece and then it
continues almost to ceiling height. With its detail panels and carvings,
the current owners believe that the fireplace is of Dutch origin.
The main bedroom has a very traditional feel to it and has a five
paned window which is split into 15 main sections, wooden wall panelling
with particularly ornate frieze scenes and various inscriptions, and an
unusual fireplace with panelling to either side. There is also a
charming ''secret'' door through to the drawing room.
The kitchen has been completely refitted with a hand-built pine
kitchen designed to make the best use of space, by Mark Wilkinson
Furniture. Downstairs are two storage rooms, one of which is currently
used as a study and the other as a dressing room.
With only two bedrooms, the house has been converted to make maximum
use of the public rooms and is probably not ideal for a family
purchaser. Offers over #250,000 are being sought by Slater Hogg &amp;
Howison.

SINCE his last Scottish appearance, Dmitri Hvorostovsky's voice seems
to have darkened and deepened, his personality to have lost its
boyishness. But then, with programmes such as last night's, in which
perhaps the happiest moment was provided by the dreamy wistfulness of
Tchaikovsky's At the Ball, there was little scope for lightness of
touch.
Undoubtedly None but the Lonely Heart, which opened the recital, set
the tone of the evening. Exploring shade after shade of melancholy, he
occasionally permitted himself a flash of the sardonic, as in Don Juan's
Serenade (Tchaikovsky version), or of rapturous impulse, as in
Rachmaninov's Spring Waters. But mostly it was a world of grim nights,
of torment and farewell, that preoccupied him and his like-minded
accompanist Mikhail Arkadiev who, even with the piano lid lowered,
proved a powerful master of mood.
Songs by Mussorgsky or Shostakovich could have continued the vein, but
Hvorostovsky turned instead to a song cycle by a little-known
octogenarian, Georgii Sviridov, and made it sound like the logical
climax of the evening. Entitled Russia Cast Adrift, these 12 settings of
poems by Sergei Yesenin were a sort of Winterreise of the Steppes, shot
through with scriptural overtones, grand landscapes, moments of
shimmering brilliance amid the darkness.
Declaiming them with great statuesque gestures, he made the most of
their strong ballad-like rhythms, bringing a huge driving force to the
final song, finely matched by Arkadiev's burning, pounding
accompaniment.

ROBERT Fryers addressed the judge from the dock before sentence was
passed. His statement was the first he had spoken since his bus stop
arrest, apart from saying that he had a device in his possession and it
was not, at that stage, a danger to anyone. His statement in full was:
''I made a plea of not guilty, because I am not guilty of a criminal
offence.
''When I came to this country, I believed that what I was doing was
right, and I still believe that.
''Ireland has been under British occupation for the last 800 years and
the Irish people have consistently fought that occupation. The British
Government and the judiciary responded by putting to death and
imprisonment many Irish people. It has never worked.
''The sentence you will give me today and the sentences that have been
given to many republicans before me, have never changed the political
situation in my country.
''Hopefully, now that the peace process has begun in Ireland and that
the IRA have called a complete cessation of military operations to help
move the peace process forward, this will be one of the last republican
cases to come before an English court.
''I hope that the peace process does work, and that all the people of
Ireland will be able to live together in a country that has a just and
lasting peace free from British interference.''

NOW listen up. Tonight at the Tramway there is a show that apparently
has not sold well at all. Last night it was in Edinburgh at the Festival
Theatre and if you are in the remotest fashion a groover (like what we
are on The Herald) you will get yourself there.
This is modern classical music with a difference. Not so much with a
beat as with a thump. Steve Martland's music is loud, with a dirty,
sax-drenched sound and a pulse that doesn't so much drive as pound.
This show features tracks off his latest album, including two extracts
from the brilliant Danceworks (keep your feet still if you can) and
Principia, which is a bit like martial arts set to music. Martland
introduces and conducts the programme (and throws in a free polemic
about creeping privatisation in education).
Sheer entertainment too from the band, joined by the Smith Quartet in
a lush and opulent version of Martland's wonderful song Fantasy Island,
and in a lunatic encore where the whole outfit went ballistic in a
raging version of Madness's Baggy Trousers.
The first half displays the Smith Quartet in an intense and
beautifully sustained version of Martland's Patrol, the work in which
the composer displays a surprisingly lyrical turn of phrase. Brilliant
show. Tramway. Tonight. Be there.

JACK'S house in Loch Brae and the former family home at 45 Park
Crescent, owned by his brother Allan, were literally taken apart as
forensic scientists used the proverbial fine-tooth comb.
A vast amount of highly important intelligence was gathered, including
fingerprints of other known players and others, as then unknown, which
could be compared with those held by the security services. All the hard
evidence pointed to six major car bombs, detonated by Fryers's Semtex
devices, aimed at six city centres in England.
The surveillance operation began from security service intelligence
and, while the Metropolitan Police SO13 branch played the major part,
equally vital were the Scottish police forces -- particularly the
country's second smallest force, Central Scotland.
Enormous credit accrues to them. The security service and the
Metropolitan Police will receive the plaudits in the English media,
which may be fair to an extent since the commander in charge of the
anti-terrorist branch has a national responsibility. In terms of any
crime in central Scotland, the responsibility, however, falls on Chief
Constable William Wilson.
It was his senior team who did the planning. At the sharp end, a large
corps of Special Branch officers from Strathclyde Police -- men and
women who have worked over the years to keep our streets free from the
threat of mainly home grown nationalist and loyalist terrorism -- were
closely involved in the surveillance and arrests. Their armed capability
was also invaluable.
Central Scotland Police deserve special credit for keeping the whole
operation tight. With large parts of their headquarters at
Randolphfield, Stirling, cordoned off, office staff were told a large
drugs operation was under way. Unfamiliar faces were explained as
Customs men and part of the car park was signposted for them.
At one stage, the huge operation involved around 200 Central Scotland
officers, more than half the operational strength of the force on any
given day. At the same time, MI5 agents were helping run the operation
with Commander Colin Tucker. The daily planning meetings were held in
the boardroom at Randolphfield, chaired by Detective Chief
Superintendent John Ogg, head of Central Scotland CID.
The operation was not without its lighter moments. While the local
police were very conscious that one slip of the tongue by one officer
could have alerted the terrorists, the English arrived in force, replete
with Essex-man accents, English number plates, and large amounts of
large denomination English notes.
They were quickly provided with ghost number plates and told to change
their money. Their accommodation also had to be dispersed out of the
Central Scotland area, away to Glasgow and Edinburgh, to avoid, as one
local officer put it, having them fall over each other.
In the end, the rivalries were submerged to thwart what could have
been an IRA campaign of devastating consequences. Mr Wilson said: ''We
were faced with a challenge, the scale and nature of which we had never
met before. We required a great deal of guidance but we kept control of
the whole operation from day one until the very last day.
''It was very much a Central Scotland Police operation assisted by
others. I am enormously proud of this force and everyone in it. We spent
around #3m in manpower, hidden costs, and cash but I could not go to the
police authority and ask them for it. We had to manage our resources as
best we could until the arrests were made.''
Mr Wilson was then able to go to the police committee who backed his
successful request to the Scottish Office for assistance.
While the vast operation was taking place, the force had to maintain a
service to the public as near normal as possible. Mr Wilson admits that
in some respects that suffered.
At the outset, he acknowledged, they had not been fully aware of just
how active the Sauchie cell was. As the full picture emerged, it also
became obvious that Fryers and Jack were conscious of their own
security. On one occasion, a neighbour reported men behaving
suspiciously in the area -- MI5 operatives -- who were explained away as
social security snoopers.
''Every day, the cover could have been blown, yet we got through
without a major hitch. We learned many lessons. It was also very early
days for the security service to be involved in anti-terrorist activity
and I think they probably learned the most,'' said Mr Wilson.

NIGHT: An Exploration of Night Life, Night
Language, Sleep and Dreams
By Al Alvarez
Jonathan Cape, #15.99 (pp 288)
Reviewed by ALAN BOLD
WISHING someone a good night after a bad day is wishful thinking.
Daydreams are nothing compared to nightmares and we can have five of
those in a normal night as Al Alvarez reminds his readers. As if they
needed reminding.
I vividly recall my worst night as if I had just had it, though it
happened in 1956. I was an unlucky 13-year-old the day I was told my
father had been found drowned in Orkney. That night I drifted into a
dream and did nothing to come closer to my father who was trying to walk
towards me but only treading water in the dark. Freud, who defined the
dream as a wish-fulfilment, would have interpreted this one as an
attempt to escape from the father-figure. I had not read Freud at the
time. I was simply in the dark.
Long before my father died I disliked the dark for setting scenes in
my mind that made me think of sleep as a nightly rehearsal for death.
Night meant nightmares for me -- and Alvarez who admits he ''hated
sleep'' as a young lad in London. He was 12 when the Blitz cured his
fear of the dark: ''When every night brought violence and the threat of
death . . . there was no longer any need for me to be afraid of my own
night within the night.'' He is now a nocturnal creature who wanders in
the dark and wonders why he was haunted by night horrors in his
middle-class home. At least he suffered in style.
He reckons he was horrified by the childish thought that he would
mature into a monster which brings him to the subject, or subjects, of
The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson, Alvarez thinks,
created Jekyll and Hyde because he ''split his talent in two'' trying to
shake off nightmarish horrors in his head. Certainly there's a whole
lotta shaking going in Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde -- the doctor has the
heebie-jeebies after the demon drink changes him -- but there are more
than two sides to every story by Stevenson. Alvarez likes to judge
things dualistically: night and day, light and dark, right and wrong.
Freud, for example, was wrong in Alvarez's opinion. Freud
misinterpreted dreams since, believing the brain could only react to the
external world, he had no conception of the brain's ability to create
information independently. Eugene Aserinsky ''got it right'',
discovering that dreams occur during bouts of rapid eye movement when
the brain is going about its own business.
If Freud misinterpreted dreams, Alvarez oversimplifies Aserinsky,
attributing to him the idea that a dreamer looks like ''a very picture
of death'' as he ''runs, flies, talks, weeps, makes love, and all
without stirring a muscle''. Dreamers exercising their eyes look lively
enough as Alvarez knows but he is more interested in sad poetic images
than in scientific accuracy so argues by analogy and makes observations
like this: ''Falling asleep is like deep-sea diving, the progress is
down and down.'' One could as easily observe that falling asleep can be
as uplifting as floating, though that would not do for Alvarez who gets
a lift going down.
Obviously, Alvarez is not the most comforting of critics. A
cheerleader for the confessional poetry of Sylvia Plath who killed
herself in 1963, he made his own confession in The Savage God (1971):
''I am a failed suicide.'' One miserable Christmas he swallowed 45
sleeping pills but lived to tell the tale in grand style in his study of
suicide. His new book is a study of night as a preparation for ''the
darkness of death, the night that gets us all in the end, the night that
no amount of electric light will ever illuminate''. I cannot see Night
becoming a popular bedside book.
I see Night in the strong light of Alvarez's opinions on everything
under the sun. He writes well even when wrong. He insists that
''paranoia is the natural, archaic response to night'' which sounds
impressive until you examine the assertion and question its concept of
nature. He claims it was Coleridge's ''nature to be fascinated by
whatever troubled him most'' but I suspect Alvarez is mostly speaking
for himself.
Alvarez's first critical success, The Shaping Spirit (1958), took its
title from Coleridge's poem ''Dejection''; Night names ''Dejection'' as
the finest of all Coleridge poems, ''Kubla Khan'' as the greatest of all
dream poems, Coleridge as ''a great literary critic, prodigiously
intelligent and well read''. Equalling Coleridge's achievement is beyond
Alvarez's wildest dreams yet Night is an admirably determined effort to
do what Coleridge did in his day. Alvarez makes the most of his misery.

THE SCOTTISH HISTORICAL REVIEW, Special
Issue (Vol LXXIII, 1; No 195)
Edinburgh University Press, #15 per year (pp 144)
BOUGHT AND SOLD FOR ENGLISH GOLD?
Explaining the Union of 1707
By Christopher A. Whatley
Economic &amp; Social History Society of Scotland (pp 59)
Reviewed by PAUL H SCOTT
THIS special issue of the Scottish Historical Review is a
comprehensive, illuminating, and self-critical account of the current
state of Scottish historical studies in our universities. It consists of
the five papers and the responses to them given to a symposium in
Strathclyde University in September, 1993, to launch a new research
centre in Scottish history.
Virtually all the leading specialists in all periods took part. They
had much to congratulate themselves about. As Thomas Devine says in his
preface, there has been a renaissance in the study of Scottish history
since the 1970s and an impressive expansion in the quantity and quality
of scholarly publication.
The work of historians in the last 20 years or so has given us a new
understanding of the Scottish past and of the reasons for our present
plight. Much of it is fascinating and intellectually stimulating; but
incredibly our schools seem to continue in blissful ignorance of it.
Such history as they teach is still largely limited to a misleading
Anglocentric view of the world which is as dead as the dodo or the
Empire. As Allan MacInnes says, the neglect of Scottish history in the
schools is shameful, especially as there is evidence of a popular thirst
for it.
Clearly there is a need for a drastic reform in the attitude of the
schools. This was the object of the Saltire Society pamphlet, Why
Scottish History Matters, to which several of the papers refer. R A
Houston misses the point when he says that the title betrays a problem.
It is precisely because there is a serious problem that the pamphlet was
needed as one shot in a campaign.
In the course of his paper Michael Lynch says that the work of
Christopher Whatley and others ''have made many of the old certainties
of an economic high road to Union obsolete''. In fact, the more the
origins of the Treaty of 1707 are studied, the more apparent it is that
there is no substance at all in the Victorian myth that the Union was a
bargain over trade. P W J Riley, who has studied the question far more
thoroughly than any other English historian, concluded that trade
''hardly entered'' into the real motives.
I have spent much time on the surviving evidence, which is
considerable, and I agree with him. So far from the Union helping
Scottish trade, it did such damage to it that it took the Scottish
economy about 50 years to recover. The Scottish trading community knew
that the Union would be harmful to their interests. That is why they
petitioned strenuously against it.
It is therefore very surprising to find that the same Christopher
Whatley in his new pamphlet, without any new evidence or arguments,
returns to the old and discredited orthodoxy. He tells us confidently,
as though it were a matter of ascertainable fact, that ''the prospect of
obtaining protected trading opportunities persuaded a majority (of the
Scottish Parliament) to opt for union''. He gives a convoluted and
partial account of the circumstances and distorts the views of a number
of people including Andrew Fletcher, Walter Scott, and Linda Colley.
The negotiation of the Treaty was not a real negotiation because both
teams were appointed by London and the Scottish one consisted almost
entirely of placemen, appointed, paid, and instructed by London. A
majority of the Scottish Parliament were induced to ratify it by clauses
directed to their self-interest and by the belief that the alternative
was invasion and the imposition of worse terms.     The search for an
alternative explanation is an attempt to make the Union respectable by
concealing the fact that it was a takeover by a larger country of a
smaller one at a time when it was particularly vulnerable. Such attempts
have more to do with propaganda than scholarship.

PHEW. It's exhausting sitting through a solid 90 minutes -- no
half-time -- of the gymnastic piano playing of Orange's most famous
export since William and Mary: Michel Petrucciani.
Edinburgh punters, obviously already keyed into Petrucciani's kind of
jazz, were packed into the Queen's Hall last night for Assembly Direct's
first of his Scottish gigs.
From note one Petrucciani commanded absolute attention. Excellent
value for money, he had been playing continuously for 50 minutes before
he opened his mouth to greet his adoring audience. There were no gaps
between numbers: each tune just evolved, effortlessly it seemed, into
the next. Drifting from standard to Petrucciani original to another
standard was like floating on a jazz cloud.
Best of all the innumerable tunes he played was Bill Evans's haunting
Autumn Leaves -- Petrucciani's interpretation, with its walking left
hand and its flurries of right, brilliantly evocative. From Autumn
Leaves we took boogie woogie which was more like Meade Lux Lewis's Honky
Tonk Train Blues than Ellington's A Train.
The last (pre-encore) number -- in particular -- was a knock-out; and
an excellent example of the performer's wit. It opened sounding like an
Arabian desert fantasy and you would have been forgiven for anticipating
A Night in Tunisia. Instead it became the most exquisitely atmospheric
interpretaion of Caravan; a showcase for Petrucciani's breathtaking
dexterity and pianistic sense of humour.
Style-wise, Petrucciani isn't easily pigeon-holed, but his sound is
highly distinctive. He appears to have absorbed all genres of jazz piano
and they all co-exist in his playing.
All that was missing was an interval -- 90 minutes is a long time for
an audience to concentrate, though Petrucciani clearly had no problem.
Catch him -- if you can still get a ticket -- tonight at Glasgow's City
Hall.

IT was meant to be the classic operation, involving well over 100
agents, which would prove conclusively that MI5 had a vital new role in
fighting terrorism now the Cold War had ended.
However, it all went wrong at a crucial stage in what was otherwise a
huge success.
Everyone had been put on red alert at lunchtime on Wednesday, July 14,
1993. At least four teams of surveillance officers were either on Hugh
Jack's tail or keeping a close watch on his movements as he made the
two-mile journey from his Sauchie home to the turkey farm where he
worked.
Three unmarked police cars carrying armed officers, who were to
protect the ''spooks'', joined the convoy that followed Jack. Several
other mobile units, certainly as many cars again, were stationed in the
area in case the suspect varied his routine and headed in another
direction.
It was the vital day in the operation. An arrest had been made in
London that morning and Jack was to be arrested minutes after arriving
at his workplace. It was crucial that the watchers did not lose track of
Jack. Having learned of his conspirator's arrest in London on a
television news broadcast, he could well have attempted to make a
getaway.
Yet Yankee Dollar -- Jack's codename -- was out of sight for eight
minutes. Incredibly, the MI5 watchers had assumed he would follow his
usual routine after his Nissan turned into the farm track by driving
straight to Gartmorn Hill farm. It was a journey of three-fifths of a
mile and should have taken 2 minutes 20 seconds.
Not one of the scores of MI5 agents involved in the operation had been
ordered to cover this blind spot. In ''spookese'', Jack was not ''under
control''.
It was an amazing lapse. Instead of heading straight to work, Jack
turned into another track that took him to Gartinny Wood, where he hid a
cache of Semtex in dense undergrowth.
The surveillance officers were in a state of near panic. Rightly so.
Unknown to them, he could have carried on along the track to a main
road.
When Jack eventually appeared at the farm and was arrested, it was
soon realised the opportunity to catch him red-handed with Semtex in his
possession had gone.
A surveillance camera outside Jack's flat could not prove conclusively
that, when he left home that lunchtime, the bag he was carrying was a
holdall. The defence claimed it was a black bin bag.
MI5, therefore, had to rely on the visual sightings of two police
constables who had been watching the flat that day.
The whole MI5 operation in the Clackmannanshire and Stirlingshire
areas in the late spring and summer of 1993 was somewhat bizarre.
Well over 100 MI5 agents, with a variety of English accents, became
intimate with areas of Scotland that few native-born Scots know well. It
is incredible that, with so many English men and women flooding the
scene, the operation remained secret. In fact, many locals had more than
an inkling of what was afoot.
As the weeks went by, the surveillance operation continued to grow.
Hidden cameras were pointed at the front and rear entrances of 25 Loch
Brae, another targetted the area of a nearby telephone kiosk, a third a
garage that Jack rented from the council, and yet another the home of
Jack's sister in Park Crescent, Sauchie. In all probability, there were
more hidden cameras in the area.
Pictures were transmitted to Alloa police station, where they were
monitored by MI5 agents, and a tracking device was fixed to Jack's car.
A headquarters with a sophisticated communications base was set up
seven miles away at Stirling in a massive hi-tech and logistical
operation.

SHELTER
By Jayne Anne Phillips
Faber, #14.99 (pp 300)
Reviewed by CARL MacDOUGALL
JANE Anne Phillips's stories are compressed and fluent, slivers of
experience that vibrate long after their first reading. She treats her
characters with understanding, warmth, and sympathy and has an enviable
gift of entering the psyche of the opposite sex, of treating them with
care and precision.
Her technique swoops on the reader. She can dazzle with a series of
images which works wonderfully well in single stories, but when this
technique is transferred to a novel it can lose its immediacy, become
repetitive and slightly predictable.
In setting out to compensate, she has created a novel of great power
and richness, a new and fresh fiction where plot is related through a
series of intense images and narrative moves from scene to scene,
changing from one character's perspective to another. The technique
clearly sprang from cinema, but it takes such references for granted,
moving fiction beyond cinema, recognising its influence and using it as
a springboard into something new. It is a wonderful, in places
thrilling, achievement.
The movement between scenes is important. On the face of it she has
dispensed with describing characters or their motivation, concentrating
on her facility for language and a strong sense of psychological purpose
to carry the narrative forward. This is as far removed from
straightforward storytelling as it is possible to be, where the
narrative process is suspended while an individual aspect is
investigated. This narrative does not move in a linear fashion; indeed,
there are places where it appears not to move at all.
It may be possible to conclude this is the ultimate post-Modernist
text, a place where narrative has been abandoned, for there are no
stories as such, no chapters. Rather Phillips sets the scene, provides
the characters and location, and delivers the results of her
investigation.
She also dispenses with paragraphs in the usual sense. Rather, there
is a change of angle, a shift of focus, maybe even a break in the
action. It also means individual sentences are longer and richer than we
have recently come to expect. One can open this novel at almost any page
and find a sentence of such clear, poetic quality that it is almost
impossible not to continue reading.
Which puts the emphasis firmly on language, its meaning and flow, a
technique which lays demands on the reader. It means taking the writer
on trust. It also involves concentration, for this is not an easy read.
The subject has been tackled many times. In the summer of 1963 a troop
of Girl Guides are camping in West Virginia. Two pairs of friends, Lenny
and Cap and Alma and Delia, are simultaneously bored by the camp
rituals, morning reveille, evening camp fire, and the daily allocation
of chores, and fascinated by their burgeoning sexuality. Masculinity is
far away.
Buddy Carmody's stepfather is a drunken child molester who taunts his
wife's son for what he thinks is effeminacy, and while all the girls
fancy Frank, Parson -- a former convict converted to Christ -- is
haunted by the dark. There is a continuous fusion of dark and light,
reality and truth, dream and waking, past and present, angels and
devils. They lift the narrative beyond a simple rites-of-passage story
or a tale of sexual awakenings.
Just as the camp chores are repetitive and the landscape unyielding,
so we return and trawl a number of locations, seeking their meaning and
significance, finding the mystery and terror of place mingling with the
characters who invade each other's consciousness, experiencing something
they will never forget, something which will shape them forever.
Phillips: fresh fiction.

<TEXT>
THE Old Bailey conviction of bomber Robert Fryers has convinced senior
detectives that, shortly before calling a ceasefire, the IRA was rapidly
running out of volunteers.
In some ways, Rab ''Fatman'' Fryers was an unlikely person to be sent
to mainland Britain to head a bombing campaign.
A well-known Republican in Belfast, where he owned a former council
house, hardman Fryers, who is married with three children, could always
be relied upon not to maintain a low profile.
A bouncer in a Belfast nightclub and IRA enforcer, he weighed 20 stone
and made a striking visible impression, although he has since lost 6st
in prison.
He was certainly not a person who liked to melt into a crowd.
Days before his London bombing mission and while he was waiting for
the car containing the explosives, he was lording it up in a hotel in
the South Mimms area of the capital.
Fryers knocked back pints, sang Irish folk songs, and chatted up a
party of female school teachers.
He was the life and soul of the party and the centre of attention
among the women.
On the other hand, he was a hardened terrorist -- a bomb maker who,
unusually, had lasted a long time.
He visited the UK regularly but had always evaded capture.
His Republican background is hard-line, including internment without
trial at the Maze prison, from which he was released in 1975.
His life was devoted to the philosophy that the bomb and bullet were
the only way to reunite Ireland. Fryers comes from the New
Barnsley-Ballymurphy area of West Belfast, associated with many of the
terrorists' key players.
A measure of his high standing is that he belonged to the
organisation's own security team, a ruthless group which ''polices'' all
IRA activities -- uncovering informers, stamping on petty criminals in
nationalist areas, and ensuring the secrecy which is the terrorist's
lifeblood.
One Belfast police source said: ''To be a member of the IRA's security
team means that the organisation has complete trust in you. You would be
very well thought of and would command the confidence of the most senior
officers of the IRA because of the importance of the work.''
Belfast sources also confirm Fryers was an expert shot and bomb
planter -- the complete terrorist and the obvious choice to head the
London campaign. It was this high profile in Belfast, where key IRA
players are under regular surveillance, which led to his capture.
As he travelled the motorways between Sauchie and London, once with
bombing- making equipment and once with a bomb, he drove at up to
100mph.
His vehicle had a bad oil leak and he had to make frequent stops to
allow the engine to cool. At times he, and those keeping watch over him,
wondered if he would make it to London on his final journey as a free
man.
Had his mission to London been a success for the IRA, the resulting
napalm-style explosion would have had devastating effects.
Those nearby might have escaped shrapnel from the initial Semtex blast
but they could not have escaped the fireball that would have followed.
The device Fryers had manufactured in Sauchie, with which he was
caught red handed as he waited to catch a bus into Central London on his
way to breach the ring of steel around the City, had never been seen
before on the mainland.
Recruiting a man such as Fryers to run an active service unit suggests
to police that the IRA was beginning to get desperate.
His involvement in an active service unit was just as unlikely as that
of Dr Feilim Patrick O'Hadhmaill, the lecturer at the University of
Central Lancashire in Preston, who was jailed for 25 years at the Old
Bailey in November on terrorist charges.
He was close to the policy makers and a man of his status in the IRA
would never previously have been directly involved in bombings.
The fact both these men were involved on the front-line confirms the
suspicions of senior detectives that shortly before the ceasefire, the
IRA were suffering serious recruiting difficulties.
Fryers had three previous convictions, one for being in possession of
a false British visitor's passport. For that, he had been fined #150.
Fryers' brother, Gerald, was jailed for 22 years in 1980 on serious
terrorist offences.
He was one of those who escaped from the Maze three years later and is
still at large.

Jonathan Cape, #35 (pp

Reviewed by
IAN BELL
THE last letter reproduced in this book, composed on New Year's Day
1990 to the actress Coral Browne, contains all the hopeless presentiment
of one who has long pleaded that his correspondence be burned. ''My next
cause for alarm will be David Marr's biography,'' Patrick White writes
at the age of 78, ''if he finishes it before I die.''
As it happens, Miss Browne did destroy all but two items of a ''large
correspondence from PW''. Mr Marr, meanwhile, did indeed produce his
biography, and Patrick White did expire shortly before it appeared in
1991.
But Australia's Nobel laureate, you can't help but feel, got the worst
of the deal.
This is, without doubt, a remarkable collection by a remarkable artist
-- ''a master of English prose,'' as Marr rightly says -- but it is a
troubling volume. In a note, the editor states that White kept no copies
of his correspondence, and that all the letters he received were thrown
away.
Further: ''As friends and relatives died and bundles of his own
letters came back to him, White destroyed them all.''
Partly, it seems, this sprang from a desire to maintain his privacy --
''always burning and burning'' -- and partly from a need to purify his
imagination. Yet in the mid-80s White had a change of heart, issuing a
''general direction'' to friends, families, and libraries to assist his
biographer, who states ''the cause was simple: privacy was not now the
issue; the biography was . . .''
Simple? Granting permission for this edition, White still insisted he
was glad so many letters (including a cache from his lover of 40 years)
had been destroyed. Yet for all the ''burning and burning'', Marr has
amassed 3000 items, of which some 600 are reproduced here. In other
words, ''PW'' wrote an enormous number of these things, insisted for
decades that they be burned, but contradicted the belief of a lifetime
by allowing their resurrection for a biography that was giving him
''cause for alarm''.
He was never an easy man. Sometimes sour, sometimes cruel, often
brusque, and a patriotic republican who could excoriate Australia as a
big country with a small mind. He was gay, of course, yet that was never
a public issue, and his private life was inviolable until the Nobel jury
intervened in 1973. Even afterwards, White resisted becoming a creature
of the media. Letters may have been a release for a fecund writer who
avoided pontifical statements.
Whatever you think of him as an artist -- in justice, perhaps, a taste
hard to acquire but worth the effort -- White was clear in his own mind.
Discussing Voss in 1963 with Manfred Mackenzie, Sydney academic and
''symbol hunter'', he writes: ''I read The Wasteland when I was an
undergraduate. I have never read Four Quartets, although a learned
Australian has found that I have lifted all the symbols from that work
and put them straight into Voss. I have not read Laforgue . . . Nor have
I read The Golden Bough, and only a very, very little Dante . . .''
The attitude is of a writer who was self-consciously his own man.
This might be taken as typically Australian, yet White embodied his
country's contradictions rather than its cliches -- gay in a
preposterously macho land; intellectual in a nation afflicted, for so
many years, with a prejudice against culture; republican in a state long
run by Her Majesty's most devoted subjects.
This collection contains much fun (David Owen, encountered in London,
judged cranky and self-obsessed), some sadness (''PW'' can seem a
mountain of loneliness), and the usual family troubles (White did not
care for most of the other Whites). He emerges as that rarest of
writers, one who matches his own estimation.
White's ego seems to have been armoured with honesty, for example
hushing loose talk of ''greatness'' with the simple truth that ''only
time will show''. He adds, six years after receiving the Nobel Prize:
''Look down at the list of the winners and you will see that half of
them have lapsed into nonentity.''
With friends he is full of advice, affection, and wisdom; with fellow
writers he is all business and art. Thus, to David Malouf: ''I wonder
whether you have seen Bertolucci's 1900? . . . It should be seen by all
the people who won't go near it.''
As should this book. Oddly, however, these wonderful letters in the
end serve only to engender renewed respect for the integrity of the
pyre.
''PW'' might just have relished the contradiction.

ALLAN LAING ENJOYS SOME LITERARY LISTENING
IHAVE before me a copy of Host, a new horror novel by best-selling
author Peter James published by Penguin. In order to enjoy it I require
an Apple Macintosh with 4MB Ram, System 7 or later, 4.7MB or more space
on my hard drive, Quicktime, and Hypercard or Hypercard Player.
Host doesn't have pages between its hardback cover. It has two
computer disks. It is, I am led to believe, Britain's first electronic
book. Which (correct me if I am wrong) means that it isn't a book -- at
least not in my book. In any case, life is too short and I am computer
illiterate. Host remains unread.
What we have here is the latest development in the literary sidetrack
of the 1990s. The book that talks to you. Now, call me old-fashioned if
you will but books, good and bad, have pages with writing on them. Books
are literature.
But we live in an age when people -- normal, intelligent, literate,
people -- seem to lack either the time or the inclination to sit down
and read books. Papers, magazines, comics . . . yes. But actual books?
Apparently not. So the publishing industry has re-invented its
lifeblood. Now every self-respecting novel is issued, not only in print,
but also in the form of the spoken word. Audiobook tapes are the height
of laziness. There can be no denying that fact. But it has to be said,
grudgingly perhaps, that they can also be perfect literary companions.
It is a wonderful fact of life that there are far too many good books in
the world for one reader to plough through. But with audiobooks as a
supplement to your literary diet, you can double your reading list at a
stroke. The key is to get yourself a Walkman. That way you can play them
on the bus or in the train. You can play them while you're doing the
garden or the housework.
And so, dear reader, this dear reader found himself with a broad
selection of recently published audiobooks to cast a critical eye over.
The first thing to bear in mind is the fact that, with a few exceptions,
all the novels which are issued on tape are abridged versions.
It is, however, an absolute treat to listen to first-rate actors
reading first-rate fiction out loud. For instance, Christopher
Ravenscroft (Detective Inspector Burden in ITV's Inspector Wexford
Mysteries) is the ideal voice choice for a triple cassette pack of Ruth
Rendell novels from Random House. Here we have three stories, starting
with her first, From Doon With Death, and leading up to one of her most
recent, Kissing The Gunner's Daughter (#19.99).
Similarly, Anna Massey is perfectly cast as the narrator in Mary
Wesley's A Sensible Life (Hodder Headline Audiobooks, #7.99), a
wonderful love story set amid the elegant, civilised, middle-class Brits
who holidayed in pre-war Brittany. And who else but Derek Jacobi could
read Ellis Peters's A Rare Benedictine (Hodder Headline, #7.99), three
vintage Brother Cadfeal tales of intrigue and treachery in Middle Ages
Shropshire?
But, if these are good, there is even better in Theatre Royale (Hodder
Headline, #19.99), a glorious triple-pack collection of radio
transcriptions featuring Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir Ralph Richardson
performing dramatisations of literary classics. Recorded in the 1950s,
these evocative performances capture the marvellous theatrical style of
post-war radio, complete with dramatic orchestrations. Sir Larry reads
Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens while Sir Ralph brings to
life Somerset Maugham and Joseph Conrad.
Ravenscroft: ideal voice.
Massey: perfectly cast.

<HEADLINE>No chance for those caught in 'napalm-type' bomb fireball</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EXPERTS believe that the Sauchie blast incendiary bomb would have
caused deaths, serious injury, and extensive damage had the police not
apprehended Robert Fryers as he waited for a bus into Central London.
Had it gone off, it would have had a devastating effect. People
hundreds of metres from the Semtex blast were at risk from shrapnel.
However, because of the inclusion of two litres of petrol in the device,
those caught in the resulting fireball stood no chance.
This ''napalm-type'' bomb had never been seen in London previously.
It was a simple but deadly device carried casually in a small holdall
over his shoulder. Its most sophisticated components were to protect the
bomber.
It contained a 2.5kg block of Semtex; an electrical detonator; a time
power unit; and a milk bottle containing 1.9 litres of petrol.
Batteries, insulating tape, and wiring purchased in a Woolworths store
in Stirling were also incorporated.
An essential component in the bomb was a memo park timer.
Manufactured in Switzerland, the innocent use of this device is to
warn motorists that their time is about to run out at a parking meter.
The timer can run for an hour before a buzzer sounds.
The IRA, however, with only a slight change has developed memo park
timers to deadly use.
They are modified by sticking a nail or rivet on top. Once the dial is
set to whatever times is selected, it carries the nail in the direction
of a small metal post. When contact is made it sets off the detonator
and the bomb explodes.
On this particular device, the safety features included a white piece
of plastic placed over the post to insulate it and ensure there was no
accidental contact.
In addition, a small section had been cut away from the bomb's cover
through which the bomber would be able to see if there was a light
coming from a small bulb. This would give warning if the current was
live.
A third safety feature involved the removal of a small wooden peg to
enable an arm to come out of a micro switch to complete the connection.
Priming the bomb would have been a matter of moments. Removing the
plastic from the post, pulling out the wooden peg, and turning the memo
park timer to the required time before detonation.
Police believe that the cache hidden in Gartinny Wood by Jack was
intended to bring carnage not only to London but other major cities such
as Manchester and Birmingham.
Only the massive intelligence operation prevented this.
A blue Ford Escort 1.3GL -- essential to the plans of the Provisional
IRA active service unit based at Sauchie -- was last spotted boarding a
ferry from Cairnryan in Dumfries and Galloway, bound for Northern
Ireland, before it reappeared weeks later at the Scratchwood service
station on the M1.
Despite an exhaustive investigation, the police and MI5 have never
been able to discover how it was somehow spirited back into the UK with
17.5kg of Semtex and bomb-making equipment hidden in the boot area of
the car.
On its mysterious journey back to Britain it conveyed material for the
planned incendiary device intended for detonation in Central London, and
sufficient equipment for six similar bombs.
The Escort, registration number DEM 118Y, was bought by a Seamus Smith
on June 15, at Wembley Car Auctions. Mr Smith gave a false address in
Chapter Road, Neasden.
Also that day, a Declan Smith, giving details of the Escort, took out
RAC membership at the motoring organisation's office at Brent Terrace.
Again Chapter Road was given as an address.
These areas were a short distance from Staples Corner, where the
Escort was eventually to end up on July 14, shortly before Fryers'
arrest. Police believe it was no coincidence the addresses were all from
the one area. Clearly, this part of North London was well known to the
IRA cell. Fryers himself had lived there before moving to Sauchie.
On June 16, a Mr Smith booked the Escort on to the P &amp; O ferry sailing
from Cairnryan to Larne. The next appearance of the Escort was at the
Scratchwood service station in July.
From then on, teams of surveillance officers from Scotland Yard and
MI5 tailed its every movement -- from the service station to Sauchie and
then back to the London area and Staples Corner.
On the motorways, Fryers often travelled at about 100 mph and forces
along the route had to be warned not to stop the speeding vehicle.

THE former wife of a solicitor who was jailed for a #4m fraud,
yesterday staved off a threat to evict her from her luxury home in
Edinburgh's New Town over mortgage arrears of #666,000.
Mrs Helen McCabe was due to be evicted from her #250,000 home on
Monday by sheriff officers acting on the authority of a court decree
granted in favour of Skipton Building Society.
At the Court of Session yesterday, however, Lord Cameron granted an
order to Mrs McCabe which will allow her to continue living in
Northumberland Street, at least for the time being.
In 1991, John McCabe was jailed after admitting a #4m fraud on banks
and building societies, including the Skipton.
Miss Lucy Keane, counsel for Mrs McCabe, told Lord Cameron yesterday
that the Skipton had begun proceedings against the McCabes in Edinburgh
Sheriff Court in February 1991 to repossess the house.
A decree was granted in favour of the Skipton, as was a warrant to
evict Mrs McCabe, who later failed with two appeals to the Court of
Session.
She then raised separate proceedings in the Court of Session against
the building society to have the standard security over her home set
aside. Her action was dismissed.
Last year, she applied to the Scottish Legal Aid Board for legal aid,
to fund an appeal to the House of Lords over both Court of Session
cases, but her application was refused.
She now wants to challenge that refusal by way of a judicial review
and argued that since her home was at the centre of the legal actions,
it would be prejudicial to evict her.
Miss Gail Joughin, for the Skipton, said the mortgage had not been
paid since 1990 and arrears currently stood at #666,711. Mrs McCabe was
effectively living rent and mortgage free.
Lord Cameron said that he had a degree of sympathy with the building
society but had decided to suspend the the eviction until the issue of
the judicial review could be determined.
Senior and junior counsel had given an opinion that there was a
reasonable basis for Mrs McCabe going to the House of Lords and for
seeking judicial review of the legal aid board's decision.

There is concern about the Pope's
health as he returns to Rome, and
many are seen as having potential
for the role of pontiff
THE appearance is frail, the shoulders stooped, and about the face,
sometimes, there is that haunted look of those who have touched the
limit of mortality. But at the close of this odyssey through Asia and
Oceania John Paul's voice still sounds undiminished, resonant,
expressive, and determined, and this has prompted speculation that he
has finally shaken off the poor health which has plagued him since last
spring when he fell and underwent hip replacement surgery.
During the past 11 days rejuvenation appears to have seeped into him
by way of ecstatic welcomes, first in the Philippines, where 4,000,000
worshippers attended an open-air Mass in Manila, then in Papua, New
Guinea, where the far smaller crowds counted just as much.
Now, as he ends his voyage, which has also taken him to Australia and
Sri Lanka, the Pope returns to Rome, for him the memory of such
unquestioning exuberance offering proof that his papacy is not in
decline.
As for those bothersome press inquiries about whether he is fit for
such journeying, the Pope, elected in 1978, pretends to jab at
journalists with his cane and replies wryly: ''Whoever is alive at the
end will see.'' It is left to papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls to
provide a less cryptic judgment: ''The leg is not painful,'' he says,
''but movement is limited. The Pope is holding up well.''
Yet, despite the energetic rapport with the faithful, anxiety and
rumour have not entirely disappeared. In most respects this is
inevitable. John Paul II is a man of 74, the victim, 13 years ago, of a
terrorist's bullets, the survivor of a non-malignant tumour which none
the less demanded a temporary colostomy in 1992, the sufferer of a
dislocated shoulder, and that broken right leg. More than anything its
slowness to heal last year obliged him to confront intimations of
infirmity and very reluctantly he cancelled trips to Belgium and the
United States.
After months of meticulous planning that decision was a
public-relations disaster for the Vatican. But what most fuels negative
discussion about his health is how fast this exceptionally athletic and
peripatetic pontiff has visibly grown old. Naturally gregarious, he has
been a virtual recluse in the Vatican during recent months, leading many
to suspect that his illness is not so much physical as psychological.
There are two persistent theories, the first maintaining that the Pope
is indeed gravely sick and that recent falls were the results of
fainting spells because of bone cancer. The second more widely held view
suggests that some mental block is hindering full recovery. ''This is a
Slavic Pope, as he never ceases to remind us,'' says one Vatican
observer. ''We are talking about a very stubborn, self-sufficient, and
independent person, and when illness interrupts all that it often makes
convalescence very difficult. As a consequence lots of Romans will tell
you that what is wrong with the Pope is in his head, not his leg.''
It is well known in Rome that the Pope has infuriated his doctors by
an unwillingness to undertake regular physiotherapy but Vatican
officials are wily enough to declare a pontiff is never ill until he
dies. That does little, however, to prevent Machiavellian discussion
about the next batch of contenders for the papacy. Of the 161 members of
the College of Cardinals, only 120 (those below the age of 80) are
eligible to vote. And, as John Paul has selected at least 95% of those
during his 17-year reign, the new Pope is not likely to veer from his
line of Polish doctrinal orthodoxy.
Or is he? There is an ancient Roman motto which holds that ''He who
enters the voting room of the Sistine Chapel a Pope always leaves it a
cardinal.'' In other words, never bet on the favourite. Yet in any
current debate the names which recur illustrate division within the
Church between the sophisticates, masters of Vatican politics, and the
less worldly princes who represent Catholicism's commitment to the
developing world. Many believe the time is right for the first black
Pope, and one who would represent both these factions is Francis Arinze.
A Nigerian, aged 64, Arinze is a veteran bureaucrat, a member of the
Curial Offices but with a popular following at home. Against this his
fellow West African, Bernadin Gantin of Benin, might seem the ideal
choice. The head of the Congregation of Bishops and formerly with the
Justice and Peace Commission, Gantin is no dusty cleric but a warm,
approachable individual with an impressive air of goodness and humility.
As he is also 73, his reign would not be so long that it might run out
of steam, a consideration which will apply to any candidate.
But in Rome itself there is pressure for an Italian Pope, John Paul
having been the first non-Italian to inherit Peter's chair for 460
years. In this respect much of the lobbying revolves around three strong
personalities: Pio Laghi, aged 73, diplomat and former US nuncio, who is
on the liberal right of the Church; Bologna's pugnacious Giacomo Biffi,
aged 67, who once asserted that the notion of women priests would be
tantamount to using Coca-Cola for the consecration; and the brilliant,
charismatic Carlo Martini of Milan, the largest Catholic diocese in
Europe.
Internationally Martini, who is 68, would have a following among
free-minded Catholics. Handsome and a biblical scholar, he appears
regularly on television where he once had a chat show which motivated
this very bourgeois city into active support for the deprived. ''At one
point he was very close to John Paul,'' says a Vatican spokesman. ''It
was the Pope, in fact, who sent him to Milan from being head of the
Gregorian University in Rome.'' What goes against Martini, though, is
his populism and the fact that he is a Jesuit which means nobody can
tell him what to think.
An American Pope would seem out of the question because it would smack
of superpower imperialism. However, a pontiff with English as his native
tongue is not inconceivable. If the rift between liberals and
hard-liners became unbridgeable then a moderating figure would be
sought, and it is here that Scotland's Thomas Winning, aged 69, might be
influential.
Certainly at the recent consistory in Rome, Winning's evident
popularity with the people and the Pope himself did not escape the keen
attention of fellow cardinals. He assiduously reflects John Paul's
teaching, and he also speaks fluent Italian. Or else there is a Vinko
Puljic.
If the Apostolic College were really seeking to surprise they might
choose Sarajevo's new and imposing cardinal. A man of obvious sancity
and courage -- his house was hit by five grenades last year, but he
refuses to leave his work among survivors -- Puljic is a Bosnian Croat
and his election would obviously carry considerable diplomatic
significance in that ravaged part of the world. But age and an innocence
of Vatican politics are against him. At 49 he is by far the youngest
cardinal.
There are also two other names worth noting: the Belgian Jan Schotte,
aged 67, who heads the permanent Synod of Bishops and is one of the
Pope's confidants; and Jean-Marie Lustiger, one of the most interesting
real contenders. Born a Jew 69 years ago and sheltered by French
Catholics during the last war, this Cardinal of Paris suffered family
losses through Nazism and so, better than many, he is alert to the
echoes of racism which threaten Europe once again.
But the persistent question for the Vatican is this: how do you follow
Karol Wojtyla, that most contradictory of men, a star-turn
disciplinarian who is loved? There is no doubt his obvious physical
sufferings have gained him tremendous sympathy in recent months. He has
put dignity into pain.
And those of his staff who warned against this present tour must now
prepare for further sorties to Slovakia, Africa, Austria, and America,
where in October he will join the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of
the United Nations. Whatever his true medical prognosis, John Paul now
seems to be fighting back the shadows which hinder his self-imposed
duties as pastor to the world.

FORMER Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson is to appear in court next
month accused of drink-driving.
The player, who recently appeared on an assault charge at Glasgow
Sheriff Court, has been summonsed to appear at Liverpool Magistrates
Court on February 24, to answer a charge of driving with excess alcohol.
Ferguson, 23, failed a breath test after being stopped by police on
Merseyside before Christmas, it was revealed yesterday.
He recently signed for Everton from Rangers for #4.2m after a period
on loan, and was arrested in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of
November 20.
Earlier this month, the player appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court
charged with assaulting former Raith Rovers defender John McStay, now
with Clydebank, by butting him on the head to his injury during a
Scottish Premier League match at Ibrox in April last year.
However, a surprise move by Mr Donald Findlay, QC, to include
Glasgow's procurator-fiscal among the defence witnesses, led to the case
being postponed for a further four months.

A ''MODEL father'' who killed his 10-week-old son in a moment of
madness had his plea in mitigation accepted by a judge yesterday.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Prosser jailed the 30-year-old
soldier for six months but, because the sentence was backdated to
October when he was taken in to custody, he was released.
Francis Goodwin, a lance-corporal with the Royal Scots, admitted
killing Nathan by shaking him violently and causing his head to strike
against a hard surface or object.
The incident took place in Goodwin's home in Dinmont Drive, The Inch,
Edinburgh, on September 24 last year. The baby died from his injuries
five days later in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
Lord Prosser was given a large number of testimonials from Goodwin's
colleagues, friends, and family. He also considered a six-page letter
written by Nathan's mother, Miss Angela McMillan, and one from Goodwin
himself.
The judge said that, while the charge had orginally been murder, there
was nothing in the facts which had emerged that came remotely near to
murder. However, Goodwin had caused his child's death and that remained
a serious crime.
''I am persuaded that this is a case where the culpability is low. I
would pay particular attention to the fact that there was no deliberate
blow of any kind. There was no intention as I see it to hurt -- far less
harm your child in any material way.''
Lord Prosser said the shaking had been brief and the striking of the
baby's head had been an unintentional result of the shaking.
''That puts the case in very sharp contrast to the kind of cases with
which we are all sadly familiar, where parents or others maltreat a
child with some intention of hurt or harm.''
The judge accepted that Goodwin was a good and reliable man and urged
the Army to reconsider its decision that he should be discharged.
He added: ''It is one of life's sadnesses that people do on occasion
commit serious crime. It's always hard to know what to do in such cases.
''I have read what you wrote. I find it realistic and moving and I
take account of the suffering you have undergone in respect of what you
did.''
The judge described the letter from the baby's mother as ''brave and
good'' and thought a long sentence on Goodwin would not be in her best
interests.
Mr Stephen MacGibbon, advocate-depute, told the court that Goodwin had
served 10 years in the Royal Scots, latterly as a regimental military
policeman stationed at Fort George, Inverness-shire.
He lived with Miss McMillan and had been present at Nathan's birth.
When his duties allowed, he would return to Edinburgh at weekends to be
with his family, looking after Nathan and Miss McMillan's three-year-old
daughter to allow her to go out.
There had been no problems with Nathan until Saturday, September 24,
when Goodwin was looking after him alone.
About 2.20pm the accused made a 999 call from the flat, claiming that
Nathan had fallen after being left propped up by cushions. Paramedics
arrived but the baby was apparently not breathing and was beginning to
turn blue.
Mr MacGibbon said there had been no hope of saving the baby's life and
eventually the parents had agreed to have a life-support machine
switched off. Nathan died in his mother's arms.
He had suffered two fractures of the skull, caused by his head
striking an unyielding surface while being shaken violently.
Hospital staff were suspicious about Goodwin's story and he later
admitted to police he had shaken the child and had ''just lost it for a
few seconds''. He did not know whether Nathan's head had struck the
floor or the couch.
Mr Neil Murray QC, defence counsel, said no-one would ever know,
except Goodwin himself, if even he knew, what happened on the afternoon
he was left alone with the baby.
He described his client as a doting father. Miss McMillan was standing
by him.
''The accused has a deep sense of grief. There is nothing that can be
done to this man by way of punishment that he has not done to himself.
''He looked after this child perfectly but for this one aberration.''
None of the witnesses, including the child's mother, could imagine
Goodwin acting in a deliberately evil manner towards his son.
The mother had said: ''As far as I am concerned, he was a model
father.''

Contrary to your editorial, the SNP has never been a devolutionist
party (January 13). It has promoted Scottish independence since it was
founded 60 years ago.
I find offensive your remarks that support for a democratic party, as
the SNP clearly is, has a dangerous dimension.

I enjoyed and welcomed Christopher Sims's article on the importance of
financial sector ''invisibles'' to the UK's balance of payments (January
16). I was glad too that he explicitly recognised the importance of the
Scottish industry in all this (though he will be aware that it is not
only Edinburgh -- Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, Perth, to name but a few,
are also vital).
One niggle: he refers regularly to the City of London. This is useful
shorthand for the financial sector, but we need always to have in mind
that the ''City'' is as much a functional than a geographic concept --
income ''booked'' for the City is frequently earned elsewhere,
especially by Scottish institutions.
We should perhaps hold a contest for a more up-to-date collective
description.

Ian Lang did not tell us very much that was new in his question and
answer session with Robbie Dinwoodie about devolution (January 14).
Indeed some of his responses to what were basically concise and
pertinent questions were both ambivalent and not quite accurate.
For example, he dismissed Lord Home's advice to the Scottish
electorate -- at the time of the 1979 referendum -- to vote No as a
matter of no consequence.
Surely the former Prime Minister must have had some justification from
within the Conservative and Unionist Party hierarchy at the time that a
better devolution package could be provided?
Furthermore, Mr Lang might have acknowledged the fact that many Scots
were sadly frightened into abstention or voting No by the Scottish
National Party's equivocal propaganda that a Yes vote to them only meant
a half-way stage to complete separation from the UK.
Robbie Dinwoodie might have caused some more embarrassment if he had
reminded Mr Lang that another Tory Prime Minister, Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, used to be, like himself, a supporter of devolution although
later she also recanted.
Then there was Edward Heath, who in what became known as the Perth
Declaration, made what became another unfulfilled promise to the
Scottish people.
The Labour Party has at least been consistent in its support for
devolution.

The people of Scotland, whatever their national origins, have every
reason to fear the fanatical zeal with which John Major and his Tory
henchmen intend to keep the control of Scotland in English hands. Ever
since the time of Edward I the English have sought to control and
exploit Scotland, and ever since the Union of 1707 -- acquired,
incidentally, by treachery, not by the consent of the people -- they
have done just that.
In recent times they have moved the steel and motor industries south,
virtually closed the shipyards and coal mines, decimated the railways,
handed over control of the whisky industry to foreign companies, created
a massive recession and unemployment, and lost without trace more than
#200bn of oil revenue that should have made Scotland one of Europe's
most prosperous nations.
And we have had precious little in return. It is no accident that the
Scottish regiments have been run down and the higher echelons of the
Civil Service in Scotland, not to mention the countless quangos, filled
with English placements.
One has only to look at Chechnya to see the lengths to which a
predatory neighbour will go to prevent the loss of one of its colonies,
and its assets, or to stop its people from being masters of their own
destiny. It would rather destroy the colony altogether than countenance
the alternative.

Amid the controversy surrounding Tam Dalyell and the West Lothian
Question, few questions have been asked of his personal position on the
constitutional debate.
In 1990 Mr Dalyell, along with 48 of his Scottish Labour MP
colleagues, signed the Claim of Right document which was promoted by the
Constitutional Convention. The convention's main plank was devolution
and the Claim of Right's tenet was the sovereignty of the Scottish
people.
It is therefore surprising to find Mr Dalyell not only attacking
devolution but also supporting the principle of Westminster's continuing
sovereignty over Scotland.
No-one has asked Mr Dalyell, who is reputed to be a very principled
politician, if he actually supported the Claim of Right when he put his
signature to it. If he did, what has caused him to change his opinion?
If he did not support it, why did he sign it?
In 1992 when the Labour Party fought its Scottish campaign on the
policy of a Scottish parliament, Mr Dalyell kept extremely quiet. Why
was the West Lothian Question not an issue when the SNP were at Labour's
throats then?
There is a belief among many nationalist-leaning Labour members that
Mr Dalyell is not alone in his lack of enthusiasm for devolution.
John Major's trumpeting of English nationalism has awoken Mr Dalyell.
Those of us who recall the debacle of the 1970s over devolution are now
wondering how many other ''sleepers'' Mr Major has in Labour's Scottish
ranks.

Any change of ownership in a football club is an emotive event. True
anywhere in the world, it seems especially so in Scotland, where tribal
loyalties are intense. When Fergus McCann secured control of Celtic
after as acrimonious a battle as anyone can remember (already the
subject of two hastily and badly-written, self-serving books), he
undertook to give the fans a stake in the club.
This was greeted with some scepticism by a footballing public only too
well aware of the Hibernian disaster and the cynical and unsuccessful
Hearts prospectus issue, about which I wrote in Herald Business
recently.
When I got the Celtic prospectus I rather expected to see more of the
same. However, although the document is by no means readily accessible
to the ordinary fan (why can't professional advisers learn to explain
matters in a simple and clear manner?), and Mr McCann will remain the
controlling shareholder, it does seem that the Celtic faithful who
subscribe will get a vote and the right to be heard.
What sets this prospectus apart from the others is that it recognises
the likely motivation for subscribing and emphasises the risks. It also
states quite clearly the effect of a successful issue on the control of
the company and the purposes to which the funds raised will be put. By
having only one class of ordinary voting shares, any subsequent change
in ownership giving rise to a gain in value would benefit the fans
financially.
While one might have reservations about the differing levels of perks
and privileges on offer depending on the level of subscription, and the
resultant ''class'' structure among shareholders, the universal
franchise and degree of transparency are to be welcomed.
This is real progress even though some have and will say it's not
enough. For too long Scottish clubs have been run as the personal
fiefdoms of egocentric owners with little regard to the interests of
those without whom there would be no club, the long-suffering supporters
expected to put up with appalling conditions on the terraces and
hopelessly inadequate facilities.
Who doubts that but for the Taylor Report only the enlightened few
would have taken the steps necessary to modernise the facilities?
Football is of course a business, and indeed big business, and as such
carries attendant risk. Fans can lose their money (and did so in the
case of Hibs), but at least here the risk is clearly and repeatedly
stated.
Probably the greater risk lies in the team's performance on the field
as the share issue will give rise to heightened expectations and
disillusionment will set in quickly if the results don't come. After
all, there will be a market of sorts for the shares, and the disaffected
will be able to sell as well as desert the stadium.
The loan arrangements for the fans wishing to subscribe could be
cynically described as an attempt by the Co-op Bank to increase its
customer base. However, at an APR of 16% or so for the smallest loan, it
is probably the cheapest credit to which they have had access in recent
years. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that the better-off, those who
buy the greater number of shares, are being offered a rate closer to
10%. To those that have . . .
Mr McCann and his team (in the boardroom and on the field) are not
going to have an easy ride, and should not expect one. The progress on
the stadium development and the team building will be closely
scrutinised, and any departure from the promises implicit in the
prospectus will attract severe criticism. If, however, the openness so
far demonstrated is maintained, then Mr McCann deserves to succeed. I
for one wish him luck.

My faith in human nature was restored on reading the statement from
the parents of Allan Mitchell who, at their time of grief at the loss of
their son from necrotising fasciitis, thought to thank the hospital, the
doctors, and nurses for his care, and to absolve the child who was
alleged to have bitten him at school (January 13).
So different from the average statements we read from parents in
similar circumstances who immediately say ''We are consulting our
solicitor'' in the hope that they will make some monetary gain.

Your correspondent disapproved of the ''over-the-top'' media praise
lavished on Brian Laudrup of Rangers (January 14).
As an amateur football player and supporter who has played and watched
football in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, England, Germany,
Greece, Holland, Spain, and Sweden, I believe the media have got it
right on Brian Laudrup. He was voted third best player in the world by
the respected international football magazine World Soccer after he
inspired his country to victory in the 1992 European Championships.
Brian Laudrup, in my opinion, is simply the best.

For 40 years, and possibly more, I have been privileged to know Sir
Alexander Gibson.
I feel sure the words I write could also be on behalf of the musical
population of Scotland -- the Royal SNO, Scottish Opera, and members of
the many musical organisations throughout the country, particularly in
Glasgow and Edinburgh.
We are a people -- students, amateur musicians, singers, and the men
and women who work but find relaxation in listening to the majestic
sounds of an orchestral or operatic score. Here was a man with a gift of
genius, but he was one of us, and remained so, all his life.
Scotland would have been a poorer place without this quiet and private
person, and I trust that in all the glamour of and enthusiasm for the
present what he did for the SNO and Scottish Opera will never be
forgotten.
Fortunately we are left with the recordings of his genius in both
symphonic and operatic performances, giving us pleasure, joy, and
everlasting memories.
So, on behalf of us, the everyday person in the street, we give thanks
for Alex.

The Herald is to be congratulated for initiating an associate
conductorship with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in honour of
Sir Alexander Gibson (January 18). It is quite appropriate that his
memory shoud be perpetuated in this way.
Sir Alex made a contribution to the musical life of Scotland the like
of which will never be seen again. His legacy included a national
symphony orchestra and a national opera company of which the people of
Scotland can be justly proud.

It was with real sadness that I read of the death of Sir Alexander
Gibson (January 16).
I have often wondered why the Royal SNO Centre in Claremont Street,
Glasgow, boasts the name of Henry Wood Hall. Might this not be the
appropriate moment to rename it the Sir Alexander Gibson Hall and give
credit to the man who achieved so much here in Scotland?

WHEN the Rolls-Royce cutback was announced earlier this week, one
expert was quoted as saying that it was vital to save the research and
development side of the East Kilbride plant's work because ''it
represents the future''. If that is true of aerospace machines it is
true with regard to spiritual cybernauts, otherwise known as human
beings.
Students are not top of most people's list of best-loved groups. Along
with journalists and politicians they would be excluded from the top 10
types with whom most people would choose to be stranded on a desert
island. However, students (or undergraduates as they used to be known)
are the human equivalent of research and development. They are our
future, and it is in society's interests to see that they are encouraged
and rewarded.
When I became an undergraduate 30 years ago there was a good chance of
both. We were encouraged to aim for higher education and more or less
guaranteed decent rewards if we stayed the course. ''You are the top 2%
of the population,'' I remember being told by an unashamedly elitist
dean as I sat in a group of entrant students in St Andrews in 1965. In
those days firms like ICI and Shell toured the universities, plucking
the finest of final-year students for industry. Prior to this pot of
gold at the end of the academic rainbow, my generation were given a
grant which enabled us to have a modest but adequate standard of living.
In the vacations we had no difficulty in finding work -- seasonal or
casual stuff such as delivering the post or rolling beer barrels.
Two things have happened in the intervening 30 years. The first is
that although universities still claim society's academic elite, the
whole system of tertiary education has expanded and widened in scope. We
now have many new universities that award degrees in hotel management
and even beauty therapy. The subject matter and the status of university
education have mushroomed. Leaving aside whether this is a good thing,
it has had the effect of vastly increasing the numbers of students.
Alongside this development several other changes have taken place. The
graduate -- even from some of the prestige institutions -- no longer has
a job waiting for him, and even when he gets one it is far from secure.
Costs of living have risen so that most students have difficulty living
on the grant and have little chance of getting vacation employment in
today's world. Certainly many were able to claim social security from
the seventies onwards but the advent of student loans has made the
situation even bleaker for many students.
The National Union of Students estimates that the average sixth-former
entering higher education next year will leave #8000 in debt. The
average debt at Edinburgh University is #1200; 40% of students at
Glasgow University work part-time during the term; 15% of students at St
Andrews are considering dropping out due to financial hardship. The
grant freeze and the withdrawal of entitlement to DSS benefit in 1990
has harshened the climate.
Anxious to shift emphasis from grants to loans, the Government is in
the process of pushing through grant cuts and uprating loans. It has
resulted in a new campaign by the students at Scotland's four ancient
universities, which will be taken up next week by church leaders and
debated in the House of Lords on January 30.
The Edinburgh student president Stephen Magee concedes that in the
past students have lacked credibility because of reliance on
demonstrations. The point of the campaign is to target Parliament, which
makes the decisions. ''Many people still consider students to be a
privileged group but the evidence we have collected suggests otherwise.
These misconceptions are perhaps most strongly connected to the four
ancient universities in Scotland and so, in addition to Oxford and
London, we are working together as a unit to correct them.''
The student leaders will travel to London next week to lobby
Parliament and join church leaders for a press conference in Edinburgh
next Wednesday morning. The issue will be raised in the Lords for debate
on Monday the 30th by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Addington. He has
used the device of a ''prayer'' to do so. In the tangle of anachronistic
parliamentary practice it is not always easy for lobby groups to know if
their voice will be heard. An early day motion is likely to gather dust.
A PQ, or parliamentary question, may receive a stonewall answer. But if
this Lord's prayer can get something done it will truly be a spiritual
act (in which actions speak louder than words).
This is not a peripheral issue, with yet another pressure group
wanting more money from the State. It is an investment in our future. I
am not ashamed to be elitist about certain things. One of them is
academic standards. It should not be confused with snobbery. It is no
reflection on a person's spiritual worth that they are rated higher or
lower in academic capability. I admire the elitist gift of musicians
which I can appreciate but never hope to emulate. Similarly we need to
encourage and promote institutions for the best minds. We need
Rolls-Royce brains as well as Rolls-Royce engines.
By investing in high standards in higher education we are therefore
not talking only about a caring attitude towards students (basic as that
is), or about allowing people to further their chosen career. We are
talking about intelligent research and development in our society.

TIME marches on and leaves behind those who cannot adapt to change. I
therefore welcomed the proposal that there should be a review of Clause
4, the section of Labour's constitution that enshrines the Socialist
principles of the party.
Only two options seemed possible. That the clause would be retained,
as it is, as aspirational principles, or, that it would be revised to
make our socialist principles more relevant.
It's now clear that from the start there was a third option. The
socialist content of Clause 4 was to be lost in a mess of amorphous
generalities, and Labour remade into a non-socialist party.
Those who control the commanding heights of the economy no doubt
rejoiced at the prospect. Since Labour upset the applecart earlier this
century, they have lusted for the return of a two-party system, in which
the parties could safely alternate in government, without endangering
the status quo.
Back we would go to the ''let's pretend'' politics of minuscule
differences, dressed up as fundamental disagreements, known scornfully
as Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
At the party conference, talk was of an open, tolerant debate.
Labour's leader set the agenda. He started to make one-sided public
statements before the debate had even opened. Shadow Cabinet members
were told to conform. Anyone who takes a contrary view, in the party at
large, is an ''infantile adolescent''.
There's something familiar about this kind of language. Shades of
Leninism, which also demanded obedience to the leader and treated
dissent within the party as an ''infantile disorder''.
My fear is that Labour founded to change the status quo is to be
reshaped into a party of the status quo.
But as the Good Book more or less says: ''What doth it profit a party,
if it gains the whole House of Commons, and suffers the loss of its own
soul?''
The Labour Party isn't an employment agency for career politicians.
Tony Blair says: ''I care about the Labour Party winning the next
election.'' So do I, but not as an end in itself.
A Labour Government worthy of the name would have to address, as a
matter of principle, the colossal inequalities rampant in Britain today.
Some years ago, I read in the Financial Times an article by Jan Pen
the highly respected Dutch economist. He had analysed the distribution
of wealth in Britain and concluded that, contrary to widespread belief,
the disparity between rich and poor had not diminished but had grown in
the post-war years.
To illustrate this he projected a model of wealth distribution in this
country in terms of a march, past a fixed point, lasting one hour. The
size of each group would represent their ownership of wealth.
For the first 48 minutes midgets trooped by with only a very gradual
increase in stature. Then with eight minutes left there was a jump of 10
and 20 feet. In the last few minutes giants, bigger than high-rise
blocks, suddenly appeared.
But they were relative midgets compared to the leviathans who trundled
past in the last few seconds. Their heads had disappeared in the clouds,
reaching up to outer-space. The guv'nors had arrived.
Since then the very rich have got richer. The poor much poorer. To
think you can tackle the problems of the poor, while leaving untouched
this vast concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny super-elite, is
disingenuous.
There is another reason why we must tackle this obscenity. In economic
terms how can such giants look the rest of us in the eye and make human
contact.
From their loftiness, might we not appear as ant-like creatures who
can be trodden on without remorse? Think of the heartless economic
decisions of recent years, people thrown on the scrapheap, communities
devastated. Were we just wee beasties, abstract indices, to the decision
makers?
Wealth is power. Super-wealth is super-power. Tony Blair had lunch
with Rupert Murdoch. That's okay. Dialogue is a good thing. But Tony
hasn't had lunch with me, my next-door neighbour, or anybody in our
street.
Could it be that we aren't billionaires, don't own a big chunk of the
media, and therefore don't merit a munch with Mr Blair. We do have
votes.
Is Labour's leadership supping with the super-rich to plead that they
and their newspapers be less vicious to the party, come the next
election, than they were at the last? There would have to be a reason
for them to do so, that has nothing to do with fair play.
Is it an assurance that the super-rich have nothing to fear from a
Labour Government? But a Labour Government which leaves unchanged the
system that allows them to be super-rich, will not be able to do much,
if anything, for the poor.
The irony is that I am a supporter of reform within the Labour Party
and have campaigned for one person one vote since the seventies. I've
contempt for the arid sloganising of the hard left. I'm for the revision
of Clause 4 so that it deals with economic democracy. If political
decision making has to be accountable to the people, as a matter of
democratic principle, why not economic decision making?
Experience shows that market mechanisms are a prerequisite of economic
efficiency. Even Marx's Theory of Value presupposes a market.
I don't believe in State control of industry. It's been tried and
everywhere spawned bureaucratic and not democratic institutions.
Nationalisation isn't socialism. Bismarck nationalised the postal
services in Germany, and he was no socialist.
But I don't believe that the destiny of humankind can be left to the
untrammelled play of market forces. Laissez-faire capitalism ruled the
world from 1850 till 1950, and failed miserably. We've seen the past and
it doesn't work.
During this period there were two horrendous world wars, numerous
colonial wars, devastating slumps that produced a grotesque situation,
hitherto unknown in human history, where millions starved in the midst
of plenty.
Millions today still starve in a world of food mountains. Our
technology has outstripped our sociology. Man, who should be the master
of economics, is too often its salve. Modern economics lack a humane
ethic. A social dimension. Socialist principle.
Without a socialist Clause 4, Labour is a party of expediency.
Enmeshed in agendas not of its making. Led by events but never leading.
Having accepted the status quo, it becomes part of the system, the same
as the others. Why then vote Labour?

THE conventional wisdom here is that President Clinton got off to a
bad start two years ago because he became embroiled in a secondary and
silly controversy over gays in the military. He spent a large part of
his first few months in office battling those who opposed him on the
issue, and was finally defeated.
That, we think, with all the advantages of hindsight, was a sign of
things to come. Mr Clinton picked the wrong fight, and lost. Newt
Gingrich may be falling into the same trap.
He has promised a ''Contract with America'' which is to revolutionise
the country, stripping away the power of Washington and restoring
old-fashioned Christian, family virtues. Now he is plunging into
knock-down fights over the future of public broadcasting and whether he
should have signed a book contract with Rupert Murdoch.
The thing that tripped Bill Clinton was that a vociferous section of
his supporters ardently believed a great wrong had been done to
homosexuals by forbidding them to serve in the armed forces. Righting
that wrong would be a blow for justice and freedom, and reaffirm gay
rights in society as a whole -- there are not all that many gay
soldiers.
Mr Clinton cheerfully promised during the campaign that he would issue
an executive order ending the ban on homosexuals in the services -- and
when he was challenged to confirm his promise after the election, and to
carry it out after his inaugural, exactly two years ago, he thought he
should do so.
It was all symbolism. The left pushed, the right pulled, and Mr
Clinton spent months on this tertiary issue, instead of starting at once
on health care and welfare reform. He failed to deliver on all three
issues and those failures lost him the mid-term election.
He messed up over something trivial. The Public Broadcasting System is
equally trivial. It consumes about $170m of a federal budget that is now
over $1.5 trillion (that's million million). But it has vast symbolic
importance.
The Republicans in Congress are determined to kill it, because they
think it is elitist, liberal, probably Communist.
Democrats are determined to protect it, because it is liberal, good
for you and so on -- and because it is popular.
PBS broadcasts Sesame Street and Barney the Dinosaur, and everyone
with small children loves it. A battle royal is under way, hopelessly
distracting Mr Gingrich and his troops from the serious business of
balancing the budget, cutting the Government down to size and all those
other good things they promised.
By the time the inevitable compromise has been reached (let's cut PBS,
not abolish it), so the theory goes, Mr Gingrich will have lost his
momentum and we will be back to the usual comfortable Washington
gridlock.
The other great distraction is the Gingrich book deal. The new Speaker
signed a contract with Rupert Murdoch's publishing house, HarperCollins,
just before Christmas to do two books for an advance of $4.5m.
He has been on the defensive ever since. He had a meeting with Mr
Murdoch before the contract was signed, though they both deny the books
were mentioned. Murdoch's Fox television company is involved in a
multi-billion dollar dispute that is being decided by the federal
government.
Mr Gingrich denies any evil intent, but he didn't help himself when a
slew of telecommunications leaders were invited to meet Republicans in
Congress on Thursday. Mr Murdoch was there.
Mr Gingrich addressed them.
The House was reduced to snarling chaos on Wednesday on the issue, and
it keeps coming back. Mr Gingrich accuses the Democrats of trying to
destroy him -- which is rather comic since he reached his present
eminence by fighting the nastiest fight Washington had seen in decades.
He made himself detestable to Democrats by his constant, snide,
venomous attacks on them -- and now they are repaying him in kind.
That, at least, was easily predictable. And although the way to calm
things down is for him to turn the other cheek, give up the book deal
altogether (he has already renounced the advance), and devote himself to
sweet-talking the Democrats into a good humour, it's not in his
character. The nastiness will continue.
Meanwhile, in the Senate, Democrats are putting the brake on
Republican proposals. The Constitution may be amended, as the
''Contract' promises, but not just yet. Things are slowing down in the
House, too; Mr Gingrich promised a vote on the balanced budget amendment
by January 19, and missed.
Political momentum is a strange phenomenon, but it's real.
There is, indeed, a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the
flood, leads on to fortune. Mr Gingrich uses a contemporary metaphor,
saying that there is a window of opportunity, which lasts about 100
days, and it may be that he will recover from the first few days'
mistakes and plunge through it.
But his association with Mr Murdoch, and his refusal to back out of
it, does not look good. Murdoch has influence on three continents.
However, this is a big country and even Rupert Murdoch does not always
get his own way here.
And meanwhile the hunt, instead of keeping together in pursuit of the
real game, are galloping off after Barney the Dinosaur. Radio and
television talk-shows, public hearings and Congressional committees
spend all their time debating the merits of PBS, as though it mattered.
The clock is running. Mr Gingrich has got through about 20 of his 100
days, with nothing to show for it.

Clothes design has a lightweight reputation in industry, yet it is a
major export earner for Britain. Francesca Fearon reports on recent
export awards for the new names in fashion
REN PEARCE and Andrew Fionda, two young designers whose first
collection only hit the London catwalk last October, received the
special Newcomers Award for Export from the British Knitting and
Clothing Export Council (BKCEC) at a special gala show last week.
With their tantalising forties-inspired suits and spiral cut shirts
and evening wear, the design duo, known as Pearce Fionda, made such a
striking impression on international buyers that big orders were swiftly
placed by the normally cautious major American and Japanese stores and
Joyce in Hong Kong. The Gallery in Glasgow will also be stalking the new
collection.
''It is great to get recognition so early on,'' says Andrew Fionda.
''You can reach the threshold of the UK market quite quickly so we have
to branch out to make a living,'' says Ren Pearce.
Their award, a new initiative, was presented by the Princess Royal who
is President of the BKCEC. It is part of the annual British apparel
export awards for those who have achieved exceptional export
performance. Among recipients of the awards -- sponsored by the NatWest
Bank -- was the Hawick Cashmere Company for exporting 80% of its
cashmere/silk knitwear over the past year.
Gossard took an award for lingerie and nightwear, Jeffrey Rogers for
women's wear, and Tateossian (which also designs a special collection
for The Gallery), for jewellery.
''We began four years ago with three people and now employ 120, so it
is wonderful to achieve this recognition'' says James Thomson, managing
director of the Hawick Cashmere Company. ''It means a lot to our export
customers and our employees who've worked very hard. It is also very
important locally; it's been an exciting four years.''
Marks &amp; Spencer received the Gold Award for Outstanding Export
Achievement. Although synonymous with the British High Street, the
retailer has 622 stores world-wide and is as familiar to Parisians as it
is to the residents of Hong Kong. Its export sales account for #281m.
The BKCEC promotes the sale of British clothing and accessories
throughout the world, taking exporters to major international fashion
fairs. Huge fashion empires through to small design businesses fuel UK
clothing exports of over #2500m annually, 8% of that being British
designer merchandise, which contributes #160m to the balance of
payments. France and Italy may be better known than Britain for the
sheer scale of their fashion industries, but the British clothing and
textile industry is, in fact, the fifth largest manufacturing sector
within the UK, employing 9% of the total manufacturing workforce.
You can reach the threshold of the UK market quite quickly so we have
to branch out to make a living

Travelling is always something of a gamble but William Russell has
some tried and tested advice which should tip the odds in your favour.
THERE is nothing the single traveller or long-distance backpacker can
do to avoid being kidnapped by terrorists or guerrillas, beyond heeding
any available official advice about places and countries that are
unsafe. In the case of three young men kidnapped in India recently, they
were simply unlucky. They were not, after all, wandering the Vale of
Kashmir and official advice would not have helped. But there are things
the traveller can do to avoid getting into trouble. As one who has been
mugged, had their pocket picked, been conned, and wandered down dark
streets oblivious of the dangers, I should know.
The mugging took place in broad daylight and was just one of those
things. My pocket was picked in Venice on a night when I had dined and
wined to excess so I had only myself to blame. One dark street was in
Rio de Janeiro after I had opted for the bus home instead of a taxi. It
is difficult for strangers to fathom where Rio's buses are going and
mine did not go down the street my hotel was in, as I expected, but
hurtled along the freeway to downtown Cinelandia which, after dark, is
even more shut down than the City of London. Luckily a taxi came by just
in time, but it was disturbing to realise that I was being stalked up
the empty street by someone on the opposite pavement.
As for being conned, I listened, as did those Englishmen in Delhi, to
a plausible stranger. The trouble is that not everyone is a threat and
one has to take people on trust or you miss out on potentially
marvellous experiences. In Syria a collective taxi I was sharing with
some Syrian students broke down. One of them spoke English and warned me
that the driver was planning to demand an immense amount of money for my
fare and only to pay what they did. They then invited me to their house
on the beach for lunch. I accepted and had a marvellous afternoon.
In Poona, however, I got into conversation with an equally charming
Indian, a student from Delhi he said, who offered to show me some
temples, and did just that. At the end of the afternoon, however, he
made clear he had missed his bus home, it was my fault, and he wanted
his taxi fare because his village was a long way off. I said I did not
have a lot of money on me, which was true, whereupon he pointed out
that, as well as my pocket book, I had a money pouch inside my shirt
which must have something in it -- and he pulled it out.
After putting me in a taxi and telling the driver to take me to my
hotel, he departed happily with some four or five pounds, having first
given me his address in Delhi, which proved to be false. I was really
just paying for services rendered, but what hit me, as I walked into the
hotel, was I had never mentioned where I was staying.
Here, therefore, is a 10-point check list which might help travellers,
single or not, to avoid trouble.
* Never admit to a stranger that you are on your own. There is always
a friend back at your hotel with whom you must make contact before you
embark on the enticing trip proposed. That way you can tell the hotel
clerk where you are going and that, if you are not back at a certain
time, something has gone wrong.
* Never have all your worldly goods on you when sightseeing, only what
is necessary. The rest should be in the hotel safe along with your
passport, whatever officialdom may say about carrying it at all times.
All you really need is some convincing means of proving your identity. I
use my press card. Police or officials usually only want proof you are a
foreigner, and the form that proof takes should not matter provided it
has your picture on it. If it does matter, they can take you to your
hotel to get the passport.
* Do not use a neck pouch for your money. These are easily snatched,
and highly visible. A money belt under as many layers of clothing as you
are wearing is preferable. It is, however, the obvious place for a thief
to look should you be held up, but it will be safe from pickpockets. If
you are held up, hand the stuff over. Never resist. Do not have a go. Be
philosophical. These days virtually everything can be replaced, provided
you have kept a record of how this can be done. A leg pouch fastened
round the calf is a useful alternative hiding place, as is a pocket
inserted at the hem of one's skirt or at the base of one's trouser leg.
The important thing is to spread things around. I used a holster once,
which even I couldn't get into. It also had a tendency to slip round so
that for much of the time I looked like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
* Keep records in two places of your traveller's cheques, cash,
passport, airline ticket, and credit-card numbers, as well as any
helpline telephone numbers.
* Leave your jewels at home and wear a cheap watch.
* Your shoulder bag should be one you can wear across your body,
should never dangle from the shoulder, and should look cheap. The
flashier the bag, the greater the danger.
* Foreign Office travel advice should be sought in advance for trips
to obviously dodgy countries, but nothing beats what you will be told on
the ground. The locals will know whether it is safe. Ask. Don't take
places at face value. Don't confuse how somewhere looks in daylight with
how it will be at night.
* Don't penny-pinch. Take enough money, or other means of payment --
credit cards are a great boon -- to see you through.
* Respect a country's traditions. You don't have to bare your all to
keep cool, after all.
* Don't get drunk or take sweets from strangers, never make rude
remarks about the local dictator, and lay a paper trail if you are
heading into the unknown -- that means sending postcards regularly so
that someone somewhere knows where you were at a given time should your
movements ever have to be traced.

What do Scottish youth hostels have to offer parents of the
five-to-eight age range? What do the children like or dislike? Sarah
Nelson has some preconceptions overturned.
ADMIT it, grizzled midlife hillwalkers. How often, like me, have you
muttered furiously as school parties hogged the toaster for hours or
pushed past your nose with pans full of overpowering sausages: ''These
youth hostels would be OK if they'd only keep young people out''? Some
proprietorial, wrinkled veterans almost look annoyed at meeting anyone
who wasn't on their first hike at Loch Ossian or Ratagan in 1938.
Now, tables turn on me with a vengeance. As a single parent, sighing
with relief at an end to pricey B &amp; Bs, I signed my daughter up to the
SYHA the day after her fifth birthday. Since last March we've inflicted
our deadly duet on innocent wardens and hostellers across the country as
she trampolines on bunks, floods the showers, and exhausts the Coca-Cola
supply.
What do Scottish youth hostels have to offer parents of the
five-to-eight age range, before children grow serious and sensible, and
before they can take part in most SYHA adventure courses? What do the
children like or dislike? I've already had some preconceptions
overturned.
Unless you've drilled your brood from infancy to ghastly primitive
doings in tents, don't assume they will adore spartan conditions and
freezing pump water. Today's pampered kids demand their creature
comforts, downies, sweet-stocked store, and central heating. Rowan spent
most of her time addictively hogging the Coke machines at Pitlochry and
ultra-posh Stirling. This means you're wise to forgo ideas of an
ultra-cheap weekend and pick a good share of Grade Ones at #14-odd
minimum per night for two, even though many adults shrink from their
often more clinical atmosphere and hordes of foreign tourists . . . so
avoid with sense the high season, but since as so often the secret of
contentment is other kids to play with, try to avoid times of
guaranteed, splendid isolation too.
In contrast, though, my five-year-old took to some chores with vast,
unexpected enthusiasm, like cooking, putting away dishes, making up
beds, doing jobs, and deliciously fearing authority figures (the
wardens). Children actually love the rules that have driven some adults
away from youth hostels. So risk self-catering rather than cafeterias
(ripe for bad behaviour) and never let on, wardens or parents, that
they've abolished jobs in Grade Ones; Rowan tells the whole hostel that
naughty children have to clean the loos and she was starstruck with the
feather-duster cleverly whipped out for her at Melrose.
As a delinquent, she behaved better fascinated by a dormitory shared
with German or Italian girls than in a room on our own; another
assumption dashed, though of course many families will still be most
attracted by youth hostels' growing use of ''family rooms''. More than
30 SYHA hostels now offer these if you book in advance -- a dent in the
traditional image of monk-like sex segregations -- and now you don't
need a minimum booking of two adults and two children, which used to be
a problem for single parents.
The SYHA rashly invited us to picturesque Melrose for our in-depth
study of hostelling weekends with small brats. This is a very good
choice if you live in central or southern Scotland, because the place
you pick is as important as the hostel -- especially if your child isn't
ready to be satisfied just tramping the mountains. At the same time the
town's attractions are interesting enough to avoid suffocation or lunacy
among the adults.
We wandered the wonders of the Motor Museum and tiny teddy-bear
museums, swam in Galashiels pool, explored the abbey ruins, and dove to
Harestanes visitors' centre near Jedburgh, with its roomful of baffling
wooden games.
Colin and Janice Christison, wardens of the rambling 86-bed mansion at
Priorwood, don't just lay on excellent meals, they have that mix of
laid-back calmness and sense of being in control that children respond
to best. (It's not all glowing, changed days everywhere, though: there
are still a few wardens with a mania for sticking up notices and
enforcing daft rules like not washing your clothes.) Their children were
even tolerant enough to play football with small people and lend them
their soldier alarm-clock in an emergency. Melrose has the space and
atmosphere of many Grade Twos (the best in my book) with top-grade
facilities, what more could one ask?
Colin and Janice see all kinds of people and groups, of all ages, for
all activities: but in their view it's utopian to think these can all
mix gloriously together. Some people go to get away from kids. ''People
find their own levels and choose their own times,'' says Colin. ''We're
fortunate here, in that we have the space to accommodate that, and
aren't under such pressure as many of the busiest hostels.''
I'm sure that realistic view is right, and also that badly behaved
brats are as much a pain at youth hostels as anywhere else. Just because
SYHA hostels and their clientele vary so much, it's important to choose
times and places carefully for the most successful break. The
headquarters office is very helpful in giving parents advice, especially
about special events, and it's also useful to scout hostels and wardens
out on your own -- which, if your prejudices are rooted in 1967, is now
almost invariably a happy surprise.

THE political squall which hit South Africa's Government, and its
stock market, died yesterday almost as fast as it had blown up earlier
in the week. Relations between the two major groupings in the Government
-- the African National Congress and the National Party -- have been
repaired, at least temporarily; and the Johannesburg stock market has
recovered its poise and part of its value. The benefits of the
understanding and personal accord between Messrs Mandela and de Klerk
continue to be obvious during an inevitable period of transition. The
miracle of South Africa's relatively easy move to majority rule should
not allow complacency to develop: centuries of racial conflict and
distrust cannot be dissolved overnight. This incident is an abrupt
reminder of the continuing tensions between the two main racial groups
whose polarity was re-emphasised by the outcome of the first free (and
colour blind) elections in the country's history, though the Cape folk,
better known outside South Africa as the Cape coloureds, voted strongly
for the National Party and not the ANC.
It will take a long time before the black-white identities will
dissolve politically. It will still be tempting for black leaders to
play the colour card, and even if they were to be more restrained, the
main economic division in the country will remain along racial lines and
must therefore involve whites in being objects of envy as well as higher
payers of taxes on income. One of Mr Mandela's attractions is that, in
spite of his personal history, he sees beyond these matters to a common
future for his country, as does Mr de Klerk. They have therefore defused
a dangerous situation by agreeing to apply to members of the police and
the Army (and two former Afrikaner Ministers responsible for these
bodies) immunity from prosecution for real and alleged criminal
behaviour during the apartheid years. Immunity had already been granted
to former ANC guerrilla fighters and indeed it had been assumed that
this was automatically extended across the racial divide. That
extension, which was thrown into doubt by the events of the week, is now
confirmed. It is better that it is: the savage war, which Mr Mandela's
release from imprisonment brought to an end, can only be exorcised by
forgiving and forgetting.
It is not just a matter of practical politics. Keeping the main racial
groups operating in tandem is an economic matter as well. South Africa
is uniquely placed to make its people prosper in spite of the upsets of
political transition, but it cannot generate by itself the capital it
needs. It can easily import that capital, but only as long as it remains
politically stable. This brouhaha threatened that stability, and it may
still prove damaging; but it does look as if the damage has been
contained.

William Russell describes the Brazil experience in all its beautiful
and spectacular detail with advice on where to go and how much to pay.
THE first thing to get straight is that Brazil is more than just Rio
de Janeiro, and Rio de Janeiro is more than just the the Sugarloaf, the
concrete Christ on Corcovado, or latter-day Carmen Mirandas dressed like
fur-coated Edinburgh ladies misbehaving themselves with their President
at Carnival. (The last President, that is, because Enrique Cardoso had
nothing to do with it.)
It is the sixth largest country in the world. Its high inflation is
now being tackled by the introduction of a new currency, the Real.
President Cardoso's tough policies, introduced when he was finance
minister, coupled with the country's vast natural resources, may help to
resolve the terrifying extremes of poverty and wealth which confront the
visitor and bedevil the country. It is also a country of infinite
variety, having virtually every kind of scenery and climate, and a
population made up of people from every corner of the world.
Admittedly Brazil is a long way off. Maybe you will go there only once
in your life, although it is a very more-ish country. Maybe you should,
therefore, pack in as much as you can into one holiday. But until Brazil
gets her economy straight the ball remains in your court, although it
does help if our own economy and the pound/dollar rate are doing well
also.
What you lose on the swings of a costly air fare -- costly compared to
air fares to the United States, that is -- you gain on the roundabouts
of a lower cost of living. A London-Rio return air ticket is about #500,
while a three-star Rio hotel works out at about 50 dollars (around #30)
a night bed and breakfast, pretty good going anywhere in Europe and
inconceivable in London. A good dinner could be anything from 10 to 15
dollars, portion control is unknown, while the really frugal could exist
on a Brazilian breakfast alone.
The second thing to get straight is the importance of consulting a
specialist travel agent, somebody like Journey Latin America or Explore,
not just the man on the corner. The specialists will offer
round-the-country tours based on the Brazil airpass, which allows cheap
air travel internally, should you decide to do as much as you can in one
go because tickets bought in Brazil are dear. But, should you opt for
doing just one region, using the excellent bus network to travel from
wherever you have chosen as your base, they will help you plan that too.
The third thing is that the reputation for being a dangerous country,
while never to be ignored, can be overstated. There is street violence,
tourists do get mugged, pockets picked, handbags snatched, but simple
common sense -- take what you need, use the hotel safe -- should get you
through unscathed. Don't venture, however, into the shanty towns, even
when they look picturesque.
The fourth thing is take a good guidebook. For my money there is none
better than the South American Handbook, but there are others published
by Frommer and Lonely Planet which are useful.
Rio is probably the beginning of any Brazil experience. The city lives
up to its reputation for beauty. Guanabara bay, the Sugarloaf, Corcovado
with the Christ towering over a sheer drop to the lagoon below, arms
spread blessing the city, and the windy, sunbaked glories of Copacabana
beach are everything you ever imagined. Some cities are smaller,
dirtier, uglier than one expects. Rio exceeds expectations. It is noisy,
the buses are a nightmare, although at a flat rate of 35 cents very
cheap to use, and it is crowded. But it also throbs with vitality and is
incredibly beautiful.
It is also easy to escape from. Copacabana may be the legend, but take
the ferry to Niteroi across the bay -- again a mere 35 cents -- and a
40-minute trip on a No 38 bus -- 55 cents -- to the Atlantic beaches of
Itaipu and Itacoatiara and you are in another world, a quiet land of
fishing boats and rustic seaside bars with spectacular views of Rio.
Do not fear, Sao Paulo although it has a dreadful reputation. A maze
of skyscrapers and freeways, it is one of the wonders of the world, a
city which grew up out of nowhere. There are good restaurants, theatres,
night-clubs, beer-halls, cafes, and cinemas, and an underground system
which allows you to travel easily round the centre of the city. As for
that reputation -- it is deserved, but common sense will ensure you have
few, if any, problems and the authorities have the situation far more
under control than a few years ago. Outside at Santos lies a seaside
resort of great beauty and calm, just an hour or so away by bus, and
inland are some beautiful mountain resorts to rival anything in
Switzerland only a couple of hours away.
Like Rio, Sao Paulo is a good starting point. You can take the bus
overland overnight to Iguacu and its astonishing falls, go down the
coast to Curitiba, a completely Italian city, from which you can take a
train and travel through spectacular mountain gorges to Paranagua on the
coast, a tropical paradise. From Rio you could visit Petropolis -- a day
trip by bus -- and see the palace of the last Emperor which looks as if
the Brazilian royals had just walked out into the garden for a breath of
air.
With an airpass it is possible to go further, to Manaus on the Amazon,
with its famous opera house, to Santerem halfway down-river, to Belem at
its mouth, to Fortalezza with its famous beaches further down the coast,
to Recife and Olinda.
One of the best things about Brazilian hotels are their breakfasts.
Lucullus would approve. Fresh fruits of every imaginable kind, yoghurts,
curds, scrambled egg, bacon, cakes, puddings, jellies, rolls, cheeses,
and ham will all be on show, and nobody minds how much you eat. As for
restaurants, every dish is large enough to include a second helping. The
food is also to our taste, being Mediterranean in origin. And if
McDonald's is your thing, they are there too.
The beer (chop) is good, the wines reasonable, and the local drink,
kachassa, a white vodka-like spirit (with fresh lime juice and sugar it
becomes a caiparinha) is a lethal potion to be remembered. In my case,
it would be more accurate to say forgotten. This year I set out for the
evening, had a couple of caiparinhas, decided to eat in the adjoining
restaurant, and had some rich red wine with dinner. I still don't know
how I managed to leave my hotel at 7pm in white trousers and return to
it in navy-blue ones at 3am. Both pairs were mine.
One last word. On a budget of 70/80 dollars a day you will not go
wrong, and you won't be slumming it. Work it out. Europe can be far
dearer than that.

David Wishart experiences the contrasting worlds of an energetic
country where tourism is taking off and everybody wants the Yankee
dollar.
IT IS an elementary law of travel that cities on the water should be
approached by ship, and that is how we came to Saigon, which is what
everyone seems to call it rather than the commissars' choice of Ho Chi
Minh City. But it was a bewildering experience, for in the space of
three hours our ship, the Pearl, went from the South China Sea into a
winding river bordered by jungle and paddy fields and docked a rickshaw
ride from one of Asia's best restaurant rows.
The pedal-powered rickshaw known as a cyclo gave me an unhurried look
at Saigon, whose streets are a clutter of traffic but thankfully
relatively fairly free of cars, although some are head-turners -- such
as a well-preserved Citroen Light 15, long the getaway car of choice of
French gangsters. All streets seem to lead to Dong Khoi, formerly Rue
Catinat and still a good place to eat. Rue Catinat saw many a sight,
including the departing parade of the French Foreign Legionnaires who
defiantly sang Je Ne Regrette Rien.
The French left behind a handsome heritage of ochre-coloured buildings
including the wedding cake City Hall, formerly known as Hotel de Ville,
and the Hotel Continental, where Somerset Maugham stayed and Graham
Greene worked on The Quiet American. These days the US trade embargo has
been lifted and there is even talk of Washington getting back the
embassy it departed in a panic in 1975.
But this energetic country of 73 million has already received
considerable foreign investment from Asian countries led by Japan and
Korea as well as France and Britain and is poised to be the next Asian
tiger. Tourism is taking off, hotels and golf courses are under
construction, and everybody wants the Yankee dollar. On a tour bus the
guide is asked about the communist government in Hanoi and he shrugs off
the question as might a stockbroker in Shanghai.
It doesn't matter, he says, about communism, capitalism, or any other
''ism'', the fact is the Vietnamese want the prosperity of Singapore and
Hong Kong that they see daily on their smuggled TVs, and in the meantime
one benefit of a hard-line regime, as those who remember Spain before
and after Franco, is that there is little crime.
In the old Chinese quarter of Cholon, once a Suzie Wong world of
girlie bars and opium dens, we stop at a pagoda and are besieged by
vendors selling postcards and T-shirts. A year ago there was one man
with crudely printed Good Morning Vietnam shirts. The pagoda doors swing
closed behind us and we are in another world, quiet, the air scented
with incense. It was like this in the beginning.
Our introduction to Vietnam was through a morning mist as the Pearl
entered Ha Long Bay after a day at sea from Hong Kong. I woke and looked
out of my cabin window to see a jagged finger of rock slicing out of the
ocean like a sentinel. By the time I got on deck there were more of
these astonishing rocks, many more, and from the bow of the Pearl it
seemed as if we were sailing into a giant aquatic theme park.
Mythology says this unique water terrain was created by a dragon
coming from his home in the mountains. On the journey his thrashing tail
gouged valleys which filled with water when he reached the ocean,
leaving just peaks poking above the surface.
In the haze of the morning the scene was like a Chinese ink painting,
or perhaps a silent movie, for the picture changed slowly as the vessel
navigated a narrow channel. Later the Pearl would anchor in a bay amid a
motley collection of rusty freighters and we would take an equally
dilapidated excursion boat for a closer look at the rock formations and
to hear of Tarasque, a mysterious sea serpent which local fishermen say
haunts Ha Long Bay. An inscrutable cousin, one imagines, of the Loch
Ness monster.
Along the way tourists have to take Vietnam in their stride, for the
excursion boat's decking was patched with concrete and the beer warm,
but cruise-ship passengers have it easy compared with those who have to
endure the country's primitive roads and a rail system crying out for a
Mussolini.
The Pearl turned out to be a floating oasis that took 450 passengers
in great comfort from one end of the country to another, and being a
small ship with a reputation for exploratory voyages, does not appeal to
the normal cruise-ship passenger. Being a French ship, it does have very
good food, and not a few French passengers, but there were also a good
number from Britain, and the small but lively band of on-board
entertainers were all British.
Being pioneers can have its inconveniences, such as the Pearl running
aground in the harbour entrance to Danang, albeit with three pilots on
the bridge. But no problem for the adventurous passengers on the Pearl.
We simply hopped on to a rusty tug and left the captain to wait for the
afternoon tide. Presumably he would pass the time throttling the pilots.
At the Danang dock there was an emotional welcome from a group of
children who pressed roses into the hands of passengers including Terry
Anderson, the American reporter who was a Marine here before spending
seven years captive in Lebanon. Anderson was on board with a small group
promoting trade links with Vietnam. About a third of the passengers were
American, including an ex-Navy pilot who spent five years in the Hanoi
Hilton after his F8 Crusader was shot down.
Danang had its hour of infamy in 1975 when the Saigon government
abandoned Danang and its own army turned into a rabble. Two truckloads
of Viet Cong, half of them women, drove into what had been the most
heavily defended city in South Vietnam and, without firing a shot,
declared Danang liberated. At about the same time South Vietnamese
soldiers were shooting one another as well as civilians at the airport
as 1000 people rushed two World Airways Boeing 727s.
In scenes shown world-wide on TV panicking people mobbed the rear door
of one, climbed into the wheel wells, and someone threw a hand-grenade
at the plane, damaging the right wing. Several stowaways couldn't hold
on, and as the plane flew southward TV cameras on the other 727 filmed
them falling into the South China Sea.
Our flight from Danang to Hanoi in a Russian TU-134 lacked the
melodrama and even got there on time. At the airport the guide turned
out to be a charming law student in a traditional flowing ao-dai. She
spoke good English, and was able to tell us that the city's language
university, which used to teach nothing but Russian, now concentrates on
English because it is the best language for dealing with the growing
number of business-people and tourists arriving in Vietnam. French, once
the language of government and the intelligentsia, has been relegated to
fading street-signs and gravestones of legionnaires. In a land where
most people make #30 to #100 a month, teachers of English earn #150.
Hanoi is a city of bicycles and cyclos, plus a growing number of
mopeds, which clog the narrow streets lined with shophouses and
sidewalks seething with people. There are streets which sell just silk,
or hardware, or TV sets smuggled from Singapore, but no matter which you
choose it seems as if all 925,000 Hanoi inhabitants are on it at the
same time.
The melange of handsome old ochre-coloured buildings with tile roofs
from the French colonial period, the tropical greenery, and the dusty
streets with cyclo drivers in conical hats makes for a staggeringly
attractive atmosphere. It may not last once tourism and a developing
economy get hold and already old buildings are coming down for office
buildings and flash homes for the new rich.
In the meantime the living is cheap for tourists. There are hotel
rooms for #20 a night and young travellers pay just #2 at the Darling
Hanoi guest-house. Food runs at about #3 a day, three large bottles of
beer cost a pound, and there are cheap excursions to places such as Ha
Long Bay.
Some say backpackers have more fun, but good travel experiences come
to those who travel in small groups and are flexible. For example, our
minibus made an unscheduled stop at the Army Museum, where a MiG-21
fighter sits triumphantly on a pedestal with broken B-52s in the
background. We stopped for a photo, then turned when our guide yelled at
a 76-year-old leader-writer from Texas who was running across a busy
road towards a statue of Lenin (an increasingly rare sight these days).
He had spotted a number of soldiers who had been at a parade nearby
and wanted them in a photo with Lenin. So he indicated to them to line
up in front of the statue, which they not only did but waved and
cheered, and we could see he was getting a great shot. So another two of
us braved the traffic, as well as the yells of our guide who was seeing
her timetable going to hell, and we had the shot of the day.
Lunch was at a functional Cuban-built hotel where guests watched golf
on the lobby TV, shoppers reported great bargains in silk and CDs at a
pound each, haircuts were next to nothing at any crossroads open-air
barber shop, but the man who had a story to tell was the ex-Navy pilot
who went back to the Hanoi Hilton and found it empty. He was not only
able to push the front door open but when he walked around the side
workmen had just that very day made a breach in the wall. The site will
contain -- what else? -- a hotel.
The Pearl was docked in Danang for three days, allowing for a variety
of shore excursions to places such as Hue, capital for 150 years under
13 emperors, and Hoi An, a sleepy riverside town which rivalled Macao
and Malacca in the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries and still
offers a fascinating collection of fine old buildings crowding over
narrow streets. Women in conical hats arrive by sampan, which they row
with the elegance of a dance step.
One young girl arrived with six ducks tied to the handlebars and
hanging upside down. We were feeling very sorry for the ducks, who were
quacking plaintively, until a Frenchman said: ''Wait till you see the
dogs.'' In Vietnam, anything can go into the pot including snakes, bats,
rats, lizards, monkeys, and eels.
A night and a morning at sea found us in the handsome bay of Nha
Trang, where another emotional welcome waited on the dock. Three dozen
young women in white ao-dais and conical hats smiled and waved
carnations, while a drum-and-bugle band of schoolchildren competed with
firecrackers. Minutes later we were on a nearby beach where young women
offered massages for $5, Bali-style. Club Med is planning a village on
this beautiful beach.
Then Saigon, almost 50 miles from the sea by a wide and twisting river
bordered by jungle swamps for most of the way. The shipping is a mixture
of local motorised sampans, each vessel with serpents' eyes on the bow,
grubby coasters, and sleek container ships. Activity begins to pick up
on the west side with repair yards, then docks, and finally the city,
while the other bank is a seedy jumble of shacks on stilts, like a
favela of Rio.
A crush of cyclo drivers awaits at the dock gates and few passengers
can resist going by the US Embassy and peering up to the helicopter pad
which was the springboard for the final American evacuation to the 7th
Fleet. We also go by Saigon's History Museum, which has a fair amount of
American military hardware, while the War Crimes Museum displays graphic
pictures of American atrocities against the Viet Cong. No mention is
made of the Viet Cong's ill-treatment of its enemies. In the courtyard,
amid a collection of rusting American guns and tanks, stands a
guillotine.
Outside are the T-shirt vendors, whose only interest in the war is to
unload Good Morning Vietnam shirts at $2 a time. For them the war
belongs in the museums, and the Americans on the ship felt much the same
way. There were many veterans on board, some who had been brutally
treated in captivity, but the war did not dominate the voyage, as I was
afraid it might.
At the same time few on board were without a copy of war correspondent
Hugh Mulligan's book The Agony of Vietnam, a fine piece of work with
some great lines, such as the Saigon nightclub singer's ''Led Loses for
a Brue Rady''.
Today Saigon is recovering some of the flair of its past and the
authorities are fighting a losing battle not only for their choice of
name, but for the dong, the currency they want tourists to use. Instead
tourists flourish dollars and make jokes about the other.
Business travellers and tourists are paying $100 and up at the better
hotels, while the Rex, famous for its rooftop terrace, stings customers
$20 for two drinks. We gave that a miss in favour of the rundown but fun
Apocalypse Now Bar, which just happens to be across the street from the
Hard Rock Cafe.
New hotels and office towers are going up fast, which spells doom for
the already-crumbling French colonial architecture. In the meantime it
is not hard to find a restaurant whose courtyard has ochre-coloured
walls and fairy lights and inexpensive food, and where you can look at
the door and imagine the legionnaires going by, singing Edith Piaf's
anthem.
January to March are the best times to go for weather. Pearl will be
making similar Vietnam cruises on March 13 and June 20. The cruises
begin in Hong Kong and end in Singapore, or vice versa, with one or two
nights at both destinations.

TONIGHT old Camperdown and I will be embarking upon a trip down memory
lane when we return once again to Marchmont House at Greenlaw, a village
near Duns, for the Berwickshire Hunt Ball, organised by Lady Palmer.
Always one of Scotland's most glamorous occasions, it was never more so
than when it was held at Marchmont in those long ago days when the
McEwen family were in residence.
Although I was just a young slip of a thing, I vividly remember the
excitement of seeing Princess Margaret for the first time, not to
mention Terence Stamp, the actor with those piercing blue eyes. We all
thought the McEwen brothers terribly good-looking then, very exciting
and modern; a glimpse of sophisticated sixties' London nightlife on the
very edge of the Lammermuir Hills.
Marchmont House was built in the mid-eighteenth century by John and
Robert Adam from designs drawn up by William, their father. The McEwen
family, of course, derived their fortune from beer, but Sir John McEwen,
first baronet of Marchmont, reaped the benefits and married a niece of
the 13th Lord Lovat.
Sir John sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Berwick and
Haddington for 14 years, and was, for a time, Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. For a year he was even Chairman
of the House of Commons 1922 Committee.
That was in an age when people stood for Parliament out of conviction,
having made money. Nowadays, according to Camperdown, ''virtually
everybody in politics is on the make''.
Of Sir John's six sons, two -- Rory and Alex -- became rather famous
as folk singers back in the 1950s. Rory was also rather artistically
gifted and painted flowers; Alex went on to become a newsagent
executive, working for their near neighbour, John Menzies.
Their older brother, Sir Robin, once stood against Sir David Steel
when he contested Roxburgh, Selkirk, and Peeblesshire for the Liberals,
and with John Sebastian, the youngest brother, did some of the
black-and-white illustrations for Ring of Bright Water -- that wonderful
book about otters in the West Highlands, written by their friend Mr
Gavin Maxwell.
Christian, Sir John's only daughter, married the second Lord Hesketh
and, last heard of, was collaborating with that nice former editor chap,
Mr Magnus Linklater, on a book about either Charles I or II, one forgets
which.
Nowadays Marchmont House has been taken over by the Sue Ryder
Foundation and is a residential home complete with matron and nursing
staff. I was wondering what on earth they would do with the patients on
the night of the ball, but I'm assured all of them will be cosily tucked
up in their beds and we will only have access to part of the house, the
main living room and that incredibly long passage which leads to the
great ballroom where the dancing will take place.
* YET another centenary celebration, this time the bicentenary of the
building of James Craig's New Town of Edinburgh. Next weekend, in
Edinburgh's Assembly Rooms in George Street, which date, I believe, from
1787, a Burns' Supper and Rout is to take place in the presence of the
Rt Hon Norman and Anne Irons, the city's Lord and Lady Provost.
The Master of Ceremonies will be Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, scion of a
distinguished Scottish legal dynasty, and prior to a traditional toast
to the Bard being delivered by the Rev Andrew McLellan, the haggis will
be piped in by Hugh Grey Cheape.
Hugh is that talented young chap who works for the Royal Museum of
Scotland and writes fascinatingly authoritative books on tartan, even if
he does insist on wearing his Scottish Gas kilt on such occasions.
Robert Burns, indeed, read many of his own poems in these very rooms
and should he be looking on he might be a trifle puzzled to see Iain
Brown of the National Library of Scotland declaiming him on such an
occasion.
Guests are invited to wear eighteenth-century costumes and there will
be demonstrations of Scottish dancing from the Edinburgh Early Dancers.
Camperdown suspects this is all part and parcel of Edinburgh's
campaign to get back at Glasgow for being appointed City of Architecture
and Design 1999.
* A DIARY date for February 2 -- Moira Shearer, who all those years
ago thrilled me into taking ballet lessons when I saw her dancing in The
Red Shoes, that film produced by Michael Powell, is to unveil a
stained-glass window for the Abbot House in Dunfermline.
I have to admit I had forgotten she was born in Dunfermline, and it
should prove a fascinating homecoming for her, especially when she sees
what the Dunfermline Heritage Trust, under the chairmanship of Margaret
Deans, has achieved.
It seems ages since I have seen Moira, or Lady Kennedy as one should
call her now since her husband, Ludovic Kennedy, the writer, was
knighted last year. They had the most wonderfully pretty house over the
Dean Bridge in Edinburgh, but I always felt they left for London in a
bit of a huff when he was not only turned down for membership of the New
Club and Muirfield, but failed to be elected rector of Edinburgh
University.

SO YOU reckon the stormy waters currently being negotiated by our
royal family are something special, out of the ordinary? Don't you
believe it. The only difference is that a thousand years ago royal feuds
were fought out at knifepoint, but today they seem to be conducted in
newspaper columns, TV documentaries, and at the end of a telephoto lens.
What doesn't seem to have changed much is that the good of the nation
is not, I fear, always a prime consideration.
You'll recall that last week we were having a wee spin around the year
1820. We looked at the so-called Radical Revolt, now let's turn to the
tale of Queen Caroline's persecution. This remarkable affair -- which
amounted to the trial of a queen for adultery -- really caught the
imagination of the Scottish public.
Caroline, second daughter of the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel, was
the wife of George IV. She married him in 1795 while he was still Prince
of Wales but, according to the biographers, the union ''quickly became
disagreeable to the prince''.
While she lived separately from George at Blackheath in London reports
''to her discredit'' began to circulate. An inquiry by a ministerial
committee in 1806, however, found her behaviour imprudent but not
criminal. Already public opinion ran strongly in her favour and it
appeared for a time that she had been welcomed back into the royal fold.
But in 1813 the slanging match resumed in earnest, the queen
complaining about being denied access to her daughter. It was, however,
a lengthy continental tour in the company of an Italian gentleman called
Bergami, her ''confidant and attendant'', that got the rumour machine
into top gear.
When George came to the throne in 1820 her name was struck out of the
royal prayer which formed part of the church service and the king
indicated that he would offer an income of #50,000 if she was prepared
to take another title rather than queen.
She refused and arrived at Dover on June 5 indicating she was ready
for a scrap. One historian describes the feeling in the country: ''The
heart of the people, especially of the lower orders, was strongly on her
side both because she was a woman and believed to be a persecuted woman
and also because her husband was notorious for his profligacy.''
A month later a Bill of Pains and Penalties accusing Caroline of
''licentious behaviour'', seeking to deprive her of her title, rights,
and privileges and proposing the dissolution of her marriage, was
introduced in the House of Lords.
Witnesses were called on both sides but although Caroline appeared to
have been a lady who enjoyed life to the full no conclusive evidence of
misconduct was offered. Such was the popular support for Caroline that
the Bill was abandoned later in the year.
A fascinating footnote to this almost-forgotten scandal was that on
July 19, 1821, at Westminster Abbey the bold Caroline, although banished
from court, turned up and demanded admittance to her husband's
coronation. She was turned away at the door. Boy, wouldn't the tabloids
have had a field day?

SCOTTISH council leaders yesterday failed to wring any concessions
from Scottish Secretary Ian Lang over Government funding for next year,
despite their warning of job losses, service cutbacks, and big
council-tax rises.
At a meeting in Edinburgh, Mr Lang told representatives of the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that there would be no change
to the tough, below inflation level financial settlement for 1995-96
announced before Christmas.
Speaking after the meeting, he dismissed the councillors' warnings of
a financial crisis, saying he had heard the same claims year after year.
''I don't agree with the figures they are claiming. I don't
acknowledge the figures,'' he said.
Neither was there any excuse for substantial council-tax rises, said
Mr Lang. Local authorities had to look for economies and more efficient
ways of delivering services and not expect taxpayers to keep providing
extra resources.
Mr Lang said he accepted it was a tight settlement but if councils had
been running an efficient organisation during the current year and
making the same economies as the private sector they would be able to
accommodate the pressures on them next year.
Both he and Scottish Local Government Minister Allan Stewart stressed
that council staff levels had risen in Scotland at a time when English
authorities were making cutbacks.
In addition, spending levels for Scottish councils were 45% higher
than for their English counterparts.
Mr Lang brushed aside a letter sent by a senior civil servant to
Strathclyde, which angered some councillors as it seemed to pre-empt the
meeting by saying there was no scope for change.
He said it was a statement of fact and the question of tone was one of
interpretation.
Cosla's Labour president, Councillor Rosemary McKenna, repeated the
convention's claim that local government was facing ''a very serious
situation'' as a result of the worst financial settlement for 20 years.
She said it had been a ''depressing'' meeting because Mr Lang either
wasn't listening or refused to listen to their case.
They had argued for some financial acknowledgement by the Government
of the staff wage settlements councils had to pay, and for some easing
of the capping levels which would give councils more freedom to set
their budgets.
Cosla vice-president, Councillor Keith Geddes, warned that education
services would be worst hit by cutbacks, and it was also stressed that
redundancies had to be paid for and did not offer a quick financial fix
for councils.

THE rhetoric surrounding the disagreement over the funding of BBC
Scotland drama productions is of a high order. This is only to be
expected given the participants, but eloquence can be used to confuse as
well as to clarify and it is time that facts replaced faction. At the
moment two large drama productions proposed by BBC Scotland have been
cancelled by BBC management in London. The artistic integrity of the
productions appears to be beyond question. Money, then, is at the root
of an argument which many thought to have been settled last year when Mr
John Birt insisted that one of his chief desires was to enable and
ensure that an increasing number of BBC Scotland productions were shown
nationwide. Mr Birt's commitment startled his audience. He admitted that
too many programmes were made in London and said that changes in the way
productions were commissioned and produced would ensure that more could
be made outside London. This was followed by promises that Scotland
would have significantly increased funds for drama production.
The relationship of money to the arts has always been difficult. Like
tectonic plates, they can rub along reasonably well for years, then a
sticking-point produces an earthquake into which both money and artistic
production can disappear. Nevertheless, money is obviously necessary for
any television drama and if the artistic quality of the scripts and
proposals currently being argued over is acceptable, the issue of
funding becomes paramount. At this point the BBC in Scotland appears to
be at a considerable disadvantage. There has been increasing evidence of
centralising trends within the BBC nationally. These have drawn more
power and influence to London. Those involved in London will tell a
different story, but in the case of the present dispute the proof would
appear to be the need for Scottish staff to gain approval from London
headquarters for any sizeable production.
It is not stretching the argument too far to say that this situation
contains echoes of the Rolls-Royce affair, and the general dismay
incurred by Scotland's position as the outer limb of too many
centralised organisations. As a method of encouraging Scottish (we
refuse to use the word regional) drama production of quality it is
laughable. It is not just the writers and producers who are dismayed by
long-distance decision-making. Technicians, cameramen, set designers,
and a whole host of other trades and professions need to be involved in
prestigious work if their talents are to be used and, more importantly,
retained in Scotland. The solution is to provide BBC Scotland with
sufficient funding to produce quality work. This should be accompanied
by total control, from commissioning through to production. If the
result is good the trust will have been justified. If it is not, the
product will be rejected and lessons will have been learned. That is
what we expected from Mr Birt. Anything else is unacceptable.

The specialities of independent tour operators can be hard to find --
and resist. Julie Davidson declares a weakness.
TIS the season of armchair travel. Brochures plop voluptuously through
the letter box, and we gorge on dreams. I have a special weakness for
the specialities of independent tour operators -- the ones whose wares
are hard to find among the catch-all, beach-besotted bumf of the
industry's high-street supermarkets -- and can't resist their classified
ads with those diffident invitations to dial-a-brochure for Vacanze in
Italia . . . Inntravel's walks and horseback rides . . . Time Off's
classy French Selection.
* I DECLARE an interest in a newcomer to this delicious range: Simply
Tuscany and Umbria, from the Simply Travel people who bring you Simply
Corsica, Simply Crete (last year's winner of the Observer Travel Company
of the Year) and other exercises in niche simplicity. Their new
programme has been put together by an auld acquaintance, Jennifer Paton,
one-time marketing director of The Magic of Italy and a woman whose
judgment on destinations Italian I've learned to trust over several
paid-up family holidays and one or two press freebies.
The market for self-catering villas and beguiling hotels in Tuscany is
a competitive one -- is there a single old farmhouse left unconverted?
-- and coastless Umbria, ''the green heart of Italy'', is going the same
way. The centrepiece of Simply T and U, however, looks particularly
seductive: Vallicorte, which may be yet another ''glorious old
farmhouse'' but which offers more than swimming-pool and views on its
leafy hill north of Lucca. The owners run special-interest holidays
during the spring and autumn months: language and cookery, watercolour
painting, Apuan walks, and art and architecture. Dial-a-brochure on 018
995 8277.
* JENNY Paton it was who first told me the food in Sicily was among
the best in Italy. That was some years ago, but it was only last summer
I finally got round to consumer-testing this claim; and while the soul
pines for the view from the terrace of the Ristorante del Duomo in
Taormina the body craves its antipasti table and its pepata di cozze,
the most inventively spiced mussels I've ever tasted.
What puts Sicilian food in a class of its own? There are two official
explanations: the island's fruit and vegetables are superlative (want to
know 100 things to do with aubergines?) and its tenth-century history of
Arab occupation introduced a taste for spices and distilled flavourings.
But it's my personal theory that its culinary excellence has been
protected by the demanding palates of its own people, and of the
mainland Italians who are its chief summer visitors. Let in the British
and they'll soon be serving spaghetti alla carbonara made with cream.
* THE British, of course, have dribbled into Sicily in small,
relic-seeking numbers, Swan Hellenic types, but for all its 1000
kilometres of coastline the Mediterranean's largest island hasn't done
much to promote its resorts as family holiday destinations. This
exasperates another Jenny I know: Jenny Owens from Airdrie, now Signora
Fichera of Taormina, whom we found presiding over Bella Blu, a
restaurant, pizzeria, and leading nightspot which hangs over the edge of
this heavenly clifftop town 700ft above the sea. Jenny maintains
interests in the travel industry where she worked before marrying into a
Sicilian family, and she feels the island could do more to blow its own
trumpet.
When we return to Taormina, as we certainly intend to do, I shall be
happy to tell her that some eloquent blasts have at last been performed
for the British market by the region's tourist authorities, whose new
promotional brochure is a little masterpiece of its kind. Sicily: a
Journey through Time and Beauty combines clearly presented data on the
island and its provinces with well-written essays on its history,
culture, and star attractions. It also lists details of tour operators
who feature Sicily in their programmes, and is available from the
Italian State Tourist Office on 071-408 1254.
* FROM the sublime to the . . . homely. Grannie's Heilan' Hame, in
fact, which is the innocently awful name of the Dornoch Firth caravan
park run by Parkdean Holidays. This direct-sell operator has just
invested #1.7m in its two Scottish properties (the other is at Nairn)
and on-site facilities now include an indoor-pool complex at the Moray
Firth park, and tennis courts and ''soft-play'' room at the Dornoch one.
More information on 091 224 0500.
* ANOTHER of those daft surveys, conducted this time by Sky TV's
travel channel, offers the following information: only 10% of British
holidaymakers list sex as their favourite holiday activity. The rest
''would rather spend their time sightseeing and getting to know the
locals''. Does either of these pursuits necessarily preclude a bit of
the other?
* HAPPINESS is an ex-Scotland departure. CTC Cruise Lines have been so
encouraged by the uptake on their first sailing from Greenock this
summer that they've laid on another Clyde departure ''to coincide with
the October half-term holiday period''. The July cruise to the Canary
Islands on their 750-passenger flagship Southern Cross was fully booked
within two months of its introduction, and the waiting-list is still
long.
The Southern Cross is, therefore, returning to Greenock in the autumn
for a 13-night cruise to the Canaries and North Africa with a lead-in
price of #553. Another Southern Cross cruise (six nights from #284)
leaves from Leith for Norway's fiords in July, which means that CTC
expects to carry almost 3000 passengers from its Scottish sailings this
year. More information on 0171 896 8888.
* HERE'S a man I'd like to meet: Isadore Sharp, the Toronto-based
chairman and president of Four Seasons-Regent Hotels and Resorts. In my
cautious opinion and from my incomplete experience this international
hotel group is the best of its five-star kind -- remarkable as much for
the consistently high levels of smiling service it coaxes from catering
staff as traditionally surly as Londoners, and from receptionists as
traditionally snooty as Italians.
The Four Seasons supremo will be in London at the end of the month to
welcome Princess Alexandra to the silver anniversary party of his Park
Lane property, and if you have a spare #125 you, too, can be a guest at
this gala dinner, where profits will not be pocketed by Mr Shore's
shareholders but by the British Red Cross. All kinds of other events
have been planned for the hotel's 25th birthday, including a blend of
tea ''drawing on flavours from the four seasons of the year'' and
developed by Sam Twining (nice to know there's still a family member
behind the brand name) and a ''Silver Nights'' weekend package for those
who married in 1970, when the hotel was called the Inn on the Park, and
those who marry this year.
Unfortunately I didn't do/don't plan to do either. But those
qualifying can get more information on 071-499 0888, bearing in mind
that whatever the rate for the Silver Nights package it will cost rather
more than a fortnight's caravanning at Grannie's Heilan' Hame.

IT is difficult to know how one would react, being introduced to a new
solicitor, to find that he was wearing a light brown suit. It might be
so disconcerting that one would cancel the appointment immediately.
Solicitors wear either charcoal grey or navy blue suits, and any paler
shade would invite suspicions of frivolity, perhaps even the racetrack.
One recalls that Mr Ashraf Ali Bashiri, a highly respected London
solicitor, was once refused a hearing by Mr Geoffrey Breen, the
Horseferry Road stipendiary magistrate, for appearing before him in a
#200 sports jacket. Asked what he considered appropriate, Mr Breen
replied: ''A suit. Preferably dark in colour.''
That is probably why the legal profession is said to have great
admiration for the well-cut suits worn by John Thaw, who plays the lead
role in television's Kavanagh QC. There have even been approaches to him
personally, asking for the name of his tailor. How lawyers dress may not
be classed as a professional skill, but it is widely conceded that
despite being only an ''artificial silk'' -- an actor speaking the lines
of a QC -- Mr Thaw looks nearer the part than the real thing, even when
not in court. The subject is of particular interest this week following
a report that the arrival in London of American lawyers, ''with their
sharp suits, padded shoulders, and 'have a nice day' handshakes'', is
forcing their British counterparts to visit image consultants. An advice
session for male solicitors takes half a day, while their female
colleagues may need a full day. ''The locals need to place even greater
emphasis upon their presentation and perception and that includes
personal style, not just glamorous offices,'' says Mr Duncan Lamont, a
media solicitor with Biddle and Co.
Whether American lawyers will observe dress rules remains to be seen.
One of the hardest working was Clarence Darrow, who was often teased by
reporters for coming to court dishevelled. ''I go to a better tailor
than any of you, and pay more for my clothes,'' he replied. ''The only
difference is that you probably don't sleep in them.''

It had all the ingredients of a prestige dream-package -- but hopes
for a television film of award-winning novel Swing Hammer Swing have now
been finally dashed. This latest blow for home-produced drama underlines
the growing crisis at BBC Scotland, reveals ALASDAIR MARSHALL
THE announcement that BBC Scotland's major television film based on
the acclaimed novel of Gorbals life, Swing Hammer Swing, has been axed
surprised few insiders. The sword of Damocles had been poised over the
project for several months as Andrea Calderwood, Scottish head of drama,
made strenuous last-ditch efforts to raise the #1.6m budget in London.
But on Tuesday the word was out at Queen Margaret Drive. The amber light
for ''maybe'' flashed red instead of green. The BBC would not be
financing the film.
Swing Hammer Swing is not the only production to get the
chop-hatchet-chop treatment. Its demise is an echo of the death knell
that has sounded for other drama productions involving prestigious TV
writers. Although scripts have been commissioned and paid for, the works
are either in jeopardy or will not now be made in Scotland.
The fate of Swing Hammer Swing provides firepower for critics who
claim that there is a crisis at BBC Scotland, with home-produced drama
being allocated risible funding. It also strengthens the hand of those
who argue that Scotland is treated ''like a dirt-poor relation'' by the
BBC mandarins who allocate budgets for television drama north of the
Border and in other regions.
Many feel that regional drama departments no longer seem to have any
autonomous power within the BBC as all roads now lead to an increasingly
monolithic BBC Centre in London.
On paper Swing Hammer Swing seemed to be a prestige dream-package
guaranteed to generate high ratings. The best-selling novel won Glasgow
writer Jeff Torrington the #25,000 Whitbread Award and veteran Greenock
screenwriter Peter McDougall, with a proven track-record of hits with
the BBC, was commissioned to write the script. Major Scottish stars,
including Billy Connolly and Robbie Coltraine, were keen to join the
cast.
It's hard to imagine BBC Scotland pitching a hotter property -- but
London was not prepared to sanction the budget. McDougall, who can
safely be described as ''seriously enraged'', said: ''It proves that BBC
Scotland has no clout and is completely and utterly answerable to
London.
''Of course I'm not happy. This is the first piece I've written for TV
that hasnae been done. I've lost a year of my life on that script. When
I first realised the production was in serious jeopardy I didn't get in
touch with Jeff Torrington. I was too embarrassed.
''BBC Scotland kept me hanging on and hanging on. Every time I
threatened to make an outburst they came up with a new excuse. Around
Christmas I picked up The Herald and discovered that a stage production
of Swing Hammer was planned for the theatre. Then at New Year I was told
unofficially in a letter from a top producer in London that the film was
dead in the water. But the BBC still hadn't told me officially.''
The letter to McDougall reads in part: ''With you and him (Torrington)
together, everyone agrees it's a brilliant script . . . The book is,
after all, a modern classic of Scottish writing . . . But finally it
seems they are definitely not going to fund it.''
The long-running pre-production saga began when Swing Hammer Swing won
the Whitbread award in 1992. Senior BBC executives were at the ceremony
when Torrington, crippled with Parkinson's disease and in a wheelchair,
was handed the #25,000 cheque.
The BBC bought the rights and Bill Bryden, at that time head of
television drama in Scotland, asked McDougall to adapt the novel. The
writer and BBC TV have had a tempestuous but highly rewarding
association since his first televised script, Just Another Saturday, won
a clutch of international awards 20 years ago.
The visceral power of his writing has drawn stellar talent to BBC
productions. Jimmy Nail starred in Shoot For The Sun, an Edinburgh-set
drama of drug addiction. Harvey Keitel -- now a personal friend of the
playwright -- flew from New York to the Holy Loch to star as a US Navy
policeman on the strength of the script for Down Where the Buffalo Go.
Keitel's close associate, Martin Scorsese, was also impressed by the
script.
Billy Connolly played the starring role in the 1993 comedy-drama of a
bank heist in Glasgow, Down Among The Big Boys. With an audience close
to nine million it was one of the highest-rated BBC-produced films in
years.
McDougall generally shuns adaptations. The only exception to date was
his script for the electrifying Scottish TV film of Jimmy Boyle's
autobiography, A Sense of Freedom.''I only agreed to do Swing Hammer
Swing because the book was special,'' the writer said.
McDougall duly completed the script last summer. Despite some changes,
including a new ending, Jeff Torrington was happy with the result.
Others who read it, including his agent and top producers and actors,
considered it ''brilliant''.
''I widnae be moaning if the BBC had simply said they didn't like my
script. But it's no' that. I know that Billy Bryden got a fax saying the
script was 'absolutely wonderful'.
''The BBC must have liked it. If they don't like it you don't get the
second half of the fee and I've been paid in full. And it's no' as if
the work has dried up for me at the BBC. I've been commissioned and paid
for a series of six films starring Billy Connolly, called The Hunted.''
McDougall completed the last pages of the Swing Hammer script at eight
o'clock in the morning on June 17 last year and delivered it immediately
to the BBC.
''Weeks became months and nothing seemed to be happening. I kept on
and on making enquiries. 'Where's my budget . . . where's my film?' I
had lunch with John McCormack,'' (Controller BBC Scotland). ''He said
he'd been told there was a flaw in the book that even my expertise
couldn't solve. Whoever says there is a 'flaw' in the book is beyond
redemption. If there's a flaw why did the BBC buy it in the first place?
''Then Andrea Calderwood came round and told me the film might not be
made. I said, 'Do you really think I'll let it go at this?'.
''I know what the 'flaw' is. There's nae car chases. Nothing that gels
with the BBC's current thinking on whit makes a film.''
With a combative reputation like rolling thunder, imposing moustache
reminiscent of an old Union Pacific cowcatcher and a broad forehead
custom-built to deliver the Gorbals kiss, McDougall has never been noted
as a master of diplomacy. He tends to call a spade a spade. If that's
not enough he might well hit you with one.
Could there be an element of sour grapes in the writer's vociferous
criticism?
''Of course there's sour grapes in it. Whit's wrong wi' that. Only
those who have experienced it have any idea of the frustration you feel
trying to deal with the BBC as an individual. BBC Scotland is not the
real villain of the piece. It's a much bigger issue than that.''
Other leading television writers agree with McDougall.
Trevor Preston is generally recognised as one of the most brilliant TV
writers Britain has produced. A Bafta award winner, he has created a
string of hit shows in the past 20 years, including Out and Fox. He also
wrote the BBC Scotland thriller, The Negotiator, which starred Brian Cox
and was screened last autumn. It was intended as a pilot for a series.
But plans for other episodes have now been abandoned.
Preston sounded genuinely saddened when I told him the fate of Swing
Hammer Swing. ''I am terribly sorry to hear it has been axed,'' he said.
''It's a tragedy. I consider Peter McDougall the finest TV writer in the
country. He must be feeling the same sting I felt last week when The
Negotiator went down the plughole.''
The Negotiator was about a Glasgow policeman (based on the real-life
''Hammer of the Yard'', Sir David McNee) who operated in a shadowy world
as a broker between terrorists and police and the intelligence services.
''The film cost almost a million, you know,'' Preston added. ''The BBC
spent #10,000 on audience research to find out if the public thought it
would make a good series. The overwhelming majority said it would.
''But the BBC mucked me about for months. They wanted the political
element removed. What they seemed to want was a sort of superior
Taggart. The rot has started to set in. They want to reduce things to
the lowest common denominator and create television for tired bus
conductors. It's an insult to the audience.
''I sympathise with you in Scotland. But it's all part of a much
bigger problem with serious drama going down the shitter. The young
plonker of a producer who told me my Negotiator scripts didn't hack it
was wet behind the ears when I started writing for TV. He had the
audacity to start giving me a lecture on what was wrong with them and
what was required for popular television.
''It has all got very silly. It's sad.''
Preston is not the only seasoned writer whose work has had difficulty
in passing muster with the BBC. Michael Eaton got rave reviews for his
McCarthy witchhunt film, Fellow Traveller. His prime-time series, Signs
and Wonders, started on BBC2 this week.
It was produced in London. But a child-abuse film commissioned by BBC
Scotland had to be rewritten six times. It has now been given the final
approval and production work will begin soon. Like Preston he is shocked
to hear that Swing Hammer Swing is not now being made: ''It's exactly
the sort of drama that should be coming out of Scotland. If there is now
a lack of commitment to the regions it's a serious shift in policy. If
their autonomy is going to be eroded any further they might as well
dismantle them.''
Most of the projects that have been axed or are under threat were set
in motion by Bryden when he was head of drama at BBC Scotland.
Calderwood took over in the autumn of 1993.
While it's common practice in Hollywood for an incoming studio boss to
red-light any projects instigated by a predecessor these circumstances
should not apply at the BBC where public money has already been spent on
a project.
There is also a suggestion from those with an axe to grind that
Calderwood does not have the experience of a Bill Bryden, to pitch
projects at the highest level. Nor has she the clout or reputation that
enabled Bryden to attract international stars to BBC Scotland projects.
BBC Scotland yesterday rubbished this suggestion. ''Obviously we are
upset when we unable to make projects like Swing Hammer Swing,'' a
spokesman at Queen Margaret Drive said. ''But in defence of BBC Scotland
we do still have a busy production schedule.
''A new series called Hamish Macbeth (he's a West Highland policeman)
will be screened in the spring. There is also a second series of Cardiac
Arrest. Several single dramas are in the works. There is also a strand
of one-woman plays called Lambrusco Nights and a new string of Tartan
Shorts.''
It proves that BBC Scotland has no clout and is completely and utterly
answerable to London

She wanted to come to court, but she knew she could not handle it. I
don't think anyone ever gets over this sort of thing
Victim's boyfriend
A 17-year-old rapist who subject a second woman to a terrifying sex
ordeal while he was out on bail was sentenced to 14 years' detention
yesterday.
Lord Prosser told Kevin Melrose that the offences were among the worst
he had ever come across and that he had seriously considered detaining
him without limit of time, the equivalent of a life sentence.
The judge added: ''I don't suppose that you understand any better than
the rest of us why you did these terrible things.''
As Melrose was led from the dock at the High Court in Edinburgh, his
first victim shouted: ''I hope you f.....g rot in hell.'' Outside the
court, she was too distressed to speak about the case
The boyfriend of the second victim, who is a nurse, said no matter how
long the sentence was it was not enough and he spoke of the traumatic
effect the rape had had on his partner's life.
''Her whole life has been totally changed. She virtually will not go
out of the house now unless I am with her or somebody else is with her.
She will not even go to the shops, she is that frightened and insecure.
''With everybody she passes in the street, she thinks, 'Could he do
it?' I don't think she has had a decent night's sleep since it happened.
''She is receiving counselling and she is glad that she reported the
rape because she says, 'That is one less on the street'.
''She is trying to get the message across to anyone in the same
position that they should never be afraid to go forward and report it
because the treatment she has had from the police and back-up services
-- Victim Support especially -- has been brilliant.
''She wanted to come to court but she knew she could not handle it. I
don't think anyone ever gets over this sort of thing. You have just got
to try to come to terms with it.''
Melrose, from Calderwood Drive, High Blantyre, Lanarkshire, was 16
when he attacked his first victim, a 24-year-old, in Bothwell,
Lanarkshire, at 2am on March 18 last year.
He held a knife at her throat, demanded her keys, and pushed her into
her car.
He drove her to an isolated spot at Strathclyde Country Park,
Motherwell, where he forced her to strip before repeatedly raping her.
After Melrose left the scene, his victim repeatedly pressed the car
horn but no-one came to her aid. She alerted police from a payphone and
Melrose was picked up by police at a nearby roundabout.
However, when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court three days later,
he was released on bail.
He struck again on September 1, this time using a cigarette lighter
shaped like a gun, to terrify his victim, a 39-year-old woman whom he
attacked in High Blantyre.
As he drove the woman to an industrial estate where she was raped, she
tried in vain to attract the attention of passing motorists.
At one point, he told the woman: ''You have to die. You've seen my
face.''
Melrose admitted the rapes and a breach of the Bail Act when he
appeared at the High Court in Airdrie. Sentence had been deferred for
background reports, including a psychiatric report.
Miss Ruth Anderson, defence counsel, told the High Court in Edinburgh
yesterday that Melrose, who had tried to hang himself while on remand,
had left school a year ago, with no qualifications. He had three spells
on youth training schemes.
Miss Anderson described the rapes as ''two awful crimes'' in which the
victims were subjected to degrading and very frightening behaviour. She
added: ''Nothing can be said today to mitigate these crimes.''

MELES Zenawi, 35, is the President of the Transitional Government of
Ethiopia formed in June 1991 after the Derg, the mainly Soviet-backed
military dictatorship headed by Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, was
overthrown by the forces of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front (EPRDF). Mengistu fled to Harare, Zimbabwe, where he
remains under threat of extradition to Ethiopia to face charges of war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
President Meles, a former medical student, and now an external student
in management of London University, is a member of the Central Committee
of the EPRDF. During the 17-year civil war he was a guerrilla fighter,
mainly in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. He lived in the ''field'', in the
forests, and latterly in an underground cave which was the command
centre of the opposition forces.
In an exclusive interview, he told me: ''The suffering of our people
here in Ethiopia, and especially in Tigray, was related to a political
system which we had to fight -- we did not have a choice -- but we
always believed that the solution was to change that situation. Our
draft constitution ensures that no people or nation can be victimised
and each people will have regional and district autonomy. The country
has got to accommodate diversity because any other option will not
guarantee peace. Therefore it is in the interests of all the peoples,
and we have at least 82 ethnic groupings, each with their own language,
to support the new constitution.
''The real challenge to the EPRDF is in the towns. We're holding our
own in Addis Ababa but we still have to convince the intelligentsia --
in some ways they are the hardest to deal with, because what we've
achieved is to turn the whole system upside down. In the past the
peasants were the cannon-fodder -- now they are the masters. We have
lived with them for years and we know that the only solution is to focus
on rural issues. We are not just infatuated with the peasants -- this is
a long affair.
''We can mobilise our greatest resource -- the poor, the paupers --
but they have to be convinced that it is in their interests to work with
us -- and then it has to actually be in their interests.
''We respect the rights of all people to determine the course of their
own lives, even to the point of secession. We respect their rights to
language and culture but we believe that if people have freedom they
will opt to retain a national identity as well as an ethnic identity
within a united Ethiopian state.''
Turning to the forthcoming trials, President Meles said: ''This is a
hard-nosed calculation. The peasants are our power base and they want
revenge. We're saying that you have to take revenge on a system and in
the process you bury that system once and for all. It is difficult
personally for many of us, but we have to do this in a manner that
proves that we don't need to use their methods -- if you like, we have a
noble purpose, but we will not reduce ourselves to their level. Our
democracy would otherwise start off on the wrong foot.
''We have to prove that our system is humane. The real test is about
how you treat those who disembowelled pregnant women, and those who
bombed thousands. You treat them as human beings with certain rights,
both legal and human, even although their actions were sub-human.
''There will be no amnesty. Let me be absolutely clear about that.
Those who are found guilty must get what they deserve -- but they will
be found innocent or guilty in a proper manner.''
I asked President Meles about the grave food deficit which now
threatened a pan-Ethiopian famine. His reply was heartfelt: ''The scope
of the drought is as bad as in 1984 but so far there has been no massive
dislocation of people. The situation has become worse than we thought it
would, but with peace we can help the people to stay on their land so
that they can plant and harvest. In the long term our country has the
capacity to feed itself, but this will take time. So we are asking our
friends to help us bridge the gap.
''This Government has been on the receiving end of famine -- this was
always our worst enemy while the old regime drank whisky as thousands
went hungry. We are emotionally involved, and we know that peace is
critically important, as is our will to respond vigorously. We feel,
every one of us, that need to respond deep in our bones.''

CATCHES may have been scarce on the first day of the Tay salmon
fishing season -- but anglers were boosted yesterday by news from the
Tay Foundation.
The foundation's initial target -- to buy off 55% of netting business
on the river -- has been achieved, to the delight of the trustees.
Years of decline in Tay rod catches have been arrested and the
foundation is looking to the future with optimism.
A foundation spokesman said: ''After many months of detailed and
sometimes frustrating negotiation, and painstaking conveyancing work,
the trustees have now signed leases with three proprietors -- Scone
Estates (for 25 years), Perth and Kinross District Council (for 99
years) and The Tay Salmon Fisheries Company (for 99 years).''
He pointed out there had been no netting on the Tay above Elcho Castle
since the end of the 1991 season.
From a 1973 peak, when 12,000 fish were recorded at Pitlochry, figures
declined to a low of 2374 fish. However, the '93 count at Pitlochry was
5011 and last year it had edged up to 6700.
The spokesman said: ''There has been a substantial improvement in
catch statistics. While it would be most gratifying for the foundation
and all who voluntarily contributed towards its work to claim these
figures herald a new era, and are solely as a result of the de-netting
exercise, it would be foolish to jump to such a conclusion at this
stage.''
He warned against a sense of false security and noted that the Tay
Salmon Fisheries Company recently reported their worst catch figures in
more than a century. The rod fishing improvement had more to do with the
redistribution of the netting catch.

In 1988 the Derg bombed the peaceful market town of Hausien, not as a
prime military target but merely to intimidate the Tigrayan people.
Gerry McCann witnessed the carnage, and wept; now he has returned, and
sees a smile slowly reappearing.
JUST about all I could remember of Tigrinya was ''Camelaha, shemi
Gerry''. Mekonnen Yousef, a tall boy of about 12 who looked proud in his
grey school suit, had taken me for a tourist and asked for money. We
were white faces in a new Tigray and walking in Hausien, the devastated
town that had seen so much sorrow. I was shaking his small bony hand and
saying that he must not be a beggar. My words in his language unleashed
his eyes, which sparkled and danced around the faces of his friends. By
now they all knew -- I was the ferenge who was here before, in the
darkness, in 1988 when the town was bombed. The attempt at obliteration
had failed.
The last time I was here I photographed destruction -- of the market,
the houses, the school, the unfathomable might of high explosive on
precious flesh. I had come walking, night after night, sleeping in the
day under green plastic sheets in the shade of the baobab trees and
sometimes in farmyards where the bulls seemed a bigger threat than the
banda who were trying to kill us.
I remembered a lot. I was snapping a boy sitting on a huge unexploded
bomb and yet I felt no danger. Now the carcass of the bomb and two
others, emptied of their fatal cargo, lie in the town square like the
war memorials we have in the United Kingdom. I remembered my choking
throat as I photographed Tsahei Geredche, the woman whose seven children
were made fatherless and who was recognised by my own father as the
Black Madonna. I remembered the fighters who preserved my life to bring
the story home. Mohammed, who was famous for having shot down a MiG with
his Kalashnikov, with only the minor loss of one eye in the process,
commandeered my jacket. It seemed a small price since I also had a
jersey. Geday, who was a very serious proposition, had taken great
offence when he caught me showing the rest a Highland dance over two
crossed rifles.
But mostly I remembered Tamri. When we were scouting through the
gullies he would simply stop, crouch down, and whisper ''Dergi''. I was
a Glasgow boy, transported mainly on my own insistence, into a very real
war. Tamri understood that I had to get my film back and that is why he
alone knew that the three rolls in my underpants were the most
important.
Between us we determined that these frames were more important than
both of us. Some of those images are now with the Special Prosecutor's
Office in Addis Abada.
Back in Hausien I remembered these three men who had all taken a stand
with their lives against the evil of the Derg. And I met a man who knew.
He told me that Mohammed was alive and in Tigray. Geday was ''no longer
living'' -- I don't know how he died. Tamri was a unit commander in the
new Ethiopian army. By a curious twist of fate I was on the Somali side
of the Ethiopian border in 1993 and was prevented from crossing into
Ethiopia by young fighters at a border post. Now I discovered that Tamri
was posted there at the time.
And again back in Hausien, this town which buried the dead for a
month. Now it is a real town again. There is no curfew. People walk
about in the daylight and do not fear that their lives will be bombed
into oblivion. Children laugh and play and take great delight in
shouting ''Ferenge, ferenge''. The school is so packed that the students
have to learn in three sittings each day and there are not enough
teachers or books. The market is once again the bustling epicentre of
the region's trade, and houses and grain mills are being rebuilt.
Hausien has become a symbol of the country's rebirth. The bombing of
this vibrant market town was an act of calculated barbarity -- part of a
plan to subdue a people who simply desired to live peaceful lives. If
this was an act of evil then its consequences bear further scrutiny. Any
culture in the world can only see this as evil personified in the
actions of men. But the bombing of Hausien was so extreme, both in its
systematic conspiracy to complete the deed and its effect in galvanising
the victims in their opposition to the perpetrators that it became the
beginning of the death of evil.
The sheer beauty of peace is tangible in Hausien. There is great
optimism now that there can be real moves towards a society that is free
from oppression, conflict, and famine. Ethiopia has the potential to
become one of the most progressive countries in Africa. On this trip to
Tigray I was able to fly there and to hire a car and this in itself is
proof that Ethiopians have come the full circle from war to peace. Now
they need our support and goodwill to consolidate their hard-fought
gains. There is no irony in the fact that my assignment was to gather
material for a CD-ROM being produced by the Development Education
Department of SCIAF (Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund), which
can be contacted at 5 Oswald Street, Glasgow G1 4QR. Tel: 041 221 4447.

ARMCHAIR rugby fans north of the Border will miss out on live coverage
of today's friendly match at Murrayfield between Scotland and Canada.
Instead, BBC Scotland will screen live coverage of the Ireland-England
Five Nations' championship match from Lansdowne Road, Dublin, and
highlights of the France-Wales game in Paris.
One irate fan, Mr Jim Smith, from Ralston, Renfrewshire, said last
night: ''The BBC should think shame of itself. The Scotland rugby fan
tomorrow who is not at Murrayfield will be looking to sit in front of
his TV and watch Scotland, not a game he is not interested in.''
He argued that the England-Canada match was televised live some weeks
ago, and asked: ''Why can't Scottish viewers be afforded the same
privilege? Could you imagine England fans watching the Scotland-Canada
game while the Dublin game is being played?''
A BBC Scotland spokeswoman said: ''It was a management decision to
show the Five Nations' match live. We are contractually obliged to show
the Five Nations' Championship.''
She said highlights of the Scotland-Canada match would be shown on BBC
2 tomorrow on Sportscene Rugby Special at 4.05pm.

Beijing, Friday
PEOPLE in Beijing shopped for the Chinese New Year today, most unaware
of foreign reports of the impending death of their leader, Deng
Xiaoping.
Newspapers in Hong Kong said today that Deng was unconscious in a
hospital. According to one account, senior officials have been asked to
stay in Beijing to handle any repercussions if he dies soon.
The reports follow a Chinese Government statement yesterday that Deng
was in good health for a man of 90. Today China's state-run news media
said nothing about Deng's condition.
Any word some Beijing residents had of the latest reports was from
foreign TV or shortwave radio broadcasts, or word-of-mouth news from
Guangdong province, where information flows from Hong Kong.
Shops in the capital were decorated with red lanterns and other
decorations for the holiday on January 31, China's main occasion for
family reunions and get-togethers with friends.
The Asian Wall Street Journal reported from Beijing that Deng has been
in a coma since the end of last month. It quoted a source as saying Deng
was unlikely to live beyond the end of March.
The Eastern Express newspaper in Hong Kong said Deng had been in
critical condition in hospital for several weeks after a stroke.
Quoting sources in Hong Kong and Beijing, the newspaper said Deng's
condition had improved and stabilised but he remained in ''a
near-vegetable state and . . . any recovery will be difficult''.
Deng's daughter told the New York Times last week that her father
could no longer walk or stand.
Deng is credited with engineering economic reforms that have
transformed China since the late 1970s. He retired in 1989, but held on
to power behind the scenes.
One Western diplomat recently said he did not believe any dramatic
changes would follow immediately after Deng's death. China's president
and party chief, Jiang Zemin, was chosen by Deng as his successor.
Other Western diplomats said they detected no unusual troop movements
that might indicate fears of unrest. Chinese officials proceeded as
usual with their appointments, diplomats said.
However the reports of Deng's ill health pushed down stock prices
today in Hong Kong and on China's two stock markets in Shanghai and
Shenzhen. Taiwan's stock market fell 3.4%.
Deng was last seen in public during Chinese New Year celebrations in
February, when he appeared frail.
The Hong Kong Standard said senior Communist Party and army officials
were asked to forgo leave for the Chinese New Year and stay in Beijing
in case Deng dies.--AP.

The Derg regime in Ethiopia was one of the most murderous on the face
of the earth. But in May, 1991, it was overthrown by a combination of
rebel forces, who now form a government charged with returning peace and
justice to that troubled land. In what was once a death centre, hundreds
of the Derg's leaders are awaiting trial on charges of crimes against
humanity in what will be the biggest prosecution since Nuremberg. In a
special report, Gerry McCann goes into the house of horrors and talks to
some of those accused of genocide -- and to survivors of the torture.
REVERSALS of political fortune in Africa are all too often accompanied
by the sound of the Kalashnikov. Summary justice is a euphemism for
revenge. And in Ethiopia today there are thousands of citizens,
particularly Tigrayans, with cause to be vengeful. Three years after its
overthrow, the full horror of the Derg regime's 17-year reign of terror
is being revealed.
Yet there seem to be no kangaroo courts in Ethiopia, one of the
poorest countries in Africa. In an effort unprecedented in the
continent, its Transitional Government, headed by Meles Zenawi, is
seeking, through its Special Prosecutor's Office, to bring to justice
the perpetrators of crimes against humanity. The task would be daunting
for the sophisticated legal system of a developed country. Here it is
almost overwhelming in its complexity and scale.
Thousands of testimonies have been taken from surviving victims and
the relatives of many who were killed. In the past few months an
execution centre has been unearthed just outside Addis Ababa. Its mass
grave contained the skeletons of about 30 victims of hanging. In the
Tigrayan market town of Hausien, which was bombed for a full day on June
22, 1988, by Derg MiGs and helicopters with the loss of some 2000 lives,
there is a rebuilding programme going on. But only last November the
demolition of devastated homes revealed yet more human remains.
When the Derg, under strongman Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, seized
control in 1974, its first act of barrel-of-the-gun supremacy was to
imprison the imperial court of Haile Selassie in the End of the World, a
self-contained death centre two kilometres from the middle of Addis. In
1975 all 60, 43 ministers and 17 generals, faced a firing squad. Their
day of reckoning, the end of a feudal dynasty, had come, and they were
shot against the wall of an insignificant small building. In the same
year the Emperor died -- the Lion of Judah succumbed to natural causes,
at least allegedly -- but there would be no lionising of the god-king.
He was buried under tons of concrete and the site made secret.
Meanwhile the small, seemingly insignificant building was provided
with electricity. In a room within, the Derg's torturers began to exact
their power on the genitals, nipples, and open souls of a generation of
Ethiopians.
The victim -- for each man, woman, and child at least deserves a
singular description here -- would have been brought to a complex of
three rooms. The entrance would take you through a series of three
booths lined with an iron tube about 15ft from the ground which served
as gallows. At the end was a waiting-room -- there were no beds, no
comfort, just waiting. The building was cheap with thin walls, so you
could hear the screams. When your turn came you would be taken to the
third room which contained a sinister electrical contraption to which
you would be wired. On your left you would see, through a slit window,
those who had been there before being hanged from the iron tube.
What presumption to imagine what would be in your mind -- you would
betray the innocent, as you were betrayed. You would ask only for the
pain to stop -- you'd tell them anything, or nothing. Or you might try
to fight them -- you might wish to make your body leave your mind. Or
you might, maybe you must, ask them to kill you. The chances were that
they would.
When Addis fell to the rebel army in May 1991 ownership of the End of
the World changed hands. The electrical contraption became a macabre
museum-piece. The citadel disgorged its remaining inmates, many with the
scars of eight or nine years of horror, some unable to comprehend their
survival.
Nowadays the End of the World has 407 inmates -- and they are all past
officials of the Derg. They include 41 security police, 100 ministers,
and 206 people who were employed during the Red Terror of 1977; some can
be classified in more than one way. All had senior positions and plied
their trades in different ways. They also include doctors, a professor,
teachers, soldiers, traders who operated as informers, and one is a
74-year-old incontinent man who has to be lifted by the others and who
wears a sweatshirt bearing the legend ''I am the Boss''. His mind seems
to be gone.
He's not the boss now and the minds of the others are not gone --
though they are not entirely focused either. The prisoners have their
own committee, understandably wary of the media. They all have one thing
in common -- they all claim to be innocent.
The chairman of the Prisoners' Committee is Abdul Hafiz, 44, who
declines to be photographed, but twice excuses himself to receive
visitors. Each time his position as spokesman is taken by Kassa Jareto,
43, who used to work for Ethiopian Airlines and was chairman of Kebele
17 during the Red Terror, or by Bekela Molla, 35, who was ''a simple
civil servant at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and I dealt with state
secrets''.
The Prisoners' Committee speaks as one man when it says: ''The prison
is congested and the latrines are not good. There are only two hours'
exercise each day, in groups of 100, but this is sometimes cancelled
because 'they have other business'. The cells hold between five and 18
people and there is no place to read. The food is fairly good and there
are visits every morning. There is supposedly medical treatment but only
10 people can see the doctor each day and prescriptions have to be
bought. There is no maltreatment, none at all, although we know of a man
who was tied up with electrical flex in another prison -- he told us
that two years ago. We cannot say we are well treated but we are not
badly treated.''
As we get to the question of forthcoming trials Abdul Hafiz returns
from one of his visits and resumes the role of spokesman: ''We should be
charged under Ethiopian law and if we are tried fairly and this leads to
death then so be it -- we were proud of what we did for our country. But
most of us don't think we will get a fair trial -- how can we trust this
Government? We want the international community to put pressure on, but
the West has forgotten us because we are communists. The Government
bribes witnesses by paying their rent so they'll speak to the SPO but
some people are just settling old scores. They say that the crimes of
the last 17 years are so immense that it is very difficult for them to
bring us to court. Speedy trial is a basic human right -- are we to be
deprived of our rights because of their inefficiency and lack of
manpower?''
But Abdul Hafiz is not exactly an innocent victim caught up in
political turmoil. In 1977-78 when the Red Terror campaign demanded that
grieving parents paid for the bullets used to execute their children in
the street, he was in the political cadre in Wollo. He must have
impressed someone because from 1985-91 he was Mengistu's Minister of
Information. The job of his department was generally to keep the lid on
the fact that his Government was systematically killing and torturing
thousands of its own people.
The End of the World is not quite that for at least one of its inmates
-- Debelle Dinssa wants to speak freely. At 53 he looks fitter than some
of the others and wears a ring depicting the region of Shewa, of which
he was the Governor in 1978. As a young major representing the police he
was one of the founders of the Derg and eventually became
Vice-President. He depicts the 17 years of Derg rule as a hard struggle
when he says: ''I often disagreed with Mengistu, especially over
arbitrary arrest and the restriction of grain movement. But the war is
difficult to define for me -- the Eritreans wanted separation and the
TPLF wanted more democracy but the country wasn't ready for that. It was
hard to argue with Mengistu because the slogan was 'Ethiopia United',
but I think we should have begun talks with the TPLF in 1988 and maybe
the problem could have been solved peacefully. But his mistake was that
he didn't listen to his comrades or to the people and the end result of
that is destruction.
''When the TPLF came into Addis on May 28 they asked me to surrender,
although I was already pensioned off for health reasons by then. So I
went to the Ministry of Defence to give up some weapons; I did not
intend to offer my hand but they sent me away anyway. I didn't think I
would be arrested but eight months later I was detained even though I
never tried to flee.''
Debelle Dinssa's belated arrest may have more to do with his own
regime's fervour for documentation. Every action was catalogued and
little was shredded. Even now, three years on, implications of
involvement are coming to light as the thousands of documents are
analysed by the SPO. Coming under close scrutiny is the resettlement
campaign of the mid-eighties when the Government forcibly moved whole
communities, numbering as many as 600,000 people, ostensibly to relocate
them in areas with less severe food shortages, but in fact to deprive
the guerrillas of local support.
Dinssa says: ''In 1977 there was a guerrilla war in Addis Ababa with
killing on all sides and we had to fight back against terrorism within
the State. But as far as I know the Derg gave no orders for torture or
execution. I cannot say that everything was perfect -- with individuals
there may have been abuses, but there was no systematic campaign -- it
would have been immoral to torture people. And is resettlemnt a crime? I
can't believe that 100,000 died. We couldn't leave them there to die.
Perhaps the deaths were unavoidable but the intention was good. If the
Government wanted to kill them it could just have left them there.''
The prisoners repeatedly assert that justice delayed is justice
denied. That the trials will take place is in no doubt, but the delays
in starting them is fuelling the prisoners' claims that they are
illegally detained. But Dawitt Johannes, chairman of the Legal Committee
of the Council of Representatives, says: ''So far we are investigating
around 110,000 deaths. We know that there were around 5000 key
individuals and of these 1650 are in detention. Three burial sites have
revealed about 70 victims and there may be another 40 of these sites.
There are now 40,000 pieces of evidence logged on computer and our
resources are limited. So of course there are delays but don't forget
that the US took two years to bring Noriega to trial. No developing
country has ever attempted to try such a repressive system, and we are
trying desperately to maintain a democratic process.
''But all this takes time. For example we have had to appoint new
judges who will be seen as politically neutral, as well as to train the
public defenders. Surely the international community can see that we
have tried to create a new judicial system which is not based on revenge
but which will help to ensure that this never happens again?''
The debate rages on in Addis Ababa but the trials are now imminent.
There will be four courts, each with three judges who will determine
guilt or innocence and pass sentence. They will be televised, although
some of the evidence is said to be too horrific to broadcast. New
prisons are being built, but for some this may not be necessary, since
those convicted of the most heinous crimes will be sentenced to death.
KASSA Tadesse's troubles really began when he was born a Tigrayan. As
a gifted student of economics at Addis Ababa University he was selected
by the Derg to undertake postgraduate studies in Havana, Cuba. But
Kassa, 37, was part of the resistance, his mission being to organise
cells which provided intelligence to the Tigrayan People's Liberation
Front.
By the final week of 1983 one of his colleagues had been arrested in
Addis, tortured, and had named him as an accomplice. Kassa was arrested
in Havana and loaded aboard an Aeroflot jet with a contingent of Cuban
soldiers returning to their missions in Angola and Ethiopia. Scheduled
to refuel in Cape Verde Islands, the aircraft was diverted by bad
weather to Dakar, Senegal. There on the tarmac it was surrounded by
local military and its occupants warned to stay on board.
Kassa was allowed to go to the toilet, accompanied by two guards who
stood at the door. After two or three minutes he opened the door and saw
the guards talking to the pilots. He had one chance only and launched
himself through the door, vaulted the steps, and sprinted down the
runway. For the next 24 hours he pleaded with Senegalese immigration for
asylum, arguing that as a member of the opposition he faced death if he
returned to Ethiopia. His plea that he was fighting Russian interference
in Africa fell on deaf ears, and the Cubans were refusing to leave
without their prisoner.
Kassa was put back on the aircraft, his hands tied. He knew he was in
trouble when they landed in Luanda and he was transferred to an airport
prison run by Cuban ''Internationalists''. He was then taken by
Ethiopian Airlines to Addis, where he was driven to the residence of the
Cuban ambassador, from where he was processed through various police
offices to the Derg Headquarters prison in the Grand Palace. Kassa
remembers that his investigator, Tefera Work, who was known as WeqUaw,
announced to his boss that ''the thing had arrived''. Kassa's ordeal as
an inmate of Mengistu's prisons had begun; it would last a further eight
years and six months.
He remained in this prison for two weeks of what was euphemistically
called interrogation. His only food came from other prisoners and his
family had no idea he was even in the country. Then, with another man
called Tamrat Guangule, he was sent to Agassi Prison in Mekelle, the
Tigrayan capital -- it was four months before his parents discovered his
whereabouts and were allowed to bring in basic supplies. Prisoners had
little contact with the world, no pens, paper, newspapers nor radio.
There were no mattresses and they slept on the stony ground.
Kassa speaks calmly about his treatment. ''Almost all of us were
tortured, although very few of us were in the TPLF. Just being a
Tigrayan was enough. They only had to suspect that you had opposition
leaflets or even sympathy with them. There were even victims who
themselves had innocent Tigrayan blood on their hands from the Red
Terror campaign. There were no family visits and you only saw the
sunlight when you went for interrogation.''
Kassa was transferred back to Addis after a year and missed being
freed when the TPLF stormed Agassi in a carefully-rehearsed raid. In
Addis, he was taken to The End of the World where the torture continued.
''They would tie your hands and toes together and put a stick behind
your legs so that they could hang you upside down and then beat your
feet with a baton. On other occasions they would immerse your head
repeatedly in a barrel of water so that you thought you were drowning.
Of course you would vomit. If you knew you were for this one you just
prayed that you would be the first in a fresh barrel. And there were
beatings all the time, sometimes where you were hung from the roof by
the shoulders. The arms of many people were paralysed in this way.''
There were many who did not survive but Kassa remembers them. ''They
would pull a person's nails out with pliers and then plunge their hands
into boiling water and some people were burned alive by having pepper
and petrol spread on their back and then set alight. Sometimes this
happened in a special centre we called 'Bermuda' for obvious reasons.
Among those who died were Dr Gebre Hiwot and a driver named Desalegne.''
According to Kassa, the treatment of the prisoners depended on how the
war was going. If the TPLF were doing well the Derg seemed wary of
maltreatment, so there were periods when visits were allowed and the
food improved to a ration of three pieces of bread and two cups of tea
each day. But when the Derg was succeeding in a campaign the prisoners
came off worse. In October 1985 a pogrom saw the deaths of Colonel
Kessaye Weldeeb, Colonel Gabre Yohannes Assfaw, Tedesse Gebre Egziabher,
Habtu Araya, Mulugeta Hagos, Muhe Abdu, Dejazmach Asegehegne Araya,
Kebede, and Gesehegne Kassahun among many others.
Kassa fully expected that the End of the World would, for him, be just
that, but he survived and was freed on May 27, 1991, when the combined
insurgent forces overwhelmed Addis Ababa. By this time Kassa had not
been tried for any crime and he had never been asked to defend his case
except when being tortured.

THE rough Mediterranean port of Toulon is garrison to the higher
officer ranks of the French navy and, of course, their wives, who keep a
tightly elegant grip on the town's social life.
It is also home to a large immigrant Arab population and has a
portside red-light area, known as Chicago. Prostitutes from nearby
Marseilles work there, travelling in by train whenever the American
fleet drops anchor. Chicago and most of the town is cut off from any
sight of the sea by a row of hideous post-war, high-rise flats.
It is perfect National Front territory and it is in Toulon, tonight,
that the party's leader Jean-Marie Le Pen is holding a rally, one of the
first big meetings for the presidential election in May.
The campaign begins in earnest this weekend. For the next five months
it will absorb every scrap of political energy and be reflected in every
political act and commentary. A more profound change than a British
General Election, France's presidential poll shakes the political tree
from top to bottom. The outcome will determine the country's course for
the next seven years and make or break a lot of careers.
It will also strengthen or wreck leading political parties, none of
which can be sure of emerging from the poll intact.
Absurdly enough, even the Paris Stock Exchange, which should have been
reassured by two such candidates of stockbrokers' dreams, Edouard
Balladur and his right-wing challenger, Jacques Chirac, is already
jittery about the prospect of a hard-fought election frightening off
investment.
Mr Le Pen's meeting in Toulon will be more predictable -- theatrical,
verbally violent, and hedged in by well-drilled gangs of skinheads armed
with baseball bats.
His message will be: Reserve employment and healthcare for French and
European nationals, build more prisons, bring back the guillotine, and
expel three million Arab immigrants.
Mr Le Pen's message is for those who lack confidence in Mr Balladur,
whom National Front campaign leader, Bruno Megret, compared yesterday to
a teddy bear given to a child to help it sleep. Mr Le Pen should attract
urban, working-class voters who would have voted for Bernard Tapie (now
bankrupt and out of the race), and he could score more than 10%.
Anything weaker could bring about a leadership contest in his party.
The elf-like Robert Huc, new leader of that other fixed pole of French
political life, the Communist Party, could score more than 5%. France's
ecologists, who mustered only a few per cent in the last European
election, will be represented by no fewer than three presidential
candidates, presumably bent on destroying their fragile collective
cause.
Leading members of France's battered and deeply unpopular Socialists
will be scheming this weekend about whom to back on February 3, when the
party chooses its candidate. One hopeful is former party leader Lionel
Jospin, a right-winger.
He will be met by the First Secretary, the craggy Henri Emmanuelli.
Very much a left-winger, the grandson of a Corsican shepherd and son of
militant Communists, Mr Emmanuelli has said he would always prefer to be
''a left-wing brute than an anaesthetised Paris intellectual''.
To complicate matters, one of the latter, former Culture Minister Jack
Lang, is also contemplating standing. Weakened by such internal power
struggles, dithering over policy, long since abandoned by the ailing
President Mitterrand, the Socialist Party looks on the point of going
down the plughole of history.
Strangely, given the massive public support shown in the polls for the
right-wing candidates, France's two conservative parties -- the
Gaullists, or RPR, founded in 1976, and the UDF set up two years later
-- are not happy either. The UDF still has no candidate of its own,
mainly because most of its members are rooting for Mr Balladur.
Yet he is an RPR man, as is his main rival, Mr Chirac. Well ahead in
the polls, with Mr Balladur leading, the two men have similar election
platforms but highly different styles. Both have senior supporters in
their party, who, with long-term career plans in mind, have started
declaring over recent days where their sympathies lie. If the fight
grows bloody, the RPR could simply break up, and the UDF could fade away
altogether.

POSTAL services were disrupted yesterday after 13,000 London workers
went on strike in an escalating dispute over working practices.
Deliveries to parts of the capital were halted and letters bound for
other areas of the country were held up. The dispute started at the
north-west London sorting office in Camden, where workers are in dispute
over a computer system which they say increases their workload.

TWO of the nine Stirling University students caught by the Japanese

their lecturer, said yesterday that they hoped they would leave Kobe
today.
Dane Lars Jorgensen and Taiwanese student Che-hsien Lai were about to
start walking to Osaka, 13 miles away, when they picked up a chance lift
to the nearest functioning railway.
''They were all ready to go, and just before they left a member of the
Japan/Scotland Society arrived and said he had found a way out,'' said
the group's spokeswoman, graduate student Irene McVey, 26, of Liberton,
Edinburgh.
Miss McVey said the two were taken to Kyoto, some 50 miles away, and
had phoned to say they had arrived safely.
She said the rest of group was expecting to leave Kobe by motorcycle
today in a rescue attempt organised by their travel insurers, Endsleigh.
''I'm sure we're all going to be home soon,'' she said.
An attempt by the university authorities to evacuate them through Kobe
port failed, owing to appalling conditions in the town.

BRITAIN is to deploy 15 helicopters, including three heavy-lift
Chinook transporters, to support its 3350-strong peacekeeping force in
Bosnia.
The move, announced yesterday, is ostensibly aimed at bolstering the
UN presence along the battlefronts and allowing easier policing of the
fragile, four-month truce brokered by Lieutenant-General Sir Michael
Rose, the military commander of all UN contingents in the country.
However the deployment is also intended as a means of providing
air-lift capability if the evacuation of British forces becomes
necessary in the next few months.
Each Chinook can carry 44 fully-laden troops, or up to 60 with light
equipment. In the event of an emergency withdrawal opposed by any of the
combatants, most vehicles and other military hardware would be blown up
and abandoned.
Six Lynx dual-purpose attack and transport helicopters and six Gazelle
scout aircraft are also to be sent to reinforce the flight of four Royal
Navy Sea King helicopters based at Split on the Croatian coast.
The 19-strong helicopter fleet would be capable, if necessary, of
lifting from 300 to 400 troops simultaneously. The Chinook can cope with
an underslung load of up to 10 tonnes, but the 30-tonne Warrior armoured
personnel carriers used by the British would have to fight their way out
or be destroyed before evacuation.
The 700 men of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, currently in some of the
most exposed UN positions in northern and north-western Bosnia, would be
most at risk if the ceasefire broke down and a UN withdrawal became
unavoidable.
They would either have to make a potentially costly 150-mile retreat
down narrow, easily-blocked mountain roads, or go out in batches by
airlift.
The UN has asked for a further 6000 troops from member nations to
build its strength in the disputed region. The new UK contingent
includes 200 ground and aircrew, and 20 military observers.
Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, Sweden,
Turkey, and the United States have all also offered either troops or
equipment.
Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith, who commanded the British 1st
Armoured Division during the 1991 Gulf War, is due to replace General
Rose as UN commander in Bosnia on Monday.

THE Ministry of Defence was last night accused of betraying RAF
Kinloss in Moray after it awarded the maintenance contract for the
base's Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft to private companies rather than
an in-house team.
At present, 244 airmen and 15 civilians service the fleet of Nimrods.
Yesterday, however, the MoD announced that a consortium of FR Aviation,
of Bournemouth, and Serco, of Hayes, Middlesex, had beaten a joint bid
by the base and British Aerospace.
Moray MP Mrs Margaret Ewing reacted angrily to both the decision and
the manner in which the announcement had been handled.
The decision was relayed yesterday in a letter from Defence Minister
Roger Freeman to Mrs Ewing. She broke the news to base commander Group
Captain Bob Joseph, who said later: ''I am extremely disappointed. We
considered our bid to be the keenest and the best value for money.''
The contract will run for five years, with the option of a further
two. An MoD spokesman said it was understood that the new private
joint-venture company would be recruiting about 160 people, and that the
work would continue to be done at RAF Kinloss.
He added that it was his understanding that the service personnel
would be deployed elsewhere in the RAF.
Mrs Ewing declared: ''It appears that 25 years of expertise,
commitment, and dedication are to be thrown aside for the sake of a few
pennies in the Government's drive for a monetarist policy.
''It is a gross insult to the dedicated team at RAF Kinloss who are
now to be re-deployed on an indirect basis, not as a unit with all their
teamwork and combined knowledge.
''The MoD is clearly more interested in its bank balance than the
dignity and decency of a team who have displayed loyalty. The behaviour
of the MoD can only be defined as a betrayal.''
The base, near Forres, has more than 2600 military personnel and is a
key component in the economy of Moray district. Councillor Eddie
Aldridge, convener of Moray District Council, described the MoD's
decision as a ''catastrophe'' and accused the Government of
''privatisation through the back door''.

Winston Silcott's conviction for the murder of Anthony Smith in 1984, it
said yesterday. However, a spokeswoman denied a claim by Silcott's
solicitor that Home Secretary Michael Howard was to consider the case
afresh. She said the Home Office would listen to any representations Mr

Alistair Campsie examines the remarkable and sinister political
coincidences which attended Burns's financial ruin and premature death.
BACK in 1982 I was giving a lecture on ''Burns, the Political
Journalist'' at a St Andrews University summer school and mentioned the
200-year-old smear campaign against the poet which alleged he was an
uncontrollable alcoholic who was also a sex maniac: a formidable
contradiction in terms from even some of the lies peddled today by the
contemporary truth-twisters.
''It was as easy then to blacken a character with quill pen as it is
nowadays with a ballpoint,'' I remarked with deep feeling, as I was
undergoing the worst smear-job this century by the ''literary'' pygmies,
which still writhes on.
After the lecture, I was, to my astonishment, approached by an elderly
American who told me that he was a direct descendant of Tom Paine and
also informed me that his famous ancestor suffered a similar fate to
Burns. Paine was blackened throughout the Americas by British secret
service agents for the rest of his life, so that no-one would even
accept him into their houses.
The object was to isolate him, destroy his credibility, and rubbish
his acclaimed work. Most journalists knew how the smear campaign
operated, for it surfaced yet again with Harold Wilson in the sixties
and Ulster thereafter, although the public were denied such fruity
details.
Tom Paine was in fact a former temporary exciseman who was so
disgruntled by his meagre pay that he petitioned MPs for a goodly rise.
He was instantly sacked for his impudence and he emigrated (escaped?) to
the Americas. There he wrote the pamphlet, Common Sense, which was
credited with starting the American Revolution -- and instantly became a
marked man.
Tom Paine later wrote The Rights of Man, which was at first tolerated
by the British authorities, but later condemned as seditious. A savage
example was made of a young Scottish advocate, Thomas Muir, for handing
it on and he was later transported to Australia for 14 years.
Behind Muir's conviction lay Henry Dundas, then the dictator of
Scotland, who was also held responsible by the King for losing the
American colonies by reason of his contemptuous and roughshod treatment
of the colonies. Dundas, also despised by the King for his drunkenness
and whoring, is coiled into the Burns story like a vengeful snake.
The facts are that if Paine had been given a permanent Excise post he
would have been compelled to take the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown
and any seditious remark from him could have resulted in a charge of
high treason and the death sentence. He would thus have been effectively
gagged.
It has not been previously noted that after Burns was forced to take
the Oath of Allegiance to King George III before the justices of the
peace at Dumfries quarter sessions on October 27, 1789, he never
published another seditious poem under his name in his own lifetime.
Instead he concentrated on writing and rewriting folk songs.
Dundas the dictator was Scottish manager for Pitt the Younger's
administration and horse-traded Government jobs and sinecures in return
for votes. All Government posts were in Dundas's personal gift, and the
country was in fact a vast Quangoland which makes Ian Lang's patronage
look like a doll's tea party.
The political situation was that the Americas had gone up in
revolution and Home Office spies on the Continent were advising that the
French Revolution was on its way. The 1745 civil war had ended only 40
years earlier and the last hanging of a Jacobite rebel was in 1753.
And into this revolutionary hotbed rode young Robert Burns on a
borrowed pony preaching liberty, equality, and the brotherhood of man.
Meanwhile this young seditious poet stood to make about #1000 on paper
from his Edinburgh edition and was threatening to go back to farming in
which he had been set up for life. And churning out sedition to his army
of like-minded revolutionaries from young to old, but mostly the
impressionable young.
It has ayeways been a matter of amusement to me that almost all the
legion of professional Burns girns (beg pardon -- experts) who have
pontificated at elasticated length about the poet, what made him tick,
the great crises in his shortened life, and what he actually meant to
say in verse, plus some or other ''new'' derogatory finding of their
own, missed the political point out of naivety.
The problem is that not one of the girns that I can discover ever
followed a horse's backside down the weary dreels, never worked to
exhaustion six days a week, then worked a seventh, never went hungry,
never endured poverty, never made love to a lass on an endrig, never
sowed the same rigs with corn out of a sheet, never cowpt a'hint nor
drew a feering', and worse still never kent what it meant, never put the
last twae stooks up at night when your arms were done, never even kent
why stooks went from west to east and had twa mair sheafs in the east
than in the west, and if they could ever write Burns preferred Standard
Habbie, they have surely been ower blate to tell us, and never talked
the man's tongue but learnt it frae a buik.
Indeed, one world-famous expert once recited to me a verse from
Burns's great love song, Of A' the Airts, written for Jean Armour during
the honeymoon, and claimed that ''rivers rowe'' rhymed with ''go'' and
''wild woods grow'' rhymed with ''dough'', of which they all made large
goppins, and a lifetime's cushy living out of Burns's misery.
Instead Burns was forced to spend his royalties in Edinburgh because
his publisher refused to settle up, was tricked out of his priceless
copyright for a pittance, and was conned into leasing a run-down farm at
a rack rent.
When I first ''walked'' Ellisland in 1959 I was astonished that a
skilful young farmer like Burns would ever have taken the place. The
soil was so littered with stones it looked like snow in midsummer, and
Burns indeed left several letters alleging the farm would ruin him,
which it did. There obviously had to be another inducement to sign the
lease.
Adam Smith, in contrast, was made a Commissioner of Excise in 1777,
permitting him to spend the remainder of his life in near-luxury. The
answer came 200 years later, when Mrs Thatcher described Smith ''as one
of us''.
So let us examine the remarkable and sinister political coincidences
which attended Burns's financial ruin, broken health, and premature
death. All the persons concerned with his downfall or members of their
family were rewarded by Dundas with posts or favours which were solely
in his personal gift. And given for services rendered.
Lord Glenlee was described as a close friend of the Dundases who was
the brother of Burns's landlord. He was surprisingly made Lord President
of the Court of Session in 1788 at the age of 71. The following year he
was even created a baronet and died.
Patrick Miller, brother of the above, was an Edinburgh bank governor
and given the Tory seat of Dumfries Burghs. Miller also came out with a
farm in good heart which he sold for twice its cost out of the sweat of
Burns's bankrupt brow.
William Tennant of Glenconner tricked Burns into taking the farm of
Ellisland, pretending to be a family friend. His son, William, was made
chaplain of the British Forces in India, a post redolent with loot and
graft. The Tennants became the Lords Glenconner, and have long
considered that the family is cursed.
William Creech, Burns's publisher, refused to settle up with Burns for
almost two years, keeping him in Edinburgh spending his royalties,
meaning that he went into Ellisland under-capitalised, accelerating his
ruin. Creech has long been held to have swindled the poet, and Burns
hated him so much an eyewitness once found him in Leith Walk, with a
broken branch over his shoulder, shouting: ''I'm going up to smash that
shite Creech.'' Creech was later made Lord Provost of Edinburgh.
Henry Mackenzie, as Dundas's personal propagandist, was an Edinburgh
lawyer who wrote a lisping novel and became a critic. In his own house
he helped Creech swindle Burns out of the priceless copyright of his
poems (which would have kept the poet in comfort for all his days) for
only 100 guineas. Mackenzie was given the lucrative post of Comptroller
of Taxes for Scotland. Three of his sons were bunged sinecures in the
East India Company.
In 1828 a 150ft statue to Henry Dundas was completed in St Andrew
Square, Edinburgh, overlooking the lawyer's office in which Burns was
tricked into signing his farm lease. It is an infinitely more poisonous
remembrance of our concealed past than the statue of the Duke of
Sutherland which has caused so much recent outrage, and should have been
demolished years ago.

0Johannesburg, Friday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela and his deputy F W de Klerk said today that
they had resolved a crisis threatening to break up South Africa's
Government of national unity.
''We met to discuss the serious situation which has developed within
the Government of national unity . . . Our discussion succeeded in
clearing up the misunderstandings with regard to all the specific
relevant issues and in re-establishing mutual trust and confidence,''
the leaders said in a joint statement.
''In the spirit of serving the best interests of the country as a
whole, we have agreed to make a fresh start which will help us to avoid
a repetition of the situation that arose earlier this week in the
Cabinet.''
The crisis arose over a decision by the Government, now dominated by
Mandela's African National Congress (ANC), that immunity from
prosecution for apartheid crimes for two former Ministers and 3500
policemen had never been granted under the formerly white-run government
headed by de Klerk.
Later Mandela and de Klerk appeared in a joint news conference in
which the former apartheid leader said he would have withdrawn from the
coalition Government had they failed to patch up their differences.
''If our discussion this morning did not achieve what it was meant to
achieve, then I would have been facing the press on the basis, in all
probability, that the National Party had withdrawn from the Government
of national unity,'' de Klerk said.
The row over indemnities erupted last week when Justice Minister
Dullah Omar said the former Cabinet Ministers and policemen had been
granted indemnity in the weeks before the historic all-race elections
last April, which brought Mandela to power. The ANC-led Cabinet
yesterday decided that immunity had not been granted.
The party had accused de Klerk's regime of trying to cover up human
rights abuses by wanting indemnity for the policemen, their former
Minister Adriaan Vlok, and former Defence Minister Magnus Malan.
South African policemen, Vlok and Malan were often accused of running
anti-ANC hit squads and dirty tricks departments against blacks in the
1980s and early 1990s.
De Klerk said similar amnesties were granted to several thousand ANC
members and accused Mandela's party of setting double standards, adding
that he had been insulted at this week's Cabinet meeting.
At the conference, however, de Klerk said their summit had restored
his confidence in Mandela.
''In the process of the confrontation, my confidence in the president
was shaken, and our talk this morning achieved the restoration of that
confidence,'' de Klerk told reporters.
''From both sides we will find it possible to work together as
opposing parties within a government of national unity to achieve joint
goals we have set ourselves in our country.
He added: ''I hope this fresh start will augur well for the people of
South Africa.''
Mandela said he and de Klerk were working hard to restore the
confidence in each other which led up to South Africa's peaceful
transition to democracy.
''We shouldn't look back and reopen these scars,'' he said.
The president said differences were inevitable between different
political parties in the coalition government.
The National Party is a junior partner of the ANC.
De Klerk said yesterday that ANC Ministers had ''viciously insulted''
him and his party over the issue of indemnity for politically-motivated
crimes and their attitude to a programme of reconstruction and
development.
Mandela and de Klerk said after their meeting today: ''We wish to
express our acceptance of one another's good faith and
integrity.''--Reuter.

Kurt Russell is an all-action man of the screen -- and in real life,
too. And he makes no aplogies for it, he tells namesake (but, alas, no
relation) William Russell.
AS A white European male I had to ask. Kurt Russell's surname really
is Russell. It could, Hollywood being Hollywood, have been Kowalski or
just about anything you care to imagine. But Kurt Russell is a real
Russell. We could even be related, he said. The family came from England
originally. I said I thought not, since I came from Scotland. As for
white European males, Kurt does not hold them in high esteem, but he is
all man. Not a macho man, you understand, as somebody rashly suggested.
''I thought macho was a Spanish term for a man who wanted to be manly,''
he said coldly. Kurt doesn't want to be manly. Kurt is. And so are the
characters he plays.
''The ones I find myself drawn to are men I can relate to and I think
they are clear about who they are,'' he said. ''They don't have a lot of
questions about what they are supposed to do. They have deep
complexities they don't know how to deal with -- that is what is heroic
about them -- but they try to go on with each day, as I do in my life. I
go on even if I am not 100 per cent sure of what I am supposed to do.''
Kurt, in the business for 35 years -- he started as a child actor in
1961 and made his name in the mini series, Elvis, playing the King -- is
in Britain to publicise his latest muscleman adventure film, Stargate.
He thinks white European men are downtrodden and should stand up for
themselves. Nor does he think it should be a problem for society that he
likes to fly aeroplanes, sail boats, hunt or fish, all things he grew up
doing and saw his father, grandfather, and uncles do. It is a matter of
what you enjoy being.
''I never look at my life or acting as trying to live up to
something,'' he said. ''A man should be true to himself. Homosexuality
is interesting. Some great men I know are five-feet-off-the-ground gay
guys but they are men. They are true to themselves. They don't back away
from their feelings. They are not afraid to express who they are. I know
men who are extremely physical in stature and who are just wimps, a
waste of time, not men. I would not bet on that kind of guy for five
seconds.''
Was his attitude something to do with his roots, with America being a
frontier country and men being closer to a frontier tradition? If I was
saying Americans were more primitive than a lot of European, then yes.
Nothing Kurt does is dangerous because he knows what he is doing. He got
quite shirty when someone asked if Goldie Hawn, the mother of his
children, ever worried about what he was doing.
You stood twice as much chance of getting killed in a horse-drawn
carriage than in his aeroplane, and a three or four times better chance
of being struck by lightning on the ground, he said. When he was in a
dangerous situation he knew what to do about it. Goldie had asked about
his offshore boat racing. Was it fun for him, was it important to him?
She had to know. He realised that because they were not having fun it
was not fun for him to go on and gave it up. He got a great kick out of
his family and there were better things to do, he said. But he did not
give up flying. They shared in that.
Then he recounted a number of near-death experiences he had while
flying, while racing his motor car, and while playing a fireman in
Backdraft opposite Robert De Niro, all of which seemed to prove that
what he liked doing was dangerous. But being a man, he had lived to tell
the tale. And anyway death came to everyone in the end. He likened it to
a wave crashing on the shore. All that energy it released moved into
something else. That would happen to him.
In Stargate he plays a tough army colonel who leads a band of soldiers
through a star gate, a kind of time lock, which transports them to
another planet inhabited by ancient Egyptians taken there by an alien
life force. It had come to earth, assumed human form, turned into the
Sun god Ra, and taught them to do all the things people wonder how they
managed to do. It is pure hokum and special effects in the middle of
which Kurt, no stranger to this kind of movie, squares his jaw, flashes
his piercing blue eyes, ignores a ghastly military-style crew cut -- in
real life he has flowing, well-barbered locks -- and saves the day for
America.
No, he was not worried about being overwhelmed by special effects,
although such pictures were very difficult to do. ''Go back to
Hitchcock,'' he said. ''He knew everything he was going to do in his
films. They were made before the cameras rolled. Movies like Stargate
are riskier. They tell you there will be a star gate and you have to
trust them. It is a bit like going to war. Whatever gets in the way you
have to gallop through.''
His films are not short of the odd fight scene, so I wondered how he
felt about screen violence. ''To me violence and sex come into the same
category,'' he said. ''If a movie is good the audience has no problem. I
saw La Reine Margot the other day. Look at the violence in that. Did you
have any problems? No? Because it is well done. Look at Under Siege.
Also violent. Not done very well. It is up to us to do it right.
''I tell my kids when they are watching things like that: 'the only
thing that hurts me is you think this is good'.''
Even a downtrodden white European male has to admit it -- Kurt is
quite a guy.

Once the bell goes, the toil and sweat are forgotten as one man
becomes the focus of the boxer's attention. Ninian Dunnett reports from
the ringside.
WE'RE probably not slow to point out the successes of our wee hard men
in the boxing ring. The names of Scotland's world-beaters live on in
national folklore -- Benny Lynch, Jackie Paterson, Walter McGowan, Jim
Watt and the greatest of them all: Ken Buchanan, who in 1970 was voted
best boxer in the world (ahead of Muhammad Ali) by New York journalists.
It was a Scottish aristocrat, Sir John Sholto Douglas -- the eighth
Marquis of Queensberry -- who formulated the basic rules of the modern
fight game. Some 130 years later, a new generation of Scots is emerging
from our 150 amateur boxing clubs to challenge for world titles. Among
the thousands of young men hoping to follow the likes of Clinton, Weir,
Docherty, and Jacobs to success are Gerard and Lawrence Murphy, who
train at the relatively new Forgewood ABC in Motherwell. In Dublin
recently they became the first and second Scots to win the Under-17
Golden Gloves amateur title at their weights.
Gerard Murphy, 17, boxes at light welterweight.
G M: ''One day I'll turn pro, and I believe that I'll be a world
champion at I don't know how many weights. I don't like saying it to my
pals -- they don't think I'm big-headed but I've always thought this
way, and it's got stronger recently.
''I've had 35 fights without a loss. And when you get into the ring,
the other boy's saying -- well I'm good enough to beat him. And it's a
danger to your record, it makes you more determined.
''But a boxer's life is basically training. The lads at the gym are
very good; it's only open three nights a week, but if we're training for
championships or something they'll open it up for us. And you do feel
really good when you're at your fullest fitness. You're jumping out of
your skin. You feel more pain when you're sparring than in a contest,
because when you're in the fight, you're focused; but a punch to the
belly that takes the wind out of you, that's when you feel it.
''The Bellshill Speaker, the local paper, follows us quite a lot, and
we've got a wee scrapbook. And now and again when I'm out, people say
hiya to me, but I don't know them, or you might get a couple of people
trying to start trouble. But most of the time you succeed in talking
your way out of it.''
A district ranger for Motherwell District Council, 47-year-old Michael
Murphy trains his two sons for the ring.
M M: ''I was quite late in starting boxing -- 24 -- but I got a lot of
knowledge from Joe Aitchison at Dalmarnock Boxing Club. He was probably
the greatest trainer in Britain at one time; he trained John Caldwell,
who won a world title, and even had a hand in helping to train Benny
Lynch. Plus I had a lot of ideas of my own, and these are just coming to
fruit now.
''I trained the boys from when they were wee laddies, mainly because
it's a very rough area we live in. But I'm only there to help them while
they're doing it. I wouldnae be peeved if they wanted to stop; it's too
hard to do even if you want to do it. We came here two seasons ago, the
lads here built the place up from scratch in the dilapidated huts of Our
Lady's High annexe, and it's now one of the best-equipped clubs in
Scotland.
''Scotland has got quite a lot of talent coming up at the moment, but
they don't have the same facilities or conditions as English or Irish
boxers. It's time-consuming and it's hard. And it can cost a lot of
money; the boys go through mitts and boots like nothing on earth, which
can cost #100 a pair.
''My wife doesnae go to see the boys fighting. She gets far too
excited, she screams and that, she cannae control herself. So she's
banned from the contests.''
Lawrence Murphy, 18, is studying quality management at Bell College in
Hamilton. He fights at light-middleweight.
L M: ''Fighting in front of a crowd was a big step for me. I remember
it clearly. More than the actual fight, it was the feelings before --
walking up and hearing the crowd shouting, and shaky legs, butterflies
in the stomach, all these feelings. The nerves never go away, but they
do change a bit; you're able to psych yourself up, you become excited.
''But a fight's only nine minutes, and the training's an awful lot
more pain and exhaustion. During the summer I'd be getting up at the
back of five and running about eight miles, come home, go to work,
finish about four, come home, get an abdominal work session, footwork
practice, and shadow boxing, and then to the gym at night.
''But fighting's improved my confidence. I can now walk into a place
feeling that I've done things I couldn't possibly have done without it.
I've travelled all over Europe -- in the last year to Turkey, Greece,
Ireland, Wales. And when you get that feeling standing up in the ring
and your name's announced as the winner -- it's an amazing feeling. It
makes up for all those nights when you've missed out and your friends
have been going on somewhere, but you've got to get to bed. I really
can't see that I could ever be away from it now.''

As Roy Jenkins served to 'break the mould' in 1982, Britain did battle
with Argentina -- and it wasn't football, as David Belcher discovers.
IN THE gruff and semi-embarrassed way that footballers always seem to
carry out these public-relations chores, Scotland's World Cup 22 carried
national pride into the UK chart arena as well as they carried a tune --
bluntly. ''We have a dream,'' they sang in level tones, avoiding
outrageous medal-winning predictions as they sought to erase our
nightmare memories of the Argentina World Cup campaign of 1978. It was
1982, the year in focus on tomorrow night's edition of Time Of Your Life
on Scottish Television.
But as the photographs on this page reveal, our day-to-day existence
is more surely affected by a sport that's deadlier than the
life-and-death game of football: politics.
Mrs Thatcher decided to treat us to a dam' good war -- sorry, a dam'
good conflict against Johnny Argie in the far-off Falklands. Sundry
disaffected Labour Party bods opted to ''break the mould'' of the
post-war British parliamentary party system, starting most famously with
a by-election victory in Glasgow's West End. Workers at British
Leyland's Bathgate factory staged a sit-in over plans to axe tractor
production.
Time Of Your Life will also be delving into the film archives to
present news from 1982's religious front: Pope John Paul II visited
Scotland, and oor ain Muriel Gray began preaching from her self-penned
gospel of St Spikey when she made her telly debut on The Tube.
Musically, Altered Images began to wind down just as Eurythmics got
into their stride. The former can be heard during tomorrow night's
programme imploring us to See Those Eyes; the latter warn that Love Is A
Stranger.
Sadly, the Associates reached what was to prove their peak with Party
Fears Two and Love Hangover. Not a vintage year for Scottish music,
1982, though. Not with Ultravox's synth-pomp and the pained squalling of
PhD ruling the airwaves.
But we can be thankful for small mercies. Midge Ure was eventually
unseated from his place in public life just as surely as Roy Jenkins.

A SCOTTISH charity worker being held hostage in Sierra Leone has
spoken by radio to his employers and told them he misses his family, but
is otherwise bearing up well.
Calum Murray, 25, from Stornoway, and Londoner Robert D'Cruz, 30, have
been held for three months after being kidnapped by the Revolutionary
United Forces in the north of the country.
They managed to make radio contact with their employers, Voluntary
Service Overseas, yesterday from the camp where they are being held.
The news comes as two more Britons were seized by rebels in the West
African state. Personnel manager Peter White and security officer Andrew
Young work for Sierra Rutile, a US-Australian backed titanium mining
company which is Sierra Leone's biggest private-sector employer.
It is about 15 miles from Monkaji, where two other Britons, named by
the British High Commission as James Westwood and Ross Milne, were among
eight European mining workers seized from a Swiss bauxite mine on
Thursday.
All six Britons who have gone missing since October are believed to
have been kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front, a shadowy group
with no clear political aims.
The rebels have threatened to kill the new hostages unless the British
and other governments stop arming Sierra Leone's military regime.
The death threat was contained in a message addressed to the British
High Commission in the capital and was delivered by Sheila Westwood,
wife of kidnapped mine manager James Westwood.
''They have made certain demands, which they say must be met or they
will kill hostages, foreigners and British citizens in particular,'' one
diplomat said.
Mr Murray and Mr D'Cruz, who were repairing flood-damaged roads when
they were seized last October, said they were healthy, in good spirits,
but missing their families. They appreciated the efforts being made to
secure their release, said the VSO's spokesman, Blake Lee-Howard.
''This is excellent news,'' he said of the radio contact. ''We have
had many eye-witness accounts to say they were well, but this is the
first time we have spoken to them and known for definite who is holding
them.''
Mr Murray's mother, Mrs Katie Ann Murray, who runs the Post Office at
the village of Gress in Lewis, said: ''It's great news that radio
contact has been made and it is good to know that they are both well and
being well treated. It is an answer to prayer.''
The charity now plans to use the open radio channel for continued
negotiations with the RFU, who allege the two men are military advisers.
Mr Murray's brother, Iain, said there might now be a chance of them
making contact directly with Calum.
''We are very, very happy. This is the first contact since he was
taken. He said they were safe and well and were being well looked after.
I suppose they have to say that, but it is great just to know they are
still alive. They seem to be in good shape.''
The Foreign Office last night warned UK travellers not to visit Sierra
Leone, where Britain is the former colonial power.
Foreign Office Minister Baroness Chalker said the latest events were a
source of great concern.
''We remain in close touch with the Sierra Leonean authorities who are
doing their best in a confused and fluid situation. Our primary concern
remains the safe and early release of those held as well as the safety
of the British community,'' she said.
About 500 British workers are believed to be in Sierra Leone, which in
1992 was listed by the UN as the world's worst place to live.

THE Government will not change its policies to appease the Tory
Euro-rebels, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said yesterday. He dismissed
as ''unreal'' some of the proposals in the statement of aims published
on Thursday by eight of the rebels.
He said that, if adopted, they could lead to Britain pulling out of
the European Union. He could not tell from the statement if this was
what the rebels really wanted.
His comments contrasted sharply with those of Treasury Chief Secretary
Jonathan Aitken, one of the Cabinet's most prominent Euro-sceptics, who
said some of the rebel proposals were close to mainstream Government
thinking.
''There are ideas there which I think are unreal in the sense that if
we push them, we would be in fact withdrawing from the European Union,
cutting ourselves off from the single market or putting ourselves under
rules we didn't have any share in making,'' Mr Hurd told Radio 4's The
World At One.
He also took a firm line on restoring the party whip to the rebels,
saying it was up to those who had lost it to make clear they wanted it
back.
His comments suggest that Ministers remain deeply divided on how to
deal with the on-going problem posed by the rebels.
On Monday, the Prime Minister, in a Downing Street news conference,
took a noticeably more conciliatory line, predicting that they would be
brought back into the party fold.
Since then Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Environment Secretary John
Gummer -- both strong pro-Europeans -- have made statements advocating a
much tougher stance.

Lebanon is slowly regaining its reputation as the garden of the Middle
East. And, says Catherine Brown, its produce means a rich harvest for
adventurous cooks.
Red, yellow, and green peppers and a bunch of spring onions are
decorating a large plate in the centre of the table. Also bowls of humus
and aubergine puree, plus a small sharp knife, which has been provided
for slicing the peppers into dipping sticks. This is the Middle East:
but where? The idea that there is a collective Middle Eastern style of
cooking, based on dishes which the largest countries have in common, may
be a convenient way of understanding foreign cookery. But it obscures
the differences. It's like saying there's a British style based on
English cooking without explaining Scotland, Ireland and Wales.
We are in Lebanon, by the way, with Anissa Helou; campaigner for her
small country's distinctive style. She left Beirut in the early 70s to
study interior design in London, became an art consultant at Sotheby's,
opened an antique shop in Paris and has advised the Kuwait ruling family
on art collections.
Now she writes, with the help of her mother, Laurice Helou, about her
native food in Lebanese Cuisine.
''From travelling in Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Iran, and the Gulf
countries,'' she says, ''I've found many dishes which are similar.
Stuffed vine leaves are universal in the Middle East. But so are potato
dishes in Europe, yet you can't say there's a common European potato
dish.''
Before the war, when the Beirut women shopped in dark, cluttered
stores filled with canvas sacks of coffee and straw baskets of dates
lying about the floor, fresh fruits and vegetables came from carts in
the streets. The corner food shops were the remnants of a short but
influential period of French occupation from 1920 to 1946.
Lebanon is also unique because it has no desert and no nomadic Bedouin
culinary tradition. Abundant fertile land provides good supplies of
fruits and vegetables, which, along with a shortage of meat, have
encouraged a vegetarian style of eating. Many of the fruits and
vegetables are eaten raw, and in comparison with their neighbours the
people use much less animal fat in cooking, which makes the dishes much
lighter.
Another clue that you are in Lebanon, and not Syria, is the topping of
fried pine nuts on the humus.
AUBERGINE PUREE (Baba Ghannooge)
Ingredients for 4:
3 large aubergines, pricked with fork
3 tablespoons tahini (sesame seed paste)
2 garlic cloves, crushed
Juice of 1 lemon
Salt to taste
Garnish:
Flat-leafed parsley and pomegranate seeds or paprika
Extra virgin olive-oil
Method: Grill the aubergines on all sides until slightly charred,
leave to cool. While still warm, open up and scrape out insides into the
blender. Add other ingredients and blend to a coarse texture. Remove,
taste for seasoning, and put into a shallow serving dish. Garnish in the
middle with parsley and pomegranate (or paprika). Make a slight hollow
circle round the garnish and fill with olive-oil. Serve with pitta bread
or:
MIXED HERB AND TOASTED BREAD SALAD (Fattosh)
Ingredients for 4:
4 gem lettuces or 1 large cos lettuce
1 bunch spring onions, finely chopped
half a cucumber, skinned and sliced finely
3 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped
7 oz (200 g) flat parsley, on the stalk, coarsely chopped
Half a bunch of mint, coarsely chopped
Dressing:
3 tablespoons sumac (the ground powder of a citric-flavoured berry,
alternatively use lemon juice)
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive-oil
1 pitta bread, opened up and toasted
Method: Discard any outer damaged leaves of lettuce, wash and dry then
slice finely into strips. Put into the salad bowl with the other salad
ingredients. Add the sumac, salt, and olive-oil and toss lightly
together. Taste for seasoning. Tear up the bread into bite-sized pieces
and add to the salad just before serving.
STUFFED VINE LEAVES (Mehshi Wara Enab Bil-Zeyt)
Use the stuffing also for Swiss chard leaves, aubergines, courgettes,
and peppers. Bil-Zeyt means ''in oil'' and is Lebanese for vegetarian.
Time to roll up leaves: 15-20 minutes:
Ingredients for 4:
5oz (150 g) white, short-grain rice
2-3 finely diced tomatoes
Half a bunch of spring onions, finely chopped
4 oz (125 g) parsley, medium-finely chopped
2 oz (50 g) mint, medium-finely chopped
2 heaped tablespoons sumac (or lemon juice)
Quarter teaspoon each ground cinnamon, black pepper
Half a teaspoon ground allspice
Salt to taste
Juice of 1 lemon (optional, if you use sumac)
5 fl oz/150 ml extra virgin olive-oil
7 oz pack preserved vine leaves
l large potato and 1 large tomato, peeled and sliced
Method: Mix all the stuffing ingredients together, taste for
seasoning. Rinse vine leaves in a colander with boiling water.
To roll the stuffing: place a heaped teaspoonful on the rough side
about half an inch from the stem. Shape into a line no thicker than your
little finger. Fold in the sides, tapering a little towards the tip of
the leaf. Then fold the stem edge over the stuffing and roll up loosely,
leaving space for rice to expand.
Line a pan with the potato and tomato slices and place stuffed vine
leaves on top. Swirl some water round the stuffing bowl and pour over
leaves to just cover. Place a plate on top to prevent them uncurling and
simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the rice is cooked. Serve with
the potatoes and tomatoes, some wedges of lemon and Toasted Bread Salad.

JAMMU: The death toll in the Kashmir avalanche disaster remained
unclear yesterday. Early police figures had indicated 110 deaths, while
the United News of India agency reported that 140 people had died and
130 were missing.
However the Indian Government, in its first official statement since
the avalanches struck the remote Himalayan highway between Srinagar and
Jammu last Saturday, played down the scale of the tragedy, saying about
60 people had died and rescue operations were well under way.
It said hundreds of people had probably saved themselves by taking
refuge in the Banihal tunnel. More than 4500 people have been rescued so
far.

THE laconic entries of Hugh Johnson's Pocket Wine Book are to be
depended on. Under Fetzer in the Californian section it has a couple of
lines of text ending with: ''A byword for value''. Tom Stevenson in the
much larger Sotheby's World Wine Encyclopedia (of which there is a new
paperback edition from Dorling Kindersley for #17.99) makes the same
point: ''Fetzer has built up a reputation for exceptional
value-for-money wines''.
It might be added that all the wines are made as organic wines but
have managed to avoid that heaviness, even muggy quality, that attends
to many such well-intentioned creations.
A half-bottle of Fetzer's Valley Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon can be had at
Glasgow's Cafe Gandolfi for #5.60. That is a tempting price in a
restaurant, especially at lunchtime when a glass and a half for two,
which is as much as a half-bottle offers, is enough for people who have
to go back to work. The quality of the wine is far greater than is
suggested by the price.
It is a full and tasty red with a warm cab personality, lots of fruit
evident from the first mouthful, but a well-structured wine with a good
finish. Its balance is good and there is a pleasing mineral complexity,
but it must be one of the easiest of red wines to drink.
There are lots of Fetzers about. It is the sixth-largest winery in the
US. It makes wine in bulk (two years ago it produced 2,000,000 cases)
and across a range of grapes including Fume Blanc (a Sauvignon blanc but
in the smoky style pioneered by Robert Mondavi), Zinfandel (a grape
peculiar to California), two Cabernets and two Chardonnays. A Merlot is
due to appear anytime: like many in the wine industry the Fetzer's
winemaker, Paul Dolan, forecasts a great future for this appealing
grape, and his wine from it will be worth looking for.
Oddbins have Fetzers but so do many other outlets, and acceptance that
they are good value follows the first taste. I tried those available in
the UK late last summer (and had been impressed by the earlier Fetzers,
particularly Gewurztraminer and Riesling, available here before the reds
about 10 years ago).
Of the wines mentioned above only the Fume Blanc failed to impress me
very much, possibly because I have become too used to the Mondavi wine
which is more concentrated and intense (but also a good deal dearer).
The Sundial Chardonnay is memorable wine and the Zinfandel very big. The
price range of Fetzer wines does pierce #10 but most are well below
that. Buy with confidence.

IT'S just over 100 years since a special flask designed to retain the
temperatures of liquid was designed by British scientist Sir James
Dewar, at first used only in the laboratory. It fell to Dewar's Germany
glass-blowing expert to patent the design in 1903 and the brand name
Thermos Flask was born (the name coming from Therme, the Greek for
heat).
In the 1920s there was a rage for outdoor picnics. The Second World
War saw a boom for vacuum flasks for the armed forces. But the Thermos
Flask (like Hoover the name has become generic, much to the chagrin of
Thermos Ltd) looked tired and old and, over the years, has lost a lot of
its initial cachet. But vacuum flasks are back in vogue used as much to
keep things cold as hot.
Flasks have long been big in Europe and now new designs are around
that will scotch forever memories of ready-mixed instant coffee (with
milk and sugar already added) sipped in a chilly lay-by or on childhood
holiday trips.
The new vacuum flasks come in vivid colours and wonderful bulbous
shapes. Two British designers, Musgrove and Brown, have come up with a
new spin for a piece of forgotten tableware: the Alfi Flask.
''I've discovered that there's quite a healthy market for flasks like
these and they are coming back into everyday use,'' says Andy Harrold,
of Nice House.
The brightly coloured plastic, with the familiar mirrored glass tube
inside, are German-made. ''Designers and manufacturers are becoming more
adventurous with plastics,'' explains Harrold.
The American architect Michael Graves has even designed a vacuum
flask. The Euclid flask (named after the Greek geometrician) is, not
surprisingly, robust in looks and materials and comes in contrasting
colour combinations.

THE Prince of Wales's valet Ken Stronach last night seemed likely to
pay the penalty for betraying his master's trust.
The senior valet looked set to lose his #12,000-a-year job after he
admitted to royal officials that he took sneak photographs at Prince
Charles's Highgrove home and talked to a Sunday newspaper.
However, as an injunction restraining Mr Stronach from further
discussing his 15 years of service in the prince's household was granted
in the High Court, St James's Palace held back from immediately sacking
him.
It was understood ''the question of his employment'' would be resolved
next week.
The prince's private secretary Commander Richard Aylard began an
inquiry into Mr Stronach's actions after intimate details of the affair
between Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles appeared in the News of
the World last Sunday.
Mr Stronach told Cmdr Aylard that he ''did not recognise statements
attributed to him'' by the paper, and ''categorically denied'' that the
majority of the incidents he allegedly described took place.
The News of the World disputed his version of the two-hour
conversation with its royal correspondent and stood by its story.
Now the 50-year-old valet faces losing his job, his grace and favour
home, and his car.
* The Sun has promised to return family photographs taken from the
home of Mrs Parker Bowles after the couple attacked the paper for
invading their privacy.
The paper, which published several pages of family pictures on Monday,
also agreed to give to charity the #25,000 which would have been paid to
the paper's source, according to solicitors for the Parker Bowleses.

CROSSWORD enthusiasts are very dedicated people. Some cannot function
throughout the day if they do not first complete the challenge over
breakfast. Others believe that the pinnacle of intellectual achievement
is not only finishing a crossword but inventing one in the first place.
A crossword, surely, is something you do with Granny and a scone and
jam. Or when you're ill. But heck no, it's a whole culture. This week
the Public Jury wonder why.
Nah, I never do crosswords. I can't be bothered thinking. (Mimi
Curran, PA)
You need to be able to spell to do crosswords, otherwise it's too
easy. (Ailsa Miller, accountant)
They take up too much time. (Jim Leckie, shop owner)
While attending a weekend conference in Crieff last year, I discovered
a secret/abtruse/cabbalistic/covert/cryptic
clique/coterie/clan/clamjamfry/cenacle. We discussed, digested,
cogitated (thanks Lloyd!) the deeper meanings of The Wee
Stinker/fetor/malodour/mephitis. One lady admitted to being the owner of
a Wee Stinker T-shirt, but wore it only at bedtime to avoid
retribution/lex talionis/revanche or -- (3,3,3). (Myra M Pater, Herald
Crossword enthusiast, Bishopbriggs)
Oh, they're splendid, they keep you quick. Like bridge, crosswords
help you keep mentally active. (Brenda Harris, retired)
I've never managed to complete one. (Tony Meechan, amateur footballer)
Crosswords are crap. (Malcolm, 12)
I think the people who make up crosswords are all thick. I mean, it's
all wordplay, isn't it? (Gillian Copeland, maths student)
I don't even understand the clues. (Mrs Polly Leeson, housewife)
I think it was Martin Bell's father who compiled the first crossword
for the Times. He used to put a bit of paper on the basket of his bike
and took it from there. You lift them and lay them. Experts can do them
in a hour and a half. A crossword is first and foremost a literary
puzzle. British puzzles are allusions to what people have read. People
who do crosswords tend to be well-read. You don't necessarily need a
high IQ. (Myops)

<TEXT>
A FORMER solicitor jailed for a multi-million pound mortgage fraud has
a secret fortune to look forward to on his release, said the judge who
sentenced him to six years yesterday.
Most of the #8m which passed through David Sachs' clients' account
after being conned from building societies has never been recovered.
Wood Green Crown Court in north London heard that Sachs, 50, a ''prime
mover'' in a deception which raised cash to develop a museum dedicated
to Sherlock Holmes, had deliberately prevented investigators tracking
down the money.
The former advocate was struck off by the Law Society for what Judge
David Martineau described as a ''very serious'' fraud.
The judge said Sachs, of The Green, Stowmarket, Suffolk, had ''salted
away'' around #7.5m.
Sachs admitted one count of conspiracy to defraud and one of obtaining
property by deception.
The fraud -- involving bogus identities, bank accounts in false names,
fictional references, and multiple applications on properties -- was
brought to a halt by a ''sharp eyed'' building society manager in 1991.
Property developer John Skok, 35, of Park Avenue South, Crouch End,
London, and mortgage broker Liam Leroy, 35, of Eastlake Road,
Camberwell, London, were both jailed for three-and-a-half years after
admitting conspiracy to defraud.
John Aidiniantz, 37, of Cadogan Lane, Belgravia, London, was jailed
for three years and ordered to pay #30,000 costs for eight charges of
obtaining a total of #1.2m by deception. He had denied the offences.
Solicitor William Eaglen, 46, of Chestnut Grove, Balham, south London,
who carried out conveyancing for some of the applications, was given a
two-year sentence for conspiracy to defraud.

Anvar Khan visits the ongoing exhibition at Discovery Point, Dundee,
which charts the story of Scott and the Antarctic pioneers.
THE Antarctic is the last place on earth, in the sense that
civilisation hasn't yet arrived. Men have tried to scratch its thick,
primeval hide with the strength of their own bravery and character, but
the lumpen and obtuse nature of this wild ungovernable element reigns.
The Antarctic sits at the top of the world, like icing on a Christmas
pud. You can't gatecrash. Like Hades, it has its own bouncer, its own
Cerberus. Sub-zero temperatures.
Things are never what they seem, a man who knows something you don't
can sit squat on your little dreams. The last place on earth has a
backward, unevolved-looking oasis of sea creatures, fish, who
spontaneously produce an anti-freeze a million times more powerful than
current concoctions. This is the Antarctic's surprise attack, its
defence against the tabloid reporters of the homosapient mass.
Captain Robert Falcon Scott thought he could play David to the South
Pole's Goliath. Some have said he was an amateur. He was not, certainly,
a veteran explorer like William Parry or John Ross before him. He was
green -- as naive as anyone who tries to navigate through undiscovered
country.
On his first expedition to the Antarctic in 1902, to gauge the
magnetism of the earth, Scott and his crew had a bloody miserable time,
as the ongoing exhibition at Discovery Point, Dundee, where the ship of
the same name is tethered all year round for public perusal, reveals,
probably unintentionally.
In the Scientific Research and Exploration section there is a
snowcapped glass box showcasing a scaled-down version of Scott's camp.
The ship Discovery is frozen into the ice, lopsided with embarrassment.
The figures of Reginald Coettlitz, surgeon and botanist, Edward Wilson,
zoologist and artist, Thomas Hodgson, marine biologist, Hartley Ferrar,
geologist, and Louis Bernacchi, the physicist, are going about their
scientific business on a simulated snowy landscape.
And there's the noise pollution, the constant aggravation of a droning
wind, relentless and depressing. Captain Scott reminded me of Macbeth,
whose ambition made him a fool, stuck in a place pitch-black for half
the year, occasionally lacerated with meteorites, the tail end of the
broomsticks which prophesied his doom.
Captain Scott was a lieutenant when he wrote to Sir Clements Markham,
president of the Royal Geographic Society, expressing an enthusiastic
desire to lead the Antarctic exploration. The selection of Scott over
and above others of experience and rank has never been justified. He had
no special skills for a unique exercise which guaranteed danger. His
team consisted of other Navy men because he had ''grave doubts'' about
being able to work with ''any other class of men''. And scientists.
Scott led a group of geniuses; he didn't have to be one himself. His
job, surely, was as manager, making sure the line of common sense was
towed. He was a prime minister, the organiser of a brain bank, not its
inspiration. But it's not what you say, it's what you do. Scott died in
1912 during his second trip to the Antarctic, trying to beat the
Norwegian Roald Amundsen to the South Pole. He failed.
It was cold in the auditorium as the film of events unfolded.
Discovery Point, in fact, is air-conditioned to freeze visitors into a
genuine appreciation of climactic conditions. They were dour souls,
these pioneers. Sir Clements Markham came across as a grasping fat cat
eager to share the spoils of success but not the work, and Scott as a
would-be James Bond who fancied the challenge because it might make him
more attractive to women.
The ship, Discovery, itself has been revamped. The hull was open on
the day of my visit, revealing a whalebone corset of wood: layers of
English oak, pitch pine, green heart, and Riga fir. Given its two years
in constricting Antarctic ice, the base of the ship never cracked.
Indeed, there was much celebration on its return to Dundee that upon
examination it had not even gone mouldy.
But the star of this comprehensive exhibition is the baddie, the
culprit, the murderer. In the modern section there is an anvil of
Antarctic ice in a glass case, in its own environment of minus 94
degrees. It's a reminder of what man attempted to fight. A shuffling
stream of visitors stop to pay their respects, their eyes popping in
awe.

STRATHCLYDE Regional Council has submitted a formal planning
application to Glasgow District Council for the building of a #200m
extension of the M74, linking the motorway with the M8 in the south of
the city.
The extension, which would stretch for 4.8 miles from Fullarton Road
in the East End to just south of the Kingston bridge, would reduce
congestion in the centre and east of Glasgow, according to council
officials.
However, it would not come without a price for local communities. Two
churches, seven listed industrial buildings, 100 commercial properties,
and 27 houses or flats would have to be demolished.
Compensation to the owners of such properties and the compulsory
purchase of land would add about #50m to the cost.
The plans, which form the second phase of the extension of the M74
from the Maryville Interchange at the south end of the M73 to the M8 at
Kingston, will also be strongly opposed by environmental groups.
They claim that recent evidence -- including that of the Government's
own Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment -- shows that
building urban motorways engenders more traffic instead of solving
congestion.
The three-lane motorway would be completed in about five years if the
plans were accepted by Glasgow district, whose planning committee is
expected to make a decision by about June.
However, the final decision could rest with the Scottish Office, which
will probably take over responsibility for the funding and construction
after local government reorganisation.
The planning application has been timed to precede local government
reorganisation so that the specifications and alignment of the road
agreed by Glasgow District Council -- if it gives the go-ahead -- will
have to be adhered to.
The region's roads chairman, Councillor Charles Gordon, felt it was
important that council members elected for their local knowledge should
assess the detail of the route.
Strathclyde regions believe the extension would remove 90,000 vehicles
a day from the city's surface streets, particularly in the East End and
in the Rutherglen area where traffic flows in Main Street would be
expected to be halved.
It says the extension would also reduce flows on the M8 between
Baillieston and Charing Cross in the city centre, which is often
congested, by about 30,000 vehicles a day.
Travel time on the city's roads would, the council forecasts, be
reduced by a fifth overall with an average of 10 minutes saved for each
journey.
0 An economic development report drafted by consultants Ove Arup also
concludes that the extension would bring ''moderate to major'' long-term
benefits by attracting increased investment to the area and improving
accessibility to facilities such as Glasgow Airport and the Mossend
Eurofreight terminal.
Mr Jack Steele, project manager of Strathclyde Roads, said the
extension, which would follow the main Glasgow-London railway line for
most of its route, would also allow the council to treat 35 contaminated
land sites.
Under the plans, a total of 27 residential properties would require to
be demolished -- including the whole of George Gray Street, which was
named after a former Rutherglen town clerk who died in 1923 -- and about
100 commercial properties would have to be relocated.
One resident of George Gray Street, Mr William MacMillan, 24, who is
unemployed, said he would be reluctant to leave a ''nice, quiet area''.
Neighbour Thomas Turner, 25, a machine operater at Linpac in
Easterhouse, said he would be pleased to be relocated somewhere which
did not suffer from so many burglaries.
Tenements in Eglinton Street and flats in Turiff Street would also
have to be demolished, as would the A-Listed Eglinton Engine Works in
West Street, the Hermand Street Baptist Church, and the Pentecostal
Church in Cathcart Road.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research with Friends of the Earth Scotland,
said the extension would plough more traffic into Glasgow's already
congested streets.
Mr Ian Bogle, chairman of the environmental group Glasgow for People,
said: ''One of the council's arguments is that the plans would solve the
problem of contaminated waste, but we believe that what they propose
will replace one pollution with another in Carmyle, Rutherglen, and
Cambuslang, with tens of thousands of cars spewing out fumes outside
doors every day.''
A consultation exercise to ascertain the views of the public on issues
such as environmental impact will start on Monday and continue for at
least four weeks.

SCOTTISH Homes yesterday announced that rents for its properties are
to rise by an average of #1.54p a week or 4.2% from April 1. The housing
agency said the rise would allow an average investment of just over
#1000 in each of its 4700 houses. The increase will mean that the
average weekly rent is now #35.25p a week. Those who receive housing
benefit, 69.5% of Scottish Homes' tenants, are protected from the
effects of the increase.

KAREN KOREN freely admits that if she's learnt anything during her
long decade of comedy, she's learnt that ''there is no money to be made
in it . . . breaking even is the best you can hope to do''. Naturally,
Karen Koren being Karen Koren -- ie, somewhat of an unstoppable force --
this disheartening knowledge hasn't dissuaded her from staging a million
comedy shows; running a trillion comedy venues; setting up comedy tours;
encouraging countless comedians; promoting comedy in a business sense
and as an art-form.
Karen's latest venture, beginning early next month, is the Gilded
Balloon Comedy Circuit, a Scotland-wide touring network for top
performers from home and abroad. Having established the Gilded Balloon
as the place for stand-up comedy on the Edinburgh Fringe, Karen's
mission is to establish the Gilded Balloon name in Paisley, Aberdeen,
Glasgow, and Dundee.
She knows from costly experience that it won't be easy. She is still
paying, four years on, for her last attempt to strengthen comedy's
year-round presence in Edinburgh. In 1990 she relocated the Gilded
Balloon's administrative facilities and part of its performing capacity,
decamping from the hobo-strewn Cowgate to a more salubrious locale.
''The Counting House was successful in comedy terms, but it was a
dreadful drain on my resources. I simply ran out of money and had to
cease trading before I went bankrupt. It harmed me terribly and I was
very bitter about it at the time. In fact, it's something I'm still
recovering from.
''But in comedy, you've got to spend to recoup. And, apart from a
grant I received from Glasgow council during 1990, comedy isn't
something that ever attracts official funding. To make money, you've got
to move into bigger venues and keep coming up with guaranteed draws. And
there are very few guaranteed draws.''
As Karen has found out at various times, in various places. At
Glasgow's late, lamented Shelter. At Bar Point, Paisley. Additionally,
sponsors have come and sponsors have gone. Nothing, however, can dim
Karen's enthusiasm for comedy and comedians. Not even the fact of having
lost #18,000 during a disastrous three weeks when she took the Gilded
Balloon to London's Shaw Theatre for a season in 1992.
And it's not as though any other Scottish comedy entrepreneur has
provided Karen with an inspiration by blazing a lastingly-successful
trail. Whither indeed the Fool's Paradise circuit? So why does Karen
keep on keeping on? What has driven her over the last eight years as she
has expanded her Fringe commitment from seven shows a day in one venue
to 71 shows a day in seven venues?
''I've been accused of being a mug for comedy, and I probably am. I
just keep thinking that there are enough people who, for a night out,
prefer a laugh and a drink to a disco where you have to chat folks up or
suffer being chatted up.
''That there are enough people who find comedy as fulfilling as a
night at the theatre.''
Something which helps Karen keep going is the fact that many of
comedy's practitioners are as decent off-stage as they are funny
on-stage. ''I firmly believe that the nicest people are the best comics
because that's what comes across when they're performing. Beautiful folk
like Owen O'Neill who go on-stage and tell true stories.''
Ditto the award-winning Phil Kay, whose career Karen has guided since
Phil took his first tottering steps at the Gilded Balloon in 1989.
''There's been loads of London TV interest in Phil throughout the past
two years. At one point Phil was probably the warm-up man that every TV
show in Britain wanted to use. We were getting tons of offers before the
awards, and we get even more now. But when it all began, I took Phil to
one side and asked him if he wanted to get himself a London agent, and
he simply said: 'No, I'm happy with you'.''
And how happy is that, Phil?
''Very. Karen is down-to-earth, realistic. I've had no reason to leave
Karen because she's done all I've ever wanted her to do really well. And
even when the odd thing hasn't gone so well, I'm still able to trust
her.''
Karen's current range of managerial duties includes overseeing the
organisation of a multimedia exhibition featuring the art-work of Phil's
two closest non-comedy friends, his life-partner Diane Main and his
oldest buddy, Toby Webster: Crash opens next Saturday for a three-week
run in the Gilded Balloon's gallery space.
On the previous day, also at the Gilded Balloon, Karen will be
underlining her ongoing support for new comedy, particularly new women's
comedy, with the launch of the Women's Comedy Network, ''an
inexperienced group of six women and one boy who've been rehearsing here
for the past few months. Their shows will be once a fortnight at #1.50
admission to give them the chance of an audience.''
Meanwhile on the TV front, Phil Kay will next be seen on Tuesday
communing with Latin American sun gods -- and with seasoned Radio 1
DJ'ing goddess Annie Nightingale -- in an edition of BBC Scotland's
Ex-S. Unlikely as it might sound, the show will be ''a kind of New Age
travel docu-comedy-mentary'' about a recent total solar eclipse in
Chile. No boring straightforward telly programmes for our Phil.
And the same naturally applies to whatever kind of a Phil Kay TV
comedy show it is that Phil Kay opts to make in his own right, most
probably for Channel 4. Over a year has passed since Phil recorded one
C4 pilot which, for various reasons, didn't work.
''We're being very careful,'' says Karen. ''Phil has such a rapport
with his live audience that transferring that rapport into homes is
going to take a new TV concept, one that doesn't involve a
quiz-show/bright lights backdrop.''
Neither will such flim-flammery be in evidence when Phil hosts a
20-minute BBC2 show about the auld Franco-Scottish alliance on February
18, the day of the Scotland-France rugby international.
This mention of France unintentionally uncovers one of the more
colourful incidents in Karen's very colourful life, a life which got
under way when she ran away from home at 16 to become a fluorescent
go-go dancer in the touring roadshow version of the original pirate
Radio Scotland station. Ever been to France, Karen?
''Oh yes. With Stephen Frost and Mark Arden, the Oblivion Boys, and
Stephen's wife, one bank holiday. You see, I'd got to know the first
wave of London comics through having supported myself for years as a
single parent by working as a barmaid. That led to being combined
bouncer/box-office attendant/MC and stage manager at an Edinburgh jazz
club which did comedy.
''Anyway, there was this weekend when the four of us, as I've said,
set off by train to Paris . . . and I started the holiday by getting so
pissed that I crawled under the train-carriage to retrieve the bottle of
vodka I'd dropped as the train stood at the platform at Waterloo.''
A typically no-nonsense Korenian act of derring-do, if you don't mind
me mentioning it.
''I bloody well do mind, David!''
Oops. Do you worry that folk find you a bit awe-inspiring . . . nay,
scarey?
''I'm renowned for my temper, aren't I? Aggression without
assertiveness. She said sweetly.''
Well, we have noticed that not every Gilded Balloon staff member lasts
the whole three weeks of the Fringe.
''Actually, at this stage of my life I don't care what others think of
me. I care what Phil thinks of me. I care what people close to me
think.''
I've learnt not to get so close that you can reach over and bat me
round the head, Karen . . . but I do think you're Scottish comedy's best
pal.
* The Gilded Balloon Comedy Circuit begins its first six-week run with
the Umbilical Brothers and Phil Kay at Paisley Arts Centre on Wednesday,
February 8. Each weekend until March 15-19, top acts will be visiting
Paisley (on Wednesdays), Glasgow (Royal Concert Hall, Strathclyde Suite,
Thursdays), Aberdeen (Lemon Tree, Fridays), Dundee (Repertory Theatre,
Saturdays) and Edinburgh (Gilded Balloon, Sundays). Unmissable
performers include Jeremy Hardy, John Shuttleworth, and Alan Davies.

TWO of television's top dramatists have attacked the BBC's network
executives in London for scrapping projects which they were commissioned
to write for BBC Scotland.
Greenock writer Peter McDougall said the decision to axe his
adaptation of Glasgow author Jeff Torrington's novel, Swing Hammer
Swing, was proof that Queen Margaret Drive had no clout and was
''completely and utterly answerable to London''.
Bafta award-winning writer Trevor Preston, who has been told that
plans to make a series of his thriller, The Negotiator, have been
abandoned, accused the corporation of wanting to ''reduce things to the
lowest common denominator and create television for tired bus
conductors''. It was, he said, an insult to the audience.
The shelving of both projects comes less than a year after BBC
Scotland was promised more funds for network drama.
Mr McDougall was enraged at their axing, which was done after BBC
Scotland failed to persuade London to raise the #1.6m budget. He had
been told there was ''a flaw'' in Torrington's book which even his
expertise could not solve.
''I think I know what the 'flaw' is. There's nae car chases. Nothing
that gels with the BBC's current thinking on what makes a film,'' he
said.
Commenting on the cancellation of The Negotiator, the 90-minute pilot
for which was broadcast last year, Preston said: ''The film cost almost
a million, you know. The BBC spent #10,000 on audience research to find
out if the public thought it would make a good series. The overwhelming
majority said it would.''
On the decision to axe Swing Hammer Swing, he said: ''It's a tragedy.
I consider Peter McDougall the finest TV writer in the country. He must
be feeling the same sting I felt when The Negotiator went down the
plughole.''
BBC Scotland expressed its disappointment yesterday that both
programmes had been cancelled. However, it defended its track record in
network drama. A senior official at Queen Margaret Drive disclosed that
they had received final approval from London to make a controversial
90-minute drama for BBC2. Flowers of the Forest, written by Michael
Eaton, is about the conflicts within a social work department in a small
Highland town.
In addition, BBC Scotland had recently completed another one-off
drama, Ruffian Hearts, by the Glasgow writer David Kane, and it would be
announcing two commissions within the next few weeks.
The official added: ''A new series called Hamish Macbeth (about a West
Highland policeman) will be screened in the spring. There is also a
second series of Cardiac Arrest.''
After a speech in Glasgow last year, in which Mr John Birt, the BBC
director-general, admitted that too many programmes were made in London,
BBC Scotland announced a package of measures designed to increase its
output significantly. Among them was a large cash injection to make
network drama.

RESCUERS dug at least seven more survivors from the rubble of Kobe's
earthquake yesterday -- and a pregnant woman who had been pulled out
earlier gave birth to a healthy baby girl.
Yuko Ukon, 33, had been visiting her parents' home in the city when
the earthquake struck before dawn on Tuesday and was trapped under a
chest of drawers that fell as she slept.
But she was lying on her side so that her pelvis took the weight of
the chest, leaving the unborn baby unharmed. She was pulled from the
rubble and gave birth three days later, early yesterday.
All the survivors rescued yesterday were women. Most of them were
elderly and had gone without food or water through three freezing
nights.
The death toll has risen to 4438, with 673 missing.

A TOP bomber in the Provisional IRA and his Scottish accomplice were
yesterday jailed at the Old Bailey.
They used a safe house in a Clackmannanshire village to plan bomb
attacks on London.
The bomber, Robert Fryers, 44, was sentenced to 25 years. He was
caught red-handed on a mission aimed at the City. He broke his silence
in court and claimed he was committed to the cause of peace in Ireland.
The accomplice, Hugh Thomas Jack, 37, was jailed for 20 years for his
role in a campaign which police believe was aimed at Birmingham,
Manchester, and Newcastle as well as London. He will appeal.
The unlikely rural community of Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, was the
centre of what senior officers think was a last-ditch campaign by the
IRA to bring terror to the United Kingdom.
They are convinced that, before announcing the cessation of violence,
the IRA was running out of volunteers, and that the failure of the
campaign based on Sauchie had come as a devastating blow.
More than 100 MI5 agents had converged on the area around Alloa and
Stirling to smash the active service unit. Police from Central Scotland,
Strathclyde, and Scotland Yard were all involved.
Fryers, from Belfast, was caught red-handed with a bomb in a holdall
as he waited to catch a bus into Central London on July 14, 1993.
Jack, known to friends as Tommy or Shug, had provided Fryers with
support and what he thought was a safe haven in Sauchie.
Mrs Justice Ebsworth told them: ''You are both shown to be ruthless
and remorseless men -- prepared to wreak havoc on people's lives, as
well as economic destruction.''
The unanimous verdict by the jury of seven women and five men
exonerated senior police officers from Central Scotland who had been
accused in court of lying and orchestrating a conspiracy to implicate
Jack.
Jack, in a desperate attempt to evade justice, had through his counsel
suggested that a cache of explosive material had been planted by police
in Gartinny wood, near his place of work. That cache was sufficient to
manufacture six more bombs.
Detective Superintendent John Ogg, of Central Scotland Police, said:
''The verdict of the jury clearly demonstrates that these were spurious
allegations.''
The jury deliberated for eight hours and three minutes. The trial had
lasted more than two months.
Shrapnel from the Semtex device Fryers was caught with could have
killed or maimed people hundreds of metres away. Anyone caught in the
fireball that would have resulted from the inclusion of petrol in the
bomb would have had no chance of escaping death or serious injury.
Having allowed Fryers to address her on condition he did not make a
political speech, the judge emphasised that everyone in court hoped
there would be a lasting peace in Ireland.
It was, she said, her duty to sentence them for activities that had
taken place in 1993, well before the IRA ceasefire.
She told Jack that he had entered the conspiracy with his eyes wide
open.
''Your final act was to hide the remaining six component parts of
bombs -- no doubt to preserve them for future use,'' she declared.
However, she did draw a distinction between the different roles of the
two conspirators.
Before being led down, Fryers smiled towards his counsel from Northern
Ireland, who had not said one word in open court throughout the trial
save to say that she would not address the jury. He gave a thumbs-up
sign which seemed to indicate the 25-year sentence was one they had both
anticipated.
Jack, who did not go into the witness box, looked towards his junior
counsel and held a hand towards his ear and mouth, indicating he would
appreciate a telephone call. Counsel nodded back.
In his address to the judge, Fryers declared that he had pled not
guilty to the charge of conspiracy ''because I am not guilty of a
criminal offence''.
He said that, when he came to the United Kingdom, he believed what he
was doing was right and he still held that belief.
Reading from a paper -- his hand shaking slightly -- Fryers declared
that he supported the peace process.
''I hope that the peace process does work,'' he said in a soft
Northern Ireland accent, ''and that all the people of Ireland will be
able to live together in a country that has a just and lasting peace

Who speaks for children when no-one thinks they should be heard?
MANY children's writers find their stories mainly in their
imagination, like sickly Stevenson with his pirates and exotic islands,
but Theresa Breslin found her first story in the reality of industrial
life in Scotland as she handed out books from the mobile library in
Strathkelvin district.
''You have a special bonding with people when you're on the mobile
library, because sometimes you're the only person they see from week to
week. One of the places I went to was Gartcosh. The children had done a
local history project on the steel mill which was kept going during the
war by the women.
''I went on to a branch library and about nine months later they
closed down Gartcosh steel mill. The people walked from Gartcosh to
London to hand in a petition. I had a friend living in London, and asked
her how the marchers had got on, but she hadn't seen anything in the
papers or on TV, so I thought I would write a story about it.''
Breslin's book, Simon's Challenge, was about the closure of a steel
works from a child's point of view, a voice that was not heard in all
the protests over Gartcosh. ''I can't honestly say I had a crusading
mission at the time,'' she recalls, ''but since then it seems to me that
a lot of things happen to children in the modern world, and they're
disempowered. They see things on television that they would never have
seen before, like Rwanda. They feel it very strongly, but they can't do
anything about it. The adults could walk from Gartcosh to London, but
what could the children do? I decided to tell the story from the child's
point of view; how it affects them if everybody's out of work, with no
money coming in.''
She had another purpose in writing Simon's Challenge. ''There's very
little written from a Scottish school child's point of view. There's
Grange Hill and American stuff, but very little validating the
experience of kids in Scotland just now. There's a terrific upsurge in
adult writing, bearing witness to what's going on just now, but I don't
see much for kids.''
Simon's Challenge (Canongate Kelpie), which won the Kathleen Fidler
Award, is about a boy who dreams of having his own computer in a house
with a baby, and a father away looking for work. However, his life
changes when he is the sole witness of a major burglary.
''As a librarian -- and from my own children as well -- I know that
when kids read about someone who's had a similar experience as
themselves it helps them; it can uplift them, make them feel better.''
She knows this because she has had many letters about Simon's Challenge,
which became a BBC TV drama and has been shown on the Continent.
Her next book was Different Directions (due in paperback from
Canongate in the autumn). ''This actually happened to a friend of mine.
She went back to the same school that her daughter was in as a teenager,
and of course her daughter was humiliated and embarrassed. My friend was
really upset that her daughter wouldn't speak to her.'' Breslin looked
at the problem from the daughter's perspective.
Kezzie (Methuen) deals with the theme of emigration. Set in a mining
community in the 1930s and based on the Twechar area, it is the story of
two girls and their grandfather. Their father has been killed in a
mining accident and the two girls are split up. The quest for reunion
takes the story to Canada.
New School Blues (Canongate Kelpie) asks the burning question about
first term at the Big School. ''Why is it you have to put up with spots,
metal contraptions for teeth, and thick-framed glasses just at that most
sensitive time of your life?'' Bullies at School (due next month from
Canongate Kelpie) also has a topical title and a story with which many
children will identify.
''It came about because I'm sometimes asked to go out to schools to
talk to children about my writing. Generally I ask them: what would you
like me to write about? Talking to kids about school bullying was like
lifting a stone.''
Her latest book, Whispers in the Graveyard (Methuen), is about a small
boy who is dyslexic and who goes to the graveyard to get comfort and
knowledge from the symbols on the stones.
Theresa Breslin has one boy and three girls, all in their teens now.
Were they inspirations and models for her writing? ''I don't think they
were models,'' she says with a laugh. ''They're good at reading my
writing and saying: 'that's garbage, mother; change it'.''
Would the prize-winning author (nominated for the Carnegie Medal and
short listed for the Children's Book Award) give up librarianship to
become a full-time children's writer? ''No, I like my job.'' In a way,
it is paid research for her own writing, watching the latest books to
see what children are reading. She hands out excellent advice for
aspirant writers for the young generation.
''The problem of writing for children is that you could lose touch
with what children actually read. There is a temptation to write what
you think they ought to be reading. If you or I had been given a book by
our mothers or grannies we would have finished it out of a sense of
duty. Kids won't do that now. They'll choose what they want. They're
buying books now so they'll buy what they want. You're really walking a
tightrope; there's no point in addressing a serious issue if they're not
going to read it.
''You've got to put in humour and to get the story right. The story's
the most important thing.''

Ronald Searle. MARQUIS DE SADE MEETS GOODY TWO-SHOES (Pavilion,
#12.99).
* BLACKNESS and grotesquerie are rare and exotic flowers in the garden
of English humour; so rare that, when they do raise their pretty little
heads, they're often mis-identified as members of some more robust and
hearty native species altogether. Cartoonist Ronald Searle's fleurs du
mal have never been properly appreciated here: his hellcat schoolgirls
of St Trinian's, for example, are usually thought of as Miss Jean
Brodie's girls on a spree rather than the sadistic little bitches that
Searle actually voiced and drew. His latest rich and strange collection
finds him better and bleaker than ever as he imagines a series of
surreal, anachronistic encounters between various historical and
fictional figures. Edvard Munch screams at the deaf Beethoven; Freud
jams his door against an invasion of demons out of Hieronymus Bosch; the
Bronte sisters pelt a distressed Paris with their books as he tries to
pick the winner. Funny ha-ha, and funny very peculiar too.
Peter Whitfield. GRASSIC GIBBON AND HIS WORLD (Press and Journal,
#9.95).
* THIS is the first biography of Lewis Grassic Gibbon since Ian
Munro's in 1966, but it doesn't cover much of his short and troubled
life that hadn't already been detailed in that excellent volume, which
was written with the co-operation of Gibbon's wife. It does have a great
many pictures of the Mearns and of Buchan, all blue skies, bright birds,
and brilliant sunsets, but little of the unrelenting wind, rain, and
grinding toil which Gibbon wrote of so expressively in A Scots Quair. At
95 pages, it could be more properly titled A Quick Look at a Man Who
Wrote a Great Book and Some Nice Pictures of the Place he Wrote it
About. It is not a bargain.
Stephen Blanchard. GAGARIN AND I (Chatto &amp; Windus, #9.99).
* DESPITE the title, this is not so much the story of an adolescent
boy's devotion to Yuri Gagarin and Russian space exploits as a deadpan
farce, set in a mid-sixties English boarding-house filled to the rafters
with eccentric lodgers and presided over by two landladies whose
exchanges bear more than a passing resemblance to those of Vladimir and
Estragon. While lovers quarrel, motorbikes go up in flames, and
14-year-old Leonard's aunt and mother fall out over a man, our hero
takes time out from monitoring the space race to discover the pleasures
of the flesh and go into the drugs business with a stock-in-trade of
worming tablets. Blanchard's tale never quite scales the dizzy heights
of the cosmonauts who haunt the fevered imagination of its hero, but
it's a fey and funny comedy of adolescence.
Chris Heath. PET SHOP BOYS VERSUS AMERICA (Penguin, #10).
* IN 1991, the Pet Shop Boys toured the US and Canada. Chris Heath and
photographer Pennie Smith went along for the ride, and their
rockumentary reportage of what happened when pop's most perfect
post-modern ironists met the land of excess head-on is a treat from
start to finish. From laborious meet'n'greets to a disastrous spot on
the Tonight show, these snapshots of life on the road with PSB reveal
Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe to be national treasures -- mischievous,
sardonic, pantomime dames, the Morecambe and Wise (and Alan Bennett) of
pop. Full of camparaderie and hilarious strops, their wit flows as
readily as the dressing-room champagne; Lowe and Tennant make you feel
that they're the only sane people left in a music industry gone mad.
Andre Dubus. BROKEN VESSELS (Picador, #5.99).
* THE responsibility of the writer to what he observes and how he
renders it is the principal concern of Andre Dubus in this collection of
autobiographical essays. A prolific short-story writer (''I love short
stories because I believe they are the way we live'', he says), his
belief in the sacredness of literature and his protectiveness towards
his own work is tense enough to make Hemingway look like a copywriter.
His attempts to avoid writing a novel become a narrative of struggle;
tormented by the idea that he is wasting his talent on snapshots and
provoked by editors claiming that there is no money in short stories,
Dubus retreats into recalcitrance. Stern and, to the naked eye, rather
humourless, Broken Vessels develops into a moving declaration of faith
that has resonances not just in the literary but in the real world too.

THE hero of the North Sea helicopter ditching yesterday described how
he had to turn off the aircraft's engines at 1000ft and said: ''I could
so easily have been a villain.''
Senior First Officer Lionel Sole, 39, a bachelor, described how he was
flying the Bristow Tiger helicopter from Aberdeen to the Brae Field on
Thursday, with 16 passengers and a fellow crewman, when it was struck by
lightning.
''We were flying in cloud when there was a bang and a flash which we
believed to be lightning,'' he said. ''There was a vibration and a
change in the note of the rotors. I thought part of the rotor system had
been damaged and started to initiate emergency action.''
A Mayday was immediately transmitted to give the helicopter's position
as 22 miles from the Marathon Brae ''A'' platform and 140 miles
north-east of Aberdeen.
With Mr Sole at the controls and Captain Cedric ''Ced'' Roberts in
command, they started to descend but, at the same time, tried to
continue towards the Brae platform.
After about three-and-a-half minutes, and having dropped 2000ft, the
situation worsened and the helicopter lost the use of its tail rotor. It
was starting to spin when they decided to shut down the two engines to
prevent it entering an uncontrollable spin.
They allowed it to ''autorotate'' -- the helicopter equivalent of
gliding -- on to the sea in just 30 seconds. This was a manoeuvre they
had practised in a simulator but had hoped never to have to repeat in a
real emergency.
Mr Sole said: ''I feel very relieved it all turned out fine. The skill
of the men in the fast rescue boats was fantastic getting alongside our
dinghy and then the stand-by boat. They are as much heroes of the whole
day as we supposedly are.''
He added: ''I think it is a fairly natural press reaction that you
either have to have a villain or a hero. If the helicopter had gone into
the water upside down we would have been villains. It went in the right
way up and we are heroes.''
Captain Roberts, 44, who is married with two children, said: ''In
these kind of situations you almost automatically deal with it using
your training and your experience. It was a surprisingly gentle landing.
The helicopter remained upright and stable and we were able to carry out
full shut-down drills and evacuate it in accordance with best procedures
in probably no more than a minute.''
He added: ''I was just doing my job. One of the strange things about
this job is you are trained to do something you hope you will never have
to do. When it happens, touch wood, it will all come together like it
did yesterday.''
Captain Roberts said he had been flying in the North Sea for 20 years
and he would not be doing it if he thought there was a problem.
Today, work will start to recover the helicopter which sank in around
350ft of water around five miles from the Brae platform. Investigators
want to discover how, for the first time in the North Sea, a lightning
strike forced a helicopter down.
Once the helicopter had been located, and assuming it had not been
broken up on its journey to the seabed, divers would be lowered to
attach wires to special lifting points on the helicopter and it would be
lifted by crane.
An AAIB spokesman said that as the aircraft was built in France,
French government investigators would be joining the team. He said that
when the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were
recovered, they would be flown to Aberdeen and then on to Farnborough
for analysis.

Bill Spalding. OLD GOVAN (Stenlake, #5.85).
THIS is a collection of 52 wonderfully evocative photographs, with
informative captions, of Govan as it used to be, and the geography is
still in most cases instantly recognisable. All of Govan life is here,
from the boats, the boys in their bunnets, and the big-booted polis
bashing their beats. There's the Govan Ferry, Water Row, the Elder, the
Lyceum, the Plaza, the Vogue; and a great picture of Mrs Green outside
her swop-and-pop shop in Plantation Street in 1925 with the
window-scribed legend ''Instalments taken. Goods carefully kept.'' Each
image would take a lot more than a thousand words to describe it. This
is a glimpse of real history.
Peter Hoeg. BORDERLINERS (Harvill, #9.99).
* AUTHOR of Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow -- an original and
atmospheric Danish whodunit that shot to the top of the best-seller
lists -- Peter Hoeg returns with a no-less-atmospheric and sinister new
novel, this time turning his talents on the shortcomings of the Danish
education system. As in Miss Smilla, philosophical meditations on time
combine with suspense and detection as three emotionally damaged young
pupils at Biehl's Academy discover themselves to be guinea pigs in an
experimental attempt to churn out model citizens who will help create a
model world. A bitter semi-autobiographical j'accuse that condemns the
labels attached to children; hypnotic and compelling.
Noam Chomsky. KEEPING THE RABBLE IN LINE: Interviews With David
Barsamian (A K Press, #9.95).
* A GREAT political weatherman, radical academic Chomsky has conducted
a one-man crusade against oppression from the early days of the Vietnam
War to the current Age of Apathy. In these interviews he waxes polemical
about the machinery of capital, human rights, the environment, gun
control, fundamentalism, and the deterioration of intellectual culture,
but while he is rightly suspicious of authority and its bread and
circuses, he is not entirely consistent in his condemnation. There is a
wearying sense that Barsamian, sitting at the feet of the Master, holds
his views infallible.
John Williams. BLOODY VALENTINE (Harper Collins, #5.99).
* ON St Valentine's Day 1988, the body of Cardiff prostitute Lynette
White was discovered in a flat above a bookie's in the notorious Tiger
Bay area of Cardiff. Three black men -- Tony Paris, Yusef Abdullahi, and
Stephen Miller were eventually tried and convicted, serving four years
in jail before the case was thrown out in the Court of Appeal. As a boy,
John Williams grew up only a stone's throw away from the city's
melting-pot, and Bloody Valentine -- part social documentary, part
true-crime investigation -- is his compelling account of the events and
their underclass milieu. Pimps, drug-addled lowlifes, and natural-born
losers are brought vividly to life, and the pulp-fiction reality of
inner-city life laid bare to its cancerous bones. Disturbing and
depressing, but enthralling none the less.

THE chief of the Clan MacDonald, Lord Godfrey MacDonald of MacDonald,
is offering North Americans a chance to ''honor'' their ancestors who
fell at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 by buying into a Culloden
Memorial Garden at his Skye hotel -- 100 miles from the battlefield.
An advert in the December issue of the Highlander magazine which
circulates in the US and Canada advises of an ''opportunity so special
it comes only once every 250 years''.
It explains: ''The centrepiece of the Garden is a Memorial Stone for
all those who fell at Culloden. Placed around this stone will be
individual memorials dedicated to those families whose forebears are
forever linked to the tragic circumstances of that battle. For
generations to come, your personal plaque or stone will honor (sic) your
ancestors or your present family members.''
Honouring forebears at Kinloch Lodge on Skye's Sleat Peninsula won't
come cheap, however: ''Memorial Stones and Plaques are available to
individuals, families or corporations in three options of style and size
starting at $250.'' Readers are advised to act quickly. For those who
take pride in their Highland heritage, ''nothing you do today could be
more important''.
Lord Godfrey also explains the site is ''as dramatic as the battle
itself'' and ''particularly appropriate for those whose forebears are of
Clan Donald descent''.
What the advert doesn't explain is that Lord Godfrey's own forebear,
Sir Alexander MacDonald of Sleat, was not actually at Culloden and,
despite having Jacobite sympathies, was officially on the Hanoverian
side.
According to clan historian Norman H MacDonald, the decision not to
take the Sleat MacDonalds out for the Jacobites may even have been taken
by Sir Alexander at a house on the site of the present hotel.
Lord Godfrey was not at Kinloch yesterday. Astaff member told The
Herald he was away on ''a few weeks' holiday'' and could not be
contacted.
He did, however, talk to the local West Highland Free Press earlier
this week, when he said the garden would mark his 25 years ''as high
chief'' as well as the 250th anniversary of Culloden.
He said some people might think he was just cashing in on the events
in 1746 but added: ''I would think that, by the time we have created the
garden, I will make very little indeed out of it. That is not the
idea.''

Giles Havergal is nearing his silver jubilee as artistic director of
the Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow -- but it is a reign which was nearly
ended at birth.
John Linklater meets the man who revolutionised British theatre.
GILES Havergal arrived as artistic director of the Citizens' Theatre
in July 1969. Within the month he was being interviewed for another
theatre job at the opposite end of the country. He travelled to the
newly-founded Northcott Theatre in Exeter, where they were interested in
him as director. His application had been in before the Citizens'
appointment was completed, and even if it eventually led to nothing, the
decision to pursue his options reveals Havergal's perception of the
precariousness of the position he discovered in Glasgow.
''There was a real feeling that I would not need to take my coat
off,'' he recalls. ''Throughout those early months it was always touch
and go. I didn't know if it would be worth staying, or if I would be
wanted.''
This was no mere paranoia. The Citz was in a complete mess. Audiences
had dropped to 25%. The company was due to be kicked out of its building
to make way for a proposed ring road, and no new home had been decided.
''There is hanging over the Citizens' a real threat to its continued
existence,'' Tory MP Esmond Wright told the Scottish Grand Committee
that month.
Worse, the Citz was infested with internal politics. Still raging was
a row over the acrimonious dismissal of Bob Cartland, the artistic
director whom Havergal replaced. He suffered some of the backlash.
Cartland had lasted only a year, the fourth director to leave in as many
years.
Havergal had been first interviewed in 1968 and lost out to Cartland.
In retrospect, this was lucky. The Cartland affair would prove a
necessary preliminary to sorting out the constitutional position of an
ageing and unrepresentative board, the rump of James Bridie's original
friends and supporters when he founded the Citizens' 26 years before, a
board increasingly resembling a reactionary quango. But that was a
battle that lay ahead.
Cartland's departing statement must have registered alarm with
Havergal and his associate, Philip Prowse, as they made their way from
Watford. ''I can no longer suffer the stultification of theatrical form
by the deadening hand of prudery,'' he said.
This did not sound too promising for a new directorate which would
soon establish a style of provocative homoeroticism, half-naked male
actors in women's parts, pink jockstraps, exotic designs, and
programming policies that the Scotsman's arts editor, Allen Wright,
would describe as ''all steeped in decadence and corruption''.
The famous Hamlet production of September 1970, when Havergal and
Prowse first let rip, would focus a confrontation that must have been
inevitable from the moment they set foot inside the door of the
Citizens'. The production prompted resignations and it brought Havergal
to within an ace of being sacked. It is not too surprising that he
entertained second thoughts in these early days, sufficient to at least
check out Exeter.
That he decided to stand his ground in Glasgow made possible one of
the unlikeliest successes in world theatre. Later approaches would come
in to take over the Nottingham Playhouse and the Lyric, Hammersmith, in
the late 1970s.
Not a single person would have predicted that Havergal would still be
around 25 years later to receive the city of Glasgow's St Mungo Prize
for outstanding citizenship. In the citations this month, a grateful
community recognised his boosting Glasgow's ''reputation internationally
as a centre of artistic excellence'' and establishing the Citizens'
Theatre ''as one of Britain's provocative and innovative repertory
theatres''. In fact, it has been an achievement in pushing the Citizens'
to the front line of European theatre over several decades, and
preserving it from the progressive stagnation of subsidised theatre in
Britain during the last quarter of a century.
Few people claim to know Giles Havergal. He is described as charming,
patrician, remote. Yet he speaks to everyone who enters his theatre, and
asks after those who are no longer around. He exhibits tremendous
loyalty, to things as much as friends. It is a curiosity, but a glance
at his photograph file confirms that he has been wearing the same kind
of knitted ties for 30 years.
He has a reputation for reticence, but his reticence applies only to
talking about himself, otherwise he leaps forward with boundless
enthusiasms. He gets his way gently, guiding like an avuncular dictator.
In rehearsals he is described as knowing what he wants, but never
resorting to bullying. He is a master of the double-edged apology, which
is the nearest he gets to issuing a rebuke. His diplomatic skills are
dazzling, and Philip Prowse, in one of his ambiguous statements of
caustic affection, has agreed, adding that ''Giles is a great loss to
the service''.
His entry is the most austere in the Scots Who's Who: ''Havergal,
Giles. Director, Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow, since 1969. Born 9.6.38.''
That birth was in Edinburgh. He is exactly half Scots, half English, a
division which leaves him without any sense of national identity. The
Scots side comes through his grandmothers, a MacLeod on his father's
side, a Graham on his mother's.
His mother, Hyacinth Chitty, had come to Glasgow in 1913. She met his
father, Dr Henry Havergal, in the city and they were married in 1928,
living in Edinburgh where Henry was director of music at Fettes College
until 1933, when they moved away. The choice of Edinburgh as birthplace
of Giles, and his brother Malcolm, was not based on national sentiment,
but on their mother's trust in a doctor she had previously consulted.
The family moved to Glasgow in 1953 when Dr Henry Havergal became
first principal of the united Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.
Giles was at boarding school at Harrow, but from the age of 15 until he
went to university at Christ Church, Oxford, to read history, the family
home was in Glasgow. he has vivid memories of his first visits to the
Citz, to see Molly Urquhart and John Fraser in Tapselteerio, Callum
Mill's performance as Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman, and the
Mathews' production of T S Eliot's The Cocktail Party.
These formative experiences must have shaped an ambition to direct
theatre that had already formed by the time he reached Oxford. He was
anxious to break in, as former Scottish Arts Council drama director,
John Faulkner, once told Cordelia Oliver, whose book on the Citizens'
Theatre is due later this year. Faulkner remembers a hot, overcrowded
meeting of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. The doorway was
blocked with aspiring thespians. Through the window came a long thin
leg, announcing the entrance of a very young Havergal, dressed in a
white suit, like a character from one of his later adaptations from P G
Wodehouse.
He was on his way, and he was in good company. With the Oxford Theatre
Group he was acting alongside Alan Bennett, John Wells, and Esther
Rantzen. He was also directing. They took three revues to consecutive
Edinburgh Festival Fringes.
In his final year he was writing to repertory theatres throughout
Britain. On graduating he was offered his first job. It was as an
assistant stage manager, at #7 15 shillings a week. The director pointed
out this was five shillings above Equity rates. This was Robert David
MacDonald.
''He has filled out a lot since then,'' observes MacDonald, Havergal's
co-director at the Citz since the early 1970s. This is a startling
concept, since Havergal's skeletal frame marks him as something of a
cross between a transluscent figure out of an El Greco portrait and an
ascetic missionary. ''He was entirely enthusiastic about everything he
did,'' continues MacDonald. ''There was no great sign of the
eccentricity that has engulfed him since.''
These must have been heady days, for they marked his professional
stage debut as an actor. In Dandy Dick he played the military suitor to
the hand of the daughter of a rural dean who has only half a liver, and
acquitted himself rather well, by all accounts. This from one of the
sternest latter-day critics of Havergal's acting ability.
Of late MacDonald has preferred to direct Havergal by inviting him to
sit down. ''When you have a not particularly well co-ordinated actor of
six feet four inches waving his arms about it rather puts everyone else
in the shade,'' reasons MacDonald. ''I usually prefer to find Giles a
chair.'' In the Citizens' production of Last Days of Mankind MacDonald
took this to an extreme, rendering Havergal sedentary for an entire four
hours at a cafe table as Kraus the Grouse. For a while Havergal was
known as Giles the Piles.
His early career was proving more mobile. The newly-introduced ABC
Television trainee scheme for directors found Havergal a placement at
the Oldham Coliseum, where he spent the first five months working under
Carl Paulsen before he earned his first night off. He spent it visiting
the theatre in Manchester.
''It was a marvellous experience at Oldham,'' Havergal recalls.
''Paulsen said I had to be in 10 minutes before rehearsals, work
alongside him in the office, and in the evenings stand with him in the
foyer to welcome the people in and see them out. That's where that whole
strand of my existence started. I learned that even with limited
resources and very limited rehearsal time, you could do good work or bad
work. It's a different world now and it's ridiculous to harp on about
it. Like talking about making corsets last century.''
His first director's job was at Her Majesty's, Barrow, a baptism of
fire, memorable principally for the experience of haggling on behalf of
a debt-ridden theatre with creditors who had not been paid for months.
Then came The Palace, Watford, and the first attraction of attention
from London critics who were impressed with Havergal's British premiere
of Tennessee Williams's Sweet Bird Of Youth, and with an
audience-building policy that had 40% under the age of 25. That was a
trend that Havergal would continue when he moved on to the Citizens'
after completing a successful five years of establishing the civic
theatre.
He was 31 when he reached Glasgow in 1969. It was the same year as his
father, now universally known as H H, retired at the RSAMD. It has been
noted as a curiosity that father and son would come to be seen as the
most successful directors in the history of Bridie's two great legacies
in the city of Glasgow. Both men were honoured with the OBE, and H H was
present at the ceremony in 1988 which completed this double.
Everyone discusses the Hamlet production of September 1970 as the
controversial breakthrough for Havergal. It had a dramatic impact in
attracting a new audience and it silenced hostile elements on the board
once box-office returns started soaring. On the final Saturday of the
run the Scotsman carried a piece which conceded: ''The Citizens' may be
going to hell on a haycart, but a hell of a lot of the Glasgow kids are
going with it.''
This was in marked contrast to the reviews, which had been almost
universally condemnatory, and the Glasgow Herald's letters page carried
on a debate for almost a full month. Archie Hind, in The Glasgow Herald,
touched on an interesting nerve when he remarked of the play's
reception: ''An occulted guilt has unkennelled itself.''
The truth is that the real revolution had been fought backstage. While
Havergal and Prowse demonstrated the right of their theatre to express
itself, their new board chairman, Bill Taylor, secured its right to
govern itself on a new constitutional basis that would become a model
for repertory theatres throughout the country.
This first battle was crucial, and in Taylor the Citz directorate
found a great ally who supported every subsequent initiative to secure
the ethos of the company: an equal pay structure for actors, free
previews, free programmes, and freedom to explore and develop the Citz's
own repertoire. These would prove the cornerstones of Havergal's
achievement.
The ideas and the artistic aesthetic might have sprung mainly from
Prowse. The literary drive came mainly from MacDonald. But Havergal was
the man who brought all these elements together and made them work,
never allowing his theatre to endanger itself by straying into the red.
Yet he remains a mystery. MacDonald insists that this is, indeed,
because Giles Havergal is an eccentric. ''I remember standing back and
looking at him once in the foyer,'' he says. ''There he was in his dark
suit and Brigade of Guards tie, welcoming unsuspecting people into the
theatre. I just thought he looked so utterly unlike the person he really
is.''
