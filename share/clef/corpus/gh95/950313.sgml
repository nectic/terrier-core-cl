NORTHERN Ireland's Darren Clarke had to settle for a share of second
place when he fired a final round 70 in the Malaysian Open in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday. ''I missed a lot of big putts,'' said Clarke. ''I was
trying to catch up after the twelfth hole but couldn't.''
Clarke, the overnight leader with eventual winner Clay Devers, posted
a four-round, 11-under-par total of 277 to finish one adrift of the
American at Templer Park Country Club.
Leading scores:
276 -- C Devers (USA) 71, 69, 67, 69.
277 -- D Chopra (Sweden) 70, 71, 69, 67; K Wentworth (USA) 71, 70, 69,
67; D Clarke (Britain) 67, 70, 70, 70.
279 -- F Nobilo (New Zealand) 69, 74, 69, 67; R Todd (Canada) 74, 73,
64, 68.
Other scores included: 281 -- M Campbell (New Zealand) 69, 72, 69, 71.
283 -- M Roe (Britain) 73, 70, 69, 71. 284 -- L Westwood (Britain) 72,
73, 72, 67.

Opera
THE final moments of Luc Bondy's superlative production are so
disturbing that Herod's order to ''kill that woman'' comes as a relief.
As Salome kisses the severed head of John the Baptist, her voluptuous
frenzy and the inevitability of her doom send an unmistakable chill up
the collective spine of the Royal Opera audience.
We are in Roman-occupied Palestine. Herod -- a convincingly seedy and
paranoid Kenneth Riegel -- has the prophet Jokanaan (John the Baptist)
under guard in a hole in the ground, from where the prophet curses Herod
and his degenerate family.
When Jokanaan does crawl out it is to be examined and lusted over by
Salome, Herod's randy step-daughter. She demands a kiss. He refuses to
look at her, and leaves her in an unsatisfied frenzy. In exchange for a
promise to give her anything she wants, Salome dances for Herod. Her
price: the head of Jokanaan on a silver platter.
Catherine Malfitano delivers a masterful performance as a debauched
Salome. Musically assured -- this exquisite voice is undaunted by the
final raging demands for Jokanaan's head -- she also manages an
erotically-charged dance of the seven veils that reduces Herod to
nail-biting lust. Bryn Terfel, an enormous voice as Jokanaan, provides
the only dignity amid the decay.
The design is suitably black, lit by the cold light of a disturbed
moon streaming through slatted windows. Christoph von Dohnanyi conducts
Strauss' huge score -- lots of swooping, angry brass -- with assurance.
But what remains in the mind's eye is the sensuality gone mad of
Malfitano's unsurpassable Salome.

FOUR men, including a police officer, are to appear in court accused
of involvement in what is believed to be an international trade in
looted treasures from Egypt and China.
They were arrested following an operation involving police in London
and Cairo, other British police forces, and Customs and Excise.
They will appear before London's Horseferry Road magistrates court on
July 20 charged with dishonestly handling stolen goods, and conspiracy
to steal.
Scotland Yard named three of those charged as Mr Jonathan
Tokely-Parry, 43, of Iddesleigh, Devon; Mr Andrew May, 36, of Westaway,
Pilton West, Barnstaple, north Devon; and Mr Roger Box, 45, a police
officer, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
The fourth man has not yet been identified. Two other un-named men,
one from Bath and one from Hull, have been bailed pending further
inquiries.
It is believed police have recovered a large quantity of Egyptian and
Chinese antiquities.
No value for the items seized has been revealed.
The Sunday Times suggested the operation was designed primarily to
halt a multi-million pound trade in 5000-year-old artefacts from tombs
at the Egyptian city of Saqqara, a royal burial ground overlooking the
ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis.
It is thought the treasures included hieroglyphic reliefs, sculptures,
gold jewellery, amulets, and mummified remains. Arrests are also thought
to have been made in Egypt.

HERBIE Hide was an angry young man after his sixth-round WBO
heavyweight title defeat in Las Vegas on Saturday night. Angry with
Herbie Hide, that is.
But Hide was wrong to be as hard on himself as Riddick Bowe's clubbing
fists proved to be, because he painfully learned to his cost that size
and strength beat him more than any other reason.
The gallant Hide took the blame for losing his championship at the MGM
Grand Garden when he mixed it instead of moving and boxing in the way
that he knows best.
And he may now realise deep down that the physical bulk and sheer
power of the men at the deadly serious end of boxing's premier division
likewise could crush his future ambitions to win another major title.
Hide, outweighed by two stones and not one of nature's big
heavyweights, was guilty of being too anxious to please.
As a result, Hide had to display courage beyond the call of duty to
last as long as two minutes, 25 seconds of the sixth, after having
dominated a ponderous and lethargic Bowe with his sharp boxing, movement
and some stinging attacks in the opening two rounds.
But once Bowe's first, sickening jab rammed home early in the third,
the fight changed completely, and Hide was struggling.
But fight back he did, only to be sent repeatedly to the canvas. There
were seven official knockdowns tolled out by referee Richard Steele of
Las Vegas. Hide was also on the deck twice more from slips.
''I'm angry; I've never been so angry before in my life,'' said Hide.
''I'll be champion again. If Bowe is the best, then I believe I am one
of the best. I should have stuck to my game plan and boxed him.
''I didn't want to run like Larry Donald did against him December. My
trainer Freddie King told me to move and box. I'd still be champion if
I'd done that. I'll be back in the next couple of months, and champion
again in another 12.''
Hide was a genuine 15st 4lb for this first defence which carried the
mighty consolation of a security-for-life #2m-plus purse.
Manager Barry Hearn said: ''Herbie fought the wrong fight. He was so
impressed with hurting Riddick Bowe early in the contest and won the the
first two rounds clearly. As a young, 23-year-old, he let the blood
rise.
''Herbie proved he's got the heart and courage to become a great
champion. He'll be back in a year's time bigger and stronger. We'll be
asking the WBO to keep Hide as the No.1. And then he'll whip Bowe.''
Hide was lucky to escape a three knockdown elimination in round three
when Steele judged that the champion's first trip to the canvas came by
way of a hefty shove.
But Hide said he had been clubbed behind the left ear, the reason for
his obvious distress, and was sent sprawling twice more, once from
Bowe's trademark ripping right uppercut.
He went down twice more in the fourth, although he had made such a
brave effort -- and not a completely unsuccessful one -- to show that he
was not about to capitulate, and stung Bowe a couple of times.
Hide was floored, as well as slipping, in the fifth and, determined to
go down with all guns blazing, was put over twice more in the sixth when
a big whack low down to the ribs followed by a right to the head finally
sucked all the resistance out of him and Steele completed his count to
10.
Bowe's first defence was immediately announced for the MGM on June 17
against the brash, unbeaten Cuban Jorge Luis Gonzalez, a two-round
winner on the same bill over Bryan Scott, of Kansas City, who had got
married on the night before the fight.
There were plenty of stage-managed, intimidating verbals at the post
fight news conference betweem Bowe and Gonzalez once Hide had taken his
leave.
''Herbie was very courageous, but I must admit this was not one of my
best performances. I got hurt and got a little over anxious,'' said
Bowe. ''He was faster than I thought, but the pressure told.''
Bowe will take off to Indiana this week to visit Mike Tyson before the
ex-champ is freed from jail on March 25.
There will be soundings of a #75m offer for Bowe and Tyson to meet in
a mega-New York fight at Madison Square Garden on the second weekend in
November.
Bowe could well be at the head of queue to meet Tyson, but there were
enough unimpressive periods against Hide which could point to Iron Mike
toppling him if they get to trade leather next winter.

LIZ McColgan had mixed emotions after her third-place finish yesterday
in the Lisbon half marathon. Just three weeks before she is due to make
her marathon comeback in London, she clocked 69min 49sec, 88 seconds
behind the winner, Tecla Loroupe.
The Kenyan's compatriot, Simon Lopuyet, won the men's event in
1-00-26. Loroupe, first in last year's New York marathon, clocked 68-21,
with Anuta Catuna (Portugal) second in 69-16.
McColgan had no problems injury-wise, but hoped to run faster. She has
only recently cut back on very high mileage in preparation for London.
''Liz is a perfectionist,'' said her father, Martin, whom she
contacted after the event. ''She's not delighted by the time, but is
confident she will run a lot better in London.''
McColgan still plans to race the Scottish six-stage relay next weekend
as a member of Dundee Hawkhill men's team.

SOME clubs are striving to make themselves financially less dependent
on their supporters, and it is probable that one or two of the larger
outfits will become more heavily reliant on commercial income.
Rangers, for instance, are already in a position where almost 50% of
their annual income is drawn from commercial activities, and while the
thought of the fan's influence diminishing jars the senses, recent
trends suggest the masses have to be pushed back into line.
Frankly they have too much to say for themselves. They have forgotten
their true role in the sport.
Of course, they will always have a part to play, in that without a
crowd there would be no atmosphere, and without noise and fervour the
game would suffer, with players struggling to motivate themselves in
front of empty stands. There would be no spectacle, no sense of
occasion, so, first of all, let's hear it for the fans.
However, let us also hear a little less from the supporters, whose
function is a supporting one and not the lead part. The players are the
real stars, although in recent times the customers have appeared more
anxious to command centre stage.
Now, fans like those who followed Stenhousemuir's progress in the
Tennents Scottish Cup I can take, but it is this other breed who make me
cringe. Having witnessed people-power helping bring down the Berlin Wall
and, even more momentously, the family dynasties at Celtic Park, some
supporters believe they should have a say on every issue.
They point and shout as though they know better than anyone else, when
in fact all they are doing is making a noise and clouding matters. Do
they actually believe the game's powerbrokers give a damn?
They are the type who clamoured a few years ago for the dismissal of
Alex Smith as manager of Aberdeen, and insisted Willie Miller be
installed only to grow disillusioned with him. Roy Aitken can expect the
same level of support as he attempts to pull together what remains of a
once promising Aberdeen side in the hope of avoiding relegation. With
supporters like them, no Pittodrie manager needs any enemies.
There is no shortage of people bloated with their own self-importance
in the south either, and we have had to listen to voices defending Eric
Cantona and George Graham, while others have spoken about the game's
ills as though they have the panacea. People power? I'm sick of it.
Television and radio should stop pushing microphones in front of
supporters -- there are enough paid megalomaniacs spouting their views
(steady boy, a little self-analysis creeping in here) -- who ought to
shuffle back into line at the turnstiles where they belong, because the
truth is most of the customers don't know what they want and neither are
they rich in alternatives.
Why anyone should be expected to listen to people who normally spend a
couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon denegrating, insulting, and
abusing opposing supporters and clubs is beyond me.
They are hardly the type you would want to be with in any kind of
football think-tank, and the media ought to stop encouraging them to
give us their pearls of group wisdom. Most of their arguments would keep
an asylum full of psychiatrists busy for a decade trying to unravel
their logic.
What we have here is democracy gone wild and much as we enjoy taking
potshots at the adminstration, the establishment, the tenants of Bleak
House -- oh, if you insist I'll give them their proper name, the SFA --
it is impossible to imagine the state the game would be in if supporters
were in a position to make changes.
However, this is not to say all fans should be told to be quiet,
because there are some worth listening to. Fans like Martin Rose,
secretary of the Scottish Football Supporters' Association, who has
taken time to analyse the game's trends and ways.
Rose is a Motherwell fan -- but wait, don't let that put you off.
After all, he didn't ask to be born into that particular burden -- who
tends to speak with reason. Sound judgment is usually the basis of his
arguments, which is much more than can be said for many of those he
represents.
He rarely feels the need to raise his voice, realising a different
view can be expressed without contorting his face into a snarl. Now,
this kind of supporter can be accommodated, but the masses should be
grateful they are still allowed to be heard shouting insults and
obscenities during what are essentially public gatherings.
Of course, they pay their money, but don't trot out that old chestnut
that because they dig deep they are entitled to behave like congenital
idiots. People pay to go to the cinema, theatre, and concert halls, and
at none of these venues would customers be allowed to deal in the same
verbal misbehaviour.
The fact is, a large number, perhaps even the majority of people who
watch football, are incapable of reasoned debate. Aggressive, growling
and menacing confrontation is their way and I would like these people to
do us all a favour.
Just shut up. Please.

Fort Lauderdale
MARK O'Meara, harried to the last hole by Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam,
managed to keep his cool and break a three-year winless streak, taking
the Honda Classic by a stroke over Faldo and by two from Woosnam.
O'Meara shot a level-par round of 71, while watching his lead shrink
during the round from a high of six strokes on the front nine to a very
brief tie with Woosnam, who sank a 30-foot eagle putt on the twelfth
just minutes before O'Meara's birdie on the hole would snatch it back.
Both Faldo and Woosnam missed short birdie putts over the closing
holes that could have altered matters. The four closing holes at Weston
Hills Country Club comprise, by far, the toughest finish on the US Tour,
but Woosnam and Faldo played them well, Faldo better than anyone did all
week.
Walking off the fifth hole yesterday, Faldo had just made his second
bogey in a row, and was six shots behind O'Meara; 12 holes later he was
standing over a five-foot birdie putt that would have been his third
birdie in a row and would have given him a share of the lead for the
first time all week. He missed the putt, then failed to make a birdie on
the eighteenth.
Faldo said: ''I'm pleased with the way I played. I really found the
greens difficult. I was grinding over a lot of those putts today. So at
the end of the day, I can say it was a good week for me. I was behind,
but at the end I still had half a chance. After having been two over
par, to shoot two under was great. In these tough conditions I probably
would have thought 69 would have been enough, but all credit to Mark. He
did what he had to do.''
O'Meara played steadily over the front nine, which was all he needed
to do, adding birdies on the third and ninth holes to get to 11 under
for the tournament. Faldo, who began the day at six under, was still at
that figure after nine holes, but it took quite an effort to stay within
five strokes of O'Meara.
O'Meara stumbled on the next two holes, missing short putts for par,
and allowing Woosnam to close. Woosnam, who had also been six shots
behind at one point, made three birdies in a row from the sixth before
his eagle. The Welshman, making his first start of 1995, had two bogeys
coming in to drop back into third place.
After the fourteenth, O'Meara played steadily again, deftly saving par
when he needed to, but otherwise just tapping in to maintain his
nine-under-par total. Final scores (Americans unless stated):
275 -- M O'Meara 68, 65, 71, 71.
276 -- N Faldo (England) 67, 71, 69, 69.
277 -- I Woosnam (Wales) 68, 72, 69, 68.

Other scores included: 290 -- C Montgomerie (Scotland) 69, 75, 71, 75.
293 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 71, 73, 76, 73.
* BRITAIN'S Caroline Pierce shot a two-under-par 70 for a three-round
total of 212 to be two shots off the lead held by American Dottie
Mochrie in the LPGA Tour's #300,000 Ping-Welch's championship in Tucson,
Arizona. Laura Davies shot a 74 for 219.
Mochrie led Amy Alcott by a stroke starting out, and picked up a new
pursuer when Pierce carded a 70 -- the only sub-par score by a late
finisher -- and finished at 212. Alcott, who struggled early, birdied
the last four holes to salvage a 73 and pull even with Pierce. Cindy
Rarick and Swede Annika Sorenstam were three shots behind Mochrie.
Pierce birdied the third, fourth, and seventh holes, but three-putted
the ninth and two-putted No.12 after hitting her approach shot over the
green. She came back with a tap-in for birdie on the fifteenth hole.
Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
210 -- D Mochrie 70, 68, 72.
212 -- C Pierce 75, 67, 70 (Britain); A Alcott 70, 69, 73.

Atlanta
THE groundwork has been laid. The stadium has been booked. The players
are now assembled.
Atlanta, Georgia, host city to next year's Olympic Games, is this week
the appropriate setting for the countdown to the kick-off for Scotland's
first professional American Football team, the Scottish Claymores, with
the start of a month-long pre-season training camp.
And if early indications and the opinion of a Super Bowl legend are
anything to go by, then Scotland can expect to see a tough, successful
team lining up at Murrayfield next month.
Doug Williams is that legend. He became the first black quarterback to
play in a Super Bowl, with the Washington Redskins in 1988. Williams put
in a record-breaking performance on the big day, passing for 340 yards
and winning the Most Valuable Player award en route to victory over the
Denver Broncos.
Remarkably, he quickly dropped from the limelight but then made a
career for himself as a coach. After stints at high schools in Louisiana
and a year at the Navy Academy as a quarterbacks' coach, Williams now
finds himself in the role of receivers' coach with the Claymores,
preparing for a trip to Scotland next month for the start of the World
League season.
The Claymores began sharpening up last week when the 53 Americans,
seven Scots, and a coaching staff of eight -- including Fifer Michael
Kenny, the team's home-based coach -- assembled in Atlanta.
The six-team league, developed from an earlier initiative in Europe by
the National Football League, also includes London Monarchs, Dusseldorf
Rheinfire, Amsterdam Admirals, Frankfurt Galaxy, and Barcelona Dragons.
The Scots' rivals also are in Atlanta for training camps and yesterday
the Claymores, led by head coach Larry Kuharich, won a warm-up match
against the Rheinfire, a rehearsal for the season-opener on April 9 at
Murrayfield.
The Claymores, after having looked the fitter team throughout the
three-hour controlled scrimmage, emerged victorious thanks to a single
touchdown by the team's leading running back, Siran Stacy.
Kuharich -- who carries with him a reputation for toughness and
discipline and is described by Williams as ''a blue-collar coach'' --
was not content with adhering to the half-day training sessions which
the rival coaches were putting their teams through.
He has set the Claymore squad a tough regime of two-a-day practice
sessions and meetings starting at 6am and running through to 9pm. He
vindicates his hard-line stance: ''I expect my players to try their
best, never give up and to play hard for 60 minutes. I want my players
to be fresh in the last quarter of any game we play. When you get tired,
you start to make mistakes -- my team will not be tired, and will not
make any mistakes.''
Even the seasoned American players, many of whom have played in the
top-flight NFL, have found the going stressful under the tough coach.
Certainly the seven Scots ''national'' players, who up until three
months ago had been amateurs playing on British club teams, have never
experienced anything quite like it.
Among them is wide receiver Scott Couper, who played for eight years
with the amateur Glasgow Lions and is now trying to deal with the shock
of life in the professional ranks. ''It's certainly been an
eye-opener,'' he said.
0 The heavy practices have brought side-effects, with a steep casualty
rate. Ten players were ruled out of the warm-up match yesterday due to
injuries picked up during the first week. Eight others were receiving
physiotherapy, and currently, out of the squad of 60, 22 are undergoing
some form of treatment.
But Kenny thinks the tough line can only benefit the team in the long
run. ''It's amazing the number of players who were griping, but now see
a point to it. We were much more prepared than the Germans and it
showed.''
Williams, who has struck up a friendship with Kenny, added: ''Yes, it
has been a hard training camp, but the harder you work, the luckier you
get.
''I think we are looking real good for a team that has only been
together for a week, especially from a fitness standpoint.''
And the giant American looked ahead to bringing the squad to Scotland
at the end of this month. ''What the Scottish people will see is an
aggressive, hard-hitting team. We'll have good receivers, two quality
quarterbacks, and a defense that's going to hit hard. Most of all, we'll
try to show them a good brand of football. We'll have a good, solid team
and one which ultimately will have a very good chance of winning.''

GYMNASTICS
THE Romanian women's team had a comfortable victory over Great Britain
at the Kelvin Hall in Glasgow this weekend.
More than 1000 people saw the world champions compete in the vault,
bars, beam, and floor, winning with 194.425 points on Saturday. Great
Britain, ranked twelfth in the world, scored 182.875.
Great Britain's national coach, Adrian Stan, himself a Romanian, was
encouraged by the display. ''This was a good platform to build on for
the championships in Japan in October,'' he said.
The Romanians took the top seven places in the individual event.
Claudia Presacan and Simona Amanar shared gold medal with scores of
39.175, while Camelia Andronic took silver with 38.9.
Britain had one of their top competitors missing as home champion Zita
Lusack could only compete in the bars due to a hip injury.
Reigning European champion Alexandra Marinescu had led from an early
stage but a fall on the beam cost her dearly. Results:
Romania -- Vault -- 49.15. Bars -- 48.40. Beam -- 48.95. Floor --
47.925. Total 194.425.
Great Britain -- Vault -- 46.825. Bars -- 45.175. Beam -- 44.375.
Floor -- 46.50. Total 182.875.

JANSHER Khan, who dropped a game to Scotland's Peter Nicol in the
semi-finals, defeated England's Peter Marshall 15-13, 15-8, 15-7 to
retain the Portuguese Open title in Lisbon, writes Elspeth Burnside.
Marshall, the world No.2, had beaten Jansher for the first time in a
British League match last month, but never threatened a repeat.
The final lasted 62 minutes with only the first game, in which
Marshall had led 12-11, being closely contested.
Jansher's stiffest opposition in the event came from Nicol, the world
No.5 taking the second game and extending the match to 77 minutes. The
Scottish champion was the last player to defeat Jansher in a
world-ranking event -- the Welsh Classic 13 months ago.
The next meeting between the pair could be in the British Open in
Cardiff next week.
This week, Nicol has two chances to upset Marshall, first in a
telesquash exhibition at Colinton Castle in Edinburgh tomorrow and on
Wednesday in a #2000 winner-takes-all challenge to mark the opening of
the new National Squash Centre at Heriot Watt University.

* CHRIS Robison, forced to drop out of last weekend's world
cross-country trial when in a position to qualify for the British team,
achieved a measure of consolation when he finished third in the English
national championship on Saturday at Luton.
The Scot was headed by Spencer Duval and Andrew Pearson, both of whom

WOMEN'S HOCKEY:
ALLI Grant has been sidelined since August because of a serious back
injury but her debut for Edinburgh Ladies in league games at the weekend
confirmed how important she could be for them in the run-in, writes
Joseph Dillon.
In Saturday's 4-0 win over Boroughmuir she was denied twice by
goalkeeper Sue Lawrie, who was beaten by international colleagues Louise
Burton (twice), Diane Renilson, and Rhona Simpson.
Grant scored the only goal against Bonagrass Grove yesterday. Five
minutes before half-time she managed to get on the end of a rebound from
a penalty-corner effort from Simpson.
Champions Western were in devastating form, scoring 13 goals in their
two outings, with Susan MacDonald, the Scotland and Great Britain
striker, scoring hat tricks on Saturday in their 7-0 defeat of their
second string in the league, and again in their 6-1 league cup defeat of
Hyndland yesterday. Results:

MENZIESHILL made a clean sweep of the indoor titles this season but
they proved yesterday at Maryfield, Dundee, that they are no pushovers
outdoors, either, when they knocked arch-rivals MIM out of the Scottish
Cup by 3-0.
The Taysiders made the decisive breakthrough nine minutes before
half-time and twice hit the target in the course of three minutes. Kenny
Stibbles opened their account with a penalty after Andrew Kay had been
hit on the head at a penalty corner by an effort from John Christie.
Graeme Wylie secured their second when, at another corner, he picked
up the rebound from a Ross Yule shot to score. Jimmy Cox put the game
beyond recall 15 minutes from time.
Grange beat Watsonians 6-0 and now have a five-point advantage in the
league but MIM have two games in hand. Results:

GIANTKILLER Mark Johnston-Allen slew another top player to reach the
last 16 of the Kloster Thailand Open in Bangkok yesterday.
Johnston-Allen beat world No.5 Jimmy White 5-4 to follow recent wins
over Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan.
In their three previous clashes, White had won 22 frames and lost only
three, and last month the Whirlwind thrashed the world No.44 5-0 in the
quarter-final of the International Open.
Johnston-Allen's highest break was 53 to level at 2-2, but he had to
fight back again from 4-2 down, and crucial runs of 32 and 35 in the
final frame sealed victory.
Scottish teenager John Higgins suffered only his third defeat in 23
matches this year when he was beaten 5-2 by Peter Ebdon on Saturday.
Higgins, despite breaks of 86, 76, and 45, found Ebdon on top of his
form. ''But this setback won't knock my confidence one bit,'' said the
19-year-old. World No.10 Ebdon had breaks of 94, 87, 69, and 61.
Weekend results:
K Doherty (Ire) beat J Ferguson (Eng) 5-4; G Wilkinson (Eng) beat T
Griffiths (Wal) 5-3; P Ebdon (Eng) beat J Higgins (Sco) 5-2; C Thorburn
(Can) beat J Swail (N Ire) 5-4; D Morgan (Wal) beat S Simngam (Thai)
5-4; S Davis (Eng) beat P Polboon (Thai) 5-1; M Johnston-Allen (Eng)
beat J White (Eng) 5-4; D Roe (Eng) beat T Chappel (Wal) 5-4; J Wattana
(Thai) beat W Brown (Eng) 5-1; W Thorne (Eng) beat J Wallace (Eng) 5-2.

Barcelona
BRITAIN'S most exciting moment of a nationally dismal World Indoor
Athletics Championships was when God Save The Queen was struck up. The
UK support buzzed with confusion. The media erupted up in a frisson of
consternation. Had they missed our big moment?
No, merely the triple jump victory by Bermuda's Brian Wellman -- a
rarity which, by virtue of a quirky colonial hangover, was celebrated by
the British national anthem.
Wellman came within five centimetres of the world record, but hurdles
bronze, by Tony Jarrett, was as close as Britain got to matching the 60
metres silver won by Darren Braithwaite on the opening night.
Jarrett, who has lived so long in the shadow of world record-holder
Colin Jackson, failed to flourish in the light of his unaccustomed
exposure. With the Welshman absent, Jarrett produced the fastest time of
his life, 7.42sec, yet it was insufficient.
Having been third in the medal table two years ago, in Toronto,
Britain sank to joint twentieth, headed by, among others, such improbale
athletics powers as Kazakhstan, Mozambique, Norway, and Bermuda -- and
six nations who do not even have an indoor track.
Britain's final indignity was last of four in the men's 4X400m relay,
and fourth of five in the women's. John Regis, having reached the 200m
final, flew home leaving victory to European outdoor champion Geir Moen,
of Norway, and explanation for his absence to the team management.
They will argue that on the basis of placings in finals, Britain were
sixth. But if the sport is to retain its high profile, then
second-string teams of this kind must cease. Minus Linford Christie and
co., it was like a bull fight without the bull.
Allen Johnson and Jarrett, drawn in adjacent lanes in the 60m hurdles,
brushed arms several times, with Jarrett appearing the impeded victim.
Then a second American, Courtney Hawkins, who had not previously beaten
Jarrett this winter, sneaked up on Johnson's blind side to relegate
Jarrett to third. Jackson's old nemesis, defending champion Mark McKoy,
was fourth.
Johnson won in a championship record of 7.39, with Hawkins on 7.41,
pirating the silver by one-hundredth of a second from Jarrett.
The breakthrough of 60m silver medallist Darrren Braithwaite apart,
this was a championship best forgotten by Britain.
Christie's absence, and that of so many leading performers -- only
nine Olympic champions and five reigning indoor world record holders
were here -- devalued the event.
Few people believe official IAAF denials that financial inducements
were offered to lure back the biggest names. However, among the
superstars, world high-jump record-holder Javier Sotomayor delivered
with 2.38m for victory, and failed narrowly at a world best of 2.44m
while Irina Privalova made history with victory at her third distance.
The Muscovite won an awesome 400m victory, though well short of her
target, Jarmila's Kratochvilova's world best of 49.59. Through 200m in
23.89, the Russian won in 50.23, fourth fastest person indoors, and the
world's best time since 1984.
Sandie Richards, Jamaica's defending champion, followed her across the
line in 51.38 -- the biggest winning margin ever. Jearl Miles, the world
outdoor champion at the distance, was fifth in 52.01.
Privalova is the first woman to win indoor titles at three different
distances, having won the 60m in 1991, and the 200m two years ago, in
Toronto.
Darnell Hall, who finished almost a second behind Michael Johnson's
world record (44.63) in the US championships, took the men's 400m in
46.17.
The men's 800m crown, which Tom McKean elected not to defend, went to
Clive Terrelonge (Jamaica) in 1min 47.30sec, after a suicidal opening
100m, in 12.4sec, had crippled the Kenyan challenge. McKean's winning
time two years ago was 1-47.29. Mozambique's Maria Mutola logged her
forty-first successive win to take the women's 800m title.
Gennaro di Napoli led from gun to tape for a successful defence of the
3000m title in 7-50.89. Yorkshireman John Mayock finished in 7-51.86,
but was run out of the medals, placing fifth.
Border Harrier Alex Kruger was another of the limited UK successes,
fifth in the heptathlon with a UK record of 5978, behind French winner
Christian Plaziat.

MARTIN Shields, the Paisley Pirates coach, was philosophical after his
Division 1 side were crushed 11-2 by Fife Flyers at Kirkcaldy in
yesterday's Scottish Cup final, writes Nigel Duncan.
Shields, who has guided his side to the promotion play-offs, is
convinced that the Pirates' victory over premier-division Edinburgh
Racers in Saturday's semi-final will make other sides take notice.
But the gap between the divisions was shown in yesterday's final, when
the Fife side coasted to victory.
Flyers gave themselves a timely boost by defending the cup
successfully on the eve of their British championship play-off campaign.

AN amazing fightback by Northern Ireland with 13 goals in the last
quarter of the match against Scotland's seven goals gave the visitors a
narrow 48-46 victory in the international match at Glenrothes.
Northern Ireland's furious counter attacks and ability to hold on to
the ball prevented the home side stageing a comeback. It was a
brilliantly exciting game which had the large home support on the edge
of their seats. The player of the match was Northern Ireland's wing
defence Deirdre Robsin who had a spectacular display. Other results:

PETE Sampras and Andre Agassi, the top two ranked players in the world
will meet in the final of the $1.8m Newsweek Champions Cup in Indian
Wells, California. World No.1 Sampras beat eleventh seed Stefan Edberg,
of Sweden, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, while Agassi beat German's Boris Becker 6-4,
7-6 (7-4).
TOP-seeded Steffi Graf took home her eighty-eighth career trophy after
having won the $430,000 Delray Beach Winter championships in Florida
yesterday with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over second-seeded Conchita Martinez
of Spain.
Graf's victory in a constant, swirling wind tied her with Evonne
Goolagong Cawley for third place on the WTA Tour's list of all-time
title-holders. Martina Navratilova leads with 167, followed by Chris
Evert with 157.
BRITAIN'S John Lloyd and Peter Fleming of the United States lost 7-5,
2-6, 4-6 to American duo Johan Kriek and Dick Stockton in the doubles
final of the #200,000 Champions tour event for men 35 and over in
Naples, Florida.
THE David Lloyd Club, Renfrew, failed in their bid to become the first
Scottish team to win the Vauxhall Indoor Trophy when they lost to
Essex-based Clearview in Saturday's semi-final in Nottingham. The
Renfrew side got off to a disastrous start when Martin Kilday lost 6-1,
6-2 to Gavin Bradford but captain Donald Watt looked set to level the
score when he took the first set 6-1 against Danny Ward. However, the
former Scottish No.1 failed to sustain his lead and went down 1-6, 6-1,
6-3 to give Clearview a 2-0 winning margin.

SCOT Anthony Reid got his challenge for the All Japan Touring Car
Championship off to a fine start when he drove his HKS Opel Vectra to
second and third places in the opening rounds of the series at the Fuji
International Speedway yesterday.
NEXT month's London-Mexico Rally has been banned from entering Panama
by government officials worried that the cars will carry cattle disease
into the country.
The ban means that organisers of the 30-day, 10,000-mile race will
have to find another route around the Central American country -- or
launch an appeal to the Panamanian ministry of agriculture to reconsider
their decision. ''Panama is a critical link to the rest of Central
America, there is no other road route,'' said event director Nick
Brittan. ''We are going to have to find a sea route that will take cars
and drivers from Colombia to Costa Rica.

LEN Lungo, whose three favourites were beaten at Ayr on Saturday,
apologised yesterday to any punters who lost money on his horses.
He said ''I'm sorry for any punters who put money on the favourites,
but the conditions were exceptional.''
Before the meeting speculation was all about just how many Lungo
horses would win. In the end the Carrutherstown trainer went home empty
handed.
Dorlin Castle, the 11-10 favourite in the first race, was pulled up
three out and the stewards accepted the explanation that the top weight
was unable to handle the heavy ground. Significantly, only three
finished out of 11 runners.
In the handicap chase over an extended three miles, Nawrik, 11-8
favourite, had been expected to ''go through the ground'' but the
six-year-old was unable to jump in the conditions and trailed in last of
six.
The banker bet of the day was Santa Concerto, 4-6 favourite in the
bumper, Described by Lungo as ''possibly the best horse I've had through
my hands'' he had won in testing conditions at Carlisle a month ago. It
was felt the big chestnut gelding could cope with anything.
Patiently ridden by Fraser Perratt he came to take up the running
entering the home straight, but two furlongs out he was joined by Jonjo
O'Neill's Give Best -- owned in Troon by Tony Collins, who went on to
win by nine lengths.

* FINDON trainer Josh Gifford, who has more than a dozen of his
stable's leading lights poised to run at Cheltenham, bids to start the
week on a bright note at Huntingdon today, writes White and Gold.
Gifford saddles Rainbow Castle in the March Handicap Chase and the
eight-year-old looks fairly treated for his handicap bow.
With hindsight, he needed to be a super horse to dispose of Gales
Cavalier on his chasing debut at Kempton but the fact he started as
short as 9-2 shows the regard in which he is held.
He had no chance in third spot when falling two fences from home that
day but bounced back from that mishap to beat Dear Do by nine lengths at
Fontwell in January.
The front-running son of Le Moss survived a second-last-fence blunder
then to win comfortably and the form was given a boost when Dear Do went
on to collect a handicap at Folkestone.

THE outcome of the special general meeting of clubs which has been
called for Fort William tomorrow night to decide the outcome of Skye's
claim for their tie against Oban Camanachd will depend on how clubs
react to the explanations of the circumstances leading up to the
postponement of the game.
The meeting is likely to be contentious at best, although the most
likely outcome appears to be a classic compromise, with Skye unlikely to
succeed in their claim for the tie. The island side felt the only way
they could get a hearing at which they could explain their grievances
was by lodging a formal claim for the tie.
Oban Camanachd will contest Skye's suggestions that they ''wilfully or
deliberately'' misled association president Duncan Cameron with a view
to gaining advantage from having the tie postponed.
Meanwhile, Oban Celtic's senior side went down to Glasgow Mid Argyll
at Govan in the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup and the juniors lost at Fort
William in the Sutherland Cup.
The up-shot of Saturday's matches is that Fort William and Kilmallie,
near neighbours in Lochaber, will meet for the first time ever in a
national cup final at Spean Bridge on April 8. Kilmallie beat Beauly by
the odd goal in three.
Glenorchy's premier league aspirations took a knock when Kyles
Athletic dumped them 6-2 at home.
In the north, Strathglass came out on top in the division two top of
the table clash, defeating Caberfeidh to stay a point ahead of
Inverness. Results:
Glenmorangie Camanchd Cup Fourth Round Replay -- Glasgow Mid-Argyll 2,

SCOTLAND won the Boys Quadrangular International for the first time at
La Querce, outside Rome, yesterday. A 5-4 victory over the host country
in their final match edged the tournament in their favour.
Having struggled in the afternoon singles all week, it was a rallying
performance in the individual event which secured a rare win.
That spark of late form placed the six-man team on 2[1/2] points, one
ahead of both Italy and France with Sweden, who tied wih Scotland on
Saturday, slumping to a worst ever final placing with just half a point.
Scotland's non-playing captain Scott MacDonald declared himself ''very
happy'' with his side's performance and stressed how early in the season
it was. He said: ''These boys have come to Italy having probably hit
only practice shots on a driving range back home. They have performed
very well in hot conditions on a class course with some very quick
greens. Certainly, this is not what they would have been used to.''
Details:
Italy 4, Scotland 5.
Foursomes: S Young (Inverallochy) and O Lindsay (Murrayfield) lost to
A Napoleoni and L Fracassi, 2 and 1; G Campbell (Airdrie) and P
Cunningham (Downfield) lost to P De Salvatore and M Soffietti, 2 and 1;
G Fox (West Kilbride) and C Kelly (Cawder) beat B Padillo and C Zaretti,
2 and 1.
Singles -- S Young beat A Napoleoni, 1 hole; P Cunningham beat L
Fracassi, 2 holes; C Kelly lost to C Zaretti, 2 and 1; O Lindsay lost to
P De Salvatore, 3 and 1; G Campbell beat M Soffietti, 3 and 2; G Fox
beat B Paolillo, 5 and 4.

MARK James, using a long-handled putter for the first time this week,
and David Gilford both shot course-record 65s to finish first and second
in the Moroccan Open at Agadir yesterday.
The seven-under-par final round gave James a 13-under-par aggregate of
275 and a one-shot victory over Gilford, with Robert Karlsson of Sweden
third on 277.
It was the first British success in eight European PGA Tour events
this year and the first victory for 41-year-old James, who lives in
Ilkley, since he won the Canary Islands Open in February, 1993.
James, who had eight birdies in his round and 10 singles putts with
his broom-handled putter, said with his usual dry wit: ''I've been
putting poorly for 18 years so I thought I might as well have a change.
''Last week at home I practised with this long putter on my carpet
which has a hole in it and it seemed quite good. Then I holed a
six-footer on the first hole in the tournament here which set me off and
today I was brilliant.''
Was he embarrassed about using a long putter? ''No,'' said James. ''As
I came off the eighteenth green I just told myself I now belonged to the
Fraud Squad.''
James has always had problems with short putts in the past but
yesterday he knocked in the two or three-footers without a tremor.
He birdied the second, third, fifth and sixth before a bogey at the
ninth took him to the turn in 33. Then he birdied the eleventh, twelfth,
fifteenth, and seventeenth for the seventeenth European Tour victory of
his career.
Gilford and Karlsson, playing in the match ahead, were never out of
the picture.
Karlsson, who finished in 67, led when he reached the turn in 32 but
he could birdie only one hole coming home and had to settle for third
place.
But Gilford, like James, shot the front nine in 33 and the back nine
in 32. At the last hole Gilford sank a 30-foot putt for a birdie 3 which
meant that James had to par the last hole for victory.
Two steady shots on to the green and James two-putted to win the first
prize of #58,330, his last putt being yet another two-footer.
Sam Torrance, who had led overnight, could manage only a 71 for joint
fifth place with Welshman Phillip Price on 280.
Glasgow's Adam Hunter also closed with a 71 to finish one behind
Torrance, and Thornhill's Andrew Coltart (70) was a further stroke
adrift. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
275 -- M James 70, 70, 70, 65 (#58,330).
276 -- D Gilford 71, 71, 69, 65 (#38,880),
277 -- R Karlsson (Sweden) 68, 69, 73, 67 (#21,910).
278 -- A Cejka (Germany) 66, 72, 72, 68 (#17,500).
280 -- P Price 71, 72, 69, 68; S Torrance 67, 70, 72, 71 (#13,540
each).
283 -- R Claydon 69, 75, 69, 70; A Hunter 75, 68, 69, 71 (#9625 each).
284 -- A Coltart 70, 72, 72, 70 (#7820).
Other scores included: 290 -- G Brand Jr 70, 77, 74, 69. 291 -- R

NORTHERN Ireland's Darren Clarke had to settle for a share of second

trying to catch up after the twelfth hole but couldn't.''
Clarke, the overnight leader with eventual winner Clay Devers, posted
a four-round, 11-under-par total of 277 to finish one adrift of the
American at Templer Park Country Club.

THERE are some subtle nuances that have leapt up like early spring
crocuses in the build up to the showdown at Twickers next week.
We find out a lot about ourselves in these times.
On Saturday, we, the press, trooped to Murrayfield -- it would have
been easier to get into Fort Knox -- to interview the players and
management about ''the game.''
Eventually it all went well, the players were up for it for they are a
likeable bunch. Not a glimpse were we allowed of the training, though.
Oh no, this was secret stuff.
Quite rightly, in many ways, the press have been asked to leave the
boys alone, or contact either the SRU's marketing man, or the squad's
agent, instead of the team manager, if communication is required.
Kenny Logan, after all, did 20 interviews last week. He looked
scunnered. It was almost as if he was begging to be asked a different
question.
I can quite understand the sentiments, and I admire the players their
patience, but I sincerely hope that contacting these gents doesn't mean
that this is the start of a successful Scottish side wanting paid to do
interviews, as some have suggested they might.
''How much?'' is one of those funny little questions that no-one likes
to hear.
No doubt they're right -- they have made it big, and they do need
space -- but the press, every avenue of it, gives the individuals
profile. If there were no interviews, the players would belong in the
vacuum of a colourless existence.
Also, and Duncan Paterson has said it himself on many occasions, this
week is absolute proof that the Scottish team needs a full-time manager.
Paterson's very unavailability in this, the most crucial week in the
history of Scottish rugby, is strange. The job cannot be done part-time.
I think we can assume that there will be a highly paid job advertised
for the position in the not-too-distant future. Paterson goes after the
World Cup, this is his last Five Nations' game in charge.
In England, Princess Diana, accompanied by Harry and William, was
allowed into the English session, presumably because the English camp
has become a little jealous of our own Princess Royal, bedecked as she
is in tartan and so obviously a fan of the team when Scotland play. A
battle royal you might say.
Add to that the fact that the fine councillors of Edinburgh wanted the
Lothian and Borders Police Band to go down to Twickenham to play Flower
of Scotland, just to give the lads a wee lift, but it was turned down by
HQ because the Royal Marines had already been booked, and you start to
get the picture that this isn't so much a rugby match, it has become a
series of ritual posturings by two nations who have so many years of bad
blood between them that at times it gets beyond a joke.
Rob Wainwright says that it is all about ''bottle'', and about who
wants the game the most, and he is probably right. Kenny Logan says he
doesn't fear the Underwoods, and the Scottish back row say they should
be more mobile than the English.
We are told that there is bad feeling between Will Carling and Gavin
Hastings, neither one of the two being particularly complementary about
the other in print form.
Jeremy Guscott once accused Scott Hastings of a racial slur.
If we think that the English look on this match as just another game
then we have them wrongly sussed.
Jack Rowell says Gavin is a wonderful person, Will Carling says the
Scottish team is marvellous, it all smells horribly of Scotland's
tactics five years ago.
On Rugby Special, Jeff Probyn lured David Sole to an English pub for a
pint and was very nice to him, despite Sole knocking his pint over as he
walked into the bar...
And yet, I wonder why we hate the English so. They gave us roads and
civilisation, much of the modern world copies their legal and
governmental system.
Our deep and abiding hatred is almost inexplicable.
Despite the fact that they gave us the 1966 Word Cup, we do, as a
nation, hate the English.
They are bigger than us as individuals, and we resent it.
They are richer than us and we hate that too, and, when it comes to
rugby, they drag some of our best players down there to play for their
clubs, and we don't like that at all because we see that our players
become better off for it and play in front of big crowds.
I see no reason to resent this fine English rugby side its success so
far this season, one that is doing well in the PR war before the
conflict.
Only joking, I hate them. But, anyway, it's going to be some week.

Kilmarnock 15, Ayr 29
THE Ayr team's rendition of ''We Are The Champions'' was sung with the
same gusto expressed to achieve victory on the park, and the dressing
room walls took a fair pounding. The celebrations at winning the Third
Division Championship were accompanied at this stage with soft drinks,
but it was their second-half champagne performance that helped them
retain a 100% league record with one postponed match to come.
The Bellsland match was a cracker. It was Ayrshire rugby's equivalent
of an Old Firm football game, played with pride, passion, and punch-ups.
Not serious though.
Few of the big crowd left the ground not feeling they had their
money's worth from a game that had everything. The Killie following will
perhaps feel a bit let down that their heroes did not make it harder for
their rivals.
If Kilmarnock still harboured throughts of their easy victory in the
friendly in January, Ayr still bore a grudge and were determined to put
the record straight.
When Kilmarnock took an eight-point lead and held it at the interval,
even the most loyal of Ayr fans could not begrudge them it. And only the
most stolid of supporters would have predicted the complete
transformation in the second period.
But, with the strong breeze at their backs, Ayr took control and,
although taking the lead and then losing it again, showed the calibre of
their class and belief to run out convincing victors.
Engulfed by his exuberant players at the end, Ayr coach Gordon
Strachan was full of praise for his side.
''They stuck to our policy of playing open rugby,'' he said. ''We
don't like being bogged down to first phase rugby. We go for a second or
third source of supply with the forwards standing off ready to handle
and start moves. It paid off well today, especially after the first half
when we had to fight hard to get any control in the game.
''It was a great last match for Jerry Etheridge who goes back to New
Zealand this week with Jason Barbarich. He is not a big guy and cannot
get too involved in heavy contact, but he us such a shrewd playmaker
that he brings so many other people into the game. I'm delighted the
boys got the title they have worked for.''
Kilmarnock coach John McHarg is nothing if not honest. The expurgated
version of his opinion: ''We were humped. We didn't get into the right
position with the wind at our backs and when Ayr started moving the ball
in midfield, we missed one or two bad tackles that allowed them to get
into scoring position.
''Ayr eventually took control of the lineouts and second phase ball.
Having done that, they fed out at the right time and scores followed.
''It was a mirror image of our last meeting, only this time Ayr got in
among us and did not allow us to settle.
''It was tough luck on the lads but at least we will be stepping up a
league and then we will show them.''
For the opening 10 minutes Ayr looked the more enterprising side, but
Killies' forwards seemed irrepressible and set up an onslaught on the
visitors' line which brought a slick drop goal from Alistair McCall.
The pack tenacity was further rewarded on the half hour when Robin
Carswell got the touch down in a mighty heave over the line. Ayr nearest
attempts were two penalty failures by Etheridge.
After the turn round, Ayr struck two deadly blows in the space of two
minutes and had Killie gasping. George McMillan made up for a previous
fumble by careering down the middle to feed Kenny Nicol who plunged over
with two defenders on his back.
Killie had not got over that one when Ayr hit them again. Etheridge
started the move and finished it with a try on the left. He dutifully
converted from near the touchline.
Kilmarnock were down but certainly not out. They stormed downfield and
the forwards won a penalty try when Ayr dropped the scrum after
incessant peessure. Robbie Stewart converted to restore Killie's lead.
It lasted less than 10 minutes, however, for Ayr's running policy paid
off again with two more tries in four minutes.
A meandering run by Justine Horne set up the score for Geoff Caldwell
then the full back gave the final pass to David Brown to plunge over.
This time Etheridge converted and then concluded the scoring two minutes
from the end with a penalty.
Kilmarnock -- R E Stewart; T Finnigan, P S McIntyre, J C Barrie, J W R
Adams; A W McCall, J C Sharp; J Miller, F Clark, B Milloy, T Adams, S

Gala 36, Currie 15
GALA made such profit from Ian Corcoran's admirable long throwing to
John Amos over the tail and from Robert Hogg's impressive leaping in the
middle as to have the Netherdale game virtually secure at 24-3 by
half-time.
There was something of a tour de force by Corcoran who, in addition to
other accomplishments, showed craft in support positioning that brought
him three tries.
Gala came off their blocks with such purpose as to be 10 points up in
just 12 minutes.
Their forward operations were more productive and they provided a
potent mix of thrust and switch in which Amos was a surging powerhouse,
Mark Ballantyne dealt efficiently with ball in the air, and David
Changleng used a varied repertoire within which he punted with power and
precision although perhaps too much once a cushion had been created.
Currie took quite a while to dispel the notion that they accepted
their fate. Half an hour past before they mounted a concerted handling
attack in which Michael Plumb and Bruce Ward each figured twice.
Once the rangy New Zealander Rees Johnston had started to make
something of a lineout impression -- and Ally Donaldson apparently had
persuaded his colleagues in his half-time chat to move out of first gear
-- Currie began to string some bits and pieces together in subjecting
Gala to occasional spells of siege without quite exhibiting the power
and incisiveness to bring several close-range scrummages and offence
kicks to fruition.
It was late on before, to their credit, they had a try from each of
their wings. Ward competed aggressively throughout, Marrack Tonkin
proved a handful, and Donaldson recovered from occasional
uncharacteristic punt frailty to provide several neat touches in the
Currie rally in which Tonkin and David Wilson went close to score.
Two of Corcoran's tries stemmed from charges by Amos off lineout ball
and switches by Grant Farquharson, the third when he made a blind-side
dart and found the hooker at his elbow.
Two rucks and a cut-back by Brian Swan made the first of Mark
Moncrieff's two tries, the other after Neil Crooks had crashed past
three tackles and Ken Simpson had exploited the Moncrieff acceleration
with a pin-point punt to in-goal.
Michael Dods slotted three penalty goals and one conversion to take
his national league points tally for the season to 75.
Currie were 3-31 adrift before recording their first try. Their
four-man wall at a tap penalty was part decoy, as a switch via Donaldson
and Wilson put Colin Robertson over in the corner.
Then Donaldson, having landed an earlier penalty goal, converted a
smash-and-grab try by Geoff Keen. When Gala handling broke down between
Swan and Simpson, Keen hacked on over 60 metres and got the touch when
the evil bounce evaded Dods. And to think that Keen is a Gala man.
Gala -- M Dods; M Moncrieff, K Simpson, B A J Swan, S S Paterson; D M
Changleng, G C Farquharson; G R Isaac, I Corcoran, A R W Johnston, R B
Hogg, G M Shepherd, M A Ballantyne, N J Crooks, J P Amos.
Currie -- D J Wilson; C Robertson, W M Tonkin, M J Plumb, G W Keen; A
Donaldson, D Rogerson; P R Calder, D G Ellis, J G Stewart, R Johnston, S
C Carson, B W Ward, M Blair, S Hardie.

BOROUGHMUIR and Gala should be playing in the Premier First Division
next season. Both clubs have 15 points which should ensure their place
among the elite. Stirling County and Watsonians have already qualified
which leaves four places remaining to be filled.
Six clubs -- Edinburgh Academicals, Melrose, Hawick, GHK, Heriots, and
West of Scotland -- are contenders for the four places, the two losers
joining Jed-Forest, Dundee HSFP, Currie, and Stewarts Melville plus the
two promoted clubs from the second division, Kelso and Selkirk, in
Premier Two.
The new Division Three will include Biggar, Prestonlodge FP,
Kirkckaldy, Musselburgh, Peebles and Corstorphine with two clubs from
Grangemouth, Glasgow Academicals, Edinburgh Wanderers and Gordonians.
The Premier Fourth Division will comprise the two clubs losing out for
the final two Third Division places plus Haddington and Wigtownshire.
Four clubs are due to be promoted from the present Division Three and
three of these are known -- Ayr, Kilmarnock, and Clarkston -- with the
final place lying between Langholm and Hillhead/ Jordanhill.
Dumfries, Stewartry, Trinity Academicals, Dunfermline, Portobello FP,
Royal High, and Glenrothes are certain to be in the new National League
Division One, with either Langholm or Hillhead/ Jordanhill and Duns or
Livingston joining them.
League placings already confirmed for next season:

* SOUTH African Johannes Ackermann has escaped punishment for
head-butting Dave Sims during Northern Transvaal's 31-21 victory over
Gloucester on Saturday. The 24-year-old lock forward was red-carded at
Kingsholm after an off-the-ball incident, but a disciplinary committee
which could have imposed a suspension ruled that the sending-off was
punishment enough.

Jed-Forest 24, Dundee HS FP 21
IN the event, victory for Jed-Forest was not enough to prevent them
slipping out of next season's top flight, nor would it have been for
Dundee HS FP. However, respective coaches, Donald Miller and Tom Dymock,
were in upbeat mood after an open, entertaining game which could have
gone either way.
''I believe we've turned the corner in terms of our level of
performance,'' said Miller.
According to Dymock: ''We've got to be optimistic, since we have a
number of good young players coming through. It's just a bit galling
that we wouldn't have gone down without league reconstruction.''
Dundee's opening score in just two minutes followed a scrum, when Paul
Rouse ran on to Jon Newton's pass and found Derek Milne in support for a
try which Newton converted.
Two Newton penalties sandwiched a try for Jed in 20 minutes, when
Kevin Amos sent Hogg over.
Chris Richards converted from the touchline, but Dundee held an 18-16
half-time lead thanks to Craig Samson's try.
Dundee had their moments in the second half, but all they could add
was Newton's penalty in 52 minutes, after which Jed stepped up the pace.
David Forster's try from a close-range scrummage levelled the scores,
and Richard's fourth penalty in 67 minutes proved decisive.
As to the future, Miller confirmed that Scotland lock Stewart Campbell
is committed to the club for at least another season, while Miller --
pleased with the Division 1 debut of second-row Alistair Reid-Thomas, a
recruit from Ayr -- reported: ''I'm very hopeful. We are not losing any
players and we'll have a certain Gary Armstrong back.''
Jed-Forest -- C J Richards; K Amos, H G Hogg, S Shaw, M A K Yule; GG
Scott, G Renwick; N A McIlroy, K W Barrie, R J Johnstone, M Pringle, C R

Boroughmuir 18, Hawick 18
CALL it the Great Escape and cast Hawick's freebooting fly-half Scott
Welsh in the Steve McQueen role.
Boroughmuir played most of the rugby, scored three tries to add to
their penalty goal, and should have had the game in the bag well before
no-side. Hawick, though, refused to consider defeat and Welsh's 18
points, from five penalties and a drop-goal, were enough to give them a
share of the spoils and, much more importantly, maintain the drive
towards first division rugby next season.
The Borderers, like Edinburgh Academicals and Melrose, are now on 14
points, which at the beginning of the season, most commentators thought
would have been enough to secure a spot within the top eight of the
existing first division, thus guaranteeing a place in Premier Division
One when the club game undergoes its great upheaval next season.
Now, though, it is not that simple. Hawick occupy seventh slot but
behind them are GHK and Heriot's on 13 and 12 points respectively. Like
Hawick, GHK have just one game to play but Heriot's, with two games,
albeit against Stirling and Melrose, have the potential to finish the
season on the 16-point mark.
All of which makes the encounter between these two old rivals, Hawick
and Gala, at Mansfield Park on Saturday week a choice prospect indeed.
Gala are secure with top-eight status in the bag but, to be sure, Hawick
must win.
At Meggetland on Saturday, Boroughmuir's Bryan Easson had a miserable
afternoon with the boot. With only one success from half a dozen
attempts at goal, his misfortune underlined, once again, that a
regularly reliable goal-kicker is a pre-requisite for ultimate success.
Later, the Hawick coach, Billy Murray, summed up his side's
performance under the category: ''We just kept plugging away.''
Everything, he said, now depended on the Greens beating Gala. ''It was
a bit of a steal today but we refused to give in and every time we got
into their half, Scott kicked the goals. If you can play badly, as we
did today, and still get a draw, then that's no bad thing,'' he said.
The kick which drew the game for Hawick came in the final minute and
in the most controversial of circumstances.
Hawick scrum half Kevin Reid was adjudged by referee Joe Bacigalupo to
have been tripped up, and no sooner had the ball speared between the
uprights than the final whistle sounded.
Welsh had been Hawick's most obvious saviour but the fact that the
Greens had not been blown completely off the park was down to that old
warrior of a wing-forward, Derek Turnbull.
The flanker, who is still desperately seeking recruitment to the
Scotland World Cup squad, laid his body on the line in the Hawick cause
so often that by the end his torso resembled a London Undergound map.
Much of his best work took place in the no-man's-land of ruck and maul
and, as Boroughmuir found to their cost, he is still a mighty difficulty
man to play against.
In view of what was to follow, Easson's third minute penalty goal was
but a false dawn. The game lacked continuity, both sides conceding
penalties with reckless abandon, and it was not until the twenty-seventh
minute that Boroughmuir managed to string together a scoring move.
Sean Lineen was the main orchestrator as he switched scrummage ball
with Macrae while Stark and Reid each played a part before Craig Finnie
went over for the try. Hawick's Greig Oliver was certain that at least
one of the passes had been forward but the touchdown stood.
Just a minute later, Boroughmuir extended their lead when Andy Knight
went over at close quarters from a ruck that followed an Easson break.
Welsh put Hawick on the scoreboard with a penalty goal after 31 minutes
and 'Muir were well in command with a 13-3 lead at the interval.
Nine minutes into the second half Welsh dropped a goal to keep Hawick
in the hunt, and five minutes later, with a thumping penalty goal from
the half-way line, it began to look, for the first time, as if
Boroughmuir would not after all walk away with the laurels.
Hawick's defence was tested to the limit on the hour-mark when Easson
and Stark set Finnie off on a run to the corner but he was bundled into
touch just a metre short. Welsh narrowed the gap to a single point with
yet another penalty goal but soon Finnie was back to that same corner
and, once again, came within a hairsbreadth of scoring and would have
done so had it not been for David Gordon's try-saving tackle.
Stuart Reid made it 18-12 from a try following a lineout on the Hawick
line and, once again, it looked as if the home side were home and dry.
Four minutes from the end, Welsh kicked Hawick back into contention with
his third penalty goal and then, with his dying second penalty attempt,
the stand-off provided the lifeline which keep's Hawick's Premier
Division One hopes alive and, quite literally, kicking.
Boroughmuir -- D Macrae; D A Stark, D Laird, S R P Lineen, C J Finnie;
B R Easson, A Knight; G D Wilson, N R B Dickson, J Davis, D G Burns, P T
Jennings, G Hepburn, S J Reid, G J Drummond. Replacement -- J Wilson for

Stewart's Melville FP 7, GHK 32
CAPTAIN, coach, selector, and motivator, Walter Malcolm was in some
pain with a bruised shoulder at the end of this game, yet he could not
keep the smile off his face. As relief flowed, almost visibly, from the
GHK dressing room, the man of many parts was savouring the moment.
''After having lost an early try I actually thought we played pretty
well. There was a lot of pressure on us -- there still is -- but we have
given ourselves the chance to stay in the Premier Division. George
Breckenridge made an outstanding contribution.''
No-one was disputing that. The angular fly-half claimed 22 points and
he provided the classiest try of the afternoon.
''There's life in the old legs yet,'' declared the 30-year-old. ''We
are going to stay up, I am convinced of that. We will beat Stirling
County in our final league game, so nobody will be able to say we don't
deserve to.'' There's confidence for you.
The Scotland A coach, Hugh Campbell, had done a session at Old
Anniesland last week and his influence was apparent. ''I believe it
important that GHK are in the top league,'' he told me. ''Glasgow needs
two major clubs.''
GHK are far from out of the woods yet, though, having seen this
display, one was left wondering why they had ever strayed into the
forest in the first place. They have a big, mobile pack -- Alan Watt was
throwing his considerable weight about -- which includes an excellent
back row. Malcolm was immense, and the Wallace boys, Fergus and Murray,
were his most able lieutenants.
Cammy Little is a competitive scrum half, Breckenridge the play-maker,
and Gerry Hawkes is not short of pace. Why has it taken a crisis to
deliver the goods? Answers on a post-card.
Stewart's Melville are already en route to Division 2, and it showed.
When a supporter shouted at one of their men, the player yelled back.
That doesn't happen in good teams.
Former Scotland fly-half Douglas Wyllie was making his first league
appearance this year. The slick touches were there but, in racing terms,
he looked the top weight. He will re-emerge.
Graeme Burns is destined for higher things, but whether he cares to
pursue them at Inverleith is a mute point. Alan Kittle is another
promising lad, a speedy prop, no less.
It was he who opened the scoring, taking Peter Flockhart's inside pass
and going over with a shimmy and a sidestep. If I tell that to Ian
McLauchlan, Kittle could be banned from the front-row union.
Fraser Pollock converted the try, but that was to be the home side's
last happy moment. A superb break by Ian McDiarmid set up a GHK try for
Fergus Wallace. Breckenridge, into the teeth of the wind, converted from
far out. The fly-half later added a dropped goal to give his side a
deserved interval lead.
Hawkes was over, but recalled by his own club's touch judge, who was
knocked over in the race for the line. Then three Breckenridge penalties
stretched the differential.
The big man next took possession 35 metres out and simply sailed
through the defence for his try. Another try by Hawkes and a final
Breckenridge goal brought proceedings to a halt.
Stewart's Melville FP -- F Pollock; N J Penny, N Gallagher, P W B
Flockhart, D Bull; D S Wyllie, G G Burns; R McNulty, A Cadzow, A J
Kittle, B Gordon, W Faulds, D Caughey, D Clark, M Paton.

Melrose 22, Stirling County 27
TWO weeks ago, Stirling captain Stewart Hamilton wore a grin the width
of the River Forth after having clinched the Division 1 championship. On
Saturday, the grin was again in evidence -- even though County's win was
only a friendly.
Gary Parker gave Melrose a fourth-minute penalty lead, but the
remainder of the half belonged to County.
Melrose were fast asleep when Mark McKenzie took a quick penalty on
the Melrose 10-metre line to send under-21 centre Matt McGrandles into
score. McKenzie converted.
McKenzie kicked a penalty before Colin MacRobert fed a scoring pass to
No.8 Gareth Flockhart. McKenzie's conversion made it 17-3.
But within 13 minutes of the restart, Melrose had gone ahead.
Ross Brown charged down McGrandles's clearance kick to score between
the posts and three minutes later No.8 Chris Davies added another from a
five metre scrum.
Six minutes after that Robbie Brown went over and two Parker
conversions out of three made it 22-17 to Melrose.
But back came County and a handling move presented Gus Turner with the
opportunity to level the scores. McKenzie's conversion put them ahead
and his later penalty completed the scoring.

Melrose 22, Stirling County 27
TWO weeks ago, Stirling captain Stewart Hamilton wore a grin the width
of the River Forth after having clinched the Division 1 championship. On
Saturday, the grin was again in evidence -- even though County's win was
only a friendly.
Gary Parker gave Melrose a fourth-minute penalty lead, but the

score. McKenzie converted.
McKenzie kicked a penalty before Colin MacRobert fed a scoring pass to
No.8 Gareth Flockhart. McKenzie's conversion made it 17-3.
But within 13 minutes of the restart, Melrose had gone ahead.
Ross Brown charged down McGrandles's clearance kick to score between
the posts and three minutes later No.8 Chris Davies added another from a
five metre scrum.
Six minutes after that Robbie Brown went over and two Parker
conversions out of three made it 22-17 to Melrose.
But back came County and a handling move presented Gus Turner with the
opportunity to level the scores. McKenzie's conversion put them ahead
and his later penalty completed the scoring.

TOMORROW, in a Wellington court house, ''The Beast'' bites back.
The Springbok prop, Johan le Roux, will try to convince the New
Zealand civil courts that the 19-month suspension, imposed last July
when he bit the ear of All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick, was too
harsh.
Le Roux, nicknamed ''The Beast'' on account of his record in South
African domestic rugby, put the bite on Fitzpatrick in full view of the
TV cameras during the Second Test in Wellington, where the All Blacks
clinched the spiteful and bad-tempered series against the touring
Springboks.
Rightly, le Roux was sent home in disgrace, and a NZ RFU judicial
committee, comprising South African tour manager Jannie Engelbrecht, NZ
RFU councillor John Dowling, and independent Wellington lawyer Bruce
Squire, decreed that a 19-month ban was the right-and-proper sentence.
Le Roux was roundly condemned by virtually all and sundry. South
African rugby president Louis Luyt even went so far as to declare that
the player should have been banned for life.
''South Africa has a proud record and tradition and we cannot allow a
player such as this to bring disgrace to our good name. I will not allow
him to play rugby in South Africa again,'' said Luyt.
Before the Wellington hearing in July, the Springbok coach, Kitch
Christie, said that le Roux was for the high jump.
Christie, who is also le Roux's coach with the Transvaal provincial
side, said that the homeward-bound le Roux had suffered a rush of blood
to the head and would have to pay for his actions.
Can this, then, be the same Kitch Christie who was quoted at the
weekend as saying that he wants le Roux back? You bet it was. And him an
expatriate Scotsman from Leith, too.
Unless the New Zealand courts think differently tomorrow, then le Roux
will not be eligible to play again until March, 1996. This means that he
will miss the World Cup which takes place in South Africa this summer.
The Springboks are desperate to put on a good show in front of their
ain volk and it would seem that no stone will remain unturned in pursuit
of the Webb Ellis Cup.
Christie's disgracefully cynical and pragmatic reasoning for wishing
to see le Roux back in Springbok colours runs along the following lines.
One Tommie Laubscher, the le Roux stand-in, has not been coming up to
scratch and, says Christie, they need back-up in the tight-head prop
position. Le Roux, he declares, has indeed been caught and has to pay
the penalty for his moment of madness, but he still has a part to play
in South African international rugby.
Humbug and poppycock. Sean Fitzpatrick is, for sure, no angel, but
what le Roux did disgraced himself, his team and the game.
In the context of what had been a tousy match with villains on both
sides, a life ban would probably have been excessively harsh.
The 19-month sentence was right and proper and the South African coach
is doing himself and South African rugby a grave disservice when he
allies himself with le Roux's cause.
International rugby has probably witnessed more disgraceful scenes
than the bizarre spectacle of le Roux munching on Fitzpatrick's ear as
the pair of them lay on the ground, but this was a high-profile felony
that was shown on TV screens around the globe.
It probably should not matter whether an act of violence is witnessed
by one man and his dog or by a global audience of millions. However, in
the real world it does, and the biter should remain bit.

<HEADLINE>Don't relegate leagues of 10, urges secretary Donald sets out his stall for status quo</HEADLINE>

WITH the potentially ruinous prospect of relegation from the premier
division looming large for several clubs, talk of further revolution was
inevitable. Rather than resolve to play their way out of trouble, many
see league reconstruction as their salvation, while trying to hoodwink
the public into believing their main concerns are for the common good.
If it were truly the case that Scottish football's chairmen were
philanthropists, they would abide by the current set-up which they
themselves agreed upon fewer than 12 months ago. They would give the
set-up at least a second term before condemning it.
They pledged to support four divisions, each of 10 clubs, for a total
of five seasons and while those pushing hardest for change may well be
blessed with a vision far greater than anyone else, the fact is that
change is being discussed with indecent disregard for honesty,
integrity, and credibility.
Credibility is becoming a rare stock these days when so many different
people with disparate views are being asked to attend secret meetings
rather than have some kind of open forum at which all interested groups
could be invited to have their say. Chairmen may believe only they know
how to solve the game's problems, but that is no reason we should
believe them.
While so many appear agitated, at least one man remains
characteristically stoical. Scottish League secretary Peter Donald may
be looking at the world wondering why everyone out there is in such a
hurry, but how anyone can remain so calm and together at a time when the
football seems to be bouncing nowhere in particular is a mystery.
''Am I alarmed that some chairmen have met to discuss
reconstruction?'' Donald repeated the question asked as though amazed
that someone would have the gall to suggest he should be perturbed.
''Alarm would be too strong. Surprised, perhaps, that some members
should meet so quickly after having committed themselves to four
divisions of 10 clubs.''
While others plot and scheme like some of the football agents a few of
them despise, Donald conducts business as usual. But that is part of the
front. His awareness of what is happening, the phone calls being made,
is sharp, and one of the reasons he will never be found hiding in a
basement under West Regent Street is because he knows more than most.
Always shiny and polished, he may look like a freshman, but he is
battle hardened after years of dealing with the egoism which hinders
football's development. Trying to find common ground and regulate
systems designed for the benefit of all when so many around him are
anxious to strengthen their own small parts of the whole isn't a job for
a softy. It requires a strong mind and character.
Donald survives with consumate ease, and believes that despite
meetings and enough hot air to blow up all the balls which would be
needed for an entire premier-division campaign, there will be no
alteration to the current set up. It might not survive five years, but
there will be 10 teams in the top division next season, and nothing will
be done to save Aberdeen, Dundee United, Falkirk or anyone else from
relegation.
''So sure of the current structure were these clubs that they wanted
the set-up in place for at least five years,'' he said. ''It was
acknowledged by all that the league needed stability and it is not
unreasonable to expect that what they were all so certain of should be
given more than three-quarters of the first season to prove its worth.
''I think some people are forgetting economics dictate policy, and in
that respect, the structure has been successful so far. In fact, over
the next four years, a total of #28m should be brought into Scottish
football, and that money will be disbursed among all clubs.
''Also, it should be remembered that the National Lottery is having an
effect on the pools promoters, who put in about #2m a year. They also
fund the Football Trust, who in turn offer grants to clubs redeveloping
their grounds and it is possible that this body might not be able to do
that in future.
''If we were to go to a 16-club top division -- and no-one can prove
football would be better in such a grouping -- we would be expecting
perhaps as many as 20 clubs to have upgraded facilities and, frankly,
Scottish football can't afford that.
''We sold specific packages to sponsors and their money would be
jeopardised by further change.''
It is also the case that constant change would damage the game's
credibility, although a few chairmen, in particular Hearts' Chris
Robinson, would dispute that, but if there is a better way than four
groups of 10, then Donald hasn't come across it yet. ''We have
meaningful matches in all divisions and with most of the season behind
us there are 35 or 36 clubs still playing for something,'' Donald said.
''If you remember, the top clubs last year liked the idea of a top
division of 10, and they were given that, and it appears to be working.
Games are exciting, although I do agree that excitement should not be
confused with quality.
''The Scottish League can only provide the set-up requested by the
member clubs and that is what we have done. However, to say that the
public don't like what they are seeing may not be strictly true, because
figures suggest otherwise.''
A glance at records show that in season 1974-75, average attendances
were much lower than the average numbers today. If anything, these
statistics would show the game suffered from greater apathy than today,
but there is no doubt managers and players are unhappy with the
structure and complain they are being restricted.
The common lament is pressure, and fear of losing games and jobs
prevent the introduction of young players and the employment of tactics
which might make games more open and attractive. But Donald has
difficulty reconciling larger divisions with an automatic improvement in
quality and a lowering of teams' average ages.
''I just don't see it,'' he said. ''Pressure is a part of the game and
even if tension could be removed, no-one could say that would suddenly
create better football, because the problem in terms of quality may run
much deeper. It might have something to do with the way players are
taught.
''Individual skills here are not as finely honed as they should be and
while on the Continent teams try to prevent you from winning by using
tactics and their own talents, we tend to stop the other side from
playing by running fast and tackling.
''A great deal of effort is put in by players and managers in
Scotland, but the net outcome doesn't always match that input.''
Clearly, Donald believes refinement and greater attention to youth
development will improve the standard of player in the Scottish game,
and he would rather see people concentrate on that, but he realises
reconstruction will always be discussed, openly or otherwise. ''I can
understand clubs who fear they may lose their top-division status being
worried, but that is part of what we are about,'' Donald said.
''There would be little point if there was no relegation and smaller
clubs were denied opportunities to progress. The current structure still
seems to me to be the best one and I believe we will still be using it
next season, simply because the big clubs don't want to change.
''Part of the problem might be that there is a high turnover in
boardrooms as well as on playing staffs and perhaps some directors don't
know what it was like when there was a larger division in the mid
'70s.''
If anyone cares to give him a call, Donald will gladly spell out the
facts of football life.

ON St Patrick's Day, 1990 a spontaneous cheer went up in one of the
more douce establishments in Edinburgh. The news had just filtered
through to Jenners that Scotland had beaten the English to capture the
Grand Slam.
They say people always remember where they were when JFK died, and
similarly few rugby enthusiasts will forget the celebrations that
followed the famous, but unexpected triumph at Murrayfield.
Feelings had been running high. The over-confident English press
thought the result was a foregone conclusion; it was merely a question
of how many points there would be between their team and the lowly
Scots.
Then David Sole and his men marched out one by one like gladiators to
show that they had no intention of rolling over, and within two hours,
victory was theirs.
The English supporters who had already bought their Grand Slam ties
were offering to sell them to the jubilant Scots for 10p as they trudged
home to think again.
Looking back, Sole says he remembers very little about the actual game
except the overwhelming atmosphere.
Of the decision to march out one by one, he says: ''I felt we had to
make some kind of gesture along the lines of 'here we are, come and get
us.' Probably it was something really for the crowd.'' It certainly
worked.
On Saturday, Gavin Hastings will lead his men out on to the Twickenham
pitch. Months ago, few would have thought it possible for the Scots to
have got so far until that victory in France.
Sole believes that the situation is similar to 1990 in many ways.
''Again, all the pressure is on the English to win,'' he said.
''Justifiably so, because they have played some very good rugby. Having
said that Scotland have also played some very good rugby this year,
which is in contrast to five years ago.
''We had been winning matches, but we hadn't really played terribly
well, whereas this particular Scottish side have improved with every
game. Having won in Paris, there is a little more realistic expectation
that the Scottish side can do quite well.''
Sole believes that a lot of people down south have learned their
lesson. He sees one of the greatest dangers as the ability of English
coach Jack Rowell to manage people. ''Leaving aside his technical
ability, the resurgence of English rugby has very much been a testament
to his ability to motivate players, and to give them the self belief to
play the kind of game they like to play.''
Meanwhile, the Scots have surprised everyone. Sole admits that he has
been less than complimentary about the team, but says things have turned
around dramatically.
''The young blood has been a turning point They've surprised everyone.
It was a huge achievement to beat the French in Paris.''
''Now they've got a side with a balanced back row, players who can win
ball in the lineout, and Damian Cronin's experience has been
invaluable,'' says Sole. ''Gavin has proved inspirational, and has
slotted goals which have kept us in the game.''
What advice would he give to Hastings?
''I don't think he would take any advice from me,'' he said, laughing,
''but he just has to go out there and do what he's been doing all year
and slot his goals and keep himself and his players, totally focussed.
It's a bit like an SAS raid. You're in and out and you've achieved your
objective and then you can relax and enjoy it.''
The crucial question is can they win?
''I don't see why not,'' says Sole. ''You can effectively disregard
the form book. Everything that has gone before in the Five Nations'
Championship is totally irrelevant. It comes down to a cup final --
upsets do happen. They've already happened this year and there's no
reason why they can't happen again.''
''Having won away from home already, the team know what it's all about
and Twickenham is no different from Paris.
Sole gave up his playing career at the peak of his abilities and does
not regret the decision. All his memories are of a different
Murrayfield.
''I always said I would give up rugby when I stopped enjoying it, and
I reached a stage where that was true. Sure, it would be great to pull
on a Scotland jersey and run on to the pitch for an international in
front of 60,000 people because it's a huge buzz. But that's not all
there is to it. There's the training and commitment.''
He decided that the sacrifices to career and family were too much.
Sole will be at Twickenham on Saturday to do a radio commentary and to
cheer on the Scots. Let's hope they're cheering in Jenners again.

BILL McMurdo is the first football agent to come through the SFA's new
procedure and prove his fitness to wheel and deal on behalf of his
clients. Part of the process was sitting an oral exam.
We asked Mr McMurdo how it had been for him. "It was a bit like having
to sit your quali at the age of 50," he said. For the benefit of younger
readers, the quali is an exam which us old folk used to have to sit in
the last year of primary school.
''There were a few questions about FIFA regulations and contract
law.'' Easy meat for a chap like McMurdo who has been doing all this
stuff as an agent for 18 years.
Remarkably, Mr McMurdo passed, despite telling his SFA examiners
rather forcefully in the course of the oral that the whole thing was
''complete nonsense.''
The written part of the SFA agent exam is quite straightforward, as
long as you have access to loads of money. You simply have to hand over
a bit of paper lodging a #100,000 bond.
McMurdo, famous for his predilection for things red white, and blue,
told the Sporting Diary: ''When they mentioned a bond, I immediately
thought of Larkhall and flutes.''
* WHEN it comes to big sporting events taking place in far-flung and
expensive places, mere mortals can only look on in envy at the fans with
typewriters, or sports journalists as they are also known.
Another fortunate category are those captains of industry or well-off
self-employed who find urgent business reasons to travel to locations
remarkably close to where major sporting occasions are taking place.
To this list, we can now add sociologists. A team of researchers from
Aberdeen University found it necessary to be in New York and Orlando
during the World Cup last year to study the behaviour of the Irish
football fans.
The report from these fans with clipboards is now in. Among the
discoveries made by the Aberdeen sociologists, with our own simplistic
analysis:
* Ireland's fans' culture is largely an extension of the Irish
carnivalesque. (Irish football fans are a sociable bunch who like a wee
drink and a song.)
* The Irish ''were not consistently involved in interaction with
opposing fans. Apart from downtown Orlando, there were few public
rituals of extended communication and exchange...'' (Unfortunately, the
Irish lads didn't get a chance to mingle with the girls from Brazil).
* The Irish fans travelling to the USA had a very broad age, gender,
and social class composition. (There's the oul fella off to New York,
but he's having to take herself because of the money she's skinned out
of the housekeeping).
* The World Cup underlined the game's function in allowing the Irish
to express non-political sentiments of national and cultural identity.
(''Jack's the Man! Ole! Ole! Ole!....'' Irish fan celebrates another
fabulous draw, pausing only to buy a pint of stout for the queer fella
sociologist from Aberdeen who keeps asking silly questions).
* THE chain letter has entered the world of golf. The scam is called
the Worldwide Golf Ball Club. Members are press-ganged when they receive
a letter, usually from an apologetic friend or business colleague.
The deal is that you send three ''quality'' golf balls to the previous
person in the chain. Then you send a letter to eight friends or
colleagues with your own name and that of the ''chum'' who got you
involved in the first place.
According to the bumf: ''Within three weeks, you should receive 192
golf balls. Seldom does anyone drop out because most golfers can use 192
for the price of three.''
As well as relying on friendship, the system thrives on superstition
as to what might happen if the chain is broken. This could be
particularly nasty in the case of the Worldwide Golf Ball Club when a
severe dose of the shanks might result.
* PRIZE for the most contrived contribution of the week goes to Ronnie
McLean of East Kilbride. It is on the subject of last week's Italian
Serie A match in which Lazio beat Fiorentina 8-2. Brutus, a Fiorentina
fan, asks his pal Caesar, being a Roman and a Lazio man, the result of
the match. ''Et tu, Brute,'' Caesar replies.
* COLLEAGUE Jim Reynolds, recently returned from Atlantic City, New
Jersey, where he covered the Gary Jacobs fight, brings back a cutting of
an article in the local newspaper. It is all about how boxers need more
protection from the rapacious sorts who presently control the sport's
finances. Laudable stuff, even if written by a chap who rejoices in the
name Joesph Maffia.
* THE scene is Tonnelli's, a delightful Italian restaurant in Easter
Road, last Saturday lunchtime before the Hibs-Rangers match. Into the
busy ristorante walks a squad of Scotland's finest football writers.
(Squad? there must be a more appropriate collective noun, but for the
moment it escapes us).
Would they like a table at the Rangers or Hibs end, the waiter asks.
We are football-writing gentlemen of the press, one replies. That'll be
the Rangers end, says the percipient waiter.

MANY people have recently voiced their opinion on the need for
fundamental change in the way we develop Scottish football. Many I
believe through fear pay the ideas lip service. How many are actually
doing anything to accelerate the necessary changes. Fundamental change
in any sphere must be driven by those in control.
Why have teams in the lower leagues become pastures for fallen idols
and old pros on the way out. Directors and owners of these clubs should
accept that they must act as ''feeders'' for the big boys; that by
attracting transfer fees for young players they can survive. They cannot
survive on gate money or by paying inflated salaries to players on the
way out. Where is the return in that?
Young managers should be brought in and given time to ring the
changes. This in turn will bring a generation of commercially aware
managers able to move on to bigger clubs. It would bring through
generations of players who have developed skills as they have physically
developed against players of roughly the same age. We would not burn
them out. We seem quite capable of development to under 16 and under 18
level but then what?
Would making the second and third divisions under 23 with two over-age
players be too radical? A certain side in the lower divisions has had
four managers in two years. Why? Where are they going? What are they
trying to achieve? At best they can attain mediocrity.
It is up to owners and directors to stop using clubs to massage egos,
they must instigate change. Let's for once be proactive, let's stop
waiting for embarrassment before we verbally, at least, react.
Why shouldn't Rangers tie up a deal with Albion Rovers that for
financial input they get first option on talent. Why shouldn't Celtic
pay the wages of promising talent anywhere with a view to their
development and possible signing.
Not all new ideas will work but we will only go backwards if we all
stand off and say what can I do. We go nowhere if we stand back thinking
I wish we were Ajax.
David McNair, 41 Paisley Road, Barrhead, Glasgow.
Choking the system
JUNIOR football and its ability to canvass the amateur grades for
talent, is one of the founding strengths of the Scottish game. The
demise of its intention has seriously weakened our capacity to convey
gifted players to the top clubs.
Why has no-one identified this as a weakness in our present state of
affairs? Isn't it obvious that if these clubs habitually sign veteran
seniors (a trend started by Cambuslang Rangers in the late sixties) then
the system will be choked?
Most clubs who could, followed Cambuslang's lead from the seventies
onwards. Considering an efficient youth policy would take around 10
years to come to fruition, you would expect that the decay of such a
policy would require the same duration. Why then, from the eighties
onwards, have we experienced a lack of talent?
Doubtless you journalists will go on bleating about the faults of our
premier division, but you can't suppress talent. Had we sown in the
eighties, we would reap in the nineties.
Stuart Manson, 56 Barlae Avenue, Eaglesham.
Only 1.77% for juniors
JAMES Traynor, in reply to the letter from Drew Cochrane (March 6),
has the arrogance to state that The Herald has been covering junior
football since the relaunch of its sports section.
In the edition of March 6, 1995, 0.75% of the total section was on
junior football, or 1.77% of the football coverage only. Of this 28[1/2]
column inches coverage, 5[1/4] was of results available elsewhere the
previous day; 6 was of real news, the draw for the quarter final ties,
and no one game merited more than 1[1/2] column inches on its own.
Look at the attendances at many of the junior games compared to the
second and third divisions, and ask the junior fans if this is real
''coverage'' Mr Traynor.
Archie Currie, 2 Dipple Court, Kilbirnie.
Bring back bare knuckles
TO make boxing safer, all that is required is to throw away the
gloves, thereby returning to the bare-knuckle format. Overnight, this
prescription would cause the incidence of brain damage to fall by a
factor of 10, as anyone foolish enough to punch his full weight would
certainly smash his own hands painfully beyond repair.
Thus boxing would be restored to the boxers, and the sluggers could
take up gardening.
Undoubtedly there would be much more visible blood in the ring and a
vastly greater number of pugilists with warthog-like faces would
assuredly appear.
Yet most damage would be superficial and few fighters would end up as
ugly as the average front-row forward.
Brian D Finch, 20 Whitelaw Street (1/1), Maryhill, Glasgow.
Boli's big moment
IAN Paul asserts that ''no French team has ever won the Champions'
Cup'' (March 1). That must have come as a surprise to Rangers' Basile
Boli, who was under the impression that he had headed the only goal of
the 1993 European Cup final for Marseille against AC Milan.
Perhaps this achievement has been erased from the history books amid
the recriminations over the Marseille match-fixing scandal, but however
brief their glory may have been, no-one can deny that Marseille did
become the first French team to lift the famous trophy.
Alan Hendry, 50 Willowbank, Wick.
Ian Paul replies: Marseille were stripped of their title after
allegations of match-fixing and are not recognised official winners. It
is the case, therefore, that no French team has won the Champions' Cup,
but it is also true Marseille did beat AC Milan in the final.
First to see the light
YOUR distinguished correspondent Martin Smith, past president of
Queen's Park Football Club, was quite correct in his letter (February
27) to dismiss comparisons between Stenhousemuir's 2-0 Scottish Cup
defeat of Aberdeen and the 1-0 defeat of Rangers by Berwick Rangers in
the national competition in 1967 -- the very real possibility exists
after all that both Stenhousemuir and Aberdeen will be playing in the
same division next season!
It is not, however, factually correct to state that the Stenhousemuir
v Hibernian fixture of November 7, 1951, was the first game between two
Scottish senior clubs under floodlight.
Martin Smith may be interested to learn that on November 4, 1878, the
first Hampden Park housed a match under ''electric light'' in which the
long-lamented Third Lanark defeated Rangers 3-2. Almost 10 years later,
the first Ibrox Park, was ''bathed in artificial sunlight'' provided by
Messrs Braby &amp; Co as Rangers defeated the Scottish Corinthians 4-1 on
March 8, 1888, and on November 6 that same year the Glasgow Herald
advertised a ''Great Football Match With The Aid Of The Wells Light''
between Vale of Leven and Rangers in conjunction with the International
Exhibition at Kelvingrove.
Robert McElroy, Editor, The Rangers Historian, 21 Cornaig Road,

Rules worth reviving
I WAS most interested to read a booklet written in 1930 on Cardross
Golf Club which celebrates its centenary this year. There were special
rules for four-ball matchplay:
1. The owner of a ball played out of bounds shall take no further part
in the play of the hole.
2. Only the owner and his caddie may look for a lost ball.
3. No player in any circumstances may play ''two more'' than his
partner.
4. Every player should take the earliest opportunity of picking up his
ball when his partner needs no further assistance.
5. A fourball match must stand aside to allow a twoball match to pass,
without request.
If these rules were in general use today, rounds of three-and-a-half
hours and more would be unknown.
W M McCash, Redclyffe, Peel Street, Cardross.
More talk, less action
I THOUGHT it strange that James Traynor should paint a picture of the
men from FIFA as a bunch of petty pedantic bureaucrats in Monday's
Herald.
Compared to our very own Jim Farry these guys are Anarchist Liberal
Commie Hippies. Their concern for the game of football is genuinue and
the much tinkering of rules can only improve what has become in this
country 90 minutes of sheer, raw, undiluted torture no matter which
ground you are at.
Traynor says there is ''too much talking and not enough action in
football'' but if we are to use the Scottish game as an example then I
would say there is too much action and not enough talking.
If the herd of 22 elephant men that we see charging around
indiscriminately on our pitches of a Saturday afternoon were to stop for
a moment, sit round the centre circle and talk, it could only benefit
the game.
Some questions they might raise -- What happened to our skill? Maybe
we should think before we pass . . . What is to dribble? If Joao
Havelange and Sepp Blatter are reading, I beg you . . . Tinker to your
hearts' content.
Please give me more subs. More advertising. Timeouts. Hotdogs.
Lookalikes . . . Anything . . . Anything to distract from the football.
Greg Hemphill, Off The Ball, BBC Scotland.

WHEN Scotland manager Craig Brown embarked on his European
Championship qualifying campaign, he did so with the core of his squad
coming from Pittodrie.
Now, six months down the line, and failure looming to qualify for the
finals in England in 1996, Brown must pick another squad to travel to
Moscow later this month while his Aberdeen players are battling to avoid
relegation.
Brown's anxiety at this turn of events was plain at the weekend when
he missed cup games at home and in England to watch the
bottom-of-the-table clash at Firhill.
The problems which took him to Maryhill were all paraded, and there
was nothing in the game which could have settled his mind.
Beforehand, Brown told me: ''These are good players we are talking
about in the Aberdeen team. What I have to hope is that they start to
put things together -- and, even if they don't, that a break from the
premier division will restore their confidence.''
After the game, it is doubtful that Brown would be as willing to take
that risk, as he had watched a handful of his international hopefuls
squander a two-goal lead to remain in deep trouble.
Eoin Jess is the biggest engima of all. A year ago, Aberdeen were
talking in terms of #3m as a possible transfer valuation if they were
ever going to sell him.
Brown -- and Andy Roxburgh before him -- saw in Jess an ability which
made him adapt easily to international football. There was a touch of
class about the youngster who was once released by Rangers.
Yet in his last two games --both in Glasgow -- Jess has been a sad,
anonymous figure. Against Celtic at Hampden, he was pushed wide on the
right and rarely influenced the game, looking, instead, as if he felt he
should be playing in another position.
At Firhill, he sat on the bench only making an appearance in the
closing eight minutes when the teams were level and giving Brown little
opportunity to assess him.
While his talents are being rapidly marginalised, Brown must decide
whether he can take a chance on a player who, quite clearly, is doing
nothing to convince his club manager that he can help to save the team
from relegation.
The player's former manager, Willie Miller, made a few pertinent
points at the weekend about the ''young players'' at Pittodrie and the
golden future they promised the club.
Said Miller: ''None of the players have fulfilled their potential.
These players, Jess, Booth, Wright, and Smith, can no longer be called
'young.'
''Part of the problem has been that younger players, because of the
lack of quality around, can walk straight into the international team
nowadays. That didn't happen when I was a player. Then, you had to wait
your turn, you sometimes had to bite your lip because you felt you were
better than the players who were in the Scotland team, but you couldn't
say so.
''Being able to get into the Scotland team so quickly is not a good
thing.''
It's also something that has increased the pressure on Brown. In the
current qualifying games, he has leaned heavily on Aberdeen, just as he
has done since being appointed international team manager. Can he still
do so?
Can he pick Jess when his club has lost faith in him?
Can he pick defenders Wright, Brian Irvine, and Stewart McKimmie when
they couldn't even defend a two-goal lead at Firhill?
He can, of course. But between now and next Monday he has to decide
whether he can afford to do that.
This week Brown must speak to the man in charge at Aberdeen, Roy
Aitken, who was one of his and Andy Roxburgh's most trusted on-field
lietenants not so long ago.
He must find out from him what has gone wrong with Jess and why his
talents seem to have suddenly withered.
The thought of any of the three, who have been in previous Brown
squads, trying to curb the likes of Andrei Kanchelsis in Moscow is more
than worrying. It is frightening.
At the moment Brown insists: ''I feel confident about going to Moscow.
We do have our share of problems and Aberdeen's situation is one of
them.
''I still believe, though, that a change of environment, can bring
back a player's form. I'm looking at lads who have never let me down at
international level and that has to come into my thinking.
''The international stage is different, a whole lot different, from
the way the game is played week after week in the top 10.''
The Scotland coach is right about that. However, the demands in Moscow
will be severe and defeat could sentence Scotland to being mere
onlookers when the European finals are staged across the Border.

I GET all the big games. This weekend it was Rangers and Celtic. At
Ibrox. Under floodlights. It was, it was.
Except that it was across the road from the noble frontage of the
Rangers footy club, and it was the Rangers and Celtic catering staff who
were challenging each other for the trophy. More of the trophy later.
The catering people of Rangers and Celtic are perhaps more important
than you think, for the days are long past when football revenue came
through a simple turnstile.
Today it comes through the turnstiles of television, pools, corporate
entertainment, but more than that, through the remarkable restaurant and
other facilities which these huge stadiums can offer.
Today's football relies on more than football, and indeed the business
of football is much to do with business now, and business likes to
lunch, and Celtic and Rangers knows that full well.
So there we have a whole wheen of catering girls and boys employed by
the Old Firm clubs. And then we have two teams, Rangers and Celtic,
playing against each other, the catering people. On Sunday, across from
Ibrox Stadium.
Well, the boys were out on Sunday representing the two teams, mostly
waiters and electricians and the like and nae women, (the girls it
appears have their own teams), and playing for charity, in this case the
Scottish Bobath Association.
This is an organisation for children suffering from Cerebral Palsy,
and the Bobath therapy can help such children considerably. They do well
in fund-raising but need more. They want #175,000 to buy over a property
in Knightswood, so they are trying to raise it. Rather a pity that,
despite the efforts of all concerned, too few attended this match.
Rather a pity, too, that not a single Celtic or Rangers player or
official appeared at this splendid match which Rangers, incidentally,
won 4-2.
After all, both clubs are noted for their generosity in charity
matters and had supplied the strips and venue, and floodlighting. The
odd player there would have made the parents who strove so hard glow
even more.
Wee Kendall Porter, aged six, and the mascot for Rangers, herself a
very pretty little girl who suffers from this dreadful affliction, I am
sure would like to have seen the odd player about.
But there were certainly some odd players.
Big Tam, of the Rangers, claimed he could only play the first half,
but he played well. Och so did they all. Irwin, Mitchell, Duncan and
Colin Stewart, (with a soft penalty if you ask me), scoring for the
Gers, and Gary Barton and Gordon Thomson, who happens to be my
downstairs neebor, scoring for the Hoops.
It was a tight game, with a startling performance by Gordon
McAllister. Best performances, though, were definitely that of the ref,
Peter Hardie, and his stalwart linesmen, Brian and Steve. No. Best
performance of the day had to be that of PC Brian Ferguson. I'm saying
that because he is the only polis I ever met who seemed to be wee-er
than I am.
But there were a lot of great performances. How about Hayley Arthur of
first year at Lenzie Academy who is wee Kendall's pal?
Or Allan Burns, of the Bobath Committee, and him an ex-Allan Glen's
boy, what else, whose daughter Marion suffers from Cerebral Palsy?
Or Donnie Torrance, of Rangers' catering staff, who took the idea of
this game on board (Celtic host the Old Firm match next year).
Best performance really was by local retired businessman and well-kent
figure John McLaughlin, who not only contributed the trophy but made it
as well. It is a lovely work of art, consisting of a semi-styled Jules
Rimet cup, made of wood though.
John makes things out of wood. People like him make things out of the
best material of all -- thoughtfulness. When the hordes are at each
others throats in the Big Game you get to realise what the Big Game
really is. What sport is. I do get to the big games after all, at that.

THE challengers continue to be vanquished by a Huntly side which is
beginning to run out of tests in this league. It is four months and 17
games since a side other than Dundee United overcame the Aberdeenshire
part-timers.
After a 5-2 hammering of second-placed Peterhead, Huntly manager Steve
Paterson was in confident enough mood to discuss the long-term prospects
for his club and, dauntingly, the others. ''There seems to be a big gap
between ourselves and the bulk of the rest of the league,'' he said.
Peterhead flirted with the idea of an upset as they went two up, but
that provoked Martin Stewart (2), Brian Thomson (2), and Marco De Barros
into a demolition job.
The champions are now three points clear with five games in hand.
Interim manager Neil Mackintosh saw his Elgin City side slump 3-0 in
the Moray derby at Lossiemouth, who scored through Scott Patterson (2)
and Gary Clark.
Buckie Thistle cantered to their biggest win of the season with a 7-1
defeat of Nairn County, with Gordon Robertson getting a hat trick, and
Kevin Mann two.
Stuart Golabeck and John Seaton netted in Clach's 2-0 win over Rothes,
while Paul Bridgeford and Murray Ritchie gave Deveronvale a 2-0 win at
home to Fort William.
Forres beat Brora Rangers thanks to a Mark Stewart goal, while
Fraserburgh and Wick Academy finished goalless.

FORMER Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson added to his status as a folk
hero at Everton by setting up the only goal in the FA Cup sixth-round
defeat of Newcastle at Goodison Park yesterday.
In the semi-final, the Merseyside club will play Tottenham, who had
achieved a stunning victory 24 hours earlier away to Liverpool.
That leaves Manchester United, 2-0 winners over Queen's Park Rangers,
with the softest option -- a tie against the winners of the replay
between Crystal Palace and the only first division survivors, Wolves.
Ferguson, playing as a lone central striker between two wide men, was
once again Everton's main threat yesterday, with virtually every ball
out of defence aimed at his head. In 66 minutes he climbed highest to
knock down Unsworth's free-kick and centre-half Dave Watson was able to
direct a header of his own into a corner of the net.
Ferguson's supremacy in the air had set up their best opportunity of a
lively first half too, when Stuart Barlow latched onto his flick and set
the crossbar twanging. Newcastle, lacking the injured Peter Beardsley,
enjoyed plenty of possession but found Welsh keeper Neville Southall in
defiant mood.
Manchester United had things mostly their own way against QPR. Having
effectively beaten Leeds in the first four minutes of the previous
round, when they scored twice, United had to be only a little more
patient yesterday before Lee Sharpe made a breakthrough.
United increased their lead in 52 minutes with a characteristic
swerving free-kick from Denis Irwin. Rangers were denied the goal they
deserved for their tenacity when Peter Schmeichel saved from Les
Ferdinand in the last few minutes.
The dream-like quality of Tottenham's win at Anfield added to the
growing conviction that theirs is the name on the cup this year. It was
their first victory in the competition against Liverpool, who until
Saturday had been beaten once in 24 matches, and it came with all the
added drama of a last-minute goal from Jurgen Klinsmann.
Earlier, after Mark Walters, another former Ibrox player, brilliantly
set up Robbie Fowler to score for Liverpool, Klinsmann had put Teddy
Sheringham in for an equally well-taken equaliser.
With Spurs' followers looking forward to a replay on their own
territory, Sheringham returned the compliment with the deftest of flicks
that the German clipped past David James. ''That was my greatest moment
since coming to England,'' said Klinsmann.
Saturday's other tie was muck-and-nettles stuff, as Crystal Palace and
Wolves ground out a 1-1 draw. Northern Ireland cap Iain Dowie scored for
Palace, inevitably following a set-piece, and 36-year-old Gordon Cowans
equalised after having fouled Palace's Damien Mathew, who he caught in
possession outside the penalty area.
What neither side really wanted was a replay, for both are well behind
in terms of matches played as they struggle, respectively, to stay in
the Premier League and win promotion to it.
Palace are optimistic that their striker, Chris Armstrong, will be
back for the replay, though the English FA still have not disclosed how
much longer his suspension for taking cannabis must last.
Blackburn could have moved six points clear of Manchester United in
the league, but managed only a 1-1 draw at Coventry, with questions
about the legality of Alan Shearer's goal.
West Ham staggered out of the bottom four with a 2-2 draw against
Norwich, but believe they suffered from a bizarre case of mistaken
identity. After a bad foul on Tony Cottee, replacement referee Martin
Sims sent off Norwich's Andy Johnson instead of the real culprit,
defender Spencer Prior, who stayed on to keep the London side at bay.

REAL Madrid's players are now owed #5m in unpaid salaries because of
the club's deepening financial crisis.
While the Bernabeu club put together a rescue operation under Spain's
former finance minister Juan Miguel Villar, one of their
vice-presidents, the players have resisted a strike call in order to
regain the championship.
Chilean Ivan Zamorano, their leading scorer, admitted: ''If we were
not so successful I would have walked out. But to go on strike now, when
we ahead in the championship, would be ruining our future.
''There is a very real chance that we can end Barcelona's domination.
If we win the championship it will help pull the club out of debt and we
realise that measures are now being taken to pay our wages.''
Real scored first but slumped to a 3-1 defeat at Racing Santander
yesterday, but kept their lead in the title chase because Barcelona,
four points behind, and Deportivo Coruna, a further point adrift, also
suffered away defeats. Deportivo lost 1-0 in Zaragoza, where the home
side's Santiago Aragon and Javier Aguado and Deportivo defender Donato
all were sent off in the closing half-hour.
Madrid vice-president Villar indicated that if his club qualify for
the Champions' League next season, their debts of around #30m could be
wiped out within four years.
He added that the success of Celtic's recent share launch had been
studied and was one of the options now under consideration.
Meanwhile, Barcelona's Hristo Stoichkov was able to dig into his
wallet for #2m to help his former club, CSKA Sofia. The Bulgarian club's
plan to go public found little response until Stoichkov intervened to
buy a 10% stake.
Thousands then followed his example and the scheme was a sell-out.
Stoichkov said: ''I acted to help my old club because they made me the
player I am today.''
* THE derby between FC Porto and Benfica is statistically the worst in
Europe. Last week's affair, won 2-1 by Bobby Robson's side, had two
players sent off -- and 15 others booked.In five games between the clubs
this season, the crime count now stands at 12 red cards and 45 yellows.
Internationalist Secretario, of Porto, one of the players sent off a
week ago, admitted: ''There cannot be a more vicious game anywhere in
football. It is a miracle no-one has been killed because so much hatred
exists between us.
''I have been kicked, bitten, and spat at. Nothing can surprise me now
and nothing will ever change. Feelings run too deep.''
* AC MILAN and Genoa have each been fined #20,000 for their part in
the rioting at their Serie A match earlier this year in which a young
fan was murdered. Both clubs have also been ordered to play two league
games on neutral venues, including Milan's match against leaders
Juventus.
Roberto Baggio marked his first league appearance for more than three
months by scoring from a free kick as Juventus beat Foggia 2-0 to keep
their four-point lead over Parma yesterday.
Fabrizio Ravanelli had grabbed the first for Juve and, in between the
goals, Foggia defender Pasquale Padalino was sent off on the hour mark.
Parma made hard work of a 3-2 home win over erratic Sampdoria after
having led 2-0 in 22 minutes through goals by Gianfranco Zola and
Colombian Faustino Asprilla.
After the break Sampdoria levelled through an Attilio Lombardo penalty
and a Ruud Gullit goal before Zola struck the winner in 75 minutes, just
after having missed from the spot. Sampdoria's veteran defender Moreno
Mannini receiving the red card 13 minutes from time.
* JOHN Constantine, president of the Australian FA, has resigned in
the wake of a judicial inquiry which revealed irregularities in the
transfer of international players to foreign clubs.
* SCANDAL has forced former East German coach Bernd Stange to quit as
technical director at Hertha Berlin. An investigation by Stern Magazine
has exposed his close links with the Stasi, the secret police
responsible for a regime of terror and atrocities.
Defender Jurgen Kohler, passed over for the captaincy of Germany, has
stepped up his feud with coach Berti Vogts by announcing he will quit
the international scene after the European Championship finals.
* SCOT Alistair Dick, whose career included spells with Tottenham and
Ajax, has signed for Seven Stars, a second-division club in Cape Town,
South Africa.
* PANATHINAIKOS, the runaway league leaders in Greece, have the best
defensive record of any top club in Europe. It is 796 minutes since they
last conceded a goal and have lost only nine in 22 league games.
FC Nantes have also created a new record in France by stretching their
unbeaten run to 28 games under coach Jean-Claud Guaudeau.

STRANRAER manager Alex McAnespie does not have his troubles to seek.
With relegation to the second division staring them in the face, his
side have the added problem of facing the wrath of the authorities after
yet another two of his side were ordered off in the clash against St
Mirren at Stair Park.
This takes Stranraer's total of red cards this season to 10 --
remember the battle of Broadwood against Airdrie when four bit the dust
-- and now equal at the top of the bad boys' league with Cowdenbeath.
Yet McAnespie was determined to make one point. ''This is a team game.
We recognise this, and so did St Mirren. The officials also must play a
team game. The linesmen must help out the man in the middle.''
The Stranraer manager then had to put a damper on his comments, but it
is possible that he was referring to a situation where his defender was
caught on the ground with the ball caught between his thighs.
Apparently, to say there was a scramble is putting it mildly, but it
seems that a linesman standing close to the incident took no action.
The end result, however, of a tetchy game was early baths for home
players Darren Henderson and Kenny Brannigan, and Saints -- what a
misnomer on the day -- David Byrne, allegedly for fighting off the ball,
and Steve Watson, for a second bookable offence.
It was a particularly tough red card for Henderson, just back after
having been out for 15 weeks following a stomach operation. And
according to McAnespie, all he was trying to do was to calm down a bit
of an on-field barney.
For Saints, the goals by Robert Dawson from the penalty spot, Watson
and Alex Bone took them above Ayr United into third-bottom place.
Henderson had the opening strike for Stranraer.

Clydebank 1, Ayr United 1
FOOTBALL managers can use a wide and varied collection of adjectives
to describe their team's performance after a match. Some can be
long-winded while others are eloquent enough, but a little more to the
point.
And then there are guys like Brian Wright, the main man at Clydebank,
who, when asked to sum up the day's work of his men against Ayr United
at the weekend, kept it brief. Rubbish.
Brian was right, of course, and he didn't miss his lot and hit the
wall when he got them into the dressing room afterwards. But Wright is
aware what is at stake, while some his players appear to have their
minds on other matters for much of Saturday afternoon.
Clydebank are uncomfortably close to the wrong end of the
first-division, and a few more displays like that against Ayr and they
could be in serious trouble.
But perhaps Wright was just having a bad day because he didn't have a
good word to say about anybody, especially Ayr. ''I wouldn't like to pay
to watch them,'' he said. ''All they do is play for free kicks, corners,
and long throw-ins. I think, and expect, they will go down.''
No messing about there, eh? Just as well that Ayr manager Simon
Stainrod is not easily upset.
When informed of the criticism, the Englishman smiled quietly and then
said with deliberation: ''Brian Wright is entitled to his opinion, and
I'm sure he is one of the most knowledgeable, most respected people in
the game. You hear stories about people who are in line for top jobs in
the sport, and I'm sure he'll get one.'' Then back came that disarming
smile.
The after-match banter certainly was better than what 838 people had
earlier paid to watch with United perhaps unfortunate not to have taken
the three points.
The opening 45 minutes, if packaged, would have resulted in an
excellent cure for insomnia, while what followed was only made more
durable by goals from Clydebank's Jim Grady, just after the hour mark,
and, with two minutes remaining, a strike by Greg Hood which was a
little bizarre. Everyone in the Clydebank danger zone appeared to wait
for someone else to kick the ball. However, Hood cleared up the
confusion by poking the ball past Gary Matthews.
But the bizarre did not end there. As the sides trooped off,
Clydebank's Craig Thomlinson had a verbal go at a linesman, and was
shown a red card by referee Jim McGilvray. Footballers, will they ever
learn?

Dunfermline 1, St Johnstone 1
THEY were united in more ways than one. Dundee United, that is. Guido
van de Kamp and Alan Main had more than their fair share of hassle
trying to maintain their first-class goalkeeping careers at Tannadice.
Not a million miles from Tannadice on Saturday, both were the length
of the East End Park pitch from one another as Dunfermline took on St
Johnstone. And both had one of those games which are better consigned to
the ''let's forget it'' file, apart from the fact that Dunfermline went
back to the top of the first division on goal difference.
Van de Kamp, whose career of keeping goal deteriorated to washing
glasses in a Dutch bar after having fallen out with United, and then was
kick-started by Dunfermline, was having a superb game -- one point-blank
save from George O'Boyle after 56 minutes even bringing a round of
applause from Main at the other end.
A minute later, Peter Davenport also was denied by van de Kamp's
acrobatics. Then the likeable Dutchman was left looking a little silly.
Kevin Twaddle managed a fairly weak effort on goal. The ball hit Andy
Tod, and took on a vicious spin. The big keeper -- facing the bright
evening sun -- seemed to stumble, and the ball ended up in the back of
the net. Twaddle is credited with the goal, and van de Kamp with a
Guido'd miss-ill.
''The sun was in my eyes,'' he said later, ''and I lost sight of the
ball. I think it was deflected off Andy Tod and it spun past me. I
suppose it's just part of a goalie's life -- you make some good saves
then lose a bad one. I must admit I was glad to see the equaliser from
Marc Millar.''
Over to Main, whose gaffer, Paul Sturrock, praised him for the amount
of work he has put in since signing late last year. The Main problem was
clearing his lines for the first hour or so. Be it a kick-out, or
clearing from a pass-back, Main probably had the cardiac unit at the
nearest hospital on red alert, so bad were his efforts.
Describing his clearances puts a strain on the search for the correct
vocabulary. ''Absolutely shocking,'' he said. Well that's not totally
accurate, but what we are allowed to say is restricted.
There was no restriction when it came to the sayings of Paul Sturrock.
They say that the best form of defence is attack, and the Saints manager
did not swing at the press conference and hit the wall.
''We are going in the right direction. In no way do I feel that the
title race is beyond us,'' he said. ''We have four games coming up from
which I am confident we can take maximum points. It will take us back
into the frame. We meet three of the top-five teams at home in our last
five games, and our home record has been exemplary.''
And the warning was there for all to hear. ''People might write us
off,'' proclaimed Sturrock, ''but they do so at their peril.''
When a quiet surveillance of the run-in is analysed, the man may have
a point -- or as he wants, three per game.
Bert Paton, with six of his first team out through injury or
suspension, admitted: ''Under the circumstances, that was a good result
for us.''
On the further bad-news front, a crunching clash between Saints
defender Paul Cherry and Fifer Kenny Ward ended with a stretcher bearing
Ward out of the arena -- and out of the game for the remainder of the
season -- with a broken bone in his left ankle.
That was during a spell when those of a nervous disposition were
advised to go for an early Bovril. To be fair to refereee Alistair
Huett, though, he did try to let the heat cool itself by natural causes,
although it was almost ironic that, despite unpunished tough tackling,
the bookings of Saints Paul Ramsey, George O'Boyle, and Sean McAuley all
seemed to be for dissent.

SECOND DIVISION
CLYDE manager Alex Smith is all too well aware of the need to take
three points from home games, especiall against teams they are expected
to beat, and he must have breathed a huge sigh of relief when little
John Dickson slotted in his eighth goal of the season on Saturday for
the only score of the match against Brechin.
The visitors have been trying hard to pull themselves off the bottom
of the division, and at Broadwood it was clear they have tightened up in
defence. However, they posed few threats to Les Fridge in the Clyde
goal.
It took an unexpected error by City keeper Derek Balfour, who had
looked comfortable with high balls all day, to create the opportunity
six minutes from time for Clyde to grab the points. This time he spilled
a cross and Dickson was on hand 15 yards out to drill the ball home and
keep Clyde within striking distance of the main promotion contenders.
With Stenhousemuir on cup duty and their match with joint-leaders
Dumbarton off until tomorrow, there was an opportunity for Morton and
Berwick to overtake the top two. However, the Greenock men slumped to
deeat at Dumfries while Berwick struggled for a point at Stirling.
Queen of the South had not won a home match since October, but made a
promising start when Tommy Bryce shot home after only two minutes.
Morton fought hard but there were chances at both ends and it was Queens
who came closer in the closing minutes.
The result means that Queens have taken seven points off Morton this
term and if the Greenock team miss out on promotion, manager Allan
McGraw will know who to blame.
Berwick now have only two wins in their past eight matches after
Saturday's 2-2 draw at Forthbank.
Stirling were twice ahead, with Joe McLeod shooting in after 33
minutes only for one-time Albion star Willie Irvine to head in an
equaliser. In a burst of activity in the last two minutes a scoring shot
by Albion sub Ally Farquhar was immediately followe by Warren Hawke's
fifteenth goal of the season.
In a battle of two struggling teams at Meadowbank, Lee Bailey put the
home side ahead but Dave Beaton immediately headed East Fife's
equaliser. A Dougie Hope tap-in was followed by a 20-yard shot from
Beaton as the Fifers ended a six-game winless run and inflicted a
seventh defeat on Meadowbank in their past eight matches.

THIRD DIVISION
A COUPLE of hat tricks for Angus teams were the highlights on
Saturday, with midfielder Steve Tosh helping Arbroath to a fifth
straight win, by 5-2 at home to East Stirlingshire, while Sandy Ross
went back to haunt his old club, Cowdenbeath, by hitting all of Forfar's
goals in a 3-1 victory, writes Bill Sutherland.
Arbroath are unbeaten since John Brogan took over as manager and the
thought occurs that, if they keep gathering the points three at a time,
they might just become outsiders for promotion. After all, some of the
teams at the top seem to be standing still.
There were few signs early on of a 5-2 scoreline at Gayfield, as the
game was goalless until 10 minutes from half-time. Barry Scott put the
home side on their way and Tosh found time to hit two before the break.
'Shire, unbeaten in their three previous away matches, still have
promotion ambitions and they hit back through Peter Dwyer and Mike
Geraghty before the hour mark. However, Tosh completed his hat trick
late on and Tom McMillan added the fifth on the final whistle.
Ross opened on the half-hour at Central Park but just before the break
top scorer Mark Yardley levelled for Cowden. Sammy Conn was sent off for
a professional foul on Ross, who then exploited the gaps to add two more
as Forfar stretched their lead in the division to nine points over Ross
County, whose home game against Albion Rovers was postponed.
But there was no joy for the third Angus team, Montrose. They may have
games in hand over the main promotion contenders but that's not much use
in their present form. They now have won only one of their past seven
matches.
They had been unbeaten in their past eight home games but perhaps the
omens began to look bad for Montrose as early as the sixth minute, when
Colin McGlashan's penalty was saved by Caley Thistle keeper Mark
McRitchie.
The visitors eventually won through a last-minute lob by substitute
Wilson Robertson.
Hugh McCann's first game in charge of Queen's Park was a happy
occasion for the Amateurs, with the added irony that the 2-1 victory at
Hampden was at the expense of the club he used to manage, Alloa.
Steve McCormick gave Queen's an early lead and just before the break
Brian McPhee ran through from 40 yards out to shoot home. A Barry Moffat
header reduced the leeway midway in the second half.

Rangers 2, Falkirk 2
IT was Jim Jefferies who put it best. ''Laudrup is almost
unstoppable,'' said the Falkirk manager. He is, too. You may ask how a
team with an ''unstoppable'' star turn managed to end up with a draw,
but we will get to that. First things first; and Laudrup is first, of
that there can be no question.
His performance against the Brockville team was breathtaking, as
comprehensive a display of individual attacking skills as we have seen
in this country over the past decade.
''He is different from anyone else in this country,'' continued
Jefferies. ''He is very difficult to mark and you can only ask players
to do the best they can against him.''
The Danish forward himself argued strenuously that people should not
talk about ''a one-man team,'' something that alarms this unassuming,
articulate young man. He can recall only too well how Fiorentina fans
virtually expected him to win the Serie A by himself, and has no desire
to again experience that kind of pressure.
''Everybody in the team has a role to play. Mine is to create
chances,'' he said, and then, with a body swerve as smooth as the one he
uses to bewilder defenders, he dodged the question as to why so many he
laid on were missed.
Laudrup, conservatively, must have set up six clear scoring
opportunities for Rangers, not counting his penalty goal, the second
goal which came from his cross, and a sitter he missed himself.
If his tally at the end of the afternoon had read two goals, six
assists, it would not have exaggerated his contribution, but his
team-mates made poor use of the finest service in the premier division.
Gordon Durie, Ian Ferguson, John Brown et al queued up to miss the
chances presented by the Dane. It is interesting to ponder how Falkirk's
young Colin McDonald would have fared if Laudrup had been in his team.
As it was, he scored twice from two of the three chances Falkirk were
able to create. The two goals were also down to the ability of Maurice
Johnston to dig out chances from very little.
The former Rangers man had a splendid afternoon for his new club,
considering his time spent out of first-team action.
Smash-and-grab victories are inherent in the game, but this was
ridiculous. It was the kind of nonsensical result that, if Rangers did
not hold a huge lead in the championship, could induce self doubt in the
run-in. If you cannot win when you are this good, then life could get
tough when you are off form.
Fortunately for them, Rangers still appear well in command of their
fate. Jefferies got it right again when he said: ''I think they are a
different class from anybody else in the league, and I believe there is
not much between the other nine. That is why there are so many draws in
this division.''
Laudrup admitted that the missed chances were disappointing, but he
would be more worried if the team was not making openings. ''I think we
played well, and that is encouraging.''
Laudrup has scored 12 goals, two more than his previous best with
Bayern Munich, but the one he missed in the second half was a good
illustration that he is not the best finisher in the business. He had
been put clean through on Tony Parks, tried to go around him, but was
defied by a clever snatch of the ball by the keeper who, having
unearthed a Scottish grandad, did his chances of recognition by Craig
Brown no harm.
Still, it would be some kind of warped perfectionist who would
criticise the Dane for one error.
His skills finally got to young Graeme Hamilton who, for the most
part, had the unenviable task of trying to halt him. Two yellow cards,
the second of which came in the seventy-second minute after a foul on
Laudrup, meant he had to leave the action.
By then Falkirk, who had stolen a lead in the first half when McDonald
nipped in to touch home a pass from Johnston which was deflected into
his path, were still very much in the game, at least as far as the
scoreboard was concerned. They had lost that lead when Laudrup smacked
home the penalty kick just on half time after his low cross into the
middle found Ian Durrant, who was tripped by John Clark.
McDonald regained the advanatage when he knocked in a superb pass from
Johnston, but then Brown headed in Laudrup's cross for the equaliser.

Raith Rovers 1, Airdrie 4
AIRDRIE lived up to their name of cup specialists at the weekend when
they wrecked Raith Rovers' dreams of an outrageous treble, and kept
themselves on course for their second Scottish Cup final appearance in
four years.
Rovers, having already won the Coca-Cola Cup and with ambitions of the
first division title, were swept out of the quarter-finals by a
thoroughly professional and determined performance from Alex MacDonald's
men.
Raith never looked like matching that professionalism -- they
dominated only for the first five minutes then had two players sent off
in the later stages -- and afterwards, manager Jimmy Nicholl blasted the
men who were transformed from Coca-Cola Cup champs into Scottish Cup
chumps.
He confirmed that captain Shuan Dennis and Steve McAnespie, who were
red carded, would be fined, then said: ''I am so disappointed the
players didn't take heed of what I told them at half-time.
''We started well and when Shaun Dennis hit a post and John Martin had
to make a great save, I thought 'here we go. We're going to pick up
where we left off on Monday when we beat them in the league at
Broadwood.' It didn't turn out that way and we found ourselves two
behind at the break.
''In that type of situation, all you're looking for is to get back
into the game. But we let frustration get to us. I can accept the team
having off days, but I can't accept their lack of discipline in the
second half. Now we've got players facing suspensions at a vital stage
of the season.
''We have important league matches coming up and our players have made
it more difficult for themselves.
''Having said that, I say good luck to Airdrie. They did their
homework, worked hard, and played well. Alex MacDonald will now be
thinking they can go all the way, and why not?''
More than the Airdrie manager think they can go all the way. Captain
Jimmy Sandison and the oustanding Kenny Black, who both missed out when
Airdrie lost to Rangers in the 1992 final, feel the side is well
equipped. Said Black: ''There's no reason why we can't win the cup. When
we were in the premier division we gave a good account of ourselves
against the top clubs. We certainly don't fear any of the sides left in
the competition.''
Black then explained the reason for the turnaround after having lost
to Raith at their temporary home in Cumbernauld last week. ''It suits us
to play away from home,'' he said. ''There's no atmosphere at Broadwood
and we all really enjoyed playing at Stark's Park in front of a packed
house.''
Paul Harvey scored after 21 minutes when Dennis could only knock a
long throw from Jimmy Boyle straight to him 20 yards from goal. The
little midfield man shot through a packed defence past the unsighted
Scott Thomson.
The second goal, in 37 minutes, was another bleak moment for Dennis,
who before the match had been named as Raith's player of the month. This
time, he was outjumped by Steve Cooper for a Harvey cross and John
Davies stepped in to score.
Kenny Black made it three from the penalty spot after 60 minutes when
Andy Smith had been brought down by Jason Rowbotham, and Harvey grabbed
the fourth 11 minutes from time with a beautiful lob. Colin Cameron
headed a late consolation goal for the home side near the end.
RAITH Rovers will almost certainly find themselves in trouble with the
SFA after a second-half incident in which a plastic bottle was thrown
from the terracing towards stand-side linesman Doug Sommers.
The match was held up for several minutes. Worse news for Raith is
that Jim Farry, the SFA's chief executive, was watching from the main
stand.

Stenhousemuir 0, Hibernian 4
THEY squeezed themselves into Stenhousemuir's ramshackle stadium which
holds only 3500, and 10 young boys, who couldn't get their hands on
tickets, perched themselves high up in a group of trees overlooking one
end of Ochilview. The locals were beginning to believe in their team,
who had already ushered St Johnstone and Aberdeen through the Tennents
Scottish Cup exit.
Long before the end of the quarter-final tie, all but one of the
youngsters had shimmied down the tree trunks and wandered off to find
something else to do on a sunny Saturday afternoon.
There seemed to them little point in hanging around to watch
Stenhousemuir's cup quest disintegrate into the realms of fantasy when
confronted by the twin forces of a Hibernian side, determined to put in
a competent and professional day's work, and cruel misfortune.
The second division side's profile was heightened considerably by
previous cup exploits, but Stenhousemuir's progress also led to their
downfall. Hibs, when they arrived at Ochilview, were prepared and knew
that if they were careful and tight at the back, the same despair which
had swamped Stenhousemuir's previous victims would not drag them down.
The first half was fairly even, although Hibs played the ball on a
difficult, treacherous surface with better touch and direction, and
during the interval, Alex Miller told his players that if they stepped
up the pace of the match, they would leave Stenhousemuir behind. That is
precisely what happened.
Hibs scored all four of their goals in the second half in which
Michael O'Neill's running and vision were outstanding. The Northern
Ireland internationalist could not be contained by Stenhousemuir's
defenders, who were easily pulled out of position without the vastly
experienced George McGeachie to talk them through, and guide them.
The 36-year-old defender injured a foot towards the end of the first
half, and although he tried to continue, he had to hobble off after only
six more minutes, by which time Hibs were in front. Manager Terry
Christie was forced into a reshuffle, with John McNiven making up the
defensive numbers, but Stenhousemuir were never quite the same.
It was clear McGeachie was in too much distress when he was unable to
do anything to repel the attack in 50 minutes which presented Kevin
Harper with the opportunity to begin what very quickly became a rout.
O'Neill raced through the middle, and at the right time, played a pass
left to Keith Wright, whose run also was timed to perfection. The
striker reached the line before squaring the ball into the middle,
leaving 19-year-old Harper with a simple task.
The first of the tree dwellers slid down to the ground and sloped off,
hands buried in his pockets. Harper's goal was the first scored against
Stenhousemuir by an opponent in six ties -- Euan Donaldson's own goal in
a third-round match against St Johnstone was the only goal they had
conceded in the cup until Hibs arrived -- but it would not be the only
one.
Only four minutes, after having gone ahead, Hibs' Joe Tortolano
rattled the bar with a shot struck fiercely, but he would claim his
moment in 64 minutes after John Clarke had fouled O'Neill 25 yards from
goal. Tortolano took the free kick and although his shot was not the
most powerful, the ball bounced in front of Mike Harkness and looped
over his body into the net.
O'Neill, who by this time was running free and enjoying himself --
''suddenly when you are a couple of goals in front the bumps on the
pitch which had bothered you previously didn't seem to be there any
more'' -- scored the third, his thirteenth of the season, in 69 minutes
after Darren Jackson had supplied him with the pass. Before the game was
restarted, all but one of the boys on the trees had gone.
Clarke's poor clearance cannoned off Harper and he was able to run
straight towards Harkness and score the fourth and final goal after 77
minutes.
Hibs continued to attack at will, but they were unable to add to their
tally because of some erratic finishing and a few good saves by
Harkness. A post also denied Tortolano a second goal, but Hibs could
hardly be dissatisfied with their lot.
''The first goal gave us all the confidence we needed,'' O'Neill said.
''We knew they would be well organised, but it was a matter of time and
now we can look ahead to the semi-finals with a quiet confidence. When
we are moving forward at speed, we have as much quality in our play as
anyone else.''
O'Neill is probably the most dangerous player Hibs have, and they seem
to be reaping a handsome dividend from his recent period of inactivity
caused by suspension and a knee operation. ''I was out for five matches
which were all played in difficult conditions and perhaps the break has
done me some good,'' he said.
The Irishman also took time out to praise the performance of
Stenhousemuir's Donaldson, who is earmarked for better things. The
19-year-old full back has already been watched by a number of clubs, and
he may be on his way at the end of the season.
''He can tackle and has great pace,'' said manager Christie. ''In
fact, he is not unlike Rangers' David Robertson in the way he plays. You
know, at the start of this season he was only third choice full back and
yet he looked a real prospect today.''
Christie, Donaldson, and the rest of Stenhousemuir turn again to
promotion which was always their main objective with the cup no more
than a wonderful, but brief distraction. Thanks for the memories.

Partick Thistle 2, Aberdeen 2
THERE was a slightly bewildered air about Aberdeen's caretaker-manager
Roy Aitken after this crucial game at Firhill. Quite clearly, it was
beyond his understanding that his under-pressure Pittodrie side could
throw away a two-goal lead which might have propelled them a little
closer to safety in the premier division.
Afterwards he would not criticise his defence, though the back four
had a nightmare second-half. Instead, he maintained: ''I don't want to
individualise about players or even about different areas of the team.
''There are times when you have to defend further forward, when
everyone has to get together and make sure these things don't happen. It
is no use blaming just one area for your problems.''
Aitken and the Aberdeen fans who had been bussed down to Firhill at
the club's expense were celebrating at half-time. An astonishing goal
from Stephen Wright, who struck the ball into the net from just a couple
of yards inside the Partick half of the field, had given them the kind
of break they needed.
When Billy Dodds added a spectacular second before then interval
no-one could see anything other than Aberdeen holding on to their lead
and taking all three valuable points.
But as Aitken said after the match: ''We are just too inconsistent.
Last week we had a bad first half and a good second. This week it was
the other way around.
''What we have to do is put the two together. We have to show our real
form over 90 minutes. We have just eight games left and we have to start
to string results together. I would like that to start next week against
Hibs.
''We will be working hard all week getting ready for that game. There
is no doubt that this was a game we should have won.''
Predictably, Thistle manager John Lambie was not ready to agree with
that. ''We dominated the game,'' he claimed. ''We missed so many chances
in the first half and then went in two goals down. It was hard to
believe.
''Their first goal was a fluke. It would never happen again. The
tremendous thing about our lads was that they just would not give up.
''They will be the same against Motherwell when they come here in
midweek. They have to keep that going and they will. In the end we got a
point but I think we should have had all three.
''We have 10 games left and we have got to do our own thing in all of
them. That's the one way we can survive in this league.''
Full back and dead-ball expert Steve Pittman was the man mainly
responsible for the Thistle revival. He blasted in a long-range
free-kick after 52 minutes, and then had another storming shot, after
the Dons had given away another foul, helped into the net by team-mate
Tommy Turner.
If the watching Scotland manager, Craig Brown, was able to take
anything of value from the game, it came from Thistle keeper Nicky
Walker. It was his headed clearance which found Stephen Wright -- but
there is no way he could be blamed for that opening goal.
Nor could you fault him with the second. Walker looked confident,
handled well, and his kick-outs were intelligent.
He was one of the men under scrutiny for the visit to Moscow and he
looked good enough to go to Russia as deputy for Jim Leighton.
Walker's return to first-team football -- and to form -- could be a
major factor in the Thistle fight against the drop to the first
division.
The Maryhill men did deserve a point for their show of aggression, and
when Aitken takes his men in training this week that must be something
he emphasises.
Aberdeen may have more skilled players. They certainly have a team
which possesses infinitely more talent than the side put together in
swop-shop fashion by Lambie.
Where they could not compete was when the going got tough. That was
when Thistle began to scrap for every ball, bite into every tackle, and
chase every seemingly lost cause.
The question has to be asked if Aberdeen would have recovered if they
had been the team which had gone two goals behind. By now, everyone in
Scottish football knows that answer.
And it's the lack of passion, the lack of ambition, the lack of drive
which has now pushed Aberdeen to the brink of relegation. Aitken must
find a solution before it's too late.

Hearts 2, Dundee United 1
INSPIRED by two goals from a man who was freed by Blackburn Rovers
four years ago, Hearts kept up their astonishing record against United,
who have not won at Tynecastle for 10 years, and, in the process, joined
their capital rivals in the last four of the Tennents Scottish Cup.
There was nothing exceptional about their performance, although John
Millar's goals were well taken, but it was filled with the kind of
willing determination that invariably succeeds on these occasions, and
the fact that they had to come from behind to get there is ample
testament to their spirit.
United, on the other hand, were a let-down, especially after the way
they opened the tie, playing exciting, intelligent, attacking football
that threatened to leave the home team scrambling in their wake.
Yet even the finest start imaginable, a goal by the Brazilian, Sergio,
in four minutes, did not motivate them towards a victory which would
have helped fulfil their manager's promise that they would defend their
trophy at Hampden on May 27.
Now, they have to face up to a battle against relegation and, after
this disappointment, it might be difficult for Ivan Golac to lift their
morale. The defeat also may have sealed Golac's future. For Hearts, this
will be their sixth semi-final in nine years and keeps them on course to
win their first major trophy for 33 years.
They owe a lot to Millar, who was in the right place twice to head
home, first to equalise Sergio's goal and then to put his side in front.
He won the man-of-the-match award, although only just in front of
team-mate Stephen Frail.
United's response was never impressive and in the end the team that
truly wanted to win got their just reward. Having beaten Rangers in the
last round and now the holders, Hearts are entitled to harbour hopes
that this might really be their year.
Tynecastle's well-worn pitch may not have been the ideal surface for a
touch of Brazilian class but the United striker, Sergio, managed it none
the less within four minutes when he scored.
David Hannah supplied the pass but there was a lot of work to be done
by the Brazilian, who used his close control to manoeuvre between two
defenders, Millar and Dave McPherson, and his deceptive, long stride
into the penalty area took him in front of the chasing Neil Berry.
All that was left was to beat Craig Nelson, and the Brazilian did it
the impudent way, putting the ball between the keeper's legs.
For a long spell after that United, who had surprised Hearts by using
three players up front, including Christian Dailly, looked distinctly
superior to the capital side. Their interplay in midfield and the
incisiveness of Dailly and Sergio forced Hearts into changing to a
straightforward back four, and gradually that helped the Edinburgh team
plug the leaks and climb into the tie.
In 21 minutes Millar made the first of two vital interventions to
confirm his side's recovery.John Colquhoun was fouled by Billy McKinlay
on the edge of the penalty area, and when the free-kick by Frail came
across, the United defenders ambushed McPherson but left Millar, coming
in on the far post, and he neatly headed the ball home.
Sergio occasionally burst into the action with his exciting control
and strength in resisting tackles, but United's domination ended with
that goal and after Jim McInally had been booked for a foul on Frail,
Millar repeated his trick from the other side of goal.
The corner from the left, by Gary Mackay, was headed on by Willie
Jamieson and there was Millar to head the ball into the right-hand side
of the goal.
United almost snatched an equaliser before the interval when Hannah's
cut-back was touched forward by Sergio but Jamieson, who was earning his
money, cleared off the line.
Hearts looked keen to get on with it at the start of the second half
but Brian Hamilton was a bit too keen with a late tackle on Scott
Crabbe, and was promptly shown the yellow card.
A couple of minutes later Crabbe was taken off, replaced by Jerren
Nixon, and then Hearts substituted Kevin Thomas for John Colquhoun but
United were beginning to look more threatening again.
They forced Hearts back into defence and from one corner on the right,
there was a ferocious scramble before the danger was cleared.
However, Hearts substitute Thomas had the easiest of chances to settle
the tie when Gordan Petric made an appalling error when, trying to find
Maurice Malpas, he laid the ball in front of the striker who had a clear
shot at goal with only the keeper to beat but he managed to smack it
well wide of target.
Hearts then replaced David Hagen with Scott Leitch but by now it was
all about energy rather than subtlety.
With 15 minutes left United tried their last throw, with Craig
Brewster coming on for Hannah, giving them four forwards.
Thomas had to go off for treatment to a leg injury, leaving Hearts
with 10 men, both subs having been used, but he reappeared within a
minute.
Nixon was the third man to be booked near the end as his team faded
wearily out of the spotlight for another season.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Frail, Millar, Berry, Jamieson, McPherson,
Colquhoun, Hamilton, Robertson, Mackay, Hagen. Substitutes -- Thomas,
Leitch, Smith.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, McInally, Malpas, Hannah, Petric, Welsh,
Bowman, McKinlay, Sergio, Crabbe, Dailly. Substitutes -- Brewster,
Nixon, Jorgensen.
Referee -- W Crombie (Edinburgh).

<HEADLINE>Ultimate challenge for Hastings</HEADLINE>

THE ultimate challenge. The choice of words to describe Saturday's
Grand Slam showdown with England belong to the Scotland's captain, Gavin
Hastings.
For the past nine years, since he made his Scotland debut against
France, Hastings has trekked the globe, boldy going where few rugby men
have gone before. He has won with the British Lions in Australia and, as
captain, came within a questionable refereeing decision of repeating the
feat in New Zealand.
He was a crucial member of Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam side, and three
weeks ago in Paris his mission -- in the parlance of Gene Roddenberry's
Star Trek split infinitive -- was to boldly win where no Scots had won
since 1969.
Against the backdrop of such a career, for Hastings to describe the
Twickenham shoot-out as the ''ultimate challenge'' underlines with a
vengeance the magnitude of the task which faces the Scots as they seek
to win at RFU HQ for only the third time since the war.
At the weekend the Scots worked out at Murrayfield. Later, and mindful
of the psychological word-game which has already broken out in the
lead-up to the game, I asked Hastings if his side were quietly
confident.
''That's a difficult one isn't it. You can go down with bags of
confidence but that doesn't mean that you're going to win. I think I'd
just say that the English won't treat us with disdain and they'll
recognise that Scotland are capable of mounting a serious challenge.
''We recognise that this, indeed, is going to be the ultimate
challenge, and for us to win is going to require an immense effort.''
The turnaround in Scottish fortunes since the win over Canada in
January has been remarkable, miraculous even. Until then they had gone
nine games without a win and since then they have not lost.
That string of defeats represented as stern a challenge to the
Hastings character as it is possible to imagine.
Had there ever been a time when the criticism, much of it personal in
nature, seemed too much? ''I wasn't worried for me personally. I was
worried about the team.
''You just have to learn to take the knocks that this game hands out.
Last week when Wales scored after a couple of minutes, I wasn't feeling
particularly clever about the situation, but the game lasts for 80
minutes and you just have to pick yourself up and get on with it.
''The South Africans scored six tries against us last November. Every
time a try is scored against Scotland, I feel terrible. But you just
have to get back up the other end and score. It doesn't matter whether
it's a penalty goal or a try. You just have to get your confidence back
by getting that score,'' he says.
So, in the final reckoning, the difference between winning and losing
is mostly about strength of character?
''Character has a lot to do with it, yes, but, so far as my character
is concerned, that is not for me to say. My team-mates would have to
answer that. I just do the job of captaining the side as I see it. Once
you are out there on the pitch there is nobody to tell you how to do the
job. You just do what comes naturally and what you think is right in any
given situation.''
''There's been a bit of a turnaround in Scotland's fortunes, and
that's nice but it certainly hasn't been the criticism which came my way
that has kept me going. That hasn't been my driving force. If people
want to criticise me then fine, that's up to them. But I look at life
from the inside out rather than from the outside in.''
Self-belief has been the driving force in Hastings' prolonged spell at
the top of the world game. ''My motiviation has been what I have
believed in, not what the critics have said about me and I would have
known if it hadn't been right for me to have adopted that attitude,'' he
declared.

WALES will stage the 1999 Rugby World Cup final after having beaten
off the challenge mounted by Australia, but the price paid by the Welsh
RFU to secure the backing of the Northern Hemisphere unions means that,
like 1991, the competition will also be hosted by Scotland, England,
Ireland, and France, writes Derek Douglas.
Scotland has secured less than had been originally hoped, but the
upshot of the weekend decision by the International Rugby Football
Board, meeting in Bristol, is that the Scottish side will play all of
its games at Murrayfield.
Some football grounds may be pressed into service for pool matches
involving other sides in Scotland's pool, the SRU viewing the event as a
golden opportunity to market the game throughout the country.
The verdict was delivered by the International Board and Vernon Pugh,
chairman of the Welsh RU said: ''Wales one, Australia nil.''
Wales fronted a successful European bid that was preferred to a push
led by Australia that would have spread the tournament across the
Western Pacific, including Japan and New Zealand.
Pugh, who also is chairman of the International Board, said: ''It is
absolutely wonderful news. Australia are naturally disappointed but they
have taken the decision in the spirit of rugby and will be determined to
make Rugby World Cup 1999 a success.''
This will be the biggest sporting event hosted in Wales since the 1958
Commonwealth Games, when Cardiff Arms Park was the main stadium.
As the host nation, Wales will not only stage the final, but also the
third-place play-off. The Arms Park also will be the venue for a
quarter-final and all Welsh pool games.
The tournament will feature 20 nations, rather than the 16 in the
first three World Cups in 1987, 1991, and '95.
England will stage one of five pools of four teams and Twickenham will
be the setting for the two semi-finals. Scotland, Ireland, and France
will each stage a pool, a quarter-final and a quarter-final play-off
match.
Scotland had expressed a desire to stage a semi-final and SRU
International Board representative Freddie McLeod had been extremely
critical of England's demand to stage both semi-finals as the price of
their support for Wales.
The final decision falls short of Scottish and Irish expectations, but
yesterday SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said there had been a very real
danger the competition could have gone to the Southern Hemisphere for
the second time in a row -- South Africa will host this year's event --
and the Scots were delighted to be involved in 1999's event.
''We will stage pool games plus a quarter-final and a qualifying game.
The Scottish side's games will take place at Murrayfield and the other
pool games will be spread around the country. We may use club grounds
or, perhaps, football grounds. It is early days but St Johnstone's
McDiarmid Park, in Perth, may yet come into the equation,'' he said.

THERE'S one thing about Partick Thistle manager John Lambie when he's
in the dug-out. He never seems to run out of puff. Roy Aitken, of
Aberdeen, however, looks as though he should take a leaf out of the
Firhill leader's book, or even his cigar box.
The premier division relegation battle between the sides, which ended
2-2 on Saturday, showed the cigar-smoking Thistle manager at his best --
no silence of the Lambies here -- with (left to right) ashes to ashes,
must needs must, followed by smoke probably ready to come out of his
ears, and then the ''I told you so'' look to reflect on another valuable
point.
Roy Aitken merely looks. Ashen faced.

HAMPDEN in May could be the setting for the first all-Edinburgh
Scottish Cup final in 99 years.
The semi-final draw, made yesterday, cleared the way for Hearts and
Hibs, if they win, to meet in a capital clash that would guarantee a
take-over of the national stadium by the men from the east.
Neither manager Alex Miller, of Hibs, who will face Celtic, nor Tommy
McLean, of Hearts, who will take on Airdrie, was ready to discuss any
prospective final, that being the way with team leaders who recoil at
the idea of tempting fate.
''I am not interested in talking about an all-Edinburgh final,'' said
Miller. ''I just want to see us beat Celtic.''
McLean was equally reticent: ''Airdrie got a great result yesterday
and they will be difficult opponents. But there is a lot of playing to
be done before then and we will concentrate on that first.''
The Tynecastle side last met Airdrie in the Tennents Scottish Cup
semi-final in 1992, when the first division side won in a penalty
shoot-out in a replay.
Hearts' scoring hero, John Millar, who collected both goals in his
team's 2-1 win over holders Dundee United yesterday, played in that
semi-final replay and, therefore, has a healthy respect for the
Lanarkshire side.
''They will be confident.'' he said, ''and just because we have beaten
Rangers and the holders does not mean we have any right to win the
cup.''
It is probable that the Hibs-Celtic tie will be chosen by Sky TV, and
will be played either on Friday, April 7, or Monday, April 9, leaving
the Airdrie-Hearts semi-final the Saturday to themselves. The SFA will
decide the venues today but it seems odds-on that Hibs and Celtic will
go to Ibrox and the other two to Hampden.
It was the first time in his career that Millar, the former Blackburn
Rovers player, had scored two goals in one game.
His manager, who described Millar's goals as ''two great headers,''
reckoned that Hearts showed enough character to earn their victory,
especially as they were without Craig Levein and Jim Bett, both
suspended.
Dundee United manager Ivan Golac, who led his side to their first
Scottish Cup win last season, insisted he is not quitting the club now
that they are out. ''There is too much to play for. I am not giving
up,'' he said. ''People are too negative here. We are not talking about
relegation, when we are only six points behind the third team. If we
talk about not winning the battle there would be no sense in playing at
all.
''There are 27 points still to be played for. Today we lost. Tomorrow
we win.'' Golac reckons Hearts will have to be careful against Airdrie
but tips Celtic to win the cup.
In England, Manchester United are odds-on favourites to retain the FA
Cup after they landed a semi-final draw against the winners of the
Wolves-Crystal Palace replay.
Alex Ferguson's team are 8-11 to land the trophy after their 2-0
victory over Queen's Park Rangers. In the other semi-final tie,
Tottenham meet Everton, the London side reaching the round of the last
four thanks to a goal in the last minute from Jurgen Klinsmann away to
Liverpool.
But the other side of the Merseyside double act, Everton, had better
luck when Duncan Ferguson, the former Rangers striker, had a leading
part in their 1-0 success against Newcastle.
THE DRAW
SCOTLAND
Semi-finals -- Airdrie v Hearts, Hibernian v Celtic.
ENGLAND
Semi-finals -- Manchester United v Crystal Palace or Wolverhampton,
Tottenham v Everton.

<HEADLINE>Currency upset seen lifting banks' dealing profits</HEADLINE>

RECENT currency turbulence is likely to provide a welcome boost to
British banks' dealing profits this year after a frustrating 1994
performance, according to banking analysts.
Difficult market conditions last year linked to the start of an upward
trend in interest rates depressed dealing profits across the board and,
in some cases, resulted in huge losses from securities trading.
''The recurrence of currency speculation is likely to be very welcome
in trading rooms,'' said Peter Toeman, banking analyst at British broker
Hoare Govett in London. ''Dealing profits should look better in 1995 in
general since the securities side is likely to improve as well.''
The worst hit of the major banks was HSBC Holdings which suffered a
76% slump in its dealing profits to #261m after a bumper #1100m in 1993.
Some #93m were lost through trading on the bank's own accounts.
HSBC's large exposure to the slump in world bond markets in the first
half resulted in a full-year loss of #111m from securities trading
compared with a gain of #290m in 1993.
Dealing income from interest rate derivatives also nose-dived to just
#2m from #335m.
Lloyds Bank was badly burnt, making a #39m loss from securities
trading, which dragged down its overall trading profits by 68%.
Dealing profits at BZW, the investment banking unit of Barclays Bank,
slumped to #384m from #625m the previous year.
National Westminster Bank held up relatively well with an 11% drop to
#451m from #508m previously.
''Those differences show quite clearly what sort of risk profile the
banks had,'' said Nick Collier, banking analyst at US investment bank
Morgan Stanley in London.
''NatWest benefited from its lower-risk profile. HSBC was much more
exposed to risk and really crashed in the first half.''
Standard Chartered weathered the storm quite well with an overall 12%
decline in dealing profits to #208m. Its performance was helped by a
drop of just 4% in foreign exchange dealing profits, the main source of
its trading income.
The four major clearing banks suffered a sharper-than-expected drop in
foreign exchange dealing income, most markedly at BZW with a drop of 35%
to #89m.
NatWest's forex dealing profits dived 22%, while they held up
comparatively well at HSBC with a 9% drop and at Lloyds with a 10% fall.
But the magic formula for future gains looks set to be organic growth
rather than trying to reap profits by trading large positions on the
banks' own accounts.
''We want to develop our presence in the interbank market further but
we are not taking substantial strategic positions,'' Guy Heald,
treasurer of HSBC unit Midland Bank, told Reuters after the release of
the group's annual results.
Similar views were echoed by his counterparts at NatWest Markets,
Martin Owen, and David Band at BZW.
Owen was particularly encouraged by a 38% rise in customer volumes in
its treasury division last year. -- Reuter.

IN A darkened council flat in Glasgow in 1974, a nine-year-old boy
complained to his mother that he could not play with his toy soldiers
because of frequent power cuts. By candlelight, his mother explained
patiently that the lights had gone out because men working under the
ground to produce the fuel for electricity were on strike. They had a
hard life and deserved sympathy rather than indignation, she told him.
It was the child's first political lesson, and it left a vivid
impression. Other lessons followed -- from schoolteachers who told him
about apartheid in South Africa and the civil rights movement in
America, from university students who introduced him to Marxist
theories, and from striking print union workers who welcomed him on
their picket lines. The young man watched, listened, and learned with an
intensity that impressed his new-found friends in the militant socialist
movement.
Twenty years after putting away his toy soldiers Tommy Sheridan is
leading his own shock troops in political battles to destroy what he
perceives as an iniquitous social and economic system. The youth who was
inspired by visions of revolution has become the man determined to make
a bonfire of the vanities and injustices of the class system he abhors.
Wherever there are brickbats to be hurled at the Establishment, the
31-year-old convener of Scottish Militant Labour is there. Throughout
the poll tax revolt, Sheridan was in the thick of the action; when water
privatisation became an issue, Sheridan was on the streets orchestrating
militant opposition; when children flocked to the M77 protest camp,
Sheridan was there in muddy boots to welcome them.
To his constituents in the Pollok housing scheme on Glasgow's South
Side, Sheridan is a local hero; a working-class David defying an army of
political and corporate Goliaths. To his foes he is a reckless
rabble-rouser fanning the flames of popular discontent for destructive
political ends. There is, as for most controversial figures, an element
of truth in both views.
Yet despite his high profile he remains an enigma to most observers.
What makes Tommy tick? The answer, in his own words, is relatively
simple: ''My whole lifeblood, every instinct in my body, is for unity of
working-class people. I am striving to eradicate a repressive class
system and create a more egalitarian society.'' That is the leitmotiv of
the Sheridan roadshow as it pitches its tents on the radical fringes of
mainstream politics in the hope of attracting more customers.
His council flat in Pollok is little more than a changing room for the
militant left's star performer as he rushes from one act of
confrontation to the next. But visitors are left in no doubt as to who
are the ringmasters. From above the gas fire a portrait of Lenin gazes
sternly towards a large framed poster of John Maclean, the original Red
Clydesider; Keir Hardie shares a wall with Trotsky, and the bookcase is
crammed with Marxist theories.
A passion for football has its place on the windowsill with a
collection of small trophies; thus an avuncular Trotsky peers down at a
silver cup inscribed: Pollok Community Cup Winners. A photograph of
Sheridan's sisters and another of a long-standing girlfriend are the
only indications that life exists for him outside politics and football.
In his absence, an answering machine informs callers that he is
''probably out fighting the Tories''. The message concludes: ''Remember,
don't let the Tories and their rotten system get ye down. Let's stand up
together an' fight for change and socialism.''
Sheridan is much in demand. When we arrive at his flat there are nine
messages waiting for him. The first is from ''Coco'' warning of trouble
at an M77 protest site; a community worker is asking about supplies of
stew for sheltered housing; and Radio Scotland is looking for an
interview. A friend who answers a call when we enter fosters a furtive
atmosphere by saying: ''I don't want to speak on the phone mate, you
know what his phone's like.''
Whatever else he is, Sheridan is not secretive about his ambitions and
strategies. He comes across as a personable and disarmingly candid young
man with a fierce commitment to an ideal, tempered by the admission that
he still has much to learn. Whatever one may think of his political
views, there is no doubting the sincerity with which he holds them.
It could have been very different. Had it not been for his mother
Alice, a former trade union official and now a fellow Militant Labour
councillor, he could have been competing on another field. When he left
school at 17, there was talk of trials with professional football clubs,
but his mother persuaded him to further his education with a powerful
argument. It was the duty of working people, she told him, to gain
education to fight for their class. He packed his bags for Stirling
University with her mantra in mind: ''Give me knowledge, give me
power.''
Stirling was a revelation. Sheridan recalls being shocked in one of
his first sociology tutorials when a student asked what the dole was. It
was a salutary lesson in the gap of ignorance between rich and poor.
More important, Sheridan found an immediate affinity with militant
members of the university Labour Club then campaigning on behalf of Tony
Benn for the deputy leadership of the party. In Marx and the militant
left faction he found the guide and the political home he had been
looking for.
''The more I read of Marx on the course and the more I discussed the
practical application of Marxism, the more convinced I became that it
was a philosophy which was an excellent guide to life and offered an
explanation of society which had been lacking.''
But Sheridan was impatient. It was ''all very well sitting around in
Aran-knit jumpers in ivory towers discussing what's wrong with the world
and how to change it'', but he was eager for action. His favourite
metaphor of football comes into play: ''It's one thing talking on the
sidelines, but it's another proving what you can do on the pitch.''
His first foray was in 1983, organising student groups to support
Sogat workers in dispute with Eddie Shah at the Stockport Messenger. ''I
remember comparing it with the steel strike a couple of years before,
when there was just a bit of pushing and shoving between bobbies and the
picket line. Now all of a sudden you had a paramilitary force of riot
police on the streets. Here, in front of your eyes, was the class
struggle.''
After graduating from Stirling with a 2:1 honours degree in politics
and economics, Sheridan devoted his energies to building a militant
faction within the Labour Party and to pulling the movement in a radical
direction. It was an apprenticeship in the cut and thrust of party
politics that served him well when he was eventually expelled from the
party and Scottish Militant Labour emerged from semi-clandestinity to
contest municipal elections.
His turbulent career since then may be summed up by the title of his
book, published last year: A Time to Rage. Sheridan readily admits that
he has used controversial issues -- from the poll tax to VAT on fuel,
and the M77 to the Criminal Justice Act -- to galvanise support for his
party and its goals. It is a common political tactic, and he makes no
apology for using it.
''In every campaign we're involved in, socialist change is what we're
after. That's the big idea, that's what we're grasping for. But
revolution isn't just one big act, it consists of hundreds and thousands
of smaller actions in which you're always trying to raise the issues of
justice and inequality. Far too often people will blame this or that on
an individual politician or a party. I think the most important thing is
to try to promote an awareness that it's the social and economic system
itself that's to blame, and that we need a radical transformation of the
whole system.''
Thus blocking the construction of a motorway, occupying a luxury flat
to highlight the misery of the homeless, and protesting against council
cuts are all regarded as legitimate platforms for preaching
revolutionary socialism.
Sheridan shrugs aside taunts about the failure of communism in the
former Soviet Union, insisting that it was inevitable given the backward
agrarian economy of the country and the lack of co-operation and support
from the developed European nations. ''The beauty of Trotsky is that he
not only built and led a revolution, he lived long enough to be able to
analyse what went wrong. His exposition of the material necessity for
socialism to be built in the first place and what went wrong in Russia
is the most valuable set of ideas that he gave us.''
This, in a rough Glasgow accent, before a gas fire in a council flat
with the image of John Maclean looking down approvingly. A comparison
between the Red Clydesider and the earnest young man expounding Marxist
doctrines is inevitable, but Sheridan says: ''I've still got a lot to
learn. I'm on the coat-tails of Maclean rather than in his boots.''
He professes no particular personal ambitions. He would like to be
part of a socialist government, possibly in charge of transport, but
reverts to the sporting metaphor to explain his preferred role: ''No'
everybody can score the goals, and strikers are no use without men at
the back. The midfield is the powerhouse of the team, creating chances
for the forwards and stopping the other team breaking through. I think
that's where I belong.''
Sheridan ''disnae care a toss'' for critics who brand him the ''Pied
Piper of Pollok'' and a ''sleekit socialist'' preaching simplistic and
utilitarian Marxism. He laughed when Tory councillor John Young vowed he
would throw his civic chains into the Clyde rather than see Sheridan
wearing them as leader of the opposition in the city council. He cares
very much, however, how he is perceived in the streets and up the closes
of his working-class constituency.
''One guy once accused me of being a legend in my own mirror. I'm very
conscious about the vanity of the whole thing, and about what the
working class think. If they saw me as some kind of chameleon out for
self-aggrandisement, I would worry that I was being misunderstood, I was
not getting our message across.''
So what is the message? ''I want a social and economic system where
the means of production are collectively owned and controlled, where
need is the driving force of economics and not profit. We're no' talkin'
about the local fish and chip shop or the newsagent round the corner,
we're talkin' about the conglomerates that decide what happens in our
lives. What we should have is a ceiling and a floor, and within that
make sure nobody falls below the floor or rises above the ceiling.''
It is a vision of a socialist paradise that has existed for centuries,
but Sheridan seems unaffected by the manifest failure of repeated
attempts to realise it. ''I think it's inconceivable for us to argue we
can't do it. Some might say I'm looking for some kind of Utopia. I would
reply 'yes, why the hell not?' ''
Sheridan is a clean-cut revolutionary. He does not smoke and he
considers alcohol a scourge of society in terms of broken homes and
violence against women. Gambling, he says, is just a nonsense. Outside
his ''midfield role'' in politics and an amateur football team, he has
little time for other interests and none for raising a family of his
own. ''I'm married to revolution,'' he declares. ''Some of my friends
have nice houses, families, and well-paid jobs, but they're unhappy. I
think tae myself I've no' got much money, I'm no' married, and I don't
have a family, but I'm happy with what I'm doing. I can sleep at night
because I know that I've tried in whatever small way to change things
for the better. I think that's worth while.''
All of which is deeply satisfying to Alice Sheridan. ''I've always
brought my children up to challenge injustice, regardless of the cost to
themselves, because you have to live with yourself,'' she says. In her
view, there was always ''something special'' about her son; the child
who cried when an elderly neighbour was mugged had become a man of
integrity, moral courage, and emotional honesty.
Another relative considers he would have made a good priest. One
suspects that even then he would have been a radical, asking God why He
was not on a picket line on His day off.
Others take a less favourable view of the Pollok rebel. He is
variously dismissed as a heidbanger, a naive and hopeless dreamer, and
reviled as a nasty trouble-maker intent on destroying a fairly decent
society rather than improving it. Militant Labour is in decline, his
critics say, and will be wiped out in next month's council elections.
Sheridan pays no heed. For him it is still a time to rage, and whether
he does so from Glasgow's City Chambers or from a windy street corner in
Pollok is all the same to him. Tommy Sheridan is ready to build a
bonfire of class vanities anywhere.
SHERIDAN deeply mistrusts the media, but he is a reliable source of
quick-fire quotes and snappy headlines such as ''Tommy Guns down the
Tories''.
His quotable comments include:
On overseas housing trips by Labour councillors:
Maybe we should have log cabins in Drumchapel or wigwams in
Easterhouse.
On water privatisation:
We are confident that the Scottish people will sink the Tory water
boards.
On a trade unionist joining the board of an investment trust:
The majority of trade union leaders nowadays are more like bosses than
workers anyway.
On police tactics:
The police, more often than not, are deployed as a political rather
than a social force. While they remain outwith the control of the
community they will fail to secure the support and co-operation of the
community.
On plans to restore Tait's Tower in Bellahouston Park:
This is yet another waste of money, unless the tower is intended to
hold all of those councillors who have made promises to their
constituents and broken them.
On reports of the impending demise of Scottish Militant Labour:
We will continue to push forward. Rumours of our death have been
greatly exaggerated.

Christopher Portway is enchanted by the magic of a Hebridean island
THERE'S two things to enjoy about Mull -- the island itself and the
process of getting there. By rail or road, the journey will lead you
through some of the most astoundingly beautiful scenery in Britain.
Those abandoning the car can relax and enjoy the scenery -- the
stretch of line between Crianlarich junction and Oban is especially
evocative. Beyond Dalmally, you can see the ruins of Kilchurn Castle,
ancient stronghold of the Clan Campbell, before the line sweeps around
the head of Loch Awe to enter the famed Pass of Bender and on into Oban,
the resort almost landlocked within its picturesque bay.
Mull means ''mass of hill'', an apt description for this volcanic
225,000-acre island, the third largest in the Hebrides. Its scenery
varies from the high peaks of the south and east (with Ben More the
highest at 3169ft) to glens, rough moorland and some of the most
sensational beaches on the entire west coast.
Strictly speaking, Mull is an island group consisting of one large
island and a number of smaller ones. Mull itself suffers -- though some
might say it is blessed -- from the fact that a sizable proportion of
its visitors are transitory, many rushing to Iona, the most famous of
the smaller islands, famed throughout the world as the island home of
the celtic church. Another popular destination is Staffa, the geological
treasure which is home to Fingal's Cave.
In Hebridean stakes, Mull is claimed to be the wettest island of them
all; quite an achievement when you come to investigate the rain density
of the others. But such rainfall only enhances the soft emerald
colouring which has inspired so many artists and photographers.
But wet or fine there's plenty to do on Mull, which is less than 40
miles from end to end. The new Caledonian MacBrayne car ferry regularly
sails between Oban and Craignure, where you can choose to drive on the
good (if narrow) roads, or board Mull Rail, the island's miniature
railway to get you to a couple of the chief attractions within minutes.
There's Duart Castle which stands on a dark headland, threatening and
dour as all castles should be, its cannons covering the narrow neck of
Loch Linnhe. Duart was the ancestral home of the MacLeans from 1250
until it was overrun and put to fire in 1691 -- it was only returned to
MacLean hands in 1912. The hereditary chief and his family live there
during the summer months and it's more than likely you'll be offered a
conducted tour around the newly restored interior.
For nature lovers, the dramatic shores of Loch Scridain, the domain of
otters and seals, are a must. Overhead the skies are home to buzzards
and eagles.
On the way to the ferry terminal for Iona, you'll pass through the
village of Bunessan, but spare some time to look in on Alan Greenhalgh,
creator of the ''Mull Rivetter'' vermouth and a brew he once hoped would
take the place of whisky.
Rain or shine, Mull has much to offer; the sunshine is simply a bonus.

Sheila Waddell finds there's more to Brazil than meets the eye
COMING in to land at Garulhos Airport in Sao Paulo, you could be
forgiven for thinking you were arriving in New York. High-rise
buildings, TV masts and satellite dishes are everywhere. This is the
commercial heart of one of the world's largest economies.
Downtown Avenida Paulista, home to the banking centre, is a sea of
magnificent glass-fronted edifices demonstrating Brazil's desire to be
the power of the twenty-first century. Yet like most South American
cities, Sao Paulo offers a grim contrast between rich and poor:
showpiece marble shopping centres and luxury apartment blocks are no
more than a stone's throw away from the corrugated iron shacks of the
poor.
Less than 40 miles away, the town of Embu offers a different side of
the Brazilian coin. Here cobbled streets are lined with red-tiled
colonial buildings and tall palm trees. Art galleries have tasteful oil
paintings of the Brazilian countryside on show, while a bronze Candomble
goddess is worshipped at one of the main gallery/restaurants.
Candomble is a strange mixture of African witchcraft and Christianity.
Adherents light candles and present money to the goddess Imanja in the
hope of riches and a better life. Further north in Rio and Bahia the
beaches are crowded at night with candlelit worshippers sending small
boats full of offerings to Imanja.
Rio de Janeiro itself is best treated with extreme caution. Guanabara
Bay may be stunningly beautiful but the waters round Copacabana beach
are polluted while Ipanema has dangerous undercurrents. Soaring crime
means that tourists have to keep a constant watch on any cameras, bags
and all possessions.
If you fly or drive further north to the state of Espiritu Santo, it
is still possible to find the unspoilt Brazil of the 1950s. Vitoria, the
capital, has a skyline and a bay second only to Rio, while seaside towns
like Guarapari and Meaipe offer golden sands, friendly people and waving
palms.
Like several of the smaller coastal resorts, Meaipe has only one
hotel, the Gaeta. The locals are fishermen and refuse to have the dirt
road paved, fearful of a tourist explosion. Here restaurant staff will
happily bring caiparisimas -- cocktails made from rum and fresh lime --
to the beach along with succulent fried prawns and any other drink or
snack you fancy. Canoes glide up and down the seafront, but noisy sea
bikes and loud music are banned. This is a family resort and the locals
want to keep it that way.
Paulistas, the inhabitants of Sao Paulo, often dismiss Espiritu Santo
as a backward state only worth visiting if you have rheumatism, because
of the special qualities of the sand. Ironically, Padre Anchieta, the
founder of Sao Paulo, ended his days here in a tiny white-walled church
in a small town named after him. Anchieta, too, has a peaceful air
although a paved road leads along the coast.
Dining out in Vitoria is a must. With fabulous views of both sides of
the city, one of the hotels is a national training school for chefs and
waiting staff, all of whom take great pride in serving five star cuisine
at two star prices.
Eating out at a churrascaria is another uniquely Brazilian experience.
These are restaurants with fixed-price menus where you eat as much as
you want. The tables are set with manioc, potato and salad dishes, while
waiters come round with succulent cuts of roast beef, pork, chicken and
ham on giant skewers. There's helping after helping on offer from
friendly waiting staff, and eventually you'll be tempted to eat more
than your fill, but try convincing them you just can't eat any more.
If you travel from Rio to Sao Paulo you should not miss the coastal
road, one of the most spectacular in Brazil. On the way you will pass
Angra dos Reis, popular with the jet set, and smaller towns like
Ubatuba. The sea is turquoise blue and a chain of small islands is
strung along the coast. The colonial town of Para Ti is preserved as
part of Brazil's heritage and is home to one of the country's leading
artists -- a Scot who swapped the cold, wet Borders for the sunshine and
warmth of Brazil.
Surprisingly few Europeans travel beyond Sao Paulo to southern Brazil,
yet this is where some of the best beaches lie. Resorts like Camboriu
and Slorianopolis in the state of Santa Caterina are popular with
Argentine visitors, many of whom rent holiday homes in January and
February. However, the mild climate means that you can swim and surf at
magnificent beaches such as Joaquina in the winter months of July and
August.
Like Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, Santa Caterina
was largely settled by Germans and has a large number of fazendas
(Brazilian estancias).
In the 1820s Germans had settled in Lajes, and in 1848 Dr Blumenau led
a group of them inland to establish a new settlement. Named Blumenau,
after him, this spotlessly clean town with its elegant Bavarian
buildings and neat window boxes would not look out of place in the Black
Forest.
Information: Journey Latin America (0181 747 8315) offer return
flights to Brazil from #500 and can arrange onward transfers,
accommodation and a Brazil Airpass.

Horticulture Group, SAC, Auchincruive
A COMMON problem in the post-industrial city is large areas of now
derelict land waiting to be put to some more productive use.
Glasgow, for example, has huge areas of land that once supported some
form of heavy or manufacturing industry.
One of the factors that slows down the re-use of this land is the
problem of soil contamination. In many cases these sites have been
subjected to an unpleasant and sometimes highly-toxic mix of organic
compounds and various heavy metals as a byproduct of industrial
processes.
While many of the organic compounds eventually break down into less
harmful substances, heavy metals such as nickel, lead and cadmium
essentially persist for ever. In Glasgow alone there are over 8000
hectares of land that have been identified as suffering from some form
of industrial contamination.
Most of the established technologies for removing these substances or
rendering them acceptable often involve either chemical, microbiological
or engineering treatments. The difficulty with these techniques is that
they are extremely costly. A typical cost of cleaning up contaminated
sites is in the region of #300,000 per hectare. These huge costs mean
that the contaminated sites simply sit as they are for years, as neither
government agencies nor would-be developers have the funds to pay for
the clean-up process.
Research is currently under way in the Horticulture Department of the
Scottish Agricultural College to assess the capacity of common grass and
broadleaved weeds to absorb and retain heavy metals from contaminated
soils. This process is known as hyperaccumulation and has been observed
in a number of plant species around the world.
If we can find vigorous forms of plants that hyperaccumulate and can
be grown on contaminated sites it may be possible to achieve some
worthwhile reductions of heavy metals in the top 500mm of the soil.
Hyperaccumulating weeds would be sown over the contaminated area then
harvested with hay bailing type machinery. The cut foliage would be
removed from the site and processed to remove the heavy metals present.
Perennial species that can be harvested a number of times without
re-sowing would be most attractive.
However, in practice this may not be possible. Some of the metals
involved, for example nickel, are expensive and may actually generate a
worthwhile economic return when large areas of derelict land are
involved.
Prior to engaging on field trials, we are currently looking at
hyperaccumulation in pot trials in a glasshouse to see which plants will
grow in these soil types, which metals they accummulate, and how much.
We are particularly interested in evaluating plants found colonising
soils contaminated with heavy metals in Britain and other parts of the
world.
Time will tell whether it is possible to achieve worthwhile reductions
in contamination via this essential low-technology, low-cost approach.
If it works, the technique will be a valuable addition to current
methods of cleaning up contaminated industrial land.

Visual Arts Clare Henry reports on the MacRobert centre's ambition to
get back on to the exhibition circuit
THE FIRST exhibition I ever saw at Stirling's MacRobert Arts Centre
was a superb, star-studded, spine-tingling display of top-notch
surrealism: Magritte with his flying French loaves, Max Ernst, Dali, Man
Ray et al. Surrealist expert Roland Penrose came to talk about the
pictures and his friendship with the artists. Twenty years later it
remains one of the best shows I've seen.
It seems that MacRobert art exhibitions have gone downhill ever since,
with local crafts and amateur shows and very little to interest a wider
public. New centre director Liz Moran doesn't deny this, but aims to
beef up the exhibition programme as part of her general shake-up.
She says: ''I have overall grants of #310,000 for the complex which
comes from the four local authorities, Stirling University and the
Scottish Arts Council. That has to cover everything from theatre and
film to dance, music and art. Sponsorship and box office revenue is
additional. I come from a performing arts background and we have no
visual arts specialist, but I hope to make more of the gallery space.''
She also plans to show the Scottish Sculpture Open in the grounds in
September and is offering the studio theatre to two artists from the SSA
in 1996.
Meanwhile, Valerie Fairweather -- not part of the MacRobert but a
member of the library staff with responsibility for Stirling
University's art collection -- has mounted a loan exhibition oddly
titled After The Colourists -- The Edinburgh School.
''Colourists'' is a misleading crowd-puller, as the show consists
entirely of Edinburgh School pictures by Gillies, Redpath, MacTaggart,
Maxwell and Philipson. All were closely associated with Edinburgh
College of Art between 1945 and 1980, Gillies being head of school, then
principal, for 40 years. He met MacTaggart as a student, they shared a
studio from 1932 and remained lifelong friends, even taking painting
holidays together. Both worked flat out, Gillies painting every day.
''What else is there to do?'' he would ask.
All five shared a love of lush, succulent paint and intense, rich (if
sombre) decorative colour -- known rather pretentiously as belle
peinture. In other words, they enjoyed the physical properties of oil
paint. Their influences came from France, then from internationalists
Munch and Klee who showed with the Society of Scottish Artists in 1931
and 1934.
The SSA played a crucial role in introducing foreign artists,
including Braque, Soutine and Ernst. In Munch, Sir William MacTaggart
found a model for his magnificent atmospheric, mysterious and moody
landscapes. Later he gained inspiration from Rouault and painted flower
studies in sumptuous impasto of sulphurous yellow, glowing emerald and
petrol blue. These hedonistic pictures revel in pigment, which depicts
sun, sea, full-blown flowers and delicious fruit.
John Maxwell also loved flowers but, taking his cue from Chagall and
Odilon Redon, indulged a poetic streak to evoke an ideal fantasy world
where flowers were paired with birds, nudes and romantic figures. These
gentle dreamy pictures lacked MacTaggart's gritty energy or Redpath's
pioneering perspectives and culinary textures.
Anne Redpath was more openly influenced by the Scottish Colourists and
while her paint technique, with its pallette knife and impasto, is
nearer MacTaggart's, her still-life subjects with their magpie array of
objects and tilted table tops are her own.
Some of the most attractive pictures here are Redpath's: White Tulips
and Winter Bouquet. Her Altar in The Church of Madre Deus links her to
Sir Robin Philipson, the youngest of the five. Philipson is best known
for his cock fights, odalisques, church interiors and rose windows, one
of the most memorable (on loan from Milngavie's Lillie Gallery), being
the brilliant burst of golden light in Iconostasis. He rarely ventured
into pure abstraction but when he did, as here in Martyr, it works
extremely well.
With the exception of Gillies -- a mild, congenial uncomplicated
artist whose acutely observed linear Lowland landscapes are so popular
-- they favour dark, muted tonalities, which if closely hung, as they
are here, can be a bit overpowering. Thick oil paint can look good
enough to eat, or, conversely, sludgy and muddy. Of the 35 paintings
here (all but four loaned from Edinburgh, Dundee, Kirkcaldy and Scottish
Amicable) too many are just murky; too few memorable. Perhaps museums
have not wanted to loan their best pictures?
I wish, too, that there was more information on individual pictures,
including dates. Visitors, even university staff and students, need
easy, user-friendly documentation, preferably on the walls. Not too
much; not too little. Somehow the MacRobert has to climb back into the
Scottish exhibition circuit and make its gallery into the exciting and
significant venue it was in the early days.
The exhibition, sponsored by Flemings, continues until March 25.

<HEADLINE>Top of the brocolli table. Growers' co-op claims to be Europe's largest producer</HEADLINE>

IGNORANCE can be a wonderful thing, if you have the leisure to marvel
at its depth.
Until recently I would not have liked to say where Scotland ranked in
the brocolli production league table.
National Farmers' Union of Scotland field vegetables convener Charles
Russell came out with it at a conference in Fife. The East of Scotland
Growers' Co-operative, whose membership stretches from Berwick-on-Tweed
to Montrose, now claims to be the largest brocolli producer in Europe.
They have begun to develop an export market to Belgium and Germany and
are sole suppliers to two of the largest packers of frozen food in the
United Kingdom.
Admittedly the fresh brocolli you buy in the shops these days will
probably come from Spain. Their season finishes at the end of May and
our crop slots in nicely after that.
Brocolli, you see, requires a long, cool growing season and our
climate fits the bill ideally with long daylight hours and slow growth
which makes for larger heads.
Some of the crop is sold fresh and the balance goes for freezing at
plants both north and south of the Border.
So, brocolli, which I don't recall ever seeing in the kitchen as a
boy, is a Scottish dish now. Mr Russell is an enthusiast -- along with
the other 66 members of the growers' co-operative. ''It should be
properly cooked, very lightly boiled and not stewed,'' he warns. ''It
will then turn out a nice dark green colour on the plate.''
It certainly falls into the category of a cash crop, helping to
achieve a turn-over of about #6m for the co-op.
Gin was my second area of ignorance. I would not claim a lack of
familiarity with the product but I used to have feelings of guilt
because my palate had developed in such a way that I preferred gin to
whisky -- if forced at any time to make a choice.
My conscience is no longer troubled. Alan Macdonald, cereals
purchasing manager for United Distillers, provided the salve with a
throwaway line at a conference in Edinburgh when he pointed out that it
is from Fife-grown grain that the neutral spirit for Gordons Gin is
derived.
''All of the neutral spirit for Gordons Gin -- an international brand
leader -- is made in Fife,'' he said. What a relief to a
conscience-stricken mind.
According to Mr Macdonald, 50% of the barley and wheat grown in
Scotland ends up in a glass. United Distillers annually buys more than
450,000 tonnes, valued at about #55m, for its Scottish-based production
units.
It is not surprising that, as a major buyer, he supports the Scottish
Quality Farm Assured Cereals Scheme.
The livestock equivalent still seems to be toiling, however, as was
illustrated when a number of meat wholesalers came together in Edinburgh
to pitch for business supplying the kitchens of the Edinburgh
International Conference Centre.
The Farm Assured Scottish Livestock Scheme was not foremost in the
minds of the wholesale butchers and meat processors. Most placed more
importance on their own quality control systems than on the FASL label.
There was one school of thought that while customers might talk a lot
about quality what they were really interested in at the end of the day
was price.
If that is the case -- and if farmers continue to show some resistance
to paying money to join the FASL scheme -- it could be a very hard sell
indeed for the scheme chairman Maitland Mackie. He was expounding the
hope at the NFUS annual meeting in Aberdeen that up to 90% of livestock
farmers could be signed up in what would become a ''whole industry
scheme unique in the world''.
That ideal must be some way off.

ANOTHER New Moves goody, this time from Spain -- a double bill by
Lanonima Imperial. So much goes on in these pieces, so many detailed
moments occurring simultaneously, that it's not possible to watch
everything with equal concentration.
Yet the awareness of half-glimpsed, over-lapping imagery leaves one
feeling that a handful of dancers have brought a whole world of
experience into view with Los Gestos del Camino (Movements long The
Way), this world could be anywhere or any time.
The group who travel from one patch of sudden light to another, could
be refugees or explorers, strolling players even -- in the right place
by design, or the wrong spot by chance. At any rate, they are determined
to keep going.
There are sequences of stunning, lyrical beauty and passages of
bizarre humour -- one of the men rubber-legging into near collapse and
hauling himself back up . . . meanwhile another guy is seen prowling
around, muttering and shrugging in exasperation. And the dance flows on,
through moods of tension and exuberance -- until a final, rickety
curtain lends a sly air of theatricality, and a reminder that the piece
evolved from a performance where the set didn't arrive in time and the
dancers had to go on without it.
Eco de Silencio set to Gorecki's Third Symphony, again points up
choreographer Juan Carlos Garcia's flair for evoking situations and
emotions through cameos of movement and the juxtaposition of those
cameos.
Two men, two women, pinpointed by four overhead lights, offer images
of fear, aggression, tenderness and support with no discernible logic to
the shifts, only a gut feeling that this is how people react when
confronted with something -- like civil war -- they can't understand or
control.
Understanding and control, however, are a visible hallmark of Garcia's
dancers who combine stunning technique with an artistry that is truly
poetic, passionate and affecting.

Fifty people protested at yesterday's opening of the first McDonalds
restaurant in France's traditionalist Basque region, preferring to feast
on regional food in a snub to the ''Big Mac.'' On Monday local chefs in
the southwestern region introduced the ''Big Benat'' -- a fast-food
style sandwich made of regional products.

LIFE here isn't dull. Last Friday we were witnesses to our first
shooting, not including the time the Red Rooster was winged by a pellet
from a 12-bore.
We were going to see our travel agent in downtown Nairobi. With the
Breadwinner having pulled a calf muscle while running for a bus a few
days before so that even I can now keep up with her, we were two very
slow-moving objects indeed.
Suddenly there was very loud bang. We weren't at all startled until we
saw that people round us were bending down behind cars and that two
serious-looking gentlemen were assisting a ragged-looking youth to the
ground.
It was no more than 30 yards away so I suppose the spirit of
scientific inquiry should have propelled us along the road to see
exactly what had happened. Instead we turned smartly into the safety of
the travel agent's door.
The last we saw was the two serious-looking gentlemen, who turned out
to be plain clothes policemen, helping the youth to his feet and leading
him off.
Inside we were met by one of the most impressive sights Africa has to
offer. A cascade of secretaries with eyes shining, as only African eyes
can shine, was tumbling down the stairs to see the action. They had all
the intimidating eagerness of the fourth form at St Trinians arriving at
the dance with the boys of the local grammar school.
Our urbane travel agent had the story. A thief had been shot by the
police along with a bystander. There had, in fact, been three shots and
it wasn't at all like it is on the telly.
Since I was boy I have had a romantic vision of having sundowners on
Lake Victoria among the beautiful people. For that we really needed to
get to Uganda and then to get on the ferries that ply Africa's biggest
lake. And lo and behold, the overnight train to Uganda has started to
run again and so has the boat from Kampala to Mwanza in Tanzania.
Our travel agent was extremely doubtful about two ageing Scots making
such a safari but when I reminded him about David Livingstone he booked
us the tickets.
And so it was that at ten o'clock one morning we slipped out of
Nairobi on our scheduled 18-hour trip to Kampala, once ''the pearl of
Africa''. Idi Amin returned it to the jungle in his years of barbarism
but it is now at last re-emerging into the light.
Winston Churchill described a trip on the East African Railway as
being like Jack climbing the beanstalk. Starting at the Port of Mombassa
you climb up to the centre of the continent and find heaven in Kampala.
You have climbed 5000 feet by the time you reach Nairobi. Then it is a
stiff climb for a couple of hours through the mass of tiny fertile farms
where from as little as an acre, a woman can grow food to send her
husband and a stream of children to Nairobi in search of cash
employment.
At the top of the escarpment and at over 8000 feet, you are chugging
through the real white Highlands. Coffee and tea estates put there by
men with peeling noses who arrived in Africa, said ''this land of mine''
and made it so. No wonder the blacks have pinched it back, for anything
will grow here.
Then the line plunges down 3000 feet or so to the floor of the Rift
Valley. These are the traditional lands of the Masai herdsmen. As few as
10 years ago the tribesmen roamed free here, little puffs of dust
marking where each herd was. But now it is all entitled and most is
fenced. They are beginning to grow maize and even wheat.
It takes half-an-hour to pass the slab of Masai land that Lord
Delamere (one of the original peeling noses) marked out for himself and
a bit less to pass the chunk taken by Kenya's first president, Jomo
Kenyatta.
Then you start to climb up the other side of the valley. Here is sheep
and cattle ranching as well as the small peasant farms growing their
subsistence crops based on maize. As Africa claims its 11 hours of
darkness we are in the forests at 9000 feet at the top of the Western
escarpment of the Rift Valley.
We have a bunk each in a cabin to ourselves. The electricity doesn't
work so there are no fans, the water is off and it is filthy. But this
is first class. We complain to the very nice guard who says he has been
expecting to hear from us. He moves us to second class. That is clean.
We now have four bunks to choose between, running water and light though
the fans don't work here either.
Dinner is taken in style reminiscent of the days of the Raj.
No hamburgers here. It is silver service in the dining room with three
courses and coffee. Wine is #15 a bottle so we made do with the
excellent beer at less than a #1 a pint.
The company was jolly, too. There was a party going up to Kampala for
the 60th anniversary of the Lake Victoria sailing club and the star
among those was the broadcaster Charles Harrison who has reported for
the BBC from East Africa since he arrived here in 1954.
The beds must have been comfortable. When we got to the Ugandan border
the customs people couldn't waken us so they just let us lie. They would
not have been so accommodating in Idi Amin's time.
I'll tell you next week how the two slow-moving objects got on in
Kampala and about the quest for sundowners on Lake Victoria.

IT'S a busy week again for corporate announcements with stock market
attention likely to focus tomorrow on Kingfisher and Cordiant, the old
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, when they announce their results. Both companies have
had turbulent boardroom changes.
Kingfisher, the retail chain whose trading formats include B&amp;Q,
Superdrug and Woolworths, will be badly affected by restructuring
provisions.
Brokers UBS believe that provisions of up to #150m will send 1994
profits spiralling down to #150m compared with #309m in 1993.
The City will be keen to hear how chief executive Geoffrey Mulcahy
intends to revive the fortunes of the group. Possibly through the
disposal of the Comet electrical chain? Recently, Kingfisher announced
the departure of four former board directors, including Nigel Whittaker,
responsible for corporate affairs.
It will be interesting to assess the mood of Cordiant following the
departure of many high-profile employees, notably Maurice Saatchi.
The group is facing the new financial year without the important Mars
account and the prospect of having to compete to retain the
highly-lucrative British Airways contract.
Today, Britain's largest nursing homes group, Takare, is expected to
show continued strong growth with annual profits of around #20.8m. This
compares with taxable profits of #14.9m in 1993. The company has
recently been the subject of a highly-critical television documentary.
On Wednesday, Kwik-Fit, Europe's leading retail car replacement part
group, is expected to show the benefits of strong trading with pre-tax
profits of #27m, including the property surplus. This follows an
excellent first half when profits rose 33% to #15.2m.
Brokers Bell Lawrie White expects operating margins to go through 10%
(excluding Superdrive) in 1994-95 as enhanced profits flow from higher
volumes, the largely fixed cost base, greater clout with suppliers and
new product introductions.
The acquisition of Superdrive from Shell is viewed as a substantial
opportunity to enhance the centre network and market share.
United Biscuits, whose brands include KP and McVities, is heavily
involved in the current crisps price war, but it is expected to show
profits growth to #151m from #116.7m, when it reveals its annual results
on Thursday. Results will include a #25m restructuring provision. In
1993, the figures were boosted by a #65m credit.
Intense price competition in crisps forced UB to close its Grimsby
factory last November with the loss of 980 jobs. A surge in new crisp
capacity from late 1993, particularly from smaller companies geared to
supermarket own-label production, has triggered the price war. Six-packs
of crisps plunged from around 79p to as low as 29p last summer.
Branded products were not as badly affected but margins were still
under pressure. UB continues to attract bid speculation with Hanson
mentioned as a possible predator.
Insurer Legal &amp; General will show the extent to which it has been hit
by the slump in demand for personal pensions following the industry
scandal of mis-selling revealed last year. Lower pension sales coupled
with investment losses may see profitability drop by 9% to #166m.
However, the dividend is expected to rise from 20.1p to 21.7p.
Also reporting full-year figures on Thursday will be cable television
group TeleWest, whose franchise area covers Scotland, including
Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. These will be TeleWest's first results
since it floated on the London Stock Exchange last November.
It is early days yet for the cable operators in the UK and so
attention will focus on the growth in subscriber numbers and advertising
revenue.

A BRUISED and very angry Trafalgar House is expected to appeal to the
Takeover Panel this week about its insistence that the bid for Northern
Electric could only proceed with the consent of the electricity
distributor's board.
And Northern chairman David Morris will undoubtedly feel the wrath of
many shareholders who believe that he acted unilaterally by not allowing
Trafalgar to make its revised and lower offer of 950p cash at a time
when Northern's shares were standing at just 808p.
Last Friday, Trafalgar said that it was lapsing its original #11 offer
in the light of the changed circumstances following regulator Professor
Stephen Littlechild's remarks that he intended tightening the industry's
price controls.
The now much-abused Littlechild, who has been under huge pressure to
resign, said he will make clear his thinking on future pricing by March
24 although the details will not emerge until June.
It now seems quite apparent that he did not do his homework adequately
last year when he allowed the companies, including Northern, a much
looser rein than was justified and only realised his mistake when
Northern said it intended paying 507p to shareholders as part of its
defence.
That is still its intention despite the bid lapsing.
Trafalgar may argue that the circumstances are such that in equity the
Northern board should not have been allowed to scupper the #1040m bid
but instead shareholders should have the right to decide the fate of the
company they own -- but seemingly do not control.
Northern argued on Friday that Trafalgar seriously undervalued its
shares even although it had, admittedly reluctantly, agreed the #11
approach after sector shares crashed in the wake of the Littlechild
statement.
However, as the pricing mechanism remains shrouded in mystery, the
Panel may be persuaded to allow Trafalgar to bid again once Littlechild
does clarify his thoughts.
So far, the takeover attempt has cost Trafalgar a reported #10m.
A substantial paper loss appears to have been incurred by Swiss Bank
Corporation which in January conceded that it had built up a holding of
8.4%, or 17.2 million shares, in Yorkshire Electricity.
At the time, Yorkshire were trading at around 730p compared with
Friday's closing 676p for shortfall of almost #10m.
Yorkshire hit a high of 909p on hopes of a bid from Hanson and so was
one of the hardest hit after the Littlechild announcement, diving to
595p at one stage.

Moscow, Sunday
THE matinee ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre went ahead today but dancers
said a backstage rebellion over the theatre's director, which caused
Friday's performance to be cancelled, still simmers on.
The dancers went on strike for the first time ever on Friday after
Yuri Grigorovich, artistic director and chief ballet master of 30 years,
quit following a long dispute over the running of the theatre with
director-general Vladimir Kokonin.
''Nobody likes Kokonin,'' said one dancer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bolshoi artists have been forbidden to give interviews.
''But the public are paying a lot of money to see us,'' she said after
the performance of the children's ballet Pinocchio.
The company appeared divided between those wanting to strike again and
those who felt the show must go on regardless.
There was talk among the ballet company that performances should be
halted until the end of March, one dancer said, but another said she
thought performances would go ahead as normal.
Dancers accuse Kokonin of being isolated from the company and
incompetent. The introduction of short-term contracts has upset artists
used to the Soviet era job-for-life system.
Yesterday Kokonin suspended 15 dancers who announced as the curtain
was due to rise on Friday that they were refusing to go on stage.
The performance of Sergei Prokofiev's ballet Romeo and Juliet was
cancelled, to the surprise of the audience.--Reuter.

YET another Scottish hi-technology company is about to make its debut
on the Stock Exchange.
Vision Group, the Edinburgh-based developer of low-cost
camera-on-a-chip products is about to raise #5m when its shares are
listed in the next few weeks.
Better known until now through its trading arm, VLSI Vision, the group
was a 1990 spin-off from Edinburgh University's Department of Electrical
Engineering, where managing director Professor Peter Denyer (41) worked.
The group's growing expertise in miniaturised, low-cost, low-power
camera systems has won it the John Logie Baird Award for Innovation in
1993 and the Photonics Circle of Excellence Award last year. It is, says
Mr Denyer, still managing to sustain its competitive advantage over
rivals like large Japanese corporations by being technically clever and
quick off the mark.
With a staff of 45, most of whom are shareholders or option holders,
Vision is still loss-making on the latest figures. In the year to July
1994, it lost #223,000 pre-tax on sales of #1.1m. In the six months to
this January sales totalled some #800,000 and losses were still pro-rata
in line with the previous figure.
But Vision is poised for significant further growth. Until now its
products have been monochrome. A colour version of its cameras, which
can be used in security applications, video entry phones, process
control, closed circuit television, toys and a host of other
applications, should hit the market next year.
Last November, Vision raised #2.5m through a private placing. The
latest issue of new shares, sponsored by broker Albert E Sharp, should
lead to a capitalisation of between #22m and #27m.
The management and staff, led by Denyer, commercial director Roy
Warrender and new finance director Colin Grant, will hold between 15%
and 20% of the enlarged action.
Vision's biggest backer is the Donnelly Corporation of the US, an
automotive parts group, with whom Vision is working to develop an
intelligent anti-glare car rear mirror, incorporating a miniature
camera. Donnelly will hold less than 30% of the equity after the new
issue.
Around #1m of the new money raised by the listing will be used to pay
off a loan from Donnelly. The rest will add to working capital, funding
the anticipated growth in demand for Vision's product range.
The group, which operates from offices in the Civil Aviation
Authority's Edinburgh HQ, carries out design, engineering and marketing
of its products, but sub-contracts manufacturing and assembly. The
custom chips are fabricated in Taiwan. But all the other sub-contract
work is carried out by Scottish suppliers.
In recent months a number of other high-technology Scottish companies,
including Calluna, Memory Corporation and Magnum Power, have sought and
gained listings on the UK Stock Exchange.

VERY little historical insight is required to work out that the early
seventies was one of the lowest points in the evolution of rock music,
and Friday's packed SECC was like a tribute to an era no-one should be
looking back on with any affection.
The bands and audience alike were too young to be hippies, and too old
to be punks. The grooves of the Doobie Brothers, once languid are now
turgid, as a scattering of original members did their best to compensate
for the absence of the most influential and talented of their number,
Michael McDonald.
Without him they go for musician overkill, with three guitarists, two
drummers and a sax player that made Kenny G sound understated by
comparison. Only the six-piece harmonies cover Tommy Johnston's
inadequacies as a front man and 1972's Listen to the Music is one of the
rare gems to emerge from the overwrought musical concoction.
Foreigner at least came with key original members Mick Jones and Lou
Gramm. The latter's sweetly soulful voice makes up for the aberations
that are the majority of songs he is charged with singing.
A clutch of mid-tempo soft rockers from their new album show that with
their more youthful band, they're at least growing old with a bit of
grace, unlike some of the hard rockin' hell (Juke Box Hero and Double
Vision) that is dredged up from their undisdinguished past.
In short, the Doobies are falling rapidly from a high stature,
Foreigner advancing slowly from a low one and at #19 a ticket, it's hard
to imagine anyone having too much fun finding this out.

A SHARP bounceback in retail sales, which fell by an unexpected 0.9%
in January, is being forecast by City pundits when the February figures
are published on Wednesday.
The consensus is for an increase of around 0.6%, but James Capel's
Adam Cole thinks this could easily be exceeded and he has pencilled in a
rise of 1%. If so the annual rate would pick-up from 0.2% in January to
2.6%. The CBI's distributive trades survey tomorrow may give a clue to
the likely outcome.
Also published on Wednesday are the February unemployment figures,
where a fall of around 40,000, in line with the recent trend, can be
expected.
January is an important month for pay settlements, and Cole is
forecasting that growth in average earnings will at last move up from
3.75% to 4%.
The RPI figures are not being published until Thursday of next week,
but later today the producer price data for February are expected to
show a further build up in inflationary pressures at the factory gate.
Output prices are being forecast to rise by 0.4% on the month, taking
the annual rate of increase up from 3.4% in January to 3.6%.
But there could be a let-up in the recent upsurge in input prices as
commodity prices fell back in February. Capel is forecasting a drop in
the annual rate from 11.5% to 10.7%.
February is not a crucial month for the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement. A drop in the PSBR from #5200m in February last year to
#3500m last month is likely.
TODAY -- Producer prices (February).
TUESDAY -- CBI distributive trades survey (February).
WEDNESDAY -- Retail sales (February); unemployment (February); average
earnings (January).
THURSDAY -- Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (February).
FRIDAY -- None announced.

FURTHER revelations from the collapse of Barings indicate that the
merchant bank appointed Nick Leeson to run its Singapore operations
despite knowing he had lied to City of London regulators three years
ago. He was refused a licence to trade on London markets after lying in
his application form, according to the City's Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA).
In March 1992, Barings put Leeson's name forward to the SFA for a
licence to allow him to trade in London. But when he filled in the
application form he claimed he had no county court judgments against
him, even though one had been registered in his name a year earlier for
the sum of #639.
''He answered to that question 'no', there had never been any county
court judgment against him,'' said SFA chairman Christopher Sharples.
''We made our own research and discovered that there had been. So he
lied on his form,'' he told BBC1's Panorama programme which will
broadcast its investigation into the Barings collapse this evening.
The #639 judgment, entered at Watford County Court, was reportedly in
respect of a debt owed by Mr Leeson to electronics company Hitachi.
A Sunday newspaper also claimed that a second county court judgment
against Leeson was entered in May 1992, two months after Barings had put
him forward for the City trading licence. This one was for a debt of
#2426 owed to the National Westminster Bank, but by then Mr Leeson had
been moved to the Far East by Barings.
The SFA, which regulates stockbrokers and financial institutions in
the City and licences around 40,000 traders, reportedly told Barings of
what Mr Leeson did but the bank went ahead and appointed him to the
Singapore job.
In an ITV World in Action investigation, which will also be screened
tonight, Mr Sharples said: ''We regard honesty as a key criteria and
having outstanding debts is another one.
''We wouldn't regard it as appropriate for somebody who owes money as
suitable for looking after other people's money, Mr Sharples added.
Mr Leeson will appear before a German judge today in Frankfurt for a
hearing on Singapore's extradition request.

YOU have to be careful when listening to one of the mighty symphonies
of Shostakovich. The ear is easily seduced by the sonic brilliance and
sheer wallop of his orchestral climaxes. Just as the composer himself
pulled the wool over the eyes of the Soviet authorities by encoding his
message in an apparently noisy popular rhetoric, so can a mundane
performance sweep an audience into an ovation.
The bravos and applause that greeted the end of the great Tenth
Symphony on Saturday night, after its performance under the
Hungarian-born conductor Peter Eros, left me perplexed. There must have
been people sitting in that hall who have heard a couple of performances
of the same symphony by the same orchestra over the last decade which
ferociously outstripped Saturday's pale imitation.
Oh sure, there was good playing: notable solo contributions, and the
occasional moments where the orchestra took the ball and ran with it.
But to these ears conductor Peter Eros just didn't have a handle on the
big picture, the broad sweep of the symphony.
Seldom have I heard Shostakovich's vast landscape, with all its
emotional contours and dizzy precipices, reduced to such a flat,
colourless, characterless wash. The over-riding question in my mind was:
how is it possible to invest such atmospheric music, pregnant with
meaning and message, with such utter vacuity?
A similar, neutral approach evaporated Haydn's First Symphony and
nearly threatened Bartok's Third Piano Concerto, which was saved by the
gloriously steely, brilliantly articulate pianism of Stephen Hough, all
power, persuasion, and character -- exactly the qualities Peter Eros
failed to elicit from the orchestra.
In fact, there was more genuine oomph from the band earlier in the day
when, with presenter Atarah Ben-Tovim in totally over-the-top format,
more than 2000 youngsters between the ages of six and 60 (and more)
attended the last of the hugely successful Children's Classics concerts.
Here was real atmosphere. Hundreds -- literally hundreds -- of kids
brought instruments, from recorders to cellos, from keyboards to saxes.
A recipe for musical disaster, perhaps, but they were skilfully
incorporated into Bizet's Farandole and -- to considerable effect --
Ravel's Bolero.
The Royal SNO under Nicholas Kok wired into these and other pop
classics, including Romeo and Juliet and the Sabre Dance. Contagious
excitement all round. So ended the first, massively successful series.
It will be back. And, I understand, next season geographical horizons
will be broadened. Watch out Aberdeen and Edinburgh.

Cairo, Sunday
THOUSANDS of cheering Egyptians today packed the streets of the
crowded slum of Imbaba, Cairo's former Muslim militant stronghold, to
give the Prince of Wales a raucous welcome.
The Prince, visiting a local youth centre built under a government
programme trying to revitalise the teeming, poverty- stricken district,
was given the kind of enthusiastic reception usually reserved for his
estranged wife.
Brass bands blared out anthems, musicians played folk music and Nubian
dancers performed traditional dances in streets decked out with flags
and posters. Banners, draped from balconies packed with onlookers,
welcomed the Prince.
Children released balloons which floated skywards bearing portraits of
Charles and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak.
But many residents, unaccustomed to prominent visitors, appeared
confused as to who exactly they were cheering.
''Where is Mubarak?'' asked 12-year-old Nadia. She said most people
had expected him to tour the area where he sent thousands of troops to
crack down on Muslim fundamentalism two years ago.
The Prince, visiting Egypt for five days, also toured some of Cairo's
Islamic monuments and met Muslim and Christian leaders.
He did not speak to reporters after the meetings but in a newspaper
interview published today the Prince called for greater understanding
between Muslims and Christians.
''I find it odd that people speak of a clash between Islam and the
West, because what binds our two worlds together is much more powerful
than what divides us,'' he told the government paper Al-Ahram.
''In the West, our judgment of Islam has been distorted by taking the
extreme as the norm. That is a serious mistake.
''Our two worlds, the Islamic and the Western, are at a crossroads in
their relationships. I believe that instead of indulging in mutual

IF you are at all uncertain about the relationship between Bonnie
Prince Charlie, an East Lothian sea port and the first fish supper, you
are well advised to seek out this community venture co-produced by the
Brunton Theatre and Edinburgh's Theatre Workshop.
That Making Up Time is one of the best community shows I have seen
owes a great deal to the strength of the acting; no mumbled lines
noncommittally delivered, but big, rounded eloquent performances, from a
large cast of adults and children backed by a well-disciplined band
playing its own elegant score.
But it's the imagination put into the staging and the script, written
by professional playwright John Harvey in conjunction with the company,
that makes this a dynamic and engaging piece of theatre.
Starting on the steps of Musselburgh Town Hall, where an irate
bureaucrat finds herself unable to get into the theatre, the production
draws us round into an atmospheric court yard, where dry-ice billows and
children perform historical cameos, before leading us back into the
theatre proper.
Once inside, there's a good deal of post-modernist deconstruction,
with plays-within-plays and multiple views of history, but despite the
complexity, it's all done with humour and theatrical flair.

Brussels, Sunday
DIPLOMATS and officials from the European Union and Canada were
working tonight to prevent a violent fish war in the North Atlantic.
After a day of behind-the-scenes exchanges, an EU official said a
meeting could be imminent after a row erupted last week when a Canadian
gunboat fired warning shots over the bows of a Spanish trawler in
international waters and took it into custody.
The EU charged Canada with ''piracy'' and acting illegally while the
Canadian authorities responded that they were merely safeguarding
dwindling fish stocks and that the EU fleet off Newfoundland at the time
was exceeding its quota.
The seized boat, the Estai, was fishing for Greenland halibut 28 miles
outside Canada's 200-mile limit at the time.
Eduardo del Buey, a Canadian foreign affairs department official,
said: ''We're willing to meet the Europeans. I'm sure in the next little
while there will be some signals from one side or the other.''
But the Spanish, often criticised for their record of breaking fishing
quotas, said they would not negotiate until the Estai was released.
Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said there was now no sign of
the other EU trawlers -- all Spanish or Portuguese -- in the disputed
area of the Grand Banks known as the Nose and Tail, where Canadian
gunboats continued to patrol.
''Canada has already said it wouldn't negotiate with the Europeans as
long as fishing is going on, but it looks as if the fishing has stopped
now,'' a Canadian fisheries department official said.
The Estai was arrested after Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
personally authorised firing across its bows. He was acting to give
force to a newly-passed Canadian law on fish conservation which is not
recognised by the rest of the world.
The future of this dispute now seems to hinge on how international
lawyers interpret the Canadian action and the Spanish boat's entitlement
to the size of its catch. The EU's case could be weakened if the Spanish
boat is proved to have been overfishing.
John Beck, EU ambassador to Canada, said the matter had to be resolved
by contact. ''It is the only way I can see,'' he said.
* Thousands of angry Newfoundlanders, thrown out of work by the
disappearance of fish stocks, massed today at St John's harbour to
express support for Canada's seizure of the Spanish trawler.
The Estai remained docked in St John's harbour today.

With a #12,000 prize at stake your vote counts as Glasgow selects an
artist for the Lord Provost's prize. Clare Henry draws pen portraits of
the contenders for Scotland's premier award
SIX artists, three judges and #12,000 make up Glasgow's Lord Provost's
prize to be announced on Thursday. The competition is wide open, but you
can influence the decision by casting your vote in the ballot box beside
the six oil paintings at Glasgow Art Gallery. You can also post your
nomination to Kelvingrove using The Herald's form here.
The pictures range from Crozier's abstracted landscape to Adams'
butterfly-wing Golden Crucifixion. Saville's impressive Nude and
Currie's powerful Bathers are large, memorable and will attract votes.
Byrne has undersold himself with a small new picture instead of his more
flamboyant, wonderfully dramatic oils. The public may find Adams' and
Crozier's semi-abstracts most difficult.
The #12,000 prize, inaugurated in 1992, is unique to Glasgow -- an
imaginative move by the district council. However, it began with a
disappointingly low profile, and has singularly failed to make its mark.
Originally the largest art prize in Britain, with more cash than the
Tate's famous Turner Prize, it crept on to the scene in conjunction with
the RGI's annual exhibition. Although the first two winners, David Mach
and Alison Watt, were well-deserved, the whole affair was a lost
opportunity. Few artists knew about the prize; it had no prestige; was
not promoted and so got little media attention.
When it was announced that the prize was to be cut from the RGI and
relaunched in a very different format, there was little reaction: people
neither knew or cared. The hasty, low-key announcement of the
shortlisted artists on February 23 did little to rectify this and shows
no sign of putting Glasgow on the map. However, it's early days.
The selection is quite brilliant and was made by three ''celebrity
judges'' who are also art collectors themselves: author A S Byatt, actor
Richard Wilson and arts administrator Joanna Drew. All three have been
guided by personal preference but, as Byatt says: ''That's no bad thing.
I'm not an art expert. My choice is bound to be idiosyncatic. If
idiosyncratic judges make idiosyncratic judgments over several years, it
could build up into an interesting prize.''
The judging on Thursday will follow Goncourt rules where in stages,
the artist with the least votes drops out of the running. The formula
has a certain rigour. It's mathematical -- and you can vote secretly.
The public's vote will be taken into account at every stage.
''Choosing was an awful decision -- especially as there are no
guidelines,'' Byatt told me. ''Is the prize for the best painter in
Britain? For a young up-and-coming artist? Is it to bring a Scottish
artist to the attention of the Glasgow public? The organisers themselves
are not sure.
''In the end I selected two painters whose work means a very great
deal to me personally. I also used a colour criterion as I'm currently
obsessed with colour; it's so mysterious. Both Adams and Crozier are
fine colourists. They also have a lifetime's track record of excellence.
There are too many awards for the young; too few for the over fifties.''
Drew ploughed through lots of catalogues but in the end decided on
work she had seen and knew well. ''We had to choose to artists 'of
outstanding quality', putting them in first and second order. Only one
had to be Scottish but I decided it was only sensible to choose two:
Currie and Saville.
''I first saw Currie's work in Bristol in the mid 1980s. Then I saw
his People's Palace murals and was struck by the rare ambition of a
young man tackling big public themes.''
Some have questioned the choice of ''celebrity judges'' but, whether
by luck or good judgment, it seems to have worked well. Now all that
remains is to get Glasgow the critical attention that this enterprising
Provost's Prize deserves.
Jenny Saville: ''People say, 'you paint naked, don't you?' It's not
straightforward as that -- but somehow I've been incredibly lucky,''
says the youngest artist and ironically, best-known of the six.
Since graduating from Glasgow in 1992 she's established a remarkable
reputation for her outsize female nudes which challenge the late
twentieth-century's tyranny of thinness. Her 1994 London show made
headlines; a recent BBC film consolidated her position.
Saville, the sole woman, was selected by the sole female judge, Joanna
Drew, a respected figure in the British art world. ''As she paints
herself, Saville's pictures lack the voyeuristic element inevitable with
a male artist. Most seductive is the way she conveys the luminous silky
bloom on stretched skin.''
Ken Currie: ''I had this bizarre dream. I saw a corridor of sheets and
figures running through. It's a tough image. Some see it as religious;
others as the Holocaust -- people being sent into the showers. I'm happy
it works on different levels,'' he says of Bathers.
Currie is one of the famous four Glasgow Boys who graduated in the
mid-1980s and took the world by storm.
His current London show is proving controversial. ''I don't paint easy
pictures. You can't make terror and pain into decorative art.''
Stuart McAlpine Miller: He is the wild card, a young unknown chosen by
actor Richard Wilson who stumbled on Miller's London debut and bought a
picture.
Miller trained in illustration at Dundee. ''I was always painting
though.'' Picked up at his 1990 degree show by a scout who bought most
of his work, Miller got a show and went to Tuscany for 12 months.
''I'm interested in the contradictions of everyday life,'' he told me.
''My work is surreal; stylised with a hint of satire and frivolity.''
Wilson, (Victor Meldrew in BBC TV's sitcom, One Foot In The Grave)
says: ''I find the details fo Miller's compositions quite fascinating.
You can always see new things in his work. For me that's one important
sign of a good painting.''
John Byrne: Twenty-five years ago he began painting naive pictures
under the pseudonym Patrick. Patrick did so well the joke turned sour.
Byrne gave up exhibiting in 1975 and switched to writing, producing
successes such as TV's Tutti Frutti. Now he's back painting his
favourite flagwaving Victorian boys. ''I like a lot of irons in the
fire!'' His picture, Scottish Boy With Japanese Wonder Shell is, he
believes, a new departure.
Norman Adams: Now 68 and head of London's Royal Academy School since
1986, Adams is the senior statesman. ''I do believe art should be
serious and passionate,'' he says. ''Early on I decided that my work
would convey some kind of message. I'm rather unsure of my faith but
religion presents me with subjects and problems I need to face.''
Adams was chosen by Byatt. ''His work is not what it appears. It has
an innocent decorative other worldly aspect but his Angel of Death has
menacing eyes. He uses touches of pink that can be read as pretty, then
re-read as shocking. He's gentle and wicked, angelic and demonic.''
William Crozier: He trained at Glasgow under Donaldson. In London in
the 1950s he knew Colquhoun and McBride, before going to teach at
Winchester Art School. A new studio in County Cork inspired the
dramatic, vivid colours and shapes of Sunset Journey.
''A painter paints every day, or nearly. Here I depict a landscape I
know well. The picture appeared during a period of high productivity.
There are times when it's only necessary to hang on to the brush; the
painting seems to paint itself.''
Byatt says: ''Crozier can do new things with old images; simple
ingredients that were always there. His landscapes make you sing. It's
as hard to add something individual to a long tradition as to do
something 'subversive'.''

Madras, Sunday
A WEDDING party of Indian peasants aboard a tractor-trailer was burned
alive today in a fiery collision with a bus and a chemical tanker that
claimed nearly 50 lives, authorities said.
A further 15 people suffered serious burns as the tanker exploded in
flames, spraying burning benzine over its victims, police said.
First reports, from local news agencies and police in the area, spoke
of 120 deaths in the inferno.
''We heard a terrific bang and saw a pall of black smoke and rushed to
the main road,'' said Sundaramurthy, a farmer from the village of
Sendamangalam.
''As we went near, we heard men, women and children screaming but we
could do nothing.''
Witnesses said the pall of smoke could be seen for miles as the tanker
carrying highly inflammable benzine collided with a bus while trying to
overtake the tractor-trailer on a narrow highway about 35 miles
southwest of Madras.
Police said they had pulled 48 badly-charred bodies from the wreckage,
including those of 10 children.
The tractor-trailer was carrying a group from a colony of Harijans or
Untouchables, people from outside India's rigid caste system who perform
the most menial jobs, to a marriage ceremony in a neighbouring village.
Local police chief Ramesh Kudawla told Reuters that 34 members of the
wedding party, eight of them children, perished in the inferno.
Twelve bus passengers, two of them children, and two drivers were also
killed, he said. Other passengers escaped by breaking windows.--Reuter.

Johannesburg, Sunday
A BRITON was arrested today after South African police unearthed the
decomposed corpses of two men reported to be linked with hit squads.
A police spokesman said three Britons were arrested after the bodies
were found on a farm southeast of Johannesburg, but two were later
released.
The man still under arrest has not been named but is due to appear
before a magistrate tomorrow.
The spokesman said the bodies were those of black men and they had
been buried for about 18 months. Police are investigating claims of more
bodies buried in the same area.
Sources told the Johannesburg's Sunday Times that one of the Britons
had claimed the bodies were linked to hit squads run by the Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom Party and the white neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement, or AWB.
Inkatha has denied involvement in the work of hit squads. AWB
spokesman Fred Rundle said he was aware of the report and had contacted
the movement's leader Eugene Terre Blanche.
It is not known whether the bodies were members of hit squads who fell
foul of their masters or hit squad victims.
Hit squads were active, mainly in the Zulu heartland of Natal province
and in townships around Johannesburg, until just before last April's
all-race elections.--Reuter.

AN orchestra on international tour should be an orchestra at its best,
but could this be said of the Warsaw State Philharmonic last night? To
lose Chopin's E minor piano concerto through the indisposition of the
soloist, Yonty Solomon, was certainly a mishap which, in the audience's
eyes, must have seriously deglamourised the evening. Yet the chance to
hear a sumptuous piece of early Szymanowski instead was just what
Poland's leading orchestra should have been providing anyway.
Szymanowski's Concert Overture, Op 12, certainly possessed the right
sort of rarity value. But alas an air of unease hung over this plush
Polish tribute to Richard Strauss, just as it did over the works by
Mahler and Prokofiev that followed.
What went wrong? Perhaps Kazimierz Kord and his players had been
appearing in too many different halls, perhaps they had no time to get
the balance right in Edinburgh, but it seemed more likely that what we
heard were simply inexpressive performances that too often slid over the
surface of the music.
Three weeks ago, in the same surroundings, the BBC SSO made infinitely
more impact in a not dissimilar programme.
The same could not be said on this occasion, even of a work as
sensational as Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, though whether the fault lay
in the absence of a backcloth -- usually provided by the theatre on
concert nights -- or in Kord's failure to galvanise his players was hard
to say.

Karachi, Sunday
GUNMEN rampaged through the Pakistani port city of Karachi today,
killing at least 15 supporters of a rival ethnic group.
Afaq Ahmad, who leads a breakaway section of the Mohajir National
Movement, called the shootings ''carnage''.
His splinter group has been locked in a bloody vendetta with the
movement's main body, which is led by Altaf Hussain, who lives in
London.
Unidentified gunmen in vehicles mounted with machineguns attacked an
office used by the breakaway group this morning, killing its six
occupants after a three-hour gunbattle.
Some of the attackers barged into nearby houses and fired from
rooftops and balconies.
Police in an armoured personnel carrier made one attempt to stop the
battle, but withdrew after coming under fire.
Witnesses said police and paramilitary rangers stopped people from
entering the area where the shooting took place.
The gunmen were still on the loose hours later in the Pak Colony area
of the city, which had turned into a ghost town as occasional bursts of
gunfire echoed across deserted streets.
A mainstrean movement leader tonight denied his group's militants were
behind the attacks and killings.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto reiterated a promise to deal ruthlessly
with those responsible for violence in Karachi, where two American
consulate officials were shot dead last Wednesday.
''We will confront those who believe in terrorism and militancy and
those who are drug barons,'' she said in a speech in Lahore.
Police arrested at least 77 people in overnight raids on more than 100
homes of suspected militants in Karachi.
Bhutto accused drug barons of financing groups behind the violence
which has cost 89 lives this month and 332 this year.--Reuter.

Film-maker David Hayman thinks a lot about Glasgow . . . but has a few
choice words to say about all those who do their best work sitting down.
Allan Laing feels the full force of the man and his message
THE story about his head is apocryphal. No, says David Hayman with a
wry smile, I don't shave it bald when I'm directing so that I'll stand
out from the rest of the crew. I just fancied doing it. Another
celebrity myth bites the dust.
It's growing back, the hair. Stands to reason in the circumstances. A
chrome dome is okay if you're playing Kojak but who ever saw a
cantankerous, hard-bitten, newspaper editor with a shaven head? Anyway,
Hayman will look a little less threatening with his hair on. And he
still bites deep with his incisive remarks.
We are sitting around a conference table in the third floor open-plan
offices of the Glasgow Development Agency. Only tonight it's not the
GDA; it's the newsroom of an unnamed daily paper. Hayman is taking a
brief 30-minute respite from his directorial duties on The Near Room, a
moody, noir, crime thriller which is currently being shot in and around
the city.
Film crews are a bit like the tooth fairy. When everyone's gone to bed
they sneak in, with their cameras and their sound equipment, with their
dazzling lights and their huge pantechnicons parked outside, and they
work their cinematic magic until the sun comes up. And then they leave.
In the morning you won't find a sixpence under your pillow but you'll
find the detritus of the movie industry, empty packs of Marlboro and
plastic coffee cups crushed to death in the waste paper bins.
The Near Room will be the next Shallow Grave, though they are very
different in terms of style and content. The Glasgow Film Fund has
dipped into its pocket and found #150,000 to help finance the movie and
cash has also been provided by British Screen Finance. It has also
received substantial international backing from the Australian-based
Smart Egg Company.
It is a contemporary black thriller, a feature film which stars Adrian
Dunbar as a journalist who discovers that his estranged 16-year-old
daughter is in deep and dangerous trouble. His investigations lead him
through a complex web of moral corruption in local government, the
police, the judiciary, and (heaven forfend) even the newspapers. The
movie is self-contained in Glasgow (even the post-production work is
being carried out in the city) but, in artistic terms, it could be
anywhere in the world. Which is a strength.
Hayman the director has afforded Hayman the actor the luxury of an
acting role in the film, as Dunbar's nail-spitting editor boss. It is
only the second time he's double-booked himself for a film. The first
was last year when he directed and starred in the Newcastle gangland
thriller series, Finney.
The funny thing about Finney, of course, was the fact that most of it
was filmed around Glasgow. This should come as no surprise when you
consider what the city means to Hayman -- which is almost everything. It
is also a testament to his directing talents that, as an unsuspecting
viewer, you couldn't see the join.
So why this thing about Glasgow? ''I was fed up commuting to the
South. But I had to justify Glasgow creatively. If I can't then it just
doesn't work. With both Finney and The Near Room I knew exactly what
time and money I had and I knew that Glasgow could double as anywhere,''
he explains.
''It's one of the most photogenic settings around. Look at the variety
of architecture -- you've got Georgian, Victorian, Edwardian, the lot.
Then you've got the slums, and the housing schemes, and the office
blocks. It's also a very proud city, built on seven hills, and that
gives you vistas almost like San Francisco. In 20 minutes you can be in
the lochs and the rivers and be completely isolated. And, on top of all
that, you have wonderful skies which are constantly changing,'' he adds.
There is much more than that to Glasgow for Hayman. There is an energy
in the city, an energy you don't get anywhere else except maybe New
York. Bothwell Street, as long as you don't point the camera too high,
is a dead ringer for Manhattan.
But there is still a downside to Glasgow. That civic commitment to the
film industry, which has manifested itself in hard cash and willingness
from the local authorities, has yet to filter through to the officials
on the ground. To the jobsworths.
Recalling some little local difficulty he had with a big polis while
filming Finney in the city centre, Hayman says: ''For instance, there's
still that wee fascist patrolling Mitchell Street on a Saturday night
who says 'You're not filming here'. You know, it's the janitors who run
this f***ing world. We are up against the jannies. And until they see
the virtue of making movies then it will always be a problem.
''I've brought #7m worth of work to Glasgow in the last
year-and-a-half. That's been spent on resources and transport and
catering as well as film jobs. Now that is quite a boost to the local
economy. But still we're regarded as a bunch of vagabonds, gipsies,
arty-farties, dilettantes, who are kind of irresponsible. Now, I don't
regard managing #7m as irresponsible because, if it was, then we would
not get the next #7m to make movies.''
A couple of years ago, at the official launch of the Glasgow Film Fund
in the City Chambers, Hayman stood up and made a celebrated speech in
which he, as a film maker, looked forward to the day when he would blow
up a car in George Square. It was his colourful way of appealing for a
grassroots commitment to making movies.
''We don't have that yet. I'm sorry but why did Scotland lose
Braveheart to Ireland? It wasn't just because of tax breaks. It was
because Mel Gibson wanted 300 horses and no one would get them for him.
We should have said 'You want 300 horses, we'll get you 300 horses.
We'll f***ing fly them in for you if we have to'.'' he says.
Scotland has to start thinking creatively; positively. It can't just
say ''We can't do this or we can't do that.''
Hayman freely, almost proudly, admits to a preference for Celtic
actors (Dunbar is an Irishman). But he skilfully avoids the temptation
of making his central character a Scot. He allows him to perform in his
own Irish accent. His producer, Len Crooks, explains the reasons behind
it well. Glasgow, he says, is a pluralist city. There is nothing
remotely strange about an Irish journalist working here. Again, it is
like New York where there is a rich mix of ethnic communities --
Italians, Polaks, Irish, and Puerto Ricans.
Hayman adds: ''The Near Room is a Celtic film and that's what I like
to do. The English middle-class work doesn't attract me because I tend
to think that the English are mahogony from the neck down. Celts act a
part with a passion. Even when they've no talent they still have that
passion and they can channel their emotion into whatever they do.
''The English are an extraordinary race. They approach life as an
academic exercise; they stand back. Whereas the Celts meet it head on.''
So what does he think of Adrian Dunbar?
''What, apart from being an Irish gobshite?'' he quips (irony, even
when it is affectionate, is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a movie
director). ''No he's great. We're pals. He did a television thing called
A Woman's Guide To Adultery which I directed and we had just such an
easy relationship. He was my first choice for this film.''
Hayman is impressed by the current crop of young Scottish screen
actors. People in their early 30s like John Hannah, Bobby Carlyle, Ewan
McGregor, and David O'Hara (who co-stars in The Near Room). Why should
such a talented set of actors appear now?
''Well, the Tories took over the country 15 years ago and all our
lives were f***ed. It meant that, if there were no opportunities for
kids, then they thought, f*** it, I'll just become an actor. They
couldn't get trades or professions so they thought they had nothing to
lose. So more and more working-class kids turned to acting,'' he
explains.
By now the natives are getting restless back on the film set. A girl
with a clipboard approaches and tells Hayman two minutes. ''Sorry, I'll
have to go,'' he says, placing his baseball bunnet on his head and
bounding off with the energy of an athlete. Suddenly the phone rings.
Only it's not a phone ringing. It's Hayman doing an uncanny
impersonation of a phone ringing. Is there no end to this man's talents?
Possibly not.

Jerusalem, Sunday,
PRIME Minister John Major, drawing a line under past differences with
Israel, pledged Britain's support today in the fight against terrorism
and the search for peace in the Middle East.
Major, accompanied by businessmen hoping for a share of the peace
dividend, will hold talks with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in
Palestinian-ruled Gaza and with King Hussein in Jordan during a
three-day trip.
''Historic differences are behind us, and we are bound now by
friendship, respect, cooperation and understanding,'' Major, on the
first visit to Israel by a British Prime Minister since Margaret
Thatcher in 1986, told Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
''Our political relationship, as you and I have both said, has never
been so warm, has never had so much content and common ground,'' he said
in a dinner speech in Jerusalem.
Anglo-Israeli relations reached a low point during the 1987-1993
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, when British officials
criticised the Israeli army's use of force.
The deal in 1993 for Palestinian self-rule has improved ties between
Israel and Britain, which held a 26-year mandate over Palestine until
Israel was founded in 1948.
Major praised Israel for pursuing peace but said setbacks were
inevitable. Steady nerves would be needed.
''The UK will stand shoulder to shoulder with those who search for
peace,'' said Major, enjoying a respite from domestic opinion polls
showing him to be Britain's least popular leader in modern times.
He rejected a relaxation of international sanctions against Iraq and
said the lesson for the Middle East from Britain's experience in
Northern Ireland, where 25 years of guerrilla war cost 3200 lives, was
that peace without security was impossible.
''There can be no place for violence in a democratic state,'' he said.
''We agree that terrorism is a common enemy and must be implacably
opposed.''
Thanking Major for his support, Rabin said: ''No doubt, we will win
the struggle against the terror even if it lasts for a long
time.''--Reuter.

Copenhagen, Sunday
THE United States and Cuba clashed over market economics at the United
Nations social summit today, setting out contrasting visions of how the
world can best tackle poverty and unemployment.
But on the last day of the week-long gathering, with 182 countries
represented in Copenhagen, the summit approved a plan that pledged to
eradicate poverty, social injustice and unemployment.
Vice President Al Gore, insisting that Washington would maintain
foreign aid despite pressures from the new Congress to cut it, said the
US believed free markets alone could guarantee permanent economic
advance around the globe.
''In our view, only the market system unlocks a higher fraction of the
human potential than any other form of economic organisation, and has
the demonstrated potential to create broadly distributed new wealth,''
he declared.
But Cuba's President Fidel Castro said there could be no social
development ''where chaos and anarchy reign under the blind and savage
laws of the market''.
The ''neo-liberal doctrine'' being imposed on the world since the fall
of Soviet communism, he said, ''sacrifices shamelessly in the
under-developed countries spending on health, education, culture, sport,
social security, cheap housing and other basic needs of the people.''
The conference, the Summit for Social Development, has heard there are
more than one billion people living in poverty around the world and 120
million -- well over one third of the global work force -- unemployed or
under-employed.
Speakers from both developed and developing countries have warned that
unless these people are given some hope for a better future, disaster
lay ahead.
''The widening gap between rich and poor is more explosive than
ideological differences,'' President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya said.
''There can be no economic stability or security in society without
social justice,'' said Swiss social affairs minister Ruth Dreifuss.
Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, in a statement closing the
summit, said the UN would review progress on its summit commitments in
the year 2000. ''I would like, when we meet five years hence, to look
back to this summit of hope . . . as a summit of fulfilled
expectations,'' he said.
The summit declaration and plan of action, which runs to some 90
pages, said: ''We make this solemn commitment on the eve of the fiftieth
anniversary of the United Nations and with a determination to capture
the unique possibilities offered by the end of the Cold War to promote
social development and social justice.''
They also pledged to cut the debt burden of developing nations.
The documents have been condemned as ineffective by hundreds of
non-governmental organisations and pressure groups who also came to
Copenhagen and issued their own counter-declaration calling for much
more radical action.
Many of the leaders who have spoken have also expressed underlying
scepticism on whether the promises in the non-binding plan will be
fulfilled.
Speaking for the European Union, Commission president Jacques Santer
struck a more optimistic note, saying he hoped history would record that
the gathering had not been a ''North-South summit''.--Reuter.

THE Liberal Democrat leader yesterday urged voters to turn the
education cuts into the ''poll tax'' of 1995 and deliver a roar of
protest in local elections.
Mr Paddy Ashdown warned that a generation of children will pay with
their futures to save the Tories' skins at the next election.
The Government had cut grants to education authorities to hand out
''tax bribes'' before the next election, he told his party's spring
conference in Scarborough.
In the opening shots in the campaign leading up to the local elections
on April 6 in Scotland, and May 4 in England and Wales, Mr Ashdown urged
voters to reject the cuts in a ''referendum on Britain's future''.
He said: ''The people who told Mrs Thatcher to go, the people who said
the poll tax must go, will speak again. Their message will be that if
the Tories want to cut education then the Tories must go.''
He added: ''What more do you need to know about this Government than
that they will make our children pay with their futures to save the
Tories' skins at the next election?''
He said: ''These cuts aren't skin deep. They are cuts to the bone,
cuts that mean fewer teachers, larger classes, a poorer education for
our children. In fact they are more than cuts -- they are acts of
vandalism.
''And what are these cuts for? For one purpose only: for Tory tax
bribes at the next election.''
The cuts meant #50 less for every primary school pupil; #200 less for
every secondary pupil; #6000 less for every class of 30; #120,000 less
for every school of 600 -- equivalent to six sacked teachers.
Mr Ashdown also turned his fire on Labour.
He warned that beneath the party's slick new image lurked old-style
socialism.
''There are two Labour parties. The one you see is new Labour --
bright, shiny, modern, and the one you don't see is old Labour biding
its time,'' he said.
He pointed to the failures of Mr Bill Clinton's presidency in the
United States as a warning to Labour that it must spell out its policies
and stop ducking the issues.
''What happened to the Clinton administration in November's elections
ought to be a lesson to us all on how quickly the honeymoon of a hopeful
new government can turn into the nightmare of a broken-backed one.
''It would be a catastrophe for Britain and near-fatal for trust in
politics if the same were to happen here to a government elected on
fuzzy promises and public relations gloss.
''The message for Labour is simple. You can't change Britain by
ducking the issues. You can't beat the Tories by dodging the questions.
You cannot fill a void with avoidance.''
The Liberal Democrats are hoping to overtake the Tories and come
second in the local elections.
They have had meteoric success in recent years in local elections,
increasing their number of councillors from around 800 in 1979 to some
4600 today, and they now control 40 councils across Britain.
However, Mr Andrew Stunell, political secretary of the Association of
Liberal Democrat Councillors, admitted: ''We've been very successful in
the last few years but we are obviously reaching a plateau of what we
can reasonably expect to win.''
The party is defending 2200 seats across England, Wales, and Scotland
against a tough challenge from a vibrant new modernised Labour under Mr
Blair, but Mr Stunell is hoping to make significant gains against the
Tories and even predicts net gains against Labour.
Meanwhile the party was gearing up for its full General Election
campaign by announcing that Mr Alan Leaman, 36, once the head of Mr
Ashdown's office, is to step into the new role of director of strategy
and planning.
He will co-ordinate links between MPs and constituency parties as well
as chairing a key committee of senior staff to plot election tactics.

ENEMY WITHIN -- THE RISE
AND FALL OF THE BRITISH
COMMUNIST PARTY
By Francis Beckett
John Murray: #19.99
IT IS difficult to say just how much irony Francis Beckett intends by
his title. Margaret Thatcher's paranoid insult to the National Union of
Mineworkers may have entered the language like a tick burrowing beneath
the skin, but the old CP was always rather more -- and sometimes much
less -- than the political fifth column of right-wing imaginings. There
is more to this story than its headline.
For one thing, it is almost impossible today to imagine a political
movement in which courage, sacrifice, and philosophical endeavour could
be held in such perfect equilibrium with abject conformity, moral
cowardice, and intellectual paralysis. Thinking of old communists, the
hardest thing to understand is not the depth of their commitment but
their limitless capacity for self-deceit, for twisting gut belief to
accommodate outrageous lies. The eyes of scientific socialism were ever
blind.
For decades the CP was the conscience of the British left and yet it
was also, time again, more obstructive of socialist unity than any agent
provocateur. Even when the leadership was right -- taking on Mosley or
recruiting for the Spanish War -- it contrived to be wrong. The party
which first tried to affiliate to Labour, and which worked hand-in-glove
with the ILP, turned somersaults when Stalin snapped his fingers,
adopted ''Class Against Class'', and reserved its special venom for the
''social fascists'' of the non-communist left.
The party which first identified true fascism for what it was, not to
mention the party members who fought on the Ebro or at Jarama, could
within a few short years back the Nazi-Soviet pact with all the glib
fervour of used atrocity salesmen. And the people who hymned liberation
from imperialism could yet, somehow, find it in themselves to stay mute
over the invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
In Beckett's story all roads lead to Moscow. Had it survived, the old
CP would have been celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of its
founding this year; yet it collapsed, history will show, as a
consequence of the Soviet Union's collapse.
For 71 years the British party marched in step with the Kremlin, even
when that meant going round in circles, and losing its brightest and
best on the way.
It was fed by Soviet gold and enthralled by Soviet myths; it had seen
the future, and the present was merely a contradiction to be resolved.
If that meant self-deceit, so be it; if that meant turning yesterday's
scorned lie into today's bright truth, discipline could be made its own,
monkish consolation. If that meant betraying the very ideas of Marx
himself . . . well, another party line would be along shortly.
But the contradictions were, in the end, unsustainable. After the
romance of ''Euro-communism'' in the eighties, and the brief, puerile
glamour of Marxism Today (whose editor is now an executive with the
revolutionary Independent newspaper), weariness and fratricide were all
that remained. When the party was disbanded in 1991, amid squabbles over
assets, something called the Democratic Left emerged. It was modern,
cleansed of ideology, and, as events have shown, pointless as a result.
The Soviet Union corrupted what it inspired; that much is clear enough
from this account if it wasn't clear before. Good, sincere people -- and
a few brutal opportunists -- were used in an imperial war they believed
to be a proletarian struggle. Most never realised they were being lied
to -- not least over ''Moscow gold'' -- but most managed to lie to
themselves when the truth of what had happened in the USSR became plain.
Nevertheless, while Moscow was the villain of the piece it was also a
genuine source of inspiration and illumination. Whatever the Russian
Revolution became, the very fact that it could happen at all was a
revelation to the British left, and not just to Marxists. The old
regimes could be overthrown; the world could be turned upside down; the
disinherited could win justice. Soviet communism was a beacon in the
darkness. In calcified, consensual Britain we have forgotten what that
means: profound change was possible.
For that, much was forgiven and much ignored. Before Stalin's
slaughters were known (or admitted) communism was not some fantastic
dream but a rational choice, perhaps the only rational choice. In 1942,
party membership peaked at 56,000 but there were many more on the left
who baulked only at the CP's demands for obedience while embracing its
programme.
Communism was a vision shared, a thing of almost Platonic purity that
no corruption could touch. It was, and remains, an odd delusion for
materialists to suffer. Beckett's solid, well-paced narrative serves as
reminder of just how many Scots devoted themselves to the dream.
There are the famous names here, of course -- Willie Gallacher, Mick
McGahey, Jimmy Reid -- but also figures now almost forgotten. Who
remembers Arthur McManus from the Clyde, 28 when he chaired the CP's
inaugural conference, whose ashes lie in the Kremlin's walls? Or Jack
Murphy, who had the ''honour'' of proposing Trotsky's expulsion from the
Comintern executive? Or Bob Stewart from Dundee, who had been jailed for
opposing the Great War and who pleaded with the new party to suppress
''the manufacture of alcoholic drinks''?
Beckett tells a story of hope betrayed, but his tale's conclusion is
not entirely bleak. Post-communist Russia, as he points out, has yet to
prosper from its liberation. Equally, we could add that when a
capitalist country collapses into dictatorship or economic chaos no-one
then concludes that capitalism itself is discredited. Ideas are more
enduring than political systems.
Events may yet show that the Soviet Union's demise was the best thing
that could have happened to what remains of a movement born of a belief
in simple justice. With Western politics converging on the dull, dead
centre while 30% of the world's workers are unemployed, history, which
is not mocked, may yet have some tricks up its sleeve.

Sarajevo, Sunday
AN anti-aircraft round hit the jet carrying UN special envoy Yasushi
Akashi and his two top generals today as the plane landed at Sarajevo
airport, UN officials said.
A large hole from the bullet's impact was clearly visible on the right
side of the plane's fuselage just behind the rear window. The round
narrowly missed a passenger's head.
Akashi vowed he would not be intimidated by the attack.
''I do not know who did it but nobody can intimidate me with this kind
of thing,'' the special envoy told reporters a few hours later. ''I'm
rather insensitive to these matters.''
Accompanied by Lieutenant-Generals Bernard Janvier and Rupert Smith,
his senior military commanders, Akashi arrived in Sarajevo for talks
aimed at salvaging the fraying truce between government and separatist
Serb forces in Bosnia.
Today's airport incident was the most serious attack on senior UN
officials in nearly three years of war here.
Peacekeepers in Sarajevo reported the plane had been hit by a small
arms round. UN inspectors in Zagreb, where the aircraft returned, said
the plane had been holed by a 20mm round capable of bringing an aircraft
down.
''They've measured the size of the hole in Zagreb and they think it
was a 20mm round,'' said Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward, a UN spokesman.
No-one was reported injured in the incident but a passenger on the
aircraft, who asked not to be named, said the bullet hit with an audible
thud and came within one foot of the head of a French officer.
''Some people hit the floor of the aircraft when the round struck,''
the source said.
The bullet struck a suitcase being carried as luggage, passing through
a suit and stopping in a shoe.
''Somebody owes me a new suit and a pair of shoes,'' said the British
peacekeeper whose wardrobe was damaged.
Nato war planes thundered over the airport area after the incident,
firing chaff and flares to confuse any anti-aircraft missiles in the
area.
UN sources who were present at the airport as Akashi landed said at
least three shots were fired and seemed to have come from Bosnian Serb
positions south and east of the runway.
The airport sits between Bosnian government and separatist Serb front
lines.
A Red Cross plane was hit by a machine-gun round yesterday at the
airport, which then closed for the day.
Reporters awaiting Akashi at the airport, who were not immediately
aware his plane had been hit, asked the special envoy if Bosnia is
sliding back towards towards war.
''I would not use such a dramatic term but we are concerned about the
degredation of the situation,'' he said.
''The purpose of my visit is to see if we can stem the tide of this
degradation.''
Meanwhile, a drift towards new war in Croatia was apparently halted
today by a deal averting the forced withdrawal of UN troops there.
Just as war in neighbouring Croatia seems to have been avoided, Bosnia
continues to slide towards major fighting before the May 1 deadline for
the expiry of the current ceasefire.
Croatia's agreement under international pressure not to expel UN
troops monitoring a truce with its rebel Serb minority appeared to head
off the nightmare of a broader Balkan conflagration this year.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said UN troops could stay until a
new mandate was worked out for a reduced UN presence in the former
Yugoslav republic.
He was speaking at a news conference with US Vice President Al Gore in
Copenhagen, where they are attending the UN social development summit.
The agreement partially reverses Tudjman's earlier decision not to
extend the Security Council mandate of the 12,000 UN troops now in
Croatia when it expires on March 31.--Reuter.

A NEW fund to help Scotland's most disadvantaged communities could
come into operation later this year if the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland agrees to set it up.
The Kirk's national mission board is seeking approval to establish the
Priority Areas Renewal Foundation, which would be a grant-making body to
support Church and community projects in poor urban and rural areas.
Money would be raised by an appeal to all Kirk congregations and by
fund-raising efforts directed at sources outside the church.
The board believes the foundation would transmit a positive message to
communities in need.
The Rev Ian Black, board convener, said yesterday that the project
represented a big step forward for the Church, and would show how it
could help local people in priority areas.
The proposal for a new fund to help disadvantaged communities was
first made to the 1990 general assembly.
The 1992 assembly agreed to set up local pilot projects with central
Church funding, and grants totalling #56,119 have been awarded to 18
projects.
The board's report says that the situation of people living in areas
of multiple deprivation has deteriorated since 1990, and poorer areas
have become poorer.
Areas such as Glasgow and Inverclyde show increases of 15% and 14%,
the Highlands 25%, and Fife ''a staggering increase of 144%''.
The board says its research shows a considerable number of parishes
with at least 50% of the population living in areas classified by the
Scottish Office as being among the most severely deprived in Scotland.
The initiative was welcomed by other denominations which have
established similar grant-making schemes in recent years.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson has attacked ''nationalist
cranks'' who posted letter bombs addressed to him, Labour leader Tony
Blair, and the party's London headquarters.
Extremists claimed that the action, timed to coincide with the
Scottish Labour Party conference at Inverness, had been taken in support
of Scottish self-determination.
Three devices were delivered on Friday and, in a phone call to the
Press Association the following day, the self-styled Scottish National
Liberation Army said three others, posted to unspecified addresses, were
not due to arrive until today.
No-one was injured in any of the incidents involving the three devices
already delivered.
A crude letter bomb addressed to Mr Robertson and made from matches
and lighter fuel arrived at the Eden Court Theatre conference venue but,
having been spotted by staff, was removed from the building before Mr
Robertson arrived.
A similar device was delivered to the County Durham home of Mr Blair,
who was at the Inverness conference at the time. His agent initially
dismissed it as a prank, but later contacted police.
Police were alerted to a package sent to Labour Party headquarters at
John Smith House in Walworth Road, south London, after it was discovered
by a member of staff. The office where it was found was evacuated and
explosives experts called.
Mr Robertson said: ''A handful of nationalist cranks have not diverted
us in the past and they are not going to do so now. Democratic
politicians should never be intimidated by this kind of threat.''
Sources within the Labour Party suggest the devices sent to Mr
Robertson and Mr Blair were inert but that the one delivered to Walworth
Road could have caused burns. It is not known to whom it was addressed.
Mr Blair's agent yesterday told how he looked inside the letter sent
to the leader's home in the village of Trimdon Colliery while opening
the mail.
Mr John Burton said: ''The envelope containing the device looked no
different to the others. I saw the device but thank goodness it was not
triggered. I thought it was a hoax and I just got on with my work.
''It was much later when I thought to ring Special Branch as they
always need to be told of any odd events at the house.
''I wasn't concerned in the slightest until I was told it was a
genuine device. That came as a real shock.''
A spokeswoman for the Northern Constabulary confirmed they were
continuing their inquiries into the device sent to the Eden Court
Theatre.

DEFENDING the level of nurses' pay, Dr J A Duncan states that nursing
is a vocation (as opposed to a job) and as such presumably can carry low
remuneration (February 28).
The spurious term vocation is conveniently used by those in well-paid
jobs who are eternally thankful that people exist who are prepared to
undertake unpopular but essential tasks for the lowest wages.
Youngsters who have a vocation for merchant banking can expect to earn
more than nurses, unless of course they are clobbered by the
imponderable vicissitudes of lady luck.

CONFERENCE speakers took issue with the Labour-appointed Commission on
Social Justice's proposal that higher education students should have to
repay all or part of the costs of studies.
Mr Nick Small (Edinburgh Central) said it was central to socialist
beliefs that education should be financed by the community through
taxation.
Ms Marianne Stewart (Aberdeen South) asked: ''Do we really want to
saddle students at the beginning of their lives with that debt?''
The proposers of a critical motion expressed ''total condemnation'' of
the commission's recommendation but did, however, agree to remit it for
consideration by the Scottish Executive, whose Ms Rhona Brankin said a
Labour Government would ensure no student was denied higher education
for lack of financial support.
Delegates also condemned the use of league tables of school
examination results.

IT should be stressed that the man wearing the Pink Floyd T-shirt was
one of a kind, the bulk of last night's sell-out crowd being dressed
aggressively a la mode Glaswegienne, ie, in clothes which were around
three sizes too small. Nevertheless, his presence made me wonder. In the
wake of two Brits Awards and three best-selling albums, have M People
got too big and mainstream to be useful, in the manner of Messrs
Gilmour, Mason and Wright?
Additionally, you see, there was the fact that M People favoured us
with an interminably-portentous 10-minute black-out, plus two minutes of
loud noises and flashing lights, all the better to herald their
entrance. And most tellingly of all, their percussionist was sporting
the metropolitan rockbiz's age-old token of ultimate contempt for
audiences north of Hadrian's Wall: blimey, when in Jockland, wear a
kilt, man.
But thankfully, while M People have grown in the year since they last
visited Barrowland, they haven't grown stale. Her voice may not have the
most expressive of ranges, but Heather Small's stage persona now
expresses a leonine air of command. There is more to her these days than
simply her possession of pop's most distinctive palm-tree top-knot.
Mike Pickering, upon whose northern soul record collection and DJ's
crowd-pleasing nous M People's success has been built, also seems to
have sorted out his on-stage role. Stuff musicianly cred and waving a
saxophone about -- be a cheerleader.
Having endured a couple of slowies, Mike assured us of an increase in
the beats-per-minute ratio. We danced and danced and danced. Presumably
that included the man in the Pink Floyd T-shirt.

The humour and the bitterness of the miners' strike have been captured
in a collection of personal stories.
Ann Coltart recalls that struggling year
THE miners' strike which ended a decade ago, is seen as one of this
century's major markers in Labour history. It is felt as a daily deal
with devastation, in communities and individuals fractured by what
happened after that passionate year, 1984-85.
With thousands of other non-mining people, my own life was affected
strongly by that period. I delayed my planned move to Scotland by
several weeks in 1985, while organising a miners' benefit in south
London. Saturdays were spent at the local market, collecting canned
goods, sanitary towels, baby food, dog biscuits, shaving soap, and more
bizarre offerings with the help of curates, communists, pensioners, and
kids giving pocket money.
There were speakers on the issues of the strike everywhere you went
and women came out on British and European platforms with great
eloquence, in accents from all our old coalfield areas. Political gay
groups supported the strike and the macho National Union of Mineworkers
later showed solidarity with them.
Now, it is the worst of times, for those people who went through the
struggle and live with the material defeat and its aftermath. Why should
anyone fight for the privilege of spending a lifetime in hot, dark,
mucky underground passages doing hazardous work likely to clog up the
lungs in later years?
This is a question still asked after the pits have closed, one after
another, with thousands spewed out on to the top soil. Mining
communities have always had a special culture. It may have been
romanticised, but it was strongly there, with roots spread well before
the twentieth century, bred on the perennial knowledge of risk and
danger, a mutual support this encouraged below and above ground and the
geographical factor of whole villages dedicated to coal production.
The fragmentation of some of these communities, the wounds to the
culture, are movingly illustrated in a collection of personal stories
from men and women in Scottish mining areas.
Joe Owens, a former miner who now works as a freelance journalist in
Glasgow, has gathered and edited their tales under the title A Decade of
Endurance. This is not an over-dramatic naming. Through the grit and
humour, bitterness, bewilderment, disappointment, and pride in the
history of that struggling year, these storytellers leave us with a
smell of smouldering disaster.
A human landscape seems to have been gradually rubbed away, with the
recent, speedy loss of our traditional industries. The miners, long in
the forefront of moves to improve working life and its rewards, are
eloquent in expressing a drip-by-drip decline in the past 10 years. Jobs
connected with the mines have gone, shops, businesses and social centres
are closed, unemployed young people turn to drugs and disillusion,
families are splintered.
Danny Gemmel, from Auchinleck, left the colliery when it closed in
1988, spent some time on the buroo, and some in a factory. He took a
youth education course and now works at his local community centre. But
he is a miner still. ''I'd go back tomorrow,'' he says. ''You ken the
people you're working with. I miss it, everybody, a' the miners dae . .
. ''Everybody worked thegether, everybody worked in a unit.''
Offered a transfer to England after nine years at Monktonhall and a
brief spell at Bilston Glen, Alex Shanks of Edinburgh took his
redundancy pay and recently went into the oil industry, though he too
would go back to the pit if given the chance. He speaks of those who
bought their own homes and then ''found that the village became a ghost
town''.
''They couldn't get a job and couldn't sell the house,'' he says,
''because why would somebody move into a mining village that hasn't got
any prospects for work? They're trapped.'' One of the developments which
most impressed those involved with the strike was the fierce, tireless
efforts made by the women. All the miners one meets say they changed
their attitudes towards women during that year.
Helen Gray is a bar steward from Cumnock, married to a former miner,
whose feelings about herself and politics changed radically as a result
of the strike. ''I wouldnae hesitate to go and support anybody in a
struggle for a just cause,'' she says. ''That's what's been instilled in
me.''
Sadly, though, she feels that the momentum, when wives were out of
their kitchens and being public speakers all over the country, have
drifted away. Another woman activist during the strike was grandmother
Margaret Armitage, who was secretary of the Polmaise Wives' Support
Group and then chairwoman of he central women's group in Edinburgh. She
tried to continue with the strong community involvement for a couple of
years after 1985, but found many women losing heart as pits were run
down. ''The pit was the hub and the village was the wheel,'' is the way
she explains it. ''When the hub went, the wheel just disintegrated.''
Joe Owens has included his own father's story in his book, like other
miners expressing no regrets about the strike, though he feels it should
have been settled earlier. There is also a contribution from Mick
McGahey junior, who speaks bitterly of big companies now being ''quite
happy for this country to become the Taiwan of Europe''.
Owens's introduction to this mixture of bitterness and pride is a
cutting indictment of the power interests, leaderships, and
victimisation in Britain's current history. For him, that strike was the
most important and formative experience in his life. ''Everything to do
with the experience is still raw and 10 years later the rage is still
with me,'' he writes. ''I think it always will be.''

THE traditional family was described as a safe haven for men but a
unit where women and children are most vulnerable by Ms Roseanna
McCreay, Scottish National Executive.
Replying to a debate on family and children she said the traditional
family unit was a symbol for the Tories who had a vested interest in
promoting it as part of their attack on the welfare state.
She said the agenda of the Child Support Act was being driven by a
group of ''articulate middle-class men''.
The conference approved resolutions which called for a Children's Act
for Scotland providing rights and protection for the child and asserting
that children ''are not only the responsibility of the family but of
society''.

Mexico City, Sunday
FORMER President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, under intense pressure
with the arrest of his brother on murder charges and claims that his
government was to blame for a deep economic crisis, has left Mexico for
good, a newspaper reported today.
The daily La Jornada said Salinas and his family left for the US on a
private flight yesterday and would not be returning.
A government spokesman and a man who answered the telephone at
Salinas' office in Mexico City both said they could not confirm or deny
the report.
La Jornada said Salinas, his wife and their three children flew to New
York and would likely move on to Boston to begin a new life.
And the weekly magazine Proceso said today that Salinas' political
exile was agreed on at a meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo, his
handpicked successor, at the presidential palace Los Pinos last Thursday
night. Proceso said the accord binds Salinas to stay out of public life
but did not say what he received in return.
Zedillo was scheduled to make a nationally televised address tonight,
but it was not known if he would discuss Salinas.
Salinas' reputation has come crashing down around his ears in recent
weeks and he has been involved in a messy public row with Zedillo over
who is to blame for the economic crisis.--Reuter.

PARTY conferences are all very much the same, and they all centre on
the leader's speech. I didn't have much of a view of the leader's
speech. I had only just managed to squeeze to the front of the upper
circle when Bambi bounced to the lectern.
To my surprise, Tony Blair incarnate looks just like Tony Blair on TV.
This is most unusual. Famous people, met or seen tend to be
disconcertingly different from their gogglebox image. David Steel, for
real, is small and creepy, Alex Salmond is bigger than you think, and
very much nicer.
But Blair really does bounce. Blair really does glow. And there is
That Smile. Blair walks with a smile. Blair talks through the smile. The
Smile was around before Blair, and -- like the Cheshire cat -- you feel
the Smile will still be shining, disembodied in the hall, long after he
is gone.
And so he speaks. Though I am far above and away from the leader of
the Opposition, it isn't a bad seat. I have a wonderful view of the
audience. I scan all the faces below. They are young, old, obscure,
famous. At the back of the hall are lots of MPs.
It is powerful to watch those faces -- intense, weary, somehow
vulnerable. It is powerful to see eyes turn up, and meet mine, and who
looks away at once and who does not.
Blair is a good speaker in that he holds your attention. He must be
reading -- advance copies were doled out before he took the stage -- but
he is so good at it you couldn't tell. Blair, notoriously, drips with
sincerity. Nevertheless, he patently believes every word he is saying.
Still, he can't preach. He seems to have no ear for music. There is
not the rhythm, the surge, the logic on fire of a King or a Kinnock. The
emotional range is too narrow, all remorselessly pleasant.
I think he botches his opening tribute to John Smith. In the same
breath, we are asked to mourn for the fallen leader; then, suddenly
Blair wants us to chortle at a bizarre anecdote of Smith getting bevvied
in Shanghai.
But he goes on; he injects urgency into the Clause 4 debate; he
demands support. Now you sense the oh-so-Scottish rising of hackles in
the audience. The worst moment is when Blair tells us of a recent rebuke
from a party activist. ''Mr Blair, I know Tories who are voting for
you.'' But what's the point of being new Labour, Blair appeals, if not
to win Tory votes? This falls on the audience like the proverbial
concrete kite. The laughter is distinctly forced. For much of the hall
there is a brief groan; one of two people actually shout.
The standing ovation is pointedly brief. Afterwards the lobby fills
with MPs eager to tell us what a wonderful speech we have just heard.
But many of the delegates are visibly underwhelmed. They will give Bambi
the benefit of the doubt. But the doubts abide.
********
PARTY conferences are all very much the same, and they all have
rumours. On Thursday night, oddly enough, they focus not on Labour --
this is the night of press relations chaos -- but on the SNP in Perth
and Kinross.
The selection meeting's at 7.30 -- and it's official -- every
journalist knows Roseanna Cunningham ain't gonna be the candidate. What
a hash Salmond has made of it! After 9.30 it's official -- every
journalist knows -- Roseanna Cunningham IS the candidate by miles. What
a hash Salmond has made of it again!
By 10.30, conference hacks have rallied gamely, the rumours now turn
purple, but there are laws of defamation.
All party conferences have boozy receptions, a tacky dance, some
night, exhibition stands manned by beautiful charming people, and lots
of fast food. (I'm reminded of Margo MacDonald's delicious dig at
Scottish Liberals: that she loved their conferences for the wonderful
home baking.)
I dodged the receptions: there is never anywhere to sit, and no one
important goes to them. It is impossible to dodge the exhibition stands.
The sole legal entry to the Eden Court Theatre is via a ridiculous
marquee packed with the things. Sometimes you wander round this maze two
or three times before finding your way out. The slick men in blue
blazers -- Hydro Electric, Scottish Nuclear, Law Society of Scotland --
promote their wares ruthlessly and without quarter.
On Friday night, rather against my better judgment, I have to go with
my brother to a tacky dance, because he insists on going and he has the
late key for the hotel. The event is in the bowels of the Caledonian. It
isn't a ceilidh, but a rather small staid disco. A local band performs
''covers'' of hits by Presley, Orbison and Clapton. By the look of them
-- cool, tired, bored, they've played every Highland wedding since 1983.
Brother networks mingle, I sit on the sidelines, watch the human
comedy -- nothing's funnier than the sight of ageing portly Scots,
bopping the night away -- and feel tired and existential. On the way
out, Brian Wilson asks me if I'm enjoying myself. All day he has been
determinately friendly.
''I think the operative phrase, Brian, is that this is definitely the
I've Never Been To A Better Party Party.''
I will say this for Labour. Over the whole weekend I've seen no
delegate or politician the worse for drink. I wish I could say the same
about the Nationalists.
On Saturday morning, I am rather hurt to hit a wall of hate at the
Eden Court. This is because of my ferocious report on press relations.
But Maureen Smith is, as ever, charm personified. Though hurt, she is
not bitter. ''I tried to do my best,'' she said simply and I believe she
did, hopelessly overworked within wretched resources.
The problem, incredibly, is a few other journalists, not the big
columnists and broadcasters present who agree with me to a man, but a
pool of tough, hard working, bitterly obscure reporters. One appoints
himself spokesman and bustles up to pronounce sentence. ''You'll be
hearing from my lawyer...most scurrilous article . . . we're all signing
a letter . . . there isn't a hall in Scotland big enough for the Labour
Party and your ego.''
The trouble is that I'm sure I didn't say anything remotely unpleasant
about any reporter in my piece. And I haven't a clue who this guy is,
but I'm too terrified to tell him that, lest he compare my ego with the
Moray Firth, to the latter's disadvantage.
This is John Macleod with ego writing on Saturday, faxing on Saturday
night, forced to phone back in and dictate the whole thing on Sabbath
afternoon because no-one can read his writing. And replete with fast
food, the Fourth Commandment, and oodles of guilt and socialism.

YET another blow in Mary Brennan's continuing assault on the Scottish
Ballet. There are a few questions to be asked about this most recent
garbage from her pen (March 3).
If she was at the opening night of Swan Lake, did she leave her eyes
and ears outside? Did she listen to any comments around her?
Are the ballet audience, in her opinion, easily pleased morons? Their
obvious delight with this brilliant production flies in the face of all
that she has to say.
Why does she not get together with her ''clique'' and admit that their
sole preoccupation is to criticise adversely anything done by the
Scottish Ballet in general and Galina Samsova in particular?

IN response to Sara Villiers's sweeping attack on the hopelessness of
men (International Women's Day), I should like to point out some facts
(March 8).
As a 29-year-old single man who has lived away from home for almost
seven years I have done all my own washing, ironing, cooking, sewing,
shopping, vacuuming, and cleaning. And I get myself up in the morning to
go to work.
My brother, on the other hand, at the grand old age of 32, still lives
at home, where my elderly, widowed mother washes, irons, cooks, sews,
shops, vacuums, and cleans for him before running him to work every
morning, after having got him up and fed and watered him.
I obviously don't want to embarrass my brother, yes, he is also a
rugby player, but I thought that Sara Villiers would like to know that
she was only half right.

<TEXT>
THE Scottish industrialist who founded modern Japan and became a
revered hero in the Land of the Rising Sun, is set to be honoured in his
homeland.
Thomas Blake Glover, who is thought to be the inspiration for the
Madam Butterfly legend, is largely unknown in his native Scotland but in
Japan he holds cult status. Statues have been erected in his memory, a
park has been named after him, and his mansion home in Nagasaki attracts
two million visitors annually.
Now plans are being finalised to turn his family home in Aberdeen into
a shrine to the ''Scottish Samurai''.
A delegation from Grampian is preparing to visit Japan to develop the
Glover link and pave the way for what it hopes will be a flood of
Japanese visitors back to Scotland.
''As a race they are curious about their own history and their roots.
We know the Japanese would be keen on a property which is associated
with Glover,'' said Mr Geoffrey Tudor, an official of Grampian Regional
Council.
Glover, the son of a coastguard officer, was born in 1838 in the
fishing town of Fraserburgh and educated in Aberdeen. At the age of 18
he set sail for the Far East to work as a clerk and launched a
remarkable career as an industrialist.
He arranged the building of the first Japanese warships in an Aberdeen
yard, was responsible for the first Japanese railway and helped to found
the Mitsubishi empire.
His marriage to a Japanese wife lasted for 30 years but he had an
affair with another Japanese woman, Maki Kaga, who bore him a son. This
is believed to be the inspiration for the poignant Madam Butterfly tale
famous in the Puccini opera.
Glover was the first foreigner to be awarded Japan's highest honour --
the Order of the Rising Sun -- and died a rich man in his adopted land
at the age of 73.
It is only in recent times that Glover has started to be recognised in
his native Scotland. Three years ago, Grampian region bought Braehead
House, Aberdeen, where the large Glover family lived.
The council plans to use it as a tourist attraction and as a centre
for Japanese studies. ''What we are proposing is to turn the house into
a Japanese-Scottish centre which we are sure would be of interest to
Japanese visitors,'' said Mr Tudor.
''We feel there is a need in Grampian, if not the whole of Scotland,
for a training centre offering information on language, manners, and
etiquette.
''These are very important areas for people thinking of going to Japan
-- especially if they are wanting to establish business links there.''
The council is particularly looking for help with the project from
Mitsubishi, the company with which Glover was closely connected.
''We hope they would be interested, especially because of the help he
gave the company in its early days,'' added Mr Tudor.
The council delegation, comprising of convener Gordon McDonald, Asian
expert Professor Ian Gow, and economic development director Howard
Fisher, had planned to travel to Japan in February but the trip had to
be rescheduled following the Kobe earthquake and is now expected to go
ahead in September.

SCOTS were asked to boycott all Bulgarian produce -- the main one
being red wine -- to support striking Klondikers.
Conference approved a motion from Shetland activists who sympathise
with the crew of a ship stranded at Lerwick for several months in a
strike over back pay.
Delegate Peter Hamilton moved for the boycott, claiming that the
crewmen of the vessel Rotalia had been denied their full pay for three
years and were being treated abysmally by the state company which
employs them.
He said: ''Their company has turned its back on them, their Government
would rather see them rot than win. Shetlanders have not turned their
backs on them and neither can we. We have to force the Bulgarians to
negotiate.''
He had recently received a letter from one of the early leaders of the
dispute, Milen Kochev, whose hunger strike in September had drawn
attention to the dispute.
He had now written from Bulgaria to say: ''We received a little
Bulgarian money and nothing more. I have to borrow from friends. Now I
am regretting I didn't rest in Shetland.''
Mr Hamilton said the state firm had been privatised and asset-stripped
by a local mafia and the men feared for their safety.
Conference approved his emergency motion calling for a boycott of all
Bulgarian produce. Those campaigning for the 26 crewmen of the factory
ship now plan to take the dispute to the European Parliament.

SO Patrick Mayhew goes to America and announces that the IRA no longer
needs to surrender all its weapons. But he does not stipulate how much
of its armoury it has got to surrender to win a place at the negotiating
table with the other parties.
Half? Quarter? One-third? One can see the ludicrous, almost comical
situation developing. A special conference, perhaps, to decide on the
precise amount of arms to be handed in and how many to be retained?
The demand in some quarters that it be all or nothing seems to be too
logical and sensible for some, yet there must be some explanation for
this unworkable and impractical climbdown (for surely it can be regarded
as nothing less) on Sir Patrick's part.
The whole thing, as usual, smacks of compromise and appeasement and
that, in Unionist eyes, can only be one-sided appeasement -- to Sinn
Fein.
No doubt this latest compromise was directed, partly, to the
Irish/American contingent in the United States. With a presidential
election looming, Warren Christopher must be seen to offer some sop to
ensure the Irish/American vote.
And with the British Government desperate to get Sinn Fein to the
peace talks with the other parties as soon as possible, Sir Patrick no
doubt felt that this would have been sympathetically considered by Sinn
Fein.
Yet it has had the opposite effect. It should have been abundantly
clear from the outset that Sinn Fein would never countenance the
surrender of any weaponry -- at least not at this stage.
Gerry Adams is still going on with the old argument about Sinn Fein
not being the IRA and therefore his party has no control over the IRA as
regards arms control. Yet it did seem to be fairly effective at the time
of the ceasefire.
The reaction of the Unionists was a foregone conclusion:
''surrender'', ''appeasement'', ''compromise'', ''another step to Dublin
rule''. These were predictable reactions. The Unionists will never
accept anything less than a total surrender of IRA weaponry.
Sir Patrick Mayhew and Warren Christopher have set the cat among the
pigeons again. One can hardly blame the Ulster Unionists for believing
that Sir Patrick is leading Ulster into fiercer rapid waters and he

AND all the while the doctors with the loudest voice were the spin
variety. The heart-wrenching saga of Child B's cancer treatment has
provided endless opportunities to explain to the public many things they
needed to know about the modern National Health Service.
How it is that the internal market has afforded welcome transparency
of decision-making. That rationing of treatments always went on behind
closed doors, but now has merely become visible. That technology has
long since overwhelmed resources and created infinite demands on finite
resources. That doctors have been stripped of high priest status, at
last allowing managers, those upright honest brokers of the peace, to
make rational, unemotional judgements. And like all the best and
blackest propaganda each of these statements contains enough truth to be
plausible.
It is what they fail to mention which gives us real insight into the
way in which the NHS has been dogmatically pushed into practices for
which it was never designed and which are wholly inappropriate to a
service rather than a business.
In some senses the medical story which should have rung the most alarm
bells this last week was not the case of the child with leukaemia,
tragic as it is, but the case of the man with a head injury who required
to be flown 200 miles to the nearest neuro-surgical bed.
Not a major train or airline crash, not a motorway pile-up, just one
patient in need of specialist intensive care and not a bed for him in
the whole of London. Not a bed for him anywhere in the south. And he
died in Yorkshire with the consultant admitting that the delay in
treatment could itself have proved fatal.
If that doesn't scare Mrs Virginia Bottomley then she has a
terrifyingly high shock threshold.
The shortage of acute beds, not least in major cities, is the direct
result of policies geared to minimum possible need, leaving no margins
for the vagaries of real life. A similar approach to staffing has left
whole wards and units closed up and down the land. Nursing, a profession
which, almost more than any other, requires continuity and commitment
has been driven into casualisation.
And the resultant dilution of provision is starkly clear in almost any
hospital you care to visit with medical staff morale in desperate
straits, -- senior staff finding themselves impossibly over-stretched
and their juniors routinely burdened with unfair levels of
responsibility.
Despite which the nurses find themselves the subject of wholesale
discrimination in the pay leagues. When the staunchly conservative Royal
College of Nursing finds itself contemplating some form of industrial
action then you know you have a health service which is terminally sick.
There are no such financial worries for the new breed of health
service managers with their executive salaries and top-of-the-range
company cars. And no chance whatsoever that this burgeoning breed of
medical bureaucrats will ever feel inclined to apply belt-tightening to
their own increasingly feather-bedded existence. A Government perenially
insisting on value for money might care to ponder why its reforms have
resulted in thousands more managers presiding over a universal
dissatisfaction with current levels of care.
But then a Government which can't see that the whole
purchaser/provider model is totally alien to the ethos of a nationally
available health-service perhaps lacks the capability to read between
the lines on the balance sheet.
But for many of us it is intrinsically offensive to contemplate a
hospital having ''used up'' its allocation of replacement hips, or have
its surgeons indent to a manager for permission to schedule operations
for fear the theatre budget may over-run. Which is not an argument to
let the health service become uniquely unnaccountable. But it is
abundantly clear to anyone looking in with an unprejudiced eye that the
days have long gone when the NHS could be accused of casual waste and
sloppy practices. The only budgets now able to blossom without
noticeable controls are those of the very accountants who were allegedly
in place to run ever tighter ships.
I am not persuaded that there ever was great enthusiasm in Scotland
for a more market-orientated health service, or indeed for NHS hospitals
to go for trust status. But it became apparent that those hospitals who
bought the new philosophy would find themselves looked on very much more
favourably by the Scottish Office and so they could quite literally not
afford not to play the game. Similarly some hospitals on the closure
hit-list saw trust status as a passport to survival.
The GP-fundholding saga has echoes of this. Scots GPs have been
significantly slower to embrace this brave new world than some of their
English counterparts. And some of the horror stories from down south are
unlikely to whet the appetites of the unconverted. Yet here too there is
evidence that fundholders are put in a position of being able to work
the system more effectively. Heaven forbid that we should accuse them of
allowing their patients to queue jump. They just contrive to create
shorter queues for which only fundholders' patients need apply. Not
quite the spirit of universal provision according to need.
There is one other significant change in the way we conduct our
hospital and nursing services which speaks volumes about the quality of
caring. Nobody who currently works in the health service is permitted to
talk about it. Those who have been sufficiently concerned to go public
with fears have found themselves sacked. There is now a specific clause
in all contracts expressly forbidding freedom of speech.
And what could be more eloquent about the result of the wrenching
changes in provision than those having to implement them being prevented
from discussing the effects. If the new-style health authorities are so
confident that they have presided over a benign revolution, how come
they are terrified to let the revolutionaries give an unrehearsed
endorsement?
The result of which is that journalists anxious to have first-hand
reports of life in the wards or detail the progress of community care
are advised by health union officials that nobody dare speak on the
record any more.
So you speak to health workers off the record, promising anonymity.
And the evidence is then ridiculed because you haven't named names. And
who'll believe the hysterical journalist when the soothing spin doctor
is to hand?

TONY BLAIR'S Clause 4 victory at Inverness was the first of what
should be a series of good days for Labour over the next couple of
months.
The party should do well in the Scottish local elections on April 6.
Later that month the national special conference should approve the New
Style Clause 4, due to be unveiled today.
In May, the Conservatives should suffer a crushing defeat in the
English local elections.
That, in turn, could precipitate a Tory leadership contest in the
autumn. If Mr Major were to go his successor might be tempted to cut and
run in May next year after a tax cutting budget in November.
How does Mr Blair look to be shaping up to the prospect of becoming
Prime Minister? Pretty well, must be the answer. He led from the front
on Clause 4 and he won in Scotland, a heartland of traditional
socialism.
He also did it without mincing his words. Labour, he told delegates,
would need lots of floating voters, lots of formerly Tory voters, to
gain power and he made no apology for courting them.
Party activists can prepare to be reminded in future years that Labour
is back in power because of these millions of ''unattached'' votes. Mr
Blair is bent on creating a new kind of socialist party and one of its
characteristics will be that it should not go out of its way to alienate
many of those who voted for it.
In 1966 as Harold Wilson coasted to a 100-seat majority many, pundits
as well as party faithful, thought Labour's time as Britain's natural
party of government had come. Instead, the administration degenerated
with internal Cabinet squabbles and increasingly bitter battles among
Ministers, the unions, and the party conference.
Thirty years on Labour's chance has come again. There is massive
dissatisfaction with the Government. There is also natural voter
weariness with a party which has been in power for a decade and a half,
is on the slide and unable to pull itself together.
On clutches of issues, Labour policy chimes in with what the public
regards, rightly or wrongly, as common sense.
Mr Blair has already, I believe, dispelled the fear of Labour which
cost it the last election when it should have won. On tax, on education,
in his sensible retreat from the early creation of English assemblies,
which only a few enthusiasts want, he has shown himself well attuned to
the mood of the electorate.
Some of the more thoughtful left wingers who disagree with many of his
policy revisions and changes privately admit they are unstoppable and
irreversible before the next election. They are concentrating on trying
to put down a benchmark of ''authentic socialism'' to which they can
refer if the Blair social democratic dream turns sour in practice.
As Cromwell's creation of the New Model Army assured military victory
for the Roundheads, so Blair's ideal of a New Model Labour Party,
validated by the party itself, looks set to sweep away another long
established regime.

Jerusalem, Sunday
AT THEIR meeting here tonight, John Major and the Israeli premier
Yitzhak Rabin swap notes. They have a lot in common as unpopular leaders
trying to negotiate historic peace processes in dangerous situations.
Rabin, the son of a British soldier, has a tiny majority of six in the
120-seat Knesset. Like Major, whose Commons majority now depends on the
Ulster Unionists, Rabin has fractious elements in his party.
They are both beset by extreme voices. Both are faced with General
Elections -- Rabin next year -- that will be hard, if not impossible, to
win. Both endure pressure from the United States to give more and move
faster in negotiations.
How to resolve problems that are still a matter of life and death in
Northern Ireland and those produced by the even more ancient hatreds of
the Middle East? Both men are constantly concerned by the intrusion of
terrorism, or the threat of it, into their endeavours.
Major is here to help as best he can, and to drum up trade. With him
are the CBI director-general Howard Davies and 28 top industrialists
whose object is to improve our exports, already worth #1 billion a year.
Among them, happily enough, are Richard Giordano of British Gas, the
highest-paid utilities boss and Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks
and Spencer.
The Prime Minister has publicly decried the ''windfall'' pay and perks
of the likes of Giordano. Davies has charged Sir Richard on behalf of
the CBI to devise a way to limit such top people's controversial
rewards. Perhaps the four of them will get together on this issue aboard
Major's British Airways Jumbo in the Middle East.
The prospects for business for British companies in Israel and Jordan
(where Major goes after Jerusalem) are immense if a lasting solution to
the Palestinian problem can be found. No stable peace settlement can
last without vast investment to bring economic and social benefits to
the Palestinians, millions of whom are still in refugee camps. So trade
walks with diplomacy on this visit.
Rabin realises this. He has pressed for Major to visit Israel as only
the second British Prime Minister (Thatcher, 1986) to do so since the
Balfour Declaration in 1917 pledging a national home for the Jews. The
last British troops left Haifa in 1948. Instead of being suspicious of
Britain's historic role in the Middle East, Rabin wants to use it.
He said on Saturday in an interview with a London newspaper: ''We
would like to see a more active role for Britain to be involved in the
economy of those countries that are engaged in the peace process, in
terms of economic assistance and the wider European Union effort.''
Last year Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel and this was marked
by Britain writing-off part of Jordan's debt to us. The Israeli premier
rejoices in this and is now lobbying for other Arab countries to get
economic rewards from coming to terms with his country.
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, whom
Major meets in Gaza on Tuesday, could fall at any time if he cannot
provide a better life soon for his people in real terms. The deal he
struck with Israel two years ago for Palestinian autonomy is foundering.
A new deadline, July 1, has been set for elections to a Palestinian
Council, the second stage of the agreement. But elections cannot be held
under the shadow of Israeli guns. Rabin will not withdraw his troops
from the Mediterranean Gaza Strip or the West Bank until Arafat has
crushed Arab terrorism, which has launched a vicious series of suicide
attacks against civilians and soldiers.
Arafat is ill-equipped to do so. Meanwhile, his people are subject to
severe restrictions on travel and working in Israel. Result: the
Palestinian economy has deteriorated since Arafat's agreement with Rabin
two years ago. Such influence as the Prime Minister has in the European
Union, both political and economic, is important to the Israelis.
Major brings Arafat Land-Rovers for his police force as a token of
solidarity. Our aid programme to Israel -- our third largest market in
the Middle East -- tops #75m and Major is expected to announce and
increase this while he is here. The accompanying businessmen might be
able to do more.
Job-creating British contracts in Gaza and the West Bank might prove
to be even more useful to Arafat. The Israelis need him, and his
fledgling police force, to be shored-up. They welcome anything that
Britain can do to achieve this. Rabin believes that the peace process is
stalled, and could be wrecked, by terrorism.
Major will argue that the Israelis need to take a risk by redeploying
their troops to allow elections for the Palestinian Council. Rabin,
politically besieged in a fragile coalition government, is obliged to be
obsessive about security -- and the lives and property of Jewish
settlements. He now acknowledges that some of those settlements,
particularly in built-up areas, were a ''mistake''.
But he is stuck with them and must leave it to them, for as long as he
remains in power, to decide whether they stay or move. He has still to
acknowledge a Palestinian ''state'' and is looking instead for a
''separation'' between Israel and a future Palestinian ''entity''.
He cannot give Arafat what he wants -- the restitution of East
Jerusalem as a capital for a Palestinian state. Israeli sensitivities on
this are such that they asked the Prime Minister to exclude Foreign
minister Douglas Hogg from this trip because they believed he planned to
visit Orient House, the symbol of Palestinian culture in East Jerusalem.
In Israeli terms, this would have equated to President Clinton
according Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams a visit to the White House and a
licence to raise funds again before a single IRA weapon has been handed
over. Major took the point. Instead of Douglas Hurd's No 2 at the
Foreign office, an official will observe the courtesies at Orient House
in the hope that this will be sufficient for King Hussein when the Prime
Minister meets him in Amman on Tuesday night.
Rabin is in enough trouble among his supporters for doing a deal with
Syria, restoring an area of the strategic Golan Heights. He requires
further assurances from Damascus before he dare step further in
restoring territory taken in war. Major is to visit Upper Galilee and
see for himself from the ''Syrian'' side of the Golan how easy it was
for shells to be lobbed down on the Israeli farmers and their villages
in the fertile valley below.
The Prime Minister has an opportunity to help the peace process in the
Middle East in the knowledge that it may not do him much good in the
opinion polls at home. He shares with Rabin the knowledge that he might
not be in power come the millenium.
Both leaders are left with little option but, as the Israeli premier
puts it, to do what they think is right for their peace processes.
Success may not win elections, but it gets them a place in the history
books.

ONE unanswerable argument in favour of a Scottish Parliament is
scandal. There isn't any. This is yet another area in which Scots are
utterly deprived, having to make do with titbits like the pathetic
''disclosure'' that Ms Roseanna Cunningham of the SNP had a dalliance
with an unattached man almost 20 years ago.
No, if we were a real nation with a real government we could claim our
rightful place in the new Europe and savour some fascinating,
rip-roaring scandals like the one which has the Belgians spellbound
right now.
Much envy is being expressed currently by the international press
corps in Brussels of our colleagues in the Belgian media. Belgian
newspapers and television have traditionally suffered a reputation for
being timid. This, after all, is the country where you can be prosecuted
for uttering a word of criticism of the royal family.
But in recent times Belgium's journalists have become inspired as they
continue to chip away at a vast and intriguing political cover-up,
possibly extending high into the Cabinet, designed to hide the sleazy
truth of the so-called Agusta affair.
Agusta is transfixing Belgium as you would expect of a conspiracy
involving bribery, corruption, Mafia murder, suicide and the emergence
of a folk heroine, a working mother, whose job as a magistrate is to dig
out the truth. Almost daily, it seems, there are twists and developments
in the Agusta affair, the latest of which came last week when the former
chief of staff of the Belgian air force, newly implicated, decided to
end it all by poisoning himself in a Brussels hotel room.
Agusta is an Italian firm of helicopter manufacturers which stands
accused of bribing prominent politicians in return for a #200m order for
46 attack machines in 1988 for the Belgian military. The sweetener was a
kickback of more than #1m paid into a Swiss bank account in favour of
some rather important people and their political party. The French are
suspected of offering their own bribes but we all know the Italians are
so much better at that sort of thing.
This story has had its hilarious moments. When investigative reporters
on the socialist-supporting Flemish newspaper, De Morgen, launched their
assault on the scandal they uncovered the awkward fact that some of
Agusta's money had been spent on funding their own newspaper. In other
words they had just exposed the racket that was paying their own wages.
They are still beavering away, however, wondering if they are gradually
doing themselves out of a job.
Liege, the Francophone second city of Belgium, is the centrepiece of
this unfolding tale. Liege is known locally as Palermo-on-the-Meuse
because of its notoriously corrupt politics. It was there that Georges
Simenon, creator of Inspector Maigret, was born and it would take a
platoon of Maigrets to unravel the complexities of the Agusta affair.
THAT daunting task has fallen instead to Mrs Veronique Ancia who just
happened to be the duty magistrate in Liege on the day four years ago
when the first hint of what was to come landed on her desk.
On that fateful day Ancia, now aged 39, was handed the job of looking
into the murder of a prominent local political fixer called Andre Cools.
Cools, former leader of the French-speaking socialist party, was gunned
down, Mafia style, by an assassin believed to be a professional hitman,
in a car park in Liege. It became clear than Cools had known quite a bit
about the Agusta affair and had decided to expose the truth.
His assassin is still undiscovered but last week an associate and
former vice-premier, Philippe Moureaux, created another sensation by
saying the murder had been organised by the same group which later
caused a national outrage by murdering a veterinary surgeon who was
fighting the Belgian practice of illegally injecting cattle with growth
hormones. In both cases a Mafia involvement was suspected.
What added spice to this development was the fact that Moureaux had
earlier made statements leading directly to the resignation of three
ministers. One of those ex-ministers, Guy Mathot, is now suspected of
plotting the murder of Cools.
This startling drama is, of course, followed nightly by a mass
audience on television and radio news bulletins in Belgium. Newspaper
and magazine readers devour acres of it. And all the time the wave of
revelations threatens to engulf two of Belgium's most prominent and
respected political figures. One is the gentle, popular and music-loving
former foreign minister, Willy Claes, who is now secretary-general of
Nato. The other is the European Commissioner for competition policy,
Karl van Miert.
Both men were in government at the time of the Agusta deal, Claes as
minister for finance. He has long protested he knew nothing about bribes
or sweeteners and proclaims his innocence. Then last week as the scandal
spread he suddenly admitted that he had a ''vague memory'' of it being
discussed. Claes's parlous position was not helped when his former chef
de cabinet, Johan Delanghe, was picked up and accused of corruptly
influencing the contract in favour of Agusta.
Belgians know the destructive potential of this affair only too well.
Theirs is a federal state, divided politically, culturally and
linguistically. If it was any more divided it would collapse. They can
hardly contain themselves as they await developments. I envy their
reporters who have the satisfaction of covering these events. Sadly,
when it comes to scandal the Scots are not at the races. Who will
relieve us of our respectability?

THERE would be no place for market forces -- introduced into the NHS
by the Tories -- under a Labour Government, the party's parliamentary
spokesman on Scottish health, told the conference yesterday.
Mr John McAllion, MP for Dundee East, said in-house pay bargaining,
which the Government was trying to substitute for national agreements,
was ''demoralising for staff and something that will not be tolerated by
a Labour Government''.
On Cambridgeshire Health Authority's recent refusal to fund treatment
for a 10-year-old girl dying from leukemia, Mr McAllion said it had
decided that ''in market terms, her life was expendable''. He added:
''If we are going to save the NHS, we are going to have to defy market
logic.''
Competitive tendering, market testing, and privatisation of NHS
services must be abolished by a Labour Government, the conference
resolved.
It approved a series of motions whose demands included ''the immediate
replacement of Tory place men and women'' on NHS trust and health
boards, with ''genuine representatives from the community, local
authorities, and trade unions''.
Conference also condemned the way in which the Community Care
programme was being conducted, and voiced concern at the reduction in
long-stay NHS beds for the elderly.
Ms Rachel Squire, MP for Dunfermline West, said elderly people were
being forced into private care. Ms Margaret Curran, Glasgow Central,
said: ''Yes, they let you buy your council house but you'll have to sell
it again in order to pay for your care when you are older.''

BOSNIAN refugees brought to Scotland to escape the horrors of war are
to be asked how their needs were met when they arrived.
Nearly 1000 victims of ethnic cleansing have been taken out of
Bosnia-Herzegovina or saved from Serb concentration camps in the past
two years and brought to Britain.
Cheylesmore Lodge, in North Berwick, was one of 11 reception centres
opened at short notice in Britain in March 1993, to give them temporary
refuge.
The lodge, the only one in Scotland, closes at the end of April
because the Home Office says Britain has taken its quota of refugees,
promised as part of a United Nations programme to help victims of ethnic
cleansing.
The Scottish centre dealt with 159 people, virtually all Bosnian
Muslims, who had been brought from the former Yugoslavia.
The Scottish Refugee council will today ask Lothian Regional Council
to help fund an evaluation of how well the refugee centre handled their
needs.
The move is part of an on-going assessment programme to help the
refugees settle in Scotland.
Twenty-eight-day old babies to 71-year-old men have all passed through
the doors of the lodge, a former Lothian Regional Council old folks'
home.
Six babies have been born to Bosnian women since they arrived in
Scotland, and at least four more are expected.
Refugees were moved to their own homes after up to six months, most
settling in the Lothians and Fife.
Ms Edita Kilic who has settled in Dunbar, East Lothian, said the
Bosnians had been well looked after.

DAVID WATSON's letter on funding residential care through the
Department of Social Security rather than the social work department may
unintentionally mislead some people (March 9).
First, he quotes regulations which do not have anything to do with the
scheme he suggests. More importantly, the levels of benefit he quotes
are not payable to anyone wishing residential care but only to a
claimant who is entitled to a range of disability benefits and premiums.
It is also wrong to imply that using the DSS to fund care will allow a
person to retain their family home. The DSS has exactly the same
expectation as the local authority that a person's house should normally
be sold and the proceeds largely used up before benefits can be claimed
to fund a residential care place. The same exceptions to this rule also
largely apply.
Finally, I would suggest that the fact that, under Mr Watson's
proposal, the resident may be left with no money of his or her own to
spend from day to day is far from a trivial objection.
Mr Watson's suggestion may be suitable for some people but the rules
are so complex that expert independent advice should always be sought.

A ROCK concert is being planned for RAF Stornoway on Easter Sunday.
However, an application by the Elgin band, Silent Breed, to get Western
Isles Council cash support for a tour next month of strongly
Presbyterian Isle of Lewis -- ending with the Sunday gig at the Tornado
Club at the RAF base -- is unlikely to find favour with councillors.
Tomorrow, the council's director of education, Mr Neil Galbraith, will
urge the arts and leisure committee to reject the application. A council
insider said: ''The official line will be that there is no money left in
the arts budget until the end of the financial year; but, to be honest,
these councillors would be much more likely to appoint Nick Leeson as
the next director of finance than give a single penny to a rock group
that is to play in Stornoway on a Sunday.''
The application comes from the band's agency, Ashleigh Reed Promotions
of Duffus, Morayshire, whose spokeswoman, Ms Sarah Cooper, said
yesterday: ''I do know about the local sensitivities. The band would not
play in a public place on a Sunday, but the RAF club is a private
club.'' She added: ''These bookings have still to be confirmed.''

JOHN MacLEOD's claim that the 1978 Garscadden by-election was thrown
away by the Nationalists via a hopeless candidate and general
incompetence should not be allowed to go without further comment (March
7).
The main mistake made by the SNP in that campaign lay in its
exaggerated expectations of victory which bore little relation to its
standing in the public opinion polls, indicating a dramatic slump in the
party's popularity since the 1977 district elections when it won all six
Garscadden wards.
It is often forgotten that a mere six weeks after Garscadden -- at
another by-election in Hamilton -- the SNP fielded its most charismatic
candidate, the then senior vice-chairman, Margo MacDonald, the victor in
the 1973 Govan by-election.
Not only did she fail to win the seat -- which was easily held by
Labour's George Robertson, now Shadow Scottish Secretary -- but her
percentage share of the vote was around 5% less than the percentage
share achieved by the previous SNP candidate at the October, 1974,
election and she had a majority against her of nearly 6500, almost 2000
more than the Labour majority in Garscadden.
In contrast SNP prospects of success in the forthcoming Perth and
Kinross by-election are much more soundly based than they were in either
of these 1978 by-elections. At the last election -- with Roseanna
Cunningham as its candidate -- the party was only 2094 votes adrift of
the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, and since then it has been consistently
ahead of the Tories in successive public opinion polls.

THE contradictions of the Scottish Labour conference were summed up
when the party approved a radical left agenda less than 24 hours after
Mr Blair won his victory on Clause 4.
In spite of giving the Labour leadership the right to redraft the
historic clause, delegates began the following day by adopting one of
the most left-wing sets of principles that any conference has adopted.
The conference approved a resolution on economic policy which called
for increased public investment in manufacturing, construction, and
public service. It also demanded, in apparent contradiction to the
previous day's outburst of modernisation, a campaign ''for increased
intervention, taking back into public ownership public utilities''.
The motion demanded that the profits generated from this should be
used to regenerate industry, improve road and rail links and create a
house-building programme. It also called on conference to dissociate
itself from the monetarist attitudes of the Government and called for a
progressive tax system, national minimum wage, and restoration of the
NHS to its position as ''envy of the world and free at the point of
need''.
This composite motion on economic policy was moved by the Transport
and General Workers' Union in Scotland. Regional organiser Jimmy Elsby
said that the bringing back into public ownership of key utilities was a
cornerstone of the union's policy and, in spite of the previous day's
setback over Clause 4, he saw this as to some degree setting the record
straight.
''We want to see a Labour government with the political will and the
economic drive to make real our long-term vision of a modern
manufacturing economy,'' he said.
''We want to see intervention and to make intervention really work. We
believe it requires common ownership. Let's give our people new hope.
Let's begin the process of creating a new type of common ownership --
run for the people, by the people -- and let's understand that we can't
fully control something we don't own.''

E KEATING suggests banning teachers from driving (March 3). As a

So may I suggest that it is the vast number of children being driven

IT is not my brief or intention to enter into correspondence on the
M77, however, I will make the following observations to try to clarify
the situation in respect of the trees (March 1).
The spiking of trees raises two points in particular. The first is
simply danger.
A saw chain comprises a number of razor-sharp teeth, anything from
30-100, and can rotate at 3000 revolutions per minute. Should one of
these teeth break due to striking metal, it could fly off, blind, maim,
or ultimately kill either the operator, a fellow worker, or other person
in the vicinity.
Albeit that safety clothing may be worn by the relevant workforce it
cannot guarantee absolute protection, a point of which the Health and
Safety Executive is aware.
A similar situation arises if spiked timber reaches a saw mill --
again an innocent worker could suffer -- or if an individual tries to
cut the wood for a domestic fire.
The second point raises the question of spiked quality timber having
to be disposed of by other means, ie burning, dumping, etc. Good quality
timber having to be ''thrown out'' is an on-cost to the environment in
that whatever purpose the wood might have been used for, other timber
will have to be cut to replace it.
It will be interesting to see if trees which will be retained after
completion of the contract, of which there are many, will have the
spikes withdrawn and bark damage repaired.

I CANNOT match Dr J D Duncan's 40 years in general practice (February
22), but in my 39 years I have worked in Glasgow, the Armed Forces,
Lanarkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Rutherglen. I am able to draw
comparisons between the affluence of patients in ''leafy Bucks'' and the
sometimes abject and almost inescapable poverty of many in Glasgow.
The positive correlation between deprivation and morbidity/mortality
is striking and is confirmed by an extensive bibliography in the medical
literature on the subject.
We are fortunate in having Dr Harry Burns as our director of public
health in Glasgow (February 13) not only for his high academic standing,
his practical clinical experience, and his administrative and
communications skills, but also for his clear human compassion -- the
traditional hallmark of the good doctor -- and his courage in stating
the painfully obvious.

A NEW Clause 4 setting out Labour's commitment to public ownership --
but making no mention of full employment -- will be presented to the
party's national executive committee today by leader Tony Blair.
Mr Blair and deputy leader John Prescott spent yesterday at the
leader's London home drawing up their version of what the party's aims
and values should be to replace the 77-year-old commitment to wholesale
nationalisation.
Although the final form of words remained secret yesterday, various
members of the Shadow Cabinet gave hints as to what the new Clause 4 is
likely to include: a commitment to social justice; a pledge to keep
''power, wealth, and opportunity'' in the hands of the many, not the
few; and an affirmation of the party's belief in ''opportunities for all
to work and flourish''.
Support for public ownership will be balanced by a commitment to a
strong private sector. And Mr Blair has decided to risk angering
left-wing unions by omitting any mention of full employment.
Labour members who have campaigned against the scrapping of the
party's blanket commitment to the ''common ownership of the means of
production, distribution, and exchange'' last night condemned what they
consider a defeat for Mr Prescott.
During the leadership campaign last summer, Mr Prescott emphasised his
belief that the fight for full employment should be at the heart of the
party's constitution.
Left-wing MP Diane Abbott said on BBC radio: ''I think it's felt it's
too radical a commitment and poor John Prescott is just going to have to
eat his words. It's quite clear that full employment won't be in the new
clause, and a lot of people will be unhappy with that.''
Union leaders appeared to concede the abandonment of full employment.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB, said: ''I think we have
to use language that people can understand. People can understand full
employment.
''If the words aren't going to be there, I very much hope that there
will be a phrase that people can see means that everybody has the
opportunity for work during their life.''
Mr Blair's campaign for modernising the party was reinforced in
Inverness, where the Scottish Labour conference voted by 58.3% to 41.6%
in favour of change. Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown told the conference
yesterday that the new clause should express ''lasting principles and
timeless values''.
He added: ''So when people ask where we stand, let us tell them we
stand where we always have. The party of justice, fairness, and
equality, and an economy -- public and private, run in the interests of
all -- at work for the whole community, a chance for all to work and
flourish.''
The abandonment of a written commitment to full employment was
signalled by Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett, who explained
that the new Clause 4 will emphasise individual initiative.
''The principle of developing and using everyone's potential and
giving people rights obviously leads to the conclusion that you need to
allow people to earn their living, to be self-reliant, to determine
their future, and I think that will clearly be reflected in the final
wording,'' he said.
He also emphasised that the new Clause 4 will not commit Labour to
specific policies. He told BBC television: ''Tony is very keen that it
should not look like a composite resolution produced by a donkey so we
want to make sure the wording is both sharp and coherent but above all
that it expresses principles.''
Mr Blair expects to get his version past left wingers on the NEC
today. But arrangements have been made for a further meeting on
Wednesday in case of resistance.
The Scottish Labour Party conference gave Mr Brown a standing ovation
-- rivalling that for the Labour leader -- for a speech which suggested
that top echelons of the party were agreed on the formula for the new
Clause 4.
Mr Brown alluded to economic employment and educational opportunities
in an address peppered with stock phrases such as the casting out of
poverty, the banishment of discrimination, the conquering of injustice,
the equitable distribution of power and opportunity, and rewards ''for
the many and not just a few''.
He said: ''New Labour means new equality for women'' and spoke of
poverty being banished, injustice removed, inequality ended, and wrongs
righted.
Mr Brown also affirmed that Labour would introduce a windfall tax so
that those running the public utilities would pay for emergency measures
to get Britain back to work.
In what sounded on occasion like a sermon, the son of the manse said
he was there to ''preach the gospel of discontent, to praise the virtues
of moral protest''.
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, had told the
conference earlier that Labour stood for a publicly-owned national
railway system and public service working in the public interest. The
repeated praise for the public sector was seen as a deliberate
counterpoint to Friday's debate in which common ownership was the key
issue in redrafting Clause 4.
He further insisted that Scots did not want to be separate from the
rest of Britain, but part of a Labour nation, as opposed to the
undemocratic, over-centralised, quango-ridden, economic failure run by
the Tories.
He finished his speech with a broadside against the SNP. He said: ''At
a time when barriers are crashing down throughout Europe, why on earth
would we want to build new borders in Britain.''

I AM grateful to Mrs Matheson for contributing to the huge task of
raising public awareness of Argyll and Clyde Health Council.
Health councils are statutory bodies. They exist uniquely to represent
the public interest in the NHS. When was this ever more needed than now?
In Argyll and Clyde discharging this responsibility certainly entails
communicating the existence of the health council to all our local
communities.
Mrs Matheson's letter clearly demonstrates we have been successful in
reaching out to even the more isolated areas of our geographical
responsibility.
I would sincerely urge her to read Argyll and Clyde Health Council's
annual report. This would be of much assistance to her if she wished to
contribute informed comment on the range of complex challenges and
difficulties facing today's NHS.

YOUR Medical Correspondent reports on the call for new powers to
reduce the risk of exposure to asbestos (March 4).
The list of people mentioned by health experts as being highly at risk
due to previous exposure ought to have included the other ordinary
citizens living and working for years in the very shadow of the
factories whose products and production processes were the cause of
these ''cancer fears''.
The long latency period of mesothelioma has been effectively exploited
by officialdom at all levels in its endeavours to conceal the true
extent of the health problem caused by asbestos nationally and
internationally.
Mr Ian McKechnie, of Clydeside Action on Asbestos, accurately
pinpointed a factor in this concealment when he said that the powers of
the Health and Safety Executive were insufficient.
In one large public building situated down-wind and only yards away
from the factory site in Clydebank, readings relating to internal
pollution were taken by the district council's officials about 12 years
ago.
The readings were resolutely withheld from public knowledge and from
those employed within the building itself. An appeal to the Health and
Safety Executive for help in regard to this received no consideration
and its reply stated only that such readings were covered by the
Official Secrets Act.
This was done at a time when the factory lay derelict and vandalised
with masses of the dangerous material lying exposed and scattered
throughout the roofless buildings and putting all in the locality at
great risk.
If the HSE were to be given power to bring criminal prosecutions, as
Mr McKechnie proposes, I wonder where it should begin.

IT was one of those glorious evenings which will linger in the memory.
The King's Theatre in Glasgow buzzed with anticipation as the orchestra
burst into overture, the curtain rose on the shapely Tiller Girls
walking slowly across stage in jerky caricature of those two lovable
layabouts.
And then the pair themselves -- Francie and Josie, released for the
night from the Pittenween Home for the Bewildered and let loose on an
audience which responded with such acclaim as I can seldom remember in a
Scottish theatre.
Both now in their seventies, Rikki Fulton and Jack Milroy were
creating last week the kind of electricity which reminded you
immediately that you were in the company of superstars.
It is no secret that I have long regarded Fulton as the greatest
comedy talent I have seen in 50 years of music hall entertainment. It is
35 years since he first teamed up with the rubbery Milroy in a chemistry
of pure genius which makes you sigh for an age which, in the city of
Glasgow alone, could offer you a broad choice of top-class entertainers
in any one week.
They say there is still a big wide world of music and entertainment
out there but the generations have become so polarised and the fare so
fragmented that there are gaps which cry out for attention.
Everything has become specialised in a range of rivalries, from
classical to jazz and country and western, from pop to punk and rap and
some pretty dreary theatre. Whereas we are kept well informed on the
alleged merits of this broad canvas, you would have searched hard to
find any media mention of that magnificent night of music and laughter,
costume and colour, which was familiar to the golden oldies but had
clearly come as a surprise to a later generation.
While savouring the sheer excitement of the evening, I was deeply
conscious of that other dimension in which younger people were
experiencing, perhaps for the first time, what a night out in Glasgow
used to be like.
This was a taste of what their parents had been describing -- the old
Empire, the Alhambra, the Pavilion; the great names of Tommy Lorne, Dave
Willis, Tommy Morgan, Jack Radcliffe, Harry Gordon, Alec Finlay, and
more recently Jimmy Logan, Stanley Baxter, Lex McLean, and Johnny
Beattie.
They all raised roofs in their time but none more so than Rikki Fulton
and Jack Milroy, two wildly contrasting talents whose partnering was a
stroke of match-making genius. (It was Fulton's idea.)
Who could resist the notion of the layabout Francie McKenzie, born in
a Govanhill tenement after a mis-diagnosis of her condition by his
mother, who was convinced it was just wind! (That tenement,
incidentally, was demolished in Francie's honour.)
Or what about Josie Tierney, found in swaddling clothes outside the
door of a room-and-kitchen in Dennistoun and taken in with 12 bottles of
milk one morning? Naturally, they were destined to hold high office in
the Nyucks Association of Frustrated Flatulence Sufferers (Nyaffs) and
to be honoured with Mickey Mouse watches for 30 years' perfect
attendance at the Coocaddens Labour Exchange.
This theatrical extravaganza of which I write was actually part of a
three-night gala occasion marking the centenary of Scotland's Show
Business Benevolent Fund.
As fund president Johnny Beattie reminded me, show business people
were always good at helping other charities but not so good at looking
after their own futures. So there is a helping hand in their old age,
modest pensions, holidays to Blackpool and so on.
It dates back to the days of popular Glasgow comedian Willie Frame, a
great friend to entertainers who were down on their luck, perhaps
reduced to singing in the street.
Willie led the singing at Springburn Parish Church, appearing as
soloist in The Messiah, and there were kirk folk who frowned on his
flirtation with music hall. But touring Scottish theatres, he would take
to the pulpit and preach the gospel of charity and well-doing.
In the modern setting, his successors, too, were giving their services
free of charge, people like Dorothy Paul, Walter Carr, Peter Morrison,
Geoff Graham, Mary Lee, Anne Fields, Peggy O'Keefe, and Hilary Brooks.
On a night of such unconfined joy, the question uppermost in many a
mind was simply: Why, outwith a charity night, is there no commercial
theatre catering for this kind of audience?
Predictably, I suppose, the answer is money. As the manager of the
King's Theatre, Billy Differ, explained, it costs up to #80,000 a week
to stage a show of that quality. Apart from the stars giving of their
time, there was #12,000 worth of costumes provided free of charge by
Jamie Phillips, the former Glasgow opera singer who now runs his Trends
agency in London. (Appropriately, Jamie himself went on stage and
reminded us of a fine singing voice.)
To finance such a production you need a 90% occupancy of seats -- and
the last time the King's Theatre could count on that kind of support for
variety was in the King's High shows of 1988-89-90. The magnet on those
occasions? None other than Francie and Josie.
Could they be prised out of retirement, even once a year for a week?
In the name of sheer, unadulterated joy, let us hope so.

IT looks as if the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Select
Committee will, later this spring, recommend that Lloyd's of London, the
great insurance market of the City, cease to be self-regulated.
Regulation in financial businesses has multiplied in the past 20 years,
but self-regulation is fast going out of fashion. The fundamental
regulatory force is the law, especially, but not only, company law. It
is the best weapon against wrongdoing in the financial world and it
would be better always if it were improved rather than new jurisdictions
created with specific but limited purposes. Self-regulation is to be
preferred to formal regulation wherever possible if only because it
represents the most flexible and sensitive instrument for protecting
users of services to be regulated. All kinds of regulation tend to act
in a grey area where the legal position is blurred (since, if it were
not, existing law would operate normally) but where activities need some
scrutiny and their users some reassurance. Regulation can spell out
practices which may not be wrong but are certainly foolhardy, and which
may facilitate, if not encourage, wrongdoing.
Regulation cannot automatically ensure the safe and certain delivery
of services and may simply confer a false sense of security and order.
It should be remembered that the various regulatory bodies involved both
here and in Singapore did not prevent the events which preceded the
collapse of Baring's Bank, something noted by many observers. In a
somewhat different area, the regulation of utilities, the latest actions
of the regulator have been extremely contentious, producing remarkable
volatility in markets rather than the stability assumed to be attendant
on regulation. The City in particular needs to think long and hard about
multiplying regulation since part of its success in remaining the
dominant financial centre in the EU stems directly from the way in which
it has managed to be more innovative and flexible than its
over-regulated continental competitors. Too much regulation might simply
divert business elsewhere in an area where the electronic communications
revolution has overturned the facts of geography.
After a long period of sustained prosperity, Lloyd's in the past
decade ran into a succession of failures and scandals. The insurance
business is cyclical, and Lloyd's was very badly bruised at the worst
point in the last cycle. Many individuals have been made bankrupt and
accusations of poor, and even dishonest, practice have been made. The
businesses involved suffered huge losses of capital and have only been
re-capitalised to the extent that they have by ending their
old-established systems based on individual ''names'' and bringing in
corporate finance from new vehicles (notably specialised investment
trusts). Whether this whole new structure requires the imposition of
formal regulation, and the new quango that will involve, needs the
sustained consideration of the House of Commons as a whole, and not just
a Select Committee, no matter how prestigious. Lloyd's is an important
national asset with enormous (export) earning capacity when performing
at its best. Recommendations of a Select Committee carry weight with the
rest of the House, but in this case it will want to be sure that any
recommendations strengthen and not weaken Lloyd's business.

THE transformation of South Africa from a nation riven with injustice
and steeped in hopelessness is an endeavour of the very highest. If all
goes well, South Africa may not just change herself for the better but
may act as a catalyst for the spreading of benefits throughout
sub-Saharan Africa. This is a point which was made with some force in
Glasgow last week by South Africa's energy minister, Mr Pik Botha.
Unfortunately, the perception of change for the better in South Africa
is uneven, and one of the bumpiest parts of all is that associated with
the activities of another minister, Mrs Winnie Mandela. Throughout the
long and bitter years of apartheid Mrs Mandela won admiration for her
courage and her utter determination to go her own way. Those attributes
were suited to the period of opposition, but Mrs Mandela has shown
herself unable to adapt to the new circumstances and it is clear that
her judgment is equally aberrant.
Her pungent criticism of the pace of change in South Africa last month
earned her a rebuke which forced her to write a letter of apology. That
affair could have (and nearly did) result in her sacking, but other
activities have been equally disruptive. Her autocratic behaviour, which
stood her in good stead in the years of persecution, has so infuriated
the board of the African National Congress Women's League that half of
them have resigned. Earlier this month she made a trip to West Africa
after express orders from President Mandela not to go, and her most
recent act of defiance was to refuse to meet Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki to discuss the affair. Other allegations which persist in clinging
to her concern suggestions that she used her position and influence to
win business for a firm in which she had financial interests. Leaving
aside the corruption charges, which may be incapable of proof due to
police bungling, Mrs Mandela's recent activities constitute a sorry tale
of wilfulness and indiscipline. In most other properly run governments a
minister who behaved in this way would have been sacked long ago, indeed
would not have been appointed in the first place. Now it seems clear
that her activities constitute a considerable embarrassment to South
Africa and an affront to its image abroad.
In all of this Mrs Mandela is visibly making calculations. Her
constituency, as a prime township crowd-rouser, is the poor and the
dispossessed of whom South Africa has substantial numbers. Her fiery
rhetoric has always found responses in their own anger and for many of
them she became more of a point of contact with their fears and
aspirations than the older men and women of the ANC who followed the
party line faithfully. Mrs Mandela's calculation is that her support
with the township masses is still sufficiently strong for her to defy
the Government and her estranged husband with impunity. The plain truth
is that now is a time for new calculations to be made, and these are
ones which are appropriate for a new government trying to act in a
responsible way. Mrs Mandela may simply be too much of a cost to bear,
and it is likely that this will be the message which Mr Mbeki will give
President Mandela when the two leaders discuss the affair this week. Mr
Mbeki has also been making calculations. He will have tried to assess
the true depth of support for Mrs Mandela in the country. More
sophisticated analyses suggest that even if her support has held up, the
fact of South Africa's rapidly maturing political system is that the
type of support which Mrs Mandela enjoys is no longer as powerfully
relevant as it once was. Whatever the calculations, and whatever her
past services and undoubted courage, Mrs Mandela now stands more of a
chance of damaging her party and government than of helping it. It is
time for the break to be made.

DEATH, disfigurement, or loss of self-esteem will beckon this year for
nearly 3000 Scotswomen who discover, one way or another, that they have
breast cancer, reports Alan MacDermid. The fear it provokes can lead to
denial -- elderly women will seek help at the last minute with tumours
that have been plain for months -- or it can provoke the anger and
frustration that have fuelled the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign.
This crusade has thrust before the public and the politicians the need
for improvements in treatment, and in support for the patient's
psychological needs.
The implications are not comfortable -- they may mean some district
hospitals abandoning treatment so it can be concentrated in designated
Cancer Units operating on a minimum 100 patients a week, or specialist
centres like the Beatson in Glasgow and the Western General in
Edinburgh.
Screening older women and improvements in treatment have pegged the
death rate, but the incidence of the disease itself has climbed by 12%
over the past 10 years.
Over the next three days we look through the eyes of survivors at the
lottery of who will and who won't get breast cancer, the lottery of
where they are treated and how . . . and the ultimate step some women
will take to beat breast cancer before it starts
Breast cancer is more common among affluent than deprived women
AMONG the plethora of books, articles, and broadcasts which appear
nowadays on health topics, the one called How To Avoid Breast Cancer has
proved to be the most elusive. It seems destined to remain so.
At some time in her life one Scotswoman in 14 will have to cope with
the disease; 1280 die from it every year. What hope is there that this
shadow of fear will be lifted from the lives of half the adult
population?
Not much, in the foreseeable future. Breast cancer is expected to fall
in incidence by only 2% by the year 2000, and that from the 1990 level
of almost 3000 cases. This would require to buck the existing trend -- a
12% increase over the previous 10 years.
How To Survive Breast Cancer is perhaps a more realistic topic, though
no-one has all the answers. In the meantime avoiding it is largely a
matter age and luck or an accident of birth.
These are some of the principal risk factors:
Age -- the disease rises in incidence through the years, from
practically zero up to the age of 20, to nearly 400 per 100,000 by age
85 and over.
Family history, especially mother or other first-degree relative.
No children, or delay in giving birth until beyond age 30.
Early maturity;
Late menopause;
Obesity;
Exposure to radiation.
Less clearly defined factors are:
A high fat diet;
Prolonged use of high dose Hormone Replacement Therapy;
Prolonged use of oral contraception by young women before their first
child;
History of benign breast disease;
Stress.
Breast cancer is also one of the few cancers which is more common
among affluent than deprived women. The highest incidence in Scotland,
85.7 per 100,000, is found in Social Class II (SCI is slightly lower)
whereas it drops to 52.2 per 100,000 in Social Class V.
The likeliest explanation for this is the protective effect of
child-bearing at an early age -- the increased risk may be the price the
successful career woman pays for delaying the start of her family.
Conversely, better-off women have a better chance of surviving it --
just over half compared with just under half of women from deprived
areas.
For whatever reasons middle-class women are more likely to make use of
the health facilities that are on offer -- for example, the uptake for
mammography screening, for example, can vary from 50% to 90%, and this
generally mirrors social class.
Most of the factors listed make a fairly marginal difference -- for
example between 2% and 10% of women with breast cancers have a genetic
abnormality that predisposes them to the disease.
Already it is possible to identify mutations in a gene responsible for
40% of these inherited breast cancers, and others are expected to
follow. Carriers of this gene will have an 80%-85% risk of developing
the disease in their lifetime; however if you have passed the age at
which other relatives were affected, the chances are you have not
inherited this mutation and are at no greater risk than anyone else.
Earlier onset of maturity, and delayed menopause, are outwith the
control of the individual. Diet may make some difference, since obesity
is a risk factor and there is evidence that a high-fat Western diet also
contributes. The phenomenon cited for this is the fate of women from
Japan -- where the disease is rare -- emigrating to America and reaching
the same level as the locals in two or three generations.
Generally, however, breast cancer is sporadic and avoiding it is
largely a matter of luck; the more realistic question is not how to
avoid it, but how to survive it.
The fact that so much depends on clinical intervention -- and the
complicated factors involved in deciding what form that intervention
should take -- has provoked current demands for women with the disease
to be treated at specialist units or centres.
The first priority is to catch the disease early, hence the setting-up
of the breast screening service, whose seven Scottish centres opened
between 1988 and 1991. Apart from mishaps like the procedural error
admitted by the Dundee centre two weeks ago which led to an abnormal
diagnosis not being followed up, the issues surrounding the screening
service relate to the extent of its coverage.
Women aged 50-64 are routinely invited for a mammogram every three
years. Up to 40% of deaths in this age group could be prevented by
screening, but since uptake is patchy -- about 71% overall -- the target
is a 25% reduction in mortality, or more than 100 lives saved every
year.
But this amounts to a decrease of only 8% overall. Younger women are
left to wonder why they are not included. Breast cancer in younger women
is thought to be harder to detect at an early stage through mamography.
Similar arguments apply to the question of a shorter interval between
screening, and both are under examination.
Apart from the economic implications, the efficiency of the
radiologists who read the mammograms is thought to be at risk if they
are not seeing at least five abnormalities per thousand patients. They
would spend more time looking for smaller and smaller tumours.
But why not older women, who are most at risk of all?
''That decision was taken on the basis of a number of trials before
the 1986 Forrest Report which recommended a national screening
service,'' said Dr Alastair Kirkpatrick, Director of the South-east
Scotland service. ''A smaller and smaller yield from inviting over-65s
was observed, so they decided to stop inviting them.
''As a result you'll get a woman of 67 who thinks breast cancer isn't
going to happen to her. In fact it rises exponentially with age. One of
the things we would like to get across is that the service is available
for women over 65, even though they won't be specifically invited.''
Younger women who have a family history, or who discover a lump
through self-examination, will receive a mammogram as part of the
diagnostic procedure.
Outright prevention remains focused on the influence of reproductive
hormones -- the reason why early maturity, late menopause, and delayed
childbirth increase the risk of breast cancer.
The nearest medical science has come to an antidote for this effect is
tamoxifen, a drug now well-established as an adjunct to other treatment
where cancer has already occurred. It is now under clinical trial as a
prophylactic treatment for healthy women who are at high risk of breast
cancer, but wider use may be inhibited by fear of side-effects,
including disturbances of the lining of the womb.
'It should not
be a lottery'
ALWYN Carmichael, 56, was treated with a combination of radiotherapy
and drugs, and now continues to receive the hormone drug tamoxifen,
after discovering through self-examination that she had breast cancer.
''I found a large lump in 1991 and was referred to the breast unit at
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, then to Longmore Hospital (now closed and
replaced by the Longmore Unit at the Western General Hospital).
''On the first visit to Edinburgh Royal I was told that I had a
malignant tumour. They did a needle aspiration.
''At the Longmore treatment was decided after an ECG and a bone scan.
''Because of the stage of my tumour, a T4, radiotherapy was
prescribed. I had a very big tumour, 6.5cms by 7cms, which had travelled
to my clavicle, and they had to reduce it in size before they could
operate but when they were finished it was clear I didn't need surgery.
''I had six weeks of total radiotherapy at the end of 1991 and then a
course of radium implants.
''I am still on tamoxifen and Zoladex, an oestrogen suppressant which
because of may age -- I am 56 -- they gave me as an alternative to
removing my ovaries since they would soon be packing up anyway.
''The needles were more uncomfortable than painful -- I had 15 at the
one time going through from one side to the other. They put thin tubes
through first of all, under local anaesthetic, then they put the needles
through the tubes.
''They were in for 48 hours. Because I was radioactive I was kept in a
room by myself, with all facilities en suite. Visitors were each allowed
in for only 20 minutes a day, and the nurses would come in and out very
quickly.
''They checked for radioactivity before I left but after the needles
are removed it falls very quickly to negligible levels.
''But I suffered after-effects.
''Total radiotherapy involves lying on a couch while the co-ordinates
are filed on the computer. You go back to the same position every day
and the machine moves round the bed.
''This went on every day for six weeks -- I carried on working in the
morning and went in in the afternoon -- then there was a month's break
before the needles. The tiredness really hit me after that.
''It was 18 months in all before they could say there were no cancer
cells left. I had been having ultrasound scans which showed the tumour
reducing.
''You have to be very patient, but at the end of the 18 months it was
absolutely fantastic.
''One of the things that led me to examine myself was that I thought I
had a bruise. I felt around it and realised it was a lump. I was told
the cancer was coming through the skin. That disappeared very quickly
after the treatment started but it had drawn my attention to the fact
that something was wrong.
''I had had a mammogram a year before. It was clear but I am a great
believer in self-examination. I have heard of several other women who
have found their lumps themselves. It is so worthwhile. Young women can
learn to to do it -- it is all they can do, unless there is a family
history to alert them.
''How you get on depends a lot on where you live. I am very lucky to
live in the Edinburgh area. It was not just a question of cutting off
the breast. What I was given is the standard treatment for my type of
tumour.
''I am very lucky -- this is why we are campaigning, to get more
specialist units. It should not be a lottery.
We have already treated 35 patients with advanced disease, and had no
deaths
Cost of
survival
SCOTS breast cancer patients are among women being selected to try out
a new treatment where the odds of dying from the disease are being
weighed against the risk of dying from the treatment.
The Western General Hospital in Edinburgh and the Beatson Oncology
Centre in Glasgow are aiming the controversial new treatment at women
who are likely to be living on borrowed time because of the spread of
the disease to the rest of their body.
Treatment of breast cancer is based on a choice of, or combination of,
surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy embraces a range of cytotoxic drugs. They are extremely
effective at killing cancer cells; their limitation is they are harmful
to healthy cells, too, including the stem cells in the bone marrow which
manufacture blood cells. If they can be taken out of the picture while
the chemotherapy is being given, much higher doses are possible.
After an initial dose of chemotherapy the patient is given growth
factor to enhance stem cell growth in the blood, which is then
progressively extracted to have the stem cells removed.
They are put in a freezer while the enhanced doses of chemotherapy are
applied, and replaced later.
Dr Robert Leonard, a consultant oncologist at the Western General who
is helping to pioneer the treatment in the UK, said: ''There are risks
that the patients will pick up an infection in the meantime, which would
be severe, and there are risks from the high-dose chemotherapy. They can
damage other organs.
''We are allowing for a mortality from the procedure of 3%, but we
hope to see an improvement in overall survival. The average survival
without the treatment would be six months to a year, which isn't much.
''We have already treated 35 patients with advanced disease, and had
no deaths.''
Ten of his patients will be women with advanced disease, which can be
plainly seen under X-ray, and 10 will be in the high-risk category,
where the secondary cancers are not overt but are assumed to be
developing.
''Advanced disease is harder to deal with, but I still feel the
situation is so bad for young people with advanced disease that we
should be trying to do something for them.''
The treatment is still controversial, not only because of the risk but
because of the cost.
''The economic argument is that out of 10 you might only save one, at
enormous cost,'' said Dr Leonard. ''Our costings are estimated at
#15,000-#20,000 for the procedure, and that includes everything down to
bed occupancy. From that you can deduct the cost of treating advanced
breast cancer anyway. But it could all hinge on how many patients we
save.''
Existing choices of treatment will depend on the type of tumour, how
big it is, whether it has or may have broken out and spread to other
parts of the body, and the age and general health of the patient.
Surgery can take the traditional form, mastecomy or removal of the
breast, or conservation surgery, where the affected lump or a segment is
removed, with the addition of systemic treatment (radotherapy or
chemotherapy).
A mastectomy may be performed as a matter of patient preference, where
the tumour is too large to leave a satisfactory result through
conservative treatment, or where there are several cancer sites within
the breast.
If the cancer is extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be applied
beforehand to shrink the tumour to an operable size.
Follow-up systemic treatment is applied to prevent recurrence in the
event of some cancer cells having been left behind, or to treat cancer
cells which may have migrated to other parts of the body (metastases)
which are the most dangerous consequence of breast cancer.
Radiotherapy may be applied by machine -- the patient lies on a couch,
the machine is ''aimed'' at the tumour area, and the co-ordinates
entered into a computer. This means the treatment can be repeated
accurately day after day. Older techniques have been associated with
damage to the heart and lungs.
Alternatively, or additionally, the radiation may be delivered by
radioactive needles which are inserted through the breast after surgery
and left in place over a day or two.

COASTGUARD Ian Stephen did more than help save lives, he wrote about
the dramatic rescues.
And now the man hailed as one of Scotland's leading poets has quit his
job as a senior watch officer at Stornoway to become a full-time writer,
ending his 15-year association with the service which gave him endless
inspiration for his poetry.
Among the countless incidents that left their mark on the 39-year-old
Lewis-born writer was the week-long search for the crew of the German
trawler Frank C. Only one survivor was found drifting in a liferaft near
Rockall.
Mr Stephen's work has grown in acclaim since his poetry was first
published in 1980. He has had six books of poems and a collection of
short stories published.
He has now left for a two-month writing residency in France -- the
result of being the first winner of the Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial
Award, part sponsored by the Scottish Arts Council.
''It was a difficult decision for me to leave my job. Being a writer
is a very marginal existence.
''I think my colleagues were very surprised when I handed in my
notice. But the work I did with the service will reappear in my poetry,
prose, and other writing. It will always stay with me,'' he said.

Bruce McKain, Law Correspondent, examines the latest edition of a book
which journalists ignore at their peril
THERE are few certainties about the law, except that it rarely stands
still and becomes increasingly complex. The axiom that everyone must be
presumed to know the law and that ignorance is no excuse for breaking it
grows more unrealistic by the day -- for lawyers as well as the rest of
us.
Nowhere is that more true than in the area of media law which
essentially tries to hold the delicate balance between the people's
right to know what is being done in their name and competing interests
such as the right to a fair trial and not to be defamed.
Recent events illustrate that in some areas, the law -- or those who
operate it -- have failed lamentably to maintain that balance. The
reporting of the case of Fred and Rosemary West is a prime example of
the media in England literally treating the right to a fair trial with
contempt, and being allowed by the Attorney-General to get away with it.
In Scotland, editors would have been instructed to turn up with a
toothbrush and a small overnight bag had they published similar stories
pending a trial here. Yet, the contempt of court legislation governing
the two jurisdictions is exactly the same.
Again in England, the pendulum in libel cases has swung dangerously in
favour of hypersensitive souls who have been awarded obscenely high
damages by juries for the most trivial of slights.
Since we live in the real world we have to deal with the law as it is,
not as we would like it to be, and that is one of the reasons for the
sixth edition of a book called Scots Law for Journalists.
By a happy coincidence, it is exactly 30 years since George Watt, The
Herald's former Court of Session Correspondent, and Dr Eric Clive, now a
full-time member of the Scottish Law Commission, produced Scots Law I.
The law has changed a great deal since then, and not always for the
better. Even since the last edition of the book in 1988 wide-ranging
developments in media law made an update essential if not overdue. Apart
from the endless ramifications of defamation and contempt of court, new
laws have been introduced to deal with Official Secrets and Copyright.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, has led the way in the UK by allowing
television cameras into our courts, making essential the introduction of
new rules to prevent the legal process degenerating into soap opera.
In his first involvement with the book, Alistair Bonnington, the BBC's
legal adviser in Scotland, has broadened its scope by explaining the
rules and complexities of broadcasting law.
The book also examines the issue of privacy. The media is still
haunted by the threat of new laws to prevent intrusion into private
lives, a threat which essentially harks back to an ''interview'' by the
Sunday Sport with 'Allo 'Allo actor Gorden Kaye as he lay gravely ill in
a hospital bed.
But the ruling classes, including the royal family, have now shot
themselves so often in the foot -- and possibly other parts of their
anatomy -- over the privacy issue that we are still awaiting legislation
in a state of complete uncertainty.
Perhaps the fact that David Mellor was the Government Minister who
originally warned the media that they were drinking in the last-chance
saloon, says it all. Cheers, David.
The aim of the book is to help journalists do their job better and
more safely in the public interest. They can do that only if they are
fully aware of their rights and, just as importantly, their
responsibilities.
When you are reporting a court case what documents are you allowed to
look at? Can you use information that was not read out in open court? Is
there any law in Scotland to prevent you naming the victim in a rape
case? (No, but we don't anyway). Can you use pictures of parents
allegedly involved in a child sex abuse case? When can a court sit in
secret session?
The book attempts to guide journalists through the legal minefield by
answering these and similar questions, but always with the emphasis that
the journalist should be acting in the public interest.
Perhaps no-one has expressed the point better than Lord Emslie, the
former Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice General
of Scotland, who once wrote a foreword for the book.
''If the public is to retain confidence in the judicial process I have
no doubt that it must be kept aware of what the courts are doing and why
they have reached decisions which affect the lives and the liberty of
people in this country.
''In the nature of things, few members of the public attend trials and
other court hearings, and we have come to rely on court reporters, in
the public interest, to provide an essential link betweeen the courts
and the people whom they exist to serve.
''If journalists are to discharge this vital role in our society, they
must, of course, be informed observers of the events which they record,
and their reports, if they are to serve a useful purpose, must,
notwithstanding the many pitfalls which lie in wait for the unwary and
the unskilled, be accurate, balanced and sensitive.
''The great virtue of this book is that it provides for journalists
generally, and for court reporters in particular, thoroughly sound
instruction in the legal system in Scotland and the best possible advice
on how to set about the task with knowledge.''
The final judgment on whether the new edition approaches that standard
must be left to the readers.
* Scots Law for Journalists is published by W Green, #19.95.

<HEADLINE>Scots beaches threatened by 'imported' litter</HEADLINE>

AS much as one third of the litter polluting Scotland's beaches is
''imported'' from across the Atlantic, according to a new report.
Research by the Tidy Britain Group has revealed two-thirds of rubbish
comes from the UK and Northern Europe, but the rest is washed up from as
far away as Canada and North America.
Litter from Canada and North America has increased four-fold over the
past decade and, according to the group, can be blamed on the continued
dumping of municipal waste in remote regions of Newfoundland.
The independent charity's director general, Professor Graham Ashworth,
said: ''The money spent by UK authorities on cleaning up water and
beaches will be wasted if we still get a significant proportion of
plastic and sewage-related litter being 'imported' from Canada and North
America.''
The group's findings are based on detailed surveys carried out on 63
beaches around the Scottish shoreline, and are mirrored in England and
Wales. The Department of the Environment will be asked to examine the
damning dossier and recommend Government action.
Ms Aileen McWey, for the group, said last night: ''Our marine
researcher, Mr Trevor Dixon, has amassed most of his information from
surveys carried out along the West Coast of Scotland and the Western
Isles over the last 10 years. Our report is primarily based on our
Scottish studies.''
Despite almost 70 pieces of international legislation designed to
protect the marine environment, the survey shows:
* Marine litter has risen by 40% on Scottish beaches over the last
decade.
* Plastic waste is up 20%, with glass and metal container waste
dropping by 10% and 15% respectively.
* Most plastic waste found intact was less than three years old,
although one plastic container was more than 30 years old.
* Sewage-related litter has risen 10%, with some traced to North
American sources.
Professor Ashworth said: ''This is the most detailed research of its
kind carried out anywhere in the world. We have known for some time that
marine litter is a problem around the shores of the UK, and legislation
has been introduced to deal with the problem.
''Our research has shown that, while legislation is adequate, it is
difficult to enforce. We are proposing a broader approach where everyone
involved, such as fishermen, port and harbour authorities, and other
interested bodies must be encouraged to share the responsibility for the
disposal of waste.''
On a lighter note, the report's author is baffled by the ''apparent
prevalence of one-legged sailors''. It seems more right shoes than left
are lost at sea, with rights outnumbering lefts two to one.

Marcella Evaristi drops into the Red Light Zone to witness a poor
performance of pique by a policewoman turned would-be actress
IT IS Saturday night, and I am home alone, content to be cuddled up
while youngsters out there are partying and snogging: I am watching the
Red Light Zone, which everyone in the world must know by know is Channel
4's exploration of sex, sexuality, brothels and bedstuff from every
angle.
While hailing its own impeccable credentials (female producers, adult
cultural commentary, non-titilation exploration of the G-spot where big
business bumps and grinds with the libido), the trailers are all heavy
breathing and ''let me show you a good time, viewers''.' Having it both
ways, as it were.
The hypocrisy is not even irritating, because it is such an obvious
sell, and let's face it, there is a larger hypocrisy in the world out
there. We seem not to have progessed very far in our attitudes to
sexuality; look at the treatment of homosexuality by the church and
state, the farce of back to basics and family values which even
two-faced Toryism had to ditch. I cannot think of a European country
with the equivalent of the Mary Whitehouse phenomenon, as English as
John Major's pathetic Little England vision of cricket and village
greens and (sorry) crumpets.
It is difficult to write on this subject without all these double
entendres cropping up. The giggle-giggle, nudge-nudge factor can be
eradicated when considering sexuality, of course, but there is always
going to be that connection between intellectual analysis and the
personal erotic experience. Fantasy rarely shares the same bed as
political correctness.
No wonder the would-be faithful believer can be trapped by the
Christian stricture: you don't actually have to screw your neighbour's
wife, just thinking about it, committing adultery in your heart, is
sinful. Youngsters were (perhaps still are) advised to pray to the
Virgin Mary if they were plagued by unchaste thoughts. Which is a bit
much if you think about it: like asking a Jehovah's Witness to help you
with your Oscar Wilde essay.
Police Officer Carol Shaya, got the sack, no, lost her job, for baring
all for Playboy magazine. She still kept bits of her uniform on -- the
leathery bits mostly. The fact of her being a police officer was part of
the turn-on.
I've never really understood about uniforms. I must be uniform-frigid.
I bet there's a self-help group in America I could go to. Maybe it has
to do with my having worn one from age 5-16. I know men (excuse me, some
men) have a thing about gymslips, and I wish I'd been party to that
information earlier. But the word ''uniform'' conjures up unluscious
images of brown woolly gloves dangling on elastic from my sleeves,
unerotic stripy ties, and cardigans covered in little brown baubly bits.
I have never had the desire to rip off a policeman's uniform with my
teeth, and the last time I stared at a soldier's gear was years ago on a
London tube. The boy was about 18 and talking proudly about going to
Northern Ireland, nothing stirred except depression.
Anyway, there was Carol, her lip gloss obviously applied with a
truncheon, her hair flowing Barbie-like to the waist, pouting her
grievances to the camera.
It just wasn't fair, and here's why. The body is a thing of beauty to
be shared. Playboy is not trashy, it's not like I posed for a tacky
magazine, I mean lots of clever people read and write for Playboy. And
what I do in my own time is my own business.
I try to decide if I agreed as my mind went blank for a bit. I tried
to pull my liberal sense of justice together, like a sensible cardigan;
trying to put myself in the position of a policewoman is not something
that comes easily to me, but I could concede that it is pretty insulting
to women to have their working image trashed in this way. Like a woman
painter being asked to straddle her easel for a publicity photo.
Shaya was not being discriminated against for, say, being gay, or even
working as a stripper on her nights off: she was happily exploiting her
profession. She was adoring the ensuing publicity and it was blatantly
obvious that she did not want a reversal of the decision. The offers
were flowing in, officer. This was not a woman publicising an injustice,
but a would-be actress giving a bad performance of pique.
No, I would keep my sympathy, which Carol Shaya certainly does not
need, for the agonising past of crimewriter James Ellroy, the subject of
the documentary White Jazz. His mother was strangled when he was ten and
his father died later that year. Booze, drugs and downhill it was after
that. Then he got his act together and is now one of America's most
lauded writers of crime fiction. Now his performance I believed.

James Freeman considers whether we are asking too much of the police
when they have to pick up the pieces for social service failures, such
as coping with the mentally ill, as well as maintaining law and order
THE incisive criticism levelled by Dr Derek Chiswick yesterday over
the lack of clear policy for dealing with mentally disturbed offenders
in Scotland has strong resonances for the police service.
In terms of Strathclyde Police, when forensic psychiatrist Dr Chiswick
said that mentally disordered offenders came to public attention only at
times of disaster he was getting very close to home.
Last summer a Glasgow police officer died in the street after
attempting to arrest a young man who had gone berserk with a kitchen
knife. The young man's mother, unable to get help from the medical
authorities, had called the police.
Six months later, again in Glasgow, a 20-stone recluse died as he
struggled violently with a police officer in his parents' home. The man
himself had made the 999 call which brought the police.
Both tragedies have a common link -- schizophrenia. They highlighted a
growing problem which has overtaken the police service. While willing to
address yet another of society's ills, the police have a considerable
distance to go in terms of training for officers forced to confront an
increasing number of the mentally ill.
At a time when chief constables cannot find resources to carry out
their core functions, should we continue to regard the police as the
only 24-hour community service to deal with the mentally ill? The
alternative, one urged by the police themselves, is that proper medical
safety nets be put in place.
Meantime, a start has been made by the police service to come to grips
with what is essentially the fall-out from the Government's Care in the
Community policy, but the response has been patchy. In some areas
charities involved with the mentally ill are forming relationships with
individual community police officers and and their is a new information
video tape produced by the Metropolitan Police in conjunction with some
English charities. It constitutes a faltering start but not much more.
Here in Scotland, the police response appears to be that there is
already a well-designed element of conflict resolution in basic
training. The question increasingly being asked is whether this is
enough. The thrust of the training is towards resolving, without force,
the kind of disorder in the home, on the streets, and in pubs which is a
commonplace in Scottish society. If there is any impetus at chief
officer level in Scotland to tackle the problems posed by the mentally
ill there is a reluctance to talk about it.
In both the Glasgow cases -- and there have many more which have not
hit the headlines -- confrontation arose when the police were called to
handle an emergency. In neither case did the officers who responded
appear to be aware that the key to the crisis was mental illness, and
specifically schizophrenia. It is difficult, therefore, to blame them
for responding according to their training and culture.
Ordinary patrol and station officers have always had to deal with a
percentage of the mentally ill, from the local character hearing voices
telling him to jump off a bridge to the lady who gets messages from God.
But these people, like the majority of the mentally ill, are non-violent
and if a danger to anyone usually only to themselves.
The new element, the schizophrenic wandering the street out of reach
of medical care -- very often having abandoned prescribed medication --
is a more serious proposition. Major psychiatric hospitals are either
being run down or are set to close here in Scotland very soon.
Ian Harper, of the National Schizophrenic Fellowship in Scotland, puts
the number of mentally ill people who come into contact with the police
in any year in Scotland at about 5000. It is realistic to assume that
that figure will rise, and in England it is estimated that there have
been 35 murders attributable to schizophrenics who have been released
from hospitals into society since Care in the Community began.
One of the few police research projects so far undertaken into police
attitudes on contact with the mentally disordered, is by a
well-qualified WPC from Gwent, Karen Cherrett. The paper has gained her
some celebrity, probably, she agrees, because of the paucity of material
in the field.
She says: ''Officers have been injured because they were unable to
read the warning signs. People's behaviour perhaps started as being
nothing more than slightly bizarre, yet the uniform and the
paraphernalia, such as buzzing radios, handcuffs and batons, have led to
violent reaction. With the mentally disturbed, behaviour which was never
intended to be violent can be misread as violence.''
She says that in England and Wales the subject has largely been left
to individual officers. Formal training has been sparse, an hour or so
on police powers on the mentally ill, which may be followed up later in
some forces with a lecture by social service carers or local charities.
WPC Cherret puts some of the problems down to police culture.
''Police are used to taking charge of a scene with people doing what
they say. But we know that schizophrenics will often react badly to that
level of control. You immediately have a conflict between the police
approach and that of the mental health carer which would have been more
subtle.
''The carer would not crowd the schizophrenic, who will have a thing
about personal space, who will need time and room to breathe and react.
Police often go around in twos, so their physical presence compounds the
problem. Accustomed to a different approach, that of the carer, the
schizophrenic reacts defensively, adding to the likelihood of
violence.''
Fife Constabulary have developed a multi-agency approach to
interviewing those with learning difficulties -- the mentally
handicapped -- whether as accused, witness or as a victim, which
involves calling a ''responsible adult'' -- a qualified helper -- to be
present to assist, and this has been assessed by the Scottish Office and
disseminated as best practice by all Scottish forces. Deputy Chief
Constable Graham Bennett of Fife points out the key difficulty for the
police. ''The medical profession have grave problems identifying some of
the mental illnesses, including schizophrenia. I would not expect the
police ever to be professionally competent to identify and deal with all
types of illness. What I am trying to do is to improve the quality of
service to everyone involved, including the person who is ill and the
officer.''
Ian Harper of NFS Scotland adds: ''There is an assumption in police
work that with basic training they can sort out all sorts of problems
that all sorts of people have. But that does not fully address the
problem of specific illnesses. They require more specific training.''
The police agree, he says, that a large part of their workload
involves dealing with the mentally ill and recent statistics have shown
that more and more people ending up in prison suffer from mental
illnesses.
''This,'' he states, ''is not a peripheral issue. It can't be swept
under the carpet.''
Matthew Larkin, of the National Schizophrenic Fellowship in England,
identifies a series of simple training moves which the police could
address quickly, again in the realm of the calm and non-threatening
approach. But, he says, their contact with the police hierarchy has
shown it to be slow, convoluted and committee-bound, and they cannot
gain a foothold to assist with training officers.
The Metropolitan Police, he believes, are very aware of the problem
because they face the greatest difficulties. Their training video, which
includes schizophrenics talking about their illness and their
experiences with the police, is very helpful.
''There is a movement at high level to have special training for
custody officers who are important figures in all this. They most often
have to hold mentally ill people in cells until their condition can be
properly assessed. The NSF would welcome input into this.
''It is now obvious that there is a pressing need for a proper
approach to training for the police. When police training courses were
devised most people suffering from schizophrenia were safely in
hospital. That is no longer the case and the only service which can
guarantee a 24-hour presence, 365 days a year, is the police.
''Many of the problems arising are due to other services not working
properly; too many hospital beds being cut too soon, for example. Do you
train the police to cope with the failings of other services or do you
aim for some point where every other service is functioning as it should
be so that the police are not required? I do not know if the police want
to be in a position where they pick up the pieces for services,'' he
says.
Despite the problems, Ian Harper believes, the daily experience of
many schizophrenics with the police is not unhappy, not negative. Many
have used the police to get help and treatment when others have turned
their back on them, and increasingly, with the rolling closure of the
Victorian asylums and the release of the mentally ill, their role as a
super social service is in the spotlight.

ROBBIE the Pict yesterday announced he was setting up a splinter group
of the Clan Donnachaidh, the clan of the Robertsons, as the latest move
in his long-running and colourful campaign for Scottish independence.
Robbie, also known as Brian Robertson, 47, is taking the step after
asking clan chief Gilbert Robertson of Struan, who farms in Kent,
whether he planned to get involved in the self-rule movement.
''The topic was raised because, as the descendants of Bethoc, daughter
of King Duncan, we are the oldest clan in Scotland and carry the royal
line,'' the bearded campaigner said.
''Should the Stewarts fail Scotland, it is traditionally the
responsibility of the Robertsons to pick up the sovereign standard. The
Robertson clan crest depicts a fist upholding the imperial crown of
Scotland and, with this in mind, I asked the Robertson of Struan if he
had any intention of becoming involved in the current movement or of
giving an indication of where his sympathies lay.
''He replied that he felt that it was inappropriate for a clan chief
to become embroiled in politics.
''I therefore advised him that I intended to fulfil our clan
responsibilities and would attempt to mobilise those clan members who
were in favour of restoring Scotland's right to sovereign
self-determination.''
The ''splinter sept'' of the clan would be active in the pursuit of
the restoration of Scottish independence.
''I raise the fiery cross worldwide and invite all like-minded
Robertsons and their kin, along with the people of Scotland without a
formal clan but whose hearts lie in Scotland, to contact the new Clan
Robertson Centre at Auchraw House, Lochearnhead, Perthshire.''
He hoped other clans would consider backing the campaign for
independence.
Asked whether he had any hopes of persuading fellow clansmen such as
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, or Mr Raymond
Robertson, the Conservative MP for Aberdeen South, to back the cause of
an independent Scotland, Robbie replied: ''I would give them one chance,
but I suspect they are betrothed to their party masters.''
Turning to the Stewart clan, he singled out Mr Allan Stewart, MP for
Eastwood and, until recently, a Scottish Office Minister. He claimed
that Mr Stewart had ''betrayed'' the sovereignty of Scotland by virtue
of his membership of the Conservative Party, which was ''dedicated to
imperial control of Scotland as a colony''.
He emphasised that by ''mobilising'' clansmen, he did not mean to
imply any kind of violence, and ''utterly condemned'' the sending of
letter-bombs to Labour Party figures at the weekend, reportedly the work
of Scottish self-rule extremists.
''There is no need for violent action. This is a civilised age. This
is the age of communication. Violent action is stupid.''
So what kind of initiatives did he envisage the clan getting involved
in to advance the cause of independence? ''I think there should be
relations opened clearly between the United Nations and the people of
Scotland.
''There is no voice of authority of the Scottish people, we have to
find our voice by communicating internationally with the UN and the
powers of Europe and telling them we are a kingdom and we are
resurrecting ourselves.
''We should develop cultural links as widely as possible. There are
many millions of Scots living around the world. We are well liked and
well respected, and we should take advantage of that.''
The clan chief last night said of Robbie's plan: ''You can't create a
sept of the clan like that, it is not technically possible. But
obviously any member of the clan who may wish to support him is
perfectly free to do so.'' Asked if he thought many would, he replied:
''I have no idea.''
On the question of Scottish self-rule, he said: ''I am not involved in
politics and I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment.''

<TEXT>
THE daughters of the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn may become involved
in a legal wrangle over his estate with his second wife Sam -- just
three weeks after his death.
At stake is Fordell Castle, the magnificent 13th century keep rescued
from ruin by the former Solicitor General for Scotland, and left to Lady
Fairbairn. Bought for #100, it is now worth close to #1m, and is
understood to comprise the bulk of Sir Nicholas's estate. His body lies
in a crypt in the grounds.
But Fordell may have to be sold to meet the daughters' claims.
Charlotte, 31, Sir Nicholas's middle daughter and mother of his only
grandchild, six-month-old Jake, confirmed the possibility, but added:
''But then it may well be sold anyway.''
Speaking at her country house in the Lake District, Charlotte, married
to composer Ross Pople, said: ''I'm shocked that this is known. We don't
want it to come to court.
''My solicitor is preparing a letter to Sam to try to get some sort of
settlement to avoid all that.
''We want to do this with dignity.''
She refused to detail exactly what the sisters' claim on the estate
would be after phoning her solicitor. But she admitted: ''Yes, Fordell
may have to be sold. We don't know exactly what the estate is.''
Sir Nicholas, was understood not to be ''cash rich,'' although it is
believed the girls were left a small cash legacy. Fordell has only
several acres . . . the bulk of the original estate is split between
many owners. Although it is beautifully furnished, few of the pieces
would make real money on the open market.
Sir Nicholas always maintained he bought the castle and denied
suggestions that it was a wedding present to him and his first wife.
Charlotte, Anna-Karina, and Francesca are Sir Nicholas' only children
from his first marriage to the Hon Elizabeth Mackay, daughter of Lord
Reay. He described them as his ''little women'' in his autobiography
calling their childhood in Fordell idyllic. Their mother said last
night: ''I have no wish to comment on my daughters' actions.''
Sir Nicholas married Sam, now 53, 12 years ago. She had a son, Callum,
from her previous marriage. Lady Fairbairn, distressed and exhausted,
has been confined to bed on doctor's orders. A family friend said: ''The
last weeks of Nicky's life took an awful lot out of her. Now this from
the girls has just floored her.
''She has to cope with grief and the possible loss of her home.''
Last year Sam hosted a party for Sir Nicholas's 60th birthday and
Charlotte's 30th at Fordell. The friend added:''She couldn't have been
kinder to the girls.''
Solicitor Adrian Ward confirmed that he was acting on behalf of all
three daughters in relation to the administration of the estate. He
said: ''They have consulted me with regard to their position. They
simply wish to see that matters are handled fairly and amicably.
''It is sad that things have to be addressed, but this is not an
agressive or confrontational action by the daughters. These are acutely
private and confidential matters concerning the family only. Discussion
between the lawyers are continuing.''
In London, Francesca said: ''I really can't say anything, because I
might say something I will regret.''
Solicitors representing Lady Fairbairn said the executors of the will
did not want to comment.
Over the past few years, Lady Fairbairn has made Fordell pay for
itself. The roof was restored largely due to ''paying guests'' from
America and Russia who would be given a tour of the keep followed by a
lavish lunch. The couple both adored the castle. Sir Nicholas once
wrote: ''For me, my castle is my home, but, more, it is the very
expression of my soul within and without.''

THE future of the #200m shopping mall proposed for Buchanan Street in
Glasgow has still not been secured, it emerged yesterday.
The John Lewis Partnership has not signed a contractual agreement with
the developers. It is understood it will not sign until a construction
schedule has been completed, and that won't be done until planning
permission -- which will be applied for within one month -- is granted.
John Lewis started fears that it had lost interest in the huge project
when it failed to mention it in a round-up of new store developments
announced at its annual report meeting last week.
When pressed a company spokesman said it was looking at ''a number of
sites'' in Glasgow and revealed that nothing had been signed in relation
to the Buchanan Street Centre.
A spokesman said on Friday: ''Nothing is definite, but it is a very
attractive site and we want to be in Glasgow. We have expressed a public
interest in this project.''
However, it is known that John Lewis has taken part in talks between
the developers and Glasgow District Council over the planning
application.
The latest meeting, on Friday, involved Glasgow's council leader Pat
Lally. It is understood problems have been ironed out and the
application will be recommended for approval.
Nobody could be contacted for comment from the developers the Buchanan
Centre Partnership.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Homes to invest #36m</HEADLINE>

THE housing agency, Scottish Homes, is to invest #36m in the Highlands
and Islands and Grampian over the coming financial year, and it expects
to generate a further #17m of investment from the private sector.
It will grant #30.8m to housing associations, co-operatives, private
developers, and individuals, and spend #5.1m on the repair and
maintenance of houses which remain in its ownership.
It will spend around #20m on housing developments already under
construction, or which have been recently approved, and more than #10m
will be set aside for new contracts and land acquisitions approved
during the year.
''We have close working relationships with our strategic partners --
the local, island and regional authorities, area health boards, local
enterprise companies and the private sector,'' said Mr Stuart Nichol,
Scottish Homes district manager for the Highlands, Islands, and
Grampian.
''Building on the network of joint investment plans and joint
initiatives already in place, we are considerably improving our
knowledge of local housing markets, helping to ensure that investment is
targeted to the people and the areas of greatest need.
''New investment for 1995/96 will provide a start for around 835 new
or improved homes -- building on the high number of homes started last
year.
''The new programme also gives priority to developing a supply of land
to meet future house-building requirements.
''Another priority will be to ensure that housing and economic
investment is linked and we will extend our partnership arrangements
with the Local Enterprise Companies.''
Almost 340 homes will be created for rent through housing
associations, co-operatives and private landlords. Another 500 houses
will be made available for owner occupation through grants for low-cost
home-ownership, and shared-ownership schemes and direct grants to enable
individuals to build their own homes in rural areas.
Mr Nichol said that Scottish Homes would maintain its commitment to
the Aberdeen City Centre Partnership where a planned #66.5m investment
is expected to generate a further #3m from the private sector.
Two-thirds of the total investment will assist home-ownership
initiatives, through private developers and housing associations, and
the balance will help provide rented homes through housing associations
and co-operatives.
Scottish Homes will also participate in a new multi-agency scheme for
Wick which aims to regenerate the town centre with a new housing and
commercial development.
More than #24m will be used to improve rural housing conditions and
increase the supply and widen the choice of housing to help sustain
rural communities.
Mr Nichol said that the agency planned substantial investment to bring
empty properties back into use, to help alleviate homelessness, and
around 140 homes would be provided for those with special housing needs
through local community care schemes.

LABOUR front bencher John McFall has accused the Scottish Landowners
Federation of prejudice and feudalism, and of threatening what he
claimed were improving relations between Labour and the owners of 36% of
Scotland.
His anger was prompted by an SLF briefing paper on Mr McFall's
anti-foxhunting Bill, which states: ''The Scottish Landowners Federation
regards this Bill as being an unreasonable attempt by those who do not
understand the countryside to impose their prejudices on others.''
He has written to the SLF, warning that the ''prejudiced tone'' of the
briefing is contrary to the organisation's expressed wish for dialogue
with all political parties.
Mr McFall says he has worked closely with the SLF on other issues,
notably Loch Lomond, and asked: ''Are they interested in constructive
dialogue with the entire political spectrum in Parliament, or are they
just confining themselves to a narrow group?
''A group which has approached me in the past and worked with me on
Loch Lomond now appears to be extremely short-sighted. There are echoes
of feudalism here.''
Mr Simon Fraser, director of the SLF, rejected any suggestion of
elitism or snobbery. ''I'm sorry he feels that way,'' he said. ''There's
no question of elitism or snobbism in this. We are speaking as country
people, not as lairds.
''But we do feel that people who perhaps are a bit more removed from
nature don't necessarily understand that nature is a rougher place than
the package life we have in towns.''
Mr McFall's Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill passed its second reading
in the House by 253 to nil, with 30 Conservative MPs voting in favour.
However, it is expected to be talked out in the committee stage and not
to become law.

J A MOWAT of Burnside, as the listings always had him, died yesterday.
He was 88.
He must certainly rank among the top three Scottish referees since the
resumption of football in 1945.
His war service with the Royal Air Force, in which he was a flight
lieutenant, had brought on his refereeing and while stationed in
Northern Ireland he had officiated at several important Irish League v
Combined Services matches.
Once he became a grade one referee, his rise was swift and unbroken.
By the time his career ended, he had taken charge of seven Scottish Cup
Finals (including four in succession) and six League Cup Finals.
Rather donnish in manner, he had the knack of maintaining discipline
without resorting to over-stringent measures and, indeed, often claimed
never to have sent a player from the field. Whether he could have got
away with that in today's less deferential times is debatable but he
certainly had considerable presence and a natural authority.
He was associated with two famous matches at Hampden, Celtic's 7-1
victory over Rangers in the League Cup Final of 1957, and his glorious
swan-song, the European Cup Final of 1960 between Real Madrid and
Eintracht Frankfurt.
The latter, his last game, has never been equalled in Scotland for
sustained brilliance from both sides and Jack Mowat's willingness to let
play flow contributed greatly to a quite unforgettable occasion. The
football authorities did not need to contribute anything to him because
his match expenses amounted to a mere six pence and he graciously waived
them.
Behind a somewhat formal exterior he was easy to talk to and genuinely
helpful. He took the work of supervising referees very seriously and
devoted much of his later life to it. Not as flamboyant as Tom Wharton,
not as obvious a martinet as Bobby Davidson could be, he was by any
standards a referee of world class.

A SPARSE knot of protesters yesterday took their struggle against the
M77 extension to the doorstep of one of their most vociferous critics,
the former Scottish Office Minister, Allan Stewart.
A group of 18 activists representing the M77 protest and anti-Criminal
Justice Act lobby, the Scottish Defiance Alliance, went to the Eastwood
MP's Neilston house at about 12.30pm.
One man, Mr Nicky McKerrell, knocked on Mr Stewart's door, which was
opened briefly by an elderly woman, then closed.
The group then posted letters expressing their ''distress'' at recent
criticisms of them by Mr Stewart in the House of Commons before
dispersing peacefully when police arrived.
Mr McKerrell, standing outside the front door, pointed out the MP's
garden and said: ''As we can see, Allan Stewart likes his wildlife and
his big garden -- but he wants to deprive the people of Pollok and
Corkerhill of the same facilities and opportunities to enjoy the
countryside of Scotland.
''What would he be saying if somebody tried to route a motorway
through his back garden? Pollok Estate is the back garden of thousands
of people who live in the area.''
Mr McKerrell admitted that the turnout for the event was
disappointing, but cited the poor weather as an inhibiting factor.
Mr Stewart resigned his position as a Scottish Office Minister after
being involved in a Sunday afternoon fracas with motorway protesters
five weeks ago.
Mr Lindsay Keenan said: ''The reason we did this was to show it's
possible to visit somebody peacefully on a Sunday afternoon walk. We
were returning the visit paid by Allan Stewart to our home. It's a shame
his visit was such a contrast to ours.''
Mr Stewart was unavailable for comment last night. He was believed to
have been away for the weekend.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that Wimpey, the contractor for the #53.6m
link, is to consider offering compensation to the protesters for any
items that went missing or were destroyed when they were moved out of a
camp in Corkerhill.
It has been alleged that a camcorder, camera equipment, and a number
of personal effects were removed during the incident last week.
Mr Ron Fraser, Wimpey's project manager, said last night that the
company was investigating the claims and would offer compensation if
there was any substance to the allegations.
He denied suggestions that the company had definite plans to move the
protesters out of their camp at Pollok Estate. He said: ''We are still
in discussion over the future of the protesters' encampment and intend,
in any case, to give them adequate notice of our intentions.''
Speculation had been fuelled by the news that only a small number of
trees outwith the estate are still to be felled by foresters John
Meikle, of Barrhead. Mr Fraser confirmed that tree-felling work was
close to completion, but denied that this meant they would need to move
into the camp in the near future.

CHEMOTHERAPY could be a thing of the past if an Aberdeen scientist
succeeds in his revolutionary research.
Cell pathologist Dr Denys Wheatley has been awarded a grant of
#100,000, and specially designed equipment from a Swiss sponsor, to find
out ways of telling apart cancer cells from health ones.
He intends to devise treatment that will deprive malignant cells of
amino-acids crucial for their survival and growth.
Dr Wheatley explained: ''There is a subtle difference between the two
and we can exploit that to kill off the tumour cells. It is a very
fundamental approach to the way the growth of cells is controlled.''
The basis of the project was conceived by Dr Wheatley and Swiss
scientist, Dr Slobodan Tepic, five years ago, and the pair have now
advanced the studies to the stage where #40,000 was required to design
and develop apparatus for their future investigations.
The apparatus will arrive from Switzerland this week and a team of
five will be dedicated to the project which is being carried out
exclusively in Aberdeen and Davos, Switzerland.
Dr Wheatley said he hoped that his research would provide an
alternative to chemotherapy and that clinical trials would begin in two
years time -- at which stage major funding of millions of pounds would
be required.

<HEADLINE>NHS reforms blamed for bureaucratic boom #1700m bill as administration doubles</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ALAN MACDERMID,MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE introduction of the internal market has cost the National Health
Service an extra #1700m for administration over the past five years, a
report claims today.
The Health Policy Network -- a group formed by the NHS Consultants'
Association and the NHS Support Federation -- says that most of the
extra cost is due to a doubling in administration.
Professor Harry Keen, who chairs the network, said: ''We show from
officially published figures that the administrative and management
overheads of the NHS have doubled to 11.6% of the total budget.''
The report points out that between 1988 and 1993 the number of general
and senior managers rose from 1240 to 20,010 full-time equivalents.
On top of this, administration and clerical staff increased, and the
figures did not include the costs of the many management consultants
employed.
In one hospital the work previously done by two ''treasurers'' was now
done by 17 ''financial assistants'' each with their own computers and
secretarial assistance.
Less obvious, but no less real, was the substantial time spent by
senior medical and nursing staff on running the NHS market, over and
above their normal administrative and management duties.
The report estimates that a contract between a fundholding GP and a
provider could cost an average #250 to transact, so that 20 GPs each
transacting with 20 providers would create 400 transactions at a cost of
#100,000.
''That means more than one pound in every #10 is spent on red tape,
#3500m a year. When the Conservatives came to power the overheads were
running at 5-6%,'' Professor Keen said.
He added that the increased bureaucracy explained why hospital wards
were closing and the shortages of nurses and other vital services even
though the Government claims it is spending more on the NHS.
The report suggests that the White Paper which led to the reforms,
Working for Patients, was flawed.
It points out that a key influence on the reforms was a critique of
the NHS by the American economist Professor Alain Enthoven, who said he
had been invited by the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust to review UK
health services management.
Looking at the NHS from a US perspective, claims the report, Enthoven
saw the need for professional and personal pride in the job to be
displaced by powerful incentives for good practice, including withdrawal
of security of employment for NHS staff.
He had seen the NHS as a system in gridlock, unable to change -- a
claim contradicted by the health services' recent history -- and he
deprecated the absence of billing for anything from a bedpan to an
aspirin.
''The high transactional costs of all-pervasive internal pricing and
billing, a process that is studiously avoided by efficient organisations
such as Marks and Spencer, were advocated without regard to their
expense,'' the report declares, underlining the claim by noting that
administrative costs in the market-led US health-care system run at
around 22% of total health expenditure.
The report comes days after Cambridge Health Authority was taken to
court after it refused to provide treatment to a 10-year-old girl with
leukemia, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal in London on Friday.
An anonymous benefactor has since donated #75,000 to pay for the
treatment.
The family's solicitor, Mr Michael Sinclair, confirmed that the family
was investigating whether the case could go to the House of Lords or
even the European Court of Human Rights.
* A senior cancer specialist has condemned the Government's NHS
reforms as ''expensive and misdirected'' as he retires from the service.
Dr Vladimir Svoboda, a Conservative Party supporter, said the reforms
had forced the NHS to breaking point.
Hospitals were taking the blame when under-funded and over-worked
staff fail to live up to the promises made by the Government, he
alleged.
Dr Svoboda, head of Portsmouth Hospital Trust's oncology department,
said paperwork and bureaucracy were forcing doctors away from patient
care. Only the dedication and loyalty of doctors, nurses, and managers
was stopping patient care suffering.
He said: ''I was initially a supporter of the NHS reforms. But they
have been poorly thought out, misdirected and expensive.
''Too much time and money is being wasted on administration and
bureaucrats.''

SKIER Andrew Wilson, who survived a record three nights trapped in
blizzards, hobbled back to the hills where he was nearly given up for
dead to celebrate his 45th bithrday.
But three weeks on from his ordeal, frostbite forced the cross-country
skier to resist the temptation to head out on to the slopes.
Mr Wilson was approached by Songs of Praise to relive his time of
crisis after revealing exclusively to The Herald how a ''a chat with
God'' helped him overcome the cold.
Yesterday Mr Wilson was reduced to walking with the aid of a stick and
holding on to the arm of his wife Marion. The night before, they had
enjoyed a dinner in Braemar to mark the birthday Mr Wilson nearly never
saw.
A member of King's Park Baptist Church in Glasgow's South Side for the
past 11 years, Mr Wilson said: ''Songs of Praise asked if I would do the
programme after reading in The Herald how I prayed to God that I'd
survive.
''When I was interviewed in the press, I mentioned my prayers and how,
after I'd had a chat with God, I felt relaxed and calm and didn't worry.
''I am a Christian, but not a terribly good one. I do pray a fair bit.
When you are faced with death, as I faced it, I felt I wanted to have a
proper chat with God.
''I was saying that although I didn't want to die, I could face up to
it if I thought I was going to meet God. I honestly believe my prayer
was answered.''
Songs of Praise producers contacted Mr Wilson and asked him to return
to Braemar, where they had been filming for a programme due out on
Sunday, March 26.
''If I hadn't been happy to do the programme, I wouldn't be here. I
thought I'd be reasonably fit, but my feet are terribly sore from
frostbite.
''I have very little feeling in my feet, and any feeling I do have
tends to be pain.
''When I left hospital in Dundee, I thought 'a couple of days and I'll
be fine', but no-one told me it would be so painful.''
He continued: ''I've been lucky. I might lose a toenail, that sort of
thing, but it's not going to give me any serious bother.
''The pain prevents me from sleeping. I'm taking pain-killers, but
it's still three or four in the morning before I eventually fall
asleep.''
Mr Wilson, of Crofton Avenue, Croftfoot, Glasgow, revealed that his
release from hospital had been further delayed because of a stomach
problem.
''I developed an ulcer. The doctors' reckoned it was the stress of
being stuck in the snow.
''Although I didn't feel mentally stressed, my body was going through
a lot of changes. I was consuming a lot of body fat and carbohydrates in
my muscles. I suffered a fair bit of muscle wastage.
''Once I start walking and doing things like eating properly,
everything will come back.''
At the weekend, Mr Wilson got little further than the spot near
Braemar where a helicopter had picked him up and whisked him to
Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. He had survived by eating snow and a Mars
Bar.
Mr Wilson is keen to get back on to the ski slopes.
''I know I'm going to be very apprehensive, but I want to get back on
the hills as soon as I can.
''I won't do anything adventurous, but it's my life. Going out on to
the hills is like breathing -- you do it to live.''

A SIX-WEEK-OLD girl was last night in a serious condition after
undergoing neuro-surgery at the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow,
after her great-grandfather's dog attacked her.
Laura McKellar suffered cuts to her head and a fractured skull when
the Jack Russell-type terrier mauled her as she slept in a pram outside
her great-grandfather's home on Saturday afternoon.
Her parents Linda, 24, and Campbell McKellar, 25, of Russell Street,
Johnstone, were at her bedside last night. Family members were too upset
to talk about the incident.
Laura, an only child, had been left outside the house of her
great-grandfather, Mr Edward Quiggley, at Greenend Avenue, Johnstone,
while her grandmother, Mrs Mary McKellar, 51, visited him.
Mrs McKellar, of High Street, Johnstone, made regular checks on the
baby, but when she came out of the house at 3.30pm she found the dog in
the pram attacking the baby's head.
She forced the dog from the child, sustaining bites to her arms in the
process, but was not seriously injured.
The injured baby was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley,
then transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill,
and later moved to the neuro-sciences intensive care unit at the
Southern General.
The terrier, Timmy, was destroyed humanely by a vet on Mr Quiggley's
instructions.
A neighbour of Mr Quiggley said he had never seen the dog act
aggressively. ''The dog used to play with my dog but he never seemed any
bother,'' he said.

THE simmering row over the replacement of a hospital's Red Cross
cafeteria by a McDonald's restaurant was rekindled last night when an MP
accused the hospital trust of placing its staff at risk of attack from
drug-addicts.
Mr Jimmy Dunnachie, MP for Pollok, has written to the Southern General
NHS Trust expressing his concern over the switch, exclusively revealed
in The Herald last month, and calling on the trust to reverse its
decision.
In the letter to trust chairman Andrew Garland, he warned that were it
to open late at night ''the fast-food outlet would degenerate into a
haunt for drug addicts and other socially troubled groups''.
To back his allegations, Mr Dunnachie cited recent reports of
incidents involving drug users in fast-food restaurants, and suggested
that visitors and patients would be ''driven away'' from using the
facility.
He said last night: ''To make the business work it will have to be
open until late at night, and this is a serious worry.
''No matter what the company says, it cannot guarantee that these
people won't come into a place which is, after all, a hospital.
''Doctors, medical staff, and visitors will have to cross from
building to building, and with drug addicts desperate for money they
could end up in serious trouble.''
Mr Richard Morgan, spokesman for the Southern General Hospital, said
Mr Dunnachie's comments were ''miles over the top''.
He added: ''This is a problem suffered by McDonalds in common with
other fast-food restaurants.
''My understanding is that these people do use fast-food outlets as
well as other places, but we didn't envisage when we discussed the
situation that it was a major problem.''
The restaurant will be open to members of the public, but a condition
imposed by the trust board bars McDonalds from advertising the
restaurant outwith the grounds of the hospital.
The board had considered the ramifications of allowing members of the
public access to the Southern General grounds, and decided there would
be no question of any increased risk to staff. Mr Morgan pointed out
that the hospital had a resident policeman.
McDonalds could not be contacted last night for a response.

THE last remaining Baptist Church in central Glasgow is preparing to
open its doors as a commercial complex after a #1.2m redevelopment.
The 19th century B-listed Adelaide Place Baptist Church has been
transformed into a guest house, restaurant, conference, and nursery
complex.
However, the building will not lose its spiritual function. It will
remain the place of worship for the 100-strong congregation who have
been meeting in a local school during the 18-month redevelopment.
The transformation came about after the congregation considered ways
of saving their church, in the face of heavy maintenance costs and
decided to set up their own development company.
Work on the building is nearing completion after funding of almost
#250,000 from the Glasgow Development Agency, #315,000 from Historic
Scotland, a contribution from Glasgow District Council, and private
sector involvement through the Bank of Scotland.
The complex will create 15 jobs when it opens in May.
The church sanctuary will be used by the congregation but will also be
a commercial venue for conferences, concerts, and other events.
The Rev Jack Quinn, minister at the church, said it would have been
easier to sell the building and find a new location elsewhere, but the
congregation had felt strongly that it should still worship there.
''By carrying out the development in this way, we have been able to
retain the long spiritual tradition of the church, as well as providing
a range of facilities which will ensure its future and enable us to play
a part in helping the people of Glasgow and contributing to its
economy.''
Mr Sandy Meiklejohn, who is in charge of the commercial side of the
operation, is convinced that the blend of activities will bring success.
''We are right in the heart of the city and will be providing a range
of facilities which are much in demand.
''The hotel, which will have 20 beds and is pitched at the middle
range for tourists and business customers, and the self-service
restaurant and sandwich bar could not be better placed. The nursery
facility is also ideally suited for working parents to drop off their
young children before going to work in the city.''
Mr Martin Davidson, director of property for the Glasgow Development
Agency, said that its involvement had helped retain an important
city-centre building as well as creating a new venture in line with a
number of the agency's economic strategies.

FRAUD squad officers are investigating the alleged
''misappropriation'' of cash from the Stirling headquarters of Scottish
Amicable.
Inquiries by Central Scotland Police began last week after the life
assurance society lodged a complaint regarding ''a financial anomaly''.
A deficit of about #40,000 was uncovered in the claims department of
the company after it emerged that a policy pay-out claimed by a customer
had already been paid out.
The police investigation is thought to involve Mr Ian Douglas, 22, who
worked as a clerk in the assurance company's claims department. Mr
Douglas, who has been employed with the company for a few years, has not
been seen at work or at his home in Stirling's Union Street since early
last week.
Unconfirmed reports have suggested that Mr Douglas has left the
country with his friend and flatmate, Mr Tony Mulhearn, who is also 22.
Mrs Margaret Tangney, a neighbour of Mr Douglas, told yesterday how
she heard banging outside her home on Friday, and when she looked out
discovered ''police had bashed the door in''.
The pensioner said she had met only one of the young men, who had told
her last September that he was a student. ''I didn't know their names,''
she added.
Company spokesman Jim Mitchell said: ''We are investigating the
background to a financial anomaly within the company and are being
assisted by police. We would like to speak to Mr Douglas in connection
with the matter.''
Mr Mitchell sought to reassure policyholders that their interests
would not be affected by the investigation. ''The amount involved is in
the order of #40,000,'' he said.
A police spokesman said he could not confirm reports that Mr Douglas
was involved or that he had left the country. He would only say: ''We
received a complaint from Scottish Amicable regarding the
misappropriation of monies. Our investigations are continuing.''

<TEXT>
PEOPLE in Gourock were in the dumps over a smell yesterday --
literally.
For years, residents in the vicinity of the infill site at the former
Craigmuschat quarry have been complaining bitterly about headaches, sore
throats, and nausea and claiming that they were caused by fumes from the
site.
But renewed concern in the past few months forced Inverclyde District
Council to declare an open day at the site yesterday.
Dumping of baled household refuse began there in 1987 and it is now
calculated that the former quarry holds around one million tonnes of
rubbish from homes in Greenock, Gourock and Port Glasgow.
In some parts of the dump, rubbish is packed to a depth of 45 metres.
Recently, columns of steam have been rising from several points -- what
in other countries might indicate geothermal springs.
Some people feared there was a massive cauldron boiling underneath and
it was set to explode. Environmental health officials capped the vents
with charcoal-filled drums.
Mr Ronnie Dinnie, operations manager with the council's cleansing
department, said: ''We are surprised at the ferocity of people's
complaints about the concentration of the smell. We have always said
there was a smell on site but I don't see how they can get it in strong
concentrations in their houses.''
Sharon Lindsay, one of four environmental health officers showing
visitors around, said: ''We seem to get more complaints on a Monday
after people have spent the weekend in their homes.''
She said gas coming from the vents was about 70% methane with the rest
carbon dioxide. ''Some people think we are taking in toxic waste but
that is not true,'' she added.
Liberal Councillor Jim Hunter, a local resident, has always maintined
that the quarry should never have been used as a dump because it was so
near the centre of the town.
Still coughing an hour after he inadvisedly approached too close to
one of the vents, he said: ''The coup is like a big witch's cauldron.
The rubbish is being dumped in and the rain adds water. Then it casts a
witch's smell over Gourock.''
He added that, although the site was well run, he thought the stench
would last for many years.
The infilling of baled waste ends this month and refuse -- in
lorryloads per day -- will be taken to a site off London Road in
Glasgow.
There are plans for turning the former quarry into a recreation site
in a few years, with a dry ski slope and toboggan runs.

TELEVISION'S Spitting Image is about to make fun of the royal family
for the last time.
Central Television announced last night that the programme is to be
scrapped in the autumn.
During the past 11 years, the show has lampooned the royals,
politicians, sport and showbiz personalities, and American presidents.
But last night, many of them were sorry to see it go. Despite the
unflattering imagery, the ''victims'' regarded being featured in the
show as a status symbol.
Tory MP Edwina Currie, one of the most shocking puppets dressed as a
Cruella de Ville vampire, said she was secretly flattered.
''It may be that we have all learned a lot from Spitting Image. In
retrospect, I think they got my caricature about right. I grew quite
fond of it.
''I am sad to see it go, but I am not suprised. So many of the
characters they lampooned like the royal family, have behaved so
outrageously that no-one can make a joke out of it anymore.''
Another unlikely fan turned out to be clean-up television campaigner
Mary Whitehouse.
She was often depicted having tea with the Archbishop of Canterbury of
the time and singer Cliff Richard.
Mrs Whitehouse said: ''In many ways, it was very clever. If the
archbishop cannot take a bit of a joke, then it's a poor state of
affairs.''
The show was axed by the ITV network centre after a fall in ratings
from 15 million to 6.4 million, and criticism that the satirical series
had lost its sting.
Peter Fluck, who makes the puppets with Roger Law, said: ''The problem
is, public relations people have knocked the corners off some
characters, so they seem more boring than they really are.''

BRITISH employees are working long hours to compensate for low levels
of pay, the GMB union claimed yesterday.
The union published a study showing that eight million people, almost
40% of the UK workforce, spend more than 40 hours at work each week. In
Scotland, the figure falls to 35%, although 8% say they work more than
50 hours, and 3% more than 60 hours.
GMB official Colin Christopher said: ''The main reason for long hours
is that wages are so low that millions need the hours to earn enough to
survive.
''If long hours could be avoided and the work shared out, it could
take about 1,400,000 workers off the dole -- more than enough to find
jobs for Britain's 930,000 long-term unemployed.
''The national minimum wage will kill the need for long hours and save
everybody money. Britain needs it urgently.''
* Pay awards in Scotland's engineering sector have risen to an average
of 3.6%, according to data published yesterday by the industry group
Scottish Engineering.

POLICE in the Glasgow area last night issued a warning to elderly
people after bogus callers entered homes and stole cash.
An 84-year-old woman was robbed of #2000 after being duped by a woman
posing as a doctor's messenger.
The incident happened in Kelvindale, when Mrs Helen Bradley answered
the door to a woman of Asian appearance.
Mrs Bradley, a heart-stroke victim, who had been expecting a visit
from hospital staff, allowed the visitor in and made her a cup of tea.
About an hour after the woman left, Mrs Bradley realised money was
missing from her handbag.
An upstairs neighbour reported an Asian-looking man who offered her a
good-luck charm around the same time.
Last night, Detective Constable Jimmy Duncan, Maryhill CID, appealed
for information. The woman is described as between 40 to 50, chubby, and
was wearing a raincoat.
The man, about the same age, was stocky with a fat face and carried a
suitcase.
* In an unconnected incident, police in Dumbarton were last night
hunting two thieves -- described as Asians in their early 30s -- who
took #250 from a 67-year-old woman after asking to use her lavatory.
The victim, from Milton, was so distressed she had to be moved into
sheltered housing.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said: ''Everyone, but especially the
elderly, must be very careful when allowing strangers into their home.
If in doubt at all, always seek identification and, if suspicious,
contact the police.''

WATER contamination which made 300 people ill in a Fife village was
being blamed last night on a local vegetable processing company.
The outbreak at the weekend brought misery to young and old alike in
Freuchie -- population 1020 -- with sickness, diarrhoea, and headaches.
It was thought by Fife Regional Council's water services staff to have
been caused by Kettle Produce, a firm of vegetable prepackers, although
the council did not name the company in a press statement.
The council spokeswoman said the source had been traced to a company
which had its own bore hole for flushing out water from the processing
plant into the Freuchie burn. At the end of last week, the discharge had
inadvertently got into the public water supply.
The spokeswoman said it was possible a report would be made to the
procurator-fiscal later this week. Kettle Produce refused to comment
last night.
Freuchie residents were being told yesterday to continue to boil their
drinking water, advice which was first given late on Friday night, when
leaflets were distributed to every household.
Loudhailers continued to tour the village yesterday and water tankers
had been installed at three places for residents to draw fresh water.
Mr Louis Purdie, the council's principal chemist, spent the weekend
analysing samples of water and was able to report yesterday that the
contamination was decreasing. He expected it would be gone by today.
The council said Freuchie was supplied from regional sources, through
a trunk main, to a service reservoir in the hills about half-a-mile from
the village. The village was directly fed from the service reservoir.
Neither the service reservoir nor the main to the village was affected
by the contamination, due to the presence of a pressure-reducing valve
on the main outside the village.
One resident, Mr Neil McCance, 41, a furniture designer, said he was
so ill on Saturday: ''I thought I was dying''. His symptoms were
diarrhoea, a pounding headache, stomach cramps, and nausea.
''We noticed our water was brown on Wednesday and, on Thursday, my
wife starting getting dizzy. Later on Friday night, we were told the
water was not drinkable,'' he said.
Ms Gaynor McMillan, 17, of Main Street, Freuchie, said yesterday she
had been ''sick all the time'', and all her friends had been affected.
She was drinking only mineral water and had not eaten for 24 hours.
Another resident, Mr David Gordon, 61, said his wife and son had been
ill for two days with sickness and diarrhoea. He added: ''Freuchie has
been famous for its cricket. Now we are famous because of the plague.''
Freuchie Community Council is organising a public meeting on Thursday
to seek an explanation of the outbreak. Mrs Margaret Gray, of Main
Street, a member of the community council, said: ''We want to find out
how it happened. We want water and health officials to be present at the
meeting.''
Mrs Gray, whose daughter Joanne, 15, was recovering yesterday from
sickness, said: ''Children and old folk have been badly affected.''

A WARNING has been issued to beware of fake paramedics who could kill,
maim or paralyse any casualty they stumble across.
The warning follows the court appearance last week of a man who was
arrested after he inserted a needle into the arm of an unconscious woman
as she lay in her crashed car.
An array of out-of-date medicines, syringes and ambulance clothing was
among 130 items seized by police when they arrested Paul Corney, 48, on
the M40.
Constable Neil Chambers, the arresting officer, said the Association
of Chief Ambulance Officers had written to Health Secretary Virginia
Bottomley, asking for a tightening up of legislation to prevent bogus
paramedics practising.''
Mr John Divall, training manager for the Royal Berkshire Ambulance NHS
Trust, said: ''There are a number of groups which have set themselves up
as paramedics but which have no training or qualifications and it is a
matter which is causing grave concern.
''Paramedics were given the authority to intubate and infuse patients
under a revision of the Medicines Act, but there is a very real danger
of cowboys getting in on the act and causing serious harm.''
The problem had been pointed out to the Department of Health.
''I understand that they asked the Association of Chief Police
Officers to monitor cases where this sort of thing has happened in the
past and that the whole matter is being closely observed at ministerial
level.''
Mr Divall said there was also a problem with organisers of public
events hiring ''paramedic'' firms which boasted paramedic skills when in
fact they were not qualified.
''It seems that almost anyone can impersonate an ambulance paramedic
with virtual impugnity. We want the laws tightened up and the public
made aware that identification and proof of qualification should always
be on show.''

<TEXT>
A SCHEME to sell cigarettes at savings of more than #1 a packet is
being launched today by a company which has won the right to get round
paying British duty.
The Man In Black company aims to sell most major brands at savings of
40% after winning an injunction against Customs and Excise in the High
Court last week.
The scheme takes advantage of European Single Market rules which
allows the import of unlimited amounts of cigarettes as long as they are
for personal use.
A major advertising campaign will be launched to publicise the
money-saving scheme, hailed by the company as a breakthrough for
European integration.
In effect, the company acts as the smoker's agent, buying the
cigarettes at lower European prices and sending them to the smoker by
courier or post. It claims that the average 20-a day smoker could save
about #40 a month.
Customs and Excise -- which receives #6000m a year in tobacco duty --
has had to give a legal undertaking to return consignments seized since
the scheme was first launched last November.
Both sides are now awaiting the outcome of a judicial review, set for
May 5, to see if the Man In Black company, which will trade under the
name Tobacco Direct, will be allowed to continue.
Tobacco Direct is a subsidiary of the Enlightened Tobacco Company,
which began selling its distinctive Death brand cigarettes in 1991.
Tobacco Direct director B J Cunningham said the scheme was the first
of its kind and the test case could open the doors to a whole range of
goods with high British duty, such as alcohol and perfume, being sold in
this way.

A SCOT was arrested in Spain yesterday after airport police allegedly
found pure cocaine with a street value of more than #200,000 in his
luggage.
Detectives said Mr Simon Wiseman, 23, from Glasgow, had flown to
Madrid from Colombia and was stopped in a routine check at customs.
The flight from Bogota is used frequently by drugs smugglers. Three
other passengers on yesterday's flight were also arrested, and cocaine
worth #1.5m was recovered.
Police alleged that Mr Wiseman had been carrying three kilogrammes of
the drug.
He gave officers no personal details other than saying that he was a
businessman and had a girlfriend in Glasgow.
Mr Wiseman is believed to have flown from Britain to Colombia a few
days ago and was booked on a flight from Spain to London.
He was taken to Madrid's Carabanchal prison and is expected to make a
private appearance before a judge later today. If ordered to face trial,
he could spend about six months on remand.

A PLATE of seafood spaghetti costing #6 turned out to be a solid
investment for businessman Ian Thomson. In among the pasta, mussels,
clams, and scallops he found a pearl, worth #60.
The happy discovery came as Mr Thomson, of Muirton Bank, Perth, was
lunching in the fair city's Italian Corner restaurant.
''Seafood spaghetti has always been a favourite dish of mine,'' said
Mr Thomson, who also managed a win on the National Lottery later in the
day. ''But I never expected to make money out of it.''
The gem which Mr Thomson crunched on was shown to local jeweller Scott
Henderson, of W T Henderson and Co, who said: ''We buy quite a lot of
pearls which are usually found in freshwater mussels in Scottish rivers.
''But this is the first time I've ever heard of someone finding one in
their pasta.
''Pearls come in all shapes, sizes and colours. This one is actually
quite well formed. It's rounded and has a nice lustre. Pearls are valued
by the grain and we price them on the basis of #15 a grain. This one is
worth about #60.''
Chef Marcello Frulloni added a cautionary note: ''I've never come
across anything like this before. I don't want people to think we
include pearls in all of our seafood dishes -- Mr Thomson got lucky.
''All of his friends were amazed and it was the talk of the
restaurant. Mr Thomson has certainly come up a winner with his
discovery.''
Mr Thomson, however, is not selling his find. He said: ''I'm keeping
it for posterity. It's a good talking point. Saturday was my lucky day,
I had four numbers in the lottery and won #47 on that as well.''

THE OUTSIDEBroadcast Unit of BBC Scotland has been axed in favour of
an English-based company.
It will result in the loss of 30 jobs and comes less than a week after
almost 100 job losses were announced at Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow.
The Herald disclosed last week that the Outside Broadcast Unit, one of
the key departments within BBC Scotland, had been placed out to tender
as part of the London-inspired Producer Choice process.
The existing OB unit in Scotland, with some help from its opposite
number in London, had submitted a tender and was thought to have a
fighting chance of retaining the function despite four tenders from
English companies.
However, in spite of official denials yesterday from the BBC that a
decision had been made, The Herald understands the contract has been
awarded outside Scotland.
Outside broadcast crews, in Inverness at the weekend for the Scottish
Labour Party conference, have been approached by senior management and
told their tender has been unsuccessful.
Mr Eric Jacobs, Scottish organiser of Bectu, the broadcasting union,
is understood to have been in contact yesterday with his members over
the issue.
It is likely the successful English-based company would have an
outside broadcast base in Glasgow and would probably re-employ some of
those made redundant on a freelance, or independent basis.
While regular items such as the coverage of Scottish football would
continue, Mr Henry McCubbin, Labour MEP for North East Scotland,
questioned whether BBC Scotland would have the resources to cover a
disaster of the magnitude of Lockerbie or Piper Alpha if the OB unit
were axed.
The MEP, a former television cameraman, said: ''There is a critical
mass you have to keep if you are to maintain your commitment.
''These are highly paid, highly skilled jobs that we are losing. This
loss will have a far greater impact than would appear from the bare
figures of just 30 posts.
''The loss of the outside broadcasting unit to BBC Scotland combined
with the loss of more than 90 jobs announced last week has to be seen in
the context of a #3m shortfall in BBC Scotland's production budget.''
Mr McCubbin said the crews involved had shown great flexibility over
the years, working long hours and staying with any story they were
covering. He added: ''It seems incredible to me that having met these
commitments to public service broadcasting this is what happens to them
now.''
A union source said: ''The long-term aspect of this decision will be
devastating if it goes through. Last week's redundancies were crucial in
themselves but this latest decision is a disaster.''
Less than a week ago it was announced that BBC Scotland's costume
design, make-up, scenic design, and scenic servicing operations were
being axed with the loss of almost 100 jobs.
The Broadcasting Council for Scotland, the organisation which
represents the licence payer and controls the policy and content of BBC
Scotland's programmes, warned last week that an important part of the
skills base crucially important to the wellbeing of the broadcasting
industry in Scotland was being lost.
A BBC Scotland spokeswoman said yesterday: ''The Outside Broadcast
Unit is out to tender but no decision has been made yet. There will
probably be a decision in the next couple of weeks.''

PRIVATISED utility chiefs are expected to escape specific legislation
on boardroom pay, it emerged yesterday.
But the Greenbury Committee, set up by the Confederation of British
Industry to investigate executive pay and perks, will consider wider
legal moves to increase openness and public scrutiny.
Sources close to the committee believe it could recommend that no
executives should have a say in setting their own salary levels and that
full details of remuneration -- including bonuses, share options and
pension arrangements -- should be published.
The Prime Minister is travelling in the Middle East with a
high-powered trade delegation, including CBI director general Howard
Davies and Marks &amp; Spencer chairman Sir Richard Greenbury, the man
leading the investigation.
The inquiry was set up to combat mounting public anger at what many
saw as excessive boardroom pay rises.
One senior industrialist in the British party said the changes being
considered by the Greenbury Committee could probably be implemented more
easily and more quickly by altering Stock Exchange rules, without the
need to pass legislation.
Mr Major has told MPs that he is now ready to give legal backing if
necessary to the committee's recommendations, and highlighted as two
central issues the publication of salary details and concerns that share
options were not being earned.
The committee may also suggest that salaries and pay rises should take
into account the amount of competition faced by the company concerned.
Businessmen travelling with the Prime Minister are irritated at being
lumped together with the executives of privatised companies, which often
operate in a near monopoly.
They believe that the public understands that the chairmen and
directors of major companies facing the full force of competition in the
market place are entitled to large salaries.

From GEOFFREY PARKHOUSE in Jerusalem
BENEDICT BROGAN in London and
PATRICK BROGAN in Washington
TOUGH new stances by the Prime Minister and Sinn Fein leaders
threatened to stall the Northern Ireland peace process last night.
Mr Major wants the political wing of the IRA to renounce terrorism
like PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness claimed
this was not realistic.
The issue was further complicated for Mr Major by growing concern
among his back benchers over the direction the peace process is taking,
a concern which is threatening to turn into open revolt today: 30 Tory
MPs are prepared to sign a motion condemning the Government for diluting
its tough stance on IRA weapons.
Emboldened by President Clinton's agreement to meet Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams at the White House and to permit fund raising in the USA, Mr
McGuinness said it would not be put in the position by the British
Government ''where Sinn Fein comes into conflict or confrontation with
the IRA''.
He insisted on LWT's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: ''It is not
realistic or sensible to expect in the present peace process that Sinn
Fein should go to the IRA and demand that the IRA decommission its
weapons before Sinn Fein goes into talks with British Ministers.''
The Prime Minister who is to meet Mr Arafat in Gaza tomorrow, was keen
to reject any comparison with this meeting and the one the Government is
refusing to hold with Sinn Fein before the IRA makes a substantive move
to hand over its weapons.
After a meeting with Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin, Mr Major said;
''Terrorism has now been renounced by Chairman Arafat. I have not seen
it comprehensively denounced by Mr Adams. Chairman Arafat is now
actively opposing terrorism. I am afraid that Sinn Fein is still
directly associated with a fully formed terrorist organisation.''
The Prime Minister also seemed to be sending a message to President
Clinton who has infuriated him by inviting Mr Adams to the White House
on St Patrick's Day, and, worse still, permitting Sinn Fein to raise
funds again in America.
Despite the hard-line stance by Mr Major, Irish Premier John Bruton,
who is expected to see Mr Adams at least twice in Washington this week
during the St Patrick's Day celebrations, indicated there would be talks
soon between Sinn Fein and British Government Ministers, and spoke of
the need for concessions from both sides.
Speaking on Irish radio from Copenhagen, where he is attending the UN
conference on social development, he said: ''I think it is important
that people meet, and I am delighted there is now going to be a meeting
at Ministerial level with Sinn Fein.''
However, Mr Major stated: ''Chairman Arafat has signed the declaration
of principles. Sinn Fein have not yet committed themselves to the
Downing Street Declaration and are not yet party to any agreement on
Northern Ireland.
''The Government entered into diplomatic contacts with Chairman Arafat
after he explicity renounced terrorism. It was only after he signed the
declaration of principles that I met him in Downing Street last year.''
He said attempts to compare the positions of Yasser Arafat and Gerry
Adams is ''mischievous''.
He will present Mr Arafat with 50 Land Rovers to help his civil police
force fight the terrorists trying to wreck the peace process in the
Middle East. He is to announce further British aid, which already tops
#75m, and he is taking a party of leading British businessmen with him
to improve job-creating trade.
It is the Prime Minister's intention to show that old enemies can
become friends and allies providing violence is abandonded. He
emphasised this at a dinner hosted by Mr Rabin in the Kind David Hotel:
''We are constantly tested. The scourge of terrorism has afflicted both
our countries. There can be no place for violence in a democratic state.
We agree that terrorism is a common enemy and must be implacably
opposed.''
Last week his Government appeared to be softening its attitude towards
the hand-over of the IRA's arsenal, much to the alarm of the Ulster
Unionists. Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew appeared to
concede that only ''some'' arms would need to be scrapped in order for
Minister-level talks to begin.
Now in a potentially damaging blow to Tory unity over Ulster, Mr
Andrew Hunter, the chairman of the Tory back-bench Northern Ireland
committee, has agreed to table a critical motion drafted by Ulster
Unionist MP Ken Maginnis.
He claims about 30 Tory MP are prepared to sign it as a way of
expressing their anger at the Government's concession over the phrase
''some'' IRA weapons.
Mr Major is using his meeting with Mr Arafat, long considered one of
the world's leading terrorists, to reassure that his attitude has not
softened towards the IRA. It now seems unlikely he will permit his
negotiating Minister, Mr Michael Ancram, to meet Sinn Fein for some time
to come.
If Sinn Fein remains intransigent about persuading the IRA to begin
giving up weapons there is the threat of renewed violence. Mr McGuinness
said: ''Who can say what will happen in a situation where the British
Government turns round to everybody and says they are not going to meet
Sinn Fein, that there is not going to be all party talks?''
Tomorrow, Mr Adams will be in Washington to open a Sinn Fein office.
He will use the occasion for a speech, which will be awaited with
interest, but not as much as the final, most important detail of his
trip which has still to be settled: will the cameras record the moment
when he meets President Clinton?
Mr Adams's visit is all about symbolism, and this is the crucial
question. The British have protested bitterly, but the odds are strong
that the picture will go around the world.
There is nothing new in former terrorists being received by democratic
leaders, and Mr Arafat was the last to be received at the White House.
Despite Mr Major's stance yesterday, the Americans have concluded that
Mr Adams fits into that category.

THE leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland yesterday celebrated a
successful conference which had backed leader Tony Blair in his drive to
modernise the party and re-draft its constitution.
However, with Mr Blair's new Clause 4 wording due to be announced
today, a number of Scottish activists left Inverness complaining
bitterly that the party was drifting inexorably to the right.
Two experienced members of the Scottish Executive, Mr Archie Graham
and Ms Johann Lamont, were voted out of office, and complained
afterwards that their demise was part of a policy shift in the Scottish
party.
Ms Lamont said: ''There is a rightward shift in terms of closing down
debate in the party, in which any criticism of the Clause 4 debate has
been taken badly. They want a party that is more compliant.''
Mr Graham said: ''There are continuous attempts to stifle debate.''
The voting down of two experienced members of the executive came at a
time when a number of other changes were agreed, which saw a youth
delegate removed amid claims that this had been achieved by last-minute
alterations to the voting system.
This is to be taken up by critics unhappy with the suggestion that one
member lost his place on the executive committee as a result of failing
to give Mr Blair a standing ovation on Friday.
However, the leadership was in bullish mood at the close of
conference. Mr George Robertson, Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland,
said it had been an extremely successful conference which would provide
an effective start to the party's local government election campaign.
Mr Jack McConnell, Scottish Secretary of the party, said: ''All those
who have served on the executive have a role to play in the party in the
future. There are some excellent members who are not going to be around,
but we have the best geographical spread of executive members ever.''
Asked about speculation that the changes in the executive represented
a shift to the right, he said: ''These terms no longer have any meaning
in the Labour Party.''
The conference ran over the weekend as a well-oiled machine and, while
most delegates were pleased by Labour's new public self-confidence,
there were a series of small disputes over procedure and the way the
agenda was handled from the platform.
Apart from the dispute over the process for re-electing youth
delegates to the executive committee, there had been a row at the end of
Saturday's proceedings when a vote on pensions and benefits, which
appeared to be supported on a show of hands from the floor, was ruled
otherwise and no card vote was then permitted.
But Mr Jim Devine, Scottish party chairman, who was widely praised for
his good-natured handling of the conference, said later that he had used
his judgment to interpret the vote on the basis of union mandates in
deciding the result.
The conference, which saw a spectacular success for leader Tony Blair
on Friday, closed with an equally resounding ovation for Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown yesterday.
