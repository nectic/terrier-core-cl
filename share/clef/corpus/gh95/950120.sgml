THE man who took Scottish football by the scruff of its neck in the
eighties and shook it into the modern world is refreshed, invigorated,
hungry, and ready to return.
Wallace Mercer is back in town, and if the last decade is any guide,
the cosy world of our national game may be subjected to another almighty
shake-up.
It is almost two years since the former Hearts chairman left these
shores for tax purposes, but after watching his favourites defeat
Hibernian 2-0, it was clear there could be a second coming.
''I have my appetite back for the game, and my passion remains. Never
say never in this world,'' insisted Mercer. ''I'm enjoying my football
again, and despite what many will say, there is no doubt that investing
in the sport can be a worthwhile venture.
''The shareholders who came on board with me in 1981, had the option
of taking a sixfold return on their investment when I traded on the club
last summer. I would not rule out the possibility of becoming involved
again in some capacity, for there are many reasons for doing so besides
money.''
Mercer moulded Hearts into a force in Scottish football during 12
years as chairman when they travelled from the first division to the
heights in Europe.
And typically, while his batteries have been recharged in the south of
France, he assembled with the best in Europe to re-establish his
football priorities.
Recently he drove into northern Italy with his son, Ian, to take in
the Sampdoria-Parma match and rekindle warm memories of the 1990
Scotland World Cup campaign.
And he was recently a guest of Bayern Munich's president Franz
Beckenbauer in the Olympic Stadium, when Dynamo Dresden were the
visitors in a Bundesliga match.
His adopted home town club, Cannes, with gates of around 8000, sit
ambitiously in third place in the French League, and he has become a
frequent visitor to their games.
It was by way of escape that ''The Great Waldo'' sold 50.1% of his
shares to Chris Robinson and Leslie Deans last June. The ravages of more
than a decade in charge had taken their toll.
While the recession was making his core business in property risky and
stressful, Hearts, after the relentless progress under Alex MacDonald,
were slipping back.
The final season, with the spectre of relegation a constant inhabitant
at Tynecastle, was the last straw, despite Sandy Clark leading the club
to safety.
But after 21 months locked away in the exclusive Provence village of
Moujins, he is tanned, sharp, and ready to assess the many challenges
that have been presented to him recently.
The ability to shock always sat easily on the tip of Mercer's waspish,
but still warm tongue, and his remedy for some of Scottish football's
current ills will cause a flutter or two.
He believes that the success of Celtic's current share issue is
fundamental to the future wellbeing of the game, although with a wry
smile, he adds that his money is still in his pocket.
''I am perturbed by the sameness in many features of the Scottish
game. Aberdeen and Dundee United are in transition, as are Hearts, but
even in the same state, Rangers are simply streets ahead,'' he
cautioned.
''There must be a challenge to Rangers and I believe that Celtic are
the only club who can provide that consistently. It is crucial that
their share issue succeeds.
''I am certain that David Murray will want the Celtic share issue to
succeed. At the moment David is selling tens of thousands of season
tickets and that will continue.
''But in the longer term, Rangers will need a challenge from somewhere
and Celtic, it seems to me, are going the right way to give the game its
competitive edge again.
''From what I can see, their effort to raise capital looks to be a
good investment and I hope it is as successful as all the predictions.''
Predictably, he spots hopeful signs for the finances of a sport
struggling to arrest sliding attendances.
''The involvement of Sky Television once again in Scottish football
will create cash that will allow clubs to invest in players and meet the
requirements of the Taylor Report,'' he reflected.
He still has an involvement with Hearts, of course, retaining 25 per
cent of the stock, while still supporting the new regime with a personal
#1m guarantee until May.
But with visits to the UK still something of a rarity, that passive
connection may not be enough to stifle the flood of adrenalin that has
accompanied his stay in France.
Mercer may not be everyone's cup of tea, but when he appears, the
mundane disappears. The old vitality and mischief are back.
He is fond of recalling a conversation with Jock Wallace in his first
season as chairman, when Mercer hoped to convince Wallace that he was
the man to lead Hearts towards a great and glorious future. ''Ye canna
afford me son, but I'll see you along the highways and the byways,'' was
Big Jock's typically gruff, straight response.
Next time you turn a corner, look out. ''The Great Waldo'' could be
back.

JAMES TRAYNOR warns that Tommy McLean will consider his future unless
cash is made available.
HEARTS have picked themselves a small gem in Tommy McLean, but if they
wish to keep him at Tynecastle, they will have to invest money in the
team. If they don't, McLean, who is growing weary after years of
struggling by on shoe-string budgets, might just walk away.
Despite his reluctance to vie for back-page headlines, McLean is a
fiercely ambitious man and there should be no doubts about why he went
to Tynecastle. He made the move because he believed he would be given a
better opportunity to achieve success, and he is impatient.
''There is a route which I've marked out for myself,'' he said, ''and
I won't allow anyone to push me off course.''
McLean must have been convinced money would be made available to spend
on players to rebuild Hearts, but so far he has had little more than
coppers, and loose change will not do it for McLean any more. Now, he
wants decent money.
If Hearts' chairman Chris Robinson, who has taken it upon himself to
preside over the club in extremely difficult days when Tynecastle must
be rebuilt, wants to keep his manager, who has already won over the
supporters, he will somehow have to finance excursions into the transfer
market.
A decade of struggling against the odds as manager of Motherwell has
left McLean hungry for success and now he wishes to compete on level
terms with his rivals.
McLean, who is 47 years old, probably feels he is due a decent shake
and simple logic tells he would leave Fir Park in search of better
working conditions.
Having fashioned Motherwell into a Scottish Cup winning side, which
gave them a taste for European football, McLean could have stayed in
Lanarkshire where he had security of employment and credibility. His
single-mindedness and his work came to be applauded in those parts after
having taken severe abuse from Motherwell's supporters in the early
years.
When he left, there was a great feeling of regret among people who
have lost much more than football matches. When Ravenscraig closed,
McLean told his players they had a duty to provide the people of
Motherwell with some relief, and this helped the fans feel they had one
of the game's best managers after all.
He didn't have to work outside Lanarkshire, but the appeal of Hearts,
who have potentially the third largest support in the country after the
Old Firm, could not be resisted. He saw a chance to prove he could do
more than make the most of limited resources, and he saw an opportunity
to spend some money and take Hearts on to a new level.
Hearts may have believed they could entice McLean to Edinburgh where,
like some kind of footballing alchemist, he would breath fresh life into
a fading team while attempts were made to strengthen the club's
financial position. McLean does that particular holding job better than
anyone else, but he will not be used in this manner any longer.
''One thing I can assure you about is that I am not prepared to go
down that route again,'' he said yesterday as the warmth of another
Edinburgh derby wafted around Tynecastle, and it was typical of him to
be in his usual place despite the trauma of crashing his car in the
blizzard which made the journey between Edinburgh and the west hazardous
after the match on Wednesday night.
''I had 10 years of a struggle at Motherwell and I'm 10 years older
and wiser,'' he added. ''I don't want to be regarded just as a manager
who can work with limited resources.
''No one could ever question my commitment or loyalty to this game,
but after a while you do have periods when you wonder if it is all worth
it. I sometimes ask myself if I need all this hassle. I'm not sure at
times.
''My wife Beth was just pointing out to me the other day that I've
been in football for 33 years and I've never had a break. That's a very
long time and it takes a toll. It affects your family and sometimes your
mind gets tired.''
McLean, who admits to having become ''a wee bit disillusioned'' by it
all, has considered taking time out, perhaps a year just to recharge the
batteries, but he dare not risk that. From a distance his dislike of
agents and some other people who can be found in the modern game might
become acute and prevent him from rejoining.
''And then what?'' he asks. ''I think to myself, 'what else would you
do?' Football has this hold on people, it pulls us in all the time.''
Frankly, there is nothing people like McLean, who is steeped in
football and its traditions, could find to replace the thrill of seeing
their players win a match, especially against one of the powers, like
Rangers who play Hearts at Ibrox tomorrow. They go into an arena which
often can leave opposition players in awe and afraid to play, but
McLean's side will not step on to the pitch with fear gnawing at them.
They will be bold and aggressive -- the Tommy McLean way and Hearts
are beginning to thrive because of it.
Yet, McLean had to watch Alan McLaren and Tosh McKinlay leave and then
do without Craig Levein for 10 matches because of suspension at a time
when the team was beginning to settle. ''It was in September when we won
five out of six matches, but then we fell away a bit after the
disruption of players leaving and being unavailable,'' he said.
''But we seem to be settling again and we are edging up beside the
teams at the top of the division. A European place? I don't think we are
good enough for that yet, although I suppose we are as good as any of
the other sides trying to get into Europe.
A place in the UEFA Cup, or even European Cup-winners' Cup would
certainly generate revenue which could make it easier for McLean to sign
a player. ''But I would have to wait maybe as long as a year for that. I
don't want to wait,'' he said.
It wasn't a threat, but Hearts' directors would be wise to listen and
read between the lines. They don't have much money, but they must ask
themselves one question. Can we afford to lose McLean?

KEVIN Whitley, a 6ft 6in. lock from Alberta, has been called into
Canada's team for the rugby international against Scotland tomorrow.
Whitley wins his first cap in place of the unavailable Norm Hadley,
who played against England and France last month.
There are two other changes in the side beaten by France, Ron Toews
taking over on the left wing and Winston Stanley moving to the right
wing.
Although the tourists will sadly miss Hadlee at Murrayfield, it
remains a strong team, with a dangerous back division capable of scoring
tries, as was witnessed by the three against England.
Skipper Gareth Rees said that his team would still be striving to play
open, entertaining rugby. ''We learned a lot from our heavy defeat by
England and polished up our performance against France,'' he added.
Although the Canadians went down 28-9 in that game, stand-off Rees
stressed that it was closer than the score suggests. ''We led 9-8 until
the last 20 minutes. And the final French try came in injury time.''
Ian Birtwell, the Canadian coach, admitted that little was known of
the new men in the Scotland team. ''I realise there was a need for
radical Scottish changes because of their recent defeats, but 10 changes
are an awful lot,'' he said. ''It could work against them.
''It is harder for us to prepare against a side that has been changed
so much but we have set a course to play entertaining rugby. We may kick
a bit but the emphasis will still be on moving the ball.''
Canada -- S Stewart; W Stanley, C Stewart, S Gray, R Toews; G Rees
(captain), J Graf; E Evans, M Cardinal, D Jackart, M James, K Whitley, I
Gordon, C McKenzie, G Mackinnon. Replacements -- K Svoboda, P LeBlanc, J
Hutchinson, B Breen, I Mackay, B Ross.

RANGERS may be about to go Dutch in their search for fresh talent, and
one of their targets could be Feyenoord striker Johan van Loen.
A Dutch radio station reported last night that the Rotterdam club and
Rangers have had discussions about the player, who has been capped by
Holland. Van Loen, a tall, red-haired striker, has made it clear he
would like a move.
Walter Smith, of course, is having problems with strikers these days
as both Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist are injured, and the manager may
feel he has to move for another player, even if only as cover.

PRINCE Naseem Hamed (left) acted the part yesterday after he was
called a clown by his opponent's trainer.
But while the 20-year-old from Sheffield pulled faces at challenger
Armando Castro before his defence of the WBC International
super-bantamweight title in Glasgow's SECC tomorrow night, he still
believes he is the greatest fighter ever produced by Britain.
Castro's trainer, Tony Rivera, had a different view. ''The guy's a
clown,'' he said yesterday as the pair met in Glasgow.
''He should pay some dues before making his outrageous claims. He will
have a rude awakening when he steps up in class.''
Hamed had earlier predicted he would win in five rounds.

WHEN Prince Naseem Hamed defends the World Boxing Council
International super-bantamweight title against Mexico's Armando Castro
at the SECC, Glasgow, tomorrow night, no-one knows what is going to
happen.
The little man from Sheffield says he will wear a kilt; he will cavort
around the ring, maybe do a somersault or two and throw in a bit of a
belly dance.
If, however, the action is anything like the preliminary, when both
camps met up in a Glasgow restaurant yesterday, then the fans are going
to be treated to high-quality entertainment.
Castro spoke only briefly through his trainer, Tony Rivera, but Rivera
had plenty to say. Hamed didn't need anyone to speak for him. In fact,
he and his trainer, Brendan Ingle, were constantly jousting for floor
space. What did come through was a bitter enmity between the camps --
and it came through with all the force of an express train emerging from
a long tunnel.
This was no gimmick, because the venue is now a sell out. It was the
real stuff, and Rivera led the way by launching a scathing attack on
Hamed, the unbeaten 20-year-old who says he is the best fighter ever
produced by Britain, and who believes he can win world titles at three
weights.
''Do I think he is a bit of a clown?'' said Rivera, repeating a
question put to him. ''I think he's a big clown -- an arrogant
loudmouth, who should pay his dues before making some of his outrageous
statements.''
The attack was provoked when Hamed, who also holds the European bantam
title, pointed a finger at Castro and asked Rivera: ''Is he the best
you've got? If he is, I'm going to take out your best in five rounds,
then you can bring someone else over, anybody you like.''
Castro, who has had 38 wins inside the distance from 62 contests, said
through Rivera: ''If he says five rounds, then I will have to knock him
out in four.''
Rivera then asked Hamed: ''Are you going to fight or run on Saturday
night? I know we have come to fight, because Armando never takes a
backward step. If you are going to run, then it will be a bore.''
Enter Brendan Ingle. ''Naz usually has to do the chasing, but if your
man is going to make a fight of it, then I don't go along with Naz's
prediction of a win in five. He's hitting like a heavyweight and I can
see it all over in the first round.''
After the public slanging match, Rivero said: ''I don't think it is
right for a guy who has had just 15 fights -- and 12 of his opponents
were scared of him -- to say the things he does. I mentioned the name,
Antonio Marco Barrera, to him and he didn't even know who I was talking
about.
''It's like he's trying to graduate without going to school. Barrera
is the No.1 challenger among the super-bantams and he would destroy
Hamed.
''This clown says he is the best British fighter, but what has he
done? I believe all this clowning and running about is to cover up
faults. The people who don't know anything about boxing love the
clowning, but those who know the sport feel insulted.
''He is in for a rude awakening when he steps up in class, and it
could be on Saturday night. He's not a Benn or a Eubank. He's just a
youngster who has still to prove himself.''
Meantime, Hamed was unperturbed. He was humming as I passed him. He
grinned and said: ''There's going to be a party on Saturday night. I'm
going to give the Scottish fans a show. I love this place and I want to
be so good that they will ask me back to Glasgow.''

BRITISH interest in the Australian Open Tennis Championships came to
its usual swift end yesterday, when Jeremy Bates failed to cope with
American Patrick McEnroe in the second-round stage at Melbourne's
Flinders Park.
But the Englishman should not feel too bad, because McEnroe is on
something of a roll, having beaten Boris Becker in his previous match.
''That win against Becker made him more confident,'' said Bates. ''It
has not made him invincible with the big points, but he certainly
converted his while I didn't with mine.''
Andre Agassi, the No.2 seed, gave Frenchman Jerome Golmard a brief
taste of centre-court life as he easily moved into the third round with
a straight-sets victory.
The American, in striped shirt and beach shorts, dazzled 207th-ranked
Golmard with his speed and array of shots in a match which lasted just
93 minutes, Agassi winning 6-2, 6-3, 6-1.
Stefan Edberg celebrated his birthday with a straight-sets success
over Adrian Voinea, but there was something of an upset when South
African Wayne Ferreira, seeded No.11, lost in four sets to America's
Aaron Krickstein, while Dutchman Richard Krajicek, the sixteenth seed,
did not last as long, going down 7-6, 6-4, 6-3 against Marcos Ondruska.
In the women's singles, Spanish top seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
continued her swift progress with a straight-sets win over American
Tammi Whitlinger-Jones.
But it was not all plain sailing because Jana Novotna, seeded No.3,
had to recover from the loss of the first set to fellow Czech Helena
Sukova before securing her passage. Sukova, twice an Australian Open
finalist, led briefly in the third set before Novotna, who has now
beaten Sukova in all but one of their five clashes since 1990, took
control of the net.

SOLOMON Wariso, the biochemistry graduate whose wisdom was found
wanting when he was sent home in disgrace from the European Athletic
Championships last year, returns to major competition on Sunday in
Glasgow.
Suspended after failing to spot that mahuang, the illegal Chinese
drug, was an ingredient of pep pills which he had been given by a team
colleague, Wariso has served his three-month ban and will run the 200
metres in the Scottish championships at the Kelvin Hall.
Wariso, who pleaded folly rather than intent to cheat, has a best time
of 20.99sec, making him the fastest entrant, and he hopes to blow away
any lingering whiff of controversy from the Up Your Gas tablets, which
also cost him a Commonwealth Games place.
He was omitted from the UK team to face Russia, announced earlier this
week, but is still intent on international rehabilitation. But a
Scottish title in a fast time could force his way into the British team
which meets France at the Kelvin Hall next month.
A surprise rival will be Geoff Parsons, who declines to contest the
high jump, in which he won his third Commonwealth medal in Victoria. He
says he will do both the 200m and long jump. Should he draw an inside
lane, a likely seeding given his professed best time of 24.00, the sight
of the 6ft 8in Praying Mantis trying to lever his way round the tortuous
Kelvin Hall bends should be a memorable one.
Twelve of Scotland's Commonwealth Games team have entered, including
Tom McKean (800m), Brian Whittle (400m), Jamie Henderson (60m), Stephen
Whyte (shot), Aileen McGillivray (60m), Mel Neef (200m), and Emma
Lindsay (400m).

AT two o'clock this afternoon at Balgray -- the game was switched from
Hughenden because of fears about overnight frost -- Scotland's most
successful rugby team of late, the A team, take on the French in mortal
combat.
Whereas their big team colleagues have prepared for the coming
internationals with the help of Richard Cox, a qualified sports
psychologist who has been, quite literally, concentrating the minds of
Gavin Hastings and company, the A team have been guided by a quiet
lawyer from Edinburgh, David Johnston.
''It's an entirely new group of guys that we are working with, after
so many have been promoted to the senior XV, and therefore we have a
problem with the continuity of players and our established style of
play,'' says the A team coach.
''Only four of the side were involved in the victory over the
Italians. After the game we won against South Africa, Hugh Campbell, the
forwards' coach, and I felt we had to go back a step or two with the
introduction of some new personnel. This time there are so many changes
that we have had to go back to the beginning.''
The A team pack has enough rough and ready citizens to test French
mettle, but avenging last year's 12-9 defeat in Rennes will be hard.
London-Scot Rob Scott, who replaces the injured Andy McDonald, partners
Jeremy Richardson in the second row. Richardson has already publicly
stated that he regards himself as an internationalist through and
through, after his one cap, and has suffered selectorially from the post
South Africa backlash and the fact that selectors are swayed by the last
performance they witness. The last performance of note that they saw was
from Damian Cronin, who has now replaced Richardson in the full side.
In the back row of the pack, wing forwards Fergus Wallace and Ian
Smith, who performed so well at McDiarmid Park, have further cause to
play well, and Stuart Reid at No.8 can use the game to fulfil his rich
potential.
But undoubtedly the greater focus will fall on the A team back
division, containing as it does the potentially lethal centre
combination of Scott Hastings and Ronnie Eriksson. Hastings has been the
model of diplomacy when asked to comment on the fact that he is now
regarded as behind Ian Jardine and Gregor Townsend in the ratings for
the Scotland centre berth.
''Scott has taken it very well, and will be a great asset to our
side,'' said Johnston. ''He certainly appears up for it all right.''
Hastings will bring an air of experience that any A team would be
delighted to have, and you have to suspect that few punters wandering
along to Balgray will have seen his likes often.
The French arrive in Scotland with a team that contains seven full
caps, after wins for their senior side over Canada, New Zealand,
Australia, and South Africa. Aubin Heuber at scrum half is knowing
enough to present problems close to Scotland's scrummage, and despite
Louis Armary's late call-off the presence of Benoit Bellot at stand-off
will provide them with a sound use of possession.
Johnston is aware of the size of the problem posed by the French.
''Take Canada on Saturday, well I think that the French could produce
four A team sides to beat the Canadians,'' said Johnston. ''In the old A
team games there was no contact between us and the French after a match,
but that has all changed now. In recent years there has been much more
communication.
''Last year, the players stayed up late together after the match and
learned from each other. That is partly what these A team games provide,
not only a chance to test our players at the very edge of the
international side, but an opportunity for us to learn and
commmunicate.''
Johnston would undoubtedly exchange the learning process for a win.
''We have a group of players that have been performing well and we are
on a winning run. It would cap a fine weekend.''

THE reason a young Scots second lieutenant was dubbed ''Ten-Inch'' by
fellow Royal Horse Artillery officers was probably because they thought
he was a virgin and should have a nickname to attract the opposite sex,
a High Court judge was told yesterday.
Mr Alastair Green has claimed he was dubbed ''Ten-Inch'' because of
the size of his penis and was bullied and jeered at so much that he
suffered a series of mental breakdowns.
However, Lieutenant-Colonel Nigel Bedford -- one of the officers being
sued for damages by Mr Green -- said the name was given ''in fun and
jest and in no way sarcastically''.
''I am not sure what it referred to but I have a suspicion that,
contrary to the way Mr Green has described it, there was another
reason,'' he told Mr Justice Popplewell.
''In the early days, we believed he was a virgin and that it would be
a good idea if we helped him lose his virginity. At a particular party,
I believe he was given the nickname to make him more attractive to
members of the opposite sex.''
It was all part of the high spirits, practical joking, and
''boisterous fun'' of the 7th RHA officers' mess at Aldershot,
Hampshire, 10 years ago, which Mr Green had enjoyed as much as everyone
else.
''We trained hard and we played hard,'' said Lt-Col Bedford.
Mr Green, now 29 and teaching English in Japan -- where he lives with
his Japanese wife and nine-month-old son -- is suing the Ministry of
Defence and 10 named officers for damages for psychological injuries and
loss of career prospects.
As a 19-year-old, he served only four months of his short service
commission with the regiment -- part of the elite Red Berets airborne
division -- when he was retired because of his first breakdown. He later
failed in his long-term ambition to become a veterinary surgeon.
The hearing continues.

ANKARA: A group calling itself the Lebanon Freedom Fighters repeated a
threat yesterday to kill a US officer and his son missing in Turkey if
Israel did not release a top pro-Iranian guerrilla.
The hunt for Lieutenant Colonel Mike Couillard, 37, and his
10-year-old son Matthew, who went missing last Sunday during a Boy Scout
ski outing, continued yesterday despite heavy snow.
''We have by no means given up hope,'' said a US Embassy official.
An anonymous call by the Lebanese group sought the release of a
Hizbollah-related guerrilla leader known as Abu Ali.

THE six foremost golfers, all among the first eight in the world
rankings, lost no time yesterday in coming to terms with the 7100-yard
Emirates course and taking a grip on the challenge for the Dubai Desert
Classic.
After the first round, Greg Norman, with a 64, eight under par, led by
a stroke from Fred Couples, who in turn was a stroke ahead of Nick
Price.
Ernie Els, last year's winner was on 68 with Scot Colin Montgomerie,
and although Bernhard Langer did not break 70, that score kept him fully
in touch.
On a day of hot sunshine, where a quarter of the field scored in the
60s, these players dropped only three strokes among them over 108 holes,
the culprits being Els with two bogeys and Norman with one.
The headline players did not have matters all their own way. Among the
six on 67 were two young Irish former Walker Cup players, Eojhan
O'Connell and Raymond Burns, winner of last year's Challenge Tour order
of merit, and Pete Baker, obviously eager to restore his reputation
after having slumped last season from seventh to fifty-fifth on the
money list.
Norman likes this course because: ''you have to work the ball from the
tee and the greens look you in the face.'' To prepare, he practised last
week on The Medallist Club's course, which he part owns and has
co-designed with the architect Pete Dye -- a brute of 7400-yards with
the extraordinary rating of 76.8.
Norman will probably best recall two shots for the nine birdies he
made in his fifth successive round here under 70 -- the huge drive at
the 547-yard eighteenth (his ninth) which left him only a No.3-iron for
a 206-yard carry over the pond and the No.5-iron shot he struck from a
bunker 183-yards to 18ft at the ninth, his last, to be home in 30, five
under.
Couples was anxious to make amends for having missed the cut by two
strokes last year, and he could hardly have made a better start.
After only four holes, he knew Norman was eight under, but by then
Couples was already four under -- a very different situation from last
year. Then he began knowing Els was finished at 11 under.
Some tremendous holing out on greens apparently slower than they used
to be gave Couples four birdies and an eagle 3 in his first seven holes,
the last with a No.3-iron to 10ft at the 50-yard thirteenth. As
Montgomerie, one of Couples' partners was later to remark: ''Fred was
something for me to hang on to.''
On that surge, Couples turned in 31, six under. Price, the world's
No.1, took a little longer to make significant progress in his first
competitive round over the course. But as he later put it: ''As the
afternoon progressed, I became more aggressive and the key was my three
successive birdies from the tenth.''
A chip to three feet there and putts of 15ft elevated Price from two
under to five, and he was particularly pleased with the score, since the
tenth was the only one of the four long holes he birdied, and having
missed only two greens, the first and ninth, he saved par at both with
recoveries from awkward places.
Montgomerie felt himself under additional pressure to perform, playing
his first tournament round with his new clubs after six successful years
with another manufacturer.
In halves of 35-33, Montgomerie, in contrast to Price, had birdies at
three of the par fives, and the No.8-iron shot he struck to within a
foot of the hole at the 184-yard fourth suggested that he was rapidly
learning the difference in clubbing values between the new and old
equipment.
Els struggled to the turn in 36, one over, but then hit his stride to
make five birdies on the inward half.
Montgomerie apart, Gary Orr and Adam Hunter on 70, and Stephen
McAllister, a stroke behind, were the other Scottish professionals who
scored under par.
Sam Torrance, one under with seven to play, dropped four strokes for a
75, a stroke ahead of Gordon Brand Junior who, also one under, gave away
five strokes in his last five holes. First round scores (GB and Ire

DEAR Ivan,
It cannot be true, surely. Not you of all people. You have banned the
players from speaking to the press? You have banned YOURSELF from
speaking to the press?
This cannot be the civilised gentleman who entered our little goldfish
bowl in Scotland determined to do things his way, to abandon all those
silly habits gathered over the years by managers in the UK.
There would, you said, be no more managerspeak, none of the
one-game-at-a-time mentality. You wanted to say interesting things, even
outrageous, tongue-in-cheek stuff. And you did, even if occasionally
people took it all a bit too seriously.
You said you would win the cup, the league and, if pushed, I am sure
you would have thrown in the men's singles at Wimbledon.
For some of us, it was wonderful, entertaining, and refreshing.
And it fitted in with your Croatian appreciation of how fortunate
football professionals are. It is a message you have tried hard to get
across to your players, and it worked well enough to inspire them to win
the cup last year.
Maybe it hasn't been the same since and I imagine you will be willing
to put up your hands and take some of the blame.
From all accounts it would appear that you are likely to be departing
this country at the end of the season, but even if this is so you will
be just as determined to leave Dundee United with happy memories as if
you had signed a new four-year contract.
You might even win the cup again but avoiding relegation would appear
to be a priority.
All of this is the kind of thing that happens to managers of teams in
Scotland. Ask Willie Miller further up the coast. Tommy McLean, too,
would tell you what it is like to fight against relegation and win the
cup.
But I am certain the Ivan Golac who breezed into Tayside in the summer
of 1993 would have ridiculed the idea that a manager would prevent
players from speaking to the media, whatever the circumstances.
That Ivan Golac would have insisted that players should be adult
enough to be trusted to behave properly.
And to suggest that he would bar himself from saying what he felt
would have left that Ivan Golac flabbergasted.
So what is it about? Please tell me you have not succumbed to the
don't-trust-any-of-these-people school of thought which occasionally
manifests itself in the breasts of beleaguered managers.
Not the man who liked to take his players a walk in the countryside;
not the man who once told me he was privileged to have been born in the
rock'n roll era; not the man who refused to watch the TV news, lest he
heard of further carnage in his ''beautiful'' Yugoslavia.
Don't tell me you have been consumed by the parochial bitchiness of
the Scottish football scene. We haven't planted one of our spare chips
on your shoulder, have we, Ivan? If so, get rid of it, please. Much
better to be true to yourself. Remember that old Latin saying, something
about not letting the baddies grind you down.
Yours in sport,
Ian Paul.

THE EK Strathmore men's indoor hockey club would not normally move in
the same circles as those giants, MIM and Menzieshill, but five points
from their three matches at the Bells Sports Centre in Perth on Sunday
would make the dream of promotion a reality.
Steve McCurry feels they can ''go all the way.'' His optimism comes in
part from ''the progress our young players like Stuart Carrick and
Alistair Gray have made.''
McCurry also feels that if his side performs well ''they could
surprise both Touche Ross and Morgan.'' But he is not making any
forecast about their opening tussle with Insights Inverleith, since he
thinks ''they are the best team in the play-offs.''
Kerr Thomson, Insights' captain, obviously agrees but he would be more
comfortable if his young star Richard Forsyth had not been required for
a Scottish under-21 training weekend at Largs.
Touche Ross also lose Andrew Balchin, Phil Webster and Mark Ehlen for
the same reason. Fortunately they have a strong core of experienced
internationals.
Form certainly points to Insights and Touche Ross retaining their
places in the top flight.
Scottish women's indoor hockey, meanwhile, have encountered a minor
revolution this season.
Three new clubs became involved in the league and now secretary Helen
Glass is expected to announce that more clubs want to become involved.
This would would allow the new clubs to compete at a level more in
keeping with their standing with a second division being implemented.
This season's new recruits, however, have not been overawed by the
business of such celebrated exponents of the sport, Edinburgh Ladies,
Western Klick Photopoint, Bonagrass Grove, and Hyndland.
Clydesdale are in the semi-finals of the cup and tomorrow at the Bells
Sports Centre, they will start their campaign which could see victory in
the league's Pool B.
Royal High Gymnasts, with their recruits from Heriot Watt University,
should run them close.
Edinburgh Ladies with three of their top players, Pauline Robertson,
Diane Renilson, and Janet Jack, in San Diego with the Great Britain
squad, have requested and received a postponement to their match in Pool
B with Menzieshill.

NICK Faldo, who had to put on his waterproofs to avoid getting
drenched in an icy mountain stream, nevertheless scored a solid 70 on
the 6942-yard, par-71 Starrpass course in the first round of the $1.25m
Northern Telecom Open in bright sunshine here in Arizona yesterday.
This card left the 37-year-old former Open and US Masters champion
five behind the early leaders, Phil Mickelson and veteran Tom Purtzer.
''I holed nothing longer than six feet on the greens but I was quite
pleased with the rest of my game,'' said Faldo, who now plays three
rounds on the 7148-yard, par-72 National course to complete his debut as
a full US Tour member.
After missing a birdie nine-footer on the first green, Faldo pulled
his drive at the 427-yard second hole and his ball ran down into a small
creek.
''It was lying in half-an-inch of water and I don't know what made me
have a go at it,'' Faldo said after donning waterproofs and hammering
the No.6 iron just short of the green. He chipped stiff.
He sank a six-footer for the only birdie of his first nine after a
fine wedge shot at the 502-yard third and got out in 35.
He holed several six-footers to save pars on his second half on which
his only birdie came with a four-footer at the thirteenth, but he
dropped a shot at the last. Early scores (Americans unless stated):
65 -- P Mickelson, T Purtzer.
66 -- H Twitty.
67 -- P Goydos, D Hammond, J D Blake, L Wadkins, P Stankowski.
68 -- J Ozaki (Japan), R Cochran, D Forsman, C Beck, W Austin, R
Mediate, B Henninger, R Fehr, J Gallagher.
Other scores included: 70 -- N Faldo (Britain). 71 -- C Parry
(Australia), J Parnevik (Sweden).75 -- I Baker-Finch (Australia). 79 --
J Daly. 81 -- D Feherty (N Ireland).
* AUSTRALIAN Mike Clayton fired a seven-under-par 65 yesterday to take

Zwartkop Country Club course in the opening round of the #100,000 ICL
International in Verwoerdburg, South Africa today, to lie joint fifth,
two shots behind leader Nico van Rensburg.

NICK Faldo, despite being in some icy mountain water early on, made a
solid, if unspectacular, start to his first round as a new US Tour
player here in sunny Arizona yesterday. The 37-year-old former Open and
US Masters champion reached the turn in one-under-par 35 on the
6942-yard, par-71 Starrpass in the opening round of the $1.25m Northern
Telecom Open.
Like the rest of the 156-strong field, which includes another Open
Champion, Mark Calcavecchia, as well as Australians Ian Baker-Finch and
Craig Parry, Faldo plays one of his two qualifying rounds at Starrpass
and then the other three on the 7148-yard par-72 National Course 35
miles away across this prosperous city in the old Wild West.
The Briton who intends to play in 17 American events between now and
the PGA Championship in Los Angeles in August, had little chance because
of Tuesday's icy rainstorm to study the intricacies of Starrpass. ''The
weather was diabolical and I had only a glimpse of it, but it looks
straightfoward enough,'' said Faldo whose object in coming over here is
to try recapture his world No.1 form.
He could hardly have been presented with a more awkward course on
which to make his debut than here with its ravines, cacti, and scrub
full of road-runners, coyotes, and jack rabbits.
After missing a birdie nine footer at his opening hole -- the tenth --
Faldo pulled his drive slightly at the 427-yard eleventh and his ball
ran down into a shallow creek. Donning his blue rain gear, Faldo
splashed it out just short of the green and chipped stiff from 20 yards
to save par.
At the 502-yard twelfth he wedged up to six feet and this time read
the borrow correctly and holed out. He held on to his card with six more
straight pars.
Phil Mickelsen was among early leaders.

<RECORDNO>980271268</RECORDNO>

THE slaughtering industry in the UK is likely to be the one sector of
the food chain to gain from greatly reduced levels of live exports to
the Continent.
For several years, many abattoirs have been struggling to achieve
sufficient throughput to cover costs and, indeed, there has been a major
rationalisation of plants, with only the very best surviving.
The players in the industry have become noticeably fewer, as seen by
the withdrawal from the sector of Hillsdown Holdings, who sold their
Edinburgh plant to Scotch Premier Meats -- part of the ANM Group.
Even more recently, the Grampian Country Food group acquired McIntosh
Donald, who operate plants at Portlethen and in Anglesey. However, there
are more premises for sale than buyers, with the multi-national Vestey
organisation trying to dispose of their British Beef plants at Hawick,
Peterborough, Preston, and Wakefield.
These abattoirs comply fully with EU regulations, but so far have
failed to attract any serious interest. The Hawick unit can handle large
numbers of both cattle and sheep, which should make it an attractive
proposition -- lying as it does in the heart of a major livestock
breeding and feeding area on both sides of the Border.
Without doubt, abattoirs everywhere will be busier in the coming
months than for several years. The Meat and Livestock Commission are
predicting a massive reduction in live sheep exports, suggesting that
last year's total of 1.8 million head will be cut to a likely maximum of
no more than 800,000 --possibly less, if the pressure to end the trade
is maintained.
However, what may be of greater importance to farmers is the prices
they will receive for this year's lamb crop. Numbers will probably be
higher than last year, when the hill sector suffered badly at lambing
time. But at the same time, consumption of lamb is at best static, and
still slipping in Scotland.
The greatest imponderable remains whether the traditional markets for
live exports in France, Spain, and Italy, will be willing to take
British lamb in carcase form. One trade source, who wished to remain
anonymous, commented: ''Some of them might, but it will be at their
price.
''More likely, I suspect, is that they will switch to importing lamb
from eastern Europe. There are huge numbers of sheep in some of these
countries, and they are desperate for foreign exchange. Price is often
more important to the trade than quality.''

GOVERNMENT moves to cut down or privatise the State veterinary service
were described by a leading representative of the veterinary profession
yesterday as creating a volcano, and waiting for it to erupt.
Vets pointed out that it raised the threat of animal disease imports,
reduced welfare on farms, and encouraged the re-emergence of
tuberculosis as a threat to man and animal.
''The Government is trying to cut costs in this area, and to do this
would fundamentally undermine our ability to react adequately to any
future ingress of disease into this country,'' Bob Stevenson, BVA vice
president, told a London news conference.

HOWDEN Group hopes a #5.8m purchase announced yesterday will boost its
sales of compressors to the petrochemical industry and the company
remains firmly on the acquisition trail.
The Renfrew engineering group will pay #4m in cash for French company
Burton Corblin and its Pennsylvania-based associate company, and a
further #1.8m for surplus cash.
Only last week, the company reiterated its strategy of growth through
acquisition, as it reported a 12% increase in interim pre-tax profits to
#10.6m.
Howden reckons its latest addition, which should not result in any
significant reorganisation, will give it a synergy in the compressors
market.
The operations of Burton Corblin, one of the market leaders in the
manufacture of reciprocating or distant compressors, are complementary
to those of Howden Compressors in Glasgow, the market leader in screw
compressors.
Director of corporate services Alan Maclachlan said: ''It is a
different type of compressor but they are very much used in the same
sort of business and we hope that one will feed off the other to expand
our interests, particularly in the petrochemical industry.''

DESPITE continued sluggishness in the housing market and intense price
competition Carpetright is managing to profitably grow its business and
its market share. In the 26 weeks to October 29, sales rose by 28% to
#64.7m and profit before tax increased by 46% to just under #8.1m.
Excluding new store openings sales grew by 4%.
Chairman and chief executive Sir Philip Harris said the results were
good against the backdrop of a 10% decline in the overall market for UK
carpets in the past year and the very hot summer. Customer service,
price, and breadth of product range were cited by Sir Philip as the
reasons for the company's outperformance. The group's buying power
enables it to undercut its competitors, the majority of whom are small
local independent retailers.
Carpetright's target customers are in middle to lower socio-economic
groups. As such its customers' preference have not switched to
alternative floorcoverings such as wooden floors, ceramic tiles, and
sisal matting, as has happened at the top end of the market. Carpetright
is actually experiencing good demand for its more expensive heavyweight
Saxony carpets in the premier range which are imported from the US but
still offer good value relative to the competition.
Carpetright continues to be very strong financially with cash in the
balance sheet of #19.2m. However, Sir Philip has no intention of
repeating his past mistakes and was keen to emphasis that he had no
plans to make any acquisitions and that attention would continue to be
focused on growing net margins and market share in the UK.
The company is well on the way to achieving its target of opening 250
stores and achieving 20% market share within the next two years. Net
margins improved in the period under review from 10.4% to 11.9%. Its
market share has risen steadily from 6% at the time of flotation in May
1993 to around 12% today.
Sales growth in the first half was aided by the opening of 18 stores
taking the group total to 163. This has since risen to 173 and the
year-end total is expected to reach 183 stores. Carpetright may end up
trading from some former Texas Homecare sites if Sainsbury's Homebase
launches a bid for its rival.
Confidence in the future of Northern Ireland was demonstrated by the
decision to open four stores in what is new territory for Carpetright.
Sir Philip sees scope for a total of 10 stores in Northern Ireland,
trading profitably alongside firms like Dixons and B &amp; Q.
It will face little competition in Northern Ireland. Capital
expenditure for the full year is forecast to be #6.5m which can be
comfortably financed from internal resources.
The interim dividend was raised by a generous 44% in line with
earnings growth to 3.9p. Current trading is said to be satisfactory with
some price inflation starting to creep into the market. This should
enable Carpetright to comfortably exceed last year's annual profits of
#14.1m.
City analysts were impressed by Carpetright's performance and upgraded
their annual profit forecasts to around #22m. The shares added 10p to
255p.

ATTEMPTS by animal rights protesters to block live calf exports were
inadvertently helping fox hunts feed their hounds, it was revealed
yesterday, as Britain's leading veterinary surgeons accused them of
hitting the wrong target.
Paul DeVile, president of the British Veterinary Association, said
that calf carcases from lorries held up at Shoreham had ended up as feed
for hounds at a hunt near Winchester. Delays and stress caused by the
protesters had increased the onset of disease and death in the animals.
Bob Young, immediate past president, told a London news conference
there was some concern at the action of well-meaning people at the
ports. ''They have certainly raised the problem up the political agenda,
but we do feel they may be causing some suffering to those calves and
lambs in transit. The activities of the protesters mean that journeys
may last days instead of hours, and hundreds of animals have in fact
been treated for disease associated with confinement and stress
following these prolonged journeys.
''The same problem may arise if farmers are unable to sell their
calves, or provide adequate facilities to house and look after the
number of calves left on their units. This is surely not the result that
the protesters would wish to promote''.
Mr Young confirmed that BVA policy was to stop unnecessarily long
journeys by livestock, and to ensure slaughter at as near the point of
production as possible. To this end, he accepted the protesters had been
successful in lobbying for more political attention.
''But we would suggest that demonstrators should also be lobbying and
demonstrating in some way in terms of 'buy British' and 'don't buy
foreign meat' -- and diversifying their powers of persuasion other than
at the ports. They should write to their MPs, and I think they should
stop lying down in front of lorries.''
Francis Anthony, chairman of the association's animal welfare group,
said the BVA was against the transport of live calves destined for
production systems banned in this country, and the hypocrisy of imports
of veal from countries operating the crate production system. Germany
and Denmark had banned the system, about half of Dutch production still
used the system, and Austria was expected to ban it soon.
Charles Frank, of the BVA's Veterinary Policy Group, went on to urge
protesters to picket ports of arrival on the Continent. At the moment,
they were only preaching to the converted in Britain. They needed to do
more to attract media attention in those countries still operating veal
crate systems.

THE move towards a completely free market in UK electricity supply by
1998 gathered pace yesterday with the announcement that co-ordinating
groups are to be formed to anticipate the likely problems on route.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, said the
groups would involve his own office, the power companies, consumer
bodies, and other interested parties on both sides of the Border.
Separate, but parallel, co-ordinating panels were needed because the
two Scottish power companies covered generation, distribution, and
supply, while the English set-up was split between generation and a host
of regional supply companies.
The first tasks of the groups will be to establish the key issues,
review the timetable, and identify responsibilities. Pilot schemes
allowing outside suppliers to compete in each of the regions will begin
before 1998 to test procedures.
Professor Littlechild, summed up the aims as to:
* protect the interests of all customers and encourage new entrants
during the transition to fully effective competition.
* be cost-effective and in particular minimise costs and inconvenience
to customers seeking second-tier supply.
* be capable of satisfactory implementation by 1998.
''I have asked the (English electricity) Pool and Scottish power
companies to report to me by the end of April on appropriate trading
arrangements with an indicative timetable for implementation,'' he said.

BTR has bowed to increasing City criticism of its policy of recruiting
its executives internally and yesterday silenced its detractors with the
proposed appointment of RTZ deputy chief executive Ian Strachan as chief
executive to follow Alan Jackson.
Mr Jackson will be 60 in March 1996. Mr Strachan, 51, will become an
executive director in April and will spend three months touring the
conglomerate's global activities and then become managing director in
July before succeeding Mr Jackson in January next year.
He is highly regarded in the City as an approachable and competent
manager and excellent at communication -- something which has been
lacking at BTR in recent years and helped undermine it share price
performance.
It was inevitable that Mr Strachan would leave RTZ in due course as he
was pipped for the post as chief executive of the world's largest mining
company by Robert Wilson in 1991. Mr Wilson is only sx months older and
so there is no scope for his reaching the top position.
It was thought that he would have been a candidate to become chief
executive of Barclays where Courtaulds Textiles' Martin Taylor was
appointed last year.
He joined RTZ as finance director in 1987 and was, paradoxically,
succeeded in that position by Christopher Bull who came from BTR.
Earlier, he had worked his way up through the ranks at Exxon after a
year's teaching political science at Harvard University.
BTR will also have to appoint a new chairman to succeed Norman Ireland
in May next year.
The company said the nomination committee decided that Mr Strachan
should be supported by a UK-based chairman capable of a reasonable
period of tenure -- Mr Ireland will have been chairman for just three
years when he goes.
Also, two additional non-executives will be recruited to maintain the
balance of UK based directors. Mr Jackson, an Australian, is staying on
in a non-executive role.

VETERAN property developer John Ritblat has won the battle for
Broadgate, having secured the agreement of the banks to his plan to bid
for Stanhope Properties which will result in them being repaid 82% of
their loans.
Stanhope owns half of the prestigious Broadgate development on the
north eastern fringes of the City of London and has first refusal on the
other half which is in the hands of the receiver of Rosehaugh,
Stanhope's original partner in the complex.
Mr Ritblat's British Land acquired just under 30% of Stanhope almost a
year ago and began a campaign to win the banks over to his plan. He
faced competition from rival proposals from the PosTel pension fund
which had proposed to repay most of the banks' debt through
recapitalising Stanhope.
There was reportedly a third idea from Stanhope's chief executive
Stuart Lipton involving a new backer. Recently, there have been rumours
that Hammerson was taking an interest in the situation.
Now Stanhope chairman Stanley Honeyman declares: ''Following an
extended period of negotiation over the last 18 months the (British
Land) offer represents the most desirable course of action for
shareholders and creditors at this time. I therefore unreservedly
recommend all shareholders to accept.''
Mr Ritblat is offering 3p per Stanhope share and will repay #122m to
the banks, which had #148m outstanding.
He is said to be ''flexible'' as regards the Rosehaugh receiver's half
share in Broadgate and negotiations are continuing. However, the
receiver, Roger Oldfield of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, is not keen
to sell the holding, arguing that he would rather hold on for a recovery
in property values.
Ideally KPMG would have liked to combine the shareholdings under one
receiver as it believes it could then have got the best price for the
whole development.

BRITAIN'S sweet tooth is growing all the time but consumers are
trading down to lower priced items, a trend seen elsewhere in the food
market. . This was bad news for Thorntons, the confectionery
manufacturer which operates at the quality end of the market.
Its underlying sales fell by 1.2% in its UK retail and franchise
business in the four week run-up to Christmas compared with a strong
period last year. The prolonged hot summer also depressed demand for its
products although there was a noticeable upturn in demand in the autumn.
Commercial sales to companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer and sales in its
continuing business in France were maintained at #11.3m and #2.2m
respectively. Total group sales in the 28 weeks to 7 January were 2%
higher than last year at #57.6m.
The French business was rationalised a couple of years ago and should
make a profit in the current financial year. Along with Christmas,
Easter is a key trading period for Thorntons and so it is too early to
predict the outcome for the full year.

MARY Archer is to leave the board of Anglia Television next month.
A political row erupted last year after it was disclosed that Lord
Archer had placed an order for Anglia shares the day after she attended
a board meeting at which a #292m takeover bid for the company was
discussed.
The shares were bought on behalf of a Kurdish businessman, who made a
profit of #80,000 after they shot up in value when the bid by media
group MAI became public knowledge.
Lord Archer was investigated for alleged insider dealing by Department
of Trade and Industry inspectors, but President of the Board of Trade
Michael Heseltine said no action would be taken against the ex-Tory
deputy chairman.
The minister declined to publish the inspectors' report despite
pressure from the Opposition.
Lord Archer expressed ''deep regret'' that he had caused needless
embarrassment to his wife, a scientist at Cambridge University, who is a
non-executive director at Anglian.
Lady Archer, 50, maintained she had not told her husband about the
takeover bid in advance and he insisted he had not benefited from the
share dealing.
A spokesman for Norwich-based Anglia, which is now part of MAI, said:
''Early in December, Dr Mary Archer advised David McCall, the chairman
of Anglia Television, that she wished to retire from Anglia after the
February board meeting, by which time she would have served eight years
as a non-executive director.''
Lady Archer is a former member of the council at the Lloyd's insurance
market and was chairman until the end of last year of the hardship
committee which helps investors in financial difficulties.

A RESEARCHER working for Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown approached
Tory MP Phil Gallie (Ayr), asking for information on directors of
privatised power companies.
The approach was made on the basis of Mr Gallie's membership of the
Electrical Power Engineers' Association. The researcher appeared not to
realise he was also a Tory MP.
Mr Gallie said: ''He advised me of a statement Gordon Brown is
planning to make next Tuesday besmirching directors of power companies
but acknowldeged that he couldn't find the real dirt.''
The MP raised the matter in the Commons criticising the ''furtive,''
manner of the approach, but did send a message back to the researcher.
It ran: ''The dirt is on Ayr beach where Labour controlled Strathclyde
Regional Council has failed to provide adequate sewage disposal.''

THE Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest with 1.8 million
borrowers and 12 million savers, duly led the way yesterday in lifting
mortgage rates.
The standard rate rises by 0.25 points to 8.35% with immediate effect
for new borrowers and from February 1 for existing borrowers. The
Halifax was followed by Nationwide, which raised its standard rate by
0.3 to 8.44%.
Other societies signalling they would be following suit include the
Woolwich and Bradford and Bingley. However, the Abbey National bank, the
second largest supplier of home loans, said it was disappointed by the
decision and was reluctant to raise rates. But managing director Charles
Toner added that with 10 million investors, Abbey had to remain
competitive with rivals.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, says it is holding
its mortgage rate at 8.1%. C &amp; G's chief executive Andrew Longhurst
said, ''We want to do our best for our borrowers. We see no reason to
increase our mortgage rate at the present time.'' Two others, the
Northern Rock and Birmingham Midshires, last month raised their rates to
8.54% and 8.56% respectively.
Details of increased rates for savers with the Halifax will be
effective from February 1 and will be announced nearer the time.
Mike Blackburn, chief executive of the Halifax, commented, ''An
increase in mortgage rates became necessary following the rise in bank
base rates last month. By limiting the increase to 0.25%, we hope to
minimise the impact on our borrowers and on the housing market
generally.''
Fears that the rate increases would be a further blow to the
confidence of a still delciate housing market were dismissed by Rob
Thomas, housing market analyst at securities house UBS. ''Rates are
still lower than they were a couple of years ago,'' he said.
For savers, who substantially outnumber borrowers, though some people
do both with a society, the hardening of rates, if only marginally, will
be welcomed. Their income has suffered badly in recent years because of
low interest levels and many have opted for alternative investments,
sometimes with added risk and involving tying the money up for a
specific period, to try and raise their income.
The Halifax rise, meantime, will increase payments on a typical
#50,000 repayment mortgage by just over #6 a month.

FOR the third time this week, the economic indicators have caught City
economists on the hop. Yesterday the surprise came from a very strong
set of retail sales figures for December.
On top of earlier evidence of inflation gathering momentum at both the
factory gate and retail levels the sales figures suggest that the
economy is in danger of over-heating.
Hopes that the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, would
stay his hand on interest rates when he next meets the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, on February 2 could well turn out to have
been misplaced.
James Capel's Adam Cole took the view that it would be a very risky
strategy to wait until March after the volume of sales grew by a
seasonally adjusted 0.5% last month against City expectations of a 0.3%
advance.
The year-on-year growth rate jumped from 2.6% in November to 3.8%, the
same as it had been in July. The value figures were even more
disconcerting.
Average weekly sales of #4010m (not seasonally adjusted) were 6.5%
higher than in December of 1993, a sharp rise from 3.5% in both October
and November. It was the biggest year-on-year value increase since
November 1991.
Retail sales figures have been erratic in recent months. When shops
cut their prices sales rose, and when the discounts ended they fell. But
that picture went out the window in December when both sales and prices
rose.
Prices of household goods and clothing and footwear rose sharply in
November. At the time, economists speculated that the increases would
not stick or sales would slump.
In the event sales picked up in the face of further price increases.
Evidence is beginning to build up that the disinflationary pressures
which had been operating in the High Streets are ending.
Household goods prices rose by 1% in November and a further 0.6% in
December. Yet this is the area of retail activity sporting the strongest
growth rates.
In the final quarter of last year, household goods sales were 1.8%
higher than in the third quarter and 5.9% above the fourth quarter of
1993, suggesting that the replacement cycle is becoming a powerful
influence in a market otherwise starved by a low level of housing
transactions.
The comparable figures for all retailers were 0.5% and 3.2%
respectively.
Clothing and footwear sales, which had fallen away in October and
November, jumped by 1.9% last month. Over the quarter as a whole they
grew by 0.3% and were 3.2% higher than in the fourth quarter of the
previous year.
The weakness of clothing and footwear sales and the flat trend in all
sales in October and November are seen to have been largely
weather-related.
The mild weather in October and November also hit demand for energy
which is a major component of industrial production. Economists expect
some easing in the quarterly growth rate when the Central Statistical
Office publishes its first estimate for the fourth quarter on Monday.
After the 0.8% rate achieved in the third quarter City analysts are
mainly forecasting 0.6% or 0.7% for the final quarter, but with weather
the dominant influence evidence that the pace of economic activity is
already slowing is likely to be pretty thin on the ground.
The strength of retail sales last month comes after a couple of years
when sales fell in December in the face of anecdotal evidence to the
contrary and then bounced back in January.
This led City analysts to question the large seasonal adjustment used
in the December figures, especially in the other non-food sector, which
includes chemists, tobacconists, and off-licences. Once again sales in
this sector fell in December by 1.1% for a quarter-on-quarter decline of
0.9% and fourth-quarter on fourth-quarter drop of 2.1%.
Sales growth elsewhere was evidently strong enough to offset this
comfortably. Food retailers in particular have enjoyed a good year with
sales in the final quarter 4.3% higher than in the same quarter of the
previous year.
Some analysts were reluctant to draw too many conclusions until the
figures on inflation and retail sales for January, traditionally a time
of heavy discounting on the High Street, become available.
The Retail Consortium said that October and November had shown weaker
sales and since Christmas the trading pattern had again been tough.
''There is no sign of conditions to justify a further interest rate
rise,'' the consortium director-general, James May, argued.
Retailers are worried about the effect of this week's mortgage
increase on the housing market, but the Bank of England may be inclined
to focus on the fact that building societies are only passing on half
the December rise in base rates to their mortgage customers.
The big risk lies in ignoring the signs of inflationary pressures
building up in the economy. This week's batch of indicators suggests
inflation is not the dead duck many had thought.

PROFITS at TSB Bank Scotland have fallen for the first time since
flotation eight years ago, in stark contrast to a two-thirds earnings
surge announced last week by the TSB nationally.
Chief executive Alastair Dempster yesterday admitted his
disappointment that profits had slipped. The Scottish operation
previously enjoyed rising earnings every year since the TSB Group was
floated in 1987, riding out the turbulence which hit other banks.
In spite of a #203m hike in pre-tax profits to #504m for the TSB Group
as a whole, the Edinburgh-based subsidiary reported a 4% fall in pre-tax
profits to #79.1m for the year ended October.
However, a reduction of #162m in bad debt provisions was largely
responsible for what were, on the face of it, glowing figures from the
TSB Group nationally. With the Scottish arm primarily focusing on the
domestic market, it did not enjoy the benefits reaped from the dramatic
improvement in the commercial bad debt position.
Pressures on interest margins in a fiercely competitive market-place,
reflected by a reduced return on capital, were the main factors behind
the disappointing bottom-line figure.
With the ''feel good'' factor still lacking, banks are having to cut
their margins to entice far from confident borrowers, a factor
highlighted by NatWest Securities analyst Stephen Kirk, who said: ''All
the banks are competing very aggressively for whatever business there
is.''
TSB's Scottish operation, in line with national policy, has also been
encouraging savers to transfer into higher interest accounts. Good
growth in volumes has been achieved and TSB Bank Scotland believes it
will reap the dividends of customer loyalty in the long-term.
Mr Dempster said: ''At the height of the recession, we were able to
continue to enjoy growth in profitability. These things can't go on
forever. I am a little bit disappointed that it has dipped slightly this
year but I think it is perfectly understandable.''
However, he added that costs were well under control and that, backed
by a solid customer base, TSB Bank Scotland would be well positioned to
move forward when the economy improved.
In line with the group nationally, the Scottish operation achieved an
encouraging 20% increase in its mortgage book to #1800m. Total net
customer advances were up nearly 9% on the previous financial year, at
#2365m.
However, TSB Bank Scotland's key cost-income ratio, which had fallen
dramatically from 64% six years ago, went back up by nearly 3% to 54.1%.
Operating profits dropped 10.2% to #88.1m.
* Meanwhile, the TSB predicts that the cost of buying a home in
Scotland will leap by 13% this year.
The bank attributes 95% of the forecast rise to increased taxes, with
the rate of mortgage interest tax relief to be cut to 15% in April, and
higher interest rates.
Averaging 27 industry predictions, the TSB forecasts a 3.4% rise in
house prices during 1995 and claims that, for the first time in three
years, a mortgage will eat up one-third of a typical adult's take-home
pay.

Stuart Trotter describes John Major's new tactics
''TREASON doth never prosper,'' a wag wisely once said. ''For if it
prospers none dare call it treason.''The whipless Tories look to be in
an increasingly prosperous condition for, when yesterday Mr Tony Blair
pointed out to their putative leader that eight of them had issued what
amounted to a separate party manifesto, Mr Major declined to take a
strong line with them but decided it was wiser to take a strong line
with Mr Blair instead.
''Do we take it you are not going to repudiate their views?'' asked
the Labour leader, affecting shock. Mr Major sought support below the
Opposition gangway, where lie in wait Mr Dennis Skinner and a few others
who still think of Europe as a den of capitalist vice rather than the
home of born-again socialists, and pointed out that Labour has its
dissidents too.
Having exhausted this possibility, Mr Major then looked for support to
the sturdy figure of Labour's deputy leader, Mr John Prescott. His
latest line of attack on Mr Blair is that the Labour leader is a sort of
butterfly figure who cannot make up his mind and constantly changes his
policies. ''I don't know whether he claims to have changed them or
whether he just parked them in the usual spot and they magically
disappeared,'' he mused.
This reworking of the story of Mr Prescott's clamped car reduced the
more sycophantic backbenchers to tears. Conservative Central Office
appears to have borrowed a couple of sit-com scriptwriters to sprinkle
Mr Major's material with topical jokes. If the next election goes the
way the polls suggest, he Major and his soapbox could become a regular
turn on the club circuit.
Devolution has, apparently permanently, entered the Tory armoury. Mrs
Jacqui Lait suggested that a quid pro quo for a Scottish Parliament
would be to reduce Scotland's 72 MPs to the 45 we got in 1707. Mr Major
admitted he was tempted.
After he departed, Mr Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, answered
the West Lothian Question to a sadly sparse audience but to the great
delight of Commons Leader, Tony Newton. Scottish and Welsh MPs, if
allowed to settle matters for their own countries, asserted Mr Flynn,
would gladly forgo the right to do so for the rest of the country.
''Very interesting,'' purred Mr Newton. ''Do run that one past Mr
Blair.'' Admittedly at the moment the next Parliament looks as if it
could consist of 620 Labour MPs, 10 Tories and a few others. But if
normality returns the Flynn solution could result in the delightfully
Gilbertian situation in which Mr Blair, with a UK majority, could be
Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs, etc, on Mondays and Tuesdays, and Mr
Major or Mr Heseltine or someone could be Tory Prime Minister, with an
English majority, on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It would be great fun and
provide a weekly switch in perspective for us all.

DEVOLUTION again took centre stage at Westminster yesterday as the
Prime Minister renewed his assault on Labour's plans.
In noisy exchanges, he sought to embarrass the Opposition by
dismissing the scheme in the words of Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook.
Mr Major told the House: ''After devolution, the position of Scottish
MPs would be untenable. It would be wrong for those from Scotland to
interfere in English domestic affairs after that watershed had been
reached.'' As Labour began to protest, he added: ''The quotes I have
just used are from Robin Cook.''
The Prime Minister was responding to Tory MP Jacqui Lait, who claimed
that, under devolution, the number of MPs from Scotland would have to be
cut from 72 to the 45 set out in the 1707 Treaty of Union.
Earlier, Labour rounded on Mr Major over his latest attack on the
establishment of a Scottish parliament, in which he claimed devolution
could cost Scots #6 a week.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson denounced the assertion as
''invented rubbish,'' and said: ''Nobody believes the Tories on tax. A
Scottish parliament will make the bureaucracy more efficient and
democratic, not more expensive.''
Mr Robertson yesterday issued a dossier of quotes on devolution made
over the years by Tory MPs. He said: ''John Major forgets that the
Tories promised a legislative Scottish Assembly in their 1974 manifesto.
There was no mention of the West Lothian question then.''
Hitting back, Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart wrote to Mr
Robertson, challenging him on Labour's policy on quangos. He demanded an
estimated cost for the Scottish parliament and a list and cost of the
quangos Labour proposes,to abolish.
Mr Stewart said: ''Day in and day out Labour continue to make
statements and promises they fail to back up with hard facts. I am
giving George Robertson the opportunity to justify his comments.
However, I do not hold out much hope of receiving the answers to the
questions I have put to him. He should know better than to expect the
Scottish people to respond favourably to a false bill of goods.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Scottish leader Jim Wallace said on Channel
4: ''The real break up of the United Kingdom is threatened not by
Scottish or Welsh self government, but by the blinkered Unionist
obstinacy which Mr Major has voiced all too clearly in recent days.
''I believe the majority of my fellow Scots value the bonds which the
Union has forged -- the ties of kinship and friendship, the sharing of a
common history and heritage. Liberal Democrats believe these bonds are
strong enough to withstand a maturing of our constitutional
arrangements.''
The SNP said that the other Opposition parties were fobbing off
Scotland, trying to offer a British solution to a British problem,
instead of a Scottish solution to a Scottish problem. Spokesman Andrew
Welsh said: ''The true divide is between independence and Unionism and I
believe that scares the Labour Party.''

SNP LEADER Alex Salmond last night attacked North-east Tory MPs
Raymond Robertson and George Kynoch, following their support for the
Government in Wednesday night's vote on fisheries.
Mr Salmond told a Westminster news conference: ''They are two of the
biggest bootlickers in the House of Commons.''
Last night, Mr Kynoch (Kincardine and Deeside) said: ''Mr Salmond is
obviously becoming extremely rattled. I do not intend to respond to the
personal comments he has made.
''He is obviously not aware that most of the fishermen resident in my
constituency fish in the North Sea. There has been no access permitted
for the Spanish in the North Sea.
''What Mr Salmond finds difficult to accept is that the Government
went into difficult negotiations in which the Spanish expected to get at
least 200 boats into the Irish box area and only succeeded in getting
40.
''The deal was very much better than any negotiator from any of the
Opposition parties would have achieved.''
Mr Robertson said: ''Mr Salmond's immature, schoolboy politics do not
appeal to the people of Aberdeen.
''Given the fact that the Government fought hard and won to ensure
that no Spanish fishermen were allowed into the vital fisheries of the
North-east, it was in the interests of the people of North-east Scotland
that I supported the Government in the division lobbies.''

LABOUR'S former leader Neil Kinnock yesterday stepped down as an MP
after 25 years.
He set in motion the formal resignation procedure as he prepared to
take up his new post as EU Transport commissioner.
The move will cause a by-election in the rock-solid South Wales Labour
seat of Islwyn, which Mr Kinnock held at the last election with a 24,728
majority.
Mr Kinnock spoke with pride yesterday of his long service to the
people of Islwyn.
He said in a statement from Brussels: ''I only wish that I could have
ensured that they had the benefit of the Labour Government that so many
people of Islwyn voted for.''
Mr Kinnock said he was looking forward to taking up his new
#140,000-a-year brief in Brussels -- where he will join hiswife Glenys,
now a Euro-MP.

THE Government refused yesterday to confirm reports that it plans to
introduce fresh legislation to fundamentally overhaul the Child Support
Agency, following persistent criticism by MPs and a damning report on
its work by the Parliamentary Ombudsman, Mr William Reid, published
yesterday.
Answering Liberal Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood Roxburgh and
Berwickshire), Leader of the Commons Tony Newton would say only that
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley will be replying soon to
criticism of the CSA by the Commons Select Committee on Social Security,
and the response would go further than the MPs' report calling for
sweeping changes in the CSA's operations.
Shadow Leader of the House Ann Taylor said Mr Lilley should apologise
to the House for the shortcomings of the CSA in the light of the
Ombudsman's report.

Tchaikovsky Symphony No 6, Leningrad Phil/Mravinsky
(DG Classikon)
* THIS is a belter. On form nobody ever generated a more appropriate
intensity in Tchaikovsky's neurosis-drenched music than the late, great
Evgeny Mravinsky, and no great orchestra more white heat than
Mravinsky's Leningrad Philharmonic.
This version was recorded in London in 1961. But be not ageist. It
shows not its years, and scorches like it was recorded yesterday. At a
little over #8, it comes into the mid-price category, and, coupled with
the Berlin Phil's 1972 recording of Swan Lake Suite is worth every
rouble.
A welcome addition to Deutsche Grammophon's Library of Great Classics
and a superb follow up to Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker and a sensational
account of the Fifth Symphony, in the same series and with the same
forces.
If you haven't got it, get it.
Let's Be Buddies, George Masso and Dan Barrett
(Arbors Jazz)
* A DOUBLE helping of trombones from Masso and Barrett, both on top
form throughout a lovely selection of little-played/unfamiliar tunes.
Stylistically different, their rapport is evident, especially during
their exchanges on the jaunty Miss Annabelle Lee.
Both please most in yearning mode on the achingly romantic How About
Me?; the wistful Am I Blue? and Linger In My Arms A Little Longer Baby
-- a number which highlights their versatility by featuring Masso's
pianistic skills and Barrett's vocal and cornet talents.
Back Home Again, Lee Wiley
(Audiophile ACD-300)
* AN excellent investment for Wiley devotees and newcomers alike, this
CD includes Wiley's by-then age/gin-soaked vocals on the 1971 recording
session which proved to be her last.
In the illustrious company of Dick Hyman (piano), Rusty Dedrick
(trumpet) and Bucky Pizzarelli (guitar), she produced 12 superb tracks,
among them a beautifully breezy Moon River; a stomping good New
Orleans-style Indiana and her own 1940s hit, Any Time, Any Day,
Anywhere.
Die-hard Wiley enthusiasts (count me in) will further delight in the
six previously unissued duets with pianoman Joe Bushkin and the seven
outtakes of the singer in rehearsal.
Unmissable.
Gaining Ground, Highland Connection (Greentrax)
* ROSS-SHIRE-based Highland Connection merge tradition with 1990s
social comment on a first album that opens with an immediately
ear-catching, vigorous set of tunes which proves a tough act to follow.
In Ian Hardie they have an excellent fiddler and tunesmith, and in
Janice Clark a robust upholder of the North East ballad style, but songs
such as Losing Ground show a tendency towards over-arrangement which
detracts from their good intentions.
* Home Entertainment will appear in Weekender from next Saturday.

LORD Cowdray, the multi-millionaire landowner and former chairman of
the Pearson group of companies, which includes the Financial Times,
Penguin Books, and Madame Tussauds, died yesterday aged 84, his West
Sussex estate said.
He died at King Edward VII Hospital in Midhurst, from bronchial
pneumonia attributed to cancer of the bladder.
In 1994, Lord Cowdray had an estimated #700m fortune.
His 17,000-acre estate at Midhurst includes the Cowdray Park polo
grounds. He also owned 60,000 acres in Scotland.
The viscount was chairman of Pearson from 1954 to 1977 and, with him
at the helm, the group was transformed from a private family business
with pre-tax profits of less than #1m into a public company valued at
#3.2bn in 1994.
A statement from Pearson yesterday said Lord Cowdray would be
remembered for keeping the group's ''fundamental values close to those
of the family business begun more than a century earlier''.
These included a commitment to ''combining the warmth and
manageability of small-scale businesses with the benefits and financial
advantages of a larger group''.
The seeds of the Pearson empire were sown by Lord Cowdray's
grandfather, Weetman Pearson, whose projects included the construction
of Dover Harbour and the East River tunnel in New York.
Lord Cowdray accumulated a wide range of companies for the Pearson
Group and was described last year by BusinessAge magazine as ''one of
the nation's great post-war corporate adventurers''.
Born in Midhurst in 1910, Lord Cowdray succeeded his father in 1933.
During the Second World War, he served as a captain in the Sussex
Yeomanry, losing an arm at Dunkirk.
The viscount is survived by a son and two daughters by his widow, Lady
Cowdray, and a son and two daughters by his first wife, Lady Anne
Bridgeman, whom he divorced in 1950.

David Belcher shoots the bull with Glasgow's own Cowboy Mouth recently
rounded up by a Munich outfit for the big drive to staardom, yep.
THEY perceive Scottish music differently in Munich, and we should be
grateful for that. ''I think they have a romantic notion of maverick
minstrels . . . they see us all as sad Glasgow singers singing sad
songs, bathed in pathos -- which is, of course, completely accurate,''
says Douglas MacIntyre with a paradoxically perky and self-mocking grin.
''What was it that that German review said about our album?'' inquires
Douglas's Cowboy Mouth co-partner, Grahame Skinner. ''It was something
like 'Music for guys in the dark hours when only other guys called Jimmy
or Jack can help.' It was quite touching to read. Geezer
confession-time: I think that's how they look on our music.''
Douglas chimes in to express his hope that the reviewer meant Jimmy
Beam and Jack Palance, and not Jimmy Krankie and Jack Milroy. Aye,
seriously funny and funnily serious are Douglas and Grahame about their
new roles in Cowboy Mouth, the third Glasgow band to be signed to a
Munich-based label, Marina, run by Stefan Kassel and Frank Lahnemann,
two enthusiastic journalists who are determined to see Scottish
musicians at their best.
Of course, prophets tend to go without ''porridge in their ain
kail-yaird'' and all that: some folk in Glasgow might find it difficult
to see beyond Douglas and Grahame's respective pasts. Douglas has been
Mr Ubiqitous Fret-Fingers with a trillion bands, most notably with the
recently deceased Love and Money, as well as piloting his own label,
Creeping Bent, while Grahame's epic tones first achieved world-wide
chart prominence with pop-funksters Hipsway in the late eighties.
One album and three singles having failed to achieve similar success
for his next band, Witness, Grahame withdrew from a form of music-making
that had become a slow and ultimately painful process. ''Creating
records should be enjoyable, but it becomes difficult when, due to
record company release-schedules, you're having to take a year to record
an album, and then a year out to promote it, followed by a year to make
another . . . it becomes very precious and you miss out on so much.''
Consequently, Grahame draws much quiet pride from the fact that Cowboy
Mouth's album, Life As A Dog, was recorded live in a studio in Busby in
three days for #800, using the first 10 songs the duo had written
together inside two days.
''They're not bad songs,'' says Grahame, ''but they may not be the 10
best songs we'll ever write -- in fact we've already written the same
number for our next LP, and we'll probably end up having 40 songs to
choose from by the time we come to record it.
''But we're as proud of our dumb songs as we are of our emotive songs.
And listen to the Velvet Underground's third LP. After Hours is dumb,
and Candy Says is really emotive, but they're both good.''
Velvets' references don't tell the whole Cowboy Mouth story, however.
''We're still into them and Television, but Glen Campbell and Jimmy
Webb, too,'' says Douglas. ''And we've been raiding our mums' record
collections for all those melodic country-based albums that every
parental Glasgow music-centre had; that we were brought up on and then
rejected.''
So how does Life As A Dog sound? Understated; grown-up; resigned;
intelligent; sensitive. At its best, it showcases songs of much, woozy
2am charm. Its worst isn't much less than its best, but there are some
songs which have maybe been left a little too unformed and throwaway --
and while you know that a song which rhymes ''body'' with ''Kirkcaldy''
is meant to be dumb, there's still dubiety over whether it's bad-dumb or
good-dumb.
But surely it is always better to try for that which seems beyond
one's grasp. ''Neil Young states our artistic credo on Rust Never
Sleeps: you have to stretch to achieve things. We're not into perfection
and safety. When we started the album, we didn't know we could do it --
but we did.''
Helped by the Marina instrumental collective, not least drummer Gordon
Wilson and guitarist Mick Slaven. As well as playing with Cowboy Mouth,
the Wilson-Slaven axis play with Marina's two other bands, the Bathers,
led by Chris Thomson, and Sugartown, featuring Gwen Stewart . . . and
Douglas MacIntyre.
All three Marina combos should be sharing Glasgow and London bills --
''in refined, seated venues, still to be confirmed'' -- early in March.
''I think Marina have a talented roster,'' says Douglas. ''And we're
like the Stax house band . . . Booker T and the MGs -- which means that
I'm Steve Cropper,'' says Douglas, displaying palpable scepticism.
Grahame ponders. ''So I'm Otis Redding!''
No, laddies, no. You've achieved something that's better than
pretending to be someone else . . . you're yourselves. You're Grahame
Skinner and Douglas MacIntyre, and you're Cowboy Mouth. And you out
there in Heraldland should check them out.
* Life As A Dog is released on January 31.

JAPANESE conductor Takuo Yuasa has taken over the Royal SNO's concerts
this week from the absent Walter Weller. The programme -- an all-Mozart
affair drawn from compositions written in 1791, the composer's last year
-- remains unchanged and is repeated tonight at the Usher Hall.
With Yuasa the orchestra produced an interesting mix of performances:
primary observation has to be that the general standard of Mozart
playing (no hiding place here) from the band has risen over recent
years. That said, there were scrappy moments in The Magic Flute
Overture.
In total contrast, the orchestra, with principal clarinettist John
Cushing as soloist, produced an account of the Clarinet Concerto that
was smooth, sustained, and exquisitely lyrical. This was a beautiful
performance from Cushing, creamy and flowing, no extroversion, nothing
showy, and characterised (by everyone) with an intimacy that was
redolent of chamber music.
The second half performance of the Requiem was itself a curious mix.
The balance between the orchestra and the Royal SNO chorus was largely
superb. The interpretation for the most part had a cool neutrality about
it. It was neither earth-shaking nor heaven-storming. Within this there
was much to admire, especially some of the choral articulation (for
example in the Kyrie: brilliantly clear, unforced, and naturally
accumulating).
Then again there was at times a swing to another extreme, with Yuasa,
in the Lacrimosa, becoming so expressive that the results were almost
pictorial. Soloists Lynda Russell, Fiona Janes, Horst Laubenthal, and
Stafford Dean were, with the exception of the last named, better in
ensemble than apart.

THE SCO last night dipped a toe -- or what sounded more like a
centipedal quantity of feet -- into the lapping waters of Michael
Nyman's film music. But what suited Prospero's Books, from which the two
pieces derived, does not necessarily suit a concert hall, and what
looked on paper like an ingeniously devised programme foundered on the
rhythmic inertia of Nyman's brand of musical minimalism.
With Vivaldi's tiny triple concerto, La Tempesta di Mare, as its
starting point, and with Stravinsky's Danses Concertantes providing
essential proof of what rhythm is all about, there was no doubt about
the ingenuity, even if Nyman -- along with the programme note that
hailed him as a second Shakespeare -- was rather sabotaged as a result.
But the ecstatic exuberance John Harle brought to the Saxophone
Concerto at least kept the first of Nyman's two pieces pulsating like a
fragment of neo-Sibelius. Entitled Where the Bee Dances, this was
certainly sweet and sticky, but it did build up a momentum -- by way of
a long, increasingly note-packed crescendo -- which the premiere of the
suite from Prospero's Books conspicuously lacked.
This, for the most part, sounded like an accompaniment in search of a
soloist, and the crudity of the SCO's performance did it no favours. But
then, having just celebrated Stravinsky's genius in a jerky, quirky
account of a work that retains its inspired unpredictability, who could
blame Ivor Bolton and his players? The concert will be repeated in
Glasgow tonight.

EVERY good comedian knows that the best gags are those the seeds of
which have been planted early. There's nothing funnier than stumbling
across an unexpected punchline 60 minutes after the lead-up.
One of the remarkable things about Ken Campbell -- a man about whom
there are many remarkable things -- is his ability to plant joke after
joke in the first half only to reap the comic rewards in the second.
Campbell is a master of the digression. For every sentence there is a
tangent, for every tangent a meander. It boggles the mind to think about
the complexity of his monologue's structure. And that's neatly
appropriate on this, his latest visit to Edinburgh, with a show that is
all about the current scientific supposition that there is a near
infinite number of parallel universes.
His material is a fascinating mix between the scientifically proven
and the plain ridiculous. His skill is to disguise which one is which.
And for all his chatter about talking dogs or seventeenth-century
computer terminals, the really loopy thing about Ken Campbell is the way
his loops loop right back to a converging point as if to prove that
there is order in his universe after all.
It's a show that will make you laugh a lot -- his proof that
Shakespeare was a dwarf is the funniest routine I have seen in months --
and surprisingly it will make you think a lot.
The truly unsettling thought is that if his quantum theories are
correct, then in neighbouring universes there are millions upon millions
of Ken Campbells with theories one step weirder each time.

<HEADLINE>Judge ends Parker Bowles' marriage</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980271296</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CAMILLA Parker Bowles's 21-year marriage ended in a three-minute
ceremony in a small, bare courtroom yesterday.
Senior district Judge Gerald Angel set the legal seal to her divorce
from husband Andrew by pronouncing decree nisi at the hearing in the
Principal Registry of the Family Division at Somerset House, London.
The divorce -- prompting speculation about a future marriage between
the Prince of Wales and Mrs Parker Bowles -- was reduced to a name third
from last in a list of 32 cases read out by the court clerk.
There was silence when Judge Angel asked: ''Does any party or persons
wish to show cause against the decrees being announced?''
He continued: ''I pronounce decrees and make orders in accordance with
the respective district judges' certificates.''
The brief ceremony happens every day in the court and yesterday was
witnessed only by 10 journalists.
Neither party nor their lawyers are required to be present.
The decree absolute is due to be announced in six weeks.
Their divorce, announced last week, comes after they had lived
separate lives for two years.
Mr Parker Bowles, 55, and his wife, 47, stressed they decided to
divorce jointly and without acrimony.
According to papers at the court, Mrs Parker Bowles began proceedings
and was the one to make the formal move of petitioning.
The couple have two children -- Tom, 20, a student at Oxford, and
Laura, 16.
The split came as the Prince of Wales's personal valet Ken Stronach --
under royal investigation over newspaper revelations -- broke cover
yesterday as his future remained in the balance.
Mr Stronach, 50, has lain low since the publication of details of the
affair between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles appeared at the
weekend.
The strain of the past few days showed on the face of the senior valet
as he left his home in Kennington, south London.
Grim-faced, he remained silent as he got into a car and was driven
away.
Mr Stronach was questioned with a solicitor present by the prince's
private secretary, Commander Richard Aylard, about his role in the
revelations.
He has been suspended on full pay pending the investigation.

IT has become known as the grumbling appendix of the NHS. No, not the
organ allegedly removed from a patient by a mere nurse, but the office
of the health service Ombudsman, which has been operating successfully
since 1973.
The Ombudsman, William Reid, has the same powers as a high court judge
to investigate the grievances of patients and their relatives. In
practice, the highest he goes is to a Commons select committee of MPs
who monitor his work.
This week the Ombudsman select committee reached the final stage of
its annual ritual. This was to grill NHS chief executives from Scotland
and England about the action they have taken to put right the blunders
revealed by the Ombudsman.
The agenda ranged from broad policy on long-term care of the elderly
to the case of a distressed wife who was kept waiting in vain for hours
at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to see a doctor about her dying husband. On
long-term care, the answer is to be more NHS beds in nursing homes.
As for the woman kept waiting at Aberdeen, the MPs were told that the
shame has reverberated through the NHS north and south of Border and
that the lessons have been learned. One MP, noting that hospital staff
must have seen the woman waiting so long, said it would never have
happened in a supermarket. He is probably right. It is a point missed by
those who complain that the new-style NHS is being run like a
supermarket. Better, perhaps, that it were.
Meanwhile, more evidence comes this week of the medical profession
cleaning out its stable. This is the process of weeding out doctors who
don't make the grade. The public admission that there are such beings as
bad doctors has produced in the profession a frenzy of activity to do
something about it. Forthcoming legislation -- the dud doctors Bill --
will give the General Medical Council extra powers to discipline
incompetent doctors.
I return to this topic because a Government working party of doctors
and health chiefs has just proposed by-passing the statutory process in
favour of taking summary action against a particular tribe of doctors
whom it suspects are not up to the job. The doctors in question are
travelling hospital locums who fill in when the regular doctors are
absent. Demand for locums is rising because junior doctors are working
fewer hours. The trouble is that the worst among these freelance locums
flit from one hospital to another before their mistakes catch up with
them. There is concern for the safety of patients, says the new report.
Now the game may be up for lazy locums. The working party suggests not
only a code of conduct to keep them in line, but that it should be
rigorously enforced by measures more draconian than anything in the
pending legislation. For example, it recommends compiling a blacklist of
unsatisfactory locums, feeding in turn a computerised alert system to
warn hospitals about who is on it. To reinforce the blacklist, the
report suggests that the safeguards of the Data Protection Act should be
removed from such doctors.
In addition, hospital locums would have to carry an official log-book
with consecutively numbered entries so as to keep track of them and
prevent the dubious practice of leapfrogging to conceal their bad
episodes. Considering that doctors have recently accused the NHS of
Stalinism, in respect of gagging clauses in consultants' contracts, it
seems remarkable that their leaders can happily sanction such devices as
blacklists, log-books and, eventually, electronic surveillance of
hospital locums. It looks like another symptom of their new
self-critical attitude.
And since the profession feels that way, the Government's stance is
changing too. Health Ministers are now emboldened to welcome ideas from
which they previously recoiled. Take the example of a doctors'
blacklist. For years the Ombudsman committee has been frustrated because
offending doctors have moved and cannot be traced. The MPs wanted to
keep tabs on them by means of a national register where their mistakes
would be recorded -- that is, a blacklist.
The Government flatly refused. Such a register, it said, would be
difficult to keep up to date, would be unreliable and, above all, would
cost money -- #500,000 just to get it going. Nearly 10 years later, a
blacklist is back on the agenda. Walls are crumbling.
The medical profession has long been accused of erecting barriers for
its own protection and to the detriment of patients. If this new
approach is a sign of barriers coming down it is time to cheer,
especially since the paramount aim is to protect patients from low-grade
locums -- or even bogus doctors stalking the wards.

MAYBE I'm just from the shallow end of the gene pool, but it was the
quotes in Men's Health that got me cringing. ''Imagine if Woody Allen
was depressed and taking this medicine -- some of his movies might have
been upbeat,'' said a doc promoting Prozac. What!
''I've never had a problem with erectile function, and I don't plan to
have one, because I'm doing something about it,'' said an American
urologist.
Even Sugar Ray Leonard handed out chestnuts: ''My old neighbourhood
was kind of notorious for sucker-punches. If you could spot one coming,
you were at a mighty advantage. Here's how not to be a sucker.''
But the winner on a wing and a prayer was the actual intro to a
feature -- I kid you not, entitled: How to win a dogfight. ''You never
know when you are going to find yourself in air-to-air combat these
days.'' How to win a dogfight? That's handy for the next time I'm
conscripted into the air force and strapped in a Harrier jump-jet
without training -- but I'll be fine -- I've got my dog-eared copy of
Men's Health.
You begin to think that any magazine which includes articles on
air-to-air combat and sucker punches should be re-titled Real Men's
Health, and a visit to their office would reveal no drinks machine.
''Some testosterone or adrenalin, sir?''
This flippant attitude to the serious subject of men's health is, of
course, encouraged by the magazine. In the article entitled Low Ways To
Win Any Argument, it recommends continually restating your opponent's
argument in grossly over-simplified terms.
A cartoon illustrates another way to win. As a purple-faced person
rants, his opponent pushes his fingers into his ears and chants: ''La,
la, la, can't hear what you're saying.'' In a way, it's what I'm doing
with words. Men's health is a killer.
Men live, on average, six years less than women, we suffer more heart
attacks and lung cancer -- and we're more prone to accidents. In 1992,
men totalled 93% of Aids sufferers and 75% of suicides. We seldom have
health checks.
In this respect, Men's Health is badly needed. It's special agenda for
the subject contains a detailed description of an examination for
testicular cancer and encourages men to receive regular blood pressure
and sexual health checks. However, despite discussing men's lack of
knowledge about the prostate, it never informs us.
It does properly target failed health education. Boys at school are
taught nothing about their bodies -- except when not to touch them. But,
on the subject of sex, the magazine is rather predictable with a feature
on office affairs and bolstering libido.
The target audience appears to be affluent thirty-something men who
worry about seducing the nanny. But, while Men's Health does feature
articles missing from GQ and Esquire, it may be preaching to the
converted.

Recent studies have raised serious questions about the adequacy of
most indoor lighting and how it affects health. Here ANN SHAW reports on
one woman's ordeal -- and how enlightened employers are taking action to
ease the plight of workers thanks to a system than can turn a dreich
winter day outside into a sunny summer afternoon indoors.
YOU'VE spent the day at the office and you feel drained. You blame the
VDU or the central heating, but the real cuplrit could be the
fluorescent lighting.
For ordinary office lighting lacks the intensity of full-spectrum
lighting, which imitates natural daylight. And there is increasing
evidence that, if we work constantly under artificial lighting, then not
only do we feel below par, but our work performance, stress levels,
intelligence, and mood, and even our bones can be affected.
More than 50 companies in Scotland, ranging from multinationals to
small businesses have installed full-spectrum lighting. All recognise
the importance of providing the correct lighting for their staff.
So what are these lights like? I visited Cruachem, makers of
artificial DNA, based in the West of Scotland Science Park, and was
taken aback by the intensity of the lights. Nothing had prepared me for
their sheer brightness. It was like stepping into a sunny summer day,
even though outside it was late afternoon on a dreich winter day.
What about the cost? It is around two to three times that of an
ordinary fluorescent tube. ''But we consider it worthwhile,'' says
Robert Hutchinson, Cruachem production director. He reckons that so far
they have spent #800 on full-spectrum lighting -- ''that represents a
reasonable investment for improving the quality of the working
environment''. (The tubes have an average lifespan of three times that
of an ordinary light.)
''I had never heard of full spectrum lighting,'' says 33-year-old
Frances Hendren, who works as a production assistant. ''We thought at
first that it was far too bright and we would never get used to it, or
that we would get headaches.''
To everyone's surprise, they found that after a few hours their eyes
were adjusted to the extra-bright lights. Frances lists the benefits:
''We seem to have lots more energy. We don't get tired the way you do
under ordinary fluorescent light. Yes, at first it seems a cold light.
But in reality it makes the room warmer and easier to work in.
''My job is repetitive but I don't feel so tired or bored at the end
of the day now.''
The importance of light is only now being recognised, although winter
depression or SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) is already accepted as a
medical condition brought about by a hormonal imbalance, triggered off
by the absence of daylight, in susceptible individuals. A Canadian study
found that by putting full spectrum lighting into classrooms it improved
academic achievement, attendance, growth, and actually lessened tooth
decay.
This study of 327 children in five suburbs near Edmonton in Alberta
was carried out by psychologist Dr Warren Hathaway over a two-year
period, and its findings were presented last year to the American
Psychological Society.
Says Dr Hathway: ''Lighting systems are designed more for electrical
efficiency than their physiological or psychological effects on people,
and that may turn out to be a mistake.''
Recent studies raise serious questions about the adequacy of most
indoor lighting and especially about energy-saving lights that greatly
distort the natural spectrum of the sun. We don't need much light to
see, but we do need a far more intense light to affect the production of
melatonin secretion, the hormone that triggers hibernation in animals,
and the body's circadian rhythms.
At the turn of the century, 75% of people worked outdoors. Today that
figure has dropped to fewer than 10%. We can't turn the clock back, but
we can use technology to imitate natural daylight.
CASE HISTORY
It's simple for some
MAUREEN Campbell from Greenock suffers from Seasonal Affective
Disorder (SAD), or winter depression. As soon as the days shorten, she
becomes lethargic, finds it an effort to get out of bed in the morning,
and her craving for sweets shoots up, yet her mood sinks. When March
arrives, she perks up again. But life has changed for the better, thanks
to a lightbox.
''Every morning over breakfast, while doing my crossword, I switch on
the lightbox in the kitchen. It's amazing. I never thought something so
simple as light would help. Later in the day I give myself another
booster -- it's so simple.''
Basically, Maureen says, the lightbox helps her to cope. ''Before, it
was an effort to get out of bed in the morning to do the housework. I
read about light therapy but I couldn't believe that something so simple
would work. I spoke about it to my GP who agreed that I could be
suffering from SAD but she had no experience of anyone using a lightbox.
Because it's drug-free she agreed there was no harm in me trying it out.
''I had an arrangement with the company that if I didn't like it they
would take it back after 21 days, although they told me they had never
known anyone return a lightbox. I have a 10,000-lux box, costing #125.
After a few days, I felt the difference. No way would I part with it.''
Lightbox, a Glasgow-based company, has sold more than 300 to
sufferers.
FACT FILE
* Winter depression, or Seasonal Affective Disorder, affects about 10%
of the population. Symptoms range from fatigue, depression, sleep
problems, lethargy, overeating, loss of libido, and mood changes, to
increased appetite, weight gain, often with a craving for sweets,
biscuits, and chocolates.
* The cause is believed to be light deprivation. Darkness produces a
hormone called melatonin which causes drowsiness. But another hormone,
serotonin, has also been implicated, along with circadian rhythms.
* Treatment is light therapy, sitting in front of a special light box
for one to two hours a day. Improvements can be expected within five
days but must be continued throughout the winter season.
* Light boxes cost from around #100 to over #200 depending on size.

THE number of homeless people in Scotland could increase to more than
180,000 within the next five years unless the Government and local
authorities meet three key demands, it was claimed yesterday.
A group which is drawing up a Homeless Persons' Charter for Scotland
maintained that, although official figures showed that 43,500 people
applied to councils for help last year because they were homeless, the
number was probably more than 90,000 and could double by the end of the
century.
The charter, which will be formalised later this year, will demand:
* That more money be spent on housing.
* That benefits for young people be restored.
* That staff at hostels receive appropriate training.
The group, which was formed after a meeting of 250 homeless people in
Glasgow in October, has set out a detailed, reasoned case for its aims
and will lobby the Government, local authorities, housing associations,
MPs, and benefits agencies.
Mr John McGovern, a former homeless person from Glasgow and a
spokesman for the group, which is being assisted by the Scottish Council
for Single Homeless, said yesterday: ''Homelessness is a growing problem
and it is going to have to be addressed. The official figures are just
the tip of the iceberg.
''The money being spent on keeping people in bed and breakfast and
hostel accommodation can amount to #300 or #400 a week, and would be far
better spent on proper housing.
''In addition, we want young people to have their benefits restored.
The lack of benefits actually causes homelessness because more and more
young people are being thrown out of their family homes because their
parents can't afford to keep them.
''We also believe that staff at hostels, who are called care officers
but are not properly trained, should have appropriate qualifications so
that they can help residents prepare for life when they leave the hostel
and can help those with physical and mental health problems.''
The group will hold a policy conference in East Kilbride on February
14.

A conference in Glasgow was told yesterday that there would be no
let-up in the Government's crusade to increase home ownership. The
Scottish Housing Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said the target
was 60% ownership by the end of this Parliament. After that, he hoped
the figure would continue to rise as the year 2000 approached.
Government policies, including right-to-buy and rent-to-mortgage
schemes, had raised the level of ownership in Scotland from 35% in 1979
to 55.3% now, he told the Council of Mortage Lenders' Scottish
conference.
Lord James insisted that the Government also saw an important and
continuing role for the public rented sector.
Another speaker, Sir James Mellon, chairman of Scottish Homes, called
on banks and building societies to see an investment opportunity in
Scottish housing worth #1000m over the next five years.
He said a huge private lending investment was needed to support the
housing agency's activities between now and the end of the century.
A number of banks and building societies were already taking advantage
of the opportunities but it was in the interest of the financial sector
as a whole to realise how big this field would be.
Lenders had many opportunities to support ventures which were well
managed, asset backed, and carrying minimal risk, said Sir James.

Re Dr Johnman's letter on the proposed closure of Rutherglen Maternity
and consequent need for Rutherglen folk to travel to the Southern
General (January 18).
Over the past month I have been visiting a relative in the Royal
Infirmary. The journey is short and straightforward compared to that
between Rutherglen and the Southern General. Nevertheless, because of
the vagaries and unreliability of public transport, I must leave home at
around 6.40pm for visiting hour starting at 7.30pm. I usually return
home home shortly after 9.15pm. This assumes some good luck in catching
buses.
I would anticipate having to increase travelling time by at least 50%
for the journey to the Southern General. The bus fares I estimate at #3
return minimum. The actual outcome will, of course, be that many
expectant mothers, their partners, and relatives from lower income
groups and therefore dependent on public transport, will be deterred
from attendance at the hospital. Hence the health board erodes another
support from under another vulnerable family group.
Dr Johnman asks if the public no longer protests. The reply may be
found at a public protest meeting tonight at 7.30pm in St Columbkills
Church Hall, Rutherglen.

Alastair Ritchie quite correctly states that BT should have an
emergency standby service on public holidays, like other utilities
(January 14). In fact BT did have a skeleton staff available on January
2 and 3 to handle emergency work, such as doctors' lines, kidney
patients, and coastguards. Other faults were attended to where possible.
The letter does not make clear whether this particular telephone
account fell into the emergency category. However, it should be borne in
mind that any BT customer who is housebound and living alone may be able
to register for the BT priority fault repair scheme. This guarantees
24-hour cover at no extra cost. For further details and an application
form phone 150 (free call).

Barclay McBain writes on the lack of posts for new teachers (January
11). I would like to mention the lack of ''supply'' teaching posts for
new teachers.
My daughter qualified with an honours degree in physical education in
June, 1993, and got some ''supply'' works during 1993/94. Since the
schools returned in August, 1994, she has not had one single day
''supply'' teaching from Strathclyde region. This begs the question --
when, if ever, will she get a full-time post?
It is time the ''supply and demand'' question was seriously looked at.
What is the point of training people to become teachers if there is no
hope of a position at the end of it?
It seems unfair to let four years of studying and hard work go to
waste.

Professor Steve Bruce's article was deeply perceptive about the much
lamented lack of a ''feel-good factor'' (January 12). However, this can
be blamed to a large degree on much more prosaic factors than those
described.
We in the West have watched over the past 20 years our cars becoming
more pleasant to drive, more reliable and, in real terms, cheaper. We
know who is responsible for these improvements and we know it hasn't
been our motor industry.
Gradually every consumer and every worker has been made aware that
people on the other side of the world view the process of making things
in a very different way from that in which we do, and moreover they view
work in a very different way.
The lack of a ''feel-good factor'' lies in the fact that everyone from
Alf Young to the average school-leaver knows that there are hundreds of
millions of Taiwanese, Koreans, Chinese, and Eastern Europeans willing
to do more work, do it better, and do it for less. The question is only
when they will get the chance.
Our response has been a fatalistic one. Children cannot be bothered to
get an education when it is presented to them. Their parents cannot be
bothered to make them. We seem paralysed.
I am an employer. Before Christmas, a busy period for us, I asked a 17
year old who works part-time for us to recruit some friends to help out.
He asked 20 friends, all at an above-average comprehensive in Glasgow.
All declined.
When I asked him why he told me that they all needed the money, they
all had plans for the summer, but none wanted to give up their leisure
time. They had more important things to do.
Perhaps we don't feel good, because we feel good enough. There is only
room left for self-disgust.

So yet another building firm, Glasgow-based Toffolo Jackson, has been
forced into receivership and the immediate jobs of 180 people threatened
(January 17).
According to the report this situation has arisen as a direct result
of the current working practices adopted by main contractors: namely,
secure contracts at cost, or minus cost, and then screw down on the
subcontractors by any means, fair or foul, in an effort to make a
profit.
As with the larger Lilley collapse two years ago, there will be
ramifications of this collapse with suppliers and subcontractors to
Toffolo Jackson all being affected.
While the Government, through the DTI, has deferred considering taking
action on the question of late payment for two years, the hopes of the
subcontractors in the industry must lie with Sir Michael Latham and that
the proposals, as outlined in his report Constructing a Team, are indeed
implemented.
The changing face of the employment practices in the construction
industry has resulted in the main contractors employing very few
personnel, and so minimising their risk, and engaging subcontractors to
undertake the work -- and the risk.
The result is that main contractors, having secured a contract on a
very thin to imaginary profit margin, can then only make profits if they
screw their subcontractors and suppliers. In this situation everyone but
the main contractor loses.

ADMIRERS of Douglas Hurd -- and there must still be a few -- will have
been heartened by the old charmer's recent performances. Deploying what
we might call the Sarajevo Gambit, Britannia's cuddly lion has been
shaking his silvery mane, whispering his dismay, and pleading with our
allies to do nothing whatever about the pre-meditated obliteration of
yet another city.
It's a wicked old world, in Dougie's book, and any number of things
are highly regrettable out there. But you must be realistic, mustn't
you? Our man Hurd has been a fan of Boris Yeltsin since the rosy-nosed
reformer first clambered to prominence, and he is not about to quit now.
Democracy is at stake.
Others are equally stalwart. In Bonn yesterday Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said he was proud to be Yeltsin's friend. The bombing of civilians was
dreadful, just dreadful, but any idea that the Chancellor was standing
aside while the carnage went on was a calumny. Thus, Helmut on Boris:
''What a pitiful sort of man I would be if one of my friends had
difficulties and I refused to support him.''
The European Union, not to be outdone, has also taken a tough line.
In a ''Declaration by the Presidency'', issued yesterday, it said that
the union ''is following the continuing fighting in Chechnya with the
greatest concern'', adding that it deplores -- it really does -- ''the
large number of victims and the suffering being inflicted on the
civilian population.''
Nevertheless, the EU called for a settlement ''which respects the
territorial integrity of the Russian Federation'', neatly echoing the
line taken by the White House since last December, and parroted in
Geneva earlier in the week by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
who for his part was ''reassured'' after meeting the Russian Foreign
Minister, Andrei Kozyrev.
The latter promised that while Grozny is being flattened Moscow will,
of course, allow humanitarian aid. In due course, after the place has
been totally levelled (along with any potential political opponents),
there will be ''free elections''. In return, Kozyrev gets what he
wanted: an assurance that billions of dollars in US aid will continue to
flow and democracy, Russian-style, will continue to thrive.
At this point, some people might be remembering the Cold War, evil
empires, and the triumph of double-entry book-keeping over atheistic
State Socialism. They might even ask where, precisely, lies the
difference between a Soviet empire expending 13,000 soldier's lives in
Afghanistan, and a Russia empire squandering troops in the Caucasus?
Defending the shoots of democracy wherever they spring is one thing;
defending Western investments is obviously quite another.
None of which is to suggest that there is much to be said for
Chechnya, or its leader, General Dzhokhar Dudayev former Soviet bomber
pilot and xenophobe. Before the war his oil-rich statelet of barely one
million people was best known for its gangsters, its guns, and its
aversion to law and order. But if Dudayev is a thug -- witness his
threat to launch terrorist strikes against Russian nuclear power
stations -- what is Yeltsin?
Before letting his generals loose, the president was doing his best to
destabilise Chechnya by fair means or foul. He it was who encouraged
Ruslan Khasbulatov, the ethnic Chechen and erstwhile leader of the
violent rebellion against Yeltsin himself, to rebel, in turn, against
Dudayev.
Otherwise he was consoling one Umar Avturkhanov, chairman of the
Chechen opposition ''Interim Council'' with 10 billion roubles of
support -- much of which has since found its free-market way to the
''commercial wing'' of the Russian army.
But since we are discussing democracy, let us not forget the detail
that Chechnya is part of Russia only through imperial conquest and that
the Chechens have never accepted their incorporation. Yeltsin has sent
tanks into that scrap of land not to protect ethnic Russians (many of
whom are dying), still less to defend freedom, but to shore up his
empire. This is not normally defined as democracy.
Since 1991 Russia has carved out a federal system granting 20
republics substantial powers of self-government. In a census conducted
in 1989, however, Soviet officials identified more than 400 separate
ethnic groups. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union those groups have
become more than a little disenchanted with Russian rule. Each month,
fewer of them send taxes to Moscow; each month, secessionist movements
spring up.
But what should the West make of our leaders' determination to ensure
the survival of Boris? What does he offer in this ''strategic
partnership''? The CIA ranks the smuggling of fissile material from
former Soviet republics as one of the biggest security threats the
United States faces; the strategic nuclear cuts contained in the START
II treaty are in trouble with nationalists in the Russian Duma; the
Russian military is lobbying to get out of conventional-force limits
imposed by the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty; and the recent
Chemical Weapons Convention is endangered by Yeltsin's inability -- or
unwillingness -- to end biological and chemical warfare programs.
What New World Order?
Throughout the Chechen crisis, Moscow has insisted it remains loyal to
''reform'', the latest pledge coming on Wednesday from Yeltsin himself.
He has reason: the IMF currently has a team in the Russian capital
studying the budget, reviewing Russia's reform record, and considering
whether to grant the $6 billion loan Russia is counting on. Hence the
West's vested interest in Russian ''territorial integrity''.
Democracy has, needless to say, already worked wonders: inflation was
up in December to 16%; production was down 21%; prices increased
three-fold last year; and there are numerous of vital industries in deep
trouble. It is in situations like these that drunks start wars and
become dictators.
Last August Yeltsin warned that invading Chechnya would ''bring on
such tumult and so much blood that they will never forgive us.'' Now he
says the army will mop up ''within days.'' Three cheers for democracy --
or for Douglas Hurd -- anyone?

Your editorial (The whistle-blower, January 12) correctly supports the
public service action of ScotRail director Chris Green, who has
forthrightly exposed the inevitable curtailment of our network given a
continuation of current anti-rail Government prejudice (January 12).
Despite the bumbling and expensive ineptitude of the railway
privatisation force, we in Scotland are at least fortunate in now having
a really committed railway professional at the top who is not prepared
obligingly to fudge the consequences of those silent railway saboteurs
in Whitehall and the Scottish Office.
Our own Secretary of State for Scotland, despite his conspicuous
silence and overt disdain towards ScotRail, does actually have extensive
Section 56 Transport Act powers to assist capital investment projects
which would give us a modern, more competitive, efficient railway
carrying more passengers with lower levels of government/local authority
subsidy.
Electrification of the Scottish Intercity triangle linking
Glasgow-Edinburgh-Dundee-Aberdeen, realisation of ScotRail's Dornoch
Bridge route to Caithness, Glasgow/Edinburgh Airport rail links, and
short reopenings or new routes embracing Edinburgh's suburban circle,
Alloa, Grangemouth, Kirkintilloch, Larkhall, Leven, Renfrew, East
Kilbride (Town Centre), and St Andrews are legitimate candidates for
implementation before AD 2000.
Their total investment is only a tiny fraction of envisaged Scottish
Office road and new motorway expenditure over the same period.
Willingness to approve a range of those long overdue rail improvements
throughout Scotland is the only way the Secretary of State can lift the
stench of electoral deception and the claim that his Government really
believes in a better future for our railways.

THE former director of An Comunn Gaidhealach yesterday claimed that he
was not given a fair hearing by the association's disciplinary committee
which dismissed him last March for gross misconduct.
Mr Donald MacLean, who is claiming unfair dismissal at an industrial
tribunal in Stornoway, also questioned the veracity of An Comunn's
record of the disciplinary meeting.
Mr MacLean was suspended on January 14, four days after Mr Donald John
MacSween had taken up the newly-created post of chief executive.
Mr MacSween told him that he was being suspended pending an internal
audit by Inverness-based chartered accountant Scott Oswald and Co, with
particular reference to the 1993 National Mod at Airdrie.
He attended a disciplinary hearing on March 17.
Asked yesterday by his solicitor, Mr Angus MacDonald, if he had
expected a fair hearing at the meeting, Mr MacLean said: ''It is a
difficult question to answer. At the back of my mind there was a feeling
it might be unfair. Mr MacSween assumed an aggressive manner.''
Questioned by Mr David Walker, An Commun's solicitor, Mr MacLean
continued: ''I wasn't given the opportunity to answer fully because Mr
MacSween was interrupting me.''
He agreed that he had been represented by an experienced trade
unionist who could have intervened to help him.
Mr Walker later read from An Commun's record of the disciplinary
meeting,the accuracy of which Mr MacLean -- who said he had not seen the
report until this week -- questioned at several points. In one, the
record held Mr MacLean to have said that he was ''sympathetic'' to the
criticism made of him by the local Mod committee at Airdrie.
Mr MacLean said: ''I would not have said that, it doesn't make any
sense. I would have been amazed by any criticism of me by Airdrie.''
Part of the reason for Mr MacLean's dismissal had been his alleged
mismanagement of the Airdrie Mod, where the finished programme had lost
#26,300. An Commun had budgeted for a loss of only #12,000.
The tribunal was told yesterday that fringe organiser Mr Billy Kelly
had budgeted for a 100% uptake of tickets. This was subsequently
detected as a mistake.
Mr Walker asked Mr MacLean why he had not acted when he realised that
this would expose An Commun. Mr MacLean said that he had no
responsibility for the fringe.
Mr Walker replied: ''I can't accept that you did not have any
responsibility.''
The tribunal adjourned yesterday but will resume for three days when
suitable dates can be agreed.

The debate about the adoption of European time confuses me. Those of
us who do business in Europe, those involved in outdoor recreation after
work, and those concerned with road safety, support the idea of adopting
a common time zone. Those who are presented in the media as being
''anti'' include farmers, those involved in construction, postal or milk
delivery, and MPs.
As these sectors are to a large extent ''independent'' of the rest of
society, let them establish their own working hours.
Does it really matter to the rest of us if farmers start their working
day at 8am instead of 7am? Might it not suit those next to a building
site if it hammered into action an hour after they left for work?
Milk delivery is not an expanding part of the economy and, if
privatisation continues apace, perhaps daily postal deliveries might
become an irregular feature of the Scottish scene. MPs are already
moving their working hours to suit themselves.
Let those who wish to start work later operate in their own time zone
and let the rest of us keep ET, not GMT.

IT'S just another Thursday on the geriatric ward. Marion is holding
the hand of a lady who will not be here when she comes on shift
tomorrow. It's two hours past the end of her shift. It doesn't matter.
People tend to take their time over dying.
''I suppose we could always hurry them along. That would certainly
raise our productivity.'' If Marion sounds cynical it is because she is,
now. It has taken three years to creep up on her. Not with her patients
though. They are all that keeps her there. For now.
No, she did not come into nursing for the money. No, she did not
always want to help people. No, she didn't dress up in a nurse's uniform
as a four-year-old and dream of wiping fevered brows.
She was good at biological sciences at school, that was all. And,
well, all right, she has always enjoyed caring for people. Much good,
she thinks, it has done her.
In the autumn, Marion will leave nursing: ''I made a mistake. I'm 29.
There's still time to get out.''
Lots of dewy-eyed sympathy from a grateful public does not help pay
the bills or find the money for a holiday in, oh, four years. Marion
shrugs. Using market rhetoric, she is, she says undervalued. She could
sell her skills elsewhere. In the US or Canada, maybe. She intends,
instead, to retrain as a computer programmer.
Within the next few weeks, the nurses' pay review body will announce
their recommendations. It will not be for the 8.34% rise the Royal
College of Nursing asked for. It is thought the pay award will be around
1%, with a further small figure predicted for performance-related pay
(PRP) settlements negotiated locally with individual hospital trusts.
Senior NHS executives in England are said to be under pressure to come
up with a productivity related scheme, although this is understood not
to be such an imperative in Scotland.
For Marion, the idea of improved productivity is a bleak joke: ''What
does it mean? How will it work? Are we to be rewarded for keeping people
alive? Does that mean those on intensive-care units and geriatric wards
like mine won't get it because our patients have a tendency to die?''
It is one more factor in the bale of straws that have broken the back
of this medical camel: ''We've been obsessed with efficiency on the
wards now for years and all I see are more stressed nurses and a
deteriorating service for patients.''
The leaders of Britain's doctors and nurses joined forces to oppose
the introduction of performance-related pay last September. The British
Medical Association and the Royal College of Nurses argued that it
risked demotivating an already demoralised staff, threatened patient
care if hospitals measured success on numbers treated, and introduced
another layer of unnecessary and expensive bureaucracy.
Last year, Health Minister Mr Gerry Malone pointed out that the pay
bill in the NHS is 70% of its total spending. He warned that a big pay
rise threatened patient services. Any increase had to be tied, as in
other public sectors, to improved efficiency and increased productivity.
The Scottish Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, June Andrews,
says the basis of the arguments for productivity-related pay are flawed:
''What is wrong with it depends on what you think pay does. It does not
reward hard work. If keeping people alive is good performance, you
better not work on wards where people are terminally ill or you won't
qualify.
''If it's to motivate, all the research from management schools and
research in industry demonstrates that it doesn't. When people do get
it, they worry about getting it next year. If they don't, they feel it
wasn't worth working hard.
''In terms of motiviation, do you think nurses are in the job just for
the money? The absolute amount of pay is not what motivates people.''
She points out that nurses do not work as individuals, but as part of
a team: ''It is the team that delivers patient care, from the ward
auxiliary sweeping behind the beds to the nurse looking after you, to
the doctor, it is a joint package of care.''
Nurses' productivity has gone up, without PRP. In June 1994, Health
Secretary Virginia Bottomley said that NHS employees' output had risen
by almost 30% between 1982 and 1991. The Health Department told the pay
review body at the end of 1993 that the NHS had achieved a 2% efficiency
gain, which had been built into spending plans.
June Andrews ask: ''Anyway, how do you measure a nurse's performance?
Do you get extra points for being fast, or nice or smiling a lot or for
being clever? It's a nonsense.''
It is already possible for NHS trusts to introduce local pay which
would include a profit-related element. It seems none of the Scottish
trusts has taken the opportunity to do so. Unless you count a #70
Christmas bonus given to all staff at the Ayrshire Hospital Trust.
In 1990, the results of a two-year-long study on the effects of the
introduction of performance-related pay for health service managers in
Scotland offered some instructive findings.
The independently funded investigation, by Peter Williamson of
Aberdeen University, reported that it not only failed to have the
intended effect of raising productivity but caused ''considerable
indignation'' among managers. It was not seen to provide any major
motiviation and had little impact on performance.
Some managers described it as a farce and others said political
profile and gameplaying were the features rewarded, not performance:
''It is hard to imagine a system so rapidly and widely discredited among
its intended beneficiaries,'' the report concluded.
It's just another Thursday on the geriatric ward and Marion hasn't
gone home yet.

Michael Tumelty's timely piece about Radio 3's focus on Scottish music
during the last week of January gives a good idea of the scale of our
coverage of contemporary Scottish composers in Composers of the Week.
But there's even more. Radio 3's morning sequence, Musical Encounters
(daily except Wednesday), also comes from Glasgow that week, and its
featured artists of the week will be the Whistlebinkies.
As well as that, there are three programmes on Scottish traditional
music, and in total our music department here in Glasgow will have been
responsible for some 26 hours of programming on the network between
January 22 and 27, including BBC SSO and SCO relays.
That is certainly an exceptional week for us, but even in a normal
week Radio 3 broadcasts on average around 10 hours from Scotland.
Throughout 1995 we shall be contributing special programmes to their
British Music Year, including substantial contributions from the BBC
SSO, and continuing to support Scottish composers through our regular
strands on both Radio 3 and Radio Scotland.

Tory rebel Nicholas Budgen names the concessions Major must make.
WHO are the nine Tory so-called rebels? Remember, on November 28 the
Government made the issue of voting extra money for the European Union a
matter of confidence. Thus, they said, if we are defeated we will ask
the Queen to call a General Election and to Tory MPs they said, if you
do not support us we will chuck you out of the party.
We, the rebels, had been given notice of this manoeuvre by the Prime
Minister in his speech on the Queen's Speech on November 16. We had the
opportunity of testing the underlying arguments. We asked aloud whether
it was necessary to make this an issue of confidence. We asked whether
the Queen would grant a dissolution. We asked whether another Tory might
not form an administration. Most of all we asked our constituency
associations whether they might be prepared to continue to support us
even if the Conservative Whip were withdrawn from us.
By November 28, eight of us decided that if we abstained we might
still survive politically. We abstained. The Whip was withdrawn and then
the ninth rebel, Sir Richard Body, resigned the Whip in protest at our
treatment.
The Government at first tried to crush us. There were frequent
assertions by the Prime Minister that we were, if not the only cause of
Government unpopularity, at least a significant cause of it. At the end
of the year the Prime Minister wrote to all Conservative constituency
chairmen in terms which might have been considered as an invitation to
de-select us as candidates for the next election.
It has since emerged that our position is more popular than we had
ever imagined. Public concern and even anger at the intrusions of
European power has become ever more obvious. There has been rising anger
over our inability to halt the export of live animals, and recently we
have seen the difficulties of the European Common Fishing Policy. All
this has been against the knowledge pointed out by the European Court of
Auditors that the activities of the European Union are riddled with
fraud and have been for a long time.
To the embarrassment of the Government, the British people seem to
prefer our attitude to Europe to that of the Government's. The Prime
Minister recognised this uncomfortable fact. The policy moved from
crushing to responding to public opinion.
On January 8 the Prime Minister gave an important interview on the
David Frost programme. This interview has not been given the attention
which it deserves. The Prime Minister said that the high tide of
European federalism was now on the decline.
He also gave a clear and important undertaking. He said that he would
not accept constitutional change that impacts upon the British
Parliament. This was a most wide-ranging and significant promise. There
can now be no further federalist moves which affect us. If the other
European countries wish to advance further towards a federal European
State, John Major promises that they must do so without Britain.
Also in that interview the Prime Minister rejected the single currency
in Europe. He said that if all the other people decided to go ahead in
1996 to 1997 with a single currency, he would not advise the British
Parliament to follow them. Even more important, the three reasons which
he gave are relevant for rejecting the single currency at all times and
not just in 1996 to 1997.
This re-emphasis of policy has been accompanied by frequent promises
that we shall be offered the Whip back sooner rather than later, that
is, in weeks not months. These tiffs get worse the longer that they
continue.
The dilemma is that the Government does not wish to admit that it was
unwise to manoeuvre us into a corner and then to kick us out of the
party. The party loyalists regret the attention given to us and there
are some who would like to see us punished further.
It seems clear that at present the public tends to support the rebels
and not the Government. This is embarrassing to the Government. But it
also makes the rebels less inclined to compromise. Some of us believe
that we have a status and importance as an independent party. I do not
think that this will be true in the long term. However, the longer the
rift continues the greater the risk that some of our members will reject
the Whip and prefer to take their chance apart from the Government.
So what can be done? The Government must offer us back the Whip as
soon as possible. Will this cause problems? Yes, but they are not
insurmountable problems. The left of the Conservative Party will grumble
that treason has been rewarded with publicity and insufficiently
punished. Will the Whip be refused? I doubt it. At least at this stage
the constituency associations of all of us will want to rejoin the
Conservative family.
Are there conditions which either side can impose? There are
circumstances which will make the ending of the rift easier but neither
side can demand conditions.
The first circumstance is that the Prime Minister should make it
absolutely plain that he stands by and will build upon his recent
statement of policy. When he demonstrates that he is immovable in this
the Cabinet, left, right and centre, will fall in behind him. The matter
will have been decided. The Frost interview certainly satisfied many of
the nine. We cannot expect to gain all our objectives. We want a
significant loosening of the relationship with Europe. In some areas we
will have to accept policies with which we do not agree. We want to know
that the balance of policy leads overall towards a loosening of the ties
of federalism.
So what can each side demand? I say that neither side can make
demands. The Government cannot demand that we never exercise the right
of Members of Parliament to disagree with their party from time to time.
It would be ridiculous to suggest that we were bound by subservience
while Messrs Fairbairn, Cash and Winterton exercised their judgment over
a wide field. We cannot be made second-class Members of Parliament.
On the other hand, we cannot demand a special place in the making of
policy. If the Prime Minister sticks to and builds upon his recent
re-statement of policy, most of us will be reassured though not
satisfied. We shall press for further loosening of the relationship with
Europe.
However with the Whip we will usually be able to support the party
even where we have doubts. We shall know that the broad thrust of policy
is Euro-sceptical. We certainly know that the Labour Party is now the
party of Euro-federalism, the Social Chapter, and the single currency.
We will never get all that we want but we would much prefer half a loaf
with the Tories than no loaf with Labour.

IT was a dramatic moment. You could have heard a sheep dropping.
International Burns Suppers Ltd held their upbeat #75-a-head Burns
supper in the Moat House Hotel last night in Glasgow. On the wall was a
vast video screen so that John Cairney, the man who made more out of
being Robert Burns than Burns himself, could be shown on a live video
link with New Zealand, where he now lives.
''Ka kite anao,'' said the video John, which is not as rude as it
sounds but is a Maori greeting. As the video ended the audience gasped,
as the real John Cairney stepped out to do the Immortal Memory after
being flown half-way around the world.
Only the mean-spirited would claim that the people gasped because the
only reason they had agreed to attend was that they thought John Cairney
was safely ensconced on the other side of the world.
Actor Elaine C Smith, associated of course with being Rab C Nesbitt's
wife, was another speaker. A keen supporter of women's rights, Elaine
has only been converted to Burns suppers in the past two years. ''I was
invited to speak at a BA dinner. Basically I thought it would be full of
middle-class drunken men falling over pished. They confirmed all my
suspicions. But they were very nice middle-class drunken men, and I've
been invited back.''
The entertainment included the Scottish samba band MacUmba. Excellent
music, but they tell me it's not always appreciated. They were the
half-time entertainment at a Rangers-Hibs match at which the Hibs fans
threw coins, half-eaten pies, and whatever was lurking at the back of
their throats at them.
Band member Rob Welsh says the problem was that they started playing
at the Rangers end first, and the Rangers fans cheered them on. So
naturally if the Rangers fans liked them then the Hibs fans decided that
they didn't. It's probably the reason why pipe bands wisely play in the
centre.
Card in a million
THERE'S many a business person who would like to get their hands on
this. Staff at Scottish Enterprise produce their own scurrilous in-house
magazine to counter the seemingly endless supply of so-called good news
stories that emanate from the organisation. Their spoof gifts page
includes a new corporate credit card with built-in smart card technology
to help people manage their business expenses effectively.
The advert says: ''The machine reads One Devonshire Gardens: Dinner
for Two. The statement reads Mario's Pizza Bar: Lunch for 14. The
machine reads Golf fees for 12: #750. The statement reads Seminar costs
for 35.'' Word is that one local enterprise chief executive did not
realise it was a send-up and wrote in for one.
Cheap night out
THE level some people will stoop to in order to attract a crowd.
Lothian's Community Education Service uses the iniquitous imposition of
VAT on fuel bills to tempt pensioners to the ''top-class variety
concerts'' organised at Edinburgh's St Brides Centre this month.
Although such top-class artists as the Tartan Lads and the
''evergreen'' Jo Gordon and Sally Logan are a draw in their own right,
the St Brides press release plaintively tells pensioners: ''At only #1,
it's cheaper than using your own heating.''
Mail in a muddle
JOURNALISM can be so difficult at times. Imagine being a reporter in
London for the Daily Mail and suddenly you are sent to Glasgow for a few
weeks to help launch a Scottish edition of the paper.
You've never been further north than the Watford Gap, and suddenly
you're in a strange city and told to attend a press conference yesterday
at the International Piping Centre. Only later does someone tell you how
embarrassing it was when in all innocence you asked: ''What do you
specialise in? Copper or lead?''

RELATIONS between local authorities and the Scottish Office plunged to
a new low yesterday after a senior civil servant made it clear in
advance of a meeting between council leaders and Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang that councillors' pleas for cash help would fall on deaf ears.
At a meeting in Edinburgh later today, representatives of the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities had hoped to persuade Mr Lang
to ease a tough, below inflation level settlement, claimed by councils
to be the worst for 20 years.
However, in what was described as ''a massive snub'' for Cosla, a
letter to Strathclyde region from Mr Harold Mills, the Permanent
Secretary of the Scottish Office Environment Department, said there was
''no scope for any adjustment in the settlement for Strathclyde or any
other authority''.
The letter sent to Strathclyde Chief Executive Neil McIntosh also
rejected a request for a special meeting between the region's leaders
and Mr Lang to discuss threatened jobs cuts and a possible 25% rise in
council tax.
Mr Mills, 56, served as a councillor in Greenock, where he was born,
before joining the Scottish Office. He achieved the post of council
treasurer.
Mr Keith Geddes, Cosla's Labour vice-president, said Mr Lang's
approach showed a complete contempt for local democracy.
He went on: ''This confirms my suspicions that the Secretary of State
is simply following Treasury instructions and is not prepared to stand
up for Scottish local government.''
Mr John Mullin, Strathclyde region's finance chairman, accused Mr Lang
of showing contempt for the people of Strathclyde and Scotland.
He said Mr Lang's ''blunt arrogance'' in letting it be known there was
no scope for change at this stage would reverberate around every
council.
He said Mr Lang's '' 'no scope' indicates there is no hope'' and urged
him to ''reflect on the implications of his actions and listen to the
pleas across Scotland from those who run local government''.
He added: ''The Government must consider some leeway in this crucial
reorganisation year or councils face chaos.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said the purpose of the the
meeting in Edinburgh with Mr Lang was to consult Cosla about the
distribution of next year's financial settlement to local authorities.
If Cosla were to argue for a different distribution to the one
proposed, the Secretary of State would consider this.
Such a comment would appear to back up the Scottish Office letter by
making it clear that only the way the settlement is distributed can be
changed -- not its overall size.
Anger is running particularly high in Strathclyde, where the options
being considered include making 5500 people redundant.
Mr Mullin said the Government could not cut the region's grant by
#115m net and say it would not have any effect on front-line services. A
cut of this magnitude would hurt services, hit jobs, and cause real pain
to the community.
He said Strathclyde leaders were furious that Mr Lang had refused to
meet them seperately over the budget. The Scottish Office has agreed to
a meeting of officials.
Meanwhile, there were signs of conflict between the regional council
and local trade union representatives yesterday over possible job cuts.
Mr Donald Shiach, secretary of the Strathclyde Joint Trade Union
Council, said his group deplored such panic measures as freezing
vacancies and terminating 500 temporary posts.
He called for a rethink and warned that, if necessary, the trade
unions would consult their members to see what steps they were prepared
to take to protect jobs and services.

YOUR Urban Voltaire has taken no part in this lottery, not from the
very beginning. Ireland has had one for many years and I have drawn
tickets in it myself and even had a minor win. I have bet on horses at
racecourses, and cards in my own house (nothing like Indian poker for
bringing you face to face with your own idiocy). I have bet on sure
things (Ptolemy was Egyptian, not Greek) and on things of which I was
unwisely sure (Percy French did not write Galway Bay). I even once bet,
pace Elvis as Sergeant McLean in GI Blues, that I could get the scanties
off a splendid wee dark-haired girl called . . . none of your business
really. I even won the bet and I will not reveal how proof was required
and indeed proved. I have sported the occasional tuxedo at a casino. I
am no stranger, in short, to wagering. See me? See Lord George Hell? But
not a note came from me or had done with this lottery. And I will tell
you why.
It takes nothing to disapprove of some chap on telly. There is a thin
bespectacled boy on television who clearly would never be permitted in
the ranks of those who committed national service. One look at the eyes
behind his gigs and you would know that here was a lack of moral fibre
incarnate.
I think the chap's name is Evans though I am not sure of that, and I
am past caring for he is undeniably a blot. I cannot take this jujube
much but then I do not have to because I have the sense not to possess a
television set or anyway not enough to pay the licence at any rate. But
I have been around enough to witness lunatics who purvey their moronic
attitudes to considerable public acclaim.
The list is nearly endless but it ends all the same; with Esther
Rantzen and Cilla Black, and eventually with the star most in need of
public hanging. With a good-going scourging beforehand. Noel Edmonds
needs to be executed, has always needed to be executed, and will
eventually meet his Essex fate by my own hands. I intend to get this
blow-up doll, Mr Blobby, a treble-size one at that, and insert it,
uninflated, up our sweatered TV personality's arsium, and blow it, and
Edmonds, up.
The entrails shall be scattered to the winds, but we shall preserve
the brain in a small Golden Shred jar, taking it out on good nights and
rejoicing in Chaldean chants. His martyrdom shall not go unnoticed.
Forty Essex schools will be named the Noel Pisspot Comprehensive School
for Illiterates and other Home Counties celebrities. Cilla Black shall
open them all and a Cabinet Minister who never went to a Yooni but sold
shares in nonexistent carpet factories will foot the bill throughout an
entire parliament.
I do not need the money and therefore I do not want it. What a wee
miserable Presbyterian I seem to be, sitting in my little South Side
club having a dram and getting young girls to massage my toes in asses'
milk while the proles are prepared to have their knackers cut off just
so that they can win all these millions. There is an ineffable sense of
superiority in not wanting to win anything at all. I am just glad I am
working.
I am horribly glad that an ex-Nazi prisoner of war won more than two
million greenbacks on the pools last weekend, but I will bet he wishes
that he had never won the pools just so that he had never gone to a Nazi
concentration camp. Andy Palionovas is aged 73 and it is splendid that
he will end his days with a spondulick or two in his back tail and I
hope sincerely that he learns not to sport white socks with dark suits
(he had his photie in the blatts revealing just this solecism). Mr
Palionovas will live in splendour and privilege for the rest of his
life. A bit like a Labour MP -- a slur and a smear that is, but not on
the former Lithuanian PoW.
It wid break yer heart to find our representatives in the House coming
upon the same outrages as the rest of us. Was there not the most
proletarian -- outside of the John Hampden of the Commons, Mr Dennis
Skinner -- member getting his top-of-the-range Jaguar stolen. Well, John
Prescott, a top-of-the-range Jag was stole from you. Good luck to you,
the Blairy-eyed boy will doubtless have an innocuous Rover but myself
I'd have a Rolls. Go ahead with the Rover.
But stay a mo. Have I not got a wee word that Labour is against
privilege? Now Labour should be dreadfully careful about orations
concerning privilege.
D'you remember how the last election the People's Party lost thousands
and thousands of votes over a publicity feature concerning the little
rich girl and the little poor girl getting disparate treatment from the
NHS? How the film turned out to be by the Chariots of Fire director and
the wee lassies were paid actresses and the info was drivel anyway? How
Denis Healey had, quite justifiably, for his wife had been in
considerable pain and the chap had the poppy after all, availed himself
of private medicine for an operation for Edna?
And now we have the privilege debate concerning education and private
schools and the like. Next week I shall address you on the subject of
why and how private schools are not better: it is just that the state
schools are worse. A lottery the latter are; place your wager. Och, I
might not write about it at all. Don't, in short, bet on it.

THE last increase in base rates in September did not trigger an
automatic increase in mortgage rates, at least not from the building
societies. The Halifax, the country's largest, has, however, now moved
its rate upwards, but only by a quarter of a percentage point. Not all
its competitors are joining in, and Abbey National in particular is
holding off still. The Abbey is no longer, strictly speaking, a building
society but mortgages remain its main business and it is the second
biggest source of these in the country. Its willingness not to move
again, yet, and the modest nature of the Halifax's increase (delayed,
and now only half the base rate rise) are a reminder of how fiercely
competitive mortgages have become. They often generate the sale of other
financial services, notably insurance, into which areas all the
societies are moving, challenging the banks and established insurance
companies. Those societies who follow the Abbey's lead and hold their
existing rates may therefore expect to attract additional business, but
they will not be able to increase the returns offered to their
depositors, and may therefore lose some of their (cheapest) cash base.
It is not just a matter of swings and roundabouts for the lenders
themselves. Some observers suspect that part at least of the present
Government's deep unpopularity in formerly safe seats in the south and
east of England is to be explained by the way in which low inflation and
its accompanying low interest rates eroded the incomes of those
dependent on returns from building society deposits, significant numbers
in the seats involved. It needs at least six depositors to fund a single
mortgage so that any gratitude borrowers may have had for the large drop
in mortgage payments these past four years has not even begun to offset
politically the resentment felt by depositors. Of course house buyers
who bought at the top of the 1980s housing boom may not have noticed the
benefits of lower mortgage rates too much since many are those who
suffer most from negative equity, where what they borrowed is now more
than their property is worth. Home-ownership, which used to work to the
Tories' benefit so much, is now working to their disadvantage (a trend
made worse with the Lamont-Clarke conversion to ending the tax advantage
attendant on buying a house).
Dearer mortgages, no matter how modestly dearer, are bound adversely
to affect the already sluggish housing market; but rising inflation will
have the opposite effect. Again swings and roundabouts can be
identified. Housing is no longer a sure way to easy money when inflation
wiped out the real money borrowed and transferred it from lenders. This
vital message remains unread by too many building society depositors,
who ought to know that their present returns are (mostly) real rather
than nominal. Borrowers have been more clued up but neither knowledge
nor ignorance may make them more responsive to the virtues of recent
monetary experience, which now looks to be moving from a benign phase so
far as mortgages are concerned.

HOW good it was to agree with the Secretary of State for Scotland when
he spoke eight months ago at the launch of the Government's White Paper
on competitiveness. Scotland's competitiveness essentially depends on
our people, he told us. Improving their skills and commitment must lie
at the heart of our strategy for competitive advantage. How ironic that
Rolls-Royce should claim that the loss of 600 specialised engineering
and technical jobs at East Kilbride is necessary because of the need to
improve performance in its engineering activities in order to enhance
its competitive position. If there is a contradiction here it is one of
which the Government is blissfully unaware. The White Paper on
competitiveness had other things to say of relevance to the East
Kilbride situation. Innovation, the successful creation of new ideas, is
essential for sustained competitiveness and wealth creation. What this
boils down to is the need for good, old-fashioned research and
development. How does Britain fare in R&amp;D? Not very well, according to
the Government, but one area singled out for praise is the UK
aeronautics industry, which is described as a leader in the design and
manufacture of advanced systems.
Stepping on the many hostages to fortune laid out before us by the
Government is a sport which palls with endless repetition. The actions
of Rolls-Royce in East Kilbride illustrate clearly the gap between
Government rhetoric and the policies pursued by some major industries.
It is too simple to say that Rolls-Royce has found itself in possession
of too many design engineers and that redundancies are essential. It is
more instructive to look at the Rolls-Royce business and try to fathom
why R&amp;D appears to play a diminishing role in its future activities. The
first conclusion to be drawn is that our major foreign competitors are
just as keen on R&amp;D as we claim to be, but in most of the countries with
which we compete there is a strong government involvement. Our
Government, famously and almost uniquely, takes the view that R&amp;D is
exclusively the role of industry. That is why the Government had no idea
that Rolls-Royce was about to make redundant hundreds of the specialists
and technicians on whom the future development of British industry
partly rests until it was told.
If Government ideology prevents aid to industries in which we excel
and in which a considerable base of technical expertise exists, is there
a case for exonerating the industries, and in this context Rolls-Royce?
It is true that developing almost anything to do with an aeroplane is an
expensive business. The capital which must be found to even begin the
process is often dauntingly large. Nevertheless, if the effort is not
made it is futile to expect much in the way of rewards. Rolls-Royce
seems to have chosen the way of collaborative development with other
companies as the way forward for future engineering products. The major
new engine on which development work is progressing is the BR 700 series
for regional jets, but the bulk of the design work for this product is
being done by BMW in Germany and the collaborative company carrying out
the work is regarded as German. What we face is a situation in which
long-range thinking, strategic planning, and the maintenance of vital
professional and skilled jobs are squandered because Rolls-Royce either
has no vision or insufficient resources. The Government has opted out;
it has created the conditions for an indigenous technological desert and
cannot complain if the result is sterility.

A JUDGE yesterday rejected a Glasgow sex attacker's offer to pay his
victim compensation of #3000 and sent him to jail for four years.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, told 23-year-old Michael Friel that he
had subjected his victim to a terrifying ordeal and imprisonment was the
only appropriate sentence.
The judge added: ''Assault with intent to rape is always a serious
offence, and I regard this as a bad example of it.''
Friel, a labourer, of Dundrennan Road, Langside, was convicted by a
jury at Glasgow Sheriff Court of assaulting his victim with intent to
rape her on Christmas Eve, 1993, and sent to the High Court in Edinburgh
for sentence.
He forced her into Wellington Lane, Glasgow, threw her over the bonnet
of the car, seized her by the throat, ripped her clothes and puched her,
all with intent to rape.
Yesterday, Mr Scott Brady, Advocate-depute, told Lord Ross that Friel
had met his victim in Bonkers Public House in Hope Street, Glasgow on
the night of the offence.
The 21-year-old woman and some colleagues were out having a drink
after work. Friel's attentions were not repelled, although not
particularly welcome, and later the young woman did leave the public
house with him, but she was forced into the lane and attacked.
Friel told his victim: ''Stop screaming or I will kill you.'' Her last
recollection was seeing his fist come down towards her before she lost
consciousness.
She came to, half-naked, and started screaming for help. Eventually,
two men found her in a distressed state.
Miss Isobel Wylie, defence counsel, told the court that Friel was
willing to pay #3000 compensation to his victim.
She pointed out that Friel had already spent five weeks in custody,
and this had proved a salutary experience.

THE bottle had guarded its messages for all of 123 years until a
stonemason uncovered its secrets yesterday. Mr Calum Cruickshank, 24, of
Milngavie, found the time capsule while working on the McPhater Street
Church in Glasgow which is being redeveloped as an international centre
of piping.
The glass jar was in a hollow sandstone block in a pillar on the first
floor of the church. The lid had been cemented on and the area around it
filled with sand. The jar had lain there since May 15, 1872, and
contained information about the church, its origins, and a number of old
newspapers, including The Glasgow Herald from May 15 of that year, price
1d.
For this princely sum, you could read about infanticide in Crosshill,
the largest hot-blast furnace in Scotland making its first casting, a
''rascally doctor'' charged with murdering his wife in London, and how
the Caledonian Railway could run a train between Glasgow and Edinburgh
in the remarkable time of 70 minutes.
The church documents and invoices to the building of the Cowcaddens
Free Church -- the original name of the building -- include background
on the creation of the Free Church, which was built to cater for the
population of Cowcaddens, at that time upwards of 15,000.

A LEADING oil company was fined at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday
after they admitted contravening health and safety regulations following
a fire on the Piper Bravo installation.
Elf Enterprise Caledonia Ltd, Victoria, London, admitted failing to
ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the safety of employee Mr
Graeme Black, of Meadowhead Farm, Addiewell, West Lothian, and AMOD
employee Mr Terrance Murphy, from Stockton, on the Piper Bravo platform
in the North Sea.
The court heard that on March 18 last year, as Mr Murphy and Mr Black
were draining a seal pot, hydrocarbon in a bucket carried by production
operator Mr Murphy caught fire. The fire spread to the hydrocarbon
draining from the seal pot and both men's clothing. Neither man was
injured and the fire was quickly extinguished.
The company admitted failing to ensure the safe extraction of
hydrocarbon fluid from the seal pots. Leakage of hydrocarbon into the
seal pots was removed by draining excess hydrocarbon fluids without a
safe system of bonding the buckets to earth.
Depute Fiscal Mr Ray Craig told the court the platform had encountered
technical problems prior to the incident and various modifications had
been made. On the day in question, the two men were investigating the
source of a liquid assumed to be leaking from a seal on a process pump.
They had removed a bucket of fluid when it ignited, splashing over them.
Defence agent Mr James Tierney said those responsible for the incident
were the individuals involved, who were aware of the requirement for
using an earthing strap. However, he said the company had to accept its
responsibility in the matter by not stopping unsafe practices which were
developing.
Noting that the maximum fine he could impose was #40,000, Sheriff
Alexander Jessop fined the company #5000.

FOUR patients died after a ''house-full notice'' was posted at a
hospital's intensive care unit, an advocate told a fatal accident
inquiry yesterday.
Three died in other hospitals and one died on the operating table of
Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Happily, one of the six patients who were
refused entry -- a pregnant woman from Greenock -- later gave birth to a
baby in the city's Southern General hospital.
The inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court into the death of retired miner
Mr James McGowan, 67, heard that two extra beds in the Royal's unit
could not be opened because two nurses were off sick. There was a
four-hour delay because there was no intensive care bed for Mr McGowan
in the Royal.
Mr Gerald Carrol, advocate for the McGowan family, said: ''Of the six
people refused a bed, including Mr McGown, four died. The house-full
notice went up at least 12 hours before Mr McGowan died.''
He was questioning Mr David Hume, 35, the hospital's director of
contracts and patient services. Mr Hume said the five permanent
intensive-care beds were full and two others could not be opened because
of staff sickness.
Efforts to find back-up nurses had failed on the day that Mr McGowan,
of Prosen Street, Tollcross, died. Depute fiscal Mrs Margaret Porter
told Mr Hume: ''There was no slack built into the system to comfortably
run the unit in emergencies.''
A surgeon at the Royal spent one hour trying to find an intensive care
bed in another hospital for Mr McGowan. One became available after a
woman died in the Southern General hospital's unit but, by then, it was
too late to save him.
Mr John Pollock, the head of vascular surgery at the Royal, told the
inquiry he was ''incensed'' by the lack of beds.
However, Professor Charles Ruckley, of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, said
the operation should have gone ahead sooner. Mr McGowan died when a
leaking aneurysm -- a blockage -- in an artery in his abdomen burst.
Mr Hume said 353 patients a year had been transferred across the city
from hospitals to other intensive care beds in hospitals by special
''shock team ambulances''. On the night Mr McGowan died, no bed was
available anywhere.
The hearing was adjourned until next week to enable the doctor in
charge of the unit when Mr McGowan died on January 29, l994, to give
evidence.

NORTH Sea helicopter pilots face some of the world's worst flying
conditions -- and justifiably regard themselves as among aviation's
elite.
They dose themselves daily on a diet of storm-force winds, torrential
rain, thick fog, and rolling, mountainous seas while ferrying about on
vital oil business.
''You could say that we have to put up with some bloody awful
weather,'' said a North Sea helicopter pilot with 20 years' experience.
''I was on a flight when we got struck by lightning but, fortunately,
we had no problems. The North Sea area can sometimes be a dreadful place
to fly in. Now, if we were flying in the Mediterranean -- that would be
fine.''
Pilots generally believe that the various authorities and
organisations are at least doing all they can to make flying in this
storm-lashed part of the world as safe as is humanly possible.
Helicopter liferafts have been improved, as have immersion suits for
crew and passengers and radar services. To help the emergency services,
rescue centres now have RAF Sea King helicopters on hand.
A recent innovation on helicopters is the fitting of health and usage
monitoring systems (known as HUMS). These involve attaching sensors to
important parts of the helicopter, which can be monitored by engineers
on the ground to give an early warning of problems.
''Helicopters have become more sophisticated and there are a series of
on-going improvements being introduced by the Civil Aviation Authority
in conjunction with the helicopter operators and the oil companies,''
said the pilot.

A JUNIOR doctor told an industrial tribunal yesterday she had to work
an 84-hour week when on nightshift at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in
Paisley.
Dr Valerie Dudgeon, 24, formerly a junior house officer at the
hospital, said she had to work 12-hour shifts from midnight for seven
days once every six weeks.
She and three colleagues have taken the Royal Alexandra Hospital Trust
to a Glasgow industrial tribunal because they claim they were overworked
and underpaid while working overtime.
Dr Dudgeon told the tribunal she worked more than 60 hours in a normal
week and only twice in six months had time to go to the canteen for a
30-minute lunchbreak.
On the night shift, the most sleep she managed was two periods of 20
minutes. She said she was always extremely busy in her first hospital
job after graduating from medical school but her overtime was paid at
the rate of only 70% of her normal hourly rate.
She told the tribunal her duties meant she was often responsible for
168 beds in six medical wards and the coronary care unit, in addition to
casualty and acute medical admissions.
When on dayshift, her finishing time in theory was 4.30 but she
usually finished about 6.30 or seven.
She and colleagues expressed concern to the consultants that the
demands were unrealistic.
Sh said: ''Our main complaint was the intensity of the work that we
did, the breakneck work that we did. Even within our normal hours it
would still be very hard.''
She told the tribunal she was paid 24 hours a week overtime at 70% of
her hourly rate but worked far more than that in practice.
The tribunal heard conditions had since changed for the better at the
Royal Alexandra Hospital. Dr Dudgeon now works in paediatrics at
Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow.
The case will continue for five days on June 19.

KABUL: A British mercenary soldier held prisoner in Afghanistan for
eight months as an alleged spy is to be freed by his Shi'ite Muslim
captors tomorrow, according to a British diplomat.
Envoy Stephen Evans, who is based in Pakistan, met the leader of the
group holding 28-year-old Eden Paul Rollie Fernandez this week and he
promised to free him on Saturday morning.
The Muslim Hezbi-Wahadat group had earlier claimed that their
prisoner, who fought for a faction supporting Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, was a British spy.

CONCERN was growing last night about the safety of four Britons,
including a Scot, held hostage in Sierra Leone. The Foreign Office said
the situation in the country was bad and there was real cause for
anxiety.
Two Britons were among five European workers seized yesterday when
rebels raided Sieromco, a Swiss mining company, at Monkaji, 80 miles
from the capital, Freetown.
One of the Britons was said to be the general manager, James Eastwood.
This means four Britons are held by rebels, although not necessarily
by the same rebel group. Two British Voluntary Service Overseas workers,
25-year-old Calum Murray from Lewis, and 30-year-old Londoner Robert
D'Cruz, were taken hostage in November by the Revolutionary United
Front, who claimed they were military spies.
The Foreign Office has established radio contact with the group
through the British High Commission in Freetown. Sources said they
believed the rebels had been persuaded the two men really were VSO
workers.
It was understood that they were being well-treated and their release
was only a matter of time. However developments in the last 48 hours had
altered things and the situation was now ''a real worry''.
The other four Europeans seized are believed to be two Swiss and a
German. Military sources had earlier spoken of up to 15 foreigners
captured in the attack and they said 20 local staff were also taken
hostage.
A spokesman for Sieromco's parent company, Alu-Suisse, told BBC radio
that Government helicopters had begun evacuating staff from Mokanji to
Freetown.

BY THE hundred thousand they gathered under a summer sun in Sydney,
and by the dozen they braved ice and snow in Roy Bridge to celebrate the
beatification of the woman set to become Australia's first saint.
Mother Mary MacKillop, a nun who died in 1909, was beatified by the
Pope yesterday in a ceremony incorporating a traditional aboriginal
smoking ritual at a race track in Sydney, accompanied by the equally
ancient drones of the bagpipe and didgeridoo.
Among the congregation of 200,000 in Sydney was Father Edward Murphy,
the parish priest of St Margaret's, Roy Bridge, Invernesshire. His
parishioners, who number 300 in total, were also celebrating at a
special mass followed by a village ceilidh.
Mary MacKillop was born in Australia in 1842, but her life was a
testament to the twin Scottish passions of education and egalitarianism.
Her fiery determination to provide education and social welfare for all,
rather than live a contemplative life in a nunnery, were opposed by
powerful business interests and the church hierarchy of the church in
Australia. She was excommunicated before her remarkable qualities were
recognised.
Those qualities of great intelligence and compassion were inherited
from her father, Alexander MacKillop, of Roy Bridge, according to Mrs
Ann MacDonell, who has been tracing the genealogy of Lochaber families
for 20 years and has collaborated on a book published in Australia about
Mary's father.
Alexander MacKillop was one of the many Scots for whom emigration was
not a happy experience. The son of a shepherd, he was the traditional
lad o'pairts, and as a great scholar was destined for the priesthood.
He was sent to study in Rome, but became ill and abandoned the
priesthood. When he returned to Roy Bridge he found his parents
preparing to emigrate to Australia and offered to go first to prepare
the way for them. There he met Flora MacDonald, who had emigrated with
her family from the Fort William area. They married and had eight
children.
Mary was the eldest, and received the benefit of her father's
education from an early age. Alexander, unsuited to the cut-throat
business life of a pioneering country, was reviled as a failure who
could not provide for his family. Perhaps that experience, combined with
the education she received from her father and the realisation that
other poor children had no access to education, shaped her vision.
Mrs MacDonell says: ''She wanted to found an order of nuns who would
go out and found small school to bring both religion and learning to the
poor, but the bishops insisted that nuns had to be behind closed
walls.''
Undaunted, she went to Rome to seek permission from the Pope -- and
duly received it. She returned to Australia to found the Josephites, and
at a recent count the Sisters of St Joseph numbered more than 2000,
responsible for many primary and secondary schools, hospitals,
orphanages, mother and baby homes, homes for the elderly, and mobile
missions -- and a missionary order in Peru.
Mary's stubborn refusal to be thwarted by power or influence has
endeared her memory to those campaigning for the ordination of women,
although the Pope used a meeting with nuns before the beatification to
restate the church's stance on the role of women. He said that a
mistaken anthropology was at the root of society's failure to understand
the church's teaching.
Mother Mary -- so-called because of the devotion she inspired among
the children in the orphanages -- is now the Blessed Mary MacKillop.
Before she can become a saint, a miracle has to be attributed to her
powers.

Washington, Thursday,
THINGS are going badly for O J Simpson, even before the opening
statements in his trial. The judge has ruled that the evidence of
alleged wife-beating, harassing, and stalking may be used against him.
Judge Ito announced yesterday in Los Angeles that many of the long
list of alleged incidents of domestic abuse produced by the prosecution
were ''relevant to motive, intent, premeditation, and identity''.
The prosecution will be able to use 29 of the 60 or so alleged
incidents it described in a court hearing last week.
The judge disallowed incidents apparently reported in a diary that
Nicole Simpson kept, which included reports that Mr Simpson had
threatened to kill her.
He said that while the diary might appear highly relevant to the man
or woman in the street, it was hearsay under the rules of evidence and
therefore could not be allowed.
He also said that the prosecutors could not use evidence of a shelter
for battered women which Nicole was said to have called five days before
she was murdered.
The judge worked his way through the list of incidents, approving most
of them and rejecting some as hearsay.
The prosecution had already suspended its claim to use 19 incidents,
saying it was searching for further corroboration, and may try to have
them approved for submission to the jury later.
The judge did, however, permit use of evidence that Mr Simpson
allegedly smashed Nicole's car's windshield with a baseball bat,
evidence of an alleged fight in 1989 in which she called the police, and
a second incident when he allegedly broke down the door of her house and
she called the police.
The call was recorded and has been broadcast repeatedly. In the
recording Mrs Simpson sounds terrified and Mr Simpson can be heard
shouting in the background.
A dispute between two of the lawyers defending Mr Simpson, Robert
Shapiro and F Lee Bailey, seems to have been resolved.
A week ago, each was denouncing the other in extreme terms and vowing
never more to speak to the other. Now they are friends again.
The judge is re-examining the 12 jurors and 12 alternates and has so
far rejected two
The jurors have been sequestered in a motel for 10 days now: the judge
ruled they could have visits from their spouses.
He also decreed that opening statements, which were to be made today
or tomorrow, will now be heard on Monday, unless there is yet another
delay to the proceedings.

Moscow, Thursday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin declared today that the military stage in the
campaign in rebel Chechnya was ''effectively over'' after Russia said
its troops had taken the presidential palace, symbol of Chechen
resistance.
A Government spokesman said troops moved into the battered building in
the centre of the capital Grozny and hoisted the Russian tricolour after
the last Chechen irregulars pulled out.
''The building has been captured, fully captured,'' said the
spokesman.
However Chechen fighters said they left the palace after a vicious
three-week Russian bombardment to avoid heavy casualties and that their
stand against Kremlin rule was far from over.
Rebel commander Akhmed Baibatyrov said: ''This does not mean we have
been defeated.''
He said there was nothing left of the scorched and crumbling palace
but the walls and it ''could not serve as a shelter any more''.
However in a low-key statement devoid of any triumphalism, Yeltsin
insisted: ''The military stage of the restoration of the Russian
constitution in the Chechen republic is effectively over.
In recognition of the enormous cost of the victory, he added: ''I bow
my head to the memory of the soldiers killed in this conflict, to those
victims among the civilian population.''
The fall of the palace to the better-equipped Russian troops appeared
to doom Chechen hopes of keeping control of the city itself.
Western military experts said they saw its fall as the end of first
phase of the Chechnya conflict, signalling the start of a Chechen
guerrilla war.
''It is clearly not the end of Chechen resistance. You can expect them
to carry on in the hills in guerrilla-type fighting,'' said one military
specialist.
Yeltsin sent troops and tanks pouring into the region on December 11
in a high-risk operation to crush the three-year drive for independence
of Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, a 50-year-old former Soviet air
force general.
His whereabouts were not known today, but it seems likely he will now
become a guerrilla leader in the mountains.
The brutality of the Russian campaign, including air strikes on Grozny
with many civilian deaths, has compromised Yeltsin's reputation as a
democrat in the eyes of the West and lost him the support of his former
liberal backers at home.
Hundreds, possibly thousands, have died in mainly-Muslim Chechnya in
Moscow's biggest military action since the Soviet Union sent troops into
Afghanistan in 1979 at the start of a 10-year debacle.
The failure of the Russian army to break the Chechen resistance more
quickly and mounting Russian casualties -- put at 1160 dead earlier this
week -- has also led to disquiet among the military top brass.
Today Yeltsin stripped three generals who have been highly critical of
the Chechnya campaign from the rank of Deputy Defence Minister.
Interfax said the three included General Boris Gromov, who commanded
the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan which was completed in 1989.

THE Super Puma is one of the safest helicopters in the world. Twin
engines give it added insurance of survivability over land or sea in the
event of mechanical failure.
However, the crew of the aircraft downed over the North Sea yesterday
by lightning was lucky that the gale-force winds and mountainous waves
of recent days had subsided by the time it ditched 140 miles north-east
of Aberdeen.
Its 18 civilian passengers had time to scramble into liferafts in
moderate seas as a rescue operation was launched.
The basic Franco-German aircraft was designed as a military transport
capable of carrying 18 to 20 combat-equipped troops into battle. It saw
active service with the South African forces against Cuban and native
insurgents in Angola and inside South Africa itself during the 1980s.
As an industrial workhorse for the North Sea, the 8.5-tonne helicopter
normally carries a two-man crew and up to 20 passengers. About 40 Super
Pumas are currently in service with UK firms.
However, the twin turbines mounted above its fuselage, while improving
its airworthiness, are a positive disadvantage if it has to ditch at
sea. Like the more common Sea King in British use, it is top heavy.
The Super Puma is equipped with small floats and backup flotation bags
to allow it to land on water and stay afloat in calm conditions. In
stormy seas, these are purely a temporary survival measure to allow
passengers and crew to bale out in the seconds before the aircraft turns
turtle and goes under.
The helicopter itself will quickly overturn and sink like a stone if
its buoyancy is breached. For anyone trapped inside the fuselage, it is
a potential deathtrap.
North Sea workers, like all service personnel who use helicopters
regularly, are supposed to train on a ''dunker'' to improve their
chances of surviving a crash at sea.
They must undergo a basic survival course which involves being
strapped into a dummy fuselage which is then dropped into a swimming
pool. Like its real-life brother, the fuselage upturns and sinks in
seconds.
The trick for the individuals concerned is to unstrap from a seat
which is now upside down and underwater, recover from the impact with
the water, and make their way to a door before the sinking helicopter
becomes a tomb.
In training, the process is traumatic. In real life, in freezing
waters, with a crash at up to 100mph, survival of even the fittest is in
question. Shock and panic take over.
In advance of the Falklands' landings in 1982, 19 members of the SAS
died when their Sea King helicopter plummeted into the South Atlantic
after a bird strike. They were men to whom helicopter operations were
second nature.
It remains the biggest single loss of life for the UK's elite
counter-insurgency force in a single incident, and demonstrates the
problem of surviving a helicopter crash in cold waters.
Helicopter pilots usually have only two main fears. The first is
catastrophic failure of the gearbox system which controls the main rotor
blades. Secondly, the failure or loss of the tail rotor.
In either case, their cheerful pre-flight advice is that one should
stick one's head between one's legs and kiss one's ass goodbye.
The following are among the tragedies affecting North Sea helicopter
operations in recent years:
* August 1981: 13 people killed when Wessex helicopter crashed off the
Norfolk coast.
* November 1986: Britain's worst helicopter disaster when 45 men died
after a Boeing Vertol 234 Chinook crashed into the sea near Shetland.
* March 1991: Six men killed when aSikorsky S61N struck a crane on a
Shell oil platform and plunged into the sea 116 miles east of Lerwick in
Shetland.
* August 1991: A Bell 212 crashed with the loss of three men while on
maintenance work in the Ekofisk field.
* March 1992: Eleven people killed when French-built Bristow Super
Puma helicopter plunged into the North Sea.

Kobe, Thursday
THE death toll from this week's massive earthquake in western Japan
passed 4000 today, making it the deadliest since an earthquake and fire
levelled most of Tokyo in 1923.
Police said the number of dead as of late today stood at 4015, with
587 people still missing nearly three days after the 7.2 tremor. More
than 21,600 people were injured.
In the ravaged port city of Kobe, exhausted rescuers worked around the
clock, using picks, shovels, crowbars, and bare hands to move tons of
debris in search of survivors.
Fires continued to burn and as many as 50 new blazes broke out in
damaged buildings.
In this century only the 1923 quake in Tokyo and the surrounding Kanto
plain was worse, killing 100,000 people.
Emperor Akihito today expressed his condolences ''from the bottom of
my heart''.
''I truly hope everyone can overcome this unfortunate period through
strong solidarity and co-operation, and that our wisdom will be brought
to bear to make our country stronger and safer against disasters,'' he
said.
Visiting Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said the devastation ''was
much worse than I had expected''. He said the top priority would be to
save people who may still be alive after more than two days in the
ruins.
Astonishing survivors were today still being found under the rubble of
the more than 29,000 buildings that were destroyed or heavily damaged.
Two 80-year-old women were pulled alive from rubble in Nishinomiya to
the east of Kobe. One of them, Setsuko Orii, was barely scratched and
even her glasses were intact. Rescuers tried to carry her away but she
told them: ''I can walk myself.''
Another 60-year-old woman was pulled virtually unscathed from the
wreckage of a four-storey block of flats.
Japan's Kyodo News Service said two men aged 74 and 94 were found
alive beneath the wreckage of collapsed houses in the city of Ashiya.
A nine-year-old boy was rescued this afternoon, still conscious 57
hours after the quake.
With constant fears of aftershocks, some shopkeepers today piled their
goods out on the streets and were selling them for a pittance. Some
greengrocers were simply giving food away.
As survivors struggled to fend for themselves, many accused the
Government of dragging its feet in providing aid.
In once prosperous Kobe some 275,000 are now living in temporary
shelters in gymnasiums and schools where they are still suffering in
bitter winter temperatures from a chronic shortage of food, water,
heating, and clean toilets.
Most of Kobe is still without power, water, or gas, meaning most
residents cannot cook.
Elderly survivor Shigemitsu Okino said: ''I was a child when the city
was destroyed during the war. It looked a lot like this. The difference
is we could hear the planes coming, but the earthquake was silent.''
The Tokyo Fire Defence Agency today predicted an earthquake of this
same size would kill or injure some 67,700 people if it hit the capital.

STUDENTS from Stirling University who were caught by the Kobe
earthquake plan to walk out of the disaster zone tomorrow, if official
rescue attempts fail.
Post-graduate student Irene McVey, 29, of Liberton, Edinburgh, said
the nine students and their lecturer, who were on a study tour, had been
unable to leave the Kobe Institute, in the hills of the stricken town.
''We're just desperate to get out,'' she said. ''It now looks as if
we're going to have to make our own way out of Kobe, and we may even
have to walk.''
She added that if official transport did not arrive tomorrow, she and
several others planned to walk 13 miles to the relative safety of Osaka.
A university spokesman said it was hoped to evacuate the group by car
to Kobe port, from where they would be taken by hydrofoil to Osaka
airport on Saturday.

JAMMU: More than 200 people were believed dead and 400 others buried
under snow after avalanches roared down Himalayan mountainsides along
the Srinagar-Jammu Highway.
The United News of India (UNI) said that the final toll could be much
higher as rescue teams had not yet reached some affected areas.
Police said as many as five buses had plunged off the 110-mile highway
that winds through the foothills of the Himalayas since heavy snowfalls
hit the area three days ago.
Some 5000 people had been rescued from vehicles stranded along the
highway.
UNI said 133 bodies had been recovered from the area since the
avalanches began, and many more were thought to be buried in the snow.
It said 400 people were still taking refuge in the 1.7-mile Jawahar
road tunnel. The Press Trust of India reported that Air Force
helicopters had dropped food and blankets around the mouth of the tunnel
for the stranded travellers.
The news agency said fresh snowfalls had hampered repair work at some
points along the highway, which snakes through precipitous passes,
providing the isolated Kashmir Valley with its only road link to the
rest of India.--Reuter.

BEFORE emerging at lunchtime yesterday, the white-collar workers sat
in The Hilton, as the East Kilbride complex is dubbed, poring over The
Herald report of their demise.
Even by then, the news had not fully sunk in, according to technical
author Alan Patterson, 31, from Ibrox, Glasgow.
He doubted whether the demoralised workforce, among the highest paid
in Scotland, will fight redundancy because it ''would make no
difference. Derby has always been the headquarters. We feel let down, We
thought we had security here but no more''.
Mr Kenny Marshall, 31, from Balloch, an assistant chief technical
author who for 10 years has travelled the 30 miles to East Kilbride,
said: ''There's loyalty for you.''
He predicted few asked to transfer to Derby will go -- reluctant to
pass on their knowledge and skills to a plant that will survive because
of East Kilbride's closure.
Unions are gearing up for a fight and described the management
announcement as ''a mistake . . . a decision that could put the future
of the whole company at risk''.
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions, mainly
representing Manufacturing, Science, and Finance and other technical
white-collar workers, stressed that the firm must not be allowed to get
away with the transfer of work but that it was too early to say if
industrial action would follow.
He said no extra jobs were being created under the transfer of work in
which East Kilbride was being sacrificed.
Along with Mr Graham Irvine, senior shop steward for manual workers in
the AEU, T&amp;GWU, and GMB, he pledged to win support from MPs, local
councils, and other agencies to put pressure on the company.
Labour voiced alarm at the ''devastating'' blow. Scottish employment
spokesman John McFall said: ''The most worrying thing is these are
exactly the kind of flagship high-quality high-tech jobs which Labour
has been warning that Scotland desperately needs to retain and develop
if we are to be industry leaders.
''The number of job losses is a blow to Scotland's manufacturing
hopes. I will be working closely with local MP Adam Ingram to see what
can be done, if anything, to rescue these jobs.''
Scottish nationalists reacted with equal alarm, saying it was a
further erosion of a vital Scottish skills base.
Scottish Liberal Democrats' leader Jim Wallace said: ''These are jobs
which Scotland can ill-afford to lose. In the ever more competitive
world economy, Scotland's fate depends on attracting highly skilled jobs
-- not losing them.''
East Kilbride District Council's depute leader Harry Winslow said he
was shocked: ''It's an enormous blow to the town, which is synonymous
with science and technology. It leaves a huge hole in the local
economy.''

ROLLS-ROYCE opened its East Kilbride plant officially on Friday,
November 20, 1953, emphasising the growing importance of the new town as
a centre of industrial engineering.
At the time, officials said the future of the town's residents was an
industrial one and their success depended on the success of industries
attracted to the area. The opening ceremony was conducted by the
Minister of Supply, Mr Duncan Sandys.
The 60,000sq ft factory was the biggest single industrial unit in East
Kilbride at the time and was built in 15 months. It opened with 2600
employees and there were plans to employ a workforce of 3500 by the
following year.
The team's initial brief was to concentrate on the manufacture of Avon
jet engines for a variety of aircraft, both military and civil. Avon
engines were used in a variety of Royal Air Force planes, including the
Hunter and Swift fighters and the Canberra and Valiant bombers. The
plant was also designed to do repair and maintenance work on existing
engines.
The workers recruited in the first year were mainly Scots but some key
individuals were brought in from the firm's plants in Derby, London,
Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool.
In a special supplement to commemorate the plant's official opening,
The Herald said its value extended far beyond the important jobs it
brought to the area.
The then chairman of Rolls-Royce, Lord Hives, said the firm's role was
to meet the Government's demand to produce the right article at the
right price and at the right time. He said they must always be looking
for new products and new markets for exports.
''Rolls-Royce,'' he concluded, ''will support any effort to make sure
that the East Kilbride factory establishes a reputation for efficient
and economical operation. That is the task we have set ourselves.''

DEVASTATING news. Colossal loss. Absolute tragedy. The reactions which
greeted Rolls-Royce's stark decision to axe its aero-engine design
division at East Kilbride could scarcely have been more apocalyptic.
With good reason. The next few months will see the dismantling of what
is almost certainly the most significant concentration of industrial
research, development and design anywhere in Scotland.
There are a few other outstanding examples of collective technical and
engineering brain power -- for example, the automated banking terminal
plant in Dundee owned by AT&amp;T Global Systems, formerly known as NCR. But
Rolls-Royce at East Kilbride stood out.
Of the 600 affected staff, 500 are highly skilled engineers,
designers, and technicians. Their task has been to create products, not
just to assemble or overhaul products created by others elsewhere. This
is as far away from the screwdriver economy as you can get.
So the sense of loss is all the more acute. Last year, the CBI
Scotland report, Manufacturing Matters, said: ''More must be done to
harness Scotland's intellectual property to add value to our goods and
services.'' This week's news at Rolls-Royce is a massive setback to that
ambition.
Seen from Rolls-Royce's corporate headquarters in London and from the
headquarters of its Aerospace Group in Derby, the rationale of what is
happening to another satellite plant in Scotland might seem impeccable.
The Tay engine, developed in East Kilbride, is well into its
production phase. The newer Trent engine, developed at Derby, is also on
sale in the market-place. The latest BR700 series is being developed in
Germany, in a joint venture between BMW and Rolls-Royce.
Rolls-Royce argues that it can handle any further research and
development on existing engine series or any future product lines
comfortably within the capabilities it has at Derby and Bristol. Given
the massive front end cost to the company of developing the Trent, the
likelihood is that any future engine designs will, in fact, emerge from
global joint ventures.
Rolls-Royce may even be thinking that the future lies not in
aero-engine development, but in targeting demand for new generations of
industrial turbines. Faced with these scenarios, East Kilbride may have
looked -- from London and Derby -- even more peripherally dispensable.
But, for the Scottish economy, such thinking poses deeply disturbing
challenges.
As the Rolls-Royce executives were convening at a Glasgow Airport
hotel, on the eve of their shock announcement, the chief executive of
the Weir Group, Sir Ron Garrick, was delivering the 1995 Prestige
Lecture to the Institution of Electrical Engineers at Strathclyde
University.
He was telling his audience: ''The control of technology at a centre
with an ability to transmit it to any part of the world to suit local
manufacturing conditions will be a major requirement of our business.''
He was talking days after Weir Group announced a rationalisation of
its pumps business, with most of the pain being inflicted in Manchester
and California. A useful reminder that defining the periphery depends on
where the headquarters are located.
In Rolls-Royce's case, with southern headquarters, the pain, acute
pain, is being felt in Lanarkshire. And, for Scotland, the loss of
control of a slice of aerospace technology raises deep questions about
how and whether we can move away from being a screwdriver economy
fragilely dependent on the intellectual flair of others.

PRESSURE was increasing on the Government last night to ban live
animal exports as protesters again clashed with riot police. Dozens of
demonstrators were slightly hurt and 21 arrests made at the Essex port
of Brightlingsea.
The local Conservative MP, Mr Bernard Jenkin, member for Colchester
North, said it was time for Parliament to act. His call came after
Labour urged Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave to impose an
immediate, unilateral ban on shipments of calves to Continental veal
crates.
Businessmen, children, and pensioners again linked arms in
Brightlingsea in an effort to stop sheep being shipped to Belgium. Ms
Sue Wheeler, head of the local protest group, was among those arrested.
Residents have accused officers of unnecessary brutality and police
admit it could take years to rebuild relations with the community.
Protesters yesterday failed to stop lorries getting through but gales
prevented the ship, Caroline, from leaving.
Local residents joined Mr Jenkin in Westminster to give the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food a petititon with more than 2000
signatures calling for an end to live exports for slaughter.
The Government says it is doing all it can to improve animal welfare
throughout the European Union but cannot act independently for fear of
breaching EU free trade rules.
Earlier, Labour launched a new policy document on animal welfare and
called for the Government to ban British calves from being exported into
Continental veal crates.
Vets are urging protesters to stop making life worse for livestock in
transport by being rowdy and lying in front of lorries. Animals were
suffering stress-related diseases as a result, said the British
Veterinary Association.

AN athletics coach who pled guilty to four charges of breach of the
peace, after sending grossly obscene questionnaires to young girls, is
to be prevented from coaching in future.
The name of David Low, who on Monday was sentenced to 18 months'
probation at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, was to be deleted from the Scottish
Athletic Federation's list of coaches, Mr Bob Greenoak, the federation's
secretary confirmed yesterday.
He said: ''We will refuse to allow him to compete in all championships
under our jurisdiction, and are taking legal advice about our right to
exclude him from the sport altogether. We do not wish this man to be a
member of any club.''
The charges, which related to girls aged from 12 to 14, were
instrumental in provoking the resignation of two committee members of
Aberdeen Amateur Athletic Club.
Low, 27, a maths graduate who has recently completed a Ph D in
statistics, used copied Aberdeen University headed paper, allegedly for
research purposes, and the name of a former student. Although the girls
believed they would remain anonymous, Low had a scheme for identifying
those who replied with details of their sexual habits.
Another club, Babcock Thorn Pitreavie, to which Low also belonged, has
withdraw his membership.
Low entered a hurdles event at the East District indoor championships
at the Kelvin Hall on Sunday, the day before he was sentenced, but he
did not attend.
However, there now appears to be nothing to prevent him attending open
graded meetings. The sport could be forced to take out an interdict to
stop his attendance at such events.

PARATROOPER Lee Clegg could face life in prison after Law Lords
yesterday dismissed his appeal against conviction for the murder of the
teenage passenger of a Belfast joyrider.
The unanimous 15-page judgment by the five Law Lords dented the hopes
of The Parachute Regiment, which has been campaigning to have his
conviction reduced to manslaughter.
However, senior officers pledged that the ''fight for justice'' would
continue until Clegg, 26, from Leeds, was released.
A regimental spokesman said: ''The regiment will give every support it
can through the necessary channels to obtain the release of one of our
colleagues convicted of an offence while doing his duty.''
The Law Lords judgment said there was no rule that a defendant, who
had used a greater degree of force than was necessary, should be found
guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.
It added that a soldier in Northern Ireland had ''no scope for
graduated force'' -- the only choice was between firing a rifle or doing
nothing.
Clegg, who is being held in Wakefield prison, was part of a 15-man
patrol ordered to set up a road block in Belfast in September, 1990.
When a stolen car driven by 17-year-old Martin Peake broke through
their cordon, the Paras fired more than 30 rounds, 19 of them hitting
the car.
The driver was killed instantly and one of the passengers, Karen
Reilly, 18, died on her way to hospital.
It was not until almost a year later that charges were brought against
some of the patrol members after a BBC Panorama TV programme suggested a
Government ''shoot-to-kill'' policy.
Five Paras were charged with attempted murder and malicious wounding
as well as perverting the course of justice and obstructing the RUC.
However, when the case came to trial in August, 1993, Clegg was
sentenced to life for the murder of Karen Reilly, Private Barry Aindow
was convicted of attempted murder, and the others were acquitted.
Clegg fired four shots -- the first three were considered legal as
they were fired in self-defence or in defence of Private Aindow.
However, the fourth was fired into the side of the car after it had
gone 50ft past the road block.
At the Northern Ireland Appeal Court in March last year, the appeal
was dismissed because the judge said Clegg could not have fired the
fourth shot in defence of himself or Pte Aindow as they were no longer
in danger.
In the judgment yesterday, Lord Lloyd of Berwick said: ''The defence
either succeeds or it fails. If it succeeds, the defendant is acquitted.
If it fails, he is guilty of murder.''
The judge added: ''I regret that under existing law, on the facts
found by the trial judge, he had no alternative but to convict of
murder.''
The four other Law Lords -- Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord
Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Slynn of Hadley, and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead
-- agreed.
Relatives broke down as the judgment was read out in the House of
Lords.

THE man responsible for IBM's worldwide manufacture of personal
computers, including the Spango Valley operation in Greenock, has quit
the company he first joined in 1968.
Mr John McClelland took over as vice-president manufacturing for IBM's
global PC business only last August. In his new role, Mr McClelland was
responsible for facilities in Australia, China, Japan, and Mexico, as
well as Greenock and the Raleigh plant in North Carolina.
Unlike other recent high-level departures from IBM, Glasgow-born Mr
McClelland, 49, does not appear to have been sacked by the management of
the multinational, led by chairman Lou Gerstner.
Mr McClelland, who was not available for comment yesterday, has
apparently resigned of his own free will. There was intense speculation
last night that he is joining rival computer manufacturer Digital,
possibly to head its European operations.
The fact he has chosen to leave such a high-status post, carrying a
salary of more than #200,000 a year, after a lifetime with IBM, raises
the prospect of further upheaval within the company's PC business -- an
upheaval which could carry important implications for the Greenock
operation.
Mr McClelland, who was plant director at Greenock between 1987 and
1990, was instrumental in setting up the deal whereby Rangers' chairman
David Murray's Mimtec subsidiary took over a major factory at Gourock
and became a satellite assembly plant for IBM at Greenock.
He was awarded the CBE in the 1994 New Year's Honours List.
If he is joining Digital, close observers are at a loss to explain why
McClelland should turn his back on 27 years with IBM, a global
management challenge he has scarcely begun to tackle, and a large
six-figure salary, to join a rival which is, arguably, in even more
difficulties than IBM.
Digital has only a toehold in the PC business and recently sold its
South Queensferry silicon wafer plant to Motorola. It has lost money
heavily recently and is even deeper in the throes of corporate
restructuring than IBM.
Inevitably, there is speculation that Mr McClelland may have left
because he disagrees with the future strategy for IBM's PC business.
Insiders say the Greenock plant did not have a good fourth quarter,
failing to meet its production targets by about 46,000 units.
Output at the Raleigh plant in the US also fell short of budget. The
Mimtec plant was running short of IBM work late last year.
Until the circumstances of Mr McClelland's departure are made clearer,
the unsettling speculation over what it all means for IBM at Greenock
will continue.

ANIMAL rights activists were celebrating last night after Shoreham
Port Authority announced it was scrapping the contract to ship live
animals from the West Sussex harbour.
The decision is expected to end weeks of angry protests which have led
to scores of arrests as protesters attempted to stop shipments of calves
and sheep.
Comedian Spike Milligan joined the protest yesterday and vowed to defy
his 76 years by standing in front of a lorry if necessary, to stop what
he called an ''abominable cruelty''.
However, in a statement issued last night, the authority said it had
resolved to give formal notice to International Traders Ferries, the
company which chartered the cargo vessel Northern Cruiser to take
animals to France.
The notice, said the statement, would take effect at the end of the
three-month contract agreed with the shippers. It is thought the
contract has another 30 days to run.
However, the authority said it had organised immediate talks with ITF
to discuss ''arrangements to be made for the operation of the contract
for the remainder of its term''.
The aim of the talks, it said, would be to end the ''serious adverse
consequences which have begun to emerge for all other users of the port,
personnel of the port authority, and the Sussex Police''.
Police have had up to 1000 officers a night on duty at the port to
control the demonstrations.
Chief Constable Paul Whitehouse was among those to publicly condemn
the veal trade during a news conference to outline the cost of the
protests.
Animal rights campaigners maintaining a vigil at the port last night
were overjoyed at the news. Ms Donna Wolven, 29, from Brighton, said:
''It is absolutely fantastic.''

SIX hundred people at Rolls-Royce's East Kilbride plant yesterday
discovered an awful truth as they lost their jobs -- doing better work,
more efficiently and cheaply than their English counterparts, is just
not good enough.
It was a lesson greeted at first with incredulity, then bitterness, by
highly skilled staff at one of Scotland's best-regarded engineering
research and design centres. The division will close and the work
transfer to Derby and Bristol.
Eighteen months ago, some of Derby's operations switched to East
Kilbride, which later underlined its economic strengths by winning work
on a new aero engine project against competition from other Rolls-Royce
plants.
Since then, many of the Lanarkshire white-collar staff have been
working overtime, including Sundays, to meet the healthy -- and
profitable -- order book.
They are sure their jobs have been sacrificed to save the Derby plant,
where design teams are underemployed after completing work on the Trent
series, Rolls-Royce's most powerful engine, developed for the A330 and
Boeing 777.
Unions suspect that Rolls-Royce's joint venture with BMW is also
behind the transfer south to plants said to have received much more
investment in high-technology equipment than East Kilbride in recent
years. They believe Derby will now develop a new generation of aero
engines -- based on East Kilbride's BR710 and BR715 designs -- for
rapidly growing markets in 100-seater aircraft.
There is no doubt that the company will press ahead with the job cuts
and the transfer to England, regardless of the growing furore
surrounding the decision, taken in the utmost secrecy which was
shattered by yesterday's exclusive report in The Herald.
Management have now hinted that further rationalisation cannot be
ruled out under a relentless drive to improve Rolls-Royce's business
performance and efficiency.
Executives had kept plans to axe the division so secret they did not
even tell Scottish Office officials or the Secretary of State for
Scotland of their intentions in advance.
Such a warning would normally be necessary if there were any grant
implications in the job losses. Even in cases where no grant aid is
involved, it is still normal courtesy to inform the Government of job
losses on this scale.
Although Rolls-Royce at East Kilbride did get some Scottish Office
grant assistance last year to support overhaul work on the V2500 series
engine, the latest news came ''like a bolt from the blue'', as one civil
servant put it.
That wall of secrecy is being interpreted, in official circles, as an
indication of the strength of Rolls-Royce's determination to push the
rationalisation and the Scottish job cuts through unaltered. ''Their
minds are made up and closed,'' said one source.
The executives who travelled north from Derby on Wednesday to break
the devastating news to workers at East Kilbride the next morning first
met local plant managers at the Forte Crest Hotel at Glasgow Airport on
the Wednesday evening to brief them.
For four hours that evening, The Herald made exhaustive efforts to
confirm with Rolls-Royce what we knew of the secret plans. We even sent
a reporter to the hotel seeking confirmation.
However, despite all our efforts, the Rolls-Royce team took a decision
not to speak to us or to return our numerous calls. Instead, they sent
representatives to Albion Street to pick up copies of our first edition.
In this instance, their deafening silence spoke as eloquently as any
words.
Mr John Ferry, director of manufacturing business, at an impromptu
news conference yesterday, said of the redundancies: ''It is regrettable
from the personal standpoint of the people involved. But the company has
to improve its competitiveness. That means reducing costs and improving
the way it does business. It has to do more with less.
''We did not come to this decision lightly . . . we need to improve
business and efficiency and if that involves the need for further
rationalisation, then we will do so.''
It is unlikely, under the rationalisation, that more than 100 staff
will be found jobs at Derby, Bristol, or any other Rolls-Royce plants,
including its six Scottish sites where 4000 are employed.
Asked why Rolls-Royce could take out the Lanarkshire division after
acknowledging that research, development, and design were the company's
key to future prosperity, Mr Ferry replied: ''It is our judgment that
all the capability needed will be provided at Derby and Bristol.''
He insisted that the transfer of the development and design centre
would not affect the security of the 1000 left at the East Kilbride
plant's separate engine repair and overhaul division.
The axe fell on 500 highly skilled engineers and designers and 100
shopfloor and store workers at precisely 8.15am yesterday -- 15 minutes
after starting work. It should have been a surprise -- but for The
Herald revelations that the division would be wound up and moved to
Derby, with at best 100 of the 600 jobs saved.
Technical author Graham Meikle, 31, of McLean Place, Paisley, who has
a five-year-old daughter, echoed the views of many of his colleagues
when he insisted after leaving a management briefing: ''We were told
that we do a better job, more efficiently and cheaper, and that we made
record profits in the last couple of years.
''But they also said Derby will do our jobs. We have been let down,
kicked in the teeth.''
Opposition MPs and unions immediately announced they would fight the
closure tooth and nail. Industrial action will be considered. Of equal
concern is the loss to Scotland's manufacturing base of so many skilled
people -- and the blow to the local economy of such highly paid people,
whose salaries range from #17,000 to more than #40,000, losing their
jobs.
The rundown is expected to begin in May and be completed by the end of
the year.
Lanarkshire Development Agency, charged with economic regeneration in
a county still badly affected by the closure of Ravenscraig steelworks,
likened the shutdown to taking two steps forward and three steps back at
a time when large investments had been attracted to East Kilbride.
''The scale of redundancies is a bitter blow to East Kilbride and the
Lanarkshire economy as a whole,'' said the LDA's chief executive, Mr
Archie Bethel. ''The area can ill afford to lose jobs of this quality.''
East Kilbride Development Corporation -- which in past crisis has
redoubled efforts to attract replacement industries -- disappears later
this year. Its chief executive, Mr John Shaw, recalled that the new town
was built around Rolls-Royce, and added: ''The job losses are
significant and will be a major challenge for agencies to replace.''
Mr Shaw described the loss of research and design jobs, vital to
Scotland's prosperity, as extremely disappointing, and went on: ''This
rationalisation is significant. We have worked hard to attract jobs like
that to East Kilbride. It's a tough time for the town and, the more we
suffer, the harder it is to get the rest of the county going as well.''
Councillor Colin Robb, Labour leader of East Kilbride District
Council, said it was ''devastating news which no-one had expected''.
He will seek meetings with management over recent speculation that
Derby feared it would lose 500 jobs soon. He will also ask why the BR700
series for regional jets under the BMW joint venture, to replace East
Kilbride's Tay 600 series, cannot go to Lanarkshire.
The Scottish design centre's most recent successes are the Tay engine,
which won the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement for the
five-year period to April 1993, and the multi-national consortium V2500
unit. Its closure will leave East Kilbride only as an overhaul and
repair base for engines currently in service.
In a terse, four paragraph announcement yesterday, the company said
the reduction in East Kilbride aerospace operations was needed to
maintain its drive to improve performance and enhance its
competitiveness.
It said the company and outside agencies would offer a broad package
of measures to help employees retrain and find other work.
Development engineer Steve Watson, 36, of Kirkhill, Cambuslang, who
has worked at the plant for 15 years, said he found only two similar
posts advertised in newspapers yesterday.
He added: ''There is a lot of anger in there. We feel betrayed and
gutted. It came as a shock. There is plenty of work to keep us going but
it's moving to Derby because its work has finished.
''It's definitely anti-Scottish. There is no business case for it. We
make profit, Derby makes a loss.''

The loss of up to 650 jobs at Rolls-Royce's East Kilbride plant has
stunned the workforce.
THERE was a bitter wind and flurries of snow yesterday afternoon as Mr
Tom Jamieson left the Rolls-Royce factory in East Kilbride and drove out
towards a bleak mid-winter.
The senior development engineer was only one of the 600 men and women
told by Rolls-Royce management that their jobs were to be
''rationalised''. It is a soft word which folds easily round the facts.
With his colleagues, Mr Jamieson, a Rolls-Royce employee for more than
20 years, faces redundancy.
''It's like a betrayal,'' he said last night in his Clarkston home.
''My job isn't being made redundant. It's just me. We are losing our
jobs in order to minimise job losses in Derby.''
The 36-year-old father of three found out about the proposed
redundancies when cuttings of The Herald's front page story were
circulated round his department before he began his 8am shift.
Shortly afterwards, a series of announcements were made by senior
management and unions which confirmed the bad news. Official word is
that the jobs will be phased out in the second half of next year. Mr
Jamieson heard rumours that it could begin in May.
Surrounded by his wife, Sheila, and three children, Leigh, 17, Nicola,
14, and Thomas, seven, he described his thoughts on the short drive
home.
''You don't know how to feel. Everything flashes in front of you. How
are you going to support your family? How will you pay the mortgage?
What can we cut back on?''
Nicola wishes to attend university. He does not yet know if this will
be possible. He expects he will have to move out of a house he may no
longer be able to afford. They had planned to buy a new car but this is
now cancelled. Holidays, previously a bi-annual treat, have been
forgotten.
''I recently changed my mortgage because the situation at East
Kilbride looked buoyant. We just didn't know what was in store for us.''
Mr Jamieson was 16 years old, just out of Lourdes High School, and
dating Sheila when he joined the firm's Hillington plant in 1974. He
worked as an apprentice on lathes before rising from the shop floor to a
section leader in engine development.
''I loved working for Rolls- Royce and working in the aerospace
industry. You have a real sense of pride. It's at the top end of
technology and you are working with the best materials and the best
designs on something that can carry a couple of hundred people 33,000ft
above the ground. I was proud, but all that pride is now lost.''
Mrs Jamieson, 36, had the news broken by her husband, who called at
the office of House of Fraser in Glasgow where she works. Nicola heard
it on the radio while Leigh and Thomas found out at home.
''It's so depressing. You just feel like there is so much doom and
gloom and people just accept it and trudge on until it happens to them.
That is what happened to us,'' Mrs Jamieson said.
It is an accurate point reflected by a trip around the sprawling
walkways of East Kilbride shopping centre. Only a few people had heard
the news. Those who did expressed sympathy and disappointment but only a
few seemed truly shocked.
Ms Mary Mair, 66, of Westwood, standing in the cold outside Hunter
Health Centre, said: ''Nobody's jobs are safe right now. It's terrible
and it's a blow for the whole area. Jobs should be brought in, not
thrown out.''
Mr Paul Hill, 24, of Greenhills, was shopping with his young daughter
and said: ''I know a couple of lads who work at the plant and it's a
shame, but what can be done.''
In the Rolls-Royce foremen's working club among the full-size snooker
tables and bar stools, Ms Caroline Docherty, the steward, said it was a
shock which would affect everybody. She was preparing for a busy night
filling pints downed with depression.
As the snow picked up outside the gates at finishing time, a young
wife waited for her husband while their child slept in the car seat. She
said she could not talk, not now -- even the suggestion brought tears.
As the workers flooded out, heads held down against the driving snow
and avoiding questions, few said anything more than ''Disgusted'',
''Devastated'', ''Can't talk'', and ''How would you feel?''
One middle-aged development engineer explained his fears for the
future -- again how would his daughter attend university. He also said
management, in a cynical move, delivered new employee guidebooks to all
staff on Monday which explained how they were forbidden to speak to the
press.
Asked for his name, he said: ''Just write, Gutted, East Kilbride.''

THERE was no sense of victory or relief at the Derby plant after news
of East Kilbride's demise spread through the workforce, union officials
in the town said yesterday.
The 10,000 employees, who are themselves still facing some measure of
uncertainty over future cuts, were said to be surprised that the entire
aero-engine design unit in Scotland was to close and the research and
development jobs moulded into the Derby operation.
A total of 1200 jobs were lost at Derby last year and further losses
as part of the same cost-cutting programme have not been ruled out.
Unions, however, believe any further cuts could be achieved through
voluntary severance.
Mr Mick Walker, MSF chief negotiator at Derby, said: ''Everybody here
is surprised that it is being closed. Only 18 months ago, some of our
operation was moved from Derby to Scotland.
''Our sympathies are with everyone at East Kilbride. This sort of
thing is terribly traumatic and devastating to the local community. Of
course, we will do all we can to assist our colleagues in Scotland.''
Mr Walker said management at Derby had not yet given any indication
how many posts would be transferred south.
However, he had some hopeful news for any workers coming to Derby. ''I
don't think there will be any compulsory job losses in Derby this year.
Any reductions will probably be made by voluntary redundancies,'' he
said.
Management have made it clear they want to keep staffing at present
levels, with any work from East Kilbride being absorbed by the Derby
research and development team through improved performance.

A STATION master was found guilty yesterday of being drunk in charge
of Scotland's busiest railway station.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that Paul Cook, 33, turned up for duty at
Glasgow Central last July smelling of drink. His eyes were glazed and
his speech slurred.
The duty officer, who was being relieved by Cook at the end of his
shift, told the court he could not possibly have allowed him to take
charge of the station because of his condition and asked for him to be
breath tested.
The case is believed to have been the first prosecution of its kind at
Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Cook, of Whitehill Street, Dennistoun, was charged under a section of
the 1992 Transport and Works Act which makes it illegal for anyone to
have control over the movement of trains when their alcohol count
exceeds 35. The limit for a car driver is 80.
Sheriff Alexander McIlwain heard that Cook's count was almost twice
the railway limit. The court also heard that RailTrack employs a
company, Med Screen, to test employees for drink or drugs.
Cook was tested initially by British Transport Police and then taken
to a Strathclyde Police office to be tested on the Camic machine.
At the end of the prosecution evidence, Cook's lawyer, Miss Claire
Lynch, argued there was no case to answer because Cook was prevented
from taking up his position that night by his colleague and, therefore,
was not working.
However, procurator-fiscal depute David Teal said it was clear Cook
had intended to work because he turned up in uniform and was only
prevented from doing so by his colleague.
Sheriff McIlwain found Cook guilty and deferred sentence till February
8 for social inquiry and community service reports.

THE Prime Minister has conceded that he needs his nine Tory rebels
more than they need him.
There was no harassment of them yesterday, despite the fact that seven
of them voted against the Government in the key fisheries debate on
Wednesday night.
The rebels added insult to injury by summoning the media yesterday to
set out their policy for Britain in Europe -- an eight-point plan that
runs directly contrary to the views of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
and the Prime Minister.
Mr Major was taunted by Labour leader Tony Blair four hours later in
the Commons: ''Is there any honest basis upon which they can now return
to the Tory Whip, and if so what is it?,'' he asked.
The Prime Minister could only reply: ''There are many and varied views
on European policy in all political parties and right across the
country.''
However, it was an embarrassing day for the Government, which clearly
has no plan to get the nine rebels back from their exile to restore an
overall Commons majority.
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook exploited this situation in which
the rebels are not being threatened with further condign punishment
following their additional revolt on the issue of Spanish fishermen
being allowed more intrusion to traditional British waters.
''He offered his rebels an olive branch and today they snapped it in
two. The gang of eight has split the Tory Party wide open,'' he said.
''There can be no turning back for the rebels and no surrender with
dignity for John Major. You cannot paper over a chasm.''
Mr Blair, keen to regain control of the political initiative which he
has lost over the last fortnight, took up the Cook theme and challenged
the Prime Minister in the Commons.
He cast Mr Major as a piggy-in-the-middle, unable to make up his mind,
between the Tories hostile to Europe and Tories favourable to Europe.
There was no sign last night that there might be an early resolution
to Mr Major's problems with his rebels. The Government does not have a
concession to give them, nor do they have a concession that would be
significant to them.
Earlier, they got together to produce an alternative strategy on
Europe which they produced at a provocative news conference. They
declared eight aims which are not contrived to make Mr Major's position
any easier.
Their eight aims are:
* To tackle the Common Agricultural Policy -- ''an absurd and costly
protectionist racket'' by restoring responsibility for agriculture to
national governments.
* A similar repatriation of fishing policy to member states.
* An end to the right of the European Court to intervene in national
policies, particularly the right to make retrospective decisions.
* Member states should be allowed to ban the export of live animals.
* The European Parliament -- ''a costly nonsense'' -- should be
re-named the European Assembly and consist of MPs nominated from
national Parliaments.
* European Union treaties should not cover foreign affairs or defence.
* The basic principle of Economic and Monetary Union should be
scrapped with each nation arranging its own economic policies and
currency management.
* The EU budget should be ''severely curtailed'' and all
interventionist subsidies ended.
Ministers are sympathetic to some of these causes but are in no
position to promise delivering them. Ministers have decided only not to
harass the rebels further, but have no idea how this embarrassing revolt
can be ended.
While the eight insisted that they were not trying to ''bash'' the
Government, they also made it clear that they are in no hurry to regain
the party whip.
One of them, Mr Tony Marlow, Northampton North MP, warned: ''Unless
the Conservative Party gets its policies right on Europe, the
Conservative Government will not be re-elected at the next general
election.
''Our aim, our objective is to see a Conservative victory at the next
election,'' he added.
Apart from Mr Marlow, the other Tory rebels launching yesterday's s
sceptical shopping list were: Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay); Sir
Richard Body (Holland with Boston); Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow); Mr
Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills); Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend
East); Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood) and Nicholas Budgen
(Wolverhampton South-West).
Veteran Euro-doubter Sir Teddy said: ''What we're suggesting is a
constructive solution, not in any sense to try and bash the Government,
but simply to say 'There are huge problems here, we've got to face up to
it'.''

FEWER than half of the students at St Andrews and Edinburgh
universities were Scots as recently as two years ago, according to the
first detailed report on Scottish higher education.
It shows that 39% of students at St Andrews, 44% at Edinburgh, and 50%
at Stirling were Scots. At the other extreme, more than 90% of students
at the then five colleges of education were Scots.
Overall, nearly 70% of students at Scotland's higher education
institutions were Scots, falling to 67% if postgraduates were included.
At Strathclyde University in Glasgow, 81% of undergraduate and other
students were Scots.
The statistics confirm the strong tradition in Strathclyde region of
most students going to a university within a 30-mile radius of their
home town.
The report, compiled by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council,
is based on data for 1992-3, just before the body took responsibility
for disbursing public funds to the sector.
It confirms the popularity -- among students from other parts of the
UK and abroad -- of St Andrews, Edinburgh, and Stirling universities. At
St Andrews, mainly English students outnumbered those living in Scotland
and accounted for more than 46% of total student numbers.
At Edinburgh, mainly English students made up nearly 45% of the
student body. The university has been criticised in the past by the
Scottish National Party for recruiting too few Scottish-based students
and too many English ones.
In 1993, it set a target of at least 50% of students being
Scottishdomiciled and introduced a policy to market itself more
effectively in Scotland.
The SHEFC report uses the most recent figures to show that, including
continuing education courses, Glasgow University had more than 48,000
students on full-time and short courses, while Edinburgh had nearly
40,000.
Edinburgh, with 11,800, and Glasgow, with 12,300, accounted for a
quarter of undergraduates on full-time and sandwich courses.
Meanwhile, the Student Loans Company yesterday extended its new policy
ofopenness by meeting university chiefs, who have been highly critical
of the Government-funded scheme to encourage undergraduates to meet
increasing proportions of their living costs.
Its acting chief executive, Sir Eric Ash, told the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals that the current financial year's
problems, including the backlog in paying out loans to existing
students, were almost over.
He said the company was looking at a simplified system for processing
loans for existing borrowers but that it did not have much time to
produce it.
A spokesman for the CVCP said: ''It was a constructive meeting which
left us feeling that relations with the company, which have not been
good, may be about to improve.''
He said, however, that the loans system needed a fundamental overhaul,
particularly the repayment method. The CVCP called for a flexible,
affordable system which, the spokesman said, would help tackle student
poverty.

<HEADLINE>Epileptic died on Ben Nevis</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ''CLUMSY and awkward'' epileptic climbed Ben Nevis alone after
ignoring advice not to do so and slipped down an ice field to his death
while descending from the 4408ft summit.
An accidental death verdict was recorded at Southwark Coroner's Court
in South London yesterday into the death of Mr Peter Ward, 41, a housing
officer, of Southwark. His cousin, Mr Marcus Wysock-Wright, said Mr Ward
was ''renowned to be clumsy and awkward in movement -- always spilling
cups of coffee''.
New Zealand-born Mr Ward had completed a sailing course at an outward
bound centre in Loch Eil, near Fort William, but stayed on for a few
days to climb the mountain.
He was found dead in a stream at 3500ft on Ben Nevis on July 3. He had
earlier reached the summit. Constable Michael Stocking said Mr Ward had
been advised not to attempt a climb.
''A witness was aware of his medical condition and attempted to
persuade him not to go,'' he said. ''He persisted and wanted to borrow a
rucksack.''The witness agreed to lend him one on four conditions -- that
he would ascend and descend by the tourist path, that he would only do
it if the weather was good, that he would return if the weather broke,
and would be back by 4.30pm.''
Mr Ward set off on Saturday, July 2, alone and, when he still had not
returned the following day, the mountain rescue team was alerted.
''He was found on the south side of Ben Nevis in an area of snow,''
said Mr Stocking. ''He was on his back in a stream with head injuries.
There was no sign of life.
''He made it to the summit safely but when he attempted to descend he
slipped and was unable to stop himself.''
Dr Richard Shepherd said it seemed as though Mr Ward had ''slithered
down an ice field and hit his head at the bottom near the stream''.

SCOTLAND is to gain more than 200 jobs with a #22m investment which
will put Dundee at the forefront of biomedical research.
The new institute, which is being made possible by what is believed to
be the largest charitable donation yet made in Scotland, will seek to
uncoverthe causes of a range of diseases, including cancer, diabetes,
arthritis, and hereditary skin diseases.
It is also expected that the institute will start a ''reverse brain
drain'', and top scientists in their field from around the world have
already been headhunted to lead research groups to find the proteins and
enzymes that cause pain and death.
The investment will confirm Dundee University's biochemistry
department as a world leader and bring the number of people employed in
biomedicine throughout Dundee up to 1300, making it Britain's
fourth-largest biomedical centre after Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh.
The development, announced yesterday by university principal Dr Ian
Graham-Bryce, was made possible by a #10m donation from the Wellcome
Trust.
It is believed to be the largest charitable donation yet in Scotland
and will go towards the cost of building a six-storey laboratory
complex. The trust, which already supports research at Dundee, will
provide a further #10m in research grants over the next five years.
In addition, the university, Tayside Regional Council, and Scottish
Enterprise Tayside are contributing #2m towards construction costs.
Dr Graham-Bryce said: ''Two hundred new scientists will add up to
enormous research firepower. It is a tremendous vote of confidence in
the work that is carried out in Dundee.
''We are proud of the calibre of people we have here. They include
scientific superstars and this development will allow us to attract a
host of others.
''We will be bringing back a number of scientists from abroad in a
welcome reversal of the brain drain.''
The building will be completed in two years and will be next to the
biochemistry department on the university campus.
Yesterday's announcement was a personal triumph for 49-year-old
Professor Philip Cohen, the biochemist who has helped build Dundee's
biochemistry department up to 220 scientists over the last 23 years, and
who is hotly tipped for as a future Nobel prize-winner.
Rated as one of the world's top 100 scientists, he and his colleagues
spent four years persuading the Wellcome Trust to back the Dundee
initiative.
Professor Cohen explained: ''Our main aim is to conduct the
fundamental biological research to find the causes of a range of
diseases. Arising from this, practical ideas and collaboration can
result to find cures and treatments.''
Earlier this week, Professor Cohen's wife, Dr Tricia Cohen, who works
beside her husband was in the news when a woman who was a neighbour
during Tricia's childhood left #350,000 to assist the Cohens' research
work.
The money was used to establish a laboratory named after Miss Marian
Brunskill, a recluse who had never met Mrs Cohen and who had only seen
the young girl from her window as she retrieved her ball from her
garden.

A COOL pilot saved the lives of all 18 people aboard his helicopter
yesterday when he calmly brought his stricken aircraft down into the sea
and then ushered those on board to safety.
The emergency began when the Bristow's Tiger helicopter was struck by
lightning at 3000ft over the North Sea storm and was forced to ditch in
14ft waves.
Bristow's last night named the two crewmen who were flying the
helicopter.
Senior First Officer Lionel Sole, 39, who has been with Bristow's for
five years, was at the controls at the time of the crash.
Captain Cedric Roberts, 44, who has more than 20 years' flying
experience, was the other crew member. Both men live in the Aberdeen
area.
''The skill and professionalism of the crew prevented this incident
from becoming a catastrophe. These are extremely lucky people,''
aviation journalist Jim Ferguson said last night.
The Tiger -- Bristow's version of the Aerospatiale Super Puma -- was
on its way from Aberdeen to Marathon's Brae Alpha platform when it was
hit during a lightning storm.
After sending out a Mayday, the pilot brought the helicopter down in
the sea 142 miles north-east of Aberdeen and about 22 miles from Brae
Alpha in near gale force winds at 12.37pm yesterday. Nearly 90 minutes
later, passengers and crew were safely aboard the stand-by vessel
Grampian Freedom.
Later, one of the flotation bags burst and the helicopter sank in
around 200ft five miles from the Brae platform.
A Bristow Helicopters spokesman said all 16 passengers and two crewmen
arrived back in Aberdeen last night shortly after 8pm aboard two
helicopters.
Three doctors travelled with the passengers although none was thought
to have been injured in the ditching. They left by coach to be debriefed
at a nearby hotel.
The spokesman said the two crewmen were being met by air accident
investigators for an initial debriefing.
When the helicopter ditched in the water, its air collar inflated as
designed to keep the aircraft afloat.
The pilots reminded the passengers of the safety briefing they had
undergone little more than an hour earlier at Aberdeen heliport. They
launched the inflatable life-raft through the jettisoned main door, and
calmly climbed in.
RAF, coastguard, and civilian helicopters went to the scene, as did
several surface vessels. At 1.32pm, the fast rescue craft from the
stand-by vessel, Grampian Freedom, arrived alongside the life-raft and
began transferring them to the Grampian Freedom.
The fast rescue craft from another vessel, the St Patrick, also helped
in the operation.
Captain Tony Jones, Bristow's general manager in Aberdeen, said that
helicopter pilots would normally attempt to avoid storm cells which show
up on their weather radar as ''red blobs''.
However, lightning had not been predicted for the area in which they
were flying at the time of the strike.
He said that helicopters were hit twice or three times a year by
lightning but it generally caused little or no damage.
''Quite often the lightning strikes the aircraft through the main or
tail rotor and does very little damage,'' he added.
All Bristow aircraft are fitted with integrated health and usage
monitoring systems and part of this equipment is a flight data recorder
-- black box -- which tells the exact history of the flight and efforts
may be made today to recover this equipment.
Although the helicopter was secured to the Highland Pride supply
vessel when the bag burst, it capsized, filled with water, and sank,
breaking the ropes.
''I can only assume the pilot put it into the water only as a result
of some sort of damage which made the continued flight of the aircraft
hazardous. He was, after all, only 22 miles from the Brae and if he
could have carried any damage he would have done so to the Brae.
''It could have been a fairly easy exercise if the damage was limited
to vibration. However, there is some hint that immediately prior to
landing on the water the tail rotor may have suffered some malfunction
which could have been ascribed to the lightning strike.
''What is clear is the pilots performed in a workmanlike manner --
they stuck by the drills.
''One crew who were airborne at the same time could hear a pilot
talking to the passengers and giving them instructions on safety
procedures, how to get the dinghy out, how to get the windows out and
how to jettison the main doors through which I believe everyone escaped.
''I think it is important to mention that throughout the history of
North Sea operations on both this side and the Norwegian side nobody has
lost his or her life in a ditching whether it be a controlled or
uncontrolled one. It is clear in this situation the helicopters have
performed very well and so have the crew.''
Captain Jones said that last year the company refitted its entire
fleet of Tigers with tail rotor blades of an improved design which is
meant to be more damage tolerant than before.
''If that was what was the cause of this incident, the lightning
strike must have been quite different from the ones we have experienced
in the past.''
Mr Dennis Royle, Marathon's safety manager, said that the first
helicopter was on the scene at 1.05pm, a fast rescue craft was on scene
by 1.32 and by 2.04 it had confirmed that all passengers and crew were
safe aboard the Grampian Freedom.
''There were no injuries reported. The reports from the field are that
many of them were seasick and rather upset as you might expect but there
were no injuries.''

PROFESSOR Philip Cohen, 49, is seriously regarded as a future Nobel
laureate. Two of his biggest supporters, Edmund Fisher and Edwin Krebs,
received the prize in 1992 for their pioneering work and sustained
development in reversible protein phosphorylation, a key area in
cellular metabolism with applications in fighting a wide range of
diseases, from asthma to cancer.
It was as a newly married couple in 1969 that Philip and Patricia
Cohen -- after meeting as undergraduates at University College, London
-- went to work with Fisher and Krebs at the University of Washington in
Seattle, branching out on their own to continue the research in Dundee
from 1971.
Professor Cohen was widely described as a third potential winner of
the prize in 1992, although he modestly asserted then that ''no-one
beside them should have got it'', and continues to maintain that the
importance of his work is in ''benefiting mankind''.
Nevertheless, Dr Krebs and Dr Fisher, who opened up the field in the
1950s, maintain that its progress in world science has been due to the
work of the Cohens, and their training of many experts now pre-emininent
in their own right. As members of the Nobel nomination proceedure, they
cannot come out openly to declare their conviction that Philip Cohen
should receive Nobel recognition, but their strong advocacy for his case
is an open secret.
Dr Krebs paid this tribute yesterday from Seattle: ''Philip Cohen's is
one of the first names that would come to mind as pre-eminent in the
field of science throughout the world.
''Although we were fortunate enough to make the discovery, its
development has depended on people like Professor Cohen. I would not
think of him in terms of a competitor but, if I did, he would be a
worthy one. He is a brilliant scientist and a delightful man, a hard
worker who demands a lot of his people and impeccably honest.''
Four years ago, the Institute for Scientific Information named
Professor Cohen within the list of the world's most highly cited
scientists of the previous decade, an equation arrived at by a count of
references by peers to his research papers and one book, Control Of
Enzyme Activity (1976). He was ranked 66th in the world, and New
Scientist published the list under the heading Scientific Superstars.
The as yet unnamed institute at Dundee University to be headed by
Professor Cohen will recruit 240 scientists working in more than 20
teams under top-flight experts (reversing the brain drain by targeting
expatriates) between now and 1998. The enhancing of his international
standing will be guaranteed.
The Medical Research Council issued a statement yesterday, welcoming
the #22m research funding: ''We are pleased to see that Professor Cohen
has received further recognition of the high regard with which he is
held in the scientific community.''

THE chief executive of Lochaber District Council, Mr David Blair, has
been dismissed with effect from this morning for his management of
certain council projects over the past five years which finally cost
#550,000 more than anticipated.
His sacking followed two meetings of the council's disciplinary
committee in Fort William, one before Christmas and one last week.
Council chairman Neil Clark stressed yesterday the decision by the
three councillors who attended had been unanimous. He described the
disciplinary procedures as a model and said he was certain the right
decision had been taken.
He added: ''We could not carry on with Mr Blair as chief executive.
Relations between him and the majority of councillors and with other
chief officers had broken down to such an extent that it just couldn't
work.''
However, the decision has already divided the 15-member council, with
seven opposed to the move in September to suspend Mr Blair pending
inquiries. Two of these subsequently refused to serve on what should
have been a disciplinary committee of five.
Mr Blair, who has held the #43,000 job for 11 years, is to appeal. He
said last night: ''I have refuted all the allegations against me in
writing and in front of the disciplinary committee. But all my evidence
has been completely ignored, as have the GMB union's demand for an
independent inquiry.
''All along, I have been prepared to submit my conduct and my actions
to the scrutiny of a full and independent inquiry but the council, by a
majority of one, has refused my request. I have absolutely nothing to
hide and can only presume that those who refuse to accept an independent
inquiry have everything to hide. I have been victimised for doing my job
without fear or favour to anyone.''
Mr Robert Parker, GMB Scotland's chief negotiator for Scottish local
authorities, said: ''It has been clear to us from the moment David Blair
was suspended four months ago that the SNP-led majority on this council
were determined to dismiss him.''
He said they would appeal against the decision.
Mr Clark told The Herald last night there had been two contracts for
repairs to the Swedish houses at Caol. These cost the council #500,000
more than originally estimated in 1989.
An internal auditors' report claimed Mr Blair had failed in his duty
by: not ensuring the initial contract sum was minuted; not ensuring
reports were made to committee of estimated costs of extra work; by not
reporting to the committee before reversing a decision to withhold
retention cash.
In 1990, the council considered a scheme to build 12 houses on land at
Ballachulish and entered into negotiation with a company called Donmar.
However, in August of that year, the director of finance reported the
firm had an issued share capital of two and had not filed any accounts
since its incorporation in January 1988. The council ended up paying
more than #22,000 to get out of the deal. Mr Blair was alleged to have
failed to protect the council's interests and to seek or take advice
which might have led to the contract being closed down earlier.
Another venture at Caol to buy up to 18 houses resulted in a further
#30,000 of unexpected expenditure. The investigating committee had felt
Mr Blair failed to ensure the contract adequately protected the council
in the event of the houses being unsold.
Mr Clark said Mr Blair had also sent a letter to the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities and the Controller of Audit in April and July
of last year which was critical of the majority group of councillors. It
had been sent at the behest of one of the seven councillors and its
substance related to the fact the majority group was setting up a
committee to examine Mr Blair's management record.
''He shouldn't have been anywhere near that letter when it concerned
himself,'' Mr Clark claimed.
