ROMARIO, the Brazilian World Cup star, is to leave Barcelona and
return home to join Flamengo, whose chairman has reached financial
agreement with the Spanish champions.
The striker, who was influential in Brazil's World Cup triumph, has
scored only four goals this season after a dazzling 30-goal first
campaign for Barcelona last year.
Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach said: ''When a player tells you
clearly he wants to go, you can't tie him down. You have to understand
him and look for a solution.''
* PARMA striker Faustino Asprilla is to return to his native Colombia
this week to face questioning over the alleged illegal possession of
firearms.
Prosecutors in Colombia are investigating an incident on New Year's
Eve in which Asprilla was reported to have been found drunk in a bar
brandishing two pistols and provoking other customers.
* SAINT Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock yesterday announced that new
team captain Davie Irons had signed an extension to his contract with
the first division club. The 33-year-old has got his career back on the
tracks after a serious injury kept him out for much of last season.

ANDY Goram on crutches and Mark Hateley booked to see a specialist in
London on Thursday. Also, seven other players are cluttering up the
Ibrox treatment room.
Even Rangers, with their famed and often fabled squad of players which
is said to have remarkable depth and strength, must be affected
significantly when almost enough men to make up a team are out because
of injuries and, although manager Walter Smith remains remarkably
stoical as his difficulties mount, he will have to do something soon to
alleviate the problem.
Smith will have to decide whether to wait until the close season, the
normal harvesting period for managers with money to spend, or make a
move into the transfer market now. Circumstances are dictating to Smith,
who can't afford to operate much longer without an experienced and
prolific striker.
Rangers had to play at Firhill last Saturday without Hateley, Ally
McCoist, Gordon Durie, and Brian Laudrup, who will be the first of this
quartet back in action but even he won't play in Saturday's game against
Falkirk at Brockville.
The Dane is on international duty -- he scored against Saudi Arabia at
the weekend -- while Hateley and McCoist are nursing injuries. Durie,
who is fit again, now finds he is suspended for the next two matches.
Smith clearly has problems in forging a frontline and had to use two
apprentice players, Brian McGinty and Scott Wilson, against Partick
Thistle.
McGinty, recognised as a midfield player, had to be used up front and
Wilson was one of the substitutes giving Rangers' first-team group a
rather fragile appearance.
If Hateley's specialist tells him his groin problem requires further
rest and if McCoist, who has never enjoyed good health since having
broken a leg playing for Scotland against Portugal in April '93, is
unable to shake off his calf muscle problem, Smith's hand could be
forced sooner than he would wish.
Undoubtedly, he is waiting until he has off-loaded perhaps one or two
more players before bringing the complement back up to strength and he
was probably sitting back planning his moves, which would be
significant, but the sort of performances which saw Rangers draw against
Celtic and then Thistle can't be dismissed easily.
They may have points to squander, but Rangers would be unwise to drop
too many as they reach out for another championship trophy.
Goram, who was taken off at Firhill, will be sidelined for two to
three weeks and if Rangers are not scoring freely then their opponents
would feel more confident than normal about pushing forward and testing
stand-in keeper Colin Scott.
Goram has injured the same calf muscle, but in a different place,
which he damaged playing for Scotland in their last international match,
against Greece in December.
Smith said he was not overly concerned about Goram's injury but, when
taken as a whole, his casualty list is hardly bedtime reading. Trevor
Steven, who has not played this season, has resumed training but is not
yet ready for a first-team recall, Alexei Mikhailichenko is still
recuperating, Basile Boli has tweaked a knee ligament and is doubtful
for Saturday, as is Richard Gough, who has sore ribs.
Also, Charlie Miller has a lower back injury which is restricting his
movement and if he doesn't recover in time to play against Falkirk it is
likely Ian Ferguson, himself not long back after a lengthy injury, will
be asked to play up front.
In trying to find solutions and maintain a degree of familiarity about
the team's playing patterns, Smith is not helped by the sale of Pieter
Huistra to Hiroshima, of the J League, but these are the risks big-club
managers sometimes have to take. When the offer was made for Huistra,
who leaves after Saturday's match, Rangers' injury problems appeared to
be easing, but suddenly they have become severe again.
Duncan Ferguson, who was sold to Everton recently, waited more than a
year to try to win a striking role for Rangers and, just after his move
south, fate has denied the club use of either their first-choice
strikers.
It is this kind of misfortune which makes it increasingly difficult
for Smith, who has taken in something like #6m in sales, to stay out of
the transfer market.
One of the players he sold off, Steven Pressley, who went to Coventry
City for #600,000, must be wishing he had been allowed to stay at Ibrox
because the central defender has struggled to adapt to the English game
and is now being criticised strongly by his manager, Phil Neal.
In 12 matches since moving, Pressley has been cautioned seven times
and sent off once. The former Scotland Under-21 captain's capacity to
learn from mistakes is now being brought into question.
He denied Coventry a win in the FA Cup by conceding a penalty to West
Bromwich Albion, who drew 1-1, and Neal's patience snapped. ''We in
England are in a position now to watch Scottish games on television -- I
watched last week's match between Rangers and Celtic and it seems to me
Steven has come from an environment in which the tackle from behind is
still being allowed. He has to understand he can't be rash,'' he said.
''He must adjust accordingly, but if you look at his seven bookings
they were all for tackles which were rash or from behind. He simply
cannot do that.
''He also has to learn quickly that he is no longer playing for
Rangers in Scotland, where he could have had 20 minutes of relaxation
because his team were always dominating games. It's different here
because we are having to defend and he has to concentrate for 90 minutes
against better opposition.
''Steven is now coming up against Cantona, Shearer, Wright, Cole, and
Klinsmann on regular basis.''
The former Liverpool defender added that he doesn't want to take away
from Pressley's determined approach because that was one of the
qualities which made him buy the player. However, Neal did say: ''He
doesn't have to jump in rashly because he has the pace to get up
alongside forwards.
''But he has to learn this quickly. He is in a different environment
and he must adapt.''

GOALS from Mark Hughes and Eric Cantona were enough to send Manchester
United into the fourth round of the FA Cup when the beat Sheffield
United 2-0 at Bramall Lane last night.
But Sheffield manager Dave Bassett thought it could have been
different had Charlie Hartfield not been sent off.
The midfield player was shown a red card after 12 minutes for striking
Cantona, and although the home team held out for more than an hour, they
were sunk for a second consecutive season by late goals.
''Charlie said he got tapped on the ankle and reacted, which he
shouldn't have done,'' said Bassett. ''You can't retaliate and he knows
he cost us the game. He'll feel very sorry for himself when he realises
exactly what he has done, and he'll be even sorrier when he's banned for
three matches and loses a weeks' wages.
''His actions cost us dearly. We might still have lost 2-0 but who
knows? I don't care whether it was Eric Cantona or Mickey Mouse who
tapped his ankles. You can't go round taking the law into your own
hands.''
Both goals were set up by Ryan Giggs, now showing the touch that has
eluded him all season, and Old Trafford manager Alex Ferguson, preparing
for Premiership games with Newcastle and Blackburn, was further boosted
by the comebacks of Peter Schmeichel and Lee Sharpe.
* MANCHESTER United remain 9-2 favourites to win the cup after last
night's match. Other odds are: 6-1 Liverpool, 7-1 Blackburn, 8-1
Tottenham, 10-1 Arsenal, 12-1 Newcastle, 14-1 others.

A UNIQUE event at Westminster this week, an SNP news conference for
the exclusive benefit of the English media, will underline the way the
constitutional debate has now reached critical mass south of the Border.
The move comes in the wake of the Prime Minister's decision to place
the protection of the Union at the heart of his next General Election
campaign and his Scottish Ministers' promise to take the arguments into
the English shires.
Labour too is showing the first signs of critical rumblings on the
issue, with Tam Dalyell resurrecting his West Lothian question and some
English activists beginning to question openly for the first time
whether they want regional assemblies in the South, or any
constitutional change as an early priority after winning power.
Scottish Nationalists have often staged events for the benefit of the
overseas press corps but it is understood that Thursday's lunchtime
gathering in the Jubilee Room at Westminster will be the first to have
been organised specifically for English journalists and broadcasters.
It is not seen, however, as an aggressive pitch at the Auld Enemy,
according to SNP leader Alex Salmond, who promised a cordial atmosphere.
''It will be carried out in a polite, pleasant manner against a
background of mutual esteem and respect,'' he said.
He will share a platform with the party's parliamentary group leader,
Mrs Margaret Ewing, foreign affairs spokesman Dr Allan Macartney MEP,
and the party's new chief executive, Mr Michael Russell.
''Our event on Thursday with respect to the English media is seen as
part of a charm offensive to put across the view that independence isn't
just the best option for Scotland but for England as well.''
Mr Salmond said Mr Major was making a mistake in trying to whip up
anti-Scots sentiment in the South, where he believed most people were
sympathetic to the view that Scotland should not be held in the Union
against her will, although he claimed that Labour's devolution plans
were a ''botched job'' which were already ''fraying at the edges''.
Labour's Scottish general secretary, Mr Jack McConnell, hit back at
the ''arid disinformation campaign of the Tory and SNP twins''. He said:
''If they want a serious debate on devolution we are ready with a sound,
well-formulated set of proposals. We have achieved widespread consensus
with these through the Constitutional Convention.
''Those opposed to the achievable goal of a Scottish parliament,
whether it be by clinging to the status quo or promoting separatist
policies, are out of step and out of touch with the majority in
Scotland.''
But Mr Salmond said: ''The rhetoric used to appeal to Scottish
sentiment may sound nationalist, but the reality practised by the Labour
leadership is Unionist to the core.
''Labour leaders no longer argue about Scotland's Claim of Right and
the national case for a parliament. They talk instead of devolution as a
way to rescue the sinking ship of the Union, just as John Major argues
for no change in order to protect the British state.''

A SCHOOL board chairman last night came to the defence of a head
teacher who is appealing against a decision to remove him from his post.
Mr Jim McAnally said disciplinary action taken by Strathclyde region
against Mr Gerry McKenna, head teacher of St Columba's High in Gourock,
for three instances of mismanagement was severe.
The authority decided to remove Mr McKenna from St Columba's in
Renfrew division and transfer him to St Andrew's Secondary in Glasgow,
with conservation of salary, after he had been given a final warning.
Parents met last night to discuss the issue ahead of Mr McKenna's
appeal today against his demotion and transfer.
Mr McAnally, who is now self-employed after taking early retirement
from his post as maths adviser in Renfrew division, said the meeting was
being held to give parents more information about Mr McKenna's case.
He said: ''We felt that the penalty was extremely severe and that the
time-scale for implementation was far too hasty.'' Mr McKenna was due to
start his new job this week, but nothing will be done until councillors
on the Strathclyde appeals sub-committee decide whether to reject or
uphold his appeal.
When news of Mr McKenna's removal emerged, the board asked parents to
return forms it had sent to pupils' homes if they wanted a stay of
execution. He said there was a 70% return.
Mr McAnally said disciplinary action was taken after Strathclyde's
school's inspectorate, the quality assurance unit, visited the school
and made 10 recommendations, three of which had not been implemented
when inspectors made a follow-up visit.
Inspectors were extremely critical but the board chairman said Mr
McKenna had done a good job, given staffing difficulties at the time.
The second instance related to a failure to meet the deadline to send
50% of pupil university application forms to the clearing body, Ucas. Mr
McAnally said there were again staffing difficulties in the office at
what was a very busy time. The applications were accepted late.
The third related to a visit to the school by independent auditors who
examined the school books. They could not account for a sum of money,
although there has been no question of criminal activity. Mr McAnally
said certain procedures and practices had not been brought fully
forward.
He said: ''The staff seem to respect Mr McKenna as someone who is firm
but fair. He has great ability in dealing with parents and it is said
that he knows the name of every pupil in the school.''
A Strathclyde region official said: ''The regional council is the
employer of head teachers and between employers and employees there is a
legal duty to maintain confidentiality.
''That legal duty is not reduced on one side even if the other happens
not to observe it.'' Legal advice had confirmed the authority's duty
regarding confidentiality, he said. ''Therefore, we have abstained from
any comment on what are sensitive matters relating to an employee,'' he
said.

MORE people in Scotland watched live television coverage of an English
football match on Sunday than a Scottish game which was screened at the
same time, according to unofficial viewing figures released yesterday.
The figures showed that a total of 494,000 people in Scotland watched
the BBC coverage of the English FA Cup match between Newcastle United
and Blackburn Rovers, which had a UK network audience of 7.3 million.
Meanwhile, Scottish Television's coverage of the premier division
match between Motherwell and Hearts, which was also screened by Grampian
but not by Border, was watched by just 344,000 viewers.
The figures will come as a disappointment to the Scottish Football
League and Scottish Television, who recently signed a #3m contract for
the screening of matches and highlights.
The four-year contract, which became effective at the start of the
current football season, allows Scottish Television to screen seven live
Scottish league matches in a season, and also gives them access to
highlights of other matches.
Mr Peter Donald, secretary of the Scottish Football League, yesterday
attempted to play down the figures and said he was unable to comment on
their significance because he was not aware of their accuracy.
Referring to the screening of the two matches, and the live coverage
of an Italian football match on Channel 4, all partly coinciding -- the
Italian coverage finished after the two British programmes started -- Mr
Donald said of the number of people who watched the Motherwell-Hearts
match: ''I think that is a very reasonable figure in the
circumstances.''
He added that viewing figures for previous live matches -- the
Motherwell-Hearts game was the fourth to be screened under the present
contract -- had been ''excellent.''
A spokeswoman for Scottish Television said yesterday that she was
unable to comment on the figures.

THE man whose appreciation of Chris McCart's apparently uncanny skills
caused a mighty rumpus at Fir Park on Sunday, referee Louis Thow, has
managed to extricate himself, the Scottish League and Motherwell from an
awkward, and potentially explosive situation by calling off from duty at
the same ground on Friday.
By one of those coincidences as bizarre as the free kick he awarded
Hearts, Thow was scheduled to return as a linesman to the Lanarkshire
ground before the end of the week, but has called off for business
reasons.
Thow's decision on Sunday to declare McCart's despairing clearance as
a pass-back created a furore at the Fir Park game and led to Hearts'
winning goal.
The referee's view of the incident, seen by many thousands on
television, when McCart's spinning kick was caught high in the air by
keeper Steve Woods, infuriated the home support and it might have
required a prudent piece of diplomacy by the Scottish League to switch
the official from his duties at the same ground when Motherwell meet
another Edinburgh side, Hibs, in another live television contest.
However, the man himself was in touch with the authority yesterday
afternoon to indicate that he would not be available, and a tricky
situation has been averted.
Said League secretary Peter Donald who, under the rules, would have
found it difficult to change appointments made well in advance, said:
''We are aware that we would have had to face a delicate and awkward
question, but Mr Thow's withdrawal makes it unnecessaary for us to
answer it.''
Motherwell, who are maintaining a sensible silence about the whole
affair, even if the winning goal could cost them dearly when the points
are totted up at the end of the season, know there is no way open for
any kind of protest at the decision.
Although clubs in the past, including Celtic, have made official
requests for certain referees not to be given their matches to handle,
the authorities have always ignored such appeals, while at times
demoting the referee involved in due course.
Nor can the club do anything to retrieve the loss of the match,
otherwise there would be queues of protesting teams trying their luck in
the appeals room. The fact is that Mr Thow got it badly wrong but he was
not the first, nor will he be the last man in the middle to make a
blunder.
None the less, while the League cannot react to every controversial
incident by removing the official from the spotlight -- which would be
tantamount to acknowledging he was to blame -- they will be greatly
relieved that Thow's presence at Fir Park within five days of the
controversy, which could have incited some of the Motherwell fans, who
were angry enough on Sunday, has been avoided.
Motherwell's dignified attitude was also personified by manager Alex
McLeish who resolutely refused to gamble with his comments on the great
debate. The only reference he would make to it all was that he did not
think it would have any effect on his players' determination to get back
to winning form against Hibs.
''I think they know that even if that had not happened and we had
drawn, it would have been despite the fact that we didn't play well.''
McLeish is more concerned with what happens next, and in that context
he accepts that the side which has done so well for him this season has
lost a little of its momentum. ''We have gone off the boil,'' he said,
''Injuries and suspensions have had an effect and, although the lads who
have come in have not let us down, the changes have had an influence.''
McLeish does argue that his players are entitled to feel a little
proud that the attitude of teams who come to Fir Park has altered. ''I
suppose it is to their credit that teams come here to stop them playing
rather than to win the game themselves, but the challenge for them is to
overcome that.''
Motherwell will be able to include Jamie Dolan in their squad for the
game on Friday as he has completed his suspension and Brian Martin, who
has been absent through injury, could also be a contender to return.
Before then, the team at the other end of the table, Partick Thistle,
will try to do as well, maybe even better, against Dundee United at
Firhill tonight, than they did against Rangers on Saturday. That is a
tall order, of course , because they managed a commendable 1-1 draw with
the champions and face a team who have rediscovered a bit of form
themselves.
After their embarrassment at going down 4-0 Hibs, the Tannadice side
have drawn with Aberdeen and Celtic and are now in more confident frame
of mind.
Even so, manager Ivan Golac will not bring in his new Uruguyan
signing, Juan Ferreri, as he had contemplated. ''I think we will
introduce him to the substitutes' bench first of all,'' he said, despite
the fact that he has midfield problems.
Jim McInally, wanted by Hibs, has a groin injury and is doubtful while
Billy McKinlay is not yet fit to return. Dave Bowman, who hurt his thigh
in the 1-1 draw with Celtic, is likely to be fit.
Thistle may have to continue without Wayne Foster who missed out on
Saturday because of injury, but Alan Dinnie, who played well aginst
Rangers, is expected to recover from a knock. ''I had no quarrel with
the effort our lads put in against Rangers,'' said manager John Lambie,
''but I would like to see us create more chances.''

SCOTLAND'S newly-formed American football team has given seven
part-time players dream tickets to the World League, and the Scottish
Claymores will play their home games at Murrayfield, home of rugby north
of the Border.
They will play 10 matches in a six-club league, the first against
Rhein Fire, of Dusseldorf, on April 9.
Other cities involved are Barcelona, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and London,
whose Monarchs will play at White Hart Lane.
Seven Scottish players have been selected for the Scottish Claymores
by American coach Lary Kuharich. They are Scott Couper, John Letham,
Stephen McCusker, Gary McNey, Patrick Shields (all Glasgow), Don
Edmonston (Glenrothes), and Ben Torriero, born in Edinburgh but now
living in Harrogate.
Also joining the team as national coach is Mike Kenny, a Ministry of
Defence worker from Rosyth, who coached Fife 49ers. He was involved in
the selection process as the World League evaluated 600 players from 15
countries.
The players will fly to Georgia at the end of next month for a
four-week training camp, where they will join the American players who
make up the bulk of the squad.
Among the jobs of the players selected are a taxi driver, bus driver,
and a telecommunications worker. Gary McNey, who drives a bus in Glasgow
said: ''I'm giving up my job for six months but I don't see it as a
gamble. I'm hoping I will be playing for the Claymores.''
The side's general manager, Sandy Waters, said his side will play in
front of two stands, with Murrayfield's 67,000 capacity reduced to
32,000. ''We'd hope to have crowds of 20,000 to 25,000,'' he said.

AIRDRIE'S management team of Alex MacDonald and John McVeigh have
issued a promotion challenge -- to their own team.
Both have had to fret on the sidelines for the past four league games
as their once buoyant side failed to score in three of them, leaked 12
goals, and watched 11 vital points go down the drain.
As McVeigh said: ''If we even had taken half of those points, we would
been hard on the heels of Dundee. What we are producing is just not good
enough.''
The players have been told to prove that they are still hungry for
premier division football when they take on struggling St Mirren tonight
in a rearranged first division match at Broadwood, where they lost their
unbeaten home league record to St Johnstone on Saturday.
Changes will be made as Airdrie try to make up some of the nine points
they trail Dundee -- whom they next meet on Saturday at Dens Park.
''It's ridiculous,'' said McVeigh. ''Saturday's game now carries much
more importance than it should have done at this stage.''
Saints also are desperate for points as they fight to move clear of
Ayr United and Stranraer in the relegation zone. Victory tonight would
ease them five points clear of the bottom two, and take some of the
pressure off Jimmy Bone and his squad.
Clydebank, also struggling just above Saints, will be without the
injured Paul Agnew at Kilbowie as they face Hamilton, whose manager Iain
Munro probably will stick by most of the players who lost at Kirkcaldy
on Saturday, as he felt they played well. One enforced change will be
the need to replace defender Paul McKenzie, who is suspended.
In the second division Newcastle United are coming to the assistance
of promotion seeking Berwick, whose striker Paul Rutherford has knee
ligament damage. He will receive treatment from the English club.
Rutherford, however, remains doubtful for tonight against Queen of the
South.
Leaders Stenhousemuir restore John Clarke to their pool, but Max
Christie is suspended for the match against Meadowbank, who give late
checks to Tommy Graham, Craig Martin, and Doug Samuel.
Montrose could go back to the top of the third division tonight when
they visit Caledonian Thistle, who will draft in an ex-Premier League
striker in a bid to rekindle their flagging title challenge.
Manager Sergei Baltacha last night refused to name the player but
wants to field him as a trialist before considering a long-term deal.
Baltacha also wants a win to lift morale after the club denied weekend
newspaper allegations that they were suffering a cash crisis and that he
had been told to slash the first team pool.
East Stirling visit Alloa, who will be strengthened by the return of
defender Willie Newbigging.
* STEVE ARCHIBALD is poised to bridge a 16-year gap by signing Alex
Hamill for East Fife. Archibald was at Tottenham when Hamill, now 33,
joined the London club straight from school.
The Bayview manager said: ''We made an offer to Cowdenbeath last week
and they accepted it. owever, just before the signing they demanded
double the fee. I also offered Doug Barron in a player-swap, but this
was turned down.''
* BEITH Juniors manager Dennis Gray is the new manager of the Scotland
Junior international side.
That could signal a busier international programme with officials
looking towards European opposition in addition to the home countries.
The Scottish Junior FA announced yesterday that they have attracted
their first major sponsor, with Scottish Gas signing a two-year, #20,000
deal to back the international team and the inter-regional under
23-tournament.
Details were also given of a four nation tournament involving Eire,
Northern Irland, Isle of Man and Scotland which will be played in
Glasgow at the end of March.

DODDIE Weir is not the only member of his family whose international
position is under threat. His young brother, Tom, Gala's No.8, has been
left out of the national under-21 squad even though he played in all
four of Scotland's matches in that age group last season.
His omission has meant that he will not be included in the XV for the
under-21 international against Ireland at Myreside on Friday, February
3, a match in which the Scots will be trying to end a run of 15
successive defeats at that level. The team is expected to be named next
week, after the squad's work-out at Murrayfield on Sunday.
Weir the younger has suffered from an inauspicious under-21 trial on
Hogmanay. He was captain of the Blues beaten 45-22 by the Reds, and he
had the added disadvantage of playing out of position at wing forward.
David McLeish, the West of Scotland No.8, also has been omitted from
the Blues' back-row forwards. Only Tam McVie has survived from that trio
whereas all of the Reds' threesome -- Stuart Grimes, Dave Clark, and
Graham Dall -- have made it to the squad.
Grimes, who has come through via the Scottish Universities' team, was
not even an original selection for the trial, but he took his chance
with a notable performance both at the lineout tail and as blind-side
flanker.
Cameron Murray, the Hawick centre who played for Scotland's under-21
team last season, is in the squad even though he returned to rugby only
on Saturday after two months out because of a knee injury. His comeback
was in the Border League win over Kelso, a Mansfield Park match that
Derrick Grant, Scotland's under-21 team manager, watched.
Grant acknowledged that Murray was ''rusty'' after his lay-off. ''He
needs games,'' the manager added.
Even without Tom Weir, the squad includes eight players from last
season's under-21 team. Two of those, Chris Dalgleish, the Gala wing who
went on Scotland's tour to Argentina, and Hugh Gilmour, played also for
the national under-19 team last season, as did six of the under-21 squad
forwards. Squad:
Backs -- R N C Brown (Melrose), C S Dalgleish (Gala), B R Easson
(Boroughmuir), A Featherstone (Morgan Academy FP), P W B Flockhart
(Stewart's Melville FP), H R Gilmour (Heriot's FP), I S Leighton
(Melrose), M N McGrandles (Stirling), C Morley (Bath), J Morrison
(Currie), C A Murray (Hawick), M Rennie (Stewart's Melville FP).
Forwards -- G C Bulloch (West of Scotland), D G Clark (Stewart's
Melville FP), D Cunningham (Boroughmuir), G F Dall (Heriot's FP), I
Elliot (Hawick), L G A Graham (Boroughmuir), S Grimes (Edinburgh
University), P T Jennings (Boroughmuir), M H McCluskie, T A McVie (both
Edinburgh Academicals), D Massey (Currie), S Murray (Edinburgh
Academicals), G C Perrett (West of Scotland), B D Stewart (Edinburgh
Academicals).
* WELSH referee Clayton Thomas will control his first full rugby
international when he takes charge of the match between Scotland and
Canada at Murrayfield on January 21.
Thomas was a member of the international panel last season and will
have Robert Yeman and Robert Davies assisting him in the match. Davies
will referee the game at noon between Scotland Schools and New Zealand
Schools which precedes the full international.

ENGLAND have given the Scottish Basketball Association the go-ahead
for a full men's international at Meadowbank in the spring, but a date
and sponsor still have to be fixed up. The SBA have asked Edinburgh
District Council to consider staging the event to celebrate the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the opening of the centre but still await a
reply.
Scotland played England before a capacity 2500 crowd in a match to
mark the opening of Meadowbank in 1970 and a repeat seemed natural for
the Silver Jubilee but so far no events have been announced by EDC.
Scotland coach Allan Turner, who expects shortly to announce his men's
training squad for the season, is concerned to know as soon as possible
whether the match is a starter.
''I'm drawing up a programme of training and matches and would hate to
have to go ahead without it,'' he said.
Both Scotland and England are involved in European Championship
qualifying tournaments in May, Scotland in Geneva and England hosting
their own group in Birmingham from May 24 to 28, so both coaches would
welcome the match.
England already have started their preparations and were in Iceland
over the festive period, losing two matches out of three against the
Icelandic national squad whom Scotland will face in Geneva.
Hungary, Ireland, and the Netherlands are among the other countries
that England are lining up as warm-up opponents.
Turner hopes to have his first training sessions next month with
possibly a weekend get-together before the end of the season.
Livingston Bulls and Glasgow Brightsiders are sure to provide the
backbone of the team but one problem area is point guard and Turner
desperately needs some new blood to push through.
One candidate might be Brightsiders' Robert McKechnie, who is too old
for the Scottish team for the European Junior Championship qualifying
tournament (which Scotland will host in April at a venue still to be
confirmed).
Unfortunately, McKechnie pulled a calf muscle during a junior game
during the WICB tournament at Crystal Palace and missed all the senior
games when he would have had an ideal chance to show his paces.
But he had been in such fine form that he still is worth a look by
Turner, provided the injury has cleared up.
Bo'ness Wildcats' forward Lesley Russell staked a claim for
reconsideration for Lesley Beaton's Scottish women's squad when she
scored 37 points, a career-high, in her side's 97-63 win over
Boroughmuir Aces.
Capped at schools level when she was Lesley King, the Grangemouth High
School former pupil was dropped after Beaton's first training session.

THE Tartan Tour may be the biggest and best of its kind in Europe, but
it is still a dead end for golfers aspiring to win a passport to play
among the elite.
Neil Simpson, secretary of the Scottish Region of the PGA, yesterday
announced an expanded #700,000-plus programme for 1995 including six
72-hole events, but said afterwards the prospect of the winner of the
order of merit being awarded a European Tour card was not even under
discussion.
''I would love to see that happening,'' said Simpson, who pointed out
the the Scottish programme has no peer in Europe and is more extensive
even than Sweden, which is often held up as a role model for the
development of golf.
''But I doubt if the European Tour could be persuaded. They have
developed the Challenge Tour and the qualifying school for that purpose,
and we have to remember that our main role is to provide playing
opportunities for members.''
There are still a number of European perks. The Tartan Tour top two
are exempt into the final qualifying school at Montpellier, the top
three are given entry to the Volvo PGA Championship, the top nine have a
start in the Scottish Open, and the top three play in the European Team
championship, which Scotland have won three times in the last four
years.
The top players have shown they are eminently capable of making the
grade in Europe.
Last year's No.1, Kevin Stables, finished equal tenth in one of the
highest quality fields of the season in the PGA Championship at
Wentworth, but failed in the qualifying school at Montpellier.
Colin Gillies, the No.2 and leading money-winner with almost #25,000,
who played in all four rounds of last year's Open at Turnberry, did not
even go, unwilling to risk what he described as his life's savings.
Dean Robertson, the No.3, made it with nothing to spare, gaining the
second last card by chipping in for a birdie at the first hole of a
play-off.
This year the order of merit is to be sponsored by Ladbrokes in a
#13,000 deal, the winner receiving #3000.
There are two new counting tournaments this year, the Southern Open in
September at a venue to be announced, and a 72-holer at Downfield,
Dundee, in August, details of which are to be announced soon.
A third, the Scottish Matchplay championship, last played three years
ago when Ian Young was the winner, is also to return as an early-season
event, but the Gore-Tex Challenge, which was part of the Challenge Tour,
has been lost.

EVEN after a rare victory, the Scottish Schools have made four changes
for the match against their New Zealand counterparts at Murrayfield on
Saturday week.
Stuart Moffat, the Edinburgh Academy full back who led the B team
against the Australians at Balgray last month, will make his
international debut. So will Jamie Mayer, the Merchiston centre who also
played in that Glasgow match.
Charles Keenan, the Fettes boy who scored one of the three Scottish
tries in the 20-18 win over the Welsh at Goldenacre on Saturday, and
Mayer's Mechiston colleague, Chris Black, drop down to the replacements'
bench. Another Merchiston pupil, Simon Hannah, the Scots' captain, has
been switched from centre to scrum half in place of Black, and Danny
Mallinson, deposing Keenan, has been moved from full back to the left
wing.
Keenan will still have a game against the New Zealanders as he has
been chosen as full back in the Scottish Schools B team to meet the
tourists at Pennypit Park, Prestonpans, on Wednesday, January 25. Nine
boys remain from the B team whom the Australians beat 30-3.
Kick-offs will be 12.30 at Murrayfield (as that match is to be a
curtain-raiser to the Scotland v Canada international) and 2.15 at
Prestonpans. Teams:
Scottish Schools -- J S D Moffat (Edinburgh Academy); J M Craig (St
Aloysius), A J Bulloch (Hutchesons'), M J M Mayer (Merchiston), D R
Mallinson (Watson's); G Ross (Heriot's), S J Hannah (Merchiston),
captain; P J Fitzgerald (Dollar), M M Landale (Loretto), L R Walker
(Strathallan), J P R White (Cults Academy), A Barnes (Stewart's
Melville), A F Gladstone (Gordonstoun), A K Dall (Heriot's), N J M

(Gordonstoun), C H Black (Merchiston), M J Harvey (Peebles HS), D M S
Rutterford (Watson's), G E Hoyle (Stewart's Melville), R Anderson
(Duncanrig).

* TRAINER Lynda Ramsden and jockey Russ Garritty, called before the
Jockey Club disciplinary committee under the non-triers rule, were
cleared in London yesterday.
The Edinburgh stewards were of the opinion that the jockey had given
Top Cees an unduly easy ride when finishing third in December 19.
But yesterday's enquiry found that Top Cees had run on its merits. The
horse won on his next start seven days later at Wetherby.

GREAT Marquess is hard to oppose in the Nomad Novices' Hurdle today at
Leicester. The former Doncaster Cup winner was very impressive when
scoring on his hurdling debut over 19 furlongs at Hereford on Boxing
Day.
Indeed, that effort earned him a crack at the Grade 1 Challow Hurdle
over an extra quarter-of-a-mile at Newbury six days later.
He didn't look out of place at Newbury either, leading the field a
merry dance for a long way but fading in the straight and finishing very
tired in fourth behind Berude Not To.
This switch to two miles looks a shrewd move by trainer Nigel
Twiston-Davies, who will still hold justifiable hopes of making a
Cheltenham candidate of the horse.
Dual Image can make a winning start to his chasing career in the
two-mile Groby Novices' Chase.
Dual Image is one of the lesser lights in Jimmy FitzGerald's yard but
the eight-year-old has been in good heart over hurdles this term.
FitzGerald is sure to have schooled the gelding well for his
transition to the larger obstacles and the trainer looks to have found
him an ideal opportunity.
* RACING experts Martin Gale and White and Gold believed that
Woodland's Boy (9-1) was the best bet of the afternoon yesterday, and so
it proved, galloping away to win the three-mile chase at Lingfield by 11
lengths.

<HEADLINE>Paisley's best in Erskine's view. Author puts case for course high on the hill</HEADLINE>

WHICH golf course in Scotland has the best views? That's a question
sure to start a lively clubhouse discussion, writes Douglas Lowe.
Gleneagles might get a vote or two, and those who have played Loch
Lomond might think the vista across the loch from the sixth is hard to
beat. Clyde estuary courses are always in with a shout and Gourock or
Rothesay might stake a claim.
One that is unlikely to spring to many minds is Paisley, and before
you start chortling into your beer, let Robert Erskine, author of the
club's centenary book, put his case for the course perched high on the
Gleniffer Braes. He does not claim the course to be the best in this
respect -- even though it may be -- but cautiously says: ''We have a
view that few can rival.''
For starters in the lifting-your-head stakes, features of no fewer
than nine counties can be seen -- Renfrewshire, Ayrshire, Argyllshire,
Dunbartonshire, Stirlingshire, Perthshire, Fife, Lanarkshire, and
Midlothian.
He expounds thus: ''There is the immediate view of the valley with the
important landmarks of Paisley and district easily identifiable. Various
parts of Glasgow, including the University Tower, can be picked out
while, on a clear day, high-rise buildings in Dumbarton, Cumbernauld,
and East Kilbride can be seen, as can the TV masts at Blackhill and Kirk
O'Shotts.''
The author has been unable to verify one member's claim that the tops
of the Forth Bridges can be seen from the fifteenth tee, and if you are
thinking all of this is unattractively urban, there are a host of rural
delights as well.
He goes on: ''Further off, the views of the hills can be inspiring.
From most parts of the course there is a panorama starting in the west
with the Renfrewshire heights of Misty Law and the Hill of Stake. Coming
round by the Cowal Hills there is The Cobbler, Ben Ime, Ben Vorlich, Ben
Lui, Ben Lomond, the Kilpatricks, the Campsies, the Ochils, and the
Pentlands south of Edinburgh.
''From the highest parts of the course you can, in fact, see the
surface of Loch Lomond and, above the Kilpatricks, the tops of Ben More,
Ben Venu, Ben Vane, and Ben Ledi.
''Through the gap to the left of Dumgoyne at the western end of the
Campsies can sometimes be seen a dark, distant shadow which I understand
is the combined shape of Ben Vorlich at Lochearnhead and Ben Lawers at
Loch Tay.
''To complete the panorama, if you remember to look to the west as you
go up the first part of the fourth hole, you may see Goat Fell and the
other Arran hills while from the fifteenth tee, looking eastwards, the
west Lomond Hill in Fife and the pyramidal shape of Tinto Hill above
Lanark can be seen.''
Paisley would not have had this scenery if members had had their way
in the early 1950s when the town council compulsorily purchased the
course. The club is more commonly known as The Bushes because the course
until then was located down the hill on much less scenic land leased
from Bushes Farm and now occupied by Glenburn housing estate.
We wait with baited breath counter claims of better scenery, but in
the meantime, Paisley can also claim to be one of the most enlightened
clubs as far as women are concerned.
Women, from the outset, had equality with men and have retained the
right to vote at annual meetings, though they have rarely done so. One
such occasion, the book tells us, was in 1969 when the issue was . . .
removal of women's right to vote.
* HANDICAP cuts to all who spotted the following slip in last week's
article on stroke indices: ''If your handicap is equal to or less than
the stroke index you receive a stroke against the common enemy, par.''
The word ''less'' should, of course, have been ''more''.

Queen's Park 2, Morton 2
QUEEN'S Park earned a replay with a spirited two-goal second-half
fightback against their second division opponents.
Substitute Jamie Rodden grabbed the equaliser just two minutes from
time when he forced home a corner from the left which had been flicked
on by Graham Elder.
But Morton will be angry at having lost a two-goal lead and at an
amazing decision by referee George Clyde not to award them a penalty for
a blatant handling offence just nine minutes from time when Queen's
substitute Steve Campbell palmed the ball clear.
Morton began full of vigour and were two ahead within the first
half-hour.
With only six minutes gone, the second division side took the lead
when the Queen's defence stood still as a Derek McInnes corner reached
Rowan Alexander and the striker, unmarked, headed the ball into the net.
By then Morton were unlucky not to have already opened the scoring for
just before that attack an Alan Mahood shot beat keeper Jim Chalmers but
it was cleared off the line by Jim Orr.
Although the pacey Brian McPhee attempted to force Queen's back into
the game, it always looked likely that Morton would increase their lead.
And in 29 minutes they added a second when the Queen's defence again
was caught out. Scott McArthur knocked the ball on and defender John
Anderson, supporting his attack, rounded the keeper before slipping the
ball into the net.
Chalmers then blocked another Mahood drive before, early in the second
half, Graham Elder almost headed into his own net.
But in 58 minutes Queen's were given hope of saving the tie when Gary
Orr pulled a goal back with a low drive.

QUEEN'S PARK -- Chalmers, J Orr, Maxwell, Kerr, Elder, Graham, Callan,

AN ambitious fund-raising campaign, which includes a plan to sell
100,000 oak trees for planting across the north of Scotland in the next
few months -- for the benefit of Aberdeen University -- was unveiled
yesterday (writes Jeanne Gavin).
Mr Maitland Mackie, who graduated from Aberdeen with a BSc in
agriculture in 1958, is chairman of a fund-raising committee set up by
the university's agriculture faculty to support a #25m appeal to mark
the university's quincentenary.
Mr Mackie said that money raised from rural areas would be allocated
to specific projects, dedicated to rural development and the development
of a closer relationship between the university and its rural
hinterland. These would include grant support for students of
agriculture and rural economy.
The major fund-raising effort will be the sale, at a price of #5 each,
of five-year-old oak trees, donated by Mr Mackie from his own tree
nursery at Westertown, Rothienorman.
The first tree was sold by Mr Mackie yesterday to his father, Sir
Maitland Mackie, who is an Aberdeen Graduate of 1933.

AUSTRIA'S Thomas Muster's first experiment with a new style of tennis
play ended abruptly yesterday when he became the first seeded casualty
in the men's singles at the New South Wales Open.
The third-seeded Muster, a finalist in Sydney two years ago when he
lost to current world No.1 Pete Sampras, is keen to abandon his old
baseline game. But he suffered an early setback with a 6-2, 6-4 defeat
at the hands of Australia's Jamie Morgan.
Muster, ranked sixteenth in the world, is convinced he needs to adopt
a more flexible approach if he wants to break back into the top 10 and
insisted the result would not force a change of heart.
''I am coming to the net much more, taking the ball earlier, and not
staying so much on the baseline,'' said Muster, acknowledging the modern
game has forced him to change the tactics which once lifted him to sixth
position in the world.
Unfortunately for 27-year-old Muster, his younger opponent was in no
mood to lend assistance and took just 55 minutes to wrap up victory.
Morgan, ranked ninety-seventh in the world after a three-month absence
with a knee injury last year, served 10 aces as he joined fellow
countryman Michael Tebbutt, who beat America's Jared Palmer in three
sets, in the second round.
In the women's singles, Japan's Mana Endo set up a second-round
meeting with compatriot Kimiko Date, the defending champion, by beating
Australia's Kristine Radford 6-1, 6-1.
LEADING men's rankings as issued by the ATP Tour yesterday:
1, P Sampras (US) 5,097 pts. 2, A Agassi (US) 3,249. 3, B Becker

SCOTTISH dairy farmers could enjoy a long-term benefit from the
current system of regular auctions of milk supplies, although in the
first year it has produced a lower price to the producer than has been
achieved in England.
Mr John Ross, group purchasing manager with the Nestle group, said
yesterday that one reason the Galloway Creamery stood a chance of being
re-floated, was because there was a prospect of a more reasonable milk
price in Scotland. The resurrection of the Galloway plant would provide
another customer for Scottish milk, he said. In that context, it was
important to look at the longer term.
By contrast, the Milk Marque system adopted south of the Border was
much more of a one-off affair and, in his view, was in desperate need of
amendment.
The Milk Marque system had led to a price which had contributed to the
closure of several processing factories throughout the UK, and could
lead to the closure of several more, he said. ''I think it is too high,
and we need a better system to bring greater stability to the
industry.''
In the days of the milk marketing boards, said Mr Ross, there had been
little attempt to build up a relationship between producers and
processors, who were end-users of the product. ''For 60 years, we had
milk marketing boards and dairy trade federations. We had sides. We got
used to being in these trenches, and allowed the boards to run great
swathes of the industry. I now think we should not have allowed the
boards to do that. We should have had more involvement with the
industry. The boards ran their bit of the industry with remarkably
little inter-face with their customers.''
Farmers, too, would be expected in future to take more account of
their customers' views, Mr Ross told his audience at an international
dairy conference in Glasgow, run by Semex UK. The public were
increasingly concerned about ''green'' issues, and wanted to know about
housing conditions for animals, welfare, BST, and effluent disposal.
Most farmers, he said, would have little problem in that regard, because
the dairy industry already operated to high standards.
One possible area of conflict would arise if BST were licensed for use
as a means of increasing milk yields, he said. He would expect the 'Big
Five' supermarkets to say they would not have BST in their products.
''If they say that to us, we will have to find a way of satisfying that
requirement,'' he warned.
In one area, however, he disagreed with customer demand, as defined to
the conference by Mrs Teresa Wickham, director of corporate affairs for
Safeway Stores. Her market research colleagues had identified customer
demand for more taste to be ''bred'' into UHT long-life milk.
''I do not believe there is a future in special milks,'' said Mr Ross.
''I think that is a lot of hokum.'' The creation of special milks for
use as skimmed milk or UHT milk was too difficult to manage and control,
he said. ''It is too dangerous. If a market goes wrong, what do you do
with your special milk.''
For years, he had bought supplies of milk as ''wet white stuff'' from
the milk marketing boards, paying a price which took no account of the
composition of the product. Now, buying direct from producers, he could
pay a price based on a compositional quality basis -- but that pricing
did not apply to milk bought from the co-ops in Great Britain.

THE issue of animal welfare in Europe, which is threatening the export
trade in live animals from UK ports, should be taken out of the hands of
Agriculture Ministers and dealt with at head of State level, Mr Paul
Tyler, Liberal-Democrat spokesman on agriculture, said yesterday in
Glasgow.
''It is a big issue, which is putting at risk the whole single-market
structure -- and until that is realised we won't get progress,'' he
said.
He described the current situation on livestock transport as a fiasco
but, he added, some of the protestors here did not appreciate the true
situation. ''There are some who seem to believe you can have milk
without calves,'' he said.
''There are some who seem to have the curious idea that you can take
unilateral action in this country to affect something that happpens on
the other side of the Channel.''
If the activists thought the question through, they would realise that
they were actually encouraging precisely the problems they were seeking
to stop, he said.
If British producers who operated to the highest standards of animal
welfare were inhibited in their trade, opportunities were opened up for
those who did not uphold such standards, especially in Eastern Europe.
One result of blockades was that Britain would get a reputation as an
unreliable source of supply, he said. Anyone who thought that stopping
export on the hoof would increase export of carcases, was living in
cloud cuckoo land.
Aberdeen and Kincardine area executive of the National Farmers' Union
of Scotland have called for a greater effort to be made in explaining
the farmers' case to the public.
Mr Jim Arbuckle, Dunecht Farms manager, warned that if ''the mob'' was
allowed to win the current battle against exports, they would then turn
their attention to interfering with animal movements within the UK.
''We need our farming leaders to give out measure for measure
responses to the statements being made by the activists,'' he said.
''At the moment, only one side is winning -- their side. There must be
some way of counteracting the lobbying going on just now.''
Buchan farmer Jim Muir forecast that, unless action was taken now, the
kind of scenes currently taking place at ports and airports would be
re-enacted within 10 years outside local meat processing plants.

CITY of Glasgow Ragazzi have a superb record to maintain when they
return to business in the men's first division of the Royal Bank
Scottish Volleyball League at the weekend.
Ragazzi did not drop a set in the first half of the season, and resume
their programme in Aberdeen against the improved BA McGregor Glazing.
''We're looking at the match very closely,'' said coach Tommy Dowens,
''They beat Kilmarnock in the first half of the season. It's a tricky
fixture.''
However, three of his players -- Iain Grubb, Kenny Milne and Imonerfe
Bowes -- had little time to rest over the holiday period and, if
anything, should be even sharper after having travelled to Greece with
the Great Britain squad last month.
The trio attended Scotland training at the weekend, and Dowens, who
doubles as Scottish coach, believes the squad is a month ahead of
schedule in the preparations for the Spring Cup in May.
Meanwhile, Dundee, due to host the event for the first time, have
missed out on staging the British Universities Championships.
The organisers have decided that the tournament -- to be held on March
4-5 -- will be held at Strathclyde University instead, as they fear
teams coming from England would experience travel difficulties getting
back from Dundee.
At one stage, it looked as if the event would be moved to Leicester as
it was easier to get to for the English universities but at least the
event remains in Scotland.
''We're disappointed,'' admitted Dundee University's Paul McPate,
''And I was none too pleased when I heard that Leicester was being
considered. ''But the organisers made the point that if students are
travelling by train, then it can be difficult getting back south on a
Sunday night from Dundee.
''It would have been the first time that we hosted the event and I
suppose now it means that if it comes back to Scotland in future it
cannot be held at any university other than in Glasgow or Edinburgh.''

CALEDONIAN Media Communications will today become only the second
UK-based cable television operator quoted on the Stock Exchange after
the formal winding up of Worth Investment Trust was completed.
Shares in the Aberdeen-based company, formally known as Devanha, begin
trading at a placing price of 20[1/2]p though initial feeling within the
market indicates a speedy premium is likely and 26p is possible by the
end of the first day's trading.
Founded some 10 years ago, the company announced last month that it
would seek a full listing through the reverse takeover of Worth, a
moribund trust whose main attraction was its long-established quote on
the full market.
Devanha pioneered cable television in Scotland, operating the
broad-band franchises in its home city and Coventry as well as several
smaller narrow-band systems south of the Border.
Shares in Worth, managed by the Aberdeen-based Abtrust fund management
group, were suspended on the takeover announcement and yesterday's
extraordinary general meeting completed the transformation by approving
the change of status and name.
Worth's assets total just under #6m and their transfer to the new
group was a formality as the deal was already guaranteed by the 76%
level of irrevocable undertakings from the shareholders, a range of
small institutions.
The listing, which should value the company at more than #30m, is
sponsored by brokers Marshall Securities. Around #2.7m of the money
generated by the listing will be used to pay off debt.
''We are pretty confident that the issue will go well, given the
general sentiment towards the cable television sector and the reaction
to this listing in particular,'' Marshall's Andrew McDonald said
yesterday.
The huge TeleWest cable company was floated late last year with a
#1800m price tag and it was substantially over-suscribed.
''Obviously Caledonian is on a far smaller scale but there is no
reason why it will not be a success when the long-term profit potential
is taken into account,'' Mr McDonald added.
Caledonian has a subscriber base of 43,000 people and a turnover of
around #9.7m. It employs 135 people and made a profit of #255,000 in the
year to end-March. Investors include Legal &amp; General, Standard Life,
Scottish Value Trust and Aberdeen Trust.
Explaining the decision to float, executive chairman Graham Duncan
said it was a natural development for the company which was launched in
the early eighties as Aberdeen Cable Services.
Like other broad-band cables, it can carry more than 30 channels,
including BBC, ITV and a selection of satellite channels. There is also
scope for two-way communications, vital for the development of the
so-called information superhighway.
The narrow band operations, which are technically more limited, are
scattered across England in areas like Hull, the Wirral and Salford.
The flotation and new funds will allow Caledonian to proceed with
plans to upgrade existing networks in Aberdeen and Coventry and expand
its broad-band coverage to other parts of the country.

A BROKEN radiator cost Ari Vatanen the chance of a fifth title in the
Dakar rally yesterday when he was stranded in the desert and unable to
defend the lead he had held for almost a week.
Vatanen's Citroen broke down after 467 kms of the 504-km eighth leg
from Zouerat across the Mauretanian sands. He managed to buy water from
nomads, and got his car going, but it broke down again.
His Citroen team mate, Pierre Lartigue, last year's winner, gained the
overall lead after a tough day's driving during which winds whipped up a
sandstorm.
Lartigue leads by just more than 20 minutes from 1993 winner Bruno
Saby, driving a Mitsubishi.
Barring a double mishap, the two Frenchman are the only ones with a
realistic chance of winning the race which finishes in Dakar on Sunday.
Third-placed Kenjiro Shinozuka of Japan is more than two-and-a-half
hours behind in his Mitsubishi.
Spain's Jordi Arcarons retained the lead in the motorcycle section on
his Cagiva, but a thrilling finish can be expected with three-times
winner Stephane Peterhansel of France only seven minutes behind on a
Yamaha.Frenchman Thierry Magnaldi is well in contention on his Yamaha
and last year's winner, Cagiva rider Edi Orioli of Italy, is not
entirely out of sight. Leading standings:
Cars -- 1, Pierre Lartigue (France) Citroen, 33hr 35min 03sec; 2,
Bruno Saby (France) Mitsubishi, 20min 23sec behind; 3, Kenjiro Shinozuka

SIMON Engineering, which in September last year reported first-half
losses reduced from #52.6m to #12.4m and an improved debt position with
borrowings cut from #117.8m at the end of 1993 to #72.1m on June 30,
says that the improvement in trading and prospects has continued during
the second half of 1994.
Chief executive Dr Maurice Dixson reiterates that 1994 was regarded as
a period in which the major steps to return Simon to profitability were
identified and action taken. The company now ''looks forward with
confidence to 1995''.
It also announced, though, that further provisions of #5m on the UK
operations of the Access Division and discontinued operations will be
taken in the 1994 accounts. The shares weakened 7p to 79p.
The group's lenders have been briefed on current and projected
performance and have agreed to extend all facilities and to amend
Simon's covenants. However, interest charges have been raised and phased
repayments to US noteholders are commencing in June 1995 instead of July
1999.
The interest rate payable on the US loan notes is to increase by 1% to
10.32%. In return, Simon has negotiated an 18-month option within which
the loan notes can be paid down without penalty, providing greater
flexibility for the group in organising its future borrowing
requirements.
At today's interest rates this option would, if exercised in full,
eliminate the requirement to make a yield maintenance premium of some
$8m which would otherwise have been payable on early repayment. The
interest rates on the UK short-term facilities are being increased by
0.5%.
Each of the US operations of Access showed improving results and
strengthening order books. And the overall operations of Simon-Carves
have seen similar progress with a particularly strong recovery in
Australia. The market, however, is still adopting a cautious attitude at
this stage of the recovery programme.
* THE Royal Bank of Scotland, through its Citizens Financial Group
subsidiary in the US, has formally completed the #90m acquisition of the
Boston-based Quincy Savings Bank.
Announced six months ago, the deal has been approved by the US
regulatory authorities and Quincy stockholders.

The appointments are part of the strategy of turning Amstrad into a
holding company with subsidiaries in consumer electronics,
communications and personal computers.
Amstrad's chief executive, David Rogers, said: ''Today ACE accounts
for approximately 45% of Amstrad sales and these appointments are
therefore key to the rejuvenation of the group.
''Our other subsidiaries already have strong and proven managements in
place.''

<HEADLINE>Deutsche denies pushing MG to brink of bankruptcy</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Frankfurt, Monday -- The Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank,
yesterday fiercely denied that one of its board members had deliberately
pushed Metallgesellschaft into losses last year in a bid to wrest
control of the metals group.
The Deutsche statement came in response to an interview with
Metallgesellschaft's former management board chairman Heinz
Schimmelbusch, who was summarily dismissed from his post in December
1993 when huge losses were revealed at MG.
Mr Schimmelbusch alleged in an interview with news magazine Der
Spiegel that Deutsche's Ronaldo Schmitz, who is also head of MG's
supervisory board, had engineered the vast losses as a means to replace
the company's top managers.
''This allegation is grotesque and representative of the person who
made it,'' the Deutsche statement said.
The metals-to-environmental technology group slipped to the brink of
bankruptcy a year ago after running into billions of marks of losses on
risky oil deals in the United States.
The company was rescued from bankruptcy by Deutsche and other creditor
banks in a DM3400m deal.
Kajo Neukirchen, who took over as head of MG after Mr Schimmelbusch's
departure, recently announced a new set of capital plans under which the
company's capital will be halved and then subsequently increased.
These measures are due to be presented to shareholders at an ordinary
shareholder meeting on March 23.
In the interview, Mr Schimmelbusch said Mr Schmitz's original plan had
been to push out MG's former managers with reports of high losses and
then claim the glory when the old management's oil investments brought
windfall profits.
This plan had fallen apart when the price of oil continued to rise in
January last year, he added. This meant that oil could no longer be
bought in cheaply to service long-term supply agreements set up by MG.
Mr Schimmelbusch also alleged that Mr Schmitz had known about the oil
deals before December 1993 -- which Mr Schmitz denies.
He said Mr Schmitz knew the structure of the derivatives deals behind
MG's physical oil trading and also had the full information apparatus of
Deutsche Bank behind him and access to information from MG's auditors.
''He was always proud of the unofficial sources that he had in the
company with which he was keen to confront me,'' Mr Schimmelbusch told
Der Spiegel. ''It is a mystery to me how someone can say, given this
breadth of information, that he only learned of the oil trading on
December 3,'' he added.
The former MG manager also denied that these deals were purely
speculative. -- Reuter.

THE fall-out from last year's turmoil in international fixed interest
markets continued yesterday with S G Warburg announcing a restructuring
of its market activities, writes NICOLA REEVES.
In a surprise move it is pulling out of debt market-making in
currencies including the German mark, French franc and Japanese yen.
However, it will continue to be a gilt market-maker and issuer of
sterling bonds. The change of emphasis is expected to entail the loss of
180 jobs.
In common with an increasing number of banks Warburg has decided that
it can no longer afford to do everything profitably. It is to
concentrate its worldwide development on equity, equity-linked and
derivative activities, corporate finance and asset management. A more
compact and profitable fixed interest division will focus on gilts,
sterling bonds and US treasury bonds.
Warburg's estimates that the restructuring will result in annualised
savings of #25m. However, in the short term it will lead to a charge
being taken in the accounts which will depress this year's profits. In
the first six months of the current financial year the restructuring
will cut costs by #7m.
The restructuring, which has no impact on its 75%-owned subsidiary
Mercury Asset Management, comes just just weeks after merger talks
between Warburg and US investment bank Morgan Stanley, were terminated.
Despite the breakdown Warburg chairman Sir David Scholey believes the
group is ''as strongly placed'' as ever to continue its course of
building a leading global investment bank.

THE CRISIS at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi deepened yesterday as three of its top
executives quit, in the wake of the angry departure of Maurice Saatchi.
Jeremy Sinclair, acting chairman, David Kershaw, chairman and chief
executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising UK, and Bill Muirhead, chief
executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America, have all departed, leaving
a huge vacuum at the top of the group.
Saatchi shares plunged 16p to 124p after the announcement and are
likely to fall further on fears that the whole group is unravelling.
In their resignation letters, the three men echoed Maurice Saatchi's
attack on the shareholders who forced him to leave, indicating they did
not understand the business.
Mr Saatchi's departure has prompted unease among clients and two
leading ones, British Airways and Mars, said they were reviewing their
accounts. This further loss can only increase this uncertainty.
Observers said Mr Sinclair was the creative genius behind many of the
agency's most famous campaigns and his decision to go was thought
certain to have an effect on the agency's key creative departments. Mr
Muirhead was in the process of sorting out the American side of the
group.
The resignations prompted speculation in the advertising world that
the three will join Maurice Saatchi and found a rival agency, taking
important clients and creative personnel with them. This is the classic
risk of ''people'' businesses. Their key assets can literally walk out
the door.
Normally in these circumstances the financial package for a sacked
executive will include a provision that he should not re-enter the
business on his own account for several years. The package for Maurice
Saatchi is currently being negotiated but he is unlikely to agree to
such a clause.

BT is expected to announce this morning that it is to move into the
German telecommunications market through a link-up with Viag AG, ahead
of the European Union's liberalisation of the market in 1998.
This will give it a foothold in Germany from which it will be ready to
compete with state-owned Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecoms
carrier, soon to be privatised.
BT had wanted to go into partnership with Telekom but the German
company chose instead to form an alliance with France Telecom.
In 1993, BT forged an alliance with MCI, the second-largest US
long-distance carrier, resulting in the Concert $1000m joint venture
between the two companies which provides network services to big
corporate users.
Initial consortium moves in Europe are likely to be based on Concert
but BT's aim will be to be a leading player when the German market opens
up and it will be able to apply for a national operator's licence.
Both BT and Viag have scheduled news conferences for this morning
though neither company has commented on speculation that there was to be
a deal between them.
Analysts were taking a positive view in that it would boost BT's
international expansion and transform Viag into a powerful force in the
German telecoms market.
Viag, which has been seen as an also-ran in the market, would get
needed know-how and access to overseas markets while BT would gain entry
to the German market with the added benefit of a gateway to eastern
Europe.
Aside from any tie-up between BT and Viag, there are several major
groups lining up to vie for a share of the German communications market
when it is opened for competition.
There is the Deutsche Telekom/France Telecom partnership, while
utilities RWE and Veba are forming their own groups.

GRAND Metropolitan is hoping to repeat the success it has had with
Haagen-Dazs, the ice-cream in the sexy advertisments, with Old El Paso,
a brand covering Mexican foods.
This is the basic rationale behind its proposed #1700m purchase of an
American foods company, Pet, which incidentally has nothing to do with
petfoods, a market GrandMet pulled out of recently.
For GrandMet chief executive George Bull the deal is a major step
towards his goal of becoming a world leader in food, raising the group's
position in the US food league table to number seven, ahead of such
well-known names as Heinz, Kellogg and PepsiCo and behind the likes of
Nabisco and Sara Lee.
Old El Paso is the prize as it is US market leader in Mexican food,
which is steadily growing in popularity, helped by the growing Hispanic
population and increasing numbers of Mexican restaurants. In recent
years the market has been growing by some 10% a year.
Paul Walsh, the Mancunian who runs Pillsbury, said they wanted to see
bottles of salsa sauce alongside the ubiquitous ketchup in all American
diners.
Other countries are way behind the US but are also expanding
consumption rapidly from a very low base. In the UK it is now some #31m
a year.
Pet's other main brand, Progresso, is mainly in soups and Italian
sauces, also said to be growth markets, while the rest of the portfolio
ranges from Aunt Fanny's bakery products to Downyflake frozen waffles.
Progresso also includes a vegetable canning business, an area where
GrandMet has been pulling out of.
Half Pet's sales are generated by market-leading or second-place
products but this still leaves a number of secondary brands not fitting
in with the group's aim of having a narrow range of ''megabrands''
occupying first or second place in their markets -- those in third place
or lower face the brunt of competition from own-label.
This leaves room for disposals as GrandMet did after the Pillsbury
purchase five years ago.
GrandMet certainly presents a strong case for the purchase, saying
that there will be economies to be made out of integrating distribution,
marketing and other functions of Pet and Pillsbury, in addition to the
strong market positions of Pet's main brands.
But GrandMet shares still plunged 26[1/2]p to 378p, though the fall
was exaggerated by them going ex-dividend. Such a fall shows the
market's initial wariness about the deal.
Pillsbury was criticised at the time for its price and it has taken
several years to get right. In fact, only now has the management got
time on its hands to expand the business with a major purchase.
Restructuring write-offs are becoming a feature of Grand Met's results
and this is set to continue with #120m set aside to cover Pet's
integration costs.
Haagen-Dazs's international success has only been achieved through
prodigious marketing spending. Pillsbury already spends $600m a year on
promoting its three key brands -- Green Giant frozen vegetables,
Pillsbury dough products and Haagen-Dazs.
Old El Paso is in more of a niche market but will inevitably require
heavy spending to keep sales growing rapidly. GrandMet talks of
extending Progresso into new products but this again could only be done
with a heavy marketing budget.
Financially, the all-cash deal will raise gearing to 100%, though
finance director Gerald Corbett pointed out yesterday it was more
meaningful to take net debt as a percentage of capitalisation, which
works out at 40%, and the credit rating agencies seem to agree with him.
The capitalisation can be said to reflect the value the market places
on GrandMet's brands.
Pet is a quoted company and its board is recommending acceptance of
the offer which represents a 50% premium to the pre-bid share price.
There are bound to be fears that GrandMet is paying too much. However,
the price is not out of line relative to the purchase Campbell Soup made
last year for a leading producer of Mexican sauces, and the purchase
will contribute to earnings in the first year, excluding restructuring
costs.
On balance, GrandMet deserves the benefit of the doubt over Pet which
looks a valuable addition to its brands, assuming, of course, that the
bid is not trumped by another multinational.
The purchase will increase the foods' proportion of group sales to 61%
from 56% and of profits to 55% from 49%. The balance is, of course, the
drinks activities.

<HEADLINE>Hot summer helps A G Barrlift profit 63% to record level</HEADLINE>

A LONG hot summer for A G Barr, which boosted sales of brands such as
Irn Bru and Tizer, helped the Glasgow-based soft drinks company increase
annual pre-tax profits by 63% to a record level.
Barr raised its total dividend by 20% to 7.8p, after a proposed final
dividend of 5.8p. The shares gained 11p to 386p to give a yield of 2.5%.
Turnover, down 4.5% in the first-half, had recovered the previous
year's level by the year-end, with UK sales of Barr labels up nearly 5%
on the previous financial year.
Barr posted pre-tax profits of #6.65m for the year to end-October,
after #4.07m last time and a previous best of #5.97m in 1992. The market
had been expecting a figure of only #5m. Turnover of #87.96m was
virtually unchanged.
The higher margins achieved through sales of Barr label brands,
compared with retailers' own-label brands which carry little or no
mark-up, were largely responsible for the significant increase in
profitability.
Chairman Robin Barr said: ''Trading during the second half of the
current year was considerably assisted by the excellent summer
weather.''
On the downside, the company warns that the drop in sales of its
retailers' own-label brands, which face fierce price competition, has
not yet levelled off. Barr has had to compete with the high-profile
arrival of American-style colas on supermarket shelves.
Meanwhile, the plastic used to make many of its bottles costs a
quarter more than it did a year ago. There has also been a 15% rise in
the cost of cardboard.
Barr will take over the Orangina franchise for the UK take-home trade
in March, which will help the company continue to fight competition from
recently launched brands like Virgin Cola.
Mr Barr said: ''In such a competitive and uncertain market place, our
brands will continue to be supported by a high level of marketing
expenditure and we are confident that this, coupled with the addition of
Orangina to our portfolio from March 1995, will make us an even more
effective competitor in the soft drinks market place.''
The impact of Barr's takeover of the Orangina franchise is likely, he
acknowledges, to have a somewhat muted effect on profitability this
year. However, Mr Barr added: ''Clearly we see it as an excellent
addition to our portfolio in years ahead.''
He declined to forecast next year's result, explaining: ''The only
basis of making an accurate forecast is to know the weather that will be
received by the British Isles during May, June, July, and August 1995.''
Last summer saw the south of England in particular basking in sunshine
for more than two months from the end of June. While acknowledging last
year's weather was better than average, Mr Barr said: ''It wasn't a 1976
so it could be better next year -- who knows.''
Richard Andrews, analyst at Edinburgh-based stockbroker Bell Lawrie
White, said: ''They were very good results. They far outstripped all the
forecasts that were in the market.'' He has pencilled in forecasts of
#6.7m and #7.4m for the current and following financial years.
The shares are selling at nearly 16 times earnings per share, up 56%
to 24.17p.

THE economic data on the UK economy has arguably never been so good
and yet there is still a lack of the so-called ''feel-good'' factor.
However, this may all be about to change at least in the corporate
sector, according to a UK Corporate Health Check published by CCN, the
financial information company best known for its credit reference
activities.
The report suggests that ''the recovery will get a second wind'', as
companies that have fuelled growth so far through internally generated
funds or trade credit may have no option but to go outside for funds.
CCN, part of Great Universal Stores, is the UK's leading credit
information company and has a large database on UK companies. Throughout
the recession and subsequent economic recovery it has been able to chart
the progress of UK companies both geographically and via activity.
Looking back over the last 10 years the peak profitabilty for UK
companies was in 1988-89, the height of the consumer boom. Profitability
is now back to what is seen as the more sustainable levels of the
early-mid 1980s. However, financial debt is still historically high
which is undoutedly acting as a brake on confidence.
The apparent upward path of UK rates is a cause for concern among
companies coming as it does at a time of low inflation, thereby
increasing the real -- after taking into account of inflation -- debt
burden.
Geographically, Scottish-registered companies appear to fare the worst
of any in the UK but the raw CCN data disguises the fact that the
Scottish economy did not slump into the depths of recession seen
elsewhere in the UK in areas such as South-east England, East Anglia and
the West Midlands.
On the whole, while profitability of Scottish companies has stood up
well during the recession, the CCN report suggests that it is still well
below the average for British-registered companies as a whole. In
contrast to other parts of the UK there was a downturn in Scottish
corporate profitability during 1994, with the return on capital falling
to 6.6%.
The CCN report notes that debt financing as a proportion of assets
(based on borrowing ratio) has been on a strong upward trend in Scotland
for the past decade and rose to a high level of over 80% in 1994. This
contrasts sharply with a national average of under 55% and is the
highest of all parts of the UK.
Without wishing to sound alarmist the report adds that this sharp rise
in debt financing has been accompanied by a correspondingly sharp fall
in interest cover. It suggests this raises concern about the financial
risk facing many of the companies involved.
Within Scottish corporations the intensity of asset utilisation has
improved slightly since the low point of 1980, but on the whole has
tended to fluctuate within a range of between 1.2 and 2.2 and currently
stands below the average for the UK as a whole.
CCN notes that the most favourable feature of performance for those
companies registered in Scotland has been a strong and consistent
improvement in the average number of days taken before customers
settled. In 1984, the average number of credit-period days stood at over
60, while in 1994 the figure was less than half -- falling to below the
national average of about 36 days.
On a sectoral basis, the pharmaceutical industry stands out as the
most consistent performer, maintaining a generally rising trend in
profitability over the last decade.
The most remarkable turnaround in margins is in the engineering
industry, which saw margins rise from an all-time low of 0.31% to 2.23%
in 1994, still well below the industrial average, but an improvement on
the previous two years.
The CCN Corporate Health Check, which is to be published quarterly, is
compiled from the financial statements of the UK's top 1000 companies by
turnover, so that includes a number of private companies such as
Littlewoods.

The late Rudolf Nureyev's household comes under the hammer: D'Este
Bond puts a price on his favourite things
The price of fame
RUDOLF Nureyev, born into great poverty on a train in Siberia in 1938,
rose to spectacular international fame and wealth as perhaps the
greatest dancer in the world, and led a life as dramatic as any of the
100 roles he matered, and ultimately as tragic.
He died on January 6,1993, of Aids. Since he defected to the West in
1961, we have seen and read about his wildfire performances, his
ecstatic fans (89 curtain calls with Fonteyn in Vienna in 1964 -- still
a record), his ''luminous imagination'' as a dancer, choreographer,
director, even conductor.
We read of his inexhaustible partying, theatre-going, travelling,
tantrums, terror of kidnappers and of flying, and his insatiable
love-life, in a racy new *biography.
Now, on Thursday and Friday, in New York, Christie's present Nureyev
in another role, ''Nureyev, the self-educated connoisseur-collector'',
they call him, ''a private man with a thirst for knowledge.''
He had ''additional homes'' in the South of France, London, Virginia,
the Caribbean and a ''group of islands off the Amalfi coast'', but
Nureyev's two main bases were in Paris and New York. A disagreement
leaves the Paris flat ''sealed'', and Christie's sale includes only
property from his New York apartment, with some from Virginia and
London.
We are told the rooms in the apartment ''resemble the great halls of
palaces of another age.'' Their contents amount to 507 lots, and are
expected to net $3m to $4.5m.
The rich and famous notoriously make ''collections'' for investment,
advised by a bevy of decorators and dealers who impose a sort of elegant
taste without individuality. But Nureyev's choice of paintings and works
of art was, emphatically ''his eye, his taste, his choices -- he had a
distinct and distinguished eye,'' says Andrea Fluczynski, one of
Christie's experts on the sale. He is said to have done his
window-shopping late at night, after performances (when he could not
sleep).
Ballet costumes provide 112 lots -- jackets in satin, velvet,
embroidered braided and bejewelled, blouses, hats, turbans, ballet
slippers, and a ballerina's costume for Swan Lake, given to Nureyev by
Fonteyn.
He is photographed wearing a Chinese Imperial dragon robe, and
doubtless he also dressed up in the eighteenth-century embroidered
waistcoat ($300 to $500), the Afghan Turkman robe ($300 to $400),
perhaps even the Japanese priests' robes ($600 to $900) or the Russian
Orthodox robe of crimson silk brocade ($800 to $1200).
Predictably, there are also 94 kilims and textiles, including the
many-coloured rugs of Turkey, Afghanistan, and the Caucasus, now
fashionable, but for Nureyev part of his Tartar heritage.
From his bedroom, papered with heavy bunches of multicoloured fruit,
Nureyev could catch a glimpse of two dramatic male nudes in the salon, a
powerful Roman marble male torso ($300,000 to $500,000), in the centre
of the room, at eye-level, and behind it a wilting, slightly effeminate
nude Youth, being defended against Love (nude female, ironically) the
the goddess of Wisdom -- a flamboyantly ''romantic'' painting by Charles
Meynier ($120,000 to $180,000).
Inside the salon, one is overpowered by a bounty of massive male
nudes, including Poseidon seated on a Throne, coyly crossing his legs,
and two dramatic scenes of multiple nudes in the Garden of Eden,
including Fuseli's naked ''Satan Starting from the Touch of Ithuriel's
Lance'' ($500,000 to$700,000), and a dramatic group of naked Scythians,
a lion and a wild horse, by J-F Ducq ($50,000 to $70,000).
In the midst of this turmoil of human and animal flesh stood a
supremely elegant, arrogant figure, fully clothed in breeches and
scarlet coat, Lord de Farrars painted by Reynolds -- a witty
juxtaposition.
In ''the bedroom'' the mood was oddly demure, if equally sumpuous. A
seventeenth-century Dutch portrait of a serious young lady with
frivolous red bows livening up her puritan outfit ($25,000 to $35,000)
hangs beside the great Elizabethan oak tester bed ($15,000 to $20,000).
Two sets of three medieval female saints with long golden hair and,
dressed in flowing fabrics that have a balletic movement of their own,
look down (Rhenish School, circa 1500, $150,000 to $250,000).
The bedroom also housed a beautiful eighteenth-century harpsicord by
Kirckman ($100,000 to $120,000). An 1820s combined chamber organ and
barrel organ $25,000 to $35,000) a Chinese moon guitar and a Korean drum
($300 to $500 each) were among Nureyev's collection of musical
instruments -- he always travelled with a ghetto-blaster -- used for
classical music only.
Entirely papered with Chinese wallpaper panels ($20,000 to $30,000)
the dining room had a vast Venetian rococo-style Murano-coloured glass
chandelier with 55 lights ($25,000 to $35,000) hanging over the simple
table and 12 chairs.
The whole collection has a powerful, passionate presence -- almost as
dramatic as Nureyev's dancing. But perhaps the piece de resistance is
the bath-tub, Victorian copper, ''of oblong form with arched ends, with
nozzle and drain'' $3000 to$4000).
Who will buy? For the Old Master paintings, the furniture (elegant
Russian birch and heavy English oak), the sculpture, maps, prints --
theatrical, comic, architectural views of Paris and Vienna, and the few
Russian icons, ''the Nureyev factor won't make a vast difference,'' says
Ms Fluczynski.
But for the ballet slippers, the costumes, and some of Nureyev's own
modern clothes, hats and shirts, there will be ''the Nureyev groupies''
and the estimates could be far outstripped. ''Goodness -- who knows?''
she says. The proceeds of the sale will go to two Nureyev charitable
foundations for dance and medicine.

Drugs are just as readily available at the village disco as they are
in the urban jungle, as Andy Murray discovers
HARD DRUGS have become so common in city housing schemes that their
news value is diminishing; now, however, there is growing evidence that
the problem has spread to the rural hinterlands of Scotland.
Drugs of every illicit kind are now just as available at village
discos as they are in the urban jungle, according to Scottish Drugs
Forum (SDF), which recently, in conjunction with Dumfries and Galloway
Health Board, organised a national conference on the rural drugs scene.
The rural idyll is no more; take Dr Charles Lind's warning: ''Just
because there are green fields and a few sheep does not protect people
against despair and economic deprivation.''
Lind, a consultant psychiatrist with Ayrshire and Arran Health Board,
paints a depressing but realistic picture of drug use in rural Scotland.
''Like most other areas of rural Scotland Ayrshire is moving away from
the idea that everything is bliss. There is just as much dysfunction as
anywhere else.
''Cumnock and Doon Valley has extraordinarily high levels of drug use
-- in small decaying mining towns with no infrastructure.
''At the moment I have a far longer waiting list than I find
acceptable. Ecstasy, heroin, temgesic and temazepam are widespread.''
Lind puts the number of intravenous drug-users in Ayrshire at 1500 and
there are between 250 and 300 people at any one time on substitute
treatment such as methadone.
''There is a confidentiality problem in small villages. What do you do
for alternative prescriptions when a user's aunt's neighbour works in
the local chemist shop?''
According to the SDF, sections of the media have created myths about
drug-users which frighten people and deter users from coming forward for
help.
''It is hard to argue for a service in rural areas because drugs are
not perceived as a problem. It is really only when a service is set up
that you identify a need, but you cannot identify a need very easily
without the service. It's Catch-22,'' comments David Liddell, director
of the SDF.
''There are pockets of problem drug-users throughout rural Scotland. A
recent survey pinpointed a problem with injectors in East Lothian, for
instance.''
Information on drug use is difficult to obtain because of the
traditionally conservative thinking in rural areas; the unwillingness of
people to broadcast their worries; because of differences in policing
methods; and because of the appearance of new drugs such as ecstasy. The
distinction between soft and hard drugs, moreover, is often blurred.
A recent survey of 15 to 16-year-olds in the Highlands found 48% had
tried at least one drug. One in 10 had used LSD, 8% had used
amphetamines, 5% had used ecstasy, and 4% had tried tranquillisers. But
statistical evidence is marred when parents sometimes accuse their
children of gilding the lily, as Mr Brian Gardner, drugs adviser for
Highland Health Board, told the conference.
''Even when significant use of drugs is identified in a rural area
like Highland, denial and aversion can often result,'' he said.
''For example, some parents participating in a survey being conducted
by Strathclyde University into knowledge of, and attitudes to, drug
education have claimed that 15 to 16-year-olds involved in the lifestyle
survey were simply exaggerating their involvement in sexual activity,
drug, and alcohol use.
''It would appear that drug-taking, a normally covert activity, is
even more hidden from the general population in a predominantly rural
location.''
A survey of adult drug-users conducted by Highland Health Board's
mental health unit in 1992 showed that all 106 respondents had used
cannabis or alcohol at one time, and over 90% had used LSD, magic
mushrooms, and amphetamines.
Tranquillisers and analgesics had been used by 75%; cocaine by 58%;
glues and solvents by 56%; sedatives, diconal, heroin and methadone by
30% to 40%, and crack by 6%.
Fifty per cent had injected drugs; over 90% had used between five and
12 different drugs.
A pilot scheme for drug-users has been run in Banff and Buchan
district since March. Mr George Harvey, a spokesman, thinks the problem
of rural drug use is anything but recent, and he says the mobility of
the population may have contributed to the problem.
''There is a certain binge-culture around here, mainly in drink, but
with drugs also. There was a tradition that people spent a lot of time
offshore and then came back to get out of their heads for a weekend.
Problems build up.''
In the south the resources of the Borders drug and alcohol resource
team based at Dingleton Hospital, Melrose, are increasingly stretched.
''Over the past couple of years the caseload has increased quite
rapidly,'' said Julie Murray, a community nurse. ''We now have 60 people
who have drug-related health problems. That, of course, is just the tip
of the iceberg. There are a lot of people out there we are not seeing.
''Speed is probably our biggest problem, and valium and temazepam,
too. It is not confined to the big towns of Hawick and Galashiels; it's
in the villages as well.''
In neighbouring Dumfries and Galloway the drug problem is worse.
Government statistics show that 21 drug addicts were notified to the
Home Office during 1992. In the year ending March 31, 1993, as many as
34 new patients joined the queue in the region for treatment for
conditions caused by drug misuse. Seventeen of these were injectors.
During the following financial year there were 214 new referrals to
the health board service for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug
misusers.
Between January, 1993, and April, 1994, over 30 intravenous drug-users
took advantage of a needle exchange scheme in Stranraer alone. Doctors
in the region support a voluntary bar on temgesic.
Dr John Waterhouse, the consultant psychiatrist at the drug and
alcohol problems unit, said there had never been a time when so many
drugs were so easily available in the towns and the villages.
''Some housing schemes in Dumfries look like those in Glasgow and have
the same problems, but the level of service is inevitably much less,''
he said.
''There has been a correlation in the 1980s between deprivation such
as unemployment and drug-taking, whereas the 1960s expansion was more or
less a middle-class thing.''

DEDICATIONS from Nanci Griffith. Duets with Iris DeMent. Tom Paxton is
in danger of becoming hip again. The man whose songs moved a whole
battalion of beginner guitarists off the bottom rung, and whose
trademark bonnet became a fashion accessory in the 1960s, says
Griffith's assertion that ''we're all born knowing Tom Paxton songs''
makes him feel like Old Father Time.
''But it's a very kind thing to say also,'' he adds with obvious
pride. Griffith recorded Paxton's Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound
on her Other Voices, Other Rooms album. Evergreen, along with Last Thing
On My Mind and a dozen others, it kept Paxton's words on many a folk
club audience's lips for years.
''I never knew, of course, when I was writing these songs that they
would assume the status they have,'' he says. ''They're not big hits,
but they're in the fabric and that's what I was trying to do. I was just
learning to play when I wrote them so I suppose it's appropriate that
they suit beginner guitarists -- mind you, I've never really got much
past that stage myself!''
Paxton has the US Army to thank for his arrival from Bristow (40 miles
south-west of Tulsa), Oklahoma on the early 1960s New York folk scene
with, he says, impeccable timing. Posted within commuting distance of
Greenwich Village, he would spend weekends doing the rounds of the
coffee bars and sleeping on a friend's sofa. When he left the army he
stayed on in the Big Apple and learned his craft first-hand from Pete
Seeger, Woody Guthrie, and Leadbelly among others.
''It was the time to arrive in New York with a guitar and a desire to
sing folk songs,'' he says. ''We heard Mississippi John Hurt three or
four times a night for several weeks. He would be on the same bill and
as we didn't have to leave between shows we could sit there and listen
-- and we did.''
The first songs Paxton learned had been gleaned from the repertoire of
bear-like Burl Ives. When he began writing his own he took as his model
The Weavers' mid-1950s classic Live at Carnegie Hall album.
''You hear all sorts of songs on that record: lullabies, Spanish Civil
War songs, you name it. The breadth is fabulous and that had a huge
effect on me. You don't have to limit yourself. You can write songs
about anything and you don't have to be commercial. They might never
earn you a dime -- although God knows, it's lovely to get some
royalties.''
The list of people who have recorded Paxton songs is all but endless.
Sometimes he earned those royalties without the record buyers realising
he'd written the song, a case in point being the daft, almost throwaway
Bottle of Wine, a 1968 US smash hit for Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs.
At his producer's suggestion it's there on Paxton's latest album,
Wearing the Time, alongside songs covering a typically varied range of
topics from romance to the stupidity of America's gun laws to growing
old.
''I also have a humorous song in my show about this magazine that's
sent to the membership of the American Association of Retired Persons,
which is just asking for it, I suppose. But I feel comfortable writing
songs like Wearing the Time and it's natural for me to be writing love
songs from this perspective. There would be nothing sillier than for me
to try and convince people I was 27 instead of 57. It's important to
reflect who you really are in your writing.''
Before he wrote and recorded the album, Paxton went through a period
of depression, which he is reluctant to discuss beyond confirming that
writer's block was a by-product. He is, however, now ''writing like a
fool'' and craving a rerun with Iris DeMent -- in person this time. Her
contribution to their duet, Along the Verdigris, was actually recorded
as a surprise.
''When I wrote the song I kept hearing Iris singing it. I told my
producer, Jim Rooney who also produces Iris, and he sneaked her in then
said, 'I've got something for you.' It wasn't my birthday but it might
as well have been. She's wonderful. I'd cross the country to sing with
her any time she likes.''
Tom Paxton plays Glasgow Royal Concert Hall's Strathclyde Suite
tonight and tomorrow as part of the Celtic Connections series.

A STRANGE particle of theatre history appeared in Edinburgh at the
weekend -- Portal Productions' staging of Rudolf Steiner's fourth, and
last, mystery play, The Soul's Awakening.
Though Steiner is primarily associated with the fields of education,
agriculture, architecture and medicine, his activities were underpinned
by a real awareness of the value art and imagination have in daily life.
Written for a series of drama festivals, held in Munich between 1910
and 1913, these four plays were meant as an artistic expression of
Steiner's research into the evolution of human consciousness, the nature
of our inner, spiritual self and our connection with the wider cosmos.
In form, as well as in content, they reflected his theories on colour,
harmony, movement, and sound -- embodied in the art form he conceived as
Eurythmy.
Taken together as a cycle the plays charted the interconnecting paths
of seven people seeking out spiritual development, a journey spanning
several centuries and various locations within different worlds. In The
Soul's Awakening, scenes shift from the apparent present-day to ancient
Egypt, from a mountain landscape to the spiritual plane, so that we can
see how the characters have been shaped by the experiences of past
incarnations (a central element of Steiner's philosophy).
For students and practitioners of his teaching this may be a highly
charged, profoundly affecting event. For the rest of us, what did the
seven and a half hours offer? At best, some exquisite stage pictures
richly textured with orchestrated lighting, movement and music. And a
poignant sense of Steiner's yearning to make philosophical debate into a
vital, energised artistic form.
The piece is thick with words, sometimes too many for a casual
listener to digest, but Portal Productions' cast did well to make us
aware of the sonorities, the cadences of the text, just as their entire
staging did much to bring alive the elements of gesture, line, form and
colour.
A vastly curious experience, one which felt like looking through the
veils of time, back to an age when theatre was perhaps the unchallenged
art form for communicating ideas.

Mayfest's new artistic director Paul Bassett breaks with tradition and
spills the beans early. He tells Sara Villiers of his guaranteed
crowd-pullers
THE thumbscrews are hidden in my bag as I walk into the Mayfest
offices in Glasgow's Albion Street and greet Paul Bassett, the new
artistic director of the festival. As he disappears to fetch me a coffee
I look wildly around the meeting room for a socket to plug in my Gestapo
lamp.
But, against all expectations, intimidation tactics are not necessary
to extract a sneak preview of Mayfest '95. Bassett is happy to reveal
some highlights, without any psychological pressure from my one-woman
press corps.
A noticeboard in the corner of the room lists the criteria deemed
important for the festival's '95 brochure and unusually,
cloak-and-dagger secrecy is not one of the requirements. The brochure is
not due out until March, and traditionally, the programme is kept secret
until then but Bassett is adopting a different approach. Rather than
overwhelming the press with one massed batch of information he hopes to
dispense highlights gradually.
The Citizens' exclusively revealed their spring programme to The
Herald two weeks ago, including their Mayfest shows, and Bassett is
happy such information is released as, and when, shows are confirmed.
Today he's letting two cats out of the bag, with news of a Scottish
premiere for Robert Lepage's Needles and Opium and a return visit of the
Tron's '94 Mayfest hit Dumbstruck, starring Elaine C Smith.
The two shows, which will both play at the Kings Theatre, perfectly
encapsulate Bassett's definition of Mayfest as ''a festival which
combines a core of theatre from Glasgow with extraordinary works from
around the world.''
Bristling with excitement about the Lepage show, which he caught in
Berlin in the autumn, he is also enthusiastic about Dumbstruck's second
outing. ''I would absolutely equate the two in terms of quality,'' he
says. ''Dumbstruck boasts excellent Scottish acting, and having Elaine C
Smith as a lead is going to be an obvious crowd-puller.''
David Kane's black comedy, set in a Glasgow theatrical lodging house
in the sixties, was a sell-out success last year and will no doubt prove
a sound financial choice. It will be dropping into the Kings after a
tour which includes Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling, Edinburgh and Newcastle
and afterwards will be heading down to London, with the capital's
critics already predicting a huge hit.
Smith takes over the role previously played by Eileen MacCallum, who
has other commitments, but otherwise the production boasts the original
cast, including Jimmy Chisholm, Forbes Masson, Robert Paterson and Bob
Carr, although the latter pair are swopping roles.
Dumbstruck's calibre justifies its high-profile inclusion for a second
year running, especially in light of the national debate about the lack
of second productions for new work which flared up last year, while
Bassett is practically dumbstruck in his wonderment over Lepage's
Needles and Opium, summing up his opinion with the concise, explanatory
''wow!''
A one-man show, in which Lepage himself originally performed, Needles
and Opium is a hallucinogenic-like montage of text, music, cinematic
images and highly physical performance art, with the actor suspended in
a harness above a rotating screen. A dramatic distillation of poppy love
it covers the trip Jean Cocteau made to New York in 1949 and the drug
addiction which followed and the experiences of Miles Davis in Paris in
1949, who began a affair with Juliette Greco -- and heroin.
It's all told within the contemporaneous context of a man marrooned in
a Parisian hotel room and hopelessly addicted to love.
The striking, experimental nature of the Canadian director's work
typically divided the critics. The Guardian's Michael Coveney raved that
it was ''the most technically adroit and emotionally coherent
mixed-media presentation I have ever seen'', while The Financial Times
damned it as ''a truly pretentious, self-indulgent bit of theatre''.
''I've never seen anything like it,'' says Bassett, who had gone to
Berlin with reservations, desperately seeking something different and
acutely aware that Lepage's previous work at the Tramway and the
Edinburgh Festival meant that while he has a steadfast following in
Scotland there is also the sense ''that he is over here every five
minutes''.
''Lepage's reputation is obviously useful when it comes to selling out
the King's but it wasn't my reason for seeing it -- if anything, that
would have put me off,'' explains Bassett. ''But any rule you make --
and I try not to make too many -- is always overcome by the quality of
the work you see.''
He's now tight-lipped about the other work he has seen in his frantic
forays around the world's theatre festivals but will say that this year
will see a reduction in the foreign theatre representation, probably a
wise move bearing in mind the poor attendances for many international
shows last year. ''Fewer and better,'' he adroitely explains. ''Mayfest
was never intended to be a cultural marathon, it's only a small audience
who are interested in doing that.''
Having spent 15 years -- ''it felt like 15 minutes'' -- at the
Citizens', latterly as general manager with a significant say in
programming the venue, and having worked on the drama committee of the
Scottish Arts Council, Bassett has a strong committment to local theatre
which will doubtless be reflected in the '95 programme.
There are hints that this year's Mayfest will see a toning down of a
comedy programme, which, in programming big-name English comics who
visit the city all year round anyway, was becoming alien to the
festival's ethos. ''Glasgow should be a factory of culture rather than a
receiving hotel,'' he says.
He hopes to put the much-lamented buzz back into Mayfest, to create
something special and exciting of broad appeal.

SONGS: singers shouldn't take to the stage without 'em. Last night's
openers, the Lost Soul Band, intoned self-penned ditties that owed a
very obvious debt to Bob Dylan, being samey-sounding tales of
jingle-jangle mourning with a subterranean lovesick hue. And words of
po-faced tortured triteness that wid mak' ye grew.
There was one which compelled ''knees'', ''breeze'', and ''trees'' to
rhyme, ending with the tree's leaze . . . sorry, the tree's leaves
turning from green to blue. Eh? A female's surname can change from Brown
to Jones, turning her ex-hubby's eyes from brown to blue, but no way
does it make narrative sense for leaves, fellas.
With four years and three albums behind them, the Lost Soul Band can't
claim to be serving a wordsmith's apprenticeship. But maybe Eleanor
McEvoy can cite a relative lack of experience as the reason for the
colourlessness of her songs.
A couple vaguely resembled Throwing Muses, with percussive
guitar-figures and dramatic, angsty vocal swoops. A couple cast Eleanor
as a more animated Suzanne Vega. There was an outbreak of mainstream
rock balladry and a brief a cappella foray. Pleasant enough, if wholly
unremarkable.
But if you're going to do a song about the therapeutic joy of music,
as Eleanor did, then your lyrics can't be cliches about ''melodies as
potent as wine''. And your melodies should be potent, not plodding.
Yet another of her songs asked, ''Is there no poetry, no melody to
comfort me?'' You'll learn more from life than books and music, chuck.
Go out and get real: there has to be a song in it eventually.

IF music is in the air, then winds from a' the airts must blow over
Galicia, to judge from Na Lua. With every new piece these six
accomplished multi-instrumentalists added another leg to their Cook's
tour-like repertoire.
Quite apart from the influences they admitted to, including a bright
tune with a Portuguese flavour, they took us round the Balkans, across
to Morocco, and down to East Africa before arriving in Scotland with a
mini pipes and drums corps that sat on a rhythm sounding distinctly as
if it had been learned from Wolfstone. This last piece should give added
interest to the two bands' double bill on Wednesday at the Hospitality
Inn.
The Dubliners aren't quite so adventurous or so exotic, managing to
work both Grimsby and Coventry into a set which remained for the most
part on home territory. Even the Spanish Lady they sang of lived in
Dublin. Just entering their thirty-third year, they mostly continue to
do what they've always done best: good-going songs and some rib-tickling
crack, but with a few reminders that they, too, have always been able to
play.
When they veer away from the good-going songs, they're in trouble.
Song For Ireland is wonderful (especially when sung by Mary Black) but
this version should have been the subject of a report to the
procurator-fiscal.
Much better was their duelling mandolines feature and, sung
unaccompanied apart from much understandable chortling, The Sick Note, a
catalogue of building-site disasters likely to deter you from even the
lightest attempts at DIY.

LONDON'S West End seems inundated with staged biographical concerts.
The Patsy Cline show recently folded, but its subject pops up as a minor
character in Only The Lonely, a show devoted to the life and songs of
Roy Orbison.
Pop icon Roy had a great voice and fine songs but little charisma off
stage. He just came on and sang, dressed in black with shades to match.
The compilers of this 40-song tribute have bulked it out with acute
impersonations of some of his fellow stars, including Mick Jagger, the
Beatles, Arthur Brown, and Del Shannon.
Orbison really only lived for his songs and his touring career. His
wife was killed in a motor-cycle accident and two of his sons died in a
house fire. The paper-thin scenario offers us his son Wesley re-living
memories of his father and reconstructing their final meeting -- or
rather the one he'd wished they'd had.
All this is incidental to the songs and the performances. A remarkable
Canadian performer, Larry Branson, is Roy Orbison to the life.
The versatility of the rest of the cast is equally amazing. Anne
Smith's Dusty Springfield was a joy, and so was her k d Lang. You've
simply got to admire a performer (Martin Glyn Murray) who can portray
Bobby Vee, John Lennon, and Bruce Springsteen and do it with conviction.
Bill Kenwright and Ian Kellgren's pacy production comes from the
Liverpool Playhouse. It runs for nearly three hours but doesn't seem
anything like as long.

Margaret Vaughan cautions against expectations of cheaper service
charges now that the banks are rolling in money -- the chances are you
will be paying even more in future
DON'T start dabbing your eyes just yet, but do have a bit of
understanding. Banks have suffered. Oh yes they have! Just because
zeroes are birling and profits have doubled and even tripled doesn't
mean they don't know the meaning of hard times.
You may be totting up the charges on your account, right now,
wondering how it can be that these have escalated by a reported 50%
while the banks are racking up bumper profits. The biggest earnings in
recent memory, according to the pundits.
The explanation is simple. Banks, you see, are so misunderstood.
There's this perception that banks are a social service, explained a
Royal Bank spokesman. Not so! They are in business to make profits for
shareholders. All of the banks' services have to be paid for by
customers in one way or another.
A big part of the hike in profits is simply the banks recouping all
the money they lost in the recession. The money they loaned to all those
businesses that went phut.
Bad debts hit their profits. The property crash cost many banks,
notably Barclays, a packet. Shareholders suffered lowered dividends. Now
recovery is on the way. And so is the prospect of an end to free
banking.
Banking analysts predict that the big banks are waiting to introduce
charges for servicing all accounts, not just those which turn red. The
banks will admit, privately, that only intense competition has stopped
it happening already.
So where is the benefit for customers from the big profits? Is the
hostility towards banks, accused of insensitivity to the needs of small
businesses and individual customers during the recession, justified?
Let's put it in perspective. The Royal Bank opened the reporting
season in December, doubling its profits to #532m. The TSB is expected
to announce profits of #500m, up around #200m. Analysts forecast
National Wesminster profits of #1.5 billion, up from #989m, while
Barclays earnings will triple to #1.8 billion. Lloyds pre-tax profits
will be about #1.2 billion, while the parent company of the Midland Bank
is likely to show pre-tax profits of #2.9 billion, up from #2.5 billion.
Even the douce Bank of Scotland is expected to show a tidy profit of
around #443m, against #269m last year.
The Consumers' Association, meanwhile, says that a combination of
charges on unauthorised overdrafts and interest levied on such accounts,
for even short periods, can be equivalent to millions of per cent, if
translated to an annualised percentage rate basis. It argues that the
high levels of profits intensifies the argument that banks should cut
their charges.
So are the banks raking in profits while rooking customers with high
charges?
Not at all, bristles the British Bankers' Association. It claims that
the banks results show that providing banking services for personal
customers is one of the most unprofitable activities which banks
undertake. And it emphasises that more than three-quarters of personal
customers do not pay charges.
The Shadow Chancellor, Gordon Brown, has warned that, while accepting
that banks are there to make profits for their shareholders, they are a
vital part of the economy. There is, he argues, a public interest in
ensuring that bank charges are reasonable. For this reason he proposes a
statutory banking ombudsman and a regulator to ensure that banks do not
exploit their dominant position.
A Bank of Scotland spokesman said the bank was broadly supportive of
the proposals.
Mr Brown's plan would include a requirement that banks tell customers
in advance of changes in bank charges. The Bank of Scotland had been
doing this for nearly three years, the spokesman said. Nor did the bank
object to publishing a comparison of costs and charges with other banks.
''Banking is a cyclical business and there are good years and bad
years,'' the spokesman said. ''Obviously if one concentrates only on the
good years then any figures can be as misleading as concentrating only
on the bad years.'' Thus, over the past five years, the Bank of Scotland
had earned just over 10% return on average on its shareholders' funds.
The Royal Bank spokesman pointed out that a large chunk of its
increased profits came from an expansion of services on offer. New
mortgate business accounted for a big chunk, while the profits included
#110m from the phenomenally successful Direct Line Insurance business.
Another lump of profits came from its US acquisition, the Citizens
Financial Group, which saw profits rise by 90% to #68m.
And no, said the spokesman, the Royal Bank's charges had not changed
enormously in the past few years. What's more, a recent survey had shown
the bank had the highest level of customer satisfaction among small
businesses of any bank.
So, having weathered the recessionary storms together, will the banks
and their customers emerge together in mutual understanding into the
sunlit days of recovery? Probably around the same time as pigs take
flight.

TIME was when those with a cause to fight, an issue to pursue, or a
matter to contest, confined themselves to rational means.
First they argued, initiating public debate which they aimed to win by
persuasive logic. Then they exerted leverage through recognised
political forums. Legislators were informed, petitioned. If a
sufficiently powerful interest group could be identified, its stolidity
-- and votes -- could be brought to bear.
Today debate and discussion seem largely discounted. The tribunes have
gone and the yobs are in control. Violence is fashionable.
In Europe, at least, mercifully few causes are pursued with bloodshed
and murder. But the first week of 1995 has shown an abundance of
violence in other forms. Obstruction, occupation and vandalism are now
acceptable means of fighting a political campaign. And there are many
today who will not hesitate to use them when beaten, fair and square, in
the accepted arenas of debate.
In the past week dozens of lorry drivers have been terrified, much
property damaged and huge expense incurred by the police, because
ruthless individuals refuse to accept the perfectly legal export of farm
animals.
Over the weekend another group of fruitcakes occupied treehouses on a
park by Glasgow, sworn to prevent the operation of bulldozers due to dig
out a new length of motorway. In the event, the bulldozers were not due,
and the environmentalists couldn't even stop the surveyors.
A Cabinet Minister has been denounced far and wide, and some calling
for his head on a charger, merely because it has been reckoned that
calves sold from his farm might end up in continental veal cages. And by
Calton Hill, I dare say, a little huddle of Scottish nationalists still
keeps vigil by brazier outside the former Royal High School.
No doubt too, in these days of President Mandela, there is somewhere a
supermarket where shoppers are blockaded by trendy radicals until they
agree to buy Cape grapes and South African plonk.
Such agreeable japes are undoubtedly much more fun than writing to the
House of Commons and devising an argument. And they will always appeal
to the ''anorak'' brigade. But they are irrational. They are, by dint of
their essential weapons -- nuisance, interference, intimidation --
violent. And the epidemic, if it goes much further, must seriously
threaten the public good.
Already the extremes of this tendency should alarm sensible people.
That no-one was seriously injured in the Channel ports riots last week
was a miracle. That any normal human being can threaten physical harm to
a scientist -- razor-loaded mousetraps in the post, bombs under his car,
paraquat in his daily pinta -- merely because he produces polio vaccine
from monkeys, should make one reel. Occasionally the humourless
single-issue fanatics simply make fools of themselves.
Blinkered union activists in Dundee, some years ago, proved so
obstructive that a big new car factory was eventually sited elsewhere,
costing Tayside hundreds of jobs. In the mid-eighties, animal rights
nutters ''liberated'' thousands of edible snails from an English farm.
The snails perished within hours because, being French and alien, they
couldn't stand the cold.
All this makes me mad.
It infuriates me because, in the first instance, such steps are
last-ditch and extreme, and are justified in pursuit only of the gravest
cause. Almost all these tactics are derived from -- and many invented by
-- Dr Martin Luther King and the great civil rights campaign of post-war
America. In that context they were entirely justified. Few blacks in the
Deep South of America had the vote. They were surrounded by
institutionalised and repressive bigotry whose agents did not hesitate
to indulge in assault, arson and murder. The very agencies of the law
denied them justice. Smirking sheriffs stood by as churches burned;
neanderthal judges gave suspended sentences for killing blacks.
Today folk happily sing We Shall Overcome as they march forth to save
a coppice of stunted sycamores. Last week windscreens were smashed to
deliver cows from seasickness. The tools of a noble cause are revived to
protect the view from suburban windows, or to spare the sentiments of
matrons with the world view of Beatrix Potter. Such goings-on are an
insult to a great campaign and the Americans who died for it.
In the second instance, many such protests and battles only partly
figure those genuinely committed to the cause. One can be sure today
that the average town centre rammy -- an Anti-Nazi League demo, an
Orange or Republican march -- will star rather more than concerned
anti-racists and students of Irish history. Huge numbers of common
thugs, looters and hoodlums tag along in their wake. In the safety of
the mob, masked and anonymous, they can scream and batter and destroy as
much as they like.
In the third instance, these contrived parades and blockades involve
an even nastier kind of person. It is scarcely original to point out
that animal rights terrorists tend to be coves you wouldn't trust with a
cockroach. Hatred of fellow humanity burns more fiercely in such hearts
than regard for any animal. More seriously, dedicated anarchists and
subversives are happy to seize such platforms for their own ends. I do
not mean people who merely seek a change of Government: don't we all? I
mean people who want to destroy all government, who would happily
decapitate a policeman, who delight in chaos and disorder, who spit on
the rights of property, liberty and public safety.
What should disturb us most is the supporting role of television. In
the early sixties this was a deliberate part of civil rights strategy:
by riling Southern marshalls into unleashing firehoses and guard dogs
before the cameras, the Freedom Riders forced the world to face the
realities of the American dream as lived in Mississippi and Alabama.
Today any prospect of exciting pictures -- people being squashed under
lorries, a young copper with his face smashed like a tomato -- brings
the camera crews running.
There is a problem here which must be addressed. Suppressing the media
is bad. But the copycat riot, or an act of violence which would not be
staged if the TV crews were not shooting, is equally bad; and that is a
modern reality. Television is a sensationalising medium. It is also a
distorting medium. The guarantee of television publicity is as sweet as
honey to fanatics of every hue and the time may now be upon us to smash
the pot.
If the tendency to brutish and illogical confrontation in public
debate goes much further, it would threaten not merely the institutions
on which society depends -- freedom of movement, preservation of
property, a trusted and impartial police force -- but society itself. It
is high time public servants and elected representatives refused to
support or join in such activities. And high time for journalists to
stop glamourising them.

Allan Laing looks back at the satire of Peter Cook, who believed
sacred cows were there to be shot at.
TO TODAY'S right-on generation he must have seemed like the Antichrist
of comedy. Overweight and a sartorial shambles, on his rare television
appearances he constantly smoked high-tar cigarettes and mouthed
politically incorrect -- though funny and accurate -- observations.
But 30 years ago Peter Cook, who died yesterday from a stomach
haemorrhage at the age of 57, was an alternative comedian when there was
no alternative. His weapon was satire and his target was all human life.
His incisive wit helped shape the humour of a generation. Without his
inspiration there would probably have been no Monty Python and no Comedy
Store. Without his money there certainly would have been no Private Eye.
His greatest failing, however, was indolence. He was often bone idle and
proud of it.
Still, his constant and often anarchic comments on power, people, the
media, and society were acute and often gloriously vulgar. In his
wonderful laid-back style he slaughtered sacred cows, exploded modern
myths, and touched the parts which other comedians of his time signally
failed to reach.
He was a brilliant mimic and possessed a wonderful talent for
free-form, off-the-cuff, humour. Latterly, Cook confined his public
outings to the occasional appearances on chat shows but he will best be
remembered for his classic double act with Dudley Moore.
Pete'n'Dud were the cloth-capped philosophers who discussed universal
issues in the ground-breaking Saturday night satirical show of the
sixties, Not Only But Also. The act was later re-invented for the
seventies with the foul-mouthed Derek and Clive. No subject was too
grotesque, no human function too tasteless, and no swear word too
outrageous for the Dagenham duo.
Peter Cook, generally recognised as a comic genius who through his own
self-confessed laziness never quite reached his full potential, was
undoubtedly the creative force behind the pairing. But without Moore's
spark he seemed to achieve relatively little. When the partnership broke
up and Moore set off for Hollywood, Cook's career faltered. This came as
no great surprise to those who knew him, since he always declared that
he had lost all ambition at the age of 24.
But, in truth, Cook simply afforded himself that rarest of luxuries,
of doing what he wanted to do in life. He was a founding father of the
satirical magazine Private Eye. With a 68% stake in the business he was
Lord Gnome himself. This honorary title meant that he could wander in to
the magazine's Soho office every week and type out anonymous jokes. In
return, he would receive a case of claret at Christmas -- providing the
year's libel settlements permitted its purchase.
Peter Cook was the middle-class son of a colonial officer. He intended
to enter the diplomatic service after Radley and Cambridge. But his
university education collided head-on with the start of the sixties and
the first murmurings of the pop culture revolution. He joined the
Cambridge Footlights and later went on in 1960 to the Edinburgh Festival
to mount the satirical revue Beyond The Fringe, along with fellow
students Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, and, of course, Dudley Moore.
Here for the first time in generations was irreverent humour which
poked fun at the establishment. They could even make jokes about the
Prime Minister. Beyond The Fringe, which achieved greater success in the
West End and Broadway, is recognised today as the spark which ignited
contemporary humour in Britain.
Cook, young and still ambitious, then went on to open the first
satirical club in Britain, The Establishment, which had a members list
which included Graham Greene and W Somerset Maugham. However, a
similarly named venture in New York folded when The Scene, a magazine in
which the young satirist had invested, went belly up. At least the
sardonic Cook was able to boast that, for once in his life, he had
brought down The Establishment.
He then teamed up again with his old mate Moore and, between 1965 and
1971, made Pete'n'Dud famously infamous. He was, he said, genuinely
bereft when the duo split up in the seventies, and in 1993 they were
briefly reunited to make an album and video of Derek and Clive Get The
Horn.
Over the years, Peter Cook appeared in some 20 films, sometimes with
Moore in which they played outrageous villains. However, most of his
films were uninspiring. He also appeared in several television series.
His last work -- still to be released -- was a golf video, Peter Cook
Talks Golf Balls, in which he played an overbearing American
commentator, a whisky-sozzled Scottish caddy, a retired major, and a mad
German psychiatrist who concludes that fish possess the ideal shape for
playing golf.
Along the way he married three times. His first wife was Wendy
Snowden, whom he met at Cambridge. They had two daughters, Lucy and
Daisy. His second wife was the actress Judy Huxtable, whom he married in
1973. Five years ago he married Lin Chong Cook, a freelance property
consultant. She was at his bedside at the Royal Free Hospital near his
Hampstead home when he died.
Cook had been admitted there last Tuesday after complaining of feeling
''a bit poorly''. The condition which he died from, gastrointestinal
haemorrhage, is most commonly due to duodenal or sometimes gastric
ulcers.
There was no shortage of tributes to Peter Cook. Describing him as
''completely and utterly irreplaceable'', Monty Python star Michael
Palin said: ''He was a very inventive comic. One of the things he did
was to form the basis of what one would call the new comedy of the
sixties and seventies. His achievement is absolutely extraordinary. He
had this wonderful ability, which I shall greatly miss, to show up the
absurdities of life.''
Dudley Moore, speaking from Hollywood, said of their split: ''I think
he was mildly miffed and he felt to a certain extent betrayed.
''I felt pressure from him that he wanted to do more sketch material
as we had in the past, but I wasn't really willing to do it although I
loved going into the strange stupid voices that we did whenever I saw
him.
''Verbally he was the most witty man I have ever come across and
strangely inventive. The stuff we did towards the end of our careers was
not really the essence of us.
''But we made up over the years and I counted him among my friends if
not my best friend in later years.''
Private Eye editor Ian Hislop said: ''We're all very sorry here. It's
a great loss to British comedy. I knew Peter very well and he was, I
always thought, the funniest man alive. He was the great hands-off
proprietor of all time . . .''
Cook's close friend and fellow satirist Ned Sherrin commented:
''Obviously, he was the first; he was the Guv'nor. Every 10 years or so
you always get a new generation of comedians but they all acknowledge
their debt to Peter.''
Former Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams said: ''I will always
remember him as a very funny person to be with. He was always
improvising jokes which would make you laugh, often for no reason at
all.''

FOR Lesley Clemenson of Edinburgh, the change from traditional
employment to contract working has been a successful one.
After leaving university with an hon. degree in English, she became a
tele-sales girl with the Scotsman newspaper -- winning the Tele-Sales
Girl of the Year Award in 1982/83 -- and progressing to tele-sales
trainer. Later, she moved to posts in two other companies as tele-sales
manager.
After a short career break to have her daughter, now eight, Mrs
Clemenson started contracting for companies in diverse fields from
computing to sports.
It has worked well for her, and is she says, more lucrative than being
employed as well as offering more variety and flexibility. She has a
running contract with Edinburgh University.
''I get treated far better,'' she believes ''The atmosphere is
different because they know you are not a lifetime's commitment.''
Currently, she is setting up a corporate tele-marketing department for
Edinburgh Crystal.
When the children were younger -- her seven-year-old son is
handicapped -- Mrs Clemenson worked mainly at home, now she typically
works outside it, but during school holidays she cuts back sharply on
her workload. She has someone to help look after her son when necessary
and her husband is very supportive.
Lesley Clemenson gets a buzz from making a significant difference to
the businesses for which she works. ''I've specialised in a hands-on and
training role,'' she says, ''Mainly I've had to be a working manager, I
hopefully lead from the front. With tele-marketing I've always expected
people to catch me up, but very few are training in it; it's still just
the newspapers, and people don't move on from them very much. At 35,
I've expected people to come past me, but it hasn't happened, the other
girls involved in it were my contemporaries at the Scotsman.''
Most of Lesley Clemenson's contracts have either come through her
having been headhunted or by her persuading companies that they needed
her. Flexibility, is what she lists as the key quality.

WHATEVER else 1995 may bring, of one thing we can be assured. The year
will see ever-growing numbers of employees join what some occupational
psychologists in America are calling The Contingency Workforce -- in
other words, contract or freelance working.
Last week saw Professor Cary Cooper of Manchester University's
Institute of Science and Technology, address the British Psychology
Society's (BPS) occupational psychology conference on stress in the
workplace, and the closely allied, missing, feel-good factor which
haunts the UK today. ''The subject,'' Cooper believes, ''is the issue of
the decade.''
The huge cultural changes which are currently taking place in British
companies are not mere rogue blips on the screen. Next year, next decade
alas, things will not go back to the way they were. The scenario of
today is the reality, guaranteed only to expand and remain.
What we are seeing is a systematic swing away from the workplace
culture we have known for so long. Ever-slimmer companies increasingly
run with small core labour forces, either contracting out a great
variety of work, or using freelance workers. It is light years away from
the jobs-for-life complacency of the recent past, and a frightening
prospect for those who find it hard to come to terms with the knife-edge
of uncertainty, where long-term planning is often impossible. The social
implications are enormous.
Professor Cooper believes that we are powerless to do anything about
the cultural changes. However, in seeking his counsel for positive
advice with which people can strengthen themselves, he does have a few
pointers. But first, let us set the scene.
When Cooper was asked to speak to the BPS, the subject specified was
stress. ''I replied that there was no point, because all the stress
research that's been carried out has been done on the decks of the
Titanic, fiddling about with the issues, but while the ship was still
stable.
''Now,'' he continues, ''the ship has just been hit by an iceberg and
it's sinking. There's no point in us fooling around: let's discuss how
we're going to deal with the ship when it's subterranean. That's the
issue.''
It concerns Cary Cooper, and doubtless many others, that the huge
social and practical problems brought about by massive changes in the
workplace -- but with implications far beyond the boundaries of work --
are failing to be addressed.
''It's just beginning to be thought about by behavioural scientists
like myself, and occupational psychologists,'' he explains. ''The
Government really needs to get a high level think-tank to consider the
future of work, and what this contract culture will mean for society.
What do we need to deal with it? How do we assess what the impacts are
gradually, so that we can either change, move in a different direction,
and/or provide support? This is a matter of urgency now, because it's
beginning to happen very quickly.''
Although the changes away from core workforces have been gaining
momentum steadily in recent times, it is tempting to think that there is
something in the British psyche which takes comfort in the
head-in-the-sand approach, refusing to contemplate the phenomenom until
it hits home.
During the years of impenetrable union strength when workforces won
wage and salary levels which bore little relationship to productivity
levels, few concerned themselves with the lot of those workers with
least clout, on the outside of factory or office walls. They were a
breed apart, with little if any infrastructure, to protect them.
But ironically now, with their ranks swelling daily with those forced
out of traditional workforces, the hard reality of just how difficult it
is to earn a decent living is dawning -- even for those lucky enough to
have the bonus of a handsome redundancy cheque at their back.
There are the problems of young people trying to get mortgages, when
their financial track record amounts to a couple of one-year contracts;
the worries of a generation told by the Government that they will have
to fund their own pensions, who are often quite unable to negotiate
rates which will enable them to do this while buying homes and raising
families. Right now, the questions pile up and there are few answers.
How can companies and employees try to alleviate the pressures and
stresses of the workplace of the nineties with its work overload, long
hours and most of all, the uncertainty which pervades the world of
employment like a shroud? And what about the family?
Professor Cooper believes that we are powerless to do anything about
the cultural changes. However, he makes some points which may help
people ''psyche up'', to come to terms with and cope with the new ways
of working.
On protracted working hours, he says: ''We should take notice of how
long people are working and ensure that it is reasonable. Long hours
don't mean quality hours.
''It's more likely that a reasonable working week of 40-48 hours will
be productive in the long run, reducing the likelihood of ill health and
allowing the person to have the recharging effects of a life outside
work -- and, very importantly, it protects the family.''
Trying to understand the managers' situation in companies, may also
help to balance attitudes in this age of uncertainty. ''Top managers
don't want to tell their employees the truth because they're frightened
it will scare them even more,'' says Professor Cooper.
''Think about the position of many top managers: they don't want to
lie and say everything will be rosy and no more cutbacks after the last
5000, when that may not be the case.
''They're stressed out either by lying, or concealing the truth.
You'll find there are a lot of problems at the top level of management,
particularly since the people who are having to make these decisions are
the human resource managers or personnel directors. Their business is
helping others in the workplace, not firing them, so their stress levels
are absolutely enormous.''
As a society, we all have to face reality Cooper believes, and that
means realising that job insecurity is here to stay. What the individual
has to do, he thinks, is: ''Make sure you have as many skills as
possible, go on every training course you are offered; learn about new
technology; keep as open a mind as possible, and learn how to market
yourself.
''It's all about the individual gaining control of the situation which
they have no control over, and which even the senior people in the
organisation have no control over. We must understand that jobs are no
longer for life, and that you may be moving about and being much more of
a contract/freelance type of person.
''On leaving your organisation, you may not find another, or they may
take you on on a different basis, on part-time or short-term working. We
must ensure that people understand that that is what the expectation in
their heads should be. We should work at not being frightened of
change.''
To a large extent, companies are in a similar situation to their
employees, they are confronted by changes happening all around them:
keeping labour costs down, bringing in new technology, being encouraged
to contract out more and more people, especially white collar
professionals.
Just a few further implications are: who provides the training for
people who are going to be contract workers since there will be no
employers doing this? How do we as an economy, protect them in an
economic sense? How do we encourage building societies to lend to those
on short-term contracts?
''What troubles me is that we see it coming, but nobody's talking
about it, no-one's doing any research on it. What is the impact?'' asks
Professor Cooper. ''What is the impact in the media where it's been
running five-seven years already as a contract culture industry?
''Has it increased productivity? Has it saved a lot of money? Has it
produced quality products? Has it damaged the health of people? Has it
made them better off? What's going on? I don't know the answers. All I
can do is hypothesise.
''The family life aspect is also going to be horrendous. Parents
working from home; working long hours because you can't say 'no'; how
does that interfere with family life? What does that do to the
children?''
There are questions aplenty. Our most pressing need is to find some of
the answers.

HOWEVER misconceived, there is no doubt that the emergency services
have a glamorous image with the public. The flashing lights and whining
sirens lend an air of excitement to the job, and the thought of dealing
effectively with life-and-death situations appeals to many people.
Like any other job, much of the work of the ambulance service is
routine, but there also an element of unpredictability and sense of
danger that can be exhilarating and naturally suits some personalities.
People generally have very little idea about what ambulance crews do
in medical terms, but they know what they expect of them.
''Above all, they expect us to care,'' said Marcia Neef, an ambulance
officer based at the Scottish Ambulance Service's National Training
Centre in Glasgow. ''They see us as the cavalry arriving when the chips
are down, and they expect us to take the burden away from them.''
As an ambulance officer, Marcia has reached the highest uniformed rank
in the Scottish Ambulance Service. It covers a geographical area which
is one-third of the size of the UK and a population of more than five
million, deals with 300,000 accident and emergency cases every year.
There are 400 A &amp; E vehicles operating from 150 stations throughout
Scotland.
Of the 2623 staff, 1400 are employed in Accident &amp; Emergency and 650
are involved in the Patient Transport Service. The service also plans to
train 696 paramedics by 1997, providing one paramedic on every A &amp; E
vehicle.
There are some basic natural abilities which are vital to the job.
Decision-making, unflappability, patience and a sense of responsibility
are all necessary attributes together with communication and other
practical skills.
Above all, it is necessary to care, and without a doubt this enhances
the efficiency in doing the job.
Those abilities, together with the various training programmes offered
by the service, ensure the maximum efficiency of staff.
Corps Ambulance Service training is given at three levels: Patient
Transport Service, Accident &amp; Emergency and Paramedic levels.
The basic Patient Transport Service training is a two-week residential
course. Most of the work involved in this service is routine, taking and
returning patients from home to hospital for appointments, as well as
hospital transfers and regular attendance at day clinics.
First aid is part of the course and this is currently carried out
through the Health &amp; Safety Executive First Aid in the Workplace course.
Lifting and handling is another aspect, since much of the work entails
coping with elderly patients or those with painful conditions.
The trainees learn to use the range of lifting equipment and the
kinetics of lifting to protect themselves and minimise the wear and tear
on their own bodies. There is plenty of role play, with a room mocked up
as a bedroom-cum-living room to allow lifting practice. ''Patients'' are
also transported downstairs to a waiting ambulance.
A third element is the driving. No special licence is required. On the
PTS training course the trainees spend a week driving under the watchful
eye of an instructor. There is a three-to-one trainee to instructor
ratio. Because of the nature of the job, there is a lot of reversing and
manoeuvring.
An increasing number of young women are now joining the service. Most
have not driven anything bigger than a saloon car, so it is vital for
them to become familiar with the vehicles.
The Accident &amp; Emergency Course is nine weeks long and residential.
Two weeks of this is devoted to the driving aspects of the job.
Surprisingly, the emergency services do not have an automatic right of
way and, as Marcia Neef explains, emergency driving situations require
caution: ''My basic philosophy is that blue lights and horns don't
change anything'' she says. ''They don't change your capabilities as a
driver, they don't change the handling characteristics of the vehicle
and they don't change the existing road conditions.
''Although we do have exceptions in law to exceed speed limits, for
example if the vehicle is being used for a genuine emergency, there are
also a number of exemptions.
''The law allows us to treat the red traffic light as a ''Give Way''
but, as in every other case, at a ''Give Way'' sign you must give way to
people who have the right of way. We can't afford to assume that they
will stop.
''We can exercise the exemption but this does not absolve us from
blame in the case of an accident.''
At the end of the Accident &amp; Emergency course students are taken out
on operational drives, with the co-operation and support of Glasgow
Control. The trainees go for real patients so that they are experiencing
999 call-outs under controlled circumstances, with a trainer sitting in
the background.
The A &amp; E course also covers theory, from anatomy and physiology to
actual patient care. Many of those on the course have come from the
Patient Transport Service as well as from the general public who apply.
All applicants must meet the pre-entry criteria.
Trainee A &amp; E technicians also learn about the full range of equipment
carried. Every A &amp; E ambulance, for example, carries a defibrillator in
case of cardiac arrest, and the technicians are trained to use it. These
defibrillators have been supplied through public donation, following the
Heart Start initiative in 1988, when the British Heart Foundation
combined with the service to raise money for defibrillators in vehicles.
Since then, there have been 12,000 defibrillation incidents recorded
and 900 lives saved. The Heart Start initiative clearly showed that the
best success rate in terms of defibrillation occurs when the person is
with the ambulance crew.
Not surpisingly, given the high profile of paramedics on American TV
shows, the service is inundated by requests to join. It is impossible,
however, to become a paramedic without first being an Accident/Emergency
technician.
Marcia said: ''People think it involves three months of training at
the centre, in hospital and on-the-road practice. What they do not
realise is that you have to be an A &amp; E technician for two years.
''When the A &amp; E technicians leave the course here, they go to a
station and are on probation for a year. They are not actually qualified
until they end of that year. During that time they are monitored,
quarterly assessed in the workplace.
''Then they must do a qualified operational year. After that before
they can even apply to sit the paramedic pre-entry theoretical and
practical examination and the interview.
0 ''This is a stiff process. You cannot have the skills on the
paramedic course in isolation. They are built on a whole range of skills
and experience that people can gain only by being an A &amp; E technician.''
Paramedic training is still in its infancy: and many of the techniques
learned were practised only by doctors in the past. Paramedics have been
introduced to improve the level of care in the pre-hospital phase where
those patients require it.
''It is about getting the right level of care to the patient that
needs it, and having the skills available when they are required,'' said
Marcia Neef. ''It also involves making the right clinical judgment in
terms of the skills required to improve the patient's existing condition
or possibly to save life, and getting them to hospital in a viable
condition.''
* Anyone interested should contact their local ambulance division or
write to the Personnel Dept at National Headquarters in Edinburgh, or
watch the press for jobs coming up. Job centres or professional journals
are further sources of information.

FRASER NELSON reports on the efforts of student unions to ensure their
patrons get home safely -- whether they have been studying or
celebrating.
DRIVING a full load of semi-conscious students in 1992 put off taxi
driver James McTulloch for good. Five were in the back, and by the end
of the journey three had thrown up. They paid by cheque.
Now Mr McTulloch won't go anywhere near the student unions after
midnight. For students unwilling to part with the average #4 taxi fare
in a city such as Glasgow, braving the elements on foot is often the
only option.
Student unions, however, are offering an alternative. In an initiative
which is becoming part of campus life, unions are funding minibuses or
hiring bus companies to make sure students get home safely.
The services offered vary from Saturday night specials to minibuses
operating seven days a week, as happens at Stirling and Dundee
universities. At weekends, most universities run a service until 2am.
Fees, where charged, never exceed 50p and students are dropped at their
door.
A night with students at Glasgow University's minibus rank reveals
that students warmly welcome the transport home. ''If it wasn't for the
minibuses'', says Neil Brannigan, on his way back home from the library,
''I would have to brave a three-mile walk in darkest Glasgow, just to
get back in time for dinner.''
While students are no more susceptible to assault than anyone else,
few groups in society are likely to stagger home from the union in a
nonchalant frame of mind at 3am. It is this vunerability which unions
are trying to reduce.
Glasgow University's minibus, which provides a service for students
returning to halls of residence after studying, stops at 9pm, mainly
because a night-time service would take on a life of its own.
The point made by taxi drivers and minibus organisers alike is this:
driving students home from the library is one thing, driving them back
from the union in the early morning is another.
James Donoghue is a student driver employed by Stirling University to
drive its student nightbus, a task few taxi drivers would fight for. The
experience, he says, is enlightning: ''I drive students to the union
when they're sober and then take them back when they're not. This way,
you see both sides to their characters; the difference can be
phenomenal.
''I end up taking the roles of samaritan, councillor and chauffeur all
in one night.
''The gossip, though, is superb. For some reason, they don't realise
that I am a student, like them. You are in the middle of everything from
the end-of-night summaries to the occasional melodrama. As far as
scandal goes, you end up being one of the best-informed students on
campus.''
As a school for scandal, students who have been drinking provide
first-class entertainment. But the joke soon turns sour if someone is
sick. This, according to minibus organisers, is the big drawback.
St Andrews University minibus seats, for instance, are occasionally
enhanced with plastic sheets. Glasgow University's student drivers have
said they want grills and sick buckets if the service is extended past
9pm.
For student unions, fundraising is the biggest problem. Minibuses cost
#20,000 each, money which few student unions can afford. But for
Aberdeen University union, the saviour was its largest-selling product
-- beer. By adding 1p to the price of a pint, it raises #16,000 a year,
funding the hire of four double-decker buses until 2am.
Edinburgh University buses are subsidised at local authority level.
Other unions seek funding from the universities themselves. But for
institutions such as Glasgow University the Students' Representative
Council pays for the service. At Glasgow it has bought the minibus.
But even if funds are found, some schemes never take off, as
Heriot-Watt University's Paul Cowie explains. ''We tried to lay on a
service but it was underused to the point of being empty. The financial
strain was just killing us. We just had to let it go.''
St Andrews University union struck gold when the local coach company
offered to run the night service for a mere #30 per night -- as a
thank-you to St Andrews students for their custom over 30 years.
The owner, Mrs Peggy Bruce, said: ''The students are like a family to
me. I care about them and feel I have to look after them. What angers me
is that some taxis will refuse to pick up a student if he or she is
drunk. What if something happened to that student later on? I couldn't
live with the guilt.
''The nightbus service doesn't run at a profit. In fact, it runs at a
small loss. But there's more to a bus service than profit. The students
have given me my livelihood. They've looked after us, now we're looking
after them.''
The drive for campus safety is likely to go much further. There are
already plans for phone points to be installed throughout a couple of
campuses so students can ring to be picked up.
Some unions with a limited minibus service are proposing a US-style
system which involves volunteers walking solitary students home. The
volunteers then cycle back. Attack alarms are also freely available to
students to borrow for the journey home.
The drawbacks of taking drunk students home, however, are unlikely to
disappear. But to Mrs Bruce, the problems are not insurmountable. ''We
do have little accidents on the buses now and again, but these things
happen. The students are perfectly behaved. Some are just bad
travellers, I suppose.''
'STUDENTS . . . One of the biggest liabilities in the business. Don't
get me wrong -- I'd pick them up from the university any day. But after
dark, coming back from the unions, they're a different breed.'
- Taxi driver James McTulloch

A MURDER victim's mother, who has campaigned for more than three years
for an inquiry into the police's handling of the case, yesterday accused
the Scottish Office of being involved in a cover-up.
Mrs Effie Drummond criticised officials in St Andrew's House for
accepting a report from Fife Chief Constable William Moodie into the
circumstances surrounding the investigation.
Mrs Drummond, 66, of St Andrews, said: ''The police and the Scottish
Office have turned my son's murder into a farce. This whole
investigation stinks and everyone is ignoring the truth. The chief
constable is covering up for his men and his report is a pack of lies.''
Her claims follow an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the
death of Mr Sandy Drummond, a former soldier. He was strangled and
dumped on a farm track near his home on the outskirts of St Andrews in
June 1991.
During a fatal accident inquiry into his death, a pathologist,
Professor Anthony Busuttil, of Edinburgh University, criticised police
at the scene for failing to spot signs that Mr Drummond had been
murdered. The body was also removed before a full forensic examination
of the area.
Mrs Drummond said: ''Professor Busuttil's criticism of the police
handling of the investigation has been completely ignored by the
Scottish Office. The claims that a full-scale murder inquiry was
launched by the police the day after Sandy's body was found is also a
lie. It wasn't until the case was highlighted on the BBC Crimewatch
programme many months later that police said they were treating it as
murder.
''Until then, all they would say was that my son's death was
suspicious. It meant that people questioned during the investigation
were not aware it was murder.''
The intervention of the Scottish Office and the questioning of the
chief constable followed a plea by Mrs Drummond to the Prime Minister.
The Scottish Office's Home and Health Department ordered Mr Moodie to
have another look at it and prepare a report.
A spokesman at the Scottish Office said yesterday: ''The case is still
open and will remain so until a successful conviction is secured. There
will, however, be no further inquiry by the Scottish Office into the
police handling of the case.''
The investigation into Mr Drummond's death is one of the longest and
most detailed inquiries carried out by Fife Police. It has used an
incident room with a computer database and has taken up more than 16,000
man-hours, almost 600 statements, and almost 1000 questionnaires.

<HEADLINE>Capping is condemned as Borders face cuts</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE chief executive of Borders region has condemned the Government's
capping limit for his council's expenditure in 1995-96, and warned that
the region faces what is probably the most serious programme of budget
cuts in its 20-year history.
Mr Kenneth Clark says in a report going before the policy and
resources committee today: ''The capping limit is quite unrealistic and
one cannot escape the conclusion that it is intended to be punitive.
''The fact that the council has for many years had an exemplary record
and a proud reputation for prudent and careful housekeeping seems to
have been completely ignored.''
The region's projected expenditure for next year exceeds the
Government's capping limit by #4.8m, or 5.1%.
''The 5% reductions which will have to be introduced are likely to
result in a combination of real cuts in services coupled with the
likelihood of an unacceptably high increase in council tax,'' Mr Clark
said.
The Independent-controlled council will be presented today with a
number of suggested ways of reducing the budget. These include
introducing or increasing charges for services, entering into
partnerships with the private sector to run services and finance capital
schemes, reducing or removing discretionary services, and selling assets
to reduce service costs.
Details have also been prepared of a voluntary redundancy scheme for
council employees aged more than 50.
The Government has allotted the Borders Scotland's lowest permitted
1995-96 increase in gross annual expenditure. It shares with Dumfries
and Galloway and Central regions a figure of 1.2%, compared with the
2.2% allowed to Grampian and Highland.

SCIENTISTS have developed techniques which could sharply reduce the
use of laboratory animals in drug trials.
Encouraging results of the first year of tests will be revealed to a
meeting of experts in Edinburgh today. Animal rights campaigners have
welcomed the initiative.
Researchers at Dundee University are engaged in a #3m drug development
programme which involves growing genetically engineered cells for
testing drugs and creating models emulating the human metabolism.
Fourteen drug companies are involved in the five-year programme,
initiated under the Government's Link Scheme for collaboration between
industry and colleges.
Seventy scientists from industry and universities will begin a two-day
meeting in Edinburgh today to review the first-year results of the
project.
Professors Roland Wolf and Brian Burchell are directing the project in
the university's Biomedical Research Centre at the city's Ninewells
Hospital.
Professor Wolf said: ''We are very excited about the prospects of this
research. We expect it to increase the rate that drugs come on to the
market, allow more effective drugs to be designed, and allow us to make
some predictions about possible adverse drug reactions.''
Mr John Robins, organising secretary of Animal Concern, said: ''This
is a recognised way forward in reducing and hopefully eliminating animal
research. We would like to see stronger legislation so these
alternatives to animal tests are utilised as fully as possible. This is
definitely a step in the right direction and it's good to see someone
looking forward.''

A SECOND public inquiry into plans to build an electricity
interconnector linking Scotland and Northern Ireland gets under way
today in Larne.
An inquiry being held in Ayr into the joint proposal by ScottishPower
and Northern Ireland Electricity to build more than 40 miles of pylons
across south Ayrshire, a converter station, and an undersea cable has
been under way since October and resumes today.
The proposed #175m project has met with opposition on both sides of
the Irish Sea from MPs and an MEP, landowners, and local communities.
In Scotland, opponents including Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for
Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and MEP Alex Smith, claim the plan to
erect more than 200 pylons will create serious health risks, amount to
environmental vandalism, and damage tourism.
They also claim that the project would bring no benefits to anyone
other than the two electricity companies.
However, the power companies argue that the deal, worth #30m a year
for at least 15 years, is one of the biggest energy contracts ever
signed in the UK and could create more than 200 miners' jobs in
Scotland, safeguard the livelihoods of 7000 power workers, and benefit
consumers in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
ScottishPower has also pointed out it would cost 15 times as much to
run the power line underground.
The Ayr inquiry has heard claims that ScottishPower adopted
heavy-handed tactics to persuade farmers and landowners to release land
for the proposed interconnector. The company has denied these claims.
The inquiry has also heard claims by anti-pylon campaigners that
European Union Ministers no longer considered the interconnector to be a
priority project.
The power companies countered that the project had already been
approved and EU funding was secured.
Objectors in Northern Ireland, including Mr John Hume, leader of the
SDLP, and the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the DUP, have expressed concern
about the economic viability of the scheme.
Councils in Belfast, Newtonabbey, Carrickfergus, Derry, and Larne are
also opposed to the proposal.
Mr Struan Stevenson, of the Ayrshire-based Stop the Overhead
Powerlines campaign and a director of PS Public Affairs consultants who
are acting on Stop's behalf, claims that the improvement in the security
situation in Northern Ireland and the imminent reconnection of the
electricity link to the Republic, blown up by the IRA in 1974, has made
the case for the Scottish interconnector untenable.
Mr Stevenson argued yesterday that the building of a new power plant
in Northern Ireland would create much-needed employment in the area,
lower electricity prices, and produce significant export income from
sales of electricity to Eire.
He added: ''This would be a much more realistic and economically
viable option than interconnection with Scotland and is widely supported
by most people in the province.
''The utility companies' plans create an effective monopoly and are
anti-competitive.''
He added that opponents of the scheme were confident the inquiries
would find in their favour.
The final decision on whether the project will proceed rests with the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the
Secretary of State for Transport, who is responsible for the undersea
section.
A decision is not expected for several months.

WHEN the black prison bus this morning removes killer Thomas Campbell
from Glasgow to Shotts, the famous Barlinnie Special Unit will be
effectively closed.
Campbell, the man convicted of the Glasgow ice cream war killings, is
the last prisoner to leave, bringing an era to an end, although the
Scottish Prison Service has nominated Friday as officially the last day.
A new chapter will open, however, with the opening shortly of the
National Induction Unit at E Hall of Shotts Prison, a continuation of
the small units principle which was born with the Barlinnie Special Unit
and which, the SPS insists, is not being abandoned.
There could, in the short term, be storms ahead over Campbell's
position. He has used his three years at the Barlinnie Special Unit to
continue his high-profile campaign to establish that the key evidence
against him was fabricated by two senior Glasgow detectives, both now
dead, and that the witness whose evidence sealed his fate was coerced
into perjury.
But when he arrives at Shotts, his security category rating will be
raised to A, the highest, meaning that his ability to communicate with
the outside world will be severely restricted. SPS policy is that the
rights and wrongs of individual convictions are not a matter for them
but for other parts of the criminal justice system.
Campbell's supporters are consequently planning to raise the profile
of the Free the Glasgow Two campaign -- the other prisoner being
Campbell's co-accused, Joe Steele -- establishing a headquarters in
Shettleston, Glasgow.
Campbell yesterday told The Herald that he intended to wear his Free
the Glasgow Two T-shirt on entry to Shotts Prison this morning. He fully
expects to be told that it is unacceptable and he anticipates
confrontation. He said he would refuse to co-operate with the prison
authorities and threatened to resume his hunger strike of previous
years, claiming that as an innocent man he is entitled to have his own
food brought in.
He said yesterday: ''There is always an exception to every rule and
the Barlinnie Special Unit was that exception. It worked. The fact that
it worked outwith the direct control of the headquarters of the Scottish
Prison Service is the real reason why it has been closed.
''If, when I go to Shotts, I spend one day without eating in protest
then that shows the need for a place like the special unit. There is
always going to be a need for special facilities to deal with people
with very special problems.''

GOVERNMENT aid to build a new pier and ferry terminal in Stornoway was
confirmed yesterday.
Following the disclosure in The Herald last month that the pier is in
a dangerous condition, the Scottish Transport Minister, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, announced capital grant assistance of up to #2.9m
towards a replacement.
However, the final piece of the financial jigsaw remains. The #7.65m
project by Stornoway Pier and Harbour Commission hinges on receiving
funds through the European Union's Objective One programme for the
Highlands and Islands.
An application for these funds has been held over from last October
because a financial package was not in place.
The committee set up to administer Objective One applications in the
Highlands and Islands is now expected to meet at the beginning of March.
The harbour commission's general manager, Mr Murdoch McLeod, yesterday
reiterated his warning that a crisis point had been reached. An
engineer's report found that reinforcements inside the concrete pier
were corroding and the structure would have to be demolished.
''It's imperative we get the necessary funding. The pier is in a
dangerous state and cannot be used for much longer,'' Mr McLeod said.
He added that the commission welcomed the Scottish Office assistance
and had been delighted with the co-operation received.
The CalMac ferry Suilven which uses the pier is to be replaced with a
new #16m vessel for the Ullapool-Stornoway route this year. The new
ferry terminal and pier is needed to handle the larger and faster
vessel.
The commission plans to create a the pier and terminal at Newton
Basin, within the current harbour. It has applied for 75% of the cost
from the EU fund but expects to have to make a sizeable contribution
from its own coffers.
Lord James said yesterday that improved transport links with the
Western Isles would be of considerable benefit to island residents,
businesses, and tourists.
He added: ''The combination of a new larger and faster vessel for the
route, together with a new ferry terminal and pier which will be able to
handle the larger capacity provided by the new vessel, while reducing
congestion in Stornoway, means additional traffic can be carried which
should provide significant economic benefits for Lewis and Harris.''

THE recruitment of the 32 prison officers and three supervisors to man
the Scottish Prison Service's new National Induction Unit at Shotts
Prison is already well under way.
In the long view, what will appear now to the hard right and to the
tabloids as another rather indulgent soft option, mollycoddling
murderers and rapists after sentence by the courts, should considerably
reduce prison costs to taxpayers.
The need to house more and more difficult and dangerous prisoners
outwith the mainstream in costly special units could be reduced or even
eliminated.
The relative costs are #75,000 a year for a prisoner in a special unit
and #26,000 annually for a prisoner in the mainstream.
That alone should concentrate the minds of those who believe that
prison should simply be about punishment -- a philosophical confusion,
since it is the court which is about punishment and victims.
At a serious risk of tempting fate, the recent headline problems of
the English prison system -- with their capacity to destabilise -- could
be avoided.
The riots and hostage takings which marred the Scottish criminal
justice system in the late 80s and early 90s could be consigned to the
past. The purpose of the new unit is to head off trouble.
The SPS senior manager most closely identified with the induction
unit, Mr John Pearce, one of two area directors, uses an analogy of
fishing bodies from a river.
You can either become very proficient at doing that or you can look
upstream to find out where the bodies are coming from. The chances are
that there will be a hole in a bridge which can be plugged.
The point he makes is that, at the outset, the long-term prisoner is
often forced to set his stall out in relation to the immediate prison
culture.
''It became very clear from my personal knowledge of many people in
the small units that the serious trouble they were in was traceable back
to where they started off, and that was most often on the wrong foot,''
he said.
''When they are at their most vulnerable, facing a very lengthy
sentence, they are frequently forced by the sub-culture and by the rules
into making choices.''
American research, particularly that of Hans Toch, one of the world's
leading penologists -- who has been working with the SPS on these
problems -- has also indicated that long-term prisoners have different
needs and agendas.
There is a serious ''coping gap'', the need for a young man to embrace
the prospect of becoming a middle aged man behind bars. It is easy for a
man to look back 10 or 15 years, but very difficult to look forward
five.
His requirements will include -- curiously -- security, safety,
privacy, and stimulation. The choice for the service is to carry on
getting better at handling problem prisoners at a late stage, or to
intervene early.
While other prison systems have assessment units, Scotland will
possibly be the first in the world to attempt a genuine induction unit.
The staff at Shotts E Hall, under the current Barlinnie Special Unit
governor, Ms Sue Brooks, will be attempting to repair the hole in the
bridge to prevent the rest of the system having to fish out bodies
downstream.

EXPENDITURE of #90,000 a year on Strathclyde region's Brussels office
had been justified many times over in terms of winning EU funding for
council projects, according to the depute chief executive, Mr John
Anderson.
He was responding to criticism from Conservative MEP Bryan Cassidy
about local authorities wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds on
offices in Brussels.
Mr Cassidy also claimed that there was a large element of ''keeping up
with the municipal Joneses'' involved. If one region had an office,
everyone else wanted one.
As the twenty-second UK outpost prepared to open in Brussels -- this
time flying the flag for Dorset and Hampshire -- the practice has been
attacked by Mr Cassidy as ''an excuse for jollies for councillors''.
Mr Cassidy said: ''If local authorites want to get their hands on more
Euro-dosh, they should be opening offices in London, not Brussels,
because most of these decisions have to go through a national government
department first.''
He pointed out that Dorset already did ''jolly well'' from the
Brussels kitty without the need for an office there.
Areas such as Strathclyde, Birmingham, and Manchester ran
single-authority offices in Brussels. Others ran regional offices, such
as the North of England and Yorkshire and Humberside.
''Everyone seems to think they must have a European department these
days. It's a growth area of local government. It's a case of European
jobs for the boys and girls,'' said Mr Cassidy.
But Strathclyde's Mr Anderson said: ''I suppose there is some feeling
about keeping up with the Joneses on the basis that our office in
particular has been so successful. Other authorities maybe feel left out
because they are not getting the same level of success and may feel they
have to do something along the same lines.
''But to suggest it's being done purely for the regional profile is
crazy.
''The other reason why we have the European office is to filter back
information. No-one is suggesting that the European officer can do
everything on her own. She is able to filter back information and advice
to departments on what grants are available.''
Mr Anderson said an obvious example was the recent flooding disaster,
for which the council got #400,000 following advice from the Brussels
office.

EDINBURGH could be the first city in Britain to create car-free
housing zones in and around its centre.
Lothian region's transportation committee passed a recommendation
yesterday to investigate the proposal further.
The Royal Infirmary, due to be closed, has been suggested as a site
where residents could be discouraged from having a car, and car-pooling
would be promoted.
Convener David Begg said: ''The recent Royal Commission on
environmental pollution highlighted the dangers of increased car use. We
are saying car ownership itself should be discouraged because, if you
buy a car, it is in your interest to use it. The 59% increase in car
ownership in Edinburgh in the last decade is the highest in Europe.''
Last year, the region joined the Car-free Cities Club -- a European
network dedicated to reducing car use. Yesterday's recommendation was
based on the example of Bremen and Berlin.
''Many people don't want to live in a car-infested environmment, as
the European example shows,'' Mr Begg said. ''They want clean air, peace
and quiet, and safe streets for their children.'' He added that the plan
had so far met with cross-party support and approval from the private
housing sector.
City centre areas have been chosen for the pilot scheme because of
easy access to public transport, shops, and facilities. ''Edinburgh
won't be car-free unless people's lifestyles drastically change, but at
least this is a start,'' Mr Begg said.

ANGRY scenes took place inside and outside a Scottish court yesterday
when a mother of five made a brief private appearance on breach of the
peace charges.
Members of Mrs Anne Graham's family, including her 39-year-old husband
Gordon, turned up at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court accompanied by a number of
others including several noisy young men.
Reporters and photographers were sworn at by some of the men and one
was ejected from the building after a scuffle with a court official.
Minutes later a man was seen urinating against the court wall and
later he lunged at a woman photographer when members of Mrs Graham's
family and friends tried to shield her from the press.
It is understood a lawyer's car parked outside the court also suffered
damage on the bonnet, boot, and roof.
Later a Kirkcaldy police official confirmed ''investigations are being
carried out into alleged incidents at Kirkcaldy Sheriff court today''.
Mrs Graham, 35, of 140 Alexander Road, Glenrothes, appeared from
custody before honorary sheriff Walter Simpson and was represented by
local lawyer Krista Johnston.
Later depute fiscal David Scott said Mrs Graham faced five charges of
breach of the peace.
He added that she made no plea or declaration and was released on bail
pending further investigations.
Later a Fife police spokesman said: ''A man is in custody and is
expected to appear at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court following alleged
incidents inside the court.
''Inquiries into alleged incidents outside the court are continuing.''

A MONK faces five charges of indecency against boys at the
#6000-a-year Roman Catholic school where he was head teacher. Brother
Cyril -- real name John Dyer -- is to appear in court later this month
to face four charges of indecent assault and one of gross indecency, all
involving boys under 16, after an investigation at St John's College,
Southsea, Hampshire. Brother Cyril, 48, a former pupil at St John's,
worked at the school for 11 years. He left his post in the summer.

A WREN who was sacked from the Royal Navy nine years ago for becoming
pregnant has rejected a possible six-figure sum in Ministry of Defence
compensation in order to get her old job back. Mrs Donna Ward, 33, is to
become the first ''mother-Wren'' to be reinstated after she turned down
the likely windfall and chose to rejoin the Senior Service with just a
#2000 award for ''injured feelings''.
Mrs Ward, from Portsmouth, said it was easy to reject the money in
order to get back into uniform. ''I was only ever interested in becoming
a Wren again,'' she said.

HORSE trainer Ridley Lamb had drunk the equivalent of eight pints when
the car he was driving plunged into a harbour killing himself and jockey
Alan Merrigan, it was revealed yesterday.
Mr Lamb's judgment would have been seriously impaired after a heavy
bout of drinking at a pub in the Northumberland fishing village of
Seahouses, an inquest at Ashington was told.
Pathologist David Smith revealed that Mr Lamb's blood alcohol level
was 276mg in 100ml -- almost three-and-a-half times the legal driving
limit of 80mg.
''That is the equivalent of drinking about eight pints of beer or 12
fluid ounces of whisky,'' he said.
''This amount would seriously impair a person's judgment and
co-ordination and, in my view, it could have been a significant
contributory factor to the cause of the accident.''
The North Northumberland deputy coroner, Mr Nicholas Garside, recorded
a verdict of accidental death by drowning on both men.
Mr Lamb, 39, a winner of the Gold Cup in 1987 on The Thinker, lost
control of his Ford Sierra as he drove home Mr Merrigan and two other
passengers, ex-jockey Steve Charlton and stable girl Caroline Budge.
The car failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crashed through wooden
sleepers, and turned over into 10ft of water.
Mr Charlton and Miss Budge managed to escape but Mr Lamb and
30-year-old Mr Merrigan were drowned.
Mr Charlton, now a jockeys' valet, told the hearing he had been on
holiday in Seahouses on the night of the tragedy, July 24 last year.
Mr Lamb, a good friend, had invited him for a night out at the
Schooner Inn along with Mr Merrigan and Miss Budge, a stable girl at Mr
Lamb's yard.
They had begun drinking at about 10pm and stayed until about 2am. Mr
Lamb had been giving the three a lift home when the accident occurred.
''I didn't notice anything until I felt and heard the impact of us
hitting the timber on the edge of the harbour,'' said Mr Charlton.
''The next I remember was hearing and feeling the car hitting the
water. It was dark and we were disoriented, to say the least.''
''I felt the water travelling up my legs and body and within seconds
the car was totally full of water.''
Mr Charlton and Miss Budge escaped through one of the windows before
being hauled to safety.
Mr Lamb was still in the car when it was lifted on to the harbourside
but Mr Merrigan had managed to get out of the car and his body was later
retrieved from the water.
County Wicklow born Alan Merrigan, whose most notable wins came on
Blazing Walker and The Thinker, had been visiting Mr Lamb to discuss
riding for him.
His alcohol level was 208mg in 100ml of blood -- equivalent to about
six pints of beer.
Summing up the coroner said: ''This is a very sad case -- particularly
so because of the people involved. Mr Lamb had been a successful
National Hunt jockey and had started a career in training that looked
like being a success. I understand that Mr Merrigan was well thought of
in National Hunt circles.
''The police have indicated that the car did not appear to deviate
when it should have been steered slightly left-handed.
''The obvious cause of this accident must be the driving of Mr Lamb --
he was in charge. There are no other factors that could have
contributed.''

AN inquiry is being demanded by Aberdeen MP Bob Hughes after the
disclosure that Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust is facing a deficit
approaching #1m in the current financial year.
Mr Hughes plans to write to the Scottish Secretary demanding an
explanation and also an assurance that patient care will not be affected
by the overspending.
A spokesman for the trust yesterday confirmed that at the moment they
will be #800,000 overspent at the end of March. He said, however, that
the situation had been caused by ''a very busy spell'' in intensive care
which was an expensive medical facility and in neonatal, the special
nursery for babies, which was also very expensive to run.
He said there had been a number of road accidents in the past year and
an increasing number of babies requiring treatment in the special unit.
He said they would be renegotiating with Grampian Health Board and would
''be coming in on budget''.
''We spend #800,000 every two-and-a-half days,'' he said. ''It is less
than 1% of our budget. This will mean no staff reductions and no
cutbacks in patient care. In fact we are increasing our number of
consultants.'' However, Grampian Health Board's director of finance, Mr
Alex Smith, said: ''Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust are responsible
for the management of the services they provide and the board expects
the terms of the contracts placed with the trust to be met.
''Grampian Health Board is the main purchaser of services provided by
the Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust. We are aware of cost pressures
being faced by the trust and have been kept advised of the situation by
their management.
''Steps are being taken by the trust to contain costs and the health
board will ensure that this will not affect patient services.
''The majority of contracts which the board has with Aberdeen Royal
Hospitals NHS Trust are negotiated around an agreed level of activity.
Where trust activity is in excess of the contracted level then the board
will negotiate a contract adjustment to take account of this.''
Mr Hughes, who was one the leading campaigners against the opt out of
Foresterhill Hospital complex, said: ''We need a clear explanation as to
how they have managed to become overspent and we also need to know if
this is the full extent of the overspend, particularly since waiting
lists are growing and there are a lot of staff vacancies at senior
level.
''I will be writing to the Scottish Secretary demanding an explanation
from him as to how they got into this mess and an assurance that there
will be no cut back in patient care to avoid financial difficulties next
year.''

STRATHCLYDE Police yesterday announced the completion of a recruitment
drive bringing the force up to full strength for the first time in its
19-year history.
However, Chief Constable Leslie Sharp said that he planned to lobby
for more than 400 additional staff to reflect the police service's
changing workload.
Mr Sharp also revealed his intention to adopt a high-profile approach
to drugs-related crime typified by current campaigns such as Operation
Turnkey dealing with house-breaking, and Operation Blade tackling knife
crime.
Thirty recruits yesterday began their two-year training period,
bringing Strathclyde Police's strength to the authorised level of just
under 7000 officers.
This level was set on the force's formation in 1975, but changing
crime patterns and new demands on the police, Mr Sharp said, meant that
another 258 officers and 180 civilian staff would be required to allow
the force to perform at peak efficiency.
He said that he intended to lobby both Strathclyde Regional Council
and the region's successors under local government reorganisation for
the financial backing required.
Under the shake-up of local government, control of Strathclyde Police
will pass to a joint board of local authorities following the region's
demise next year.
Mr Sharp said that he would be putting forward a specially designed
financial package for approval which would allow recruitment of extra
staff from savings made as a result of recent internal reforms.
''In the last three and a half years, we have released over 500
officers from office jobs through the civilianisation programme, and
that means more police out on the beat.
''We will be continuing that policy of introducing civilians to the
force,'' declared Mr Sharp.
He was confident of getting the go-ahead for recruiting the extra
staff within the next 18 months.
Although the latest figures show a downturn in the incidence of
reported crime, Mr Sharp argued that a further increase in staffing
would allow further high-profile campaigns to be carried out.
The problem of drugs in Strathclyde would be the subject of a spring
campaign, details of which are still to be finalised.
The operation -- a name for which is still to be decided -- will focus
on drug-related crime and will feature an educational initiative warning
of the perils of involvement with heroin, ecstasy, and other drugs.
Strathclyde Police will be contacting drugs counsellors, medical
advisers, and other interested parties for discussions on the best way
to frame the campaign.
''I would envisage that we could play a vital role in co-ordinating
the response to the drugs problem in our area,'' Mr Sharp added.
That drugs problem went beyond last year's record number of
drugs-related deaths, and was a cause of concern for society, he added.
Ninety-five people in the force's area died through drugs last year.
Councillor Jim Jennings, chair of Strathclyde region's police and fire
committee, said the council was keen to back Strathclyde Police, but was
constrained by budget restrictions imposed by the Scottish Office.

GREEN protesters, camped in the path of the M77 motorway development,
yesterday prepared for a showdown with Wimpey Construction that never
came.
The direct action group Earth First! had rallied about 150 people at
its Pollok Estate encampment to mount a day of action against the firm
which is contracted to build the #53.6m link between the M77 at Haggs
Castle roundabout and the A77 at Malletsheugh.
Yesterday was the first day of the contract, and campaigners had
expected Wimpey surveyors to attempt to enter the site.
Elaborate preparations were taken to block access to the site, with
look-outs posted along the road's proposed route to alert the mass of
protesters assembled in the camp to any attempted incursion into what
they have claimed is their own independent ''Pollok Free State''.
All of the preparations were in vain, as Wimpey officials announced
none of their staff would go near the site.
That left campaigners claiming first blood in their battle to stop the
project.
A spokeswoman said: ''The company told us they were starting work
today. We got ready, they've backed down, so we're calling this a day of
celebration instead.''
Veterans of English road protests at Twyford Down and East Wanstead
had travelled north for yesterday's expected confrontation, and found
themselves dancing to rave music rather than stopping surveyors.
Scottish Militant Labour councillor, Mr Nicky Bennett, admitted that
the non-appearance of Wimpey personnel had engendered a general sense of
anti-climax.
Mr Bennett, who represents the South Nitshill ward on Glasgow District
Council, said the delay had given campaigners, drenched after a day's
rain, additional time to construct defences around their Pollok Estate
camp.
These new defences involved the building of a log and tyre barrier
blocking access to the site and the construction of two giant tripods
out of dead wood, as well as the further use of the controversial tactic
of tree-spiking.
The tripods, which were first used in North American protests against
logging firms, are intended to delay heavy plant equipment getting on to
the site, said camp member Colin MacLeod.
''The tripods have a cage at the top in which somebody sits, and
basically the company can't move them without risking that person's
safety,'' he added.
A Wimpey Construction spokesman said the firm had no plans to visit
the site yet.
''There's no need for any of our staff to be present at this early
stage of the contract,'' he said.
''We are still finalising the design of the extension and it will be
several weeks before we need to move any heavy equipment into
position.''

LEADING Tory Euro-sceptic Lord Tebbit last night launched a fresh
attack on the approach being taken by the Government to its policy on
Europe.
Despite the Prime Minister's insistence in a weekend interview that he
was determined to fight Britain's corner, Lord Tebbit continued to argue
that far too much power was being given over to Europe at the expense of
the British Parliament.
He said there appeared to be an unusual dictum that, if the Prime
Minister ''undertook an agreement with foreigners'', it was absolutely
binding on Parliament. That appeared to be a different undertaking to
that given during the election campaign to the voters of the country.
To illustrate his point, he referred to the recent protests over the
export of live animals to Europe, stating: ''There is deep puzzlement
among the British people as to why the Government does nothing about
this trade. We know why the Government does nothing. It does not have
the power to act.''
It was ''important to understand that the Prime Minister cannot
conceivably be the principle in negotiation with other powers''. He
could only be an agent because ''the power to make agreements, the power
to tax, must surely reside in Parliament''.
Lord Tebbit's remarks came in a Lords debate on the European
Communities Finance Bill, the issue which split the Tories when it was
considered in the Commons.
Mr Major made the Bill's second reading in the Commons an issue of
confidence, which led to eight Tory MPs being stripped of the party whip
after they refused to support the measure. A ninth, Sir Richard Body,
voluntarily resigned the whip in disgust over the Government's tactics.
In the Lords, Lord Tebbit said that, if he had still been in the
Commons, he would have found it ''difficult'' to support the Bill. He
deplored the opening remarks by Foreign Office Minister of State
Baroness Chalker, who said that, while Britain's contributions to Europe
would rise under the Bill by #250m, this was much less than the European
Commission had wanted.
She hailed the deal, hammered out at the Edinburgh summit, as ''good
for Britain'' and said the fight against fraud would continue to be a
top priority.
''For the Government, it is a matter of serious importance to deliver
our commitment given at Edinburgh. The UK's international reputation
would be severely damaged if we broke our word and our effectiveness in
future negotiations would be substantially undermined.''
For Labour, Opposition leader Lord Richard said the Government had
managed to get itself into an ''extraordinary political tangle''. He
told the House: ''By depriving eight Conservatives of the whip and
destroying his parliamentary majority, the Prime Minister has created a
group of dissidents within the Conservative Party who have to be
placated if the Government is to survive.''
The Oppposition would not oppose the Bill because it was necessary but
the Government could and should have done more about reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy and the fight against fraud.
For the Liberal Democrats, Lord Thomson of Monifieth warned against
too much self-righteousness over fraud, as if it was a European problem
only. Fraud and waste existed in UK institutions too, he said.

'VAT on private fees.' 'End charitable status.' 'Abolish private
schools . . .'
IT IS hard to believe that these were the headlines in the newspapers
on the first day of 1995. Is this to be the tenor of Labour Party policy
for the future? If these are the Labour Party's priorities, what hope is
there that the many desperate problems that need to be tackled in
education today will be dealt with by a future Labour Government?
Whom did the Labour Party consult on these policies? As the first week
of the year progressed, the story unravelled and the confusion deepened.
It seems that VAT on school fees is now ruled out, that proposals to end
charitable status are still under consideration, and that the abolition
of private schools is not on the agenda, at least not explicitly so.
One group whom the Labour Party did not consult was the independent
schools themselves, an omission that the Scottish Council of Independent
Schools would like to see corrected. Would the Shadow Secretary of State
be willing to meet the council and discuss his party's policies, as his
predecessors have done in the past? Did MPs with independent schools in
their constituencies consult their constituents? There are more than
31,000 children at independent schools in Scotland, whose eduction could
be seriously disrupted by taxation on school fees. Have MPs stopped to
ask parents how they feel and why they choose to educate their children
at an independent school?
Although independent schools will have been alarmed by the headlines
on New Year's Day, they will not have been surprised. The proposal to
introduce VAT on school fees was mooted several years ago and was, or so
we thought, rejected at the time. Politicians were advised that the
imposition of VAT was likely to breach the European Convention on Human
Rights by which the United Kingdom is bound by international law. It
would also be likely to breach the provisions of European Community law
which have direct effect in the United Kingdom. Similarly it was
considered that the removal of charitable status would breach the
European Convention on Human Rights.
Education has been considered charitable for hundreds of years. There
are countless legal opinions on charitable status, on the complexities
of removing charitable status from a group, and on the maze of
technicalities involved. The position has been studied by the Commission
on Social Justice and by many leading legal and political experts.
No-one knows better than the Labour Party how difficult it is to
unravel.
And why should it be unravelled? Surely education is a valid purpose
for charitable status? Most of the independent schools were founded as
charities, some 300 years ago, others in the mid-nineteenth century and
others more recently. All have worthy charitable foundations which the
present Trustees are working hard to uphold.
Why then charge fees? The fact is that education cannot be free,
whether it is provided by the state or by an independent organisation.
The Scottish Office Education Department has just published a report on
costs in Scottish schools for 1994/95. This shows that large secondary
schools have budgeted running costs in the range of #2000 to #3000 per
pupil, although that cost rises as the pupil roll becomes smaller. The
fact that parents with children at education authority schools do not
pay fees does not mean that their children's education is free. It is
paid for through the council tax, as we all well know.
The parents of the 31,000 children in independent schools in Scotland
pay their full share of the budget for state education through the same
tax. The fact that they do not choose an education authority school
means in effect that they are also saving the Government the cost of
educating 31,000 children.
The cost to the Government of charitable status to independent schools
is difficult to assess but, in the context of the overall costs of
education, it is minimal. In a UK survey it was shown that independent
schools gave away 34% more than they gained from charitable status. The
help given through bursaries, grants, academic, music and art
scholarships, travel grants and grants for higher education exceeded
concessions through charitable status.
In Scotland, more than 25% of children in independent schools will be
assisted with the cost of school fees, a cost which varies little from
the costs in education authority schools when capital and other expenses
are included.
Parents confirm time and again that they are willing to make
sacrifices for their chidren's education. This is not a political
decision, but a decision based on much soul-searching, on a quest for
good value and high quality. Nor are those who run the schools there for
political reasons. Heads and teachers in independent schools are first
and foremost educationists; some will have had experience in the State
sector and some will go on to have such experience. All are committed to
giving the best they can, academically and otherwise, to those in their
care.
A final point -- in Scotland we talk about independent rather than
private schools; yes, they are private in that they are apart from the
State and separately funded; they are not private in that they are open
to the public and fully accountable, as are all charities in Scotland.
Every day parents seek information about independent schools and there
is little doubt in their minds, or in ours, that these schools make a
vital contribution to education in Scotland.

MORE than half of Labour's 62 Euro-MPs have joined the growing
rebellion against leader Tony Blair's plans to rewrite Clause Four of
the party's constitution.
They placed a front-page advertisement in today's Guardian attacking
any revision of the 56 words which have been the party's guiding
principle since 1918, committing Labour to ''common ownership of the
means of production, distribution and exchange''. Among the signatories
are Strathclyde West's Hugh McMahon and Alex Smith, of South of
Scotland.
The move, adding to the pressure on Mr Blair over his radical bid to
modernise the party, comes on the day he makes his European debut in
Brussels as party leader.
A total of 32 MEPs have signed a statement demanding the retention of
Clause Four.
Alex Falconer, MEP for Mid Scotland and Fife, said: ''Just over half
of the British Labour MEPs are behind this advertisement, but many more
are unhappy with the way this whole thing has been handled over Clause
Four.''
He went on: ''With Britain and the rest of the world in crisis, this
is no time to jettison this powerful weapon for social and economic
justice.
''We oppose privatisation and believe that common ownership should
remain part of Labour's core beliefs and values. That is why we have
called for the retention of Clause Four part four in its present form,
and for a separate statement to express the party's aims today.''
The appearance of the advertisement will mar Mr Blair's emergence on
the European stage at a #500-a-head dinner in Brussels being hosted by
Labour and attended by senior executives from nearly 100 leading
companies, including Marks and Spencer, NatWest Bank, Coca Cola and
Hanson.
Mr Blair will join them after a half-day conference designed to
''establish close working links and a constructive dialogue between
business and the Labour party at a European level'' according to Wayne
David, leader of Labour's Euro-MPs.
At the same time, former Labour leader Neil Kinnock will be
establishing his credentials in Brussels as a new Euro Commissioner.
It is his turn tomorrow to be grilled by MEPs who are vetting all
incoming Commissioners before they take up their #130,000-a-year posts
later this month.
Meanwhile, at Labour's business conference, any profits made will go
to the party's fighting fund for the next general election.
Mr David said the topics on tomorrow's agenda will include economic
policy, environment and consumer protection, social affairs and trade.
''This event will show Labour working in the heart of Europe,'' he
said.
Mr David was not asked to join the Euro-Labour revolt against Clause
Four, to avoid compromising the group leader in Europe.
The full list of signatories is:
Richard Balfe (London South Inner); David Bowe (Cleveland and
Richmond); Roger Barton (Sheffield); Ken Coates (North Nottingham and
Chesterfield); Peter Crampton (Humberside); Alan Donnelly (Tyne and
Wear); Mike Elliott (London West); Robert Evans (London North West);
Alex Falconer; David Hallam (Hereford and Shrophire); Mike Hindley
(Lancashire South);
Stephen Hughes (Durham and Blaydon); Hugh Kerr (Essex West and
Hertfordshire East); Alf Lomas (London North East); Mike McGowan
(Leeds); Hugh McMahon; Eryl McNally (Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes);
Tom Megahy (Yorkshire South West); David Morris (South Wales West);
Clive Needle (Norfolk); Stan Newens (London Central); Eddy Newman
(Greater Manchester Central); Chris Oddy (Coventry and North
Warwickshire); Barry Seal (Yorkshire West); Alex Smith;
Shaun Spiers (London South East); Ken Stewart (Merseyside West): David
Thomas (Suffolk and South-west Norfolk); Sue Waddington (Leicester);
Norman West (Yorkshire South); Ian White (Bristol); Joe Wilson (North
Wales).
Shadow foreign secretary Robin Cook said that the move by the MEPs was
''very unfortunate'' and out of step with opinion in the party at large.
''What we have started here is a process of debate,'' he said on
Channel 4 News.
''I think it is very unfortunate that some people are wishing to
suggest that there should not be a debate on what replaces Clause 4,
that the party should simply dig in behind a text which is now over 80
years old.''

EVERY Wednesday 21-year-old Keiko Hashimura takes time off from her
studies at Tokyo's Waseda University to attend charm school. Instead of
listening to lectures on Japanese politics and economics Keiko receives
tuition on how to walk, talk, and dress properly.
On Saturdays Keiko visits one of Tokyo's growing number of career
advice centres which offer information about the sort of jobs which are
available for job-seeking students.
In return for a fee of #45 Keiko can use one of the centre's
sophisticated computers to find out more about her strengths and talents
and to obtain a list of jobs in which she might be interested.
Keiko, like hundreds of thousands of other senior students in Japan,
is desperate to find a job. The country's worst recession since the war
has forced Japanese companies drastically to reduce the number of people
they recruit.
The combined cost of attending charm school and the career advice
centre will probably amount to about #2000. But the investment, Keiko
reckons, is a sound one and will, she says, increase her chances of
securing a well-paid, high-status job with one of Japan's leading
companies.
''Charm school lessons will help me present a better image at the
crucial preliminary meetings and interviews which are arranged between
employers and students. With so much competition for jobs the appearance
and demeanour of applicants can make a big difference.''
Some students are prepared to go even further in their attempts to
secure the jobs they want. Cosmetic surgeries which offer to reshape
noses and eyelids have long waiting lists of students who want to
acquire ''more striking and intelligent looks'' before taking part in
the meetings and interviews which make up Japan's graduate recruiting
season.
The difficult job market has also encouraged universities to begin
their ''job-search'' programmes earlier than usual. On some campuses
students are attending job seminars and career counselling sessions 18
months or more before their graduation dates.
Private colleges, whose reputations are largely determined by the
number of jobs their students are able to secure with top employers, are
particularly keen to help their students find jobs.
The Government, meanwhile, is organising a series of job forums to
give senior students and unemployed graduates greater access to
recruiting companies. The first job will be held later this year.
The Japanese Government is also preparing to subsidise short-term,
on-the-job training programmes which it hopes will encourage companies
to hire more graduates.
Hundreds of companies have already announced that they plan to reduce
the number of new employees they will be taking on in time for the start
of the new working year in April. Some companies, such as the Mazda
Motor Corporation, have indicated that they will not be hiring any new
graduates at all.
Senior students at the country's lowest ranked universities face the
greatest difficulties in finding jobs. Indeed some companies now do not
even bother to respond to requests for corporate profiles from
undergraduates at lower ranked universities.
Students graduating with degrees in the social sciences are finding it
harder to secure jobs than graduates with science and engineering
qualifications or graduates with specialised diplomas in business or
administration.
But it is female graduates, who were allocated a record number of
career-orientated posts during the second half of the 1980s, who are
facing the biggest decline in job-offers.
Many companies are now less willing to train 23-year-old women who,
they claim, are too prone to abandoning their careers for the sake of
marriage and a life in the home.
Sex discrimination in the job market resulted, last year, in a
demonstration of students in central Tokyo. ''We want to work too'', the
women students shouted during their march through the business district.
The effects of the recession have been exacerbated by the large number
of people in their early twenties.
The pressure on jobs caused by the large number of sons and daughters
of the post-war baby boom generation is expected to last until 1996 when
the number of so-called 'baby boomers' begins to decline.
In the meantime, students can only remember with envy the very
different job position which existed during the 1980s. Even in 1990 the
country's 'bubble economy' had created a national labour shortage which
was encouraging employers to go to considerable lengths to secure the
services of the graduates they required.
Job-seeking students were inundated with glossy brochures, promotional
videos, free rail tickets and even the offer of familiarisation courses
on board luxury cruise ships and at fashionable resorts.
One company even bought a fleet of expensive sports cars for new
employees to borrow as part of its attempt to attract the attention of
job-seeking students.

<HEADLINE>Blair calls on support from dissidents to humble Tories</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980435162</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday outlined his party's plans to
inflict further defeats on the Government by mobilising public support
against highly unpopular policies such as rail privatisation -- and
appealing to dissident Tory MPs to join him.
Setting out his agenda for the next session of Parliament and beyond,
Mr Blair said his party would use its ''new-found strength and cohesion
in Parliament'' to fight the Government -- and opposing the
implementation of railway privatisation would be a top priority.
''We will shame the Government into responding to the country's
outrage,'' he declared.
However, he conceded that Labour would need to rely on rebel Tories to
defeat Government plans.
''It is in the nature of the game, I am afraid, that we have to rely
on a certain amount of Tory dissidents to win a parliamentary battle. I
think they are there potentially,'' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at
One.
Mr Blair told a Westminster news conference his other priorities would
be fighting pay and perks excesses by the privatised utilities, and
halting Tory plans to cut mortgage help for the unemployed.
He cited the fact that the Government always spent the proceeds of
privatisations when refusing to commit Labour to taking railways or the
water industry back into public ownership.
Describing his approach as one of ''sensible and understandable
caution'', he declared: ''I am not about to start spraying around
commitments.
''I am not going to get into the situation where I am declaring that
the Labour government is going to commit sums of money to
renationalisation several years down the line. It is not sensible
politics.''
In a clear appeal to middle class concerns over education --
heightened by Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett's pledge,
subsequently withdrawn, over VAT on school fees -- Mr Blair insisted he
was not interested in waging war on private education, but in raising
standards in the state system.
However, Tory chairman Jeremy Hanley accused Mr Blair of negative
soundbite politics, and reiterated that Tory tax cuts were not too far
away.
''Tony Blair just latches on to certain grievances and is making a
whole agenda for the coming year based on three issues, which neglects
the most important issue, the economy.
''He talks about our 'absurd plans' (on privatising railways), but he
refuses to answer whether he would renationalise the railways,'' Mr
Hanley told BBC Radio 5 Live.
He said: ''As the economy gets stronger and stronger and stronger,
people who have given us those extra taxes will get their money back.
That is what the Prime Minister has made clear.''
But Mr Blair, lambasting the ''weak and directionless Government'',
said middle-income Britain was ''deeply insecure'', and Labour was the
party of the majority.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said the only beneficiaries of Tory tax
rises were those who had been earning #64,000 or more a year.
He also urged a new Banking Act, saying bank profits were #7000m last
year, likely to be #10bn this year, and may rise yet again to #12bn next
year.
Mr Blair's bid to put his party on a firm campaign footing came after
the Prime Minister sought at the weekend to heal the rift within the
Tory Party by promising to veto any significant change to the British
constitution at the inter-governmental conference next year on the
future in Europe.
The Tory high command is still reeling from its humiliating defeat
over VAT on fuel last month, as well as opinion polls showing it to be
the most unpopular government in the history of polling in Britain.
Mr Blair pledged: ''The Government can expect no let-up in our
opposition to it, and in continuing to expose its weaknesses and
failings.''
But, running the gauntlet of left-wing wrath over his pledge to
rewrite Labour's Clause Four commitment to nationalisation, he expressed
confidence that the Labour Party would agree a statement of aims and
objectives which reaffirmed its commitment to socialist values.

PLANNED benefit cuts worth #4000m a year will open up a yawning gap
between Conservative spending and Labour proposals by the end of the
century, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley said yesterday,
signalling a further onslaught on the benefits system.
His uncompromising defence of further cuts, coupled with a prediction
that the parties' respective annual social security budgets would differ
by #11bn by the year 2000, marked a new stage in the attempt by the
right of the Cabinet to reclaim Thatcherite ground on public spending.
Mr Lilley flagged up three new measures which could be used to cut
spending further:
* Local pilot schemes to try out cuts and changes on an experimental
basis.
* Greater local discretion in the benefits system.
* Self-financing ways of reducing demand for benefits by spending
elsewhere.
But Labour last night condemned his proposals. The Shadow Social
Security Secretary, Mr Donald Dewar, described them as a ''return to the
Poor Law revived to excite his natural constituency on the hard right of
the Tory Party''.
Last week, two of Mr Lilley's fellow right wingers in the Cabinet,
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo and Welsh Secretary John Redwood,
made robust calls for tighter control on the public purse.
Mr Redwood said current public spending was ''at the limit of what the
nation was prepared to pay,'' while Mr Portillo was scathing about the
''vanities'' of public administration and demanded a further substantial
reduction in the role of the state.
This attempt to set a new right agenda for the year ahead was
confirmed yesterday with Mr Lilley's speech to the Social Market
Foundation, a Conservative think-tank.
Since 18 months ago, he claimed, new projections on unemployment and
other factors suggested that #8000m less would be spent on benefits in
the year 2000 than at first thought. ''Over half the savings, #4000m a
year, come from policy changes, even after taking account of higher
spending on work incentives and help with fuel costs,'' he said.
He claimed the report by the Social Justice Commission revealed ''how
little, except in rhetoric, the New Labour differs from the spendthrift
Old Labour.'' The commission's proposals had been costed as adding
#7000m to the budget, to be funded by tax increases, compared to his
planned savings of #4000m.
''Until Tony Blair is prepared to repudiate the Social Justice
Commission's #7000m spending programme and endorse our #4000m reforms,
the public will see an #11bn gap between the parties on social security
alone.''
Mr Dewar said Mr Lilley appeared to be advocating the break-up of the
benefit system and a patchwork of different local levels of Income
Support.
He asked: ''Does the Secretary of State think that the Income Support
level is too generous at least for industrial Britain?
''Has he forgotten that a husband and wife with two children have to
live on about #117 a week and that there are over 10 million people in
that position in his Tory Britain? Is he really saying there is room
here for cost-cutting?''
Mr Dewar said Mr Lilley's figures proved Labour's point about the
disastrous impact of high unemployment on the DSS budget and of planned
savings, adding: ''These are not painless. You cannot take #1500m from
the budget for the long-term sick and disabled without hitting many
vulnerable people hard.
''Mortgage interest restrictions leading to homelessness and
repossessions, the Jobseekers' Allowance, the assault on the basic
retirement pension are all socially damaging. Mr Lilley is interested in
costs but quick to forget that the causes of present problems lie in the
mismanagement of the economy.''
However, Mr Lilley insisted that Labour now was on the defensive over
social security reform, claiming: ''A broad cross-section of the
political spectrum now accepts that high spending is not a panacea but a
problem.
''The debate has focused on four main points: the costs of the current
system; concerns about welfare dependency; the need to restore
incentives and focus help where it is most required; and the beneficial
potential of private provision.''

Islamabad
BRITAIN was not taking sides in the dispute over Kashmir between
Pakistan and India, Foreign Secretary Mr Douglas Hurd insisted last
night after a two-day visit to Pakistan.
The dispute would not be solved by historians or lawyers but by
looking at reality and moving forward, he said.
Mr Hurd was reacting at a news conference to accusations in the
Pakistani press that his stand on the issue had damaged Islamabad's
position on Kashmir.
The all-party conference had rejected elections in Kashmir which the
Indian Government plans to hold in a few months' time, yet he seemed to
support them, Mr Hurd was told.
Mr Hurd said there were no specific arrangements or proposals for the
elections. However if they were to be credible, candidates needed to be
assured that the polls would be free and fair and that, if elected, they
would have a worthwhile role.
''I am quite clear it would be an advance on the present situation if
there could be Kashmiris elected by fellow Kashmiris who could properly
be regarded as representatives of all opinions,'' he said. ''There is a
long way to go.''
He repeated the three steps Britain regards as fundamental to any
solution: talks between India and Pakistan, free elections, and an end
to violence and interference from outside.
He said that human rights must be respected, including by the Indian
security forces, and outsiders should have access to what was going on.
If foreign observers were needed, Britain was in favour in principle of
providing some.
Mr Hurd's talks here and in New Delhi have left the Foreign Secretary
in no hopeful mood that this 40-year-old dispute is any nearer to a
solution. Equally he does not share the Armageddon theory and the
British view is that neither government wants a war.
Their mutual suspicion, however, has meant that in neither country did
he make any progress in persuading them to sign the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Accused of taking sides with India, Mr Hurd denied this. He said that
when he was in India, he was told that Britain was siding with Pakistan:
''We are not taking sides on this,'' he said.
''We wish to see progress in the dispute because the situation in
Kashmir is not satisfactory for anyone, not for the Pakistan Government,
not for the Indian Government, and certainly not for the people who live
in the region.''
Of his first visit to all three countries of the subcontinent, he said
it had been of ''substantial value''. Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan
were three countries with which Britain has had a strong relationship
based on history.
British trade and investment with all three countries had been
improving faster than anyone had anticipated two years ago.
He cited Bangladesh, which used to be regarded as a desperate case,
saying that it was now setting about its economic problems in a way
which, despite the problem of political stability, gave hope of
better-than-expected economic progress.
He was also keen that Britain should use its best assets -- the
English language, the professionalism of its public services, education
system, and success in the financial sector -- ''to put a traditional
friendship on a modern basis''.
Mr Hurd arrives home today after his eight-day tour.

Toulouse, Monday
AIRBUS Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, said that sales
last year were down slightly but it placed orders for 125 commercial
jets, beating arch-rival Boeing.
Deliveries lagged well behind, however, with Airbus delivering 123
aircraft to 35 customers, fewer than the 130 forecast at the beginning
of last year. This was blamed on a delay in the A330 version with Pratt
and Whitney engines.
Boeing reported last week that it delivered 270 commercial aircraft to
customers in 1994, its lowest annual total since 1987.
Airbus, which includes British Aerospace, is believed to have about
35% of the world commercial jetliner market, with Boeing about 60% and
McDonnell Douglas 5%. Its turnover was $8.5bn last year but does not
publish net earnings.
It also emerged today that West European airlines carried 11.5% more
passengers in November than a year previously.
The Association of European Airlines also said freight traffic grew
14.9% over the same period. South Atlantic routes showed the strongest
increase with passenger traffic up 18.1%. Passenger numbers within
Europe grew 14.8%.
''These are encouraging results,'' said AEA secretary-general
Karl-Heinz Neumeister. ''Hopefully, these figures indicate that the
long-awaited recovery in business travel is really gathering pace.''
* The US aviation industry, reeling from seven commercial airline
accidents last year that claimed 264 lives, was urged by the Government
to try to reach a goal of ''zero accidents''.
Officials of airlines, unions, aircraft manufacturers, and other parts
of the industry gathered in Washington for a two-day session focusing on
the safety of America's skies.--AP/Reuter.

A DELEGATION from local authorities which have offshore fabrication
yards within their area will lobby the Government today for help in
achieving a ''level playing field'' for European competition.
Members will meet Mr Charles Wardle, Under Secretary of State for
Industry and Energy, to raise issues identified in a consultant's report
commissioned by a consortium of local authorities last year which,
although finding no evidence of illegal subsidies being paid as part of
state funding for European yards, found British yards were not able to
compete equally in this highly competitive market.
Big differences in state aid identified in the report include the
Italian Government taking over responsibility for paying employees'
wages at a yard when it is without work.
Although it has never been offered in the UK, such assistance has
normally been part of regional development and is perfectly legal under
European Union regulations.
Issues to be be raised today include the favouring of domestic
suppliers by foreign operators in the rest of Europe; the competitive
disadvantage UK yards face in terms of significant finance available in
other European nations from their governments; concern over the UK's
present capability to diversify into construction of floating production
vessels; and the level of subsidy available under current legislation
for such floaters in contrast to platform and related systems throughout
the EU.

AN item in the books page over the festive season sent my mind
scurrying back to 1963, the year of President Kennedy's assassination.
We all remember what we were doing when that sensation brought the world
to a standstill.
I had raised my head from the rather pretentious task of writing my
autobiography, a mixture of therapy and vanity which was soon put into
perspective by the momentous news from Dallas.
Whatever I thought I had to report at the age of 32 I cannot imagine,
but the task was completed and off went the manuscript to Hutchinson the
publishers in London. Now I've heard of people who paper their walls
with rejection slips and finally, miraculously, the book is accepted and
becomes a best seller.
There may well be resilient people who live to tell such fairy-tales
but I was not blessed with that kind of hide. Regarding one rejection as
a warning and two as confirmation of failure, I crumpled up the
thumbs-down note from Hutchinson and tucked the manuscript in a drawer.
A few years later I unearthed it by chance and wondered if it had had
a fair trial. So I slipped it away, this time to a Scottish publisher,
Paul Harris in Aberdeen, and dreaded the death knell of a second
refusal. When that arrived, I accepted the uselessness of my effort and
cast it aside without thought of ever seeing it again.
As the sixties became the seventies, however, I gained the confidence
of writing books about other people when, suddenly one day in 1980, I
came across the battered old manuscript which had existed for 17 years.
By now approaching 50 and with that broader experience behind me, I
wondered if I could possibly resurrect the old tale and enrich it with
the benefit of time.
When that resurrection was complete, I tempted fate by sending it back
to Hutchinson of London, the people who had seen it first. Whatever
else, I could hardly fault their consistency. Back came a rejection slip
in much the same terms as before.
Having reopened the subject, I decided to follow through the farce in
its entirety, giving it another try with Paul Harris, who had by now
moved from Aberdeen to Edinburgh. Mr Harris, on the other hand, showed a
willingness to change his mind and said he would publish the book. I was
overjoyed.
Titles have never been my strong point so I was indebted to that fine
writer, Don Whyte, whose autobiography, On the Lonely Shore, is a
masterpiece.
''What about A Grain of Truth?'' said Don. And so it was. Paul Harris
launched it on Guy Fawkes Day of 1981 and hoped it would not prove to be
a damp squib. In fact it was selling well in hardback when Harris struck
a crippling disaster.
A lorry moving his stock from Edinburgh to London was blown off the
road in a gale and copies of my book were found scattered in a ploughed
field. A Grain of Truth could more appropriately have been called Gone
With the Wind. My poor old book was destined for oblivion.
Some years later the television film of Webster's Roup was seen by Ian
Chapman, chairman of Collins the publishers, who was sufficiently moved
to insist that I write a book about my background. But that had already
been done in Scotland, even if it perished on the English border.
Chapman was not easily dissuaded. He would buy the ill-fated book for
his Fontana paperback company, on the understanding that I wrote a
second one on similar lines, first as a hardback for Collins. That would
be called Another Grain of Truth.
That was how I became a paperback writer, with two volumes which sold
separately into the 1990s. When Ian Chapman parted company with the new
Collins boss, Rupert Murdoch, my books ran out of print and the
publishing rights lapsed. Oblivion once more.
Then up piped two young chaps, Campbell Brown and Steven Wiggins, who
had formed their own B+W Publishing company in Edinburgh, with the idea
of putting the two titles under one paperback cover.
I warned them of one particular hazard when taking on a journalist's
book. It can be difficult to gain any mention in a newspaper when the
writer works for a rival! But they went ahead and, sure enough, in its
few months of existence, leading up to the Christmas market, not a
single review had appeared in any journal.
Even in this column, having written about publication day, I realised
I had not mentioned the title of the combined volume. So, apart from
chance encounters in the bookshop, how do people come to know these
things?
My main anxiety, however, was that the adventurous young publishers
should not lose money through taking on a rerun of my autobiography.
Well, that anxiety was eased by the item which caught my eye in the
festive books page.
For there, in the list of Scotland's Top Ten, was my Grains of Truth,
occupying the kind of position I didn't even dream about in those
rejection days of 30 years ago. In places like Waterstone's of Princes
Square, Glasgow, I'm told, it has been selling among the top five.
Doesn't life take some funny turns?

Harare, Monday
A COURT in Zimbabwe is expected to deliver verdict tomorrow or
Wednesday on a doctor of Scottish descent who is accused of killing five
patients through excessive doses of morphine and negligent
post-operative care.
Dr Richard Gladwell McGown, 58, has pleaded not guilty to five charges
of culpable homicide in a highly publicised case.
High Court Judge Paddington Garwe stopped reading his summary after
2[1/2] hours, saying he would continue tomorrow.
The charges against Dr McGown, a Scot born in India and educated in
Scotland, were first levelled in 1992 after a parliamentary committee
said he had killed some patients between 1986-92 while testing the
side-effects of spine-injected higher morphine doses on black women and
children.
The prosecution said it had no evidence that the doctor was
experimenting when the five patients, three blacks and two Zimbabweans
of Greek and Asian origin, died.
However it said it could prove that Dr McGown, who has been practising
in Zimbabwe since 1968, he used big morphine doses and was generally
negligent.
During a five-week trial that ended in August, Dr McGown became a
hated symbol for blacks who claim he experimented on patients on whom he
administered an advanced method of anaesthetic treatment.
The case has raised racial tensions in a nation that once prided
itself on good relations between its 100,000 whites and 10 million
blacks.--Reuter.

DEVALUATIONS are seldom the easy and abrupt operations they tend to
appear in retrospect. Mexico's devaluation of the peso late last year is
a case in point. It was abrupt enough but otherwise maladroitly handled
and ran the risk of precipitating a huge currency crisis with ever lower
values for pesos in world markets. That at least has been averted and no
great harm may have been done by a devaluation greater than originally
intended if it allows the economy to bounce up faster than it otherwise
might have done. There is no way of avoiding the pain the devaluation
will impose in lower real wages and the increased cost of imports, but
the help to exports and the spur to enhanced productivity are equally
identifiable.
That all sounds straightforward, but its reality may be felt
differently by the mass of Mexicans whose incomes will be badly
squeezed. A safe bet will be that the social unrest, evident in the
rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas, may spread, even if the
Government has so far won the support of organised labour. At least the
US and Canada, Mexico's partners in the North American free trade zone,
have begun to help to stabilise the peso, and the same outcome will
follow the Japanese loans and financial backing from Europe. If this
sort of help allows the Government to redeem its debt in (mainly
internationally held) bonds due this quarter, the worst could be over.
Mexico probably needs two years (the time lag before the positive
effects of a successful devaluation are beyond dispute). It will still
need the help and understanding of its trading partners and foreign
investors, and should get it. Like Brazil, it is a large developing
economy very close to self-sustaining growth. If it achieves the
breakthrough its problems will not disappear but can be confidently
addressed in the hope of a steady reduction. If it continues to teeter
on the edge it could just as easily lapse into hopeless poverty for
another generation. That thought alone should make the Americans
generous -- their south-western states would be the second victims of
any Mexican failure.

TENANTS of Scottish Homes in Cumnock and Doon Valley district have
voted overwhelmingly in favour of being allowed to choose the local
council as an alternative landlord.
The housing development agency, which is disposing of housing stock
inherited from the Scottish Special Housing Association, has refused to
bow to previous pressure to give tenants such an option except in
special circumstances.
Of those who replied to the questionnaire, 97.55% said they would like
to be able to choose the local authority as their future landlord. Only
1.65% said they would not.
A spokesman for the council yesterday condemned Scottish Homes's
position over who could be included on tenants' ballot papers as
''unfair and undemocratic'' and urged the agency to reconsider.
But Scottish Homes said the level of interest in transferring to the
council was not surprising as it had only published its strategy for
Ayrshire last August. A spokeman said: ''We feel tenants should have the
opportunity to explore other options. Transfer to housing associations
offers the chance to bring in private investment and earlier
improvements to housing.''

Zomba, Malawi, Monday
THOUSANDS of angry Malawians stoned police today outside a court where
former president Kamuzu Banda and a close political associate were
refused bail on murder charges.
Witnesses said about 3000 people pelted police with rocks outside the
court in Zomba. Police fired in the air to disperse the crowd.
Television cameraman Mark Chisholm was treated in hospital for a
broken finger after being struck by a rock but there no other reports of
casualties.
Magistrate Qoto Bitiku rejected a bail application by Banda, his aide
John Tembo, and two police officers charged with the 1983 murder of four
political opponents. Bitiku set January 18 as the trial date in the High
Court.
Tembo and the police officers attended the session in person but
Banda, who is in his 90s and believed to be senile, remained at home
under arrest.

MADRID: Syrian arms dealer Monzer Al Kassar yesterday went on trial
accused of supplying the weapons used in the 1985 hijacking of the
Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro.
Al Kassar denies supplying the Kalashnikov assault rifles used by
Palestinian guerrillas in the hijacking, in which one US passenger was
killed. He told the court today that a judge had asked him for $100m
(#66m) in exchange for his freedom.
Prosecutors are asking for a 29-year prison sentence if Al Kassar is
convicted. Al Kassar, who says he engages only in legal arms sales, has
consistently claimed he is the victim of a conspiracy to link him to the
hijacking.--Reuter.

Your report about the redevelopment of the former Lomond Castle Hotel
inferred that the Friends of Loch Lomond were critical of the proposal
(January 5).
The society's concerns about the pressures on Loch Lomond from
increasing numbers of high-speed power boats are well known.
However, the Friends did not oppose the proposaland, when consulted on
the application, expressed support for the sensitive rebuilding and
extension of this fire-damaged property.

The decision by the Receiver to sell the Health Care International
hospital in Clydebank to an Abu Dhabi consortium seems to have been
taken (January 4).
The price will be that of the bargain basement, probably about
one-fifth of the original cost, a goodly part of which was contributed
by British taxpayers from money allocated to the Secretary of State for
Scotland to be used for the benefit of Scotland.
This decision was justified by Tony Worthington, MP, on the basis that
the ''acute services strategy produced by Greater Glasgow Health Board
shows how impossible it would be to graft this hospital on to the NHS''
(January 4).
Why do not our local Labour MPs effectively challenge the GGHB on this
inflexible policy, a policy which will deny the people of Scotland an
up-to-date facility which is surely within their grasp? Instead, wealthy
people from the Middle East will enjoy this modern hospital while folks
around here have to accept less adequate hospital facilities.
Is this now official Labour Party policy? It would be appreciated if
Tony Worthington, or Sam Galbraith, or economist Alf Young would
explain, in some detail, why the policy now being followed is in the
best interest of our people.

John Linklater has had his bit of fun with the carve-up of phone books
(January 5). Has he considered that there may be a case for having no
telephone directories at all, except possibly for the Yellow Pages?
The Royal Mail does not publish a list of personal addresses but this
has not prevented people from corresponding with one another.
Of course the absence of a directory of residential telephone numbers
would be inconvenient for investigative reporters, telephone
salespeople, and the like, but would this matter?
The number of people who have gone ex-directory to avoid unwanted
calls is now, I believe, very substantial.

Washington, Monday
THE United States and Vietnam have edged a step closer to establishing
normal relations: they will open liaison offices in each other's
capitals by the end of the month.
The two countries agreed last year to settle the remaining questions
between them, and open the office by the end of 1994.
They will do it a month late, just short of 20 years after the last
American ambassador to South Vietnam escaped from the roof of his
embassy in a helicopter.
Exchanging ambassadors and resuming normal commercial relations will
take place later, but opening a formal American mission in Hanoi and a
Vietnamese one in Washington is a considerable step along the road.
The assistant secretary of state for east Asia, Winston Lord, said
that the two sides had resolved most problems and added: ''I would be
surprised if we didn't open up the liaison office for business in the
course of the month.''
Vietnam was taken off the list of countries under an American trade
embargo last February. Matters such as American property claims have
been settled, and the issue that has clouded relations since 1975, the
Americans still missing from the Vietnam war, is no longer a hindrance.
There are still a few deluded and fanatic believers that a number of
those missing are still being kept prisoner somewhere in Indo-China, but
the Government and Congress have formally concluded that there are none.
The hunt for bodies continues, and every so often a set of remains is
sent back to the United States for burial.
However the war is over, and the US and Vietnam both recognise it.

Am I the only Scot who feels insulted, rather than pleased or
concerned, over the Labour Party's proposal for a (so called) Scottish
assembly?
Regional assemblies are also being proposed for the North, the
Midlands, and the South of England -- as indeed the deputy leader, John
Prescott, emphasises every time the subject of the Scottish and Welsh
assemblies is raised.
The inference is that, in the eyes of the Labour Party, Scotland
should be viewed as just another region of the UK rather than be awarded
its true status as a nation in its own right.
The proposal for regional assemblies is a selfish attempt by Labour to
reach a Westminster majority by maintaining its strong Scottish
representation while conning the Scots and Welsh into believing they are
being offered some measure of real independence.
Labour intends exploiting the Celts' natural sense of patriotic pride.

We in the Scottish region should thank John Major for pointing out
that complete union with England (CUWE) is the perfect form of
government (PFOG). That CUWE is perfect is clear from Mr Major's
conclusion that not one dot or comma of our constitution needs to be
changed.
I am surprised no-one else has grasped Mr Major's grand strategy which
may yet confound his Euro-sceptic critics. The Westminster answer to the
West Lothian question is that the English Conservative Party (ECP) can
rule Scotland in perpetuity with as much as 25% of the popular vote.
This feature of the PFOG can surely be applied elsewhere.
For instance, how long before the Germans, having had the PFOG
explained to them, are clamouring for CUWE? It should only take a modest
amount of gerrymandering (in which the ECP is alleged to have some
expertise) to ensure that the ECP retains power at Westminster. Soon
France and other European countries would follow.
The benefits of the PFOG are potentially enormous. Federalism and
Brussels could drop from the political vocabulary. The dangerous
anti-democratic voting practices in Europe could be replaced by the
perfect first-past-the-post system.
Centralisation in London could oust centralisation in Brussels. Russia
could be drawn in, dragging with it the many smaller nations it has
crushed for so long. CUWE is perfect for that kind of problem.
It is now clear that all patriotic Scots should join in Mr Major's
vision thing and vote Tory at the next General Election. Since we have
the PFOG, why run the risk of substituting it with some form of
democracy?

I was depressed to read your correspondents' defence of Flower of
Scotland as an anthem (January 5).
The fact that the National Anthem is dreadful, with or without the
famed and now obsolete anti-Scot verse, is a spurious point, but the
fact that they mention it at all tells us much.
Must every facet of Scottish identity be a rebuff to the English? What
must the rest of Europe and the world think of this anthem? We're not
interested in the future progress or international standing of our
country, but let us instead tell you of the time long ago we gave the
English a good kicking.
The idea that because the English National Anthem is horrid to the
Scots then ours should be beastly back seems very childish to me. We
don't like the English much -- is that all the Scottish patriot has got
to sing about?
I don't think so. Rather than a pathetic slanging match harking back
to battles of ages past, would it not be better for each country to have
a more positive and forward looking anthem?

Bob Crampsey feels shamed because England's cricket team has been
thrashed by Australia, and asks, ''Why have we come to this pass?''
(December 30).
We? What is he talking about? Scotland has come to enough passes in
recent years, and not just in sport, to be going on with. We don't need
the extra burden of England's cricketing failures.
The demise of English cricket is in any case a matter for the English.
It is also a matter about which Scots are largely indifferent. Those
Scots who are cricket lovers, and I know a few, are just as likely to
feel good about Australia's performance as feel bad about England's.
Bob Crampsey is of course a unionist and as such has no difficulty in
suggesting that in cricket ''England'' equals ''Britain''. What
nonsense! What reason is there for Scots to accept that ''England''
should equal ''Britain'' in any sport, or indeed any other aspect of our
lives?
There are different nations in these islands, and people don't change
their national allegiance as if changing shirts.

FRIENDS of the Earth responded cautiously yesterday to questions about
what campaigns director Andrew Lees was doing in the jungles of
Madagascar before he was found dead at the weekend.
The environmental group insisted Mr Lees was on holiday, despite
reports that he was secretly investigating a mining project which may
threaten the forest.
Mr Lees' body was found on Saturday in dense undergrowth near Fort
Dauphin on the African island's south-west coast, near where he was last
seen on New Year's Eve.
Two doctors who examined him said his death appeared to have been
caused by a heart attack.
Newspapers say Mr Lees, 46, who had worked with FoE for nearly 20
years, was collecting evidence on the likely impact of a joint mineral
mining project between a Canadian subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc and the
Madagascan Government.
He and photographer Paul Hellyer flew to Madagascar to assess the
possible threat to the forest, which contains many unique species, it
was claimed.
However, FoE forest campaigner Tony Juniper insisted yesterday:
''Andrew was on his holidays.''
Nevertheless he added that, as a committed environmentalist, Mr Lees
would not have been blind to ''potential environmental abuse''.
''Anything he brought back would have been of great interest to us,''
said Mr Juniper.
Mr Lees had been in Madagascar since December 14 and was due to leave
the day after he decided to go into the forest to film.
His body is being flown back to the UK.
British ambassador Peter Smith said that Mr Lees had been slightly ill
for two days before heading off.
His fiancee, Dr Christine Orengo, who helped to co-ordinate the
search, is understood still to be on the island. She will shortly be
returning to Britain.
A spokeswoman for Rio Tinto Zinc said: ''We are obviously upset about
Mr Lees' death and are offering our condolences to Friends of the Earth
and his family.''
She confirmed that the subsidiary company, QIT, had been carrying out
environmental impact studies in the forest ahead of work starting on a
40-year project to mine mineral sands.
''We entirely understand that it is a unique and sensitive
environment, and there has to be a balance between the environmental
impact and benefits to the country,'' she said.
''Friends of the Earth have been in meetings where we have presented
the project over the last couple of years.''

It is, apparently, more expensive to travel from Edinburgh to Munich
on a direct flight than to fly via London.
Since the three cities (Edinburgh, London, and Munich) lie on a
near-perfect right-angled triangle this would appear to be a direct
contravention of the well-established rule that the fare on the
hypotenuse should not exceed the sum of the fares on the other two
sides.

DOCTORS have been told that some women who become infatuated with them
may use their children in order to get the attention they crave.
The warning is in the Journal of the Medical Defence Union, which had
to defend a consultant accused of indecent assault against the mother of
a boy and girl he had previously attended.
In both cases, the consultant had reservations about the genuineness
of their conditions. The boy had suffered abdominal pains and severe
discomfort and locking of his knee. He underwent an arthroscopy -- a
visual inspection using an endoscope passed through an incision in the
joint -- but the doctor had reservations about the genuineness of the
symptoms; he felt they were being produced to please the boy's mother.
His sister also suffered abdominal pains and underwent knee surgery.
''The consultant was greatly concerned about the family as a whole,''
says the report. ''He felt that the clinical scenarios -- changing
symptoms, multiple consultations and referrals, unnecessary operations
and investigations, some of which had been requested or suggested by the
mother, and concerns about her personal behaviour -- were a reflection
of Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy.''
The consultant referred the matter to the local social services
department, and court proceedings followed.
A few years later, the consultant heard from the General Medical
Council of an allegation by the mother that he had made improper
advances towards her and indecently assaulted her.
The case was dismissed by the GMC's preliminary proceedings committee
after the MDU had obtained an independent expert opinion on the matter.
The expert said there seemed to be grounds for believing that the
children were being pushed into abnormal illness behaviour.
''Another factor that needs to be taken into account is that many
mothers are causing false illness in their children in order to gain
attention for themselves.
''There is quite a large body of opinion to suggest that, in some
cases, the mother 'falls in love' with the doctor and abuses the child
in order to have more contact with the doctor.''
The expert added: ''I am not aware of any cases in which that love has
been reciprocated by the doctor in a physical manner, but clearly this
convoluted behaviour could well lead to false allegations.''
Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy is a psychiatric condition which has
led to video surveillance in some hospitals of mothers suspected of
smothering their infants.
It is also the disorder attributed to student nurse Beverley Allitt,
now serving life after killing four children and attacking nine others
in Grantham Hospital.

TWO brothers were yesterday ordered to be detained, one without limit
of time, after their plot to steal money ended in the ''callous'' murder
of a child carer.
The High Court in Glasgow was told that Brian Ferrie, then 15, struck
Mr George Campbell, 55, on the head with a hammer before stabbing him to
death in his Lanarkshire home.
The youth, now 16, who had been living in a children's home, admitted
assaulting Mr Campbell with intent to rob him and stabbing and murdering
him on September 19 last.
Lord Morison ordered him to be detained without limit of time at a
place to be decided by the Scottish Secretary.
The judge described it as a terrible crime and added that it was
difficult to see how any human being could take the life of another in
such a callous manner.
Martin Ferrie, 18, who had been living with Mr Campbell and his wife
Shirley, 55, a hospital matron, in their home at Johnston Farm House,
Johnstone Road, Gartcosh, had his plea of not guilty to murder accepted
by the Crown.
He admitted assaulting Mr Campbell with intent to rob him, and a
breach of the Bail Act.
He was ordered to be detained in a young offenders institution for a
total of six years and three months.
A third accused, Mr Hugh Brown, l8, was freed when his plea of not
guilty to the murder charge was accepted by the Crown.
Mr Andrew Lamb, prosecuting, told the court that although the brothers
had no previous convictions, both had been the subject of reports to the
Children's Panel -- in Martin Ferrie's case for housebreaking and
assault, and Brian in connection with housebreaking, wilful fire
raising, and assault.
The court was told that both accused had been placed in children's
homes, but at the time of the offence Martin Ferrie was being prepared
for life outside.
As part of this preparation he began making visits to the home of Mr
Campbell, then stayed overnight several times, and in August began
living there.
Mr Campbell cared for such children, and he and his wife formed a
close relationship with the youth.
On September l9, Mr Campbell, who was also a taxi driver, drove Martin
to Airdrie for a job interview.
Later, at his mother's house, Martin met his brother and they began
drinking and in the evening decided to go with another youth back to the
Campbell home.
Martin Ferrie said that Mr Campbell had #800 and they planned to steal
this. Outside the house Brian Ferrie picked up a hammer.
Mr Lamb said that Mr Campbell was in one room watching television and
his wife and a relative in another.
Martin Ferrie offered to make tea and coffee and then called his
brother to the kitchen to help serve it. He was unaware that while in
the kitchen his brother had picked up a bread knife.
After serving Mrs Campbell and her relative, Martin Ferrie saw his
brother and Mr Campbell struggling and left the house. Shortly
afterwards, Mrs Campbell saw her husband saturated in blood and called
an ambulance, but he died in hospital.
Mr Lamb said the deceased had cuts to his nose and chin and a stab
wound to his shoulder, but it was a wound to the chest which cut main
arteries and caused death. He said a post-mortem examination revealed
the knife had been pushed three times into the deceased's chest.
Next day, both brothers went to the police.

POLITICAL life in Britain is grievously polarised. How could it be
otherwise when a coarsely adversarial system, predominantly two-party
politics, and the decaying remnants of class-based thinking festoon the
structure? Because of this the reported comments of Michael Portillo,
John Redwood, and now Peter Lilley on the vexing issue of public and
welfare spending have resulted in predictably dismissive reactions. This
is wrong, not because these senior Conservative thinkers are correct in
their analysis, but because the issue they address is one of the
greatest facing this and future governments and is unlikely to be
satisfactorily resolved by any of them. Despite the difficulties, which
can at times appear overwhelming, a serious and prolonged debate on the
welfare state and the role and scope of public funding for it must be
undertaken. Inasmuch as they are thinking seriously about the subject,
the three Conservative Ministers are to be congratulated.
To say this is not to agree necessarily with their conclusions,
although the honesty of Mr Redwood (by far the most creative of the
three) is refreshing. He points out that public spending has risen and
continues to rise. As this is an implicit criticism of his own
Government he neglects to point out that public spending has actually
risen by 29% in real terms since the Tories came to power in 1979.
Naturally he deplores this, and suggests that government is already at
the limit of what the nation is prepared to pay. Mr Portillo's ineptly
argued speeches confirm the ideological thrust and Mr Lilley, with his
claim to have taken #8000m out of welfare spending, and his proposal
yesterday of further radical reform, confirms the certainty of
continuing cuts in welfare spending.
At one level the logic of Mr Lilley and his colleagues is
unassailable. The demands made on the welfare state as currently
constituted will continue to grow. Obviously there is a limit beyond
which the State can no longer fulfil these expectations. One of the
greatest fears we should have for our children is the prospect of them
joining a dwindling band of workers dedicated to the upkeep of a
swelling band of elderly and unemployed welfare recipients; the tax
regime necessary to accompany this scenario almost passes belief.
Accepting the principle of a welfare system which will support those who
need support without beggaring the State is at the core of most sensible
thinking, together with the need to adjust the provisions of welfare to
ensure that it is properly targeted. Yet these are merely words and
notions held in common by many. Making it all work is quite a different
matter, and in that respect Mr Lilley and company fail to impress. The
welfare system has been subjected already to significant reforms, but
although they may be responsible for half of that #8000m of reduced
spending, not all of them are even roughly fair. For the latest example
we need look no further than the plans to cut mortgage help for people
forced on to income support. Nor have welfare reforms prevented, far
less removed, deepening poverty or ensured reasonable access to
necessary aid for people who have no alternative source of support.
The problems over the system of welfare provision which will face the
new generation of politicians, Mr Blair and Mr Brown in the Labour Party
and Mr Lilley and his colleagues in the Conservatives, are daunting. The
reform of welfare is particularly difficult because helping the poor is
both expensive and difficult. It involves a complex blend of benefits
and taxation designed, in a manner which has hitherto baffled most
theorists, to avoid worsening the poverty trap. Better targeting of
support will help, together with sensible schemes to help people back
into work. Taxation of low earners should be minimal and others taken at
their word when they say they are prepared to pay higher tax for
services; reform should be seen to be manifestly just to all concerned.
Above all the challenge must be faced. That will be uncomfortable, but
necessary.

New York, Monday
THE Grand Mufti of Egypt, Dr Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, said today that
Salman Rushdie's controversial novel, The Satanic Verses, was ''a
collection of lies, insults, and vices''.
However he sidestepped the issue of the death sentence imposed on the
British Indian-born writer in 1989 by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah
Khomeini on grounds that the book blasphemed Islam.
Tantawi said on a visit to the United States: ''As mufti of Egypt, I
am opposed, I am opposed, I am opposed to killing. At the same time I am
opposed to lying, I am opposed to lying, I am opposed to lying.''
The mufti, appointed by the Egyptian Government, is the highest
Islamic authority in the country.
Speaking through an interpreter, Tantawi said the country where
Rushdie lived should select three religious scholars -- a Jew, a
Christian, and a Muslim -- to study his book, discuss it, and ask the
author the source of his insulting assertions regarding the Prophet
Muhammed and Islam.
''All objective laws specify a punishment for anyone who speaks lies
against others,'' said Tantawi. ''After the discussion of what Rushdie
has written, I will be satisfied with their judgment.''
He added: ''What Salman Rushdie has written is a collection of lies
and a collection of insults and vices which cannot be uttered by a
decent human being . . . My judgment, therefore, is that Salman Rushdie
is a religion-less person whose chief pursuit is the pursuit of
wealth.''

MORE than 500 parents last night came to the defence of a head teacher
who is appealing against a decision to remove him from his post.
Strathclyde region has decided to remove Mr Gerry McKenna, head
teacher of St Columba's in Renfrew division, and transfer him to St
Andrew's Secondary in Glasgow, with conservation of salary, after he had
been given a final warning.
The region claims three instances of mismanagement by Mr McKenna.
The parents met last night to discuss the issue ahead of Mr McKenna's
appeal today. A resolution giving wholehearted support for Mr McKenna
was unanimously carried, as was a vote of confidence.
Support for Mr McKenna has also come from the school board chairman,
Mr Jim McAnally.
Mr McAnally, who is now self-employed after taking early retirement
from his post as maths adviser in Renfrew division, said: ''We felt that
the penalty was extremely severe and that the time-scale for
implementation was far too hasty.''
Mr McKenna was due to start his new job this week, but nothing will be
done until councillors on the Strathclyde appeals sub-committee decide
whether to reject or uphold his appeal.
Mr Jim Crawford, chairman of the Parent Teachers Association, said
some parents had voiced their intention at last night's meeting to
withdraw pupils from the school, while others had threatened to boycott
St Columba's until the decision to remove Mr McKenna was rescinded.
However, he urged parents not to take these steps at this stage.
Support for Mr McKenna was also forthcoming at last night's meeting
from Mr Tommy Graham, Labour MP for Renfrew West and Inverclyde, and Mr
John McFall, Labour MP for Dumbarton, in whose constituency Mr McKenna
lives.
Mr Graham said the turnout demonstrated the strength of support for Mr
McKenna from parents, staff, and the school board.
He added that he was appalled at what he claimed was a lack of
consultation afforded by the education officials to the parental
organisations within St Columba's.
Mr McFall, who taught alongside Mr McKenna more than 20 years ago,
said: ''I want justice to prevail, and that justice is Gerry McKenna
remaining as head teacher at St Columba's.''
When news of Mr McKenna's removal first emerged, the school board had
asked parents to return forms it had sent to pupils' homes asking if
they wanted a stay of execution. Mr McAnally said there had been a 70%
return.
He said disciplinary action was taken after Strathclyde's school's
inspectorate, the quality assurance unit, visited the school and made 10
recommendations, three of which had not been implemented when inspectors
made a follow-up visit.
Inspectors were extremely critical, but the board chairman said Mr
McKenna had done a good job, given staffing difficulties at the time.
The second instance related to a failure to meet the deadline to send
50% of pupil university application forms to the clearing body, Ucas.
The third related to a visit to the school by independent auditors who
examined the school books. They could not account for a sum of money,
although there has been no question of criminal activity.

Boston, Monday
A CALL by a Roman Catholic cardinal for a halt to protests at abortion
clinics has fallen on deaf ears and led to a split in the ranks of
Catholic bishops.
Nearly two weeks after the murder of two women receptionists at
Boston-area clinics, only two bishops have joined Boston's Cardinal
Bernard Law's bid to replace vigils at clinics with special church
prayer services.
The National Conference of Catholic Bishops said today it would not
take a stand on Law's move designed to lower the heat of a feverish
debate and will leave it up to individual bishops.
Ten days ago a lone gunman killed two receptionists at clinics in
Brookline, Massachusetts, and wounded five others. Three other people
were killed at abortion clinics in 1994.
The alleged gunman in the Brookline attack, John Salvi, 22, pleaded
not guilty today to two charges of first-degree murder and five
attempted murder counts stemming from the shootings in the Boston area.
His lawyer, J W Carney, said the central question at Salvi's trial
would not be what happened, but why. He described his client as ''a very
impressionable young man''.
New York City's outspoken Cardinal John O'Connor says he believes
protests at clinics, where Roman Catholics often say the rosary as
people enter and leave the building, should continue unless ''a
moratorium on abortions'' is called.--Reuter.

IN these dark, post-festive days, us Scots give thanks for any light
at the end of the tunnel to see us through from New Year to the Burns
Supper season.
But don't look for any such light at the CCA in Glasgow. The art
centre's programme for January is entitled Bad Times, based on the axiom
that ''where there is light there is always darkness, and art must
confront what is sad, harsh and painful''.
It kicks off with a cheery little exhibition under the name Suicide
Notes. This includes an ingenious montage of genuine suicide notes
donated by the Los Angeles police department, displayed attached to body
bags. As far as we know there are no corpses in the bags.
This is followed by a performance piece Die by Suicide by Michael
Mayhew, whose father, grandfather, and cousin committed suicide. And it
says in the promotional leaflet, tastefully illustrated with a Wilkinson
Sword razor blade: ''Gran is asking for a sharp knife.''
We move on joyfully to a series of shows under the umbrella title
Despair and a disucssion on ''Savage God -- Four Views of Suicide''. If
this doesn't make you want to jump into the Clyde there is a Valentine's
night special with ''cruel cocktails to weep into'' and songs from
Madeleine McDonald, ''the Diva of Despair''.
Slightly more cheerful by comparison are events called Four Scenes in
a Harsh Life -- ''ritualistic performances that revolve around images of
suffering, torture, healing, and transcendence'' -- or Hopeless, a set
of video pieces which ''set a tone of unsuppressed personal
melancholy''.
The CCA assures us that information will be available for anyone
attending the shows who might require self-help or counselling.
* Older readers might remember the CCA better as the Third Eye Centre
which the centre was in another life -- before it committed suicide.
Fishy business
LISTENERS to the Tom Morton Show yesterday on BBC Scotland steam radio
were treated to a cookery demonstration by award-winning chefette Anne
Nichol of the Dunain Park Hotel in Inverness. Her dish was a smart
little number of monkfish wrapped in bacon.
Can you not just hear the bacon sizzling across the airwaves? No
expense was spared, the BBC even buying in an electric frying pan for
the occasion.
Well, there was a bit of cheating. The chefette could not get any
monkfish and substituted haddock. And, do you know, none of the
listeners noticed. That's the wonder of cooking on the radio.
Next week Tom Morton has an item on synchronised group sex with a
display by the Portree Woman's Guild Gaelic Choir and the Skye Camanachd
shinty team squad. Honest.
Vodka and no ice
* WE read in a British Airways safety services magazine of the awesome
efficiency of Russian airport staff. A plane belonging to a US carrier
experienced a little local difficulty, in that ice had formed on the
wings.
The flight crew had no de-icing fluid. Neither did the airport ground
staff.
The Russians scrubbed the wings down with hot water and then sprayed
them with 25 bottles of vodka.
No ice, no problem, smooth take-off. We think Boris Yeltsin would
approve.
Hooked on sex
IT is not often the Diary ventures into the world of angling but we
were intrigued by the title of a book to be published this summer --
Sex, Death, and Fly-Fishing by John Gierach.
Tell us about the sex bit, we asked Flycatcher, the publishers. They
didn't know but said they would ask their American counterparts who
first brought out the book.
The answer came back: ''It's a very sexy book if you're a mosquito.''
This is entirely what you might expect of an elderly American hippie,
which is what Mr Gierach is, who majored in philosophy at college and
then spent years writing poetry before making a living penning
best-selling books on ''fly-fishing with philosophic overtones''.
Mr Gierach has become a cult writer about fly-fishing, especially
after adopting movie-style titles for his books. His last one was called
Dances with Trout.
He shuns publicity and would not have left his riverbank in Boulder,
Colorado, to be interviewed by the Diary. Which is just as well as we
would have run out of questions after the one about sex.
Flycatcher, the publisher, sent us a copy of Dances with Trout. It has
a chapter about salmon fishing in Scotland. Mr Gierach relates how one
of his angling companions sensibly gives up pursuing the elusive
Atlantic salmon in favour of trysts with the comely young Highland lass
who is doing the cooking up at the big house.
So there may be some sex in the new book after all.
PS. We have skipped through the rest of Dances with Trout and it
appears to be all about fishing. Anyone want a free copy?
The above extract is from the brochure for Living Well, a new sports
complex in Glasgow. We think we know what they mean.

SIX men were released on bail at Ayr Sheriff Court yesterday when they
appeared on charges of being involved in the supply of drugs at the
town's Hanger 13 nightspot.
Five of the accused -- Mr Gary Dunlop, 21, of Avils Hill; Mr Martin
Tricker, 20, of Coronation Road, Drongan; Mr Bryan McFarlane, 26, of
Backhawkhill Avenue, Ayr; Mr Michael Kenny, of Coyle Crescent,
Rankinston; and Mr Edward Fox, 21, of Ashgrove, Irvine, all Ayrshire,
each faced a single charge of being involved in the supply of ecstasy.
All but Mr Tricker were alleged to have committed the offence between
January and August last year. In Mr Tricker's case, the charge alleged
that the offence had continued into September.
The sixth accused, Mr Charles Partridge, of Lomond Place, Irvine,
faced a series of charges including being involved in the supply of
ecstasy, amphetamines, and cannabis, and being in possession of
cannabis.
None of the accused made any plea or declaration, and Sheriff Neil Gow
continued the cases against all six for further inquiries.
Last year, three men died after collapsing at Hanger 13. In November,
Kyle and Carrick district licence committee suspended the nightspot's
drinks licence. An appeal against the move will be heard shortly.

CHILDLINE Scotland, which provides counselling for children suffering
from abuse and drug and family problems, is to double the scale of its
service later this spring when it moves to new premises in the centre of
Glasgow.
The charity, which counselled more than 14,000 children last year,
will move from its headquarters in Stockwell Street to new premises in
Albion Street, which will have twice as much space and will allow the
telephone service to be expanded from five to a potential 12 lines.
The new premises, which will be refurbished with assistance from
ScottishPower and other organisations, will employ about 16 full-time
staff and about 100 to 120 volunteers, possibly rising to 150.
Ms Anne Houston, director of ChildLine Scotland, said yesterday that
the charity was delighted to be moving, particularly because present
restrictions in telephone lines and the number of volunteers meant it
was unable to provide counselling to many callers.
She said: ''We estimate that we will be able to handle 100 more calls
each day at our headquarters.
''Support from ScottishPower and other companies means we can effect a
#300,000 development from a budget of only #140,000, which has been
raised specially for the project.''
The new premises will include a counselling suite, training facilities
for staff and volunteers, and administration and library provision.

INVESTIGATORS trying to establish the cause of a gas explosion in an
Inverness council house last week have discovered a leak in the gas
meter, it was confirmed yesterday.
British Gas, however, is still pursuing its own internal investigation
into claims that it had been warned about a gas leak 16 hours before the
explosion.
Officials of the Health and Safety Executive have been examining the
house at 109 Bruce Gardens, Inverness, where Mr James Ross, 82, and his
wife, Margaret, 82, lived with their daughter, Elizabeth, until the
explosion last week.
Yesterday, an HSE spokeswoman said: ''The investigation is still
on-going but I can say that, following intensive tests on the equipment,
a leak was found on the meter installation. HSE is now considering what
course of further action is appropriate in the light of these
findings.''
Last night, Mr Colin Baillie, the depute headmaster who insists he
reported the gas leak to British Gas when he visited Mr and Mrs Ross,
his wife's uncle and aunt, last Tuesday, said he welcomed the HSE
report.
''This has made the case more substantial,'' he said. ''Before we had
no grounds that it was a gas board error but now we have evidence that
it was a gas board leak. As far as I am concerned, the gas board has to
investigate very thoroughly. Now it is even more important to find out
what happened to my telephone call.''
Mr Tom Deans, of British Gas's press office in Edinburgh, said: ''Our
internal investigation into Mr Baillie's call is still on-going and I
mean that.
''We are trying all the ways, all the possible combinations of
different things that could have happened. Meanwhile, the HSE has now
produced its preliminary report and we can confirm that a fault was
found on the meter installation in the house.
''We are looking into this and at the same time pursuing discussions
with the manufacturers of the meter, because it seems as though it was a
gas meter problem, not the pipes or cooker. I am not sure who made the
meter. We have at least 18 million of one sort or another.''

WORKERS who staged a strike to save their threatened Hogmanay break
have called off further action over plans to require them to work at
Christmas as well.
Staff at the German-owned Caberboard chipboard plant in Cowie,
Stirlingshire, staged a two-day strike on January 1 and 2, in protest at
being ordered to work over the New Year holiday.
They then planned further action after being told that the plant will
remain open at both Christmas and New Year next winter.
The Hogmanay strike was the first at Caberboard since it was taken
over by Glunz Industries in 1978. Glunz workers in Germany still enjoy a
full two weeks off at Christmas and the New Year.
However, last night members of the Transport and General Workers'
Union, which represents about 250 of the employees, voted unanimously to
drop industrial action pending further talks.
The union had called for a two-week strike from last Saturday, but
that was postponed at the last minute after protests from some members.
The TGWU regional organiser, Mr John Elliot, said his members were
still furious. ''There was a lot of anger expressed at the stance
adopted by the company, but I hope that over the next two or three weeks
we'll be able to make the management see sense. One thing's for certain,
we're certainly not working those days next year.''
In November, Caberboard's finance director, Mr Peter Lawwell, said the
company needed the extra days' production to meet demand, and said a
current agreement allowed management to require employees to work
statutory holidays if there were insufficient volunteers.
No-one from the company's management was available for comment last
night.

Los Angeles, Monday
THE judge in the O J Simpson double murder trial today ordered the
jury and alternates to be sequestered from Wednesday until the end of
the proceedings, expected to be about six months.
In order to ensure the secrecy of their whereabouts, Superior Court
Judge Lance Ito also ordered a cloak-and-dagger operation involving a
mystery rendezvous point where the 12 jurors and 12 alternates will
gather on Wednesday morning, to be taken by sheriff's deputies to the
place they will stay during the trial.
From there they will be bussed to and from the court each day once the
trial gets under way, expected to be within two weeks.
Simpson, a football legend who became an international celebrity and a
household name across America as a sports broadcaster, actor, and TV
pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole,
and her friend, Ronald Goldman, who were stabbed to death outside her
town house on June 12.
Ito, saying he recognised the hardship involved in the jury
sequestration, told the 24 jurors everything would be done to make their
lives palatable.
''We will try to make this something less than, for example, an
experience of going into incarceration, but it won't be a picnic. It's
going to be very difficult for you,'' he said.
It was announced last week that total sequestration was necessary
because of worldwide publicity of the case.
The jury to try Simpson, who is black, comprises eight blacks, two
Hispanics, one white, and one mixed race Native American white. There
are eight females and four males.
Ito said that in order to ease the burden on the jurors, he had
arranged for regular Wednesday afternoon and weekend family visits
during the sequestration period.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE daughter of an accountant who was shot dead by two men said
yesterday she was told part of the funding for an international
cigarette fraud her father was involved in had come from the Polish
mafia.
She also claimed a Norwegian commodity broker involved in the deal had
feared for his life because a shipment of cigarettes had failed to
materialise.
Miss Michelle Wilson, 28, was giving evidence at Carlisle Crown Court
where American Michael Austin denies murdering her father, Mr David
Wilson, 47.
She said her father had been involved with commodity dealer Torre
Horgen, who had provided $1.8m for Mr Wilson to buy a ship in Miami to
transport contraband Marlboro cigarettes to Europe.
Miss Wilson said her father and Mr Horgen travelled to Venezuela where
the ship was berthed after learning of problems with repairs and that
the cargo had not been loaded.
''Torre Horgan was under pressure from the people who supplied the
money to him. I was led to believe it was the Polish mafia,'' she said.
She was told Mr Horgen had been forced to leave his hotel in the
Venezuelan port of Puerto Cabello because he feared for his life over
the ship and the money he owed.
She said: ''There was a carnival on and people get killed there during
carnivals.''
On the third day of the trial of Mr Austin, of Fort Lee, New Jersey,
Miss Wilon said: ''He (Mr Horgen) thought these people would take the
opportunity to get rid of him. The people who put the money up were from
Poland. Torre referred to them as the Polish mafia.''
The prosecution allege that Mr Wilson, who was shot by two hooded men
at his home near Chorley, Lancashire, in March 1992, was killed on the
orders of Mr Austin because he had spoken to detectives about the fraud.
The Crown claims Mr Wilson and other middle-men around the world
thought they were dealing in Mexican-made Marlboro cigarettes packaged
so they could be sold on as the tobacco company's more expensive US-made
brand.
However, the prosecution say the cigarettes never existed and Mr
Austin, posing as a Mexican army colonel, Hector Portillo, stood to make
a ''real fortune'' out of the deception.
The trial continues.

TORY chairman Jeremy Hanley walked into a new political row yesterday
when he tried to play up Tory successes with a dossier of 100 ''facts''
about Britain in 1995.
A total of seven of his 100 claims related to Scotland and immediately
were shot down in flames by leaders of the opposition parties.
Mr Hanley, claiming that Labour should ''face the facts'', said that
in Scotland:
* Average male earnings had increased by 25% since l979.
* 33% of Scots now go into higher education, compared to 17% in 1979.
* There are now 1400 more policemen in Scotland than in 1979.
* Recorded crime in Scotland in 1993 was down 8%.
* 266,700 homes had been built since 1979.
* Scottish business rates were reduced by #100m in 1992-93 and
1993-94.
* Spending on the Scottish NHS has increased by 47% since 1979.
In general, Mr Hanley said: ''The facts about Britain as we go into
1995 tell a story of a growing economy ready to realise the gains of the
strongest recovery in Europe. These facts are deeply inconvenient to
Labour. To it, bad news is the only news, but for Britain good news is
all about us if we only care to look.''
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, said: ''Jeremy
Hanley uses statistics in the same way as a drunk man uses a lamp-post
-- for support rather than illumination. ''Why is there no mention in
his 'factfile' of the massive hospital waiting lists or the record
levels of homelessnes, poverty, and the unemployed? After lies, damned
lies, and statistics there is now a new category -- Tory statistics.''
The Liberal Democrats' spokesman on Scottish Affairs, Mrs Ray Michie,
said: ''Hanley's seven half-truths about Scotland show that his foot is
still in his mouth in 1995. The real facts about Scotland today are that
the democratic deficit continues with no Scottish parliament, the rail
service being savaged, homelessness continuing to grow, and at least
220,000 Scots without a job.
''No-one, any more, accepts or believes anything said by this
discredited Government.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Hanley had reinforced his position as
the stand-up comedian of British politics.
He went on: ''There are many boasts in this Utopian litany which need
to be seriously challenged. Jeremy Hanley is scrabbling around looking
for scraps of good news in a vain attempt to cover up for the mess the
country is in. The people are not being fooled.''
Labour last night issued its own 100-point ''factfile'', in which it
targeted the alleged rundown in manufacturing output and industrial
employment, and challenged the Government's claims on economic success.
A party spokesman said: ''The dossier from Mr Hanley telling the
British people about the good news of life under the Tory Government
shows how out of touch with reality the Conservative Party is. It is yet
another example of how complacency is placed before competence by the
Conservatives.''

A PUBLICAN told yesterday of his ordeal at the hands of two raiders
who beat him about the head and body with wooden clubs before soaking
him in petrol and throwing lighted matches at him.
Mr Derek McArthur, 27, was still in shock after the early morning
attack by two men which left the family-run Bent Brae Inn in Strathaven
Road, Kirkmuirhill, Lanarkshire, extensively damaged by fire.
He was about to leave the premises at about 1.30am yesterday when the
men conned their way into the bar by claiming to be police officers.
The raiders beat him about the head and body before pouring petrol
over him and the bar area. They warned him he would never see his family
again unless he revealed where the safe keys were.
The attack ended after 30 minutes with the raiders making off with
about #150 in cash from the till and fruit machines which Mr McArthur
had just emptied.
Fire broke out in the bar, taken over by the family in September, as
the raiders fled.
Mr McArthur was able to follow the men out of the building and saw
them drive off in a red Vauxhall Astra van with white lettering on the
side.
He then crawled into his house next door to the inn to warn his wife,
Jan, 27. The couple grabbed their children, Blair, two, and Dale, 10
months, from a bedroom before alerting the emergency services.
Mr McArthur was taken to Law Hospital, Carluke, but was released after
treatment for minor injuries. He did not suffer any burns.
Recalling his ordeal yesterday, Mr McArthur said: ''The back door bell
went about 1.30am. When I asked who it was a voice said, 'It's the
police, open the door'.
''I opened it but left the chain on. They immediately rammed it and
burst in and knocked me to the ground. One of them started hitting me in
the face with a wooden club while the other one kept kicking me.
''Then one poured petrol over me. They said they were going to set me
alight and that I'd never see my family again.
''They kept asking me where were the keys for the safe. I just
couldn't remember where I had left them.''
Mr McArthur added: ''We only moved in September and have sunk all the
money we have into this place. I just can't believe it.''
Mr McArthur's mother, Isobel, 47, from Newton Mearns, said: ''Derek
was lucky to get out alive.''
Detective Sergeant Jackie Robertson, of Lanark CID, who is leading the
inquiry, said: ''This must have been a very frightening experience for
Mr McArthur. He could easily have been trapped inside.''
Appealing for witnesses, he said he was not aware of any similar
attacks in the area in recent months.
One of the attackers is described as being in his late 20s, 5ft 10in
tall, with dark hair, and was wearing a brown leather jacket and denims.
The other man was aged 30, was of stocky build, and had ginger hair and
a moustache, with heavy stubble.

<HEADLINE>Store denies sacking man with pony-tail was unfair</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SUPERMARKET chain Safeway told an industrial tribunal yesterday that
sacking a man for wearing a pony-tail was not unfair dismissal and
sexual discrimination.
Mr Jim Aitken, 26, of Highburgh Drive, Burnside, Glasgow, took Safeway
to the tribunal after being sacked from his local store for wearing his
hair in a pony-tail.
He claimed unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination because women
with pony-tails were not penalised by Safeway.
At the tribunal in Glasgow, Mrs Marie Sinclair, 39, Safeway's regional
personnel controller for Scotland, claimed pony-tails had been banned
because shoppers wanted Safeway staff to be ''clean-cut'' and have a
''conventional'' haircut.
She confirmed the company's code of dress and hair style for men did
not specifically ban pony-tails. She said one of the reasons was that
management, in setting a male hair length not below the shirt collar,
did not think hair that short could be tied in a pony-tail.
She said: ''Senior directors with the company have said no pony-tails.
Senior staff and managers have been told this by word of mouth.''
Asked by the tribunal chairman to look at Mr Aitken and say whether
she regarded him as ''clean-cut'', Mrs Sinclair replied: ''I would say
he is fine.''
Mrs Sinclair also confirmed if Mr Aitken had worked in a fresh-food
department where male staff wore hats and hair nets he would not have
been dismissed if his pony-tail was covered as it would not have been on
public view.
Mr Aitken, who conducted his own case before the tribunal, told the
three members that when he let his hair hang loose it was acceptable to
Safeway because it did not breach the collar-length rule.
However, he said: ''A female member of staff with exactly the same
style as my own and wearing it the same length would not be penalised in
any way. My hair at all times was neat and tidy. I was always well
turned out.''
Mr Aitken, who now works as a labourer with Miller Construction, also
told the tribunal he would ''have been more than happy'' to have worn a
hair net and hat over his pony-tail.
The tribunal reserved its judgement to be issued at a later date.

A SURPRISE bid by Donald Findlay, QC, to include Glasgow's
procurator-fiscal among the defence witnesses in the assault trial of
former Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson led to the case being postponed
yesterday for a further four months.
The new delay was agreed to allow Mr Findlay, who is also
vice-chairman of Rangers FC, to appeal against a sheriff's ruling that
the procurator-fiscal be excused from attending as demanded by the
witness citation.
Mr Ferguson, 23, who was transferred to Everton for #4m last month,
denies assaulting former Raith Rovers defender John McStay, now with
Clydebank, by butting him on the head to his injury during a Scottish
Premier League match at Ibrox in April last year.
His trial had been expected to go ahead at last, after two previous
delays, at Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday. But, at the end of a day of
legal debate over whether procurator-fiscal Andrew Normand should appear
as a defence witness, it was adjourned until May 9.
Mr Ferguson already faces a 12-match Scottish Football Association ban
for the same alleged offence, and a hearing of his appeal against that
ban will not take place until the court case is completed. The new trial
date coincides with the closing weeks of the current football season.
A witness citation from the defence team arrived for Mr Normand last
week, but Sheriff Craig Henry yesterday granted an application from
depute procurator-fiscal Alasdair Youngson that Mr Normand be excused.
During yesterday's legal debate, Mr Findlay was invited to give his
reasons for seeking to call Mr Normand as a defence witness. He
suggested it was possible that he might wish the procurator-fiscal to
speak to matters of mitigation, and matters relating to penalty.
Mr Findlay said he would be entitled to ask the procurator-fiscal how
many cases of violent conduct in, for example, the football or rugby
context, were reported to his office; how many of those incidents
resulted in prosecutions; and how many police inquiries Mr Normand was
aware of, or had instigated, into violent conduct within the sporting
context.
''Because if, at the end of the day, it appears to the court that the
Crown are being selective in the persons that they prosecute and
selective in the conduct that they regard as appropriate for
prosecution, that is clearly a matter your lordship would want to take
into account when dealing with a penalty.''
Evidence might be led that the Crown was very selective in the persons
and incidents that it prosecuted, said Mr Findlay, adding that one could
think of a ''gross and blatant assault'' apparently committed during a
particular football match which the prosecuting authorities in Glasgow
had chosen to turn their backs on. He did not specify which match.
For the Crown, Mr Youngson said that it was difficult to imagine what
questions could be asked of Mr Normand that would not impinge on his
decision-making process. That process was, of course, confidential and
Mr Normand would not be obliged to answer questions relating to it, he
added. The procurator-fiscal was accountable only to the Lord Advocate.
There was nothing that could be asked of Mr Normand as a defence
witness that would not be confidential, that would be relevant to the
facts of the case, or indeed that would be relevant to any mitigation,
he said.
As the debate carried on into the afternoon, Sheriff Henry at one
stage complained of feeling unwell and asked for a short adjournment
before he returned to continue hearing the submissions 15 minutes later.
Before announcing his ruling at the end of the debate, Sheriff Henry
said it was unusual for anyone accused of an offence to cite the
procurator-fiscal to appear in his defence. The context in which the
assault charge arose was also unusual, but the decision to bring a
prosecution had been a matter for the discretion of the
procurator-fiscal.
The sheriff said he was granting the Crown's application on the
grounds that the accused was seeking to have the witnesss available to
speak to matters upon which it was not appropriate for him to be
expected to speak.
Yesterday's postponement was the third in the course of the case. A
trial date fixed for August last year was discharged after the defence
asked for more time to interview additional witnesses introduced by the
Crown, and a further delay took place in October when one of Mr
Ferguson's lawyers had to travel to Australia because of the serious
illness of a close family friend.

<HEADLINE>Russians offer ceasefire to disarm Chechens</HEADLINE>

Moscow, Monday
THE Russian Government today announced a unilateral 48-hour ceasefire
in breakaway Chechnya from 8am tomorrow and ordered rebels to stop
resistance and disarm in that time.
A statement distributed by the Itar-Tass news agency said the decision
was prompted by Moscow's desire to give a chance for a peaceful solution
to the Chechen crisis.
''The Russian Government on behalf of the Russian President offers the
members of illegal armed formations . . . to cease fire between 0800 on
January 10 and 0800 on January 12, leave their positions and armour, lay
down their weapons, and free all people seized in hostilities,'' it
said.
''The Russian Government gave all necessary orders to the command of
the federal forces to cease fire for that period.''
The statement said that all rebel fighters who laid down their arms
would be free under amnesty and allowed to go home safely.
''The government of the Russian Federation expresses hope that the
members of illegal armed formations will accept the offer for the sake
of restoring peace . . . in the Chechen Republic,'' the statement said.
Earlier, Moscow's human rights commissioner Sergei Kovalyov said that
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin backed his plan for a two-day
ceasefire allowing Russian troops to bury their dead and withdraw the
wounded from the Chechen capital Grozny.
Kovalyov, who spent three weeks in the rebel capital Grozny, was
quoted by a senior Russian parliamentary official as saying that the
Chechen leaders favoured the idea of the ceasefire.
''The two-day truce may be extended and give way for proper talks,''
Kovalyov was quoted as saying.
It remained unclear, however, whether the rebels, who had earlier
rejected Russia's orders to disarm, would accept the Kremlin's latest
offer.
Kovalyov said he was heading back to Grozny, where Russian troops were
engaged in street fighting with separatist rebels, to negotiate the
truce with the Chechen leaders.
In Grozny, Chechen fighters clung on precariously inside the battered
presidential palace while Russian troops bombarded it with artillery,
mortar, and machinegun fire.
A Western cameraman said Russian tanks were less than half a mile from
the palace, the multi-storey headquarters of separatist leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev in central Grozny.
''The Russians have the train station and the central market but we
still hold the presidential palace. Sometimes it's burning but we are
still inside,'' said Hamzat Behoyev, a 40-year-old Chechen fighter,
after a night of intense clashes.
In Moscow, the Russian Government conceded that the forces it sent to
crush the three-year-old drive for Chechnya's independence had met
''stubborn resistance''.
There was no firm word on Dudayev's whereabouts. Russian Government
statements say the 50-year-old former Soviet air force general left
Grozny last Friday for southern Chechnya, but this has not been
confirmed.
From a vantage point in an abandoned high-rise residential building,
fires could be seen burning across the city after a night of intense
fighting.
Burnt tanks, bullet-riddled cars, and shattered tree branches littered
streets.
The top of the southern side the palace had been blown away by the
heavy Russian bombardment.
Civilian cars were bringing out wounded from the building, which
houses a hospital for battle victims, and ferrying men and ammunition
into it.
Chechen fighters, in groups of up to 30, darted around the streets to
take up fresh positions against Russian forces.
Small bands of Chechens worked their way through blocks of devastated
buildings towards the Sunzha river, south of the palace.
Western countries, which initially said the Chechnya intervention was
a purely internal affair, showed fresh concern today as the death toll
mounted from Russia's biggest military action since the 10-year war in
Afghanistan.
Britain repeated its call for a halt to fighting and urged both sides
to begin negotiations on a degree of autonomy for the rebels.
''We want to see an early end to the fighting so that civilian
casualties stop and humanitarian relief to reduce suffering can go
ahead,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said.
This measured response contrasted with the hard line taken by Germany,
Russia's closest Western ally, on Saturday.
''We see people suffering, civilians, women, and children, we see
victims among the soldiers and regard it all as complete madness,''
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said.
And France today cautioned Moscow that the campaign could set back its
efforts to build new ties with Europe.
''If the situation continues to deteriorate, if the repression
continues and if human rights are again flouted, we will have other ways
of responding,'' said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.
Norway also condemned the ''brutal behaviour'' of Russian troops
fighting rebels in Chechnya, saying the conflict could threaten Russian
reforms and burden relations with Western countries.

THE world of showbusiness was last night mourning the death at 57 of
Peter Cook, the flawed genius of satirical comedy.
His third wife, Lin Chong, was with him when he died at the Royal Free
Hospital in Hampstead, north London.
His family expressed ''immense gratitude'' to the hospital staff.
The founder and majority shareholder of Private Eye died in the early
hours from severe internal bleeding, a condition often associated with
liver disease.
Cook, always a heavy drinker and smoker, he said as he entered
hospital ''I'm a bit poorly'', but it soon became clear his condition
was far worse.
His widow telephoned his former partner, Dudley Moore, at his
Hollywood home to break the news. Their relationship had soured because
of Moore's success, but they made up towards the end.
Cook's anarchic style of deadpan delivery shone like a beacon in
Beyond the Fringe in 1960, which started as a student revue then became
a smash hit.
Co-stars Dudley Moore, Dr Jonathan Miller, and Alan Bennett all went
on to greater success, but Cook claimed to have no ambition after the
age of 24 and never seemed to quite realise his potential.
His early ambition was to become a diplomat but by 21, after success
in the Cambridge Footlights, he was running The Establishment, London's
first satirical club.
Dr Miller said: ''I had enormous admiration for Peter's comic genius
which, above all others, was the inspirational source for modern British
comedy over the last 30 years.''
Michael Palin described him as completely and utterly irreplaceable.
''He was the most wonderful company, very astute, very sharp, very
funny and had this wonderful ability, which I shall greatly miss, to
show up the absurdities of life.''
Later successes included Not Only, But Also in the 1960s, and the
foul-mouthed Derek and Clive in the 70s, both with Moore. He also made
more than 20 films but did not rate many of them very highly.

HEALTH care reforms could result in patients being taken to hospital
in minicabs, an MP claimed yesterday.
Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, MP for Dundee
East, said proposed trust status for the Scottish Ambulance Service was
an attempt by the Government to run ambulances on the cheap which would
put the public at risk.
''Trusts are driven by commercial criteria, which brings the
possibility of the ambulance service having to bid for each contract.
Non-emergency services might easily have to compete against minicab
companies to be the most cost-effective,'' he said.
But the SAS general manager, Mr Andrew Freemantle, dismissed such
comments as ''alarmist''. The two men had just emerged from a meeting at
SAS headquarters in Edinburgh, where they had been discussing the
reforms.
''To suggest we are going to be less accountable or are seeking to
degrade the quality of service is highly inaccurate,'' Mr Freemantle
said.
From April 1, Scotland's 158 ambulance locations will change from
being centrally funded to serving over 70 health board ''purchasers''.
While Mr Freemantle believes it will result in ambulances responding
more quickly to patients' needs, Mr McAllion fears staff training and
morale will suffer.

PLANS to replicate the voyage in which a lorry toppled over on the
deck of a ferry in heavy seas had to be postponed on Sunday night --
because of storms.
A team of Shell investigators had been due to to make the journey from
the mainland to Lerwick on board the P &amp; O ferry St Clair as part of
their bid to determine why one of their oil tankers toppled over and
damaged nine other vehicles.
The experts were trying to replicate every detail of the trip with the
exception of the weather, but gale force winds postponed the plan.
As a precautionary measure, Shell has stopped tankers taking ferry
crossings if the weather conditions are expected to exceed force seven.
The team were able to drive an identical tanker loaded with 23,000
litres of hydraulic oil on board the St Clair on Sunday to examine the
way the road tanker was secured to the car deck, the type of lashings
which were used, and where they were used.
However, the tanker was driven off before the voyage started.
When the team do eventually arrive in Lerwick they will also examine
the damaged tanker which is still in the dock.
They will also work with a P &amp; O investigating team and the P &amp; O crew
who were on duty during the first voyage.

<TEXT>
THE row over live animal exports from Shoreham -- scene of violent
clashes in the past week -- took a new twist yesterday when one of the
men at the centre of the controversy resigned.
Mr Brian Wilson, chairman of Shoreham Port Authority, announced his
resignation hours after being urged to quit.
However, he said his decision was because of ill-health and had
nothing to do with the livestock controversy at the West Sussex port.
''He emphasises that his decision was nothing to do with the present
problems at the port over the transport of livestock,'' said a spokesman
for the authority.
''It was simply because his health no longer made it possible for him
to carry out his duty as either a board member or chairman.'' Mr Wilson
was not available for comment last night.
Port agents -- representatives of outside companies who are
responsible for arranging shipments in and out of Shoreham -- had
earlier called on Mr Wilson to step down.
They said the decision to export livestock, taken independently by the
port authority, was damaging Shoreham's reputation and making their job
harder.
Last night, as demonstrators gathered at Shoreham for the eighth
consecutive night, the agents welcomed the news of the resignation and
said they would now be asking remaining board members to resign.
Following calls for the authority to end the trade from a Sussex
councillor, claims by Labour that the costs of the policing of the
demonstrations is putting an unfair burden on taxpayers, and reports
that animal welfare groups are collecting new evidence of the
''horrors'' the animals are subjected to, port chiefs are coming under
increasing pressure to abandon the exports.
Mr Pat Hawkes, Brighton council's port authority member, said the
controversy was putting the viability of the port at risk and the
authority should no longer allow the shipments to endanger life and
property and cause public unrest.
The costs of policing the protest, estimated at #155,000 a night, has
caused a cash crisis for West Sussex Police. Police authority members
want the Home Office to provide national funding for the operation.
However, Mr Gavin Strang, Shadow Agriculture Minister, said: ''It is
wrong that hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money is being
used to protect this trade. These police should be tackling crime.''
Eight demonstrators were arrested on Sunday night as three lorries
loaded with sheep and calves made their way through a crowd of 250
demonstrators.
Meanwhile, Compassion in World Farming, the group which organised the
original peaceful protests at Shoreham, will today unveil new video
evidence of calves being reared in continental veal crates.
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave was yesterday making no
comment, after it was disclosed that calves from his family farm in
Somerset had found their way to the Continent.
Mr Waldegrave has said farm managers had no way of knowing where the
animals were going once they had been to market.
But a Conservative MP, Sir Andrew Bowden, vice-president of the League
Against Cruel Sports, says Mr Waldegrave should ensure his animals are
not sold for continental veal -- or he should resign.
The Minister has also come under fire from animal welfare groups.

He refused to commit himself to renationalisation if he failed.
He conceded that to defeat the Government on the issue, he needed to
gain the support of Tory back-bench rebels. ''It is in the nature of the
game'', he said, ''that we have to rely on a certain amount of Tory
dissidents to win a parliamentary battle''.
Mr Blair claimed that his approach to rail privatisation was one of
''sensible and understandable caution''. He is not going to commit
himself if he fails to defeat Mr Major on his privatisation legislation.
''I am not about to start spraying about commitments,'' he said. ''I
am not going to get into the situation where I am declaring that a
Labour government is going to commit sums of money to renationalisation
several years down the line. It is not sensible politics.''
Today the Tories will be quick to jump on this failure by the Labour
leader to state that rail privatisation will be reversed if he gets to
power. Over the coming 12 months such lack of commitment from the
alternative Prime Minister will be exposed as Labour policy emerges.
Potential Tory rebels on rail privatisation will look at Mr Blair's
statement carefully. Their party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, declared
yesterday that Mr Blair was just latching on to ''certain grievances''
without committing himself.
From today, when the Commons returns from the Christmas recess, Tory
rail buffs will be meeting to decide whether Mr Blair's blandishments
are worth serious revolt.
As the two parties locked horns over rail privatisation, Labour MPs
last night sought to embarrass the Government after Transport Secretary
Brian Mawhinney appeared to back down within a day of pledging that a
reduction in railway stations offering through ticketing was
unacceptable.
Dr Mawhinney is now conceding that it is up to the Rail Regulator how
many stations will be able to sell tickets for journeys across the
entire rail network.
Labour's Trade and Industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, immediately
described it as ''one of the fastest retreats in political history''.
It has been a bad few weeks for Dr Mawhinney, with announcements that
Motorail was being axed, sleeper services were being reduced, and the
sell-off of Railfreight was being postponed.
Then in a Sunday newspaper came the leaked story that the Rail
Regulator, Mr John Swift, the man given the task by the Government to
oversee the minimum standards for the railway companies after
privatisation, was going to propose cutting by about 1200 the stations
that can sell tickets for journeys across the network, leaving only
about 300.
His report is not expected until tomorrow, but the leaked story was
not denied. Indeed Dr Mawhinney, in order to smother the expected
outcry, spoke out at the weekend, stating that if the regulator was
proposing a cut then it would be unacceptable. In fact he went further,
stating that there had to be an improvement under privatisation.
By yesterday morning, however, his defence of the ticket system was
less robust. Interviewed on Radio Four's Today programme, he said that
while it was the Government's position that through ticketing should be
readily available, Parliament had decided that the regulator had the
final word.
He went on to stress that the regulator's report this week was only a
consultative document and the final outcome could therefore be changed.
It was up to the regulator to take into account the views of the
travelling public.
He added that even a minimum standard did not mean that many more
stations than the simple minimum could sell such tickets, and the
Government still had the opportunity to give the regulator further
guidance.
The damage, though, had been done. Both Mr Wilson and fellow Scottish
MP Henry McLeish, another Transport spokesman, have been given the task
of harrying the Government's rail privatisation at every opportunity,
and they did not pass up the chance.
Mr Wilson stated: ''On Saturday night, Mawhinney rushed out a
statement specifically stating that the availability of through
ticketing would be no less than at present. By Monday morning he was
back to hiding behind the regulator.
''If the regulator is to retain any credibility, he must resist being
used as a figleaf for the disastrous consequences of rail fragmentation.
For Mawhiney to suggest that the regulator is acting independently in
making these ludicrous proposals is simply untrue.''
As Mr McLeish put it: ''Over the weekend a panicked Mr Mawhinney told
the press that any plan to cut the number of stations selling a full
range of tickets was unacceptable.
''But by this morning all he could do was splutter that decisions of
the regulator were nothing to do with him.
''So which Mr Mawhinney do passengers believe -- the man who talks
tough on a Saturday night, or the one who evades responsibility on a
cold January Monday?''
The row will overshadow the regulator's consultative document when it
is released tomorrow, which is what the Opposition wants.
With railways being an important topic in many Conservative seats in
the South where there are a high number of commuters, the Government
realises it has a difficult time ahead.

WHATEVER type of aircraft is finally chosen to replace the current
squadrons of Nimrods in their anti-submarine and marine patrols, they
will be based at RAF Kinloss, Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman
said yesterday.
Mr Freeman visited the Moray Firth base where 2400 men and women still
live and work around the 24 Nimrods which operate from Kinloss and the
remaining four held in reserve.
He was there to mark the official launch of the Government's
invitation to tender for the #1000m contract to replace the aircraft
which first went into service 25 years ago. The new generation of planes
should be ready in eight years' time.
Mr Freeman said the Ministry of Defence was inviting tenders from four
main companies.
''I would expect to receive the tenders back in the MoD in the middle
of the summer and I hope that Ministers would be in a position to make a
judgment some time in 1996, possibly my mid-1996, of the final
decision.''
He added: ''It is not just the familiar Nimrod airframe, but also the
equipment that goes inside it that is of crucial importance, because we
need to make sure we have the most capable equipment for the RAF,'' he
added.
Mr Freeman said the decision to invite tenders for a replacement was a
vote of confidence in the RAF and the work its Nimrod crews did.
He was happy to give an assurance that Kinloss would be home to the
next generation of maritime patrol aircraft.
''Politicians can always give categoric assurances, because by the
time they can come into service I won't be the Minister for Defence
Procurement.
''But, seriously, as you know as a result for Options for Change, St
Mawgan in Cornwall became only an airfield used for refuelling, for
landing and for various support activities -- but the fleet is here.
''Four squadrons are here, so I would envisage Kinloss retaining its
role now and in the future,'' he said.
The Minister also confirmed, as The Herald reported yesterday, that
the MoD expected British Aerospace to submit a tender to refurbish the
Nimrod fleet.

THE wife of Scotland's biggest national lottery winner predicted that
their family would win a lot of money after reading her tarot cards last
year.
''I thought a lot of money was a couple of hundred pounds,'' her
husband, 31-year-old Joseph McBride, said yesterday.
In the event, the cards were proved right although Mr McBride, from
Whitecrook, Clydebank, was the first to admit yesterday that he had
woefully shortchanged the topline of his expectations as he pocketed a
cheque for #368,000.
Clutching a jeroboam of champagne to his chest like a long lost
brother, Mr McBride, a welder with John Brown's in Clydebank, then held
court in the Glasgow offices of organisers Camelot and proceeded to
prove that Billy Connolly is not the only worker the Clyde has launched
on the public stage with a nice line in patter.
After a few weeks where winners have chosen to remain anonymous, and
in one notable case flee abroad, here was a winner who epitomised the
happy-go-lucky image that publicity men dream about. The smiles on the
organisers' faces as Mr McBride gave his stand-up ''news conference''
were a joy to behold in themselves.
Mr McBride said one of his four sons, four-year-old Cameron, had put
his fingers on the winning numbers. ''Normally I pick them so that's why
I haven't even won a tenner before this,'' he said.
Despite having his wages arrested last week for non-payment of the
poll tax Mr McBride had staked #4 on Saturday on the lottery.
The family then sat down to watch the draw live on TV. When he
realised he had won ''we got a knife and I was scraped off the roof.''
Mr McBride added: ''My sister said we might have won #50,000. I was
down on my knees for #100,000. To win #368,000 is incredible.''
Mr McBride revealed that he had once supported Celtic for six months
but had ''seen the light''. He was now a Partick Thistle supporter and
had been given a ground season ticket for Firhill at Christmas but would
now, as a matter of priority, be swopping it for a stand season ticket.
His wife, Ann, 31, said: ''If we had got the six numbers right we
would have been buying the club.''
Mr McBride, who lives in a three-bedroom council house, said he would
now be buying a house and a car. ''I might install a gym and make myself
look a bit more attractive.''
He had worked at John Brown's for four years but intended giving up
his job. ''Hopefully the cash will last me the rest of my life. I'll
probably die at 34.''
Meanwhile, the first guaranteed #10m lottery jackpot which went
unclaimed at the weekend is expected to lead to a scramble for tickets
with the whole amount rolled over to this week's draw.
Mr McBride shared second prize with six other people who matched five
numbers and the bonus ball to win #368,000 each.

A NATIONWIDE police search for three boys who went missing with their
aunt early on Sunday was called off yesterday when she turned up with
them at a social work office in their home town of Kirkintilloch.
The boys, aged six, five, and 12 months, were last night reunited with
their parents.
Strathclyde Police said a 29-year-old woman was in custody in
connection with the incident and a report was being sent to the
procurator-fiscal. She is expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court
today.
The children were placed in the care of social workers for a short
time yesterday before being taken to Baird Street police station in
Glasgow for a reunion with their parents.
The children's grandmother, Mrs Jean Dillon, refused to comment at her
home in Marmion Drive, Kirkintilloch, yesterday.

ACCOUNTANT David Robertson, who swindled the Church of Scotland out of
#94,500, was jailed for two years yesterday.
He used the cash to pay for his wife's beauty treatments and to clear
his gambling debts.
Robertson, 57, of High Street, Haddington, had earlier admitted
embezzling the money while working as an accountant at the church's
headquarters at 121 George Street, Edinburgh.
The chartered accountant was appearing for sentence at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court.
When Robertson first appeared depute-fiscal Margaret Graham told the
court that he used three different methods of embezzling the money.
He took cheques payable to the church and had them cashed in the
church bookshop at 119 George Street, saying that another department
needed cash at short notice.
The bookshop accounts still tallied but he was able to pocket the
money -- #22,104.55 in all.
Robertson also set up a fake printing company called Duncan &amp;
Robertson and had payments made to it by the church board of
communication for which he worked.
It later turned out that the payments were going straight into
Robertson's personal account at the Trustee Savings Bank. He got #63,307
that way.
Finally, Robertson helped himself to about #6500 from a petty cash
float.
The discrepancies were discovered within a few days of Robertson being
made redundant in March 1993.
Solicitor McKenzie Rigg said that Robertson began to embezzle in a
small way to pay off debts run up by his wife on credit and store cards.
''These were particularly through the more expensive stores such as
Jenners, and normally in connection with beauty treatment rather than
the acquisition of things of value.''
Mr Rigg said that Robertson then began to gamble and lose, and he
embezzled more to pay his gambling debts.
Robertson, a former banker who worked in East Africa, Pakistan, India,
and Zambia, had accepted a substantial reduction in income when he
returned to Scotland to work rather than send his daughter to boarding
school.
''They never enjoyed the high life,'' said Mr Rigg.
''He accepts full responsibility for his actions and makes no excuse
whatsoever for his behaviour,'' he added.
Mr Rigg said that Robertson had paid back his #7000 redundancy payment
and handed over his car, which the church sold for #4000.
His house is to be sold, which will raise a further #20,000 and the
church may be able to reclaim some of his pension rights.
Mr Rigg said that Robertson would not be able to make full repayment
but asked Sheriff Hazel Aronson QC to take into account that he was a
first offender, that he had co-operated fully with the police, and that
he had admitted his guilt.
But Sheriff Aronson said: ''This is clearly a serious crime.''
She pointed out that the church was still owed #63,000, and told
Robertson that he had committed a gross breach of the trust placed in
him as the church's professional adviser.

LIVINGSTON has been chosen by the Jabra Corporation, of San Diego,
California, for an investment project which will create 48 jobs over
three years.
The value of the investment is estimated at #830,000, according to a
spokesman for Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd.
The company has selected Livingston as its European centre for
research and development and the sales and marketing of its products.
Half of the new jobs would be in the research and development sectors.
Jabra, which deals in telecommunications products for cellular,
desk-top, and wireless communications and accompanying software, said
one of its reasons for choosing Livingston was the availability of
highly skilled engineers and graduates.
Mr Allan Stewart, the Scottish Industry Minister, who made the
announcement, said this was a further example of Lothian's investment
attraction.
It followed recent examples of significant investment projects and
expansions, including moves by Jabil Circuits, Mitsubishi Electric,
Adobe, Motorola, and NEC in Livingston.
Mr Stewart said that when he visited Japan in September the president
of NEC told him productivity in its Scottish factory was twice that of
its factories in Japan.
''That is an immense tribute to what is actually being achieved here
in Lothian.''
Mr Stewart was speaking in Edinburgh at the launch of Invest In
Lothian, a new organisation formed to increase inward investment.
It has been formed by a partnership between Livingston Development
Corporation and LEEL. Its budget for its first year will be #900,000.
Co-operation between these two bodies last year attracted investment
of #550m and created or safeguarded 850 jobs.
The partnership has come about because of the need to continue local
investment after the LDC is wound up in December 1996.
Mr Bob Maiden, chairman of LEEL, said Invest In Lothian created a core
group of sales and marketing professionals from the partner bodies.
They would be supported by officials from Locate In Scotland, the
local authorities, and the private sector in the areas of finance,
planning, law, property, and training.
Mr Bob Watt, chairman of the LDC, said Livingston had managed to
sustain an average of more than 1000 new jobs each year over the past 20
years.

<HEADLINE>Three escapers tried to fly to freedom.  Attempt thwarted when Rose failed to start engine</HEADLINE>

AN audacious attempt to fly to freedom by the three prisoners on the
run from Parkhurt was thwarted when they found a plane but could not
start the engine, it emerged yesterday.
Back behind bars at the high-security jail on the Isle of Wight, the
three men said they had got as far as climbing aboard a Cessna aircraft
at Sandown Airport in their escape bid.
But convicted murderer Keith Rose, who was to be the pilot, failed to
get it started, the chairman of the prison's board of visitors, Richard
Gully, revealed after meeting the three lifers.
As details of their five days on the run became known, the Chief
Inspector of Prisons, Judge Stephen Tumim, called for an independent
inquiry into the events at Parkhurst.
''This inquiry should look at the respective roles of the Director
General of the Prison Service Derek Lewis and the Home Secretary Michael
Howard,'' he said.
Judge Tumim wrote to Mr Howard and Mr Lewis on October 7 warning that
basic procedures such as searches and spot checks were not being carried
out properly. Mr Howard has said the warning was acted upon.
But Judge Tumim said that if that was the case then the breakout
should not have happened.
''The authorities in charge had ample warnings of security,'' he told
BBC Radio 4. ''If the procedures have all been followed I don't
understand how these men escaped.''
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw backed Judge Tumim's inquiry call and
Mr Howard is certain to face Labour demands for a Commons statement on
the Prison Service when MPs return today. The Opposition will accuse him
of refusing to face up to his responsibilities and of hiding behind Mr
Lewis.
Mr Howard came under intense pressure after last month's damning
report into the IRA Whitemoor escape. The Parkhurst break-out, the
apparent suicide of Fred West, and the Everthorpe riots have merely
added to his difficulties.
On the Isle of Wight there was widespread relief over the capture on
Sunday night of 45-year-old Rose, murderer Andrew Rodger, 44, and
25-year-old arsonist Matthew Williams.
Mr Gully, explaining what the men told him about their escape plan,
said: ''They did make their way to an aircraft but were unsuccessful in
starting it.
''Keith Rose, who was the pilot, did express his annoyance that he
could not start it.''
The three spent most of the day being questioned about how they
planned and carried out their dramatic escape and their actions while on
the run.
Their short spell of freedom ended when off-duty warder Colin Jones,
28, who works on the same wing of the jail where they were kept,
recognised Williams as the three walked along a main road near Cowes
ferry terminal.
The cold and bedraggled escapees had come out of hiding believing
police had ended their search.
But a vanload of officers -- summoned in a 999 call by Mr Jones --
swooped on the area.
Two special constables told of the dramatic moments leading to the
trio's recapture.
Special Constable Mike Carr, a teacher, said: ''We just happened to be
there at the right time. It could have been any of my regular colleagues
from the island or the mainland.
''I arrested one man and two of my regular colleagues arrested the
second man, and the third man, Matthew Williams, ran off.''
The escapees were ''scruffy, untidy, unkempt, looked as though they
had been sleeping rough for some time''.
Special constable Pierre Cornlouer, who normally works in catering,
chased Matthew Williams but slipped in the mud. He was able, though, to
put colleagues and a dog handler on his trail.
Around 150 police, aided by a plane, hunted Williams -- who was
thought to be armed -- to a marina, catching him 90 minutes after the
other two were held.
He was found in the water and dog-handler PC Tony Woolcock, 41, with
his dog jumped into the water to arrest him.
PC Woolcock said: ''I didn't know at that time if he was armed but
when I reached him he did not offer much resistance.''
Williams was suffering from severe hypothermia when he was brought
back to Parkhurst and the medical care given to him there ''could well
have saved his life'', said Mr Gully.
Hampshire Chief Constable John Hoddinott, who praised his officers for
their work, said there would be ''a series of inquiries'' into the
escape.
He said there was no hard evidence that the escapees were responsible
for tampering with an aircraft at Sandown Airport, but the possibility
was not dismissed.
''We were conscious of the position in terms of aircraft and had made
certain plans,'' he said.
Assistant chief constable Peter Jones, told that the escapees appeared
to have been caught largely by luck, said: ''Good luck and policing go
together.
''We were hoping this type of instance would arise if we kept the
presence on the island and kept these men on the hop.''
Mr Jones said no firearms were found, but a dog search would be made
along the line of escape to see if any arms were dropped.
