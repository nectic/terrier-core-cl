MOST of the things happening in world rugby are interesting right now,
and it's the same for all the moving and shaking going on in our
domestic set-up. Scottish rugby never will be the same with next year's
condensed leagues of eight.
On Tuesday night, it's the Clarkston annual meeting, and a name change
will be mooted to give the club a more regional and Glasgow-sounding
name -- Glasgow South, I believe. Clarkston are making a push, without a
doubt, to become a bigger club within this city than they have been.
They must hope it attracts players.
But all of that pales into insignificance compared to the moves afoot
in the Forth Valley as Stirling County, this season's champions, fight
to retain their status as top dogs in the long term and resurrect an old
concept of a Forth Valley Alliance.
What the alliance would mean is that clubs surrounding Stirling County
would cooperate and act as feeders to the Bridgehaugh side, safe in the
knowledge that they are part of a two-way street.
Stirling County have written to Alloa, Hillfoots, Linlithgow,
Livingston, and Grangemouth for their hands in marriage. ''Yes, I can
confirm it and I am all for the idea,'' says Brian Edwards, the Stirling
coach, originally from Alloa himself. ''Alloa and Hillfoots have talked
for years about mergers, but what we are talking about is an association
of clubs working for the common good.
''Teams like Alloa cannot sustain a youth policy and, anyway, half of
the kids that play at Stirling in the mini rugby are from those areas.
The essence of the approach is to have a Forth Valley area team.''
The idea, apparently, is simple, and it feeds on two mutual needs.
Stirling County, almost to their embarrassment, have a plethora of young
talent aged between 18 and 21, who are too good to play in second and
third XV rugby. Those youngsters need to have their competitive edge
maintained. Stirling also have coaching knowledge. Clubs like the ones
written to have a need for young players, perhaps a lack of coaching
talent, and one or two players who should be playing up a level.
Put the two together and Edwards says the association approach has
value. ''Our young talent needs meaningful rugby, so we need to be able
to farm it out to these smaller clubs. At the same time, Stirling County
get the best players should they wish to move.''
One weakness, of course, is that young players who have been brought
on at Stirling run the risk of degenerating, in a rugby sense, if they
move to a smaller club. Edwards says that has been thought of. ''I did
say it was a two-way street,'' he says. ''We have some very good
coaching here at the club, and we would expect it to go down to help
these clubs too. The coaching is paramount.
''We give them the coaching, which means that we have to generate the
cash to feed the operation.''
Stirling County, as far as I can see, are making one of the most
concerted efforts in the history of the game in this country to become
the biggest club in the land. John Manson announced two weeks ago that
he is to join them. There is no secret in the fact that County would
welcome back with open arms their past player George Graham, now with
Carlisle in league, and there are rumours of bigger names to come yet.
All of which points to the future of the game in Scotland I think.
Stirling County go for the regional approach, Clarkston change their
name, Glasgow Accies are already linked with Clydebank and Greenock,
Ross High in Edinburgh have applied to be a feeder club. What we are
seeing happen is that a good few switched-on minds are getting their
acts together to make them, and their clubs, get into, or stay in, the
Premier Leagues next season. And by association, if necessary, hanging
on to the coat tails of a club they feed.
I really do think that many rugby clubs are now going to give up their
history and tradition, to a greater or lesser extent, as they fight to
be in the top league. Clubs are tradition in themselves. Perhaps
unsuccessful financially and on the playing field, but tradition
nevertheless.
Glasgow is a much cluttered place, but it must be on the cards now
that more of the bigger teams in the city try to fight to become the
official recipients of talent from some of the smaller clubs.
I am utterly convinced that we are seeing rugby change rapidly with
these new leagues, and I am also convinced that some smaller clubs will
now simply disappear. It'll be sad, but it will, nevertheless, be
progress.
''What we are talking about is an association of clubs working for the
common good.'' -- Brian Edwards.

I SEEM to have more faith in Scottish industry and in local authority
planning departments than the Scottish Council (Development and
Industry).
It fears that the new EU Habitats Directive will seriously restrict
development: I am sure that in this day and age neither industry itself
nor the planning authorities would advocate environmentally damaging
development -- would they?
As a point of information, the proposed multi-million pound ski
development on Ben Wyvis referred to in the article on May 15 (EU
Habitats directive ''threatens jobs'' in the Highlands) would not
produce ''hundreds of jobs.''
According to the the planning application, it would would employ three
managerial staff, 15 restaurant workers, and 14 staff with ''general
duties''.
This does not seem much in exchange for a whole mountain with unique
vegetation and approximately #7m of public money.

MANY years ago a colleague told me that there was a certain vantage
point in central Scotland where it was possible to see both the Clyde
and Forth estuaries. He omitted to tell me where, or else I fail to
recall the location.
I have often wondered if it is true, and have speculated that perhaps
the viewpoint is somewhere on the Slammannan plateau.
Perhaps your more energetic readers can put my mind to rest.

CRAIG Brown made his unhappiness with John Spencer clear publicly last
night. It is likely there will be some forceful talking in private
before the Chelsea striker gets another opportunity to play for Scotland
following his ordering-off against Japan.
His suspension could cause problems for the manager ahead of
Wednesday's remaining Kirin Cup-tie against Ecuador, with both Rob
McKinnon and Colin Calderwood having to leave the field with injuries.
Brown said: ''I thought the referee was correct to send Spencer off. I
am very disappointed with the player.
''He will not be sent home because this exercise was intended to keep
players fit for our European Championship match against the Faroe
Islands next month, so we'll give him extra training to make up for the
fact that he can't play in the next match.
''I told him he was daft to show dissent, then to retaliate for the
second booking.
''He hasn't played much here and although that doesn't rule him out of
the trip to the Faroes it obviously puts him in a debit situation for
selection.''
Brown was no more amused by the incident in which McKinnon was
stretchered off and officials were prevented from entering the pitch to
attend to him.
''Stewart Hillis, the team doctor, was sent back to the technical
area,'' said Brown. ''Before the tournament we had a meeting with the
match commissioners and got permission to allow two people on to the
field if a player was injured.''

At Dalmahoy
COLIN Gillies, for several years a successful competitor and prolific
money earner on the Tartan Tour but always frustrated of victory in one
of the main 72-hole tournaments, yesterday corrected the impression of a
player unable to fulfill his true potential when he won the flagship
event, the Tartan Special Scottish Professional Golf Championship.
Moreover, Gillies achieved his breakthrough in the most handsome
manner, decreasing scores of 73, 72, 67, and 66 giving him a total of
278, 10 under the par of Dalmahoy's East course, and the #11,000 first
prize by a stroke over the holder, Andrew Coltart.
Andrew Oldcorn, who led by a stroke with nine holes to play, could not
sustain his momentum on home territory and finished third on 280, a
stroke ahead of Adam Hunter. William Guy, joint fifth with Brian
Marchbank, lasted better than Scott Henderson with whom he shared the
overnight lead but who retreated sharply with an 81.
Gillies is only the second winner in 20 years -- after John Chillas at
Haggs Castle in 1976 -- not to be a card-holder on the European Tour,
and in congratulating his successor, Coltart remarked: ''Colin should
have more faith in himself and give it a go.'' Only two successful
attempts in six at the qualifying school have been powerful deterents.
As winner of the 1994 Scottish order of merit, he would not have had
to endure the pre-qualifying competition for the school, but the
28-year-old still declined the opportunity. However, having also made
the cut in the Open Championship at Turnberry last summer, he should now
be confident of giving a good performance in the Volvo PGA Championship
later this week.
This latest experience might further convince Gillies to try again,
since he began the championship with a double bogey -- ''a good seven,
for I holed a 12-foot putt before either of my partners had played their
third shot,'' he recalled, and, five strokes behind after 54 holes, he
was no more highly regarded than odds of 33-1.
In bright but blustery weather, Gillies came quickly out of the
starting block, hitting a No.1-iron shot to five feet for an eagle 3 at
the 495-yard first. A loose tee shot at the next was his only costly
mistake until he took three putts at the last, but in the course of
turning in 31, the lowest outward half of the championship, Gillies made
five birdies in six holes from the fifth.
Significantly, Gillies played the three long holes in four under par.
''Nothing was going for me until 10 holes from home,'' said Coltart,
relatively four strokes adrift of Gillies at that stage. ''I had a
remote shout then, but I'd left it too late.'' In fact, he had five
birdies, but only two of them derived from the holing-out touch that had
doggedly eluded him.
After the turn Oldcorn's approach shots began to let him down, as he
more than once came up short.
Meanwhile, Jim McAlister, aged 56, of Haggs Castle, took the sponsors'
senior version of the championship and first prize of #1000 when he beat
the Glasgow club's Jack Steven at the second hole of a sudden-death
play-off -- a remarkable outcome since McAlister was five strokes adrift
at the turn but with an inward half of 34 to 39 caught Steven.
John Panton, the honorary professional to the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club, who had beaten his age of 78 with a first-round score of 75,
followed with an 80 which gave him the over-65 award of #500, probably
similar to the prizes he earned when he was winning major tournaments in
his heyday. Final aggregates:

ANYONE who has kicked a ball in earnest attended one or both of the
recent Scottish football awards dinners, a time for reminiscing and
back-slapping. Harmless indulgence, really, at the end of another long,
traumatic season.
The main prizes, the Football Writers' Association and Professional
Footballers' Association player of the year awards, went to Brian
Laudrup, and rightly so.
The Dane deserved his trophies, but also at both dinners was a former
footballer who put to shame some of the people who sat in the same
rooms.
Ian Cashmore might have become one of the game's better performers,
but was not allowed the opportunity because fate intervened.
Cashmore was the victim -- indeed, still is -- of a dreadful accident
on the training pitch. He was signed by Berwick Rangers, but being a
Kilwinning boy trained with Ayr United at Somerset Park until he fell
one evening, 13 years ago during training and broke his neck.
He was, at 21, left paralysed and in a wheelchair. Friends, especially
former players Jim McSherry, who now manages Kilwinning Rangers, and SFA
coach Jim Fleeting, who still see Cashmore regularly, rallied around,
but football largely abdicated responsibility and he might have
withdrawn into himself and become bitter. He didn't. He had a wife and
family and Cashmore accepted his fate, knowing he would have to continue
as best he could because others were relying on him.
It was difficult, but they coped. If you ask me, Cashmore, who up
until a few weeks ago was the manager of a local youth team -- he
stepped down when his policy of giving every player, no matter their
standard, an opportunity was over-ruled -- was the hero of those
dinners.
Every year he comes to the dinners, and he enjoys the banter and
remembers former colleagues with a smile which has never lost its
brightness. The Beam, they call him, because he smiles so often.
Football should be humble in his presence and by now the game should
have taken steps to make sure that what happened to Cashmore, who was
left feeling insecure about his family's future, could never happen to
anyone else.
Tony Higgins and the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association
are anxious to make proper provision, but so far football has work to do
in this field. Footballers, like the rest of us, believe such cruel
misfortune is visited upon others, but everyone is accident prone. It is
all just a matter of degrees.
Maybe it also is a matter of selfishness. Perhaps we don't care
enough, and it could be we want more than the next person and sometimes
we become blinded to the things that are important.
Most players started kicking a ball because it made them feel
important and few, if any, professional footballers decided when they
were small boys that they wanted to play because they could earn money.
Consider Airdrie, for a moment. Here is a collection of mediocre
talents who have excelled again by reaching the final of the Tennents
Scottish Cup for the second time in four seasons. And yet they do
themselves a great disservice by allowing their most colourful players
to deal with only two newspapers.
The Daily Record and the Sun have ''signed up'' Jimmy Sandison, John
Martin, Alan Lawrence, Kenny Black, Steve Cooper, and Andy Smith and
none of this lot have to speak to any other papers.
Yet this is a club which needs as much publicity as possible, a club
with no home and whose planning application to build a stadium is at the
mercy of a regional council planning department. Some day soon they
might need the papers to help them cry foul.
More of us should look to the Ian Cashmores of this world and perhaps
then we might realise how fortunate we are.

FORMER Rangers manager Graeme Souness has signed a one year deal to
manage the Turkish side, Galatasaray. Souness met officials of the club
in Paris yesterday and accepted their offer to take charge.
The one-time Ibrox manager spent four years at Liverpool after
quitting Rangers. After his success in Scotland he flopped on his return
to Anfield and until now has insisted that he would not return to the
game as a manager.
But Galatasaray have wooed him back with an offer believed to be worth
around #300,000 for the one-year deal.

In Japan
THERE is an old saying that a referee's effectiveness is inversely
proportional to his visibility. Armando Perez, the Colombian who is
highly regarded by FIFA, donned a lurid cherry-pink top, waved his arms
a lot, and flashed red and yellow cards with abandon during yesterday's
first meeting of Scotland and Japan.
The referee was the central figure, although it is arguable whether
his handling of the game or the atrocious conditions proved more
significant as Craig Brown's team were held to a scoreless draw by the
host nation in their first Kirin Cup fixture.
Shrouded in mist high above the city of Hiroshima stands the
quaintly-named Big Arch stadium. With virtually all spectators
accommodated in open air, it was remarkable that almost 25,000 watched
their team compete against Scotland in a near monsoon.
For the players, it meant an afternoon of splashing through puddles in
a humid arena, although it was cooler than they might have expected of a
noon kick-off. Why victory was not achieved is a sorry tale of
indiscipline combined with the state of the pitch and mystifying
refereeing errors.
John Spencer became only the second player to be sent off since Brown
became involved with the international team as Andy Roxburgh's assistant
nearly nine years ago. In a total of 87 matches, only Richard Gough had
been dismissed -- against Switzerland in 1992.
Spencer's indiscretions plus further bookings for new cap Craig
Burley, Alan McLaren, and John Robertson, who replaced Paul Lambert when
Spencer went off, put paid to Brown's hopes of enhancing our reputation
for fair play.
Scotland introduced five new players, which may partly explain the
breakdown in discipline, although Burley and Robertson may feel they
were harshly treated by the Colombian official.
There were no real failures. Brian Martin played solidly at the back,
although few teams will ever pose as little threat as the Japanese.
In midfield, Lambert was tactically withdrawn as a result of Spencer's
sending-off, while Burley, Scot Gemmill, and Paul Bernard all made
favourable first impressions.
McLaren started the referee on his run of cards when he scythed down
Narahashi after six minutes. Darren Jackson was lucky to escape when he
slyly elbowed the same player in the face soon after.
Miura, who plays for Genoa in Italy, was also cautioned before
Scotland created the first scoring chance in 23 minutes. Rob McKinnon
sent a deep cross from the left which Burley met perfectly at the far
post, but the goalkeeper smothered his header.
Spencer's brace of bookings sandwiched one for Morishima of the home
side with Burley next in the book for a routine foul shortly after
half-time.
Omura, whose involvement in the incident which led to Spencer's
expulsion was scarcely innocent, was rightly shown the yellow card for
tugging Robertson's jersey.
Scotland ought to have taken the lead after 58minutes. Burley found
Jackson with a quality pass, but the Hibs striker shot wide.
Colin Calderwood felt the effects of a calf strain and was replaced by
Derek Whyte. He was the third and final substitute permitted, so when
McKinnon was hurt by a wild tackle from Narahashi five minutes later,
the Scots were reduced to nine men.
While McKinnon lay in pain the referee ordered team doctor Stewart
Hillis from the playing area. Robertson was booked for complaining about
the lack of treatment.
In 88 minutes Omura grabbed hold of Robertson for the umpteenth time.
Another booking followed and the defender joined Spencer in making a
premature exit.

ROWING
ABERDEEN men's squad maintained their progress with wins in restricted
eights and fours at the Clydesdale Regatta at Glasgow Green on Saturday.
However, they could not outgun the outstanding Nithsdale junior four,
who beat them in the final of the open event as well as disposing of
George Heriot's in the final of the junior event.
In the women's events, George Watson's beat Aberdeen in open eights,
while Heriot-Watt University club had their first success in women's
novice fours. Tom Flannigan also won novice sculls for Heriot-Watt to
give the club double success.
Inverness, made their trip worthwhile with victories in restricted and
veteran pairs.
The regatta also included a Corporate Crew Challenge for the first
time and this was won by IBM, coached and coxed by former Clydesdale
president Gordon Simpson. They beat Commercial Union in a tight final.

for the first time since 1974.
Oban, who lost 2-1, dominated the second half, but found the three
Watt brothers -- Andrew, Alister, and David -- in inspired form. Andrew
Stewart and Garry MacPherson scored for Inveraray with Fraser Inglis
replying for Oban.
Oban's Camanachd Cup opponents, Kingussie, are now playing better than
ever and they won their eighth MacTavish Cup on the trot by beating Fort
William 2-1.
Kilmallie won the MacTavish Juvenile Cup, thrashing Beauly 6-0.
Beauly's Gareth Chima was sent off after an incident with the referee
and could now face a lengthy ban. Kilmallie's first team went down 2-0
to Lochcarron in the first round of the Valerie Fraser Cup.

BOXING
EVANDER Holyfield, the former world heavyweight champion, overcame Ray
Mercer in a gruelling non-title fight over 10 rounds in Atlantic City,
New Jersey, on Saturday night, scoring a unanimous points decision.
Holyfield knocked Mercer down in the eighth with a left hook following
a left-right combination. Just before the bell ended the round,
Holyfield staggered Mercer with a right to the head. Judge Eugene Grant
scored the fight 96-93, Eva Shain had it 97-92, and Jean Williams 95-94.
A cut from a head butt opened alongside Holyfield's right eye but the
blood, although flowing freely, streamed down the side of his face and
not into his eye.
''I was able to hit him with some great body shots,'' said Holyfield.
''But he's a vicious guy and it's hard to get him down with just one
punch.''
Mercer said: ''I'll be back. I'm a man. I can take it. Everybody gets
breaks. I didn't get one.''

JASON BARNETT made an impressive debut for Newlands against the David
Lloyd Club Bushey in Saturday's opening fixture of the Premier Division
of the Everest National Club League, but the 19-year-old Aberdonian's
career-best victory over Australian Brent Larkham -- world ranked No.183
-- in the top singles could not prevent a 4-2 defeat for the Glasgow
side.
Todd Larkham, winner of the LTA Satellite tournament in Edinburgh two
weeks ago, avenged his brother's defeat yesterday when he beat Barnett
6-1, 6-2 as Banbury West End recorded a 5-1 victory over Newlands, whose
sole success came from a three-and-a-half hour marathon win for Watt
over Dylan Williams.
Newlands women were without Scottish No.6 Nicola Burns when they
suffered a 6-0 defeat by Bramhall Park on Saturday, and missed Heather
Lockhart in yesterday's whitewash by Huddersfield, who were led by
Scottish No.4 Jennifer Duncan. Results:
Men: Newlands 2, David Lloyd Club Bushey 4 (Newlands players first) --
J Barnett beat B Larkham 6-4, 1-6, 6-2; M Watt lost to N Gould 6-2, 6-0;
E McGinn lost to A Richardson 6-4, 6-0; I MacAulay lost to G Whytecross
6-4, 6-1; Barnett and McGinn beat Larkham and Gould 7-6, 6-3; Watt and
MacAulay lost to Richardson and Whytecross 6-0, 6-3.
Newlands 1, Banbury West End 5 -- Barnett lost to T Larkham 6-1, 6-2;
Watt beat D Williams 7-6, 6-7, 6-0; McGinn lost to J Trotman 4-6, 7-5,
6-2; R Terras lost to M Wallhead 6-2, 6-1; Barnett and McGinn lost to
Larkham and Trotman 6-3, 6-1; Watt and Terras lost to Wallhead and P
Russell 6-3, 6-4.
Women: Newlands 0, Bramhall Park 6 -- H Lockhart lost to R Mawdsley
6-1, 6-1; M Love lost to J Dawson 6-1, 6-1; C Lockhart lost to F Hearn
6-0, 6-0; E Christie lost to J Taylor 6-0, 6-0; Lockhart and Love lost
to Mawdsley and Dawson 7-5, 4-6, 6-1; Lockhart and Christie lost to
Hearn and Taylor 6-1, 6-1.
Newlands 0, Huddersfield 6 -- N Burns lost to J Duncan 6-1, 6-1; Love
lost to T Croson 6-3, 6-4; J Shaw lost to A Moverley 6-1, 6-1; C
Lockhart lost to K Mitchell 3-6, 6-0, 6-0; Burns and Love lost to Duncan

TENNIS
AUSTRIAN Thomas Muster extended his remarkable winning run on clay to
28 matches to clinch the Italian Open title with a 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-3
win over Spaniard Sergi Bruguera in yesterday's rain-delayed final.
''It's fantastic to win here for the second time,'' said Muster, who
also won the Italian title in 1990.
The victory gave seventh seed Muster his fifth clay title of the year
and confirmed his status as one of the favourites for the French Open
which begins on May 29.
Bruguera, seeded No.8 but the winner of the last two French Opens,
faded out of the contest between arguably the world's top claycourt
players after the superfit Muster took the second set on a tie-break to
level the match.
The final, which began almost four hours late after a downpour, lasted
two hours 50 minutes, much of it played under floodlights on a chilly
evening.
* TOP seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario took the German Open women's title
in Berlin yesterday, beating Bulgaria's Magdalena Maleeva 6-4, 6-1 in an
hour and five minutes.
Spain's Sanchez Vicario won the #537,000 tournament for the first
time, succeeding Germany's Steffi Graf, who had to drop out this year
with flu.
The 23-year-old from Barcelona had reached the final twice before, in
1991 and 1992, but was beaten each time in three sets by Graf, eight
times German Open champion.
Sanchez Vicario had a far easier victory, breaking the serve of her
fifth-seeded opponent early on to lead 3-2 and taking the set in 35
minutes on her third set point.
Maleeva's spirited defence faded rapidly in the second set when she
made numerous faults with her usually firm forehand.
The 20-year-old Bulgarian was underdog from the start, despite having
beaten Sanchez Vicario when they last met two weeks ago on an indoor
court in the Federation Cup in Sofia.
Sanchez Vicario said later: ''I was on my best form and played really
well.''
Looking ahead to the French Open, she added: ''I am in good form and
that is very good for my confidence.''
The Spaniard's victory, in front of 5700 spectators, was her second
this year after the Spanish Open and earned her nearly #100,000.

YACHTING
SCOTLAND'S most successful international sailing helm of recent years
is to make a return to the sport after a two-year absence. Driving an
Ultra 30 on the four-event Vauxhall Ultra 30 UK Grand Prix Circuit will
be Mike McIntyre, the Glasgow-born Olympic gold medallist in 1988 in
Seoul in the Star Class and 1989 Admiral's Cup winning helm. He will be
steering Orbitel, with an eight-man crew including former Scottish 470
dinghy champion Hamish Calder and 1991 British youth champion and
current British match-racing champion Ben Vines.
Despite Olympic and Admiral's Cup success, and experience in the
International 50 Foot circuit and the International Formula One Grand
Prix circuit, McIntyre has opted out of competitive sailing for the past
few years.
Now, he will be back in Scotland for the Vauxhall Ultra 30 Grand Prix
on the Tay off Dundee over the weekend of June 23 to 25.
Joining McIntyre as a novice helm in the Ultra class will be Eddie
Owen, 1993 Fastnet Race winner and skipper for the proposed Welsh entry
in the next Whitbread race.
At the Commodore's Regatta, the third event of the season-long Clyde
championship, raced on Helensburgh's East Patch on Saturday, the busiest
class was once more the one-design Sigma 33 class.
Alan Milton's Pepsi eased out Donald McLaren in Sigmatic while UK
champion Simon Pender in St Joan was caught on the less favoured side
and had to be content with third place.
In Class 1, John Dryburgh's Rhu-based First Class Challenge T-Jig rose
to victory over Malcolm Wooton's Trip 36 Sweet Thing. Results:
Class winners -- Class One; T-Jig (J Dryburgh): Class Two; Valhalla of
Ashton (A and F Dunnet): Class Three; Troy (Overend, Scott and
Sutherland): Class Four; Rona Bowman: E22 Class; Flying Colours (A
Marr): Sigma 33; Pepsi (A Milton): IOD Class; Marenda (G Manuel):
Sonata; Wicked Willie (K and D Aitken): Piper; Sputnik (G Neville).

HOCKEY
GRANGE'S 12-year wait to be crowned Scottish men's hockey champions is
over.
They were duly presented with the trophy at Auchenhowie on Saturday
but, sadly, much of the gloss was taken away from their triumph by
holders McMahon Kelburne.
The Paisley men stole the limelight by defeating Grange's nearest
challengers, MIM, 3-2 in the penultimate match to give the Raeburn Place
side the title before going into their final fixture with Menzieshill.
Derek Forsyth, the Kelburne coach, joked afterwards: ''We had to do it
just in case Grange bottled it against Menzieshill.''
Subsequently, the finale was something of a damp squib and it ended in
a goalless draw.
Stuart Smith, the Grange manager, conceded: ''Kelburne deflated the
situation by their victory and our boys just couldn't motivate
themselves.
''Had we needed to win the match I'm sure you would have seen a
completely different Grange.''
There is no denying that over the season Grange were the league's most
consistent and entertaining side and fully deserved their success.
Moreover, they were the division's top scorers, secured a highly
impressive fifth place in the European Cup-winners' Cup, and achieved
all this without having to plunder foreign markets for recruits.
Gordon Moore was very much the architect of the day's surprise result,
setting up two of Kelburne's goals and scoring one himself.
They laid the foundation for their victory in the first half by
establishing a 2-0 interval lead, and although MIM twice cut the deficit
to a single goal, they never really looked like getting the victory
which would have helped keep the pressure on Grange.
The highlight of the day at Auchenhowie was unquestionably the form of
Stevie Caswell. He scored four of Torbrex Wanderers' goals in their 7-2
defeat of Watsonians.
Graham Joyce scored both Western goals in the 2-0 victory over
Insights Inverleith.
Touche Ross Gordonians escaped relegation by beating Edinburgh
University 4-0 with Andrew Milne and Paul Doney sharing their goals.
Alas, the students return to the second division from where they came a
year ago.
Western Klick Photopoint's second string won their league play-off 1-0
against Melrose to remain in the top flight of the women's league.
Lynn Forsyth, their former Scotland player, scored the all-important
goal. Results:
was once again responsible for their vital goal.
* DONCASTER'S Alistair West scored two goals and laid on a third as
Yorkshire beat Kent 3-2 to win the Norwich Union English County
Championship final in Portsmouth yesterday.
* THREE goals from Tina Cullen helped Hightown to a 5-0 win against
Trojans in the final of the AEWHA Cup at Milton Keynes.

LOUIS van Gaal, the tactical genius behind all-conquering Ajax,
insists victory over AC Milan in the European Champions' Cup final in
Vienna on Wednesday is essential for the well-being of football.
Despite fielding five reserves, Ajax went to Rotterdam on Thursday to
beat Feyenoord 5-0 and provide conclusive proof that they are primed for
the ultimate test of their astonishing talents in the Ernst Happel
Stadium.
Van Gaal, whose team is also undefeated in Europe, said: ''It is vital
we beat Milan to prove attacking football can capture the game's supreme
trophy.
''If this happens I believe it will encourage other clubs throughout
the Continent to follow our example.
''In 1974, Holland were clearly the best and most exciting team in the
World Cup finals in Germany. If that team had won there would have been
a positive spin-off.
''Instead, a negative trend developed after Germany won.''
* MARCO van Basten will announce after Wednesday's final that he will
sign a one-year contract with a two-year option for AC Milan, thus
allaying fears that his career was finished.
* ANDERLECHT'S 2-0 win at Ghent on Saturday clinched the Belgian
championship for the twenty-first time.
* BRAZILIAN side Corinthians have joined battle with Santos to entice
Argentinian Diego Maradona back as player-coach.
* ECCENTRIC Colombian keeper Rene Higuita scored a 30-yard free kick
and a penalty in Nacional Medellin's 3-1 win over Pereirra.
* JUVENTUS won their first Italian league championship since 1986
after thrashing nearest challengers Parma 4-0 at home yesterday.
Fabrizio Ravanelli scored twice, with the other goals coming from
Gianluca Vialli and Frenchman Didier Deschamps as Juventus avenged their
defeat by Parma in the UEFA Cup final. Roberto Baggio had a hand in
three of the goals.
* SCOTLAND'S top scorer is set to quit Cowdenbeath for England and the
chance of full-time football.
Mark Yardley netted 27 goals for the third divsion side to finish top
of the strike charts. Now the 26-year-old is hoping for a move south of
the Border.
Yardley said: ''I've had contact from three English clubs. One first
division side and two in the second divsion.
* CHRIS Waddle is favourites to take over from Trevor Francis as
Sheffield Wednesday manager.
Francis found himself out of work on Saturday and now speculation will
switch to who takes over -- with Waddle a possibility to assume the role
of player-manager.

DONAL Nolan, in his third season as a Flat trainer, got off the mark
at Hamilton on Saturday when Lord Advocate, at 20-1, romped home by five
lengths in a seller.
Lord Advocate was never headed and, under powerful driving of
apprentice rider Neil Varley, stayed on to deny the late challenge of
Jack Berry's Monkey Wench.
He also foiled a substantial gamble on Preston Guild, the 11-4
favourite, who finished third.
Nolan, based in Wishaw and one of the characters of Scottish racing,
was undismayed that he had backed his horse earlier in the day at 16-1
-- four points less than the starting price.
Len Lungo had his second winner on the Flat in 10 days when Noyan
(7-4) took the Draught Guinness Handicap.
His defeat of course-specialist Mentalasanythin was even more decisive
than it had been on the last occasion at the Lanarkshire track. Kevin
Darley pushed him along to take the lead two furlongs out, and Alan
Bailey's six-year-old never looked like getting the upper hand.
Noyan, who won three on the trot as a two-year-old, will have one more
race before getting a summer break in preparation for another season
over hurdles.

* JOCKEY David Harrison was banned for seven days by the Lingfield
stewards for irresponsible riding on Apollono, first past the post in
the Oastwell Wines Handicap.
Apollono beat Dancing Heart by a head. But the officials found that
Apollono and Harrison had interfered with Wandering Minstrel a
furlong-and-a-half from home.
Dancing Heart, ridden by Brett Doyle, was promoted to first place,
Wandering Minstrel to second, with Apollono (10-1) placed third.

KILLICK, impressive winner of a mile-and-a-half handicap at Chester,
would appear to have every chance of repeating that success in the East
Lothian Handicap, feature race of this evening's meeting at Edinburgh.
Against better rivals than he meets tonight, Alan Bailey's
seven-year-old made all to beat Shakiyr by two-and-a-half lengths. An
8-1 chance at Chester, he is almost certain to start a short-priced
favourite.
A course-and-distance winner on two occasions, Dick Allan's Latvian
must be given a chance, especially after his third at Newcastle two
weeks ago.
Another possibility is Mel Brittain's Gold Desire, who finished well
in Lord Advocate's race at Hamilton on Saturday evening.
Euro Sceptic, who stayed on well to win a seven-furlong handicap at
Beverley on Saturday, has a 2lb penalty for that success but should have
no trouble in disposing of his rivals in the Musselburgh Honest Toun
Handicap.
Tom Kemp's Ricana has shown improvement in his four runs, and Pash is
a winner over this course and distance.
Aquado, who won the opener at Hamilton at the weekend, attempts to
repeat that success in the East Lothian District Council Handicap.
Mbulwa attempts to win the race for the second consecutive year, but the
top weight, Don Pepe, who has won over the course and distance three
times, must be respected.
The Ron Boss four-year-old is partnered by Kevin Darley.
The newly completed hospitality stand, to be opened by The Queen on
July 3, will be given a ''trial run'' tonight.
* TRAINER Mark Johnston landed a 384-1 treble at Thirsk, emphasising a
return to form for the Scot after an early season wrecked by a virus.
Wins by Celestial Key, Sweet Robin, and Double Quick proved that
Johnston's string is back in the best of health after having been hit by
coughs and splutters.

Brian Meehan's four-year-old has run well over sprint trips but always
seems to be tapped for speed at the finish.
She should appreciate the step up to an extended mile here and it is
interesting that jockey Brett Doyle, originally booked to ride Cork
Street Girl for Meehan at Bath, switches venues.
The fact that Legatee is blinkered for first time also should be
noted.
Miami Banker can step up on an encouraging reappearance run to win the
Johnson Handicap.
He looked in need of the run when reappearing over course and distance
a fortnight ago, but led until the final furlong, coming home
five-and-a-half lengths fifth to The Real Whizzbang. Miami Banker can
steal a march off his low weight this time.
Best bet at Bath is Oggi in the Timeform Raceview Handicap. Peter
Makin's charges often need a few runs to get them straight. So Oggi
should be spot on now after an excellent two-length second of 17 at
Hamilton last time out.
On the subject of Scottish tracks, Habeta can show he is no back
number by winning the East Lothian Handicap at Edinburgh.
At first glance it would be easy to dismiss Bill Watts' nine-year-old,
who is attempting to end a losing run dating to May, 1993. But he showed
he retains ability with some decent placed efforts in the first half of
his campaign last season, notably when one-and-a-half lengths second to
Lazienki in a competitive race at Ripon.
And Habeta shaped encouragingly on his latest start at Hamilton.
Held up, he stayed on well in the closing stages to finish
five-and-a-half lengths fourth of 11 to Nigel's Lad.
The handicapper has allowed Habeta to plummet to the foot of the
handicap and he now races on a 14lb lower mark than at Ripon.
Watts' yard has found a bit of form lately and this ordinary race
looks an ideal opportunity for Habeta to roll back the years.

WESTERN UNION
AYR enjoyed a sight-seeing summer last year, steadily climbing towards
the top of the DM Hall Western Union where they spent much of the season
looking down on the rest. This season, the Cambusdoon club have opted
for an action-packed summer break, starting off on the rollercoaster if
their early results are anything to go by.
Defeat by nine wickets on the opening day at Greenock was followed by
successive wins over West of Scotland and Ferguslie, the champions using
the same script on both occasions, scoring just over the ton, then
bowling out the opposition.
And the storyline was similar yet again on Saturday when Ayr met
Tilbury Pheonix Kelburne at Whitehaugh -- only this time the roles were
reversed as the Paisley club took victory by 48 runs, having skittled
out the title holders for just 66.
Ayr pro Adrian Holdstock had been the leading player in putting his
side in what looked like a commanding position on a bowler's wicket.
Despite useful knocks from Donnie McNair and Roger Telemachus,
Holdstock's five for 45 helped to end the home side's batting on 114.
But it was a target that looked a mile away once Telemachus started his
shift with the ball.
Scotland opener Bruce Patterson has not had the happiest of times with
the bat in the Union, his contributions so far being 8, 9, and 15. At
the weekend, he did not even trouble the scorer, routed first ball by
Telemachus off a delivery Bruce decided to leave alone.
Enter Albert Simpson. Next ball, exit Albert Simpson as Telemachus had
Ayr 0-2 from two deliveries. Gavin Caven then surrendered his wicket in
a silly run-out, with Jamie McDonald removing Holdstock, again for a
duck, to leave the champions 4 for 4.
Colin McCrossan and David Simpson halted the slide, until Telemachus
struck again . . . and again . . . and again. Three times the Kelburne
pro was on a hat trick during the afternoon, and while he missed out on
each occasion, he still finished with figures of seven for 26 to take
Kelburne to their victory
And as it turned out, that was the only positive result in the entire
Union programme. Uddingston managed to avoid defeat for the first time
this season against Poloc at Shawholm. For once, someone else other than
Sajid Ali top scored, the honour going to Ian Holten who made an
unbeaten 51 in the home total of 192 for eight.
To win, Uddingston needed 100 from the last 20 overs with only two
down. But the loss of a couple of wickets put thoughts of a chase on the
back burner, leaving new king of the block, George Reifer, to prod his
way to an undefeated 87.
Aamir Hanif stroked his second century in four league games for
Progress Software Clydesdale down at Glenpark against Greenock.
His innings, which included a dozen boundries and one 6 helped
Clydesdale to post 232 for four, a figure which Greenock did not look
like catching. Survival was the first thing on the agenda for the home
side having slipped to 8 for two, openers David Duthie and Stewart
McDonald removed by Ian Stanger and Alan Burgess.
Greenock survived thanks to a couple of colourful innings from David
Brown (44) and Tom Black (41) guaranteeing a share of the points.
Drumpellier and West of Scotland also split the points while Asif
Mujtaba and Jimmy Hill both hit 50s for Kilmarnock against Ferguslie,
who looked on course to catch and pass the visitors' figure while Neil
Curran and Mike Pawson were on the go. When the latter departed,
however, so too did any chance of victory.

KENYA'S five-time world cross-country champion, John Ngugi, banned for
four years in 1993 after refusing to take a random drug test, has been
cleared to compete again, said the International Amateur Athletic
Federation yesterday.
''The lack of information available to Ngugi at the time he refused
the test, as well as the language problem involved in the case, made it
proper and correct to exercise clemency in this case after Mr Ngugi has
been out of the sport for 27 months,'' said a spokesman.
The ban was imposed after Ngugi refused to take a random test in his
rural home of Nyahururu, 125 miles north of Nairobi. He said the IAAF
test team had not properly identified itself and was not accompanied by
a Kenyan track official.
The 1997 World championships will be staged in Athens, it was
confirmed.

AREA CHAMPIONSHIP
STRATHCLYDE East broke their duck in the Royal Bank of Scotland Quaich
at Dumfries to leave South still looking for a win.
North remain unbeaten having inflicted Strathclyde West's first defeat
while Edinburgh's eight-wicket home win over Central keeps them in the
same position.
Strathclyde East openers, Alistair Storie and Greig Williamson, put on
45 runs before the latter was out and the cautious approach took
Strathclyde East to 111 for three at lunch.
The batsmen then opened out, with Storie, who ended nine short of an
unbeaten century, Paul Dunn, and Ian Stanger all contributing to 86 runs
coming from the remaining 12 overs.
South began well in reply, the score having reached 51 before
Williamson had Ralph Laing caught behind.
They were still up with the run rate when the second wicket fell at
73, but a collapse followed.
Top scorer was Douglas Wilson with 47, Aussie pro Brad Bannister made
only one, and South were all out for 115 after 54 overs. Williamson
picked up four wickets and Keith Sheridan had three.
The star of Edinburgh's show was 'B' cap Bryn Lockie, whose unbeaten
136 put the earlier 94 from Iain Philip into the shade. Philip had
looked set for his own ton until bowled by Ewan McIntyre, but with solid
contributions from Willie Sullivan, Steve Crawley, and Bruce Russell,
Central still set the healthy target of 274 for five.
What Central lacked though, was bowling strength, with Freuchie
involved in a Village Cup-tie. Roddy Smith was dismissed in the fourth
over with eight onthe board, but Gordon McGurk took the score along
until he was out to the last ball before tea with the total on 112.
After the break, Mike Allingham and Lockie put on 163 unbeaten in 24.1
overs.
At Prestwick, Strathclyde West were rescued by an eighth wicket
partnership of 86 by Stewart Kennedy and Sandy Strang which saw them up
to 174 for eight. Veteran keeper Strang then produced a brilliant catch
to dismiss George Salmond.
Spinners Douglas Wylie and Andy Tennant then pinned down North, but
they still came through to win with two overs to spare.

EAST LEAGUE:
THE verdict was terse. ''We simply were not good enough. Our
limitations were shown up,'' said Stenhousemuir professional Iain Philip
after he and his colleagues had submitted abjectly to defending Ryden
East League champions Heriot's at The Tryst on Saturday.
This was an excellent result for Heriot's, who have shrugged off the
departure of Graham Hurlbatt and the retirement of George Goddard to set
a cracking pace in the current campaign.
Skipper Euan McIntyre, with four for 15, and pro Shahid Aslam, with
three for 61, tore through the visitors' line-up to dismiss them for 108
on a track which had earlier yielded 78 to Jim Love, 41 to Aslam, and 36
to Steve Thomson.
Coincidentally, 108 was also the best that the powerhouse Grange
line-up could muster after having been put in by Watsonians at Myreside.
Trinidadian John Pollard did the main damage with five for 30 off 21
overs, of which 12 were maidens.
That left little leeway for the bowlers, although at 49 for four,
Watsonians were looking shaky. If a catch off Mike Leonard had stuck,
there might just have been a different story, but the young opener took
full advantage of his escape and was unbeaten at the finish with 59,
skipper Keith Flannigan holding down the other end to ensure victory.
A catch which was held was the one which dismissed Royal High's
Manzoor Elahi at Corstorphine.
The professional miscued between Alan Spiers and Kevin Azam who ran
full tilt into each other in the pursuit. Astonishingly, Azam clung on
and the pro departed as the opposition attempted to bring round their
casualties. Happily, no bones were broken and the match boiled up to a
tight finish, Corstorphine's last pair surviving seven balls to wind up
six runs adrift.
Stewart Farquharson was High's top scorer with a belligerent 74, aided
and abetted by Abdul Rehman's half century. For the home side, Dean
Sutherland and Shahid Saeed shared an opening stand of 129 before both
were out in the space of three deliveries.
Carlton's Scott Baker was another in aggressive mood, hitting five 6s
in an unbeaten 89 as the Grange Loan men claimed their third victory on
the trot. Jim Govan weighed in with 54 and then took three Edinburgh
Academicals wickets as the home side slumped to 127 all out in the final
over. Robin Singh had five of them for 43.
The Fife derby finished in a draw, Falkland holding out despite Scott
Birrell's five for 12 against visiting Freuchie.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES
THE coin, as it was flipped, flashed briefly in the sunlight, and fell
on dampness. Wickets were sticky after the previous day's rain.
The skipper who called correctly gleefully stuck the opposition in to
bat. The bowlers pounded in. And in five county matches, those who were
able to bat second won with ease.
The perfect example was at Williamfield. Local lot Stirling County,
after an early hiccup when Stuart Campbell departed for a duck, were
grinding out some sort of score. At 46 for one, with around 30 overs
bowled, and professional Kyle Wealleans on 30, there was some hope.
Three wickets down at the same score, another couple when 51 was
reached, and the remaining four all tumbling at 65 suddenly had
Forfarshire in total command after only 38 overs.
Forfarshire eased home with seven wickets to spare, with their main
tormentor being Bryce Robertson. His figures of six wickets for 28 aptly
describe the havoc he wreaked on the Stirling batting line-up -- at one
point, he even was on a hat trick.
Robertson reckons his success so far this season had a lot to do with
his spell practising with Scotland B before the match with Durham last
year. ''It certainly opened my eyes as to what good players are really
like. You have to bowl much tighter.''
Fifteen wickets in three county games are proof so far that the
Forfarshire 26-year-old is a quick learner. His striking partner at the
other end, James Girolami -- ''I know it sounds like a foreign name, but
I was born in Broughty Ferry'' -- also has been knocking over the stumps
this season, and he weighed in at Williamfield with three for 19.
On the credit side for Stirling, Willie Morton did not allow
Forfarshire to get their runs too easily, taking three for 12. But as
the wicket dried out in the sunshine, the home side's task was nigh
impossible.
At the North Inch, it was a similar tale. Chris Galloway was unbeaten
on 65, but was given little support as Perthshire were all out for 105
against Aberdeenshire, whose pro, Sanju Mudkavi, took five for 23. Mike
Smith's unbeaten 77 took his side to 106 for one, and 25 points.
Drew Parsons with 72, Dominic Rigby's 66, and a competent 30 by David
Harper all contributed to Ayrshire's 194 for three at Prestwick Oval,
and was more than enough to pass Arbroath County's total of 193 for
nine.
Kevin Ritchie had hit 64 and Murray Clark 52, but Ayrshire's Andy
Tennant was a mite too sharp, taking five wickets for 63 runs.
West Lothian probably had the closest result of the day against
champions Strathmore up at Lochside Park. Mark Mudie's three for 21
restricted them to 132 for nine, and despite Ian Beven's five for 41,
Willie Duthie's 42 was enough to help Strathie to pass the target at 134
for seven.
Malcolm Howell had quite a day for Clackmannan up at McKane Park
against Fifeshire. In what was virtually a one-man show, he skittled out
the home club with figures of six wickets for 13 runs in 20 overs and
three balls. Fifeshire were all out for 77.
Step in Mr Howell with the bat, as an unbeaten 49 took the wee County
to 80 for two. The day's efforts now leave Ayrshire and Strathmore
County joint top of the league.

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
THE Scottish Claymores' hopes of making it to the World Bowl on their
own merits were sunk by Amsterdam's Admirals 30-13 at the weekend.
After leading in the second quarter by 13-6, the Scots gave up a
momentum-changing touchdown just before half-time and never recovered in
the second half, allowing the Admirals, now undefeated in seven games,
to score 17 unanswered points and run out easy winners.
Now the Claymores, who have won only one of their seven matches, must
win their remaining three matches and also gain help from the results of
other World League fixtures if they are to qualify for the June final.
Ironically, it was a wide receiver called David Jones who pulled the
plug on the Claymores and consigned them to the World League locker when
he latched on to an 18-yard pass from Will Furrer in the back of the
Scots end zone with 10 seconds left in the first half.
It was a blow which stunned the Claymores, who up until then, had been
in control of the game after an early touchdown from Siran Stacy on a
one-yard run and two Sean Conley field goals.
Stacy scored only two minutes into the game after the Claymores'
defence had come up with a big play on their first series -- Amsterdam
quarterback Jamie Martin fumbled the snap on the Admirals' first play
and defensive end Alan Young pounced on the ball at the Dutch two-yard
line.
The Admirals, without top rusher Ralph Dawkins, out for the season,
went to back up running back Troy Stradford who twice moved them into
scoring range, but the Claymores defence held firm, limiting the Dutch
to two Terry Belden field goals from 37 and 29 yards.
At the start of the second quarter Conley answered back for the Scots
with kicks from 30 and 34 yards to bring the score to 13-6. However, the
Claymores squandered two golden opportunities to score at the end of the
second quarter when, with three minutes left in the half, free safety
Darrell Lewis intercepted Admirals quarterback Will Furrer at the
Claymores' 35. But the offence failed to move it and the Scots were
forced to punt.
Remarkably, on the Admirals' next drive, the Scots defensive secondary
came up with another big play when a Furrer pass was tipped and then
intercepted, this time by Claymores cornerback Darren Butler who ran it
back to the Admirals' eight yard line. But again the offence stuttered
with quarterback Matt Blundin unable to find an open receiver. That
brought on the field goal unit again and Conley lined up a four-point
kick from 50 yards. But his attempt was blocked and recovered by Blundin
who was forced to throw the ball out of bounds at the Scots' 43.
Amsterdam took over possession with 18 seconds left and three plays
later Furrer hit David Jones, bursting the bubble on the Scots momentum.
The game continued to roll Amsterdam's way when Martin completed a
47-yard pass to receiver Ernie Jones. Running back Stradford then caught
a Furrer screen pass two plays later and broke three tackles to take the
ball into the end zone.
At the start of the fourth quarter the Jones boys hit again when Ernie
outran Claymores cornerback George Coghill to catch a 46-yard arching
Martin pass in the end zone. Belden converted the extra point again to
move the Admirals further ahead at 27-13 before he kicked a 24-yard
field goal with five minutes left in the game.
Afterwards, Claymores head coach Jim Criner had no complaints. ''I
thought we had a good shot at it in the first half but the big play was
that blocked field goal.''
Now, Criner must somehow pick up his troops for next Saturday
evening's match at Murrayfield against Barcelona Dragons, his task
complicated with injuries to both of his quarterbacks. Matt Blundin took
a knock to his ankle and had to leave the game in the third quarter, but
the injury to Lee Williamson, who replaced Blundin, is more serious -- a
dislocated shoulder may put him out for the rest of the season.

ENGLISH ROUND-UP
YORKSHIRE'S Bradford pitch has escaped censure from the Test and
County Cricket Board after it was reported by the umpires on the second
day of this week's county championship victory over Glamorgan.
TCCB representatives watched as Yorkshire wrapped up a seven-wicket
victory with five sessions to spare -- their third successive
championship win.
Pitches consultant Harry Brind and Donald Carr, chairman of the
pitches committee, headed a four-man party that decided the strip did
not fall into the ''poor'' or ''unfit'' categories.
It meant Yorkshire avoided a formal censure, although the group felt
the pitch was not ideal for a four-day match.
Tim Lamb, the TCCB's secretary for cricket, said: ''They accepted that
the groundsman had tried to achieve more pace and bounce than has been
the case on previous occasions at Bradford, when it was felt to be too
slow and low.
''But the panel did feel that there had been too much grass left on
the pitch. This had occasionally produced very high bounce which was the
reason it was reported in the first place.''
* A CROWD of more than 6000 poured in for the first AXA Equity and Law
League match at Durham's Riverside ground in Chester-le-Street and were
rewarded by a two-run victory in a low scoring game against
Warwickshire.
The champions slumped to their third successive defeat as they were
restricted to 130 for nine on a pitch offering extravagant bounce.
They also face a fine after bowling only 38 overs in the two and a
half hours allowed -- largely because they sent down 16 wides, one of
which went for four.
The 26 extras they gave away proved crucial as only Manoj Prabhakar
scored more than 20 for Durham, who made 132 for nine.
Warwickshire's two quickest bowlers, Gladstone Small and Paul Smith,
conceded only 36 off their 16 overs, with 14 of the runs coming in
wides.
The visitors looked set to cruise to victory when they reached 40 for
one after 10 overs. But Simon Brown stepped in with two wickets in two
balls to begin a slide that was continued by Mark Saxelby's first Sunday
wickets for Durham.
With neither side prepared to risk their spinner, Durham called on
Saxelby's medium pace and he took three wickets before being recalled
with 13 needed off three overs and one wicket standing.
He conceded only two off the 36th over and four off the last to finish
with three for 18 and clinch Durham's first Sunday win of the season.

AC MILAN will attempt to win their second successive European Cup --
and their sixth in all -- in Vienna on Wednesday night, and most of the
hundreds of millions who will watch around the world on television will
be willing the Italians to triumph. They are football's strutting
aristocrats. Wealthy and suave they have become synonymous with success.
Their appeal this time is enhanced because only six months ago they
were being written off. Franco Baresi looked weary, worn out, the
sparkle had gone from Roberto Donadoni's work, and Dejan Savicevic, who
had destroyed Barcelona in last year's final, seemed without impulse or
direction and their #14m signing Gianlugi Lentini appeared troubled.
Milan's manager, Fabio Capello, insisted the malaise was the
consequence of a World Cup finals hangover -- Italy, with seven AC
players in the squad, lost to Brazil in the final last summer -- and
that as the season progressed his players would respond. ''The world
will not see the real Milan until the second half of the season,'' he
said.
Capello was correct, but the revival came too late to win another
''Scudetto'' and Milan concentrated on the Champions' League, although
their progress to the final was laboured, certainly in the early group
stages when they were beaten by Ajax, who will be their opponents on
Wednesday.
Despite defeat and a two-point deduction because of a bottle-throwing
incident in a home match against Casino Salzburg, the Italians managed
to qualify for the quarter-finals, where they beat Benfica and then
Paris St Germain in the semis to come face to face with the Dutch
masters for the second time in the European Cup final. Milan won 4-1 in
Madrid in 1969 and Capello says his players are ready again and that the
huge urn of a trophy will remain in their hands.
So many are anxious to believe him. It is as though Milan's dominance
has become comforting in a world which seems to be in turmoil and
heaving with change in so many other fields.
It is the logic of the masses but it is a perverse one. That Milan's
hegemony is threatened should be a source of inspiration and we should
be rejoicing that the end of a potent regime could be nigh because in
every demise within football, there is a new beginning, a future. That
future could be something equally bright and wonderful as Milan's play,
and we could glimpse it on Wednesday with the second coming of Ajax.
The Dutch side won the cup three times in succession in 1971, '72, and
'73, beating Panathinaikos, Inter-Milan, and Juventus, and although they
reached the final of the European Cup-winners' Cup in '87 and '88,
winning the first and losing the second, they have never been back to
the final of the Champions' Cup until now.
They have succeeded because they stopped and looked again at their
system of creating footballers even though it was widely accepted as the
best example of youth development.
While many clubs have dabbled in development, only a handful have
found the secret. Ajax are leaders in the field because they have taken
a scientific and humanitarian approach to youth football.
Their offspring are influential wherever in the world a ball is being
kicked, and, unlike Milan and the vast majority of Europe's top sides,
they rarely buy in their talent.
Jari Limanen is a key player, but the Finnish internationalist was
adopted into the system for a small fee, as were two young Nigerians,
Finidi George and Kanu, who would have felt comfortable at Ajax
immediately since almost 90% of the young players who show up for trials
at the De Meer Stadium are black. In fact, perhaps as many as six of
Wednesday's team will be black, whereas Johan Cruyff's team of total
footballers in the 70s were all white.
In 1981, Frank Rijkaard became the first black player to wear the red
and white of Ajax, and he will be joined by at least six others against
Milan, which also represents another critical change in the club's
development. Most of the players can trace their roots to Surinam and
some to Morocco, and perhaps the brightest of them all is Clarence
Seedorf, an extremely talented midfield player.
I remember watching him play in a practice match a few years ago on
one of the training pitches outside De Meer, and his skill and technique
were obvious then. He was only 16 and at the time Co Adriaanse, who was
instructing the players, pointed to Seedorf and said: ''Remember him. He
will be a star one day.''
Speaking last week, Adriaanse, who is responsible for Ajax's
development system, said: ''It isn't possible for every player to become
great or even good and because of that we don't drag young players away
from school.
''We believe it is important that they progress at school and if they
get poor marks, their training sessions are cut back to allow for repeat
lessons. If there is no improvement they lose their places in the
teams.''
The club's senior coach, Louis van Gaal, said: ''I know all of our
youngsters between the ages of six to 16 and I congratulate them more
often on passing exams than on their performances on the pitches.''
Graeme Souness, when manager of Rangers, touched on the difference in
intelligence between European players and British players, believing the
foreign approach to the game to be much more cerebral, and his theory is
underlined perfectly in Holland where the dux pupils learn.
Seedorf graduated quickly and pointed out: ''An Ajax ace is master of
the ball and can keep possession in spite of fast pace. Also, he has to
know in a flash where and when to pass the ball to keep up an attack.
''We move about with our heads up and our eyes wide open, keeping to
our position but always ready to put brainwaves into action.''
Rijkaard takes up the story, stressing: ''We use the one formation,
3-4-3, and that makes integration into the senior team easier. Rinus
Michels and then Cruyff set this pattern and Ajax can field unknown
young players who fit in immediately.
''The real secret, though, is that they know the mechanism of the game
inside out.''
In the main, the club is a self-perpetuating organisation and others
come to buy from them. Indeed, it is highly likely that many of the
players who believe they will win on Wednesday will end up furthering
their careers in the Italian league, perhaps even one or two signing for
Milan.
Over the years Ajax have produced and sold some of the best players
ever seen including Cruyff, Neeskens, Rep, Krol, Kieft, Koeman, van
Basten, Rijkaard, back with them ironically after a successful spell
with Milan, Winter, Bergkamp, and Jonk, and the money generated has
helped finance the youth system and also the construction of the #100m
Ajax Stadium, scheduled for completion next summer.
They sense their time again has arrived and that they are only one
match short of completing a league season undefeated -- they beat their
great rivals, Feyenoord, 5-0 on Thursday night -- is a measure of their
well-being, but the European Cup would offer absolute proof.
And yet, their aim has always been a simple one. ''Making spectators
happy is vital to our survival,'' said club president Michael van Praag.
''I want to hear the team playing soccer music that delights our fans. I
want spectacular attacking football.''
Come Wednesday, I for one hope Ajax win because of what they represent
at both ends of the football spectrum. May they be in tune and may they
play Milan off the park.

Volleyball has a great many advantages over many a sport. All it takes
is a top, a pair of shorts, trainers, a ball, and a wee bit of netting
across a hall
BACK I am at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall, this time for the Glasgow City
European Club Volleyball Champions' Cup.
And very pleasant, too, it is. Hosted by the famed Su Ragazzi
volleyball club, the guests included teams from London, (Mallory, both
the men's and women's teams), and Manchester (Sale), Hungary,
represented by LRI Malev from Budapest, the Belgian Noliko Maaseik team,
and the Luxembourg international squad.
Luxembourg has long had an association with Scottish volleyball.
Scotland has competed regularly in the Four Nations tournament which the
Federation Luxumbourgoise de Volley-Ball holds and organises. Most
experienced player in the Luxembourg side is Claude Hoffman who, along
with Dimitri Bossen, plays with the national league champions, VC
Strassen.
Noliko Maaseik are a semi-professional Belgian club whose first visit
to Scotland this was, and are tough competitors. And the Hungarian Malev
side is somewhat of a legend.
Formed in 1946, it has more than 700 members, (bear in mind that
volleyball is perhaps the most popular participating sport in Hungary
with 10,000 regular practitioners), and the Malev club competes in nine
different sports including archery, basketball, football, and handball.
Sponsored by the Hungarian national airline, the team included two
international players, Csaba Borcsok and Attila Gyori, who between them
have amassed 447 international caps for Hungary.
I spoke to the team's giant middle hitter, an insurance executive from
Budapest, Gyorgy Ando. He told me that he was, in fact, a little on the
short side for his position. He is just under six feet six. Takes the
breath away.
A wee advantage I had was that I had a Hungarian grandfather and could
pronounce the lads names. For a start Gyorgy is pronounced ''George''.
Well George also told me that the high times for the popularity of
Hungarian volleyball was in the 1960s and '70s.
They are still a powerful volleyball nation and despite not making it
to the final this time around, will prove to be severe opponents in
Europe. In fact, tournament organiser and Glasgow Su Ragazzi team
manager Paul Landman, himself a planning official with Glasgow District
Council which did much of the sponsoring of the three-day weekend event,
told me that they were looking to pick up much of the European
expertise, especially from the East European club.
As it happened, however, the two teams in the men's final were both
British. The ubiquitous City of Glasgow Ragazzi versus the London-based
Mizuno Mallory, a rerun of last year's final, in which the London side
beat the Glasgow team. This year Ragazzi more than made up for last
year's narrow defeat, winning by 3-0 against the Londoners.
But, of course, there is ever women's volleyball, too, and most clubs
have both genders on their books.
Ragazzi are a case in point. In fact, Ragazzi means ''boys and
girls'', for ragazzo is Italian for boy and ragazza is such for girl.
The girls' Su Ragazzi team did not do as well as the boys but
considering that this is the first year it had an official ladies'
section it has much to look forward to, not the least being the influx
of younger girls from the schools where volleyball is at last beginning
to pick up.
The women's final starred Manchester's Sale club, and London Mallory.
As this was a round-robin competition, the sides got to play each other
twice, first on the Saturday, and then on Sunday.
Mallory are a vastly experienced side. Older -- and rather taller --
than their rivals in the final, Sale, they might well have been expected
to win. They did. The younger team (bear in mind that Sale have reached
nine out of the last 10 National Cup finals) summoned up last resources
only to lose in a thrilling game with Mallory beating the Mancunians in
a fifth set, what is called a tie-breaker, by 3-2.
In a tie-breaker each team gets a point for every rally, regardless of
which side has the ball. It is a little like penalty shoot-outs in
footy, and just as exciting. It was a close-run thing and Sale have
nothing to be ashamed of and weren't. Rather buoyant really at the end
of the match. Kim Glennon, a fitness instructor in Manchester, pointed
out that they were in with a chance right to the end. Seventeen-year-old
Philippa Lloyd, a PE student, said she enjoyed every minute anyway.
And Meliss Coutts, who hails from Morningside in Edinburgh (from
Firhill Secondary in fact, one expects posher from Morningside), said
one of the best things was the way the two young cadets, Karen Ingham
and Sue Hartley, played. It was true. It was a wonder to see the young
women learning at such a level.
But there were a lot of people there at the weekend.
I met John Carden again, he of the Jinty McGinty team. Since Jinty
started sponsoring this west-end of Glasgow club a mere two years ago,
Jinty has managed to get the side winning the fourth division
championship this year which is no mean achievement.
Volleyball has a great many advantages over many a sport. All it takes
is a top, a pair of shorts, trainers, a ball, and a wee bit of netting
across a hall.
Sure, it takes a bit more -- the Hungarians for instance had to pay a
lot of the travel expenses themselves -- but every sport, as in a hobby
if it comes to that, costs the participants. It is a small price to pay
for so much fun at that.

IT would be churlish and petty to make any chauvinist remarks about
the 1300 ladies who competed in the Glasgow women's 10-kilometre race.
So there will be no remarks here about some of the competitors going
so slow and chatting so much that it looked like aerobic gossiping
instead of running. No expressions of surprise that the gels managed the
course without a single make-up repair station.
We will not comment on the lycra, though there was enough of it on
show to cheer up even the most disinterested passer-by on Great Western
Road. Nor shall we mention the many substantial chests which no sports
bra yet invented could quieten. Such was the concentration of billowing
bosoms at one point that we were overcome with a dizziness not unlike
seasickness.
No, we will not mention any of that kind of stuff. Let us concentrate
on the home team's success in the race against competition from all over
Britain. Glasgow athlete Vicky McPherson came first and the Scottish
team won the international section.
Jenny Wood Allan, of Dundee, came in towards the end in a very slow
time of one hour and 20 minutes. But she is 84-years-old and didn't take
up running until she was 70.
Jenny was followed in by two young things wearing T-shirts with the
words ''Tanecastle girls do it'' and the word ''eventually'' on the
back.
We were pleased to see a spot of behaviour by some of the runners that
the lads would would have been poud of. A bunch of nurses ran under the
team name the Southern General Swallyers. Anita Manning, of West End
Auctions, who, as Scotland's first lady auctioneer, is usually never
short of puff, put her mid-race difficulty down to too many gins on the
Saturday night.
And what was all that male piggery at the beginning? Sheer jealousy.
If some of the ladies were to deliver a well-deserved thick ear, the
Diary couldn't run away to save itself.
* THE Diary has this theory that in every football-playing city on
earth, and probably on all the planets in all the galaxies, there is a
Partick Thistle.
Teams who are overshadowed by their big neighbours. Teams who appeal
to fans with dogged determination, a sense of humour, and an ability to
cope with meagre rations of success.
A postcard from Brian D Finch, a Jags man currently residing in
Greece, informs us that the Peloponnesian version of Partick Thistle is
a team called Sparti. Or Spartick Thistle as he prefers to call them.
He recently saw them play Hania of Crete. The Spartick winger left the
Hania keeper and defence stranded with a beautifully flighted cross only
to see his two strikers collide and crumple to the ground. ''Just like
the good old days at the Jags,'' he says.
''During the second half, the Sparti No.6, a sort of Mediterranean
Chick Charnlizos, had nine policemen ask him to stop hitting the referee
and leave the pitch.'' Spartick lost 2-0, which everyone present blamed
on the referee being a Turk.
When Mr Finch explains to the Greek fans that he supports Partick
Thistle, the inevitable ask: ''Who?'' He patiently explains about Celtic
being a Catholic team and Rangers being Protestant. ''I tell them that
Thistle are Glasgow's Orthodox team which seems to go down well with the
locals and gets me free drink.''
He was less welcome when in, his kilt, he attended the European
qualifiying match between Greece and Russia. He was summarily ejected
for laughing when the Greek goalie fumbled the ball.
* THE Name Game: A chap who has made bit of a name for himself as a
visual historian and artist on the subject of golf in St Andrews is a Mr
Putter.
* FOR any lucky people heading off to South Africa for the Rugby World
Cup, we have been asked to recommend Willie John's, a pub in
Johannesburg. It is jointly Irish and Scottish run and will be offering
all sorts of entertainment, including pipe bands, Irish folk, and male
voice choirs. On the days when there are no matches, golfing, visits to
the horse-racing, and safaris are being laid on.
Drink will be international and plentiful and food ranging from Scotch
broth to Irish stew to potkie. The last one is an African stew.
So why are we singling out one pub in the whole of South Africa?
Because his mum asked us to.

KEN GALLACHER must live in a world of his own if on Sunday ''most of
the nation spent yesterday afternoon gathered round television sets'' to
see the outcome of the FA Premiership struggle between Blackburn Rovers
and Manchester United.
There was no terrestrial television coverage of the matches at

I RECENTLY refereed at the Isle of Mull seven-a-side tournament at
which I've officiated for a number of years.
Sixteen male and eight female teams from as far flung as Bristol to as
near but cosmopolitan as Craigielians of Paisley come together for a day
of serious competitive rugby, played in tremendous spirit in front of a
good-humoured but knowledgeable crowd (who are never short of suitable
advice to the teams and to the refs, with regard to where our whistles
may finish up!).
The location of the clubhouse and pitches must be the most picturesque
and beautiful in the northern hemisphere, looking out on to the Sound of
Mull.
When the rugby is over, the real fun begins with a ceilidh in the
clubhouse till the small hours where the finer points of the day's play
are discussed over the odd dozen beers.
In these days of semi-professionalism running parallel with 'The Ego
Has Landed' officialism, win at all costs mentality, this tournament
reminds me why I am still involved in our wonderful sport.
Get in contact with Duncan Swinbanks, the Corinthian honorary
secretary of Mull, whom I'm sure would welcome you next year (if you fit
the bill and your name's not Carling or Moore!).

I HAVE a jaded view of all the recent weeping and wailing from
supporters of Scotland's relegated clubs. At least they have a team to
watch next season, unlike the Meadowbank supporters like myself who went
to Greenock on Saturday.
It is not a pleasant experience to see your team's last ever match,
and I, for one, feel bitterly let down that the football establishment
has allowed a megalomanic club owner to take out a franchise on one of
Scotland's clubs, change its name, and move it to Livingston.
Bill Hunter and his cronies may feel they have won their battle, but
don't forget they have been abject failures in Edinburgh, driving away
supporters, sending the team spiralling down the leagues, and even
masterminding a share issue that saw just half a dozen people putting
money into the club.
If Scottish football is in crisis at the top, you better believe it is
rotten to the core down below. Livingston -- you have been warned.

OLD Firm fan Hugh McMenemy (May 18), in attempting to defend his
club's incompetence on match tickets, descended to sneers about the size
of Partick Thistle's support. Unfortunately, such a line of thought
leads inevitably to the embarrassing question of why these two
particular clubs attract larger gates.
Just what is that special magic which the Jags are missing?
Thistle fans are fewer in number; usually this exasperates. However,
when glory occasionally comes our way, it is a glory free from the
baggage and taint of bigotry. Our friends who support the Old Firm will
never experience this, which is why Jags fans will always feel sorry for
them.

TEN out of ten for your very full and comprehensive coverage of the
weekend's Scottish athletics programme, particularly the results of the
various Scottish District Championships.
Held over two days at three separate venues, with five age-groups in
both male and female categories, and as many as 14 events per age group,
made full coverage a massive undertaking.
However, every relevant detail was given. Congratulations are in order
for the compiler's patience and expertise.
The whole weekend package was then highlighted in an excellent,
well-informed article by Doug Gillon.
Add to that the results of the Scottish National 10K road race, five
other road races, a hill race, a multi-terrain event and you have
coverage of Scottish athletics second to none.
While I have singled out this weekend's reports, it is really the
consistency of in-depth athletics coverage that prompts my letter.

BOTH the Scottish and English Football Association did the same thing
on the last weekend of the season and one must wonder what would have
happened if they had been caught out.
The SFA presented Raith Rovers with the first division trophy at
Firhill, so what would they have done if Raith had lost and Dunfermline
had won the title, quite a few miles away? Then, on Sunday the English
association presented Blackburn Rovers with the Premiership trophy at
Liverpool, so what would they have done had Manchester United scored in
the last minute to take the title at West Ham in London some 200 miles
away? Did both FAs have a helicopter on standby in case of emergency, or
were the trophies presented not the real thing, with one at each game?

WHILE some of Scotland's most famous football clubs have been toiling
to stay in the premier division this year, things have been just as
tough for the newcomers further down the divisions.
But it's been a good year for the most northerly senior team. Much
better than many had anticipated. When Ross County came into the third
division, few gave them much hope of success. Instead, all the
expectations for the year centred on their local rivals, Caledonian
Thistle, who joined the Scottish League at the same time. But it's a
funny old game, football.
The manager of the Dingwall team, Bobby Wilson, and his players have
given their vociferous supporters plenty to cheer about, almost as much
as their record victory last year, 11-0, over unfortunate St Cuthbert
Wanderers in a Scottish Cup tie. For many it must have brought back
memories of another famous Scottish Cup run.
As minnows in 1966, Ross County disposed of Forfar and Alloa, before
welcoming bigger fish to Victoria Park. A crowd of 8000 turned up and
Rangers headed south afterwards, grateful, with a 2-0 victory.
Wilson has been at the club since 1987. When he arrived they were
languishing at the bottom of the league, but things have changed
dramatically and, under his leadership, County have enjoyed a revival
and have run amok in Highland competitions. He has been pleasantly
surprised by how well his team have adapted to the rough and tumble of
the third division.
''At first there were some rumblings among the locals about us leaving
the Highland League. But we had done all there was to do there and the
only way forward was to move to the Scottish League,'' he said.
''There's not much point in defending in those circumstances, so we
set out to play attractive football and entertain the fans. I just told
the players that they were going to play 36 cup-ties.
''One of our problems is that we're a small team. The high
expectations about Caley partly arose because they're a big, strong
team. For us there was no point in putting the ball 16 feet in the air
up the park . . . especially to 5ft 3in strikers.''
But as the season progressed, it was Ross County who were not only
surviving, but in the race for promotion. As the push for the second
division gathered speed, so the crowds flowed into Victoria Park to
watch ''Jimmy Shand's XI,'' and even at away ties there was often a
travelling support of between 200 and 250, no mean feat when at some
other matches in the division the crowd would barely fill a telephone
kiosk. The club travelled more than 6000 miles in their bid for glory.
Eventually, the battle for promotion was lost on the cruellest
battlefields at a ''Highland Firm'' match in Inverness with two players
being sent off in a 3-0 defeat. But Wilson says there's plenty to be
proud of and with a 1200-seater stand costing #500,000 due for
completion in July the prospects look good.
''In some ways I have mixed feelings about not getting promoted.
Although everyone was disappointed, especially having got so near, it
might have been too much pressure too soon,'' he said.
There was some talk of an interesting transfer earlier in the season.
With Eric Cantona having his troubles in the south following his clash
with a Crystal Palace fan, it was suggested in a local paper that he was
planning a move north to Dingwall. On April 1, the telephone lines were
jammed as eager supporters called to verify the report. Denials followed
until one caller was told that a deal hadn't yet been signed as the
volatile Frenchman hadn't had the opportunity to examine the height of
the wall.
Wilson has paid tribute to the warmth of the local support for the
team, although some of the more optimistic ones, presumably those for
whom there is no night, believe that a path to Europe lies ahead. Who
knows, maybe Eric the Red will really be free to play for them by then.

FORMER England manager Bobby Robson made a brief return from exile
last week and talked some good sense about the state of the game.
Robson was in London to toast the English Football Writers'
Association at their Player of the Year dinner, paying tribute
ironically to some of the men who made his life a torment when he was
national team manager.
But he did not take the opportunity to revenge himself on those who
helped send him into soccer exile.
Instead, he talked like an elder statesman, about the problems in the
game and the sleaze factor which has struck football south of the Border
during his absence. Above all, though, he defended his fellow managers.
He pointed out: ''There have been 50 managers sacked in England this
season. That is wrong and chairmen should start to take a look at
themselves.''
Robson sympathised with the likes of Trevor Francis (Sheffield
Wednesday), Alan Smith (Crystal Palace), and Brian Horton (Manchester
City), who were among the latest managerial casualties.
Robson was clearly pointing out to directors that they must take
responsibility, that they should not simply react to the lynch-mob
mentality which causes managers to be ruthlessly cast aside.
He talks from experience. In one slight dig at the writers who so
often derided him, he said: ''At Porto, where I'm now manager, the
players call me Mister. So here I am, having gone from plonker to Mister
to guest of honour.''
The last tag was the one which suited Robson most. He came across as a
man of undoubted honour.
He even took time to praise the investigative journalists who have
uncovered scandals in English football.
He said: ''The press can be a pest. But they have been able to winkle
out problems in the game and they have to be commended for that.''
It was a compliment, indeed, from a man who was so often the butt of
journalists when he was in charge of England.
Since leaving that job, that thankless job, Robson has proved himself
all over again. The man who guided unfashionable Ipswich to domestic
success, and to so much European glory, has continued his winning ways.
Twice he won the Dutch championship with PSV Eindhoven. Now, he has
taken the Portuguese title with Porto.
The record is impressive.
Robson was sacked at Sporting Lisbon despite success with the club.
He has suffered just as the 50 managers in England have suffered this
season.
But Robson matured as a manager in a different time.
He recalled his former Ipswich chairman John Cobbold's comments to him
while he was manager there.
''The game is more important than winning,'' said Cobbold.
It is a remark which should be read, and assimilated by the
Thatcherites who now inhabit the game and who have taken over so many
boardrooms.
Robson clearly still believes in that Corinthian example.
Cobbold, like Robson himself, still wanted success. There was no
doubting that. But a ''win at all costs'' philosophy was not the way for
either of them.
Nor would Cobbold ever have given in to fans who demonstrated at the
front door of his club.
Once, when asked if there was a crisis at Ipswich, the patrician
Cobbold answered: ''I think there was a crisis once. We ran out of
Chablis in the boardroom.''
That was the way it was then, a better way, a way that Robson
remembers the game.
Free of sleaze, free of scandal, and free of the ruthless men-in-suits
who have sacked 50 managers and who will sack even more in the future.
Robson emerged last week as a spokesman for all managers. It seems a
pity that his experience, and his stature, is lost to the English game
while he pursues his career in Europe.
There should have been a place for him somewhere in soccer's corridors
of power.
He is a man who remains passionate about the game, but, also, a man
who thinks deeply not only about how the game is played but also how the
people in the game should behave.
He stood there, alongside the Player of the Year Jurgen Klinsmann, and
the German player applauded him.
Perhaps Robson had to go abroad to earn the respect. But it is a
respect which he now has among his peers, among the managers and the
players, and, yes, even the journalists.
One can only hope that the chairmen listened to his words, and
considered them, and realised that every manager should be given a
proper chance to do his job without boardroom interference, and with
real support instead of the hollow words which are so often the norm.
It is a respect which he now has among his peers, among the managers
and the players, and, yes, even the journalists.
Robson emerged last week as a spokesman for all managers. It seems a
pity that his experience is lost to the English game.

A PAR at the long third brought a mammoth battle in the Scottish
Women's Amateur Golf Championship final to a close on Saturday with
Longniddry's young pretender, Hilary Monaghan, running out a narrow
victor at the twenty-first hole against the more experienced Sharon
McMaster.
The 20-year-old had fought back from a three-hole deficit to lead --
only to almost surrender the title with some nervous play on and around
the quick linksland greens.
Such play brought a bogey on the sixteenth and a one-hole lead for her
Dunbar opponent. A birdie on the short seventeenth squared the match
again, yet Monaghan missed birdie putts to win on the first two extra
holes.
But a No.6 iron to five feet at what was to be the last hole gave her
a par and victory as McMaster made bogey, a bitter blow for the
34-year-old internationalist.
* JIM Colbert had five birdies over an eight-hole stretch yesterday as
his putter carried him to the championship of the Bell Atlantic Classic
in Pennsylvania, his third title this year.
Colbert's two-under-par 68 gave him a 207 total, one shot better than
J C Snead, the leader for the first two rounds at the Chester Valley
club. He had a 70 to finish one shot ahead of Jack Nicklaus, who had a
final-round 68.
The first prize of $135,000 raised Colbert's 1995 earnings to
$666,498. He remains second on the money list behind Ray Floyd by just
over $1000.
Britain's Tony Jacklin withdrew after a second-round 81. Leading
scores:
207 -- J Colbert 68, 71, 68. 208 -- J C Snead 66, 72, 70. 209 -- J

213 -- L Trevino 69, 72, 72.
* JULIE Inkster fired a second-round 68, four under par, for a
two-round aggregate of 137 and a three-shot lead in the $500,000 Star
Bank LPGA Classic in Dayton, Ohio. Scotland's Catriona Matthew was 10
shots adrift. Leading scores (Americans unless stated):

74. Failed to qualkify: 154 -- P Wright (Scotland) 77, 77.
* TORRENTIAL rain washed out the final round of the $920,000 Japan
Pepsi-Ube Kosan tournament in Achisu yesterday. Third-round leader
Mitutaka Kusakabe was declared the winner.
Shropshire's Jonathan Lomas was 10 shots adrift. He had carded a 74
for a one-under-par total of 216.
* DEFENDING champion Vicki Thomas led the qualifiers into the knockout
phase of the Welsh Women's Championship over Aberdovey today.
The 40-year-old former Curtis Cup star from the Pennard Club in
Swansea began her bid for a record ninth title with rounds of 76 and 72
for a 36-hole aggregate of 148.

BARCLAY Howard emerged from a slight slump to finish top Scot in the
English Strokeplay championship at Hillside yesterday.
In the process, the Cochrane Castle player reminded watching Walker
Cup selectors he is still very much in contention for the biennial match
against America at Royal Porthcawl in September.
Howard moved into contention with a fine third round 69, three under
par, and followed up with a 71 to be four behind Bath's Colin Edwards,
who equalled the amateur course record yesterday to tie for first place
with Worksop's Mark Foster.
Edwards' 67 was last matched by Ryder Cup player Paul Way in 1981 when
the then amateur won the prestigous Brabazon Trophy.
Overnight challenger Hugh McKibbin, the Scottish Amateur champion from
Troon Welbeck, slipped back with disappointing closing rounds of 75 and
76. Leading scores:
283 -- C Edwards (Bath) 73, 73, 70, 67; M Foster (Worksop) 69, 73, 70,
71.
285 -- D Howell (Broome Manor) 70, 71, 73, 71.

288 -- D Lynn (Trentham) 76, 71, 69, 72; S Griffiths (Wentworth) 71,
74, 71, 72; M Wheelhouse (New Zealand) 72, 73, 71, 72; M Cort (Birtall)
70, 75, 72, 71; G Clark (Pinner Hill) 69, 75, 71, 73.
Other scores included: 294 -- A Reid (Kilmarnock Barassie) 72, 76, 72,
74. 297 -- H McKibbbin (Troon Welbeck) 76, 70, 75, 76. 299 -- B Collier
(Callander) 70, 77, 74, 78.
* BATHGATE'S Stephen Gallacher suffered a singles defeat for Lothians
in their match against Stirlingshire at Glenbervie yesterday in the Area
Team championship as the holders opened with a 5[1/2]-3[1/2] victory.
Gallacher, taking a break from the more intense English Strokeplay
championships at Hillside, notched up a comfortable morning foursomes
win alongside Brian Shields, but went down to Helensburgh's Peter
Haggarty by 3 and 2 in his afternoon tie.
Ayrshire continued their poor form in this event, going down
6[1/2]-2[1/2] Largs with three-times Scottish Boys' champion Steven
Young, of Inverallochy, running out double victor.
The finalists of the Scottish Amateur Championship in 1991, Graham
Lowson of Crieff and Len Salariya of Downfield, were pitted against each
other in the morning foursomes of the Perth and Kinross versus Angus
match. Again Lowson triumphed, at the twenty-second hole. His side were
not so successful, however, losing 5-4. Results:
Stirlingshire 3[1/2], Lothians 5[1/2], at Glenbervie; Argyll and Bute
2[1/2], North-East 6[1/2], at Largs; Ayrshire 2[1/2], North-East 6[1/2],
at Largs; Perth and Kinross 4, Angus 5, at Kinross; North 6,
Renfrewshire 3, at Nairn; Lanarkshire 6[1/2], Dumbartonshire 2[1/2], at

SPANISH OPEN
SEVE Ballesteros, despite having bogeys at each of the first three
holes yesterday, put in a storming finish to win the Spanish Open for
the third time in Madrid.
Ballesteros snatched three birdies in his last seven holes, including
one at the eighteenth before a massed gallery, to gain his fifty-fifth
European Tour victory -- and seventy-second worldwide -- by two strokes.
The 38-year-old Spanish maestro finished with a 71 for a four-round
aggregate of 274, 14 under par, and led home a Spanish Armada of Jose
Rivero and Ignacio Garrido, who were joint second on 276.
Peter Baker, the 27-year-old Wolverhampton golfer who hopes to make a
late run for a Ryder Cup place, and Scot Gordon Brand Jr, who had led
overnight, finished joint fourth on 277, with Londoner Peter Mitchell
and Argentinian Eduardo Romero sharing sixth place one shot further
back.
But Ballesteros could hardly have written a better script. He had
begun the day one shot behind Brand, but after the first two holes, was
three behind. The thousands massing behind the ropes to watch their idol
groaned, but they need not have worried.
After his third successive bogey at the third, Ballesteros began the
long haul back. He birdied the fourth to turn in 38, two over par, at
which point Rivero, Garrido, and Baker had all caught him and Brand,
also out in 38, was still one ahead.
But Brand began to fade, Rivero, Garrido and Baker all came home in
35, and Mitchell, who was also level with Ballesteros after 16 holes,
ruined his chance with a double-bogey 5 at the short seventeenth.
Ballesteros birdied the twelfth and fifteenth to move one stroke ahead
of the field and came to the last needing a par 4 for victory.
Typically, he was on in two and knocked in a five-foot putt for a birdie
3.
Despite his victory, Ballesteros admitted he did not play well,
saying: ''I had a bad start and I was feeling very uncomfortable with my
swing. But I just had to convince myself I had to get on with it with
what I had.
''The people of Madrid were magnificent and supported me all the way.
I have never seen so many people at a Spanish event before, and though
winning is always important it was a very important week for Spanish
golf with Rivero and Garrido right behind me.''
No Spaniard had won this title since Ballesteros had the second of two
previous victories in 1985. He had also won in 1981.
Asked how he had felt after dropping three shots in the first three
holes, he said: ''I told myself I had to make birdies at all the
par-fives and I would be one under.
''Well, I got one at the fourth and missed it at the seventh so I said
'Make two birdies in the last nine and you can still win', and I got
three.''
Ballesteros is now 171,340 points ahead of his nearest rival, Italian
Costantino Rocca, in the Ryder Cup points table.
Baker, who has not been playing well, made a late run in 1993 to get
into the Ryder Cup by winning both the Scandinavian Masters and the
Dunhill Masters that year.
He said: ''I've got to be up and running to get into the team again,
but this week has been encouraging.''
Brand led by one shot overnight but fell away with a 75 today. He
said: ''I played well enough but could get nothing in on the greens.''
Bernhard Langer finished joint-eighth on 279 while Colin Montgomerie
and Jose Maria Olazabal were joint-fifteenth on 281.
A further 15 strokes adrift was Scotland's Steve McAllister who had a
disastrous final two rounds. After having been on the leaderboard with
opening rounds of 69 and 67, he then followed up with two 80s.

England camp, Durban, Sunday
ENGLAND captain Will Carling has warned his team-mates he wants no big
heads in the team when the World Cup extravaganza begins this week.
Carling's men face Argentina, Italy and Western Samoa in their group
and he said: ''If we are relaxed or conceited we could lose one or two
of those games.''
England are expected to qualify for the knock-out stages as group
leaders, but Carling insists that England's pool is ''the group of
death'' rather than the section containing Australia, South Africa,
Canada and Romania which has already been given the lurid tag.
There are only two feasible qualifiers from the Cape Town group --
hosts South Africa and holders Australia. In real terms, Canada and
Romania are already dead.
But with two of the four to go through, any of the other three in
England's pool could qualify for the quarter-finals.
Carling said: ''I don't care who comes second so long as we are first.
It is the toughest pool because nobody can predict confidently who will
be second, even given that we win.
''I don't believe any of our opponents will be playing their reserves
against us in the belief that they are going to lose anyway.
''They will be up for the task of beating England because that would
be an incredible boost for all of them.
''Argentina have one of the best scrums in the tournament, Italy are
skilful and the Samoans physically powerful.''
England trained again today in roasting Durban heat after a wasted,
but necessary, day spent flying to and from Cape Town for the welcome
lunch.
It lashed with rain in Cape Town and the aircraft home dropped
abruptly 1000 feet, giving the English and Welsh squads a nasty scare
before a safe landing.
Dean Richards again came off during training to rest his nagging
hamstring and manager Jack Rowell does not want to be confronted with
the unexpected problem of the player reporting unfit when the team is
named on Tuesday for Saturday's opener against Argentina.
Rowell, though, has good t back-up and said: ''Richards says he will
be fit within a couple of days. If he cannot make it I am not too
concerned.
''We would move Ben Clarke from flanker to No 8 -- a position in which
he is world class. I would like to see Ben at No 8 anyway just to liven
Dean up.
''To replace Ben on the open-side flank we would have Steve Ojomoh or
Neil Back. However, Richards is someone we do need on the big England
days.''
Today was only the second full day England have spent in Durban,
despite arriving on Thursday, and they made solid use of it with the
longest training session that any of the players can remember --
two-and-a-half hours.
Australia have decided not to risk Tim Horan in the opening match of
their World Cup defence against South Africa in Newlands on Thursday.
Coach Bob Dwyer has named a virtually unchanged side from the one that
defeated Argentina 30-13 in Sydney earlier this month, with 21-year-old
Daniel Herbert partnering Jason Little in the centre.
The outstanding Horan has been battling his way back from a serious
knee injury, suffered in the Super 10 final a year ago, but Dwyer has
opted to save him for the later matches against Canada or Romania.
''We felt he hadn't given us any indication he could put the other two
out,'' said Dwyer. ''He'll get his chances anyway and we're comfortable
with the form of the other two.
''The likelihood is that everyone will play at least once in the pool
games.''
Willie Ofahengaue has edged out Troy Coker on the blindside with prop
Dan Crowley preferred to Tony Daly.
Rod McCall's inclusion at lock, despite recent ankle problems, means
there are eight survivors from the side that beat England 12-6 in the
1991 final at Twickenham.
With the exception of Crowley, the pack is identical to the one which
helped trounce the Springboks by a record 26-3 margin at Newlands in
1992.

that would be an incredible boost for all of them'

LORA Fairclough from Lancashire completed a second Tour victory when
she fashioned an impressive closing round of 68 to win the Ford Classic
at Chart Hills in Kent yesterday.
She finished with an 11-under-par total of 277, one clear of Florence
Descampe from Belgium with Sweden's Carin Hjalmarsson third on 281.
Dale Reid was the best of the Scots. In the third round she
established a course record with a brilliant 66. Yesterday she added a
71 to share fourth place with Laura Davies, who conjured two eagles in a
closing 69.
It was Reid who chaperoned Fairclough to two wins in the Solheim Cup
match last year against the United States. Yesterday they were playing
in the same threesome.
Fairclough had started the final round one stroke behind Descampe but
gathered three birdies in her first five holes on her way to the turn in
33 to move three ahead.
Descampe then reeled off three birdies in a row from the twelfth to
reduce her deficit to just one, Fairclough having to follow her into the
hole from 18 feet for a matching birdie at the thirteenth.
In the two previous rounds Fairclough had struggled over the closing
holes but with the title beckoning she made no mistake this time.
The green at the short seventeenth is an elusive target with
intimidating water close at hand, but Fairclough, to her relief, struck
a superb No.6 iron safely on to the green.
Cheered home by large crowds Fairclough then played another flawless
stroke with her No.8 iron to 15 feet at the final hole for a 4 which
added the title to the IBM Open she won in Sweden two years ago.
Reid had been in third place when, after turning in 35, she birdied
the long twelfth, but a double bogey 6 at the fifteenth halted her run.
There she drove into the trees from where she had to play out backwards.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
277 -- L Fairclough 70, 68, 71, 68 (#16,500).
278 -- F Descampe (Belgium) 69, 67, 72, 70 (#11,125).

IN seven holes yesterday, the Buick Classic at Westchester went from
being a walkover for Nick Faldo to a long sudden-death play-off finish
between two golfers, neither of them Faldo.
Vijay Singh, who won here in a play-off in 1993, went to extra holes
with first-round leader Doug Martin. After four play-off holes, all
halved with pars, the two went to the par-4 eighteenth, where Singh won
by holing a 10-footer for his only birdie of the day.
After 11 holes yesterday Faldo was at eight under par, two ahead of
Singh. He bogeyed four of the next six during which it was hard to
isolate a single good shot or a lucky result.
When it was noted that Faldo was one of the last players expected to
collapse down the stretch, he replied: ''It's all human out there, isn't
it?''
Singh had previously won 17 world-wide titles, including this one in
1993 and the Phoenix Open in January, both in sudden-death. Leading
scores (Americans unless stated):
278 -- D Martin 67, 70, 72, 69; V Singh (Fiji) 70, 69, 67, 72.
279 -- B Wadkins 72, 66, 69, 72.
280 -- N Faldo (England) 70, 70, 68, 72; E Els (S Africa) 68, 69, 75,
68; D Pruitt 72, 69, 70, 69; F Funk 71, 68, 71, 70.
Other score: 289 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 74, 71, 70, 74.

We are a young team and not used to participating in an event such as
this. We don't have very much international experience either, so we
approach the games with some trepidation.
In Rustenburg
THEY have only 15 rugby clubs and 2700 players, and just 22 years ago
when the Federation Ivorienne de Rugby was formed, there was just one
rugby ball in the country.
The Ivory Coast are the Cinderellas of world rugby but, just like
Cinders, they shall go to the ball.
The Elephants, as the West Africans are known, have already staged one
major upset by qualifying for the World Cup as African Zone winners
ahead of the likes of Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Morocco.
Scotland open their World Cup campaign against the Ivoriennes on
Friday when, if the Africans' training session yesterday in Rustenburg
was a true guide to form, the splendidly appointed stadium in this
sleepy rural town at the heart of the Transvaal tobacco and platinum
mining industries should become the Elephants' graveyard.
Nevertheless, as Ivory Coast captain Athanase Dali, declared
yesterday: ''We want to prove that we have a right to be here. We were
the surprise qualifiers, ahead of Morocco and Zimbabwe. People have said
that we did not merit a place in the finals, but we want to prove them
all wrong. We want to show them that rugby is alive and well on the
Ivory Coast.''
Football is the prime sport there, rugby being a legacy of French
colonial rule, and 12 of the 26-strong Ivorienne squad play their rugby
in France.
The media liaison officer with the party, Christian Lescure, was more
realistic about his side's chances in the competition. ''Our hopes are
to participate honourably. If we can do that then we will be happy,'' he
said.
The captain, Dali, is an interesting character. It was his father,
Francois, who introduced the game to the Africans of Ivory Coast --
hitherto it had been a pastime for French expatriates -- and 22 years
later they are the first purely black African side to reach the World
Cup finals.
Dali, a scrum half and fly-half who will fill the latter role during
the World Cup, is a law graduate from a Paris university. However, he
soon tired of the law and decided, instead, to become a journalist. He
attended a post-graduate media course in Paris where he now lives, and
is now a busy freelance, working for the likes of L'Equipe, Midi
L'Olympique, and the French TV station TF1.
The Scotland group, with Tonga and France making up the other nations
involved, is a tough one for the Ivoriennes.
Dali said: ''Scotland and France are two of the best teams in the
world. France were World Cup finalists in 1987 and Scotland have also
done well in 1987 and 1991. These will be very difficult games for us.
''We are a young team and not used to participating in an event such
as this. We don't have very much international experience either, so we
approach the games with some trepidation.
''The thing that we have to do is to play a good game and, as I have
said, show that we merit a place in the competition.
''But we hope, too, that we can pose problems for these great teams.
In the Ivory Coast, football is the No.1 game. If we can do well here
then it will help rugby back home.
''We do not even get much coverage in the newspapers and television,
but if we can play respectably then maybe that will change, too.''
There is a suggestion that the Ivoriennes qualified for the finals
because they were underestimated by the African zone favourites, Namibia
and Zimbabwe. Both nations fielded second-string sides and paid the cost
accordingly.
It is this slur to which Dali refers when he castigates the critics
who say that the Ivoriennes have no right to be here in South Afica with
the world's best.
Here they are, though, and determined to give it their best shot. Some
of their qualifying matches were disfigured by unruly behaviour.
Ivorienne temperament is, at best, suspect.
The match against Scotland is a 30,000 sell-out. Dali hopes for a
good, clean game in which his side can display the same audacity and
flair which has put black African soccer sides on the world map.
And the Ivoriennes have another motive, too, for wanting to cause a
few upsets and announce their arrival on the world stage with a
flourish. In a country where the average monthly wage stands at around
#35, the #25-a-day tour allowance represents an African prince's ransom.
For the Ivoriennes, as the big players on the world stage talk of
professionalism and big buck deals, that tour allowance alone means they
have arrived. They have seen the pot of gold at the end of the rugby
rainbow. They like it, and they would dearly like some more.

GOEIE More to you all, as we say here in downtown Pretoria. The
linguists at Bridgehaugh will, of course, not require a translation but,
for the rest of you, that's Afrikaaner for good morning.
Play rugby and see the world. It fair broadens the mind!
We are now into Day Five of our World Cup campaign but so far, with
our first game against Ivory Coast -- or Ivory Coats as the
non-linguists in the party call them -- it has just been the phoney war.
We arrived early on Wednesday morning to be greeted by the pipes and
drums in the foyer of our hotel. It's amazing that, wherever we go, our
hosts seem able to whip up a pipe band at just a moment's notice. It was
nice touch and one appreciated by the boys.
The flight, courtesy of South African airways, took us to Pretoria by
the scenic route. We were in the air and on the road for 22 hours. Our
fitness expert, David McLean, left Scotland 10 hours after us and
arrived in Pretoria just after we did.
We stopped off in Munich where we were joined by the French squad and
were treated to a Bavarian meal by the German Rugby Federation.
And here was me thinking that a Bavarian meal was something that you
got for stomach ulcers!
* I AM rooming in our hotel with Chic Chalmers. The rest of the guys
have nicknamed the room the Temple of Self-Belief!
This period before the first game may be the phoney war but I have had
a battle of my own to contend with.
We did a light training session on Wednesday afternoon and that was
fine. The next day, though, as we were doing 100 metre sprints down at
the Pretoria Harlequins ground I felt a tingling sensation in the lower
back.
At first I thought nothing of it but, when it didn't get any better, I
mentioned it to Gavin Hastings and he said that none of us was to take
any chances.
I saw the team physio, James Robson, that night and he diagnosed a
slight strain to the left hamstring. I was severely fed up because I'm
not usually troubled by hamstring problems. Additionally, due to our
Five Nations' campaign, the game against Romania, and the
acclimatisation tour in Spain, we are fitter than we have ever been.
I took no further part in the twice-a-day training sessions and just
worked out with James.
By yesterday, I was beginning to get really worried. The leg didn't
feel any better and I was genuinely concerned that I was going to be in
trouble.
Now, though, the hamstring feels much easier and I'm confident that
I'll be fit for selection when the team to play Ivory Coast is announced
tonight.
* SATURDAY was a bit of a grind. All 16 teams, spread out all over
this huge country, had to fly to Cape Town for the opening lunch.
We left the hotel at 7am and motored to Johannesburg where we caught
the plane for the two-and-a-half-hour flight to Cape Town. When I say
''we'' that is we all left the hotel in the team bus, all except Bryan
Redpath and Craig Joiner. ''Basil'' and ''Jackie'', who are rooming
together, missed the bus and followed on with a police escort at
break-neck speed.
As it happened they wouldn't have missed much. When we landed at Cape
Town there was another one-and-a-half hour bus journey to a specially
erected marquee where lunch was served and there was much speechifying.
And all the time the rain just poured down.
By the time lunch was over the water was seeping up through the
carpets and the Welsh and Irish sides were soaked as it lashed in
through the marquee.
Like all of the other teams who are based hundreds of miles from Cape
Town, we had to leave early to catch our flight back to Pretoria. At
this point the lunch turned into a take-away.
We had our pudding on the way out the door and, courtesy of Jeremy
Richardson who had the presence of mind to grab a basket of goodies as
we were exiting stage-left, we ate our cheese and biscuits on the bus.
All that and we never even got to see Table Mountain.
I'm assured it was there but with the rain and the fog we couldn't see
beyond a couple of feet in front of our noses.
* THE major talking point among the players now is who will be in the
team for Friday. It's a difficult choice for the selectors.
Bearing in mind what happened in Spain when the midweek side didn't
perform too cleverly against Madrid Select, we really want to get the
show on the road with a top performance.
That could mean that the top team is picked. However, if that happens,
then the same side would probably have to play against both Tonga and
the French.
I'm desperate to get a game against the Ivory Coast and, hopefully,
the waiting will be over tomorrow once the selectors have done their
work.
Totsiens. Sien jou weer. Which, as the Bridgehaugh linguists will be
only too pleased to tell you, translates as cheerio, see you soon.

AFTER two days on the high seas, piracy within yards of the harbour
wall at Troon Yacht Haven grabbed overall victory in the Isle of Jura
Scottish Peaks Race yesterday.
As the race leader, Oban-based Two Hoots, struggled to negotiate the
entry channel against the elements, Eos, from Skelmorlie, hugged the
shore, stole right of way, and tacked in under the bows of her rival,
winning by just two boat-lengths after 160 miles of sailing.
But if Eos, or Eos Mantua Surgelati, to give her full title, owed
ultimate success to the buccaneering helmsmanship of John Fitzgerald, it
was a team effort by skipper Adrian Venzo and Paul Jeffes, plus the
inspirational running of Dermot McGonigle and Robbie Bryson, which made
it possible.
These two mountain whippets negotiated some 18 miles of bog, scree,
and torrent on the Paps of Jura by the light of Davy-lamp style helmets,
twice restoring their team to the lead after it had been surrendered on
the water.
Eos was the first monohull to win since 1988, and the two runners took
the King of the Bens title, for the fastest cumulative ascents of Ben
More, Paps of Jura, and Goat Fell -- some 55 miles of running and 11,000
feet of climbing.
Shettleston Harrier McGonigle, a civil engineer, and fireman Bryson,
from Newcastle, County Down, had won this title four times between them
before, though never together. They are likely to race for Scotland and
Eire respectively at the World Mountain Racing Cup in Edinburgh later
this year.
Eos finished in 37hr 38min 12sec, winning by just 74 seconds. Last
year's monohull class-winning skipper, Ross Hobson, from Kirkley, was
third in Fingers Crossed, a Formula 40 catamaran, in 38-20-21.
First to cross the line, 10 minutes ahead of Eos, was Geronimo, the
Admiral's Cup yacht from Regatta Racing Services in Largs, which had
been chartered to Lomond School, and was crewed by nine pupils with
eight adults. Geronimo's athletes are not allowed to run the full adult
distance, and so were ineligible for overall victory. Subsequently,
following a protest, they were penalised 75 minutes for brief but
illegal engine-use during a pick-up of runners from their dinghy.
However, the young crew proved this to be a very fast boat -- and it
will be worked up for the Admiral's Cup during West Highland week, which
begins on Thursday, with Olympic gold medal sailor Rodney Pattisson
flogging his team into shape.
Conditions on board were spartan in the extreme. To save weight there
is not even a coat of paint. Like a half-finished church hall with
scaffolding in place, the inside looked like a United Nations food dump
-- copious rations for the kids supplied by fond parents.
The wee souls had only cold running water, and just one chemical
toilet, inevitably insufficent. Bucket-and-chuck-it, became the order of
the day. They say this moulds character.
If the six-tonne Geronimo enjoyed space-age technology, Eos, named
after the Greek goddess of the dawn, upon which I was an observer,
boasted two of Britain's most experienced yachtsmen. Fitzgerald, who
runs Oban Yacht Services, and Jeffes, a marine architect from Largs,
will skipper the Scottish entries in the Round Britain race this August.
Fitzgerald had twice helmed monohulls to success in the race, and his
icey calm, threading their 51ft Beneteau into Craighouse on Jura,
through the shallow, wreck-strewn entry in pitch black, under sail, had
owner Venzo grimacing nervously.
In less frantic moments, round-the-world veteran Jeffes revealed
bizarre but effective remedies from medical cronies with whom he has
sailed. One human doctor recommends superglue for sealing hacks on
rope-split fingers, while a vet swears by udder cream, applied by dairy
maids to cows, to stop hands from splitting.
But Jeffes' verdict on Two Hoots' crew, when warned they would be
committed rowers should the wind drop, was to come back and haunt him:
''Anyone who rows a boat deserves to be committed.''
Less than five minutes separated Eos, Geronimo, and Two Hoots on
leaving Lamlash on the home run. But once past Holy Island, they ran
into a calm. When Two Hoots took to the oars, Jeffes ate his words, and
with Venzo, a vast bear of a man, leapt to power their 20-tonner with
huge sweeps -- also a race-winning move. For almost two hours they
sweated, spelled by the exhausted runners. Nobody had more than three
hours sleep in two days.
Endurance runners claim to go faster on pasta, but Venzo, an
Italian-Rhodesian, proved boats can sail brisker on pizza. Mantua, where
his food manufacturing company is based, is the world's biggest
producer, which explains the full title of his boat. Though resident for
several years at Skelmorlie, this was his first attempt at the Whyte and
Mackay event.
The mainbrace was still being copiously spliced last night as the last
of the fleet limped home. Provisional results:
Overall: 1, Eos Mantua Surgelati (Adrian Venzo, Skelmorlie) 37hr 38min
12sec; 2, Two Hoots (John Offard, Taynuilt) 37-39-26; 3, Fingers Crossed
(Ross Hobson, Kirkley) 38-20-21. Youth team: Red Arrow (RAF Sailing
Association) 38-41-40. Fastest stages: Oban-Salen (18 miles): Geronimo,
3-21-40; Salen-Craighouse (53 miles): Fingers Crossed, 6-11-57;
Craighouse-Lamlash (69 miles): Geronimo, 11-3-40; Lamlash-Troon (17
miles): RAF Meridian 2-11-36. King of the Bens: 1, Dermot McGonigle and
Robbie Bryson (Ben More, 3-15-43; Paps of Jura, 4-46-33; Goat Fell,

Everton 1, Manchester United 0
EVERTON manager Joe Royle always believed that his team would win the
FA Cup. Apparently, he told his directors that on the day he was
appointed manager towards the end of last year.
At the time Everton were rooted to the foot of the Premiership table,
but Royle had a belief in his own ability, and a feeling for the club
which convinced him that a cup victory was a possibility.
Outside of Royle, few would have believed that this Goodison Park side
would have been able to beat the aristocrats of English football,
Manchester United, in the final. That they did so is a tribute to Royle
himself, and his exceptional abilities as a manager.
On the day, it was also down to the incredible goalkeeping of the
veteran, Neville Southall. Like his team, Southall had been all but
written off this season. Yet, in the second half, he recaptured all his
former magic.
There was a double save from Paul Scholes and a diving stop which
prevented Gary Pallister scoring with a header. As United manager Alex
Ferguson conceded later: ''Neville Southall rekindled all his great days
in just one afternoon.
''When he is in that kind of form you have to produce something
special to beat him, and we were never able to find that. He was quite
magnificent.''
Southall's second-half heroics defended the one-goal lead which
Everton had following a first-half goal from one-time Rangers frontman
Paul Rideout.
At that stage the Merseyside men deserved their lead. The Swede,
Anders Limpar, ran the show for them, spraying passes around, and
outshining the multi-million pound talents of Paul Ince and Roy Keane.
In fact, Everton might have scored again in that first half. They did
not do so and United found themselves still there in the second half
with a chance to salvage their season. They were not able to do so
because of Southall and a determined performance by Everton.
Sadly, they were left to face defeat for the second time in six days.
Last Sunday they lost the league title, now they had lost the FA Cup,
and a season which had promised so much ended in the ashes of despair.
Alex Ferguson had to live with that again while his namesake, Duncan,
cavorted around Wembley wearing a clown's nose -- a blue one of course
-- and celebrating his first major honour.
''It was just brilliant to be involved,'' he said. ''I had not played
in the first team for nearly two months and the manager decided that I
should be on the bench. To win the cup is amazing. When I first joined
the club on loan it looked as if we would be relegated.
''But Joe Royle arrived and changed everything. We all know just how
much he has meant to us.''
Ferguson came on to replace Rideout in the second half. He was the man
the Evertonians wanted to see in action. It was his name they chanted as
they marched up Wembley Way before the final. And it was his name again
on their lips as they celebrated afterwards.
Yesterday, Ferguson simply looked forward to saluting these fans who
have made him a cult hero on Merseyside. The tall striker, who has cost
more than #8m already in transfer fees, recognises that these fans have
supported him through his off-field troubles.
He realises, too, that Royle had faith in him. There is a debt there
that the troubled Ferguson will never forget. A debt that over the years
he will repay with more moments like those he enjoyed at Wembley.
For the other Ferguson there will be a close season of contemplation,
of thinking what might have been, and of readying United for another
assault on the Premiership, on the cups, and on Europe.
The Champions' League, however, will not be on the agenda. Instead,
United will play in the UEFA Cup. Blackburn Rovers will take centre
stage, Everton will edge behind them in the Cup-winners' Cup, but United
will not rest.
Ferguson, Alex that is, will be back. His United team, with changes,
will be favourites once more for the title.
As for Everton, Royle will continue to make progress. And part of that
progress will be the growing maturity of Duncan Ferguson, the striker
whose off-field troubles have often obscured the fact that he is a
prodigious talent.
A talent which could win more prizes for his club, and even help his
country towards the European Championship finals in England next summer.
EVERTON -- Southall, Jackson, Hinchcliffe, Watson, Ablett, Parkinson,
Horne, Stuart, Rideout, Limpar, Unsworth. Substitutes -- Ferguson,
Amokachi, Kearton.
MANCHESTER UNITED -- Schmeichel, Irwin, Bruce, Pallister, Neville,
Sharpe, Ince, Keane, Butt, McClair, Hughes. Substitutes -- Giggs,
Scholes, Walsh.
Referee -- G Ashby (Worcestershire).
* AS Everton's cup celebrations were in full swing, one of the heroes
was miles away, walking his dog on Llandudno beach.
Goalkeeper Neville Southall left his team-mates to their victory
banquet, dashing straight home to be with his family and antique clock
collection in Wales.
But he left behind a manager eternally grateful that he ignored his
first instinct to dump the Welsh legend, and nothing would persuade the
36-year-old to hang around for the party.
''That's Neville for you -- nicely awkward,'' said manager Joe Royle.
''He's not shy, but he is unassuming. We asked him to stay and he said
'Why?' He's his own man, and I just let him get on with it. As long as
he continues to play like that, I'm not bothered.
''I came to the club with an open mind, but I'd seen one or two goals
on the telly and people were pointing the finger. We had a couple of
days that were, let's say, interesting between us. But from the first
game he's been magnificent.''

Camelon 2, Whitburn 0
THE OVD Scottish Junior Cup has found a new home. So often shuffled
around Ayrshire as if in an exclusive game of pass the parcel, the
trophy was fought out on this occasion between two teams from the East
Region for only the fourth time, and deservedly ended up at Camelon.
They were the hungrier side, with the three-pronged threat of Davy
Flynn, Chris McKenzie, and Allan McGonigal proving too much for the
over-run Whitburn defence at Fir Park, Motherwell.
McKenzie's goal 19 minutes from time clinched victory after defender
Graeme Wood had been presented with a gift opener 19 minutes into the
match.
The tricky McKenzie always looked capable of finding the net while
former Stirling Albion man Flynn switched from scorer-in-chief to
goal-maker.
He received a special award as the top scorer in the competition this
season with 11 goals but he confessed later, somewhat modestly: ''I
didn't have my best game but the boys around me all did well.''
''This is the biggest day in any Junior player's career,'' added
Flynn. ''When it comes to a moment like this, you've got your home town
out, you've won the cup -- and you can't describe it.''
It seemed to be an omen when Whitburn appeared in the claret and amber
shirts so popular among the Fir Park regulars. Even the gold-coloured
scarves of their support seemed to have that lucky hue associated with
such as Largs Thistle, the holders, and those multiple winners
Auchinleck Talbot.
But Camelon had no problem with that, no feeling of destiny other than
that there was going to be a new name on the cup and it might as well be
theirs.
They fielded their usual formation of three up front and three in the
middle, hoping that they would be enough threat to overcome Whitburn's
sweeper system.
Camelon soon indicated a willingness to use the wings, with a McKenzie
pass releasing Flynn on the left in only the second minute and although
his 30-yard effort from outside the junction of the box seemed a bit a
hopeful, it demonstrated his determination to shoot on sight. The
Falkirk side's front three continued to link up well especially on what
seemed to be their favoured left side.
Whitburn's David Scott got in a low shot which failed to trouble
keeper Alan Banner but the Lothians team gave away a couple of free
kicks which allowed Camelon to resume their threats.
Paul Taylor promised to be Whitburn's danger man at set pieces but
from his free-kick wide on the right after 18 minutes there was no-one
to follow up when keeper Banner parried the cross.
A minute later Whitburn found themselves a goal down after a
goalkeeping error. McKenzie's tenacity won a corner on the left which
Kemp sent into the hands of keeper Robert Burns. The keeper, too eager
to set up an attack through left back Colin Grant, made a mess of his
throw, which rebounded off Camelon defender, Wood, who had been up for
the corner. He steadied himself and turned to lob the ball over the
keeper from 15 yards.
But Whitburn soon recovered from the shock of losing a goal in such a
manner to set up a couple of moves on their own. David Scott should have
done better with a header which he put wide in Whitburn's best chance so
far and then Taylor laid the ball off to Mike McAvoy, who miskicked past
a post.
Whitburn were beginning to find some gaps but the half ended with
Camelon almost adding to their lead when a McKenzie cross just eluded
McGonigal six yards out.
Both defences were rather shaky at the start of the second half and
McGonigal shot just past a post after having turned his marker. Flynn
then had to clear at the back post of his own goal as Whitburn turned on
some pressure, before McKenzie took a pass from George Fairley and
chipped over the advancing keeper but only on to the roof of the net.
Efforts by McKenzie, Scott and McGonigal, twice, came close but the
second goal arrived in 71 minutes. Flynn beat two defenders to the ball
and headed on for McKenzie to gather it, get the ball under control, and
flick it past the advancing Burns from 10 yards.
However, Whitburn were not finished yet. John Willkinson headed just
wide from a Taylor corner and a Clouston 35-yard lob had Banner
back-pedalling although in no real danger of being caught out.
As time ran out, Whitburn came more and more desperate, resorting to
high crosses as Camelon were content to fall back. Everyone knew by now
where the cup was going but the Whitburn fans stayed on till the end.
CAMELON -- Banner, G Smith, Haston, Fairley, Wood, Scott, McKenzie,
Ellis, McGonigal, Flynn, Kemp. Substitutes -- D Smith, Anderson,
McLaren, McArthur, Hendry.
WHITBURN -- Burns, Clouston, Grant, Belcher, Prior, Jardine,
Richardson, McAvoy, Scott, Wilkinson, Taylor. Substitutes -- McIlhone,
McManus, Croalla, Finlay, McPhee.
Referee -- K Toner (Glasgow).

THE compensation dispute between Kilmarnock and Celtic, which has been
dragging on for 10 months, should end sometime today when Lord Ranald
McLean, chairman of the arbitration panel charged with settling the row,
is expected to deliver a verdict.
It is thought he will decide Celtic have a case to answer and that
Kilmarnock may be awarded substantial damages, although not as much as
the #350,000 they believe they are due.
Celtic have already been fined a record #100,000 by the Scottish
League for having breached the game's protocol by enticing Tommy Burns
and Billy Stark to leave Rugby Park and form a new management team at
Celtic Park.
Kilmarnock then sought compensation through the SFA, who referred the
matter to arbitration.
It is understood the panel will meet probably for the last time in a
Cumbernauld hotel and the verdict, which is to be legal and binding on
both parties, is bound to upset one of the clubs.
However, the rest of football will be glad to have an end to the
dispute which has done the game's image little good and which has
provided further evidence of football's inability to sort out its
affairs quietly and with a sense of decorum.
If the judgment goes against Celtic, their managing director, Fergus
McCann, is likely to feel even more that he and his club have been
persecuted by the authorities.
McCann has maintained his conduct was not improper from the beginning
of the matter, but he could be made to pay a second heavy price if again
he has failed to convince others of his innocence.

Christopher Portway breaks for the border
WITH England, and Britain in general, growing in popularity as a
holiday and short break destination, there is a growing need for some to
locate and explore parts of their own land not overrun by others of the
same mind. Such places are becoming rarer but many still exist.
Carlisle and the North Pennines for instance. The honeypots of
England's north are of course the nearby Lake District and, to a lesser
extent, the seaside of Morecambe and the more visible portions of
Hadrian's Wall. Few southerners and not all northerners realise how
delightful a city Carlisle has become, nor appreciate the haunting
beauty of the bare uplands of the North Pennines hiding a historical
past ranging from pre-Roman to less than a century gone by.
The city of Carlisle ranks with Berwick-upon-Tweed as a long-standing
English/Scottish battlefield. Its unofficial title of ''The Key of
England'' metaphorically unlocking the history and culture of the
Northumbrian frontier.
Through effective replanning and refurbishment the centre has been
transformed from untidy, traffic-snarled urbanity to a well laid-out
sequence of squares, streets and lanes devoid of vehicles and providing
easy access to the city's fine shops and attractions.
The heritage industry is easily sniped at and much derided but I could
find not a word of criticism against what the planners of a re-styled
Carlisle have done to their city, while still managing to retain much
that is reminiscent of the days when kings and military leaders passed
through its streets or sojourned within its walls as their armies took
part in the backwards and forwards surges of warfare.
With the whole of the town's handsome centre pedestrianised including
the main square surrounding the Old Town Hall from which narrow,
oft-covered lanes provide intriguing short-cuts to adjacent localities,
Carlisle's chief components are easily located. It remained a walled
city for 700 years having but three entrances -- English Gate, Scottish
Gate and Irish Gate -- but only fragments remain though the more recent
citadel provides a suitably imposing entry today.
Tullie House, the city museum, is one of those rare breeds of museum
without a ''do not touch'' notice anywhere to be seen. Strong in local
Roman history and effective data on Hadrian's Wall it is a modern, airy
place alive with working models and audio-visual presentations.
The red sandstone cathedral, though reduced from its original size as
the result of civil war between king and parliament in the seventeenth
century, has a dignity in keeping with a seat established as long ago as
1133. Likewise the castle, standing on the mound bounded by two rivers,
holds sufficient majesty to summon an impression of its worth as a
northerly bastion of England.
Lonely border forts, some isolated and not all that easy to find, make
alternate viewing to the much-frequented Hadrian's Wall along the
Scottish border. But more exciting to the discerning visitor requiring
comparative solitude are the North Pennine uplands lying South-east of
the city.
Here is a vast landscape of remote hills, clear streams, impressive
waterfalls, outcrops of barren rock and secluded valleys, a territory of
legends, of battles long ago, the cattle rustling ''reivers'' and the
mouldering but evocative remains of an industry of yesteryear.
Through this so-called ''last wilderness in England'' runs the Eden
river in a green and pleasant valley steeped in historical associations.
The river rises high in the Pennines to slice an idyllic route
northwards through the hills to Carlisle and the Solway Firth. ''A name
fetched from paradise and rightfully borne'' wrote Wordsworth who never
bestowed his compliments lightly.
It was from Kirkby that I departed this land of far horizons. I
travelled South-eastwards on the fortuitously-saved Carlisle to Settle
railway line which allowed me one last glimpse of those ethereal hills
among which are hidden so many secrets.

FROM a narrow seam of land between East and West Loch Tarbert is sewn
Kintyre. Almost severed from its mother mainland, almost an island, its
40 miles length by eight miles width holds within its boundaries distant
memories of a turbulent time while today being the owner of a healthy
appetite for life.
Kintyre takes its name from the Gaelic Ceann Tire which means the head
of the land. And in those early days it was largely populated by
immigrants from Northern Ireland.
The visitor today from Glasgow and central Scotland is less likely to
arrive by boat but to travel by road past Loch Lomond, through Tarbet
and Inveraray and down the A83 to Tarbert. It is in this town that
Kintyre begins.
Tarbert provides the perfect gateway for the lands to its south. The
bustling little town has been over the years made busy by its fishing
boats, however, their numbers are now much reduced and they have given
way to the colourful sail of the yacht. Indeed, when the West Highland
yacht race takes place in August, Tarbert will be much to the forefront.
Six miles south of Tarbert the east and west coast roads are joined by
the B8001. Apart from this the only other road that joins the coastal
routes is to the south, at Campbeltown. No other roads cross this,
Scotland's longest peninsula, because of its rocky spine.
In this loop of road, bypassed by Scotland's main tourist routes, is
an area of immense scenic grandeur. Allowed to be at peace with itself,
its beauty has remained unspoilt and its people have grown up far
removed from the pollutants that follow overcrowding. A drive along the
west and east coast roads reveal the exciting variety of scenery.
The rugged coastline of the west looks out to the Atlantic Ocean which
returns tirelessly a battery of surf waves on to its sandy beaches. The
east coast road by contrast gently slips over heather-clad hills,
through lush glens and forests on a coast with sandy beaches and rocky
outcrops looking out to Kilbrannan Sound.
There is without doubt an abundance of peace and calm in Kintyre but
the visitor is not without attractions to visit. And for the sports
inclined sailing, fishing, golf and tennis are all to be found on either
side of the peninsula.
On the east coast road at Claonaig the car ferry to Lochranza in Arran
has a regular seasonal appointment. Nearby, is Skipness Castle, an early
fourteenth-century curtain-wall castle which guards the northern
approaches to the Kilbrannan Sound. It is a worthwhile diversion a
little along the way of a dead-end road.
Kintyre awaits your approval and as the east coast road continues by
Crossaig and Grogport there are good views on to Arran and its ragged
peaks. Farther on is the picturesque village of Carradale, and like
Tarbert much of the town's industry comes from the sea. Forest, hill and
glen trails and sea fishing, canoeing and squash offer recreational
pursuits but the area is home to an abundance of wildlife and golden
eagles, seals, deer and the otter all seek your attention.
The road winds its way south and the abbey at Saddell, or what is left
of its ruins, is considered by many to be the most important historical
site in Kintyre. It is reputed to be the burial place of Somerled, Lord
of the Isles and forefather of Clans Donald and MacDougall.
All along the way hotels, guest houses, self-catering cottages and
caravan sites offer the visitor plenty of variety from which to choose
accommodation.
At the entrance to Campbeltown Loch is Davaar Island, linked to the
mainland by a bank of shingle which can be crossed at low water. In 1887
a great mystery shrouded the island. The sudden appearance of a cave
painting depicting the Crucifixion scene baffled locals and it was not
until some years later that it was found to be the work of local artist,
Alexander Mackinnon.
Campbeltown is the engine room of Kintyre and its harbour and fishing
boats remain key factors in the town's economy. Whisky too, played a
major role and at one time there were 34 distilleries, today two is
company and Springbank is the more famous having been in continuance
operation since 1823. Campbeltown Cross, at the pier head, is a lavishly
carved Celtic Cross which was sculpted more than 600 years ago. Custom
has it that all funerals which take place in town make a detour past the
cross.
A few miles from Campbeltown, but on the other side of the peninsula
is Machrihanish, world-famous for its championship golf links. Designed
by Old Tom Morris in 1876, the course is memorable with its opening
hole. A day ticket costs #28 and there is a weekly option available at a
cost of #112.
Southend is a few miles south of Campbeltown and once there Ireland is
a 12-mile step. The area is full of history and it is here where St
Columba landed on his way to Iona in 561. More than a thousand years
later General Leslie was the cause of 300 being slaughtered when
Dunaverty Castle surrendered to him and his band of Covenanters. From
Southend it is an eight-mile journey along a single-track road to the
Mull of Kintyre where from its magnificent cliffs the peace is only
shattered by the waves crashing on to the rocks far below.
The west coast road from Campbeltown passes through an area of lush
rich farmland known as The Laggan to Westport which is at the head of
the five-mile long Machrihanish beach.
At Tayinloan, a few miles north, is the terminal for the ferry to
Gigha, an even quieter unspoilt island which translates from Gaelic as
God's Isle. Sir James Horlick bought the island in 1944 and it is there
that he pursued his passion for growing rhododendrons and exotic shrubs.
The gardens of Achamore extend to almost 50 acres and banks of flowers
provide a stunning spectacle of colour between March and June and have
become a place of pilgrimage for gardening experts all around the world.
Bicycles may be hired for exploration that has limits on time but at
no point will you be more than three miles from the ferry. But to
Tayinloan and the A83 to head northwards.
Look out for seals basking on the rock near Clachan, a special lay-by
has been built so that you may watch them at near quarters. The main
road rises sharply as it makes its way towards West Loch and Tarbert
providing a final glimpse of the magnificent scenery that is what
Scottish calendars are made of.

Pretoria
SCOTLAND team manager Duncan Paterson has heavily criticised the
decision by the Rugby World Cup organisers to interrupt team preparation
on Saturday by insisting that the 16 nations gather at Cape Town for an
opening lunch.
For the Scots, and the other countries in their pool -- Ivory Coast,
Tonga, and France -- the lunch-date entailed a 2000km round trip lasting
more than 13 hours.
In order to catch the flight back to their Pretoria base, the Scots,
like many other nations, had to leave the lunch early. It was marred,
also, by torrential rain which flooded the marquee setting.
Yesterday, as the Scottish side underwent a gruelling contact training
session, Paterson said: ''The trip certainly was not in the best
interests of the players. It isn't the first time that this has
happened. The same thing occurred in both 1987 and 1991.
''It is done for the best of reasons, but at this time in our
preparations, it isn't good.''
The Scottish Rugby Union made representations to the RWC organisers in
1987 and 1991, but to no avail. They were told that attendance at the
opening lunch was part of their contractual obligations.
''The policy is ridiculous. Some teams had to travel further than
others, and so it is not even a level playing field for all of the
competing countries.
''In a way, I feel sorry for those who organised the lunch. There were
700 people there in a marvellously rigged out marquee. It was a
tremendous effort but, as I've said, it's not in the best interests of
the players.''
The Scots trained again twice yesterday at the Harlequins ground in
Pretoria. As dusk was falling, the forwards underwent a gruelling
scrummaging session.
The Scottish pack drew applause from a sizeable crowd of onlookers as
they sustained 3500lb of pressure on the Rhino Grand Slam scrummaging
machine with which each nation has been supplied.
Scotland hooker Kenny Milne joked: ''That's some pressure. That's why
I'll end up in a wheelchair with a tartan rug wrapped around my legs.''
The injured Kenny Logan (hamstring) and Bath prop David Hilton (ankle)
took no part in yesterday's session. The two went to a local pool and
gymnasium while the rest of the squad trained. Paterson said that, so
far as selection is concerned, the management were still studying the
options open to them but it was hoped that everyone, including Hilton,
would be available for selection when the side to meet Ivory Coast on
Friday is chosen tonight.
Stand-off Craig Chalmers was another who did not train yesterday. He
is confined to bed with a throat infection but he, too, is expected to
be available for selection.
Today, the Scots will make the two-hour trip to the leisure resort of
Sun City, north of Pretoria, and tomorrow and Wednesday they will
conduct private training sessions away from the eyes of the media, and
watchers from opposing camps.

ONE of Scottish football's carnival occasions, the OVD Scottish Junior
Cup Final, brought a first success yesterday for Camelon, who beat
Whitburn 2-0 at colourful Fir Park, Motherwell.
Goals in each half for Graeme Wood and Chris McKenzie made it a golden
day for the Mariners, Camelon's nickname since the days when that
district of Falkirk was a shipping centre on the Forth and Clyde Canal.
But there could be a silver lining for the gold-clad Whitburn fans as
the ''Burnie'' could still beat the team in red in the race for the East
League title.
Camelon's success comes a few months short of their seventy-fifth
anniversary and is a particular triumph for the Fairley family.
Team captain George, 37, is co-manager with his brother, Brian, and
both of them previously gave long service to Whitburn. Brian managed the
West Lothian club before lifting Camelon from the doldrums four years
ago to the East League title last season while George won a number of
trophies in his 14 years with Whitburn. Brian also played in the cup
winning Bo'ness team of 1984.
Among Camelon's guests yesterday was John Hansen, father of former
Scottish internationalists Alan and John. John senior played in the
Camelon team who lost by the only goal to Kilbirnie Ladeside in the 1952
final.
This success also gives the Falkirk area something to celebrate on the
football front after three near misses this season by the senior clubs.
Falkirk finished a few points short of a place in the UEFA Cup while
Stenhousemuir and East Stirlingshire both missed out after having looked
set for promotion in the lower divisions.

Aberdeen 3, Dunfermline 1
ABERDEEN'S durable fans should be able to leave the worry beads at
home for the last fling of the season, the return leg of this play-off
for a place in the premier division at East End Park on Thursday.
It may not be quite over yet but, after all they have been through,
the Dons must be odds-on to defend, and maybe improve upon, a two-goal
cushion.
The team that has been fighting for the past few months with admirable
tenacity, a quality not lacking in their new manager, Roy Aitken, had to
dig deep into reserves for the overtime stage of the season against a
team that let no-one down.
Aberdeen now know first hand that Dunfermline are a very competent
side with no shortage of self-belief. For that reason they will need to
make certain they maintain their application, but with Billy Dodds due
back after suspension, they ought to secure their premier division
status at last.
The Dons found the Fife defence determined and well-organised and it
was not until Duncan Shearer hit the second of his two goals a couple of
minutes from the end that they were able to heave a sigh of relief.
Dunfermline defended well and when they moved forward they found signs
of vulnerability in the Aberdeen back-line. It was Stephen Glass, who
will be 19 tomorrow and the best player in the Aberdeen side on the day,
who was involved in the first two goals, scoring the first and helping
to set up the second for Shearer.
Between those, former Aberdeen player Craig Robertson stunned the
Pittodrie faithful with an equaliser which threatened to spoil the game
plan.
It was the Fifers who created the first two real chances of the
afternoon. Brian Grant lost possession to Mark McCulloch, the ball was
moved on to Stewart Petrie and his shot from about 16 yards was only a
couple of feet wide.
Allan Moore had a clear opening, too, when Andy Tod's header reached
him just inside the area, but he hit his shot much too high.
Aberdeen came close to taking the lead midway through the first half
when Thomson beat Derek Fleming cleverly and shot firmly, only to see
Guido van de Kamp save right under the bar. Then, when a cross from the
left found Shearer, the striker's header was well placed but still did
not beat the diving van de Kamp.
The keeper made another fine save following a Stephen Wright throw-in,
taken up by Grant and then fed to Thomson. His effort was stopped at the
near post.
Tod had his name taken for a foul on Peter Hetherston, followed a few
minutes later, by both Brian Irvine and Moore who got involved in a
scuffle.
Aberdeen finally found a way to goal, six minutes before the break
after Paul Smith gave away a free kick about 25 yards out. Glass stepped
up to send in a left-footed free kick which bounced awkwardly just in
front of the keeper and went over the line.
The locals were still singing when Dunfermline very nearly equalised
with a fine Petrie shot which was magnificently saved by Snelders.
Aberdeen took charge again after the interval, but just as their fans
were counting down to the next goal, they were startled to see it arrive
at the other end.
A short corner on the left from Smith to Moore caught the home defence
on the wrong foot and when the winger's cross came all the way to the
far post, Robertson was there to head down and past Snelders.
The Fife players did a dance of delight in front of their delirious
fans and were given such a lift that within a minute they had forced two
more corners.
However, Aberdeen were able to respond in some style themselves with a
second goal seven minutes later. Glass took a viciously swinging corner
from the right which van de Kamp could only parry and when McKimmie
lobbed it back into goal there was Shearer to head into the net.
McKimmie was not so clever shortly afterwards when he had his name
taken for a foul on Petrie, but might have suffered greater indignity
when he held back Moore inside the penalty area. The Fifers were furious
as referee Les Mottram ignored their penalty claims.
The best piece of play of the day came from young Glass when he left a
trail of defenders in his wake with a mazy run through the heart of the
Fife defence, but finished off with a shot over the bar. He deserved a
better punch line.
Dunfermline substituted Greg Shaw for Moore as they tried to hold the
line for the remaining minutes, and they very nearly made it, too. But
with two minutes left, Aberdeen snatched the goal that could make all
the difference in the return on Thursday.
Irvine sent the ball to Shearer in the inside left position and,
although there was a half-hearted claim for offside from the Fifers,
Shearer's left foot shot into the corner of the net stood.
Afterwards, Dunfermline manager Bert Paton refused to accept that his
team's promotion hopes were just about over for another year. But he was
angry at two decisions which went against his team and his comments will
guarantee an invitation from the SFA to explain himself.
''I was sure we should have had a penalty in the second half when
Moore was pulled down by McKimmie,'' he said. ''How you could interpret
that as 'play on' I don't know.
''I was also disappointed with the third goal which looked offside.
I'll be interested to see it on television.''
Paton still believes a turnaround is possible. ''We have a great
chance, I have no shadow of doubt about that. They'll get one helluva
game at East End Park and we'll be going out with all guns blazing.''
ABERDEEN -- Snelders, McKimmie, Wright, Grant, Irvine, Smith,
Hetherston, Shearer, Miller, Thomson, Glass. Substitutes -- Inglis,
Watt, McKinnon.
DUNFERMLINE -- Van de Kamp, McNamara, Fleming, McCathie, Tod, Smith,
Den Bieman, Robertson, Moore, Petrie, McCulloch. Substitutes -- Shaw,
Westwater, Hawkins.

WHEN councillors from Dumfries District Council arrive at Carlisle
Cemetery, Ken West will show them first the cardboard coffins painted in
oak-leaf design and the colours of Carlisle United.
From the ivy-streaked little chapel where they rest, it is only a
short walk for the Scottish delegation to the world's first woodland
burial ground.
A woodland burial is a return to nature in an environmental era.
Bodies are buried not in a cemetery, but an area of land which will
become woodlands. There are no headstones and instead an oak sapling
will be planted four to six weeks after the body is buried. The deceased
is often buried in a woollen shroud or a bio-degradable cardboard
coffin.
It was the idea of Mr West, the town's bereavement services manager,
to offer a more environmental option. In 1990, he prepared a document
which was then approved by Carlisle District Council. Money become
available in 1992, and the first woodland burial took place in 1993.
There have been 15 burials to date and a further 47 plots have been
purchased.
Across England, there are five nature reserve burial grounds
controlled by local authorities, 20 run privately by farmers, and 30
more are in various stages of planning, including three in Scotland. The
estates department in Edinburgh is looking for a suitable site after the
idea was approved late last year.
In Aberdeen, the environmental health department is examining ways to
fit such an area into the plans for their new cemetery at Hazlehead,
while Glasgow District Council could receive a proposal for such a site
from the cemeteries and cremations office within the next 12 months.
Last week, the director of environmental services at Dumfries District
Council said of the visit: ''It's early days, and we have just decided
to look at the idea.'' So on Friday June 2, a sub-committee from
environmental services department, led by John Helmsley, will walk to
the woodland site.
It's a pleasant walk through the Victorian section, where the oldest
of the cemetery's 70,000 graves lie. Clipped yews rise on the right and
a family of herons nests in one of the taller trees.
The cemetery, which opened in 1855, is bisected by a small stream
called ''fairy beck'' and contains a number of wildlife initiatives,
including bird and bat boxes and butterfly beds. The woodland burial
area lies on the cemetery perimeter. A brick wall lies on one side, with
the burial area stretching into open fields.
As only a small percentage of the available land is currently used,
the extra land is fenced off and used for grazing. So under the shade of
the giant ash trees and hedgerows, the Dumfries councillors will look
out over the little oak saplings and grazing sheep, across the Pennines,
while standing on the spot where Inglewood forest once stood.
Mr West will tell them of past burials, of the horticulturalist who
grew the tree he lies under, of the farm sales supplier who had a large
hatchback car as a hearse and farm-labourers as pall-bearers. And Mrs
Janette McCallum Wagner, who brought her husband's body down from East
Lothian to grant him his dying wish.
Mrs Wagner's husband, Peter, died of cancer on November 26, 1994.
During his long illness, they freely discussed his demise. ''I asked him
what he wanted me to do with his remains. Then he said that he wanted a
bio-degradable coffin, a woodland burial and a tree planted on top. I
said, 'That'll teach me for asking'.''
She found out about Carlisle Cemetery after contacting Friends Of The
Earth and a helpful local councillor, who gave her Mr West's phone
number. A service of remembrance was held in their home town of East
Linton before the burial in Carlisle. Most friends and family, including
Mr Wagner's elderly parents, eventually came round to the idea.
''Only one person said to me that they thought it was a DIY job with
no dignity. To them, I simply said thanks for attending. For me, it was
quite lovely and it felt good, it took away a lot of the pain because it
wasn't rushed and I was always involved.'' Before the cardboard coffin
was closed, she placed inside some rosemary, a tartan ribbon and a lock
of her hair.
It would seem that death is being dragged back from the funeral
directors. As more people nurse a partner through a long illness, a
small but increasing number are becoming reluctant to relinquish the
body to the hands of strangers such as undertakers, prefering to make
the final arrangements, where possible, themselves.
In London, the Natural Death Centre has opened, offering information
about alternative funerals and supplying cheap, green DIY coffins. A
book has also been published entitled Undertaken With Love: A Guide to
DIY Funerals. It is written by Jane Spottiswood, whose husband wanted to
be left on a compost heap, but English law wouldn't allow it.
When playwright and screenwriter Robert Bolt died this year, he
insisted on being buried in his own back garden. His original request
for a cardboard coffin was made impossible by his 20-stone bulk.
Chipboard was used instead. Also, when the mother of actor Ralph Fiennes
died in 1993, her family decided to make their own preparations.
The coffin was painted in her favourite colour, the whole family laid
her out, drove the coffin to the graveyard and buried her themselves.
Her husband was quoted as saying: ''I did not want black suits and black
cars with their professional piety.''
Ken West explained that the idea for a woodland burial area was
triggered by an increase in the number of people asking advice about
burial in their garden. As this can decrease the value of the home by up
to 50% -- if a sale is at all possible -- and post-sale the relative
loses all rights, he advised against it, but asked why it was wanted.
''They all said that they wanted to be buried under a tree, so I
suggested that, if this was possible away from their home, would they be
interested, and they all agreed that yes, they would,'' he says. So Mr
West, who has worked in the business for 34 years, gave them what they
wanted.
Last year, during his term as president of the Institute of Burial and
Cremation Administrators, he began to prepare a charter for the
bereaved. The 80-page document will be adopted at the annual conference
in Swansea later this year, and involved the consultation of Scottish
members.
Its intent is to ensure that bereaved families get the type of service
and grave they want. In England, one man had his parents disinterred
after the minister refused to allow the words ''Mum and Dad'' on the
gravestone. The charter recommends that the bereaved are entitled, if
they wish, to a secular funeral.
The document will also recommend that cremation services should not
last 20 minutes, as in some areas, but 30 minutes and where possible 40
minutes. This is to get away from what Mr West called ''the factory line
image.'' It will also ask that funeral directors offer people a
''green'' choice, and will eventually phase out the use of teaks and
mahogany.
This week, the Office of Fair Trading claimed new legislation was
required to protect the public from unscrupulous undertakers after
investigations into the expanding market for pre-paid funeral plans. It
was discovered that firms were being liquidated with insufficient
finance to fund paid-for funerals. But to Mr West, the problems runs
deeper.
''Some funeral directors are simply exploiting people who are already
under a great deal of stress. I've known people to be charged #2500 for
a baby's funeral. They play on the idea of dignity and providing a good
send-off, when it can be done so much cheaper,''he says.
Mrs Wagner says: ''I think we have desensitised death by handing our
loved ones over to strangers. It wasn't always like that. It was the
Victorians trying to out do each other with pomp and show. What we have
turned funerals into is just so much packaging.''
Mr West decided to offer cardboard coffins after discovering that one
grieving widow was charged #300 by one funeral firm. The cheapest cost
of a woodland burial in Carlisle is now #395. A cardboard coffin can be
bought for #55, the purchase of the grave -- which can hold two burials
-- is #176, while the internment fee is #164, rising to #178 for a
non-resident of Carlisle.
A cardboard coffin bought from a Co-op funeral parlour would, however,
cost around #200, the same price as a chipboard coffin with a wood
veneer. The company says the price is designed to include the chain's
running costs. The chain's general manger, Sandy Alexander, says
woodland burials would be welcome in Scotland.
''The Co-op funeral parlours are always looking at ways of
personalising funerals, and I think that this will become a bigger issue
over the next two, three or four years. If people request woodland
burials, it will not cause a problem for us. In many ways, it will be
just as simple as a normal burial or cremation,'' he says.
The Office of Fair Trading found that the average cost of a funeral
rose from #790 to #1040 between 1989 and 1992. Although the cost of
cremation is generally cheaper across Britain, the price very much
depends on the location of the cremation. One reason for the rise in
funeral costs over the past few years is that crematoriums must -- under
the Environmental Act -- now monitor emissions of gas.
In Carlisle, a local artist, Heather Harker, will paint cardboard
coffins to any personal design for #200. To illustrate the potential,
she painted one coffin in Carlisle United colours, to the displeasure of
the team's manager. Despite the possible low price, cost is often of
little concern to those who wish a woodland burial.
Ironically, Scots law, unlike English law, places no restriction on
the method of disposing of the dead. It is not considered illegal to
create a private cemetery, although it could banned if it was a health
nuisance. Even burial at sea is permissable once a licence has been
obtained.
But to examine whether woodland burials will be chosen more often, it
may be possible to draw a parallel with cremation. In 1880, when an
English doctor cremated his dead child he was prosecuted and found
guilty, not of the act, but of offending public decency. The first legal
cremation took place in Woking just four years later in 1884. Only two
took place the following year. A century later, more than 400,000
cremations take place in Britain every year.

Sylvia Kingsley samples a city with appeal.
SEVILLE, exotic capital of And conjures up romantic images and sights.
Celebrated as the City of Expo in 1992 and as the setting for many
operas, it's associated with many legendary figures: Don Juan, Figaro
and Carmen.
The factory, now Seville's University, is one of the town's fine
pieces of architecture, and a stroll around shows there are still many
Carmen look-a-likes.
The poet, Lord Byron, said: ''It is a pleasant city famous for oranges
and women.'' And, the orange trees seem to be forever in bloom, along
with jasmine and the women.
Full of Moorish architecture, with geranium-filled, fountain-splashing
patios, Seville bursts with charm and people who love life. Cafes and
restaurants stay open most of the night, and people seem to catch up on
sleep during siesta time.
To wander among fine old mansions with wrought-iron balconies,
gracious squares, stunning gardens and grand monuments is a joy in the
Spanish sun, with the best of the monuments clustered together in the
centre. Awe-inspiring, the vast fifteenth-century Gothic cathedral,
built on the site of a former Mosque, is the third largest in the world
after St Paul's and St Peter's in Rome. Christopher Columbus lies buried
there.
Horse-drawn carriages stand ready to take you round town or through
the huge Maria Luisa Park which goes on for miles with landscaped
gardens, fountains and pools; a setting for the fine buildings for the
1929 Ibero-American exhibition.
The Royal Palace, the Alcazar, where Columbus reported to Queen
Isabella on the success of their new world enterprises, is open to the
public. Hung with priceless tapestries, it was enlarged for Pedro the
Cruel's harem of 800 women and echoes the Alhambra in Granada with
arches, patios and superb gardens where you can rest weary feet.
Narrow, winding lanes lead from the Alcazar to the Barrio Santa Cruz,
the ancient Jewish quarter, a maze of gleaming white houses among leafy
squares. Here day and night guitarists serenade tourists while they sip
their sherry and enjoy Tapas, the bite-size snacks of delicious spicy
food.
Now a restored warren of charming hotels and restaurants, Santa Cruz
is atmospheric with history and beauty like the Hostel del Laurel, once
the assignation of famous Spanish artists and writers, now a cosy hotel.
Seville has something for everyone, from jazz to classical concerts
nearly all year, culminating in the April Feria, said to be the biggest
fair in the world when parties go on for a week and you need stamina to
cope with the crowds as well as fun.
Seville and Cordoba go together as historic cities. To visit one
without the other is a loss. Take a tour or fast train to Cordoba, the
city which became the capital during Roman and Moorish times. The fast
train takes 30 minutes.
Much quieter than Seville, Cordoba's extensive Moorish and Jewish
quarters are a bigger network of atmospheric lanes with ancient
buildings and a synagogue which has survived since the fifteenth
century, now open for viewing.
All within walking distance are Arab waterwheels, a triumphal arch and
a Roman bridge with magnificent views at sunset. Cordoba's Art Museum,
full of curious artefacts as well as paintings, is set around a lovely
patio with trees which grow both oranges and lemons at the same time.
If you take a car to Cordoba, you are within easy each of lovely
countryside and mountains. Cordoba also offers its own regional cooking
-- a further good reason for going.

THE spraying is all up to date at last. The Ursus was no sooner
connected to the diesel tank so I wouldn't have to keep filling it as it
kept my Twerp-all from going solid, than it cleared up. I had a weather
window of five hours and got the job done.
I no longer dread Mossie's phone calls. He has stopped asking: ''And
fou much did they pay ye for going to Ayr Show, and fou much did you
lose by nae sprayin' that barley?'' He has really turned quite mellow
since the pounding he gave his body at the Pig Event at Birmingham.
In fact, despite himself, he has to admit that my barley is looking
well. I got four tonnes last year of one of the home fields and the best
of this year's looks better still, though being a yaval crop there is
little hope of a new record. You need a change from oil-seeds or
setaside to get that.
''It's nae for me to say,'' says my honorary consultant, ''but your
crops are looking second to mine.''
Now, you might think that, as Mossie is advising me, my crops would be
every bit as good as his. But the trouble is he deliberately leaves one
important ingredient out of my mixes to keep me in my place.
I was reminded of that this week by what has happened to the rape.
Everybody else's is coming out in flower but Mossie's isn't. This, he
tells me, is because he has applied a special chemical that inhibits the
flowering until, as the heat of summer builds up, the plants, like the
bursting of a dam, cascade into blooms that produce bigger and better
seeds.
When I reproached my consultant for not giving me the secret
ingredient he was ready with a reply as usual.
''You dinna need a chemical to hold back your flowers, you've got the
pigeons.''
He's right with half the fields. While three are bursting into bloom,
the three that the cushies found are a fortnight off flowering. Mossie
says the eaten crops will shock me. I hope so, for they do not look well
today.
Pennywashers, the white settler who made that first impact on the
village when he refused angrily to pay 15p for a penny washer, is
learning the hard way about life in the country.
He's into sheep now so he's discovered about the knackeries and how
expensive they can be when they start coming regularly.
He's adopted the principle that the old College advisers developed in
the 1950s and '60s. ''If a few sheep produced a small surplus then a few
more sheep would produce a bigger surplus.''
That did seem to work with dairy cows. Someone who was producing a lot
of good clean milk from a few cows but was finding it hard to cover
overheads was encouraged to take on another 10 cows. Quite often it did
seem to work.
But it was easy to run up against limits in that agricultural
philosophy. If a few more sheep produce a little more profit it does not
follow that 10 times the number of sheep will produce 10 times the
profit.
Now, when poor Pennywashers phones the knacker the girl says: ''Naa!
Nae again?'' It got so bad that Pennywashers started spreading his
business around until one day he was embarrassed by a queue of smelly
red lorries.
There is a natural number of sheep to the acre. A good farmer can bug
that trend by careful stocksmanship, but Pennywashers is finding out the
hard way.
I feel for the poor young man because I tried the same system when I
started farming. I soon had five times as many cattle here as my father
ever had and lost money like it was going out of fashion
Now I have fewer cattle than he ever had and they are making
year-on-year a small surplus. Soon I will have worked my way through the
accumulated losses of the early years and may have to start paying
income tax.
Despite the wealth of loss-making experience he can call on (at the
discussion group that assembles at the Salmon Inn on a Sunday to share
information and damn the weather and the Government). Pennywashers is
still buying the odd replacement.
He bought a ewe and Texel twins one Friday at Thainstone. A bargain
for sure he told me with eyes shining: ''Only #17 a head.''
But they weren't.
Sandy Fowlie, the man who used to buy stots for me when I needed them
for the grass, was at the ringside and afterwards Pennywashers thought
to pull his leg. ''What's the big farmer like you doing round the poor
man's ring? I thought you would only be seen at the cattle rings.''
''Oh well,'' said Sandy, ''I know what you mean but it was just an old
ewe of the wife's. She has a blind spot; she canna see fences. She's
been in every parish in Aberdeenshire and I'm must sick of her so I'm
just here to get rid of her.''
Pennywashers thought for a minute. ''She didn't have twin Texel lambs
at foot did she?''
Sure enough.
And that hasn't been his only problem. He bought a fine bargain pen of
13 ewes and 26 lambs and there wasn't a single set of twins. He had six
sets of triplets and seven singles. (Or so he told me but having counted
that out several times I see he can't add either.)
But Pennywashers is learning. He had them back at the mart last
Friday. He even made a small surplus on the deal, if you don't count
anything for his week spent chasing the ewe with the Texel twins round
Buchan.

FARMING journalists are usually quiet, shy, retiring people who hate
imposing their opinions on other people but even they can be prodded
into action sometime.
So it was when Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave announced his
intention to set up a rural review think-tank and also invite
submissions from all and sundry with a view to producing a White Paper,
the Guild of Agricultural Journalists -- an august body of some 600
souls committed to improving communications within the industry --
sought to put up their tuppence worth.
Needless to say, we were not alone. So far some 368 submissions have
been received by the Ministry of Agriculture from individuals and
organisations all offering their considered thoughts on the future of
that green and pleasant land that is England.
North of the Border things have been a bit slower and although almost
900 bodies have been asked to make their views known to the Scottish
Office by the end of May as fodder for a separate Scottish White Paper,
actual returns are still in penny numbers. Mind you, the Scottish Office
was a bit slower in getting off the mark in the first place and the
wheels of democracy and consultation in Scotland may grind slow but they
grind sure.
The real concern must be that with something approaching 1500 perhaps
widely varying inputs on either side of the Border the end result must
inevitably resemble the proverbial committee-style camel.
How much relative weight must the ministers give to submissions from
those who live and work in the countryside as opposed to those who
either just visit or use its facilities -- but who equally pay the taxes
to subsidise a large part of its activities? The wisdom of Solomon needs
to be invoked.
Even among those who live and work in rural areas the range of
activities are immensely diverse, ranging from those in the basic
industries of farming, forestry, fishing and tourism to those on the
periphery, such as transport, communications, crafts, construction and
that ephemeral and all-embracing sector known as the service industry.
The real priorities of the rural sector are little different to those
in the town -- jobs, reasonable housing, education, medical service and
transport or communication are perhaps top of the heap. The means by
which these can be achieved and, more importantly, retained are less
clear.
Most reasonable people and organisations would agree with the
sentiments expressed last week by four key rural organisations that:
''The countryside must not be seen as a museum but as a constantly
changing working environment capable of generating the jobs needed to
sustain rural countryside.''
This came in a report from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors,
the Royal Town Planning Institute, the County Planning Officers' Society
and the District Planning Officers' Society. It would certainly be
echoed throughout the United Kingdom.
More radically the report, Tomorrow's Countryside: A Rural Strategy,
went on to suggest the creation of a Cabinet Committee for Rural Affairs
to co-ordinate rural policy at national level. There are also those who
say there should be a complete Ministry for Rural Affairs, combining
certain activities of the Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Trade
and Industry and the Department of the Environment. The spectre of such
a hybrid may be considered alarming to others.
The report also acknowledges, as we all must, that so much of rural
policy is closely bound up with Europe and the so-called Common
Agricultural Policy -- so far the only European policy that pretends to
any real cohesion in spite of its critics.
The CAP is called upon to do many things -- primarily to ensure a
ready and adequate supply of food to 350 million European consumers and
an adequate income to those that do the providing, but also secondarily
to safeguard the countryside or the rural environment. There are many
who question whether it can do both satisfactorily, particularly as new
pressures -- such as continued expansion to include Central and Eastern
European Countries (CEECs) -- are involved.
The Irish, as always, have it summed up in the old adage: If I was
going there, I wouldn't start from here.
Unfortunately, in the world of real politick, a start has to be made
somewhere. Cuts in hospital services and privatisation of public
utilities have to be balanced against taxpayers' -- as opposed to
consumers' -- willingness to pay for them.
Similarly, rural employment and housing may have to be set against
priorities for towns and cities; demands for a ''pretty'' countryside
will have to be set against the cost of paying farmers to be
park-keepers; the cost of retaining the Fort William sleeper service may
have to be set against that of speeding up the agonisingly slow bit of
the King's Cross to Aberdeen service north of Edinburgh.
What is abundantly clear, particularly from the huge number of bodies
to be consulted, is that more and more people have an interest in the
countryside and the chances of satisfying even a tiny proportion of
these are slim.
What was it that television's Sir Humphrey Appleby said to minister
Jim Hacker about the chances of creating an integrated transport policy?
I can't remember. But a successful integrated rural policy has about the
same chance.

<HEADLINE>New catalytic coating could boost platinum</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>

DEMAND for platinum could double if legislation is enacted to coat car
radiators with catalyst to reduce ozone-created smog in the atmosphere.
On present calculations it is estimated it could cost perhaps #700 to
add a platinum group metal-based catalytic coating to cars as part of
the policy of countering the effects of harmful exhaust emissions.
However, the impetus for the Engelhard-based process would almost
certainly have to begin in California which has traditionally been the
pacemaker in environmental controls. These have included the catalytic
convertor which is now a legal requirement on all European cars built
after December 1993.
The US state has introduced a regulation that will force the US motor
manufacturers to produce 2% of vehicles with zero emission by 1998.
Radiator coating would have to be mandatory as volunteers willing to
spend an appreciable amount without any substantial personal direct
benefit will be limited in number.
Platinum group catalysts, including palladium and rhodium, are used
extensively to reduce the effects of ozone in high-flying passenger
aircraft.
Last year, platinum demand rose by 11% to a record 4.51 million ounces
worth $1830m or about #1150m. The price averaged $405 an ounce, up 8%.
Refiners Johnson Matthey in the Platinum 1995 annual survey expect
that the use of the precious metal will rise again this year in
auto-catalysts, jewellery and industrial applications although less
sharply than in 1994.
The crucial factors are the levels of demand from the US car industry
which increased consumption last year by 32% and the level of buying by
Japan.
That country takes 47% of all production and its jewellery requirement
accounts for 84% of all platinum jewellery usage.
A representative of a Japanese trading house explained that reflected
the demand for very high purity metal with sales of Platinum 1000 very
buoyant and also the high price which is a status symbol.
Global supply and demand were very much in balance. This was due to a
49% increase in Russian sales to 1.01 million ounces or perhaps twice
that country's mine production as stockpiles are run down to generate
foreign exchange.
Johnson Matthey said it has no idea as to the remaining Russian
stocks.
However, there is not a long-term supply problem because of the
substantial resources in South Africa while there are a rising number of
new producers entering the picture such as Zimbabwe.

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle and Courage were strangely reticent about the
historic links between the two companies -- at least as regards national
origins -- when they announced the planned #425m merger last week.
The Courage brewery was established in Southwark in 1787 by John
Courage who was born in Aberdeen. He was the younger son of a Huguenot
family which had fled from France to Scotland about a century earlier.
He arrived in London in 1779 as agent for the Carron Ironworks, then a
major trading company best known for its naval guns.
Carron ships sailed to London to berth at Glasgow Wharf which was
downstream of the Tower of London on the north bank of the Thames.
Rapidly increasing in wealth, Courage decided to go into the beer
business at Horselydown in Southwark -- an area mentioned by Chaucer for
its beer four centuries earlier -- the unfortunate ''dronke'' in the
Miller's Tale in The Canterbury Tales written in 1387 blamed his
unsteadiness ''on the ale of Southwark I you preye.''
The initial investment was a cheque dated December 20, 1787, for the
sum of #616 13s 11d probably payable to John Alliss -- the name of the
payee was omitted. The first brew was made on January 4, 1789 -- 51
gallons at the Anchor Brewhouse.
Brewing became so successful that it soon replaced shipping as his
main interest.
Unfortunately, he could not leave well alone. Although hale and hearty
and in the prime of life, Courage developed parliamentary aspirations
and died suddenly during an election campaign in 1793 to leave his widow
Harriot whose only son was three-year-old John. It had been planned that
John junior would enter the church.
Harriot proved an excellent manager for four years until she passed
away to leave the running of the company in the hands of her managing
clerk John Donaldson who eventually ended up with half the business.

THE main focus of interest this week will be on the first quarter
figures for output, income, and expenditure.
The Central Statistical Office has already estimated that gross
domestic product grew by 0.8% in the first quarter with almost all of
the increase coming from the service sector, despite a dip in retail
sales.
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is sceptical about
the figures which showed that the economy had not slowed down between
the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. The
year-on-year growth rate was 3.9%.
Mr Clarke claimed that GDP figures were at odds with the data on
retail sales and industrial production.
Part of his justification for not raising interest rates on May 5 was
his belief that the economy had, in fact, slowed down.
Wednesday's figures will be closely studied to see if there is any
revision to the first estimate. There will also be great interest in the
figures for consumer spending. This grew by 0.8% in the final quarter of
last year, despite lack-lustre retail sales.
Something similar may have occurred in the first quarter. Spending has
been diverted to holidays, eating out, the National Lottery, and other
services not covered by retail sales.
Later today, the figures for non-European Union trade are expected to
show a modest increase in the April deficit from #263m to around #400m.

ABOUT 60,000 Safeway supermarket workers have an anxious few days
ahead of them as group owner Argyll prepares to announce a huge shake-up
which will include job cuts.
Argyll will announce details of the revamp of Britain's third largest
supermarket chain on Wednesday.
Reports that 1000 jobs will be cut under a plan called Safeway 2000
were yesterday described as ''pure speculation'' by an Argyll
representative.
She said: ''On Wednesday, we make public a very significant review.
There will be a total re-engineering of the whole company. We will say
which jobs are going and what jobs will be created.''
Safeway has been working on its plan for two years and is expected in
the City to make big cuts in middle management and shopfloor jobs.
Argyll's top executives, headed by chief executive Colin Short, will
present the changes planned for the 370-store Safeway chain.
It is thought Safeway will try and hit back at the biggest supermarket
chains Sainsbury and Tesco with consumer offers and significant changes
to stores, possibly including creche facilities.
Argyll, which will also publish its results on Wednesday, has been
forced to make the shake-up because it has seen its share of the grocery
market squeezed by the big two.

* CONFECTIONERY and soft drinks giant Cadbury Schweppes is to build a
factory near St Petersburg to meet soaring Russian demand for Western
chocolate.
Details of the project, costing about #75m, are expected to be
announced this morning.
Cadbury, which already sells one million chocolate bars a day in
Russia, hopes to double its share of the Russian market to 10% by making
confectionery in the country.
It exported 26,000 tonnes of Fruit &amp; Nut, Picnic and Wispa last year,
up threefold over the 1993 level ofsales.
It will also use St Petersburg as a base for exports to other
countries in the former Soviet Union.
Cadbury which has just taken over the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up group of soft
drinks companies for #1570m has in recent months highlighted the growth
potential of the Russian market. In 1994 alone, it tripled confectionery
exports to the country from the previous year's level to 26,000 tonnes.
The company now supplies Russia from plants in Britain and Germany.

Mayfest director Paul Bassett admits this year's festival had good and
bad aspects. But, as John Linklater reports, a rapidly shrinking
deficit, top box office returns and positive public reactions back his
belief that the people of Glasgow have once again embraced the event as
their own.
THERE is no sure way to measure the success of a festival, and the
1995 Mayfest has been significant in setting out a whole new agenda for
itself. You can examine box office returns, and this Mayfest has hit its
targets. You can demand an update on the accumulated deficit (which
peaked at #180,000 earlier this year), but Mayfest will start 1996
without one, which is a major accountancy achievement. These are
starting points, but they fail to tell the full story.
You can talk to the pundits, the arts writers, who have mixed reports
this year with more than the usual level of irritation over poor
liaison, lack of notice for cancelled shows and an apparent reluctance
from Mayfest to promote itself. You can talk to venue managers and
individual companies, and again the feedback is mixed between
enthusiastic acknowledgment of the rebirth of a People's Festival and
continuing grievances over a controversial programme brochure that
blundered, chopped submitted texts, downplayed certain venues, and
ignored cross-referencing or indexing. That row simmered on into the
final week.
Or you can suspend dwelling on what went wrong, and listen to Mayfest
director Paul Bassett about what went right. He has an infectious belief
in his festival's potential to set out in radical new directions,
involving new audiences and scrap-piling a lot of tired old formulae
about the Arts and Community and Culture. He also has his own way of
assessing response. It is to do with the ratio of punches to embraces he
receives from audiences as they come out of the shows.
He is there to collect them. You know where he got this from, after 15
years at the Citizens' Theatre, but standing in the foyer with a
conspicuous Mayfest badge and saying goodnight to everyone as they
leave, gives Bassett reasonable claims to be in touch. ''I'm not overly
concerned with the figures,'' he said. ''I think the really important
factor is the chemistry and spirit of Mayfest. Has it clicked with
people in Glasgow? On that score I would say, merely my response, but
based on what people have said to me, I would say yes it has, it's come
back to the people of Glasgow, it's become a festival that belongs to
them.
''Because we had so little time, all I concentrated on were the shows
we put on and the pitch we were trying to make with the festival towards
a new audience. On those scores, I don't think there's any apology
needed. On the contrary, I think we've made a remarkable achievement.''
No festival director should be judged by the results of their first
year. When, like Bassett, Brian McMaster had only half a year to get his
first Edinburgh Festival together, he suffered a fiasco. It took another
year to get any indication of what he was about. Bassett, who left his
job as general manager at the Citz on September 3, may have run into
problems, but they need to be seen in perspective.
''Yes I think there have been a few bruised feelings,'' he admits.
''But none more than mine. I am painfully aware of what we didn't get
right. My reputation at the Citz, Mr Meticulous and all that, was
severely damaged. People told me I had a reputation for the standard of
the organisation, administration and everything. I let rip on the
programming. That worked. And the lack of administration and control was
a problem.
''But we need to be careful. We could get a very distorted picture.
One of the journalists was still being vitriolic the other night about
the brochure. I accept that reaction, but you have to listen to as many
people as you can and we got a completely different reaction from other
people who said it was a brilliant front cover, with day-by-day
coverage. People who said: 'Thank God you didn't have community theatre
at the back, or theatre, music and dance in separate categories. There
was a lot of positive reaction. There are things to get right in the
future, but the result was it did create a kind of excitement.''
The achievements of this festival are so obvious, they might get
overlooked. Mayfest reversed a trend of allowing itself to become
virtually a fringe on the edge of itself by taking over and running the
complete show at three of the big venues: The King's Theatre, The Shed
at Harland and Wolff and the Mayfest Club at Fruitmarket. At the Shed
alone, the three shows -- Scottish Opera, Donnie Burns and Gaynor
Fairweather, and the War Requiem -- played to audiences totalling 7000.
They offered a new accessibility that reached beyond regular Arts
audiences, but didn't alienate them. Add to that 2000 kids, mainly
female, at Discorama in the SECC, where they were picking up Mayfest
trophies when they might never previously have heard of Mayfest, and the
full-house of under-25s, first-time theatre-goers, who went to the
second night of Robert Lepage's Needles And Opium at the King's on the
strength of word-of-mouth, and the profile of Bassett's new consituency
becomes clearer.
The statement of intent is clear. Mayfest advertised three key
management posts on Friday. The re-cordination of separate financial
years for grants and the Mayfest budget has been seen as a clever
accountancy solution to a deficit that haunted Robert Robson for the
four years of his tenure, and grew at alarming pace the further it was
investigated by the new regime. They start next year liberated from it,
and from a lot of the other baggage that had come to make Mayfest such a
pedestrian target for the pack. The suspicion is they'll find it harder
to work out which way Bassett is moving next. He hates standing still.
''There has to be an edge to what we're doing,'' he said. ''If Mayfest
can't be a bit vanguardist, then who can? We're experimenting. A lot of
this was casting the net on the water to see what would happen. We
didn't know, and to a certain extent we still don't.
''But I think it's difficult when you have institutions, be they arts
councils, departments of performing arts or, for that matter, newspaper
arts pages, where they organize along lines that were maybe set 10 years
ago. The great thing about a festival is that it can be dynamic,
responsive and flexible to cultural changes. If it's a risk we should do
it. If it's safe, we shouldn't.
''The old revolutionary part of me, and the new revolutionary part of
me, is that I do believe in change. To comments like the lack of
cohesion in the music part of the festival, I say: 'God spare us from
cohesion. God spare us from Establishment.' If Mayfest becomes an arts
institution, for God's sake close us down tomorrow, if we haven't closed
ourselves down already.
''I don't think Mayfest has lost its creative heart. If anything, what
we've tried to do this year is to regain the essentials of the buzz of a
festival that does something that people want to go and see and have a
good time at.''

Artist William Crozier was a haemophiliac whose career lasted just one
decade. Clare Henry reports on his short, but productive, life and an
exhibition in Edinburgh which includes some of his work
WINTERS in the south of France with Anne Redpath, or in Italy with
William Gillies. Trips to Sienna, Perugia, and Assisi; a studio shared
with MacTaggart in Edinburgh with a view over the Firth of Forth. Sounds
good? But William Crozier suffered from haemophilia and only enjoyed his
career for one short decade, from 1920 till his death in 1930.
Thus he is the least-known member of the Edinburgh School, but
detective work by Ann Simpson has uncovered much new information and
several finds, including a fine oil of Candlemaker Row, lots of sketches
and photographs, even a ''swop'' from Redpath. These works, along with
30 paintings, 20 watercolours, and prints, make up the exhibition at
Edinburgh's National Gallery of Modern Art.
Crozier was born in Edinburgh in 1893, son of a printer's compositor.
His sister, conscious that she would pass on haemophilia, never had
children, so the family died out, making research more difficult. Art
historians usually leave it too late before capturing contemporary
artists' memories. Now, due to the exhibition, people are phoning up
with snippets of information.
Simpson has managed to establish Crozier's age -- four years older
than previously thought -- and that he attended George Herriot's School
from 1903-9 before a playground accident invalided him for nine months.
Having turned to painting as a way of being creative at his own pace, he
bravely enrolled at Edinburgh College of Art at the age of 22.
At art school, Crozier landed on his feet. A likeable, intelligent man
and good conversationalist, he found himself at the centre of a lively
group of friends who appreciated him ''quite apart from his gifts as a
painter, as a kind of oasis in the illiterate and philistine deserts of
the Scottish studios''.
Still in its first decade in 1916, Edinburgh College of Art was
steadfastly conservative, teachers adhering to the nineteenth-century
academic tradition with its emphasis on tonal analysis to the exclusion
of colour. The college notably failed to recognise the more pioneering
artists who were around at the time, people 15 or 20 years older, like
Peploe, Cadell, and Fergusson. Later, Crozier developed a great
admiration for Peploe and his influence can be seen in Red Roofs,
Pennan, and Cork Trees.
Like MacTaggart, Crozier never completed his Edinburgh diploma course,
but by 1922 was winning prizes at the RSA including a travel award which
took him to Paris. Along with MacTaggart, he was a founder member of the
1922 Group, 11 graduates who, frustrated by lack of exhibition space for
the young, put on their own shows from 1923-31.
Crozier's breakthrough came in Paris where he attended Andre Lhote's
new Academie Montparnasse and studied in the Louvre. Lhote taught
students to reduce a subject to its essential geometry and to use a
limited palette. Derain's 1920s cubist landscapes also had a big impact
on Crozier.
After Paris came Florence -- where Crozier met up with Gillies --
Ravenna and Venice. As with Picasso and Braque previously, the
stacked-up architecture of Tuscan hill towns was to prove a useful
cubist motif, although Crozier never tried abstraction, merely a
simplified geometrical, decorative approach to structure.
His pictures of Edinburgh also used geometric analysis, the cuboid
terraces and gable ends strangely softened as though made from soggy
cardboard. Edinburgh from Salisbury Crags and Edinburgh in Snow are his
best known pictures. These images are very much of the period, Crozier's
muted palette of greys, ochres, and dull browns redolent of the thirties
slump. Tonally low key and dispirited, these lonely grey scenes with
their solitary single figures have a sadness which echoes that difficult
decade.
Towards the end of his life Crozier, by now on the council of the SSA,
a winner of the Guthrie Prize and an ARSA, painted more colourful,
mainly Italian landscapes. His favourite composition of a road winding
into the distance, appears in several including his last, perhaps best
oil, Roslin. A Room with a View, Fiesole, is also a rare summer scene,
vibrant and joyous in reds and gold.
It's important to keep historical discoveries in perspective.
Crozier's is a small talent, and because he went to art school late with
little time to develop due to illness, we can only view his last couple
of pictures and guess what might have been.
''He was my greatest friend,'' said MacTaggart, whose work plus
pictures by Redpath, Gillies, and Peploe from the same period, concludes
the show which runs until July 9.

JULIA LANGDON talks to a women whose love for the country of her
birth, and a stranger she met there, led to a horrifying two-year ordeal
SHE was born in Persia. She was rich and privileged and indulged.
There were Rolls-Royces and servants and designer labels on everything.
Every comfort imaginable was available. But there was also public duty.
She was raised with a sense of service to her country, even though it
was as an exile in Britain from the age of two, and it was probably that
public-spirited upbringing which was to blame for the terrible mistake
that she was to make.
Even today Cherry Mosteshar, or, in full, Parichehreh
Mosteshar-Gharai, cannot speak of some of the indignities that she
suffered when she decided to go back to Iran and, once there, to marry
an Iranian peasant. And it doesn't make it any easier that she brought
this trouble upon herself, that she did it in defiance of her family,
her friends and her own common sense.
As an exile, but as a radical who felt that the excesses of the
Peacock Throne needed to be curbed, she initially sympathised with the
need for some form of revolution in Persia. Today she is horrified by
what has happened and she is a wiser, sadder woman, still dragging
herself out of a nightmare.
She is also very brave. She has written a book about her own ghastly
experience in which she has been startlingly honest, not just in
describing her own errors, stupidity and unbelievable naivete, but also
about all that is going wrong in Iran. In conversation, she starts many
sentences ''As a Persian . . . '' or ''As a Muslim . . .''. She
frequently quotes from the Koran to make a critical point about the
present regime in Iran, and she is obviously running something of a risk
in being so outspoken.
But she believes it is time to withstand the distortion of her faith
that she believes is being practised by the fundamentalist movement --
''the most destructive thing that has ever happened to Islam: all the
things that are great and precious about the religion are being stamped
into the ground in their march towards murder and hatred and terrorism''
-- and she is not prepared to be scared. After what she has already been
through, that is perhaps understandable.
''I really believe it is time that people stopped being afraid,'' she
says defiantly when we meet and I ask her about this. She is pretty,
blonde with dark eyes, smartly dressed with lots of jewellery and she
seems to exude self-confidence. She would not be easy to intimidate. She
goes on: ''They have used information, they have used Salman Rushdie --
the threat of the fatwah -- to make people very, very worried of what
they are writing about them. In my book there is absolutely nothing that
goes against Islamic law,'' she pauses, reflecting, and then adds,
''however, I don't think that would stop them if they wanted to send a
signal out.''
That is why she is brave. But in a way, sending a signal out is
exactly what she herself has done with her book. For despite the
seriousness of the subject, she has written a lively, funny, human
account of the nature of life in Teheran today.
That was, in fact, her original objective: her mistake was in
believing that she could do exactly that as a journalist working in Iran
for Western newspapers -- believing that she could remain a modern,
liberated, Westernised woman.
The authorities are constantly pilloried in her book. She shows their
repressive nature, details the difficulties put in her way when seeking
sometimes just to enter a press conference because she is allegedly
improperly dressed or has the wrong sort of socks on.
She became a journalist because she came from a family that had always
''done things, played a part in history''. Two of her relatives in her
mother's generation were journalists. ''The rest of the family were
either ministers or generals. I had this naive idea that as soon as
people read what I wrote, I could change the world. ''
Her immediate family came to live in Britain when her parents
separated, but she visited her homeland often. She went there for a
short time after studying at university here and worked for the
television station in Teheran. This was just before the revolution.
It was as a more experienced journalist, having worked in Hong Kong,
then on the Birmingham Post, as a sports editor on freesheets in North
London, and for a number of national British newspapers, that she felt
the need to return, this time with her mission to explain that Islam was
not all evil.
Now she feels a part of both countries, but no longer recognises the
existence of the Persia to which she once belonged, a place she
cherished, a place now being slowly destroyed, she says, by the
political system imposed upon it. And that is even though she recognised
the need for change: if you were rich in Persia, you could do anything,
have anything. There were no checks on your behaviour. She remembers
some wealthy young hooligans going out in a car once saying: ''Let's
knock over a few pedestrians.''
She was working for the Independent, Observer and Economist but she
was watched all the time. She was constantly asked by the Iranian
authorities to spy on her fellow journalists. She was invited to inform
by one Western government. She was assumed to be a spy by others.
Everything was difficult and she was lonely. Then she met this man, who
worked for one of the ministries. She calls him Muhammad.
''He was so charming. He believed in everything I believed in. He knew
an awful lot about the way the system worked and about how Islam worked.
He had brothers who had been murdered. I mistook knowledge for wisdom.
Then there was pressure for me either to marry him or not to see him
again. If we were caught out together the consequences were so dire: in
our case because he was with the ministry and I was a journalist; we
would be accused of spying.''
She was 36, she had suffered from a gynaecological problem, she felt
she had always run away from relationships; she decided that this time
she should, as she puts it, ''go for it''. She had her doubts when she
met his family, but excused them all on the basis of her own snobbery,
her own privilege. She married him.
And it was only later, after the ghastly indignities of the marriage
rituals in modern Iran, which were bad enough, that she discovered that
he was already married and that he was a bully, and that he was lazy,
and that he intended that she should adopt the hejab, go under the veil,
and that practically everything he told her was a lie. Then he gave up
his job, developing what she describes as ''total paralysis of his arms
and legs''. He humiliated her sexually as well. There are things she
does not describe: what she does report is beastly enough.
In the book she writes: ''I was expected to cook and clean and
entertain; I was expected to discard all my traditions and adopt his,
and in my spare time I was expected to earn enough to support him, his
other wife and children, and to feed and house his friends and family.''
Somehow she managed to get the courage to break away. He came after
her to England, but after some months returned to Iran. She admitted a
lot of things to herself about her errors, her judgment, her place in a
society in which she had wanted to belong. ''It was almost as if I was
betraying Iran if I left him.''
She realises now that is not so, and hopes by exposing something of
what is going on, by drawing attention to the repression of women by
fundamentalism, by becoming active in British politics -- she has been a
member of the Labour Party for some years and wants to become an MP --
that she can still try to help change things in a tiny way. She is still
haunted by the woman she became, the one who stayed in Teheran for two
years while her real self kept shouting ''Run! Run!'', and the idea of
any kind of relationship with another man horrifies her.
It will get better, she says. She is working for the Independent
again, living with her mother in comfort in Oxford, and planning her
next book about the lives of Muslims in Britain. It sounds safer.

Brussels,
CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will join European Union
Finance Ministers in Brussels today when they are expected to approve a
new law providing protection for small investors.
After 18 months of debate the ministers are on the point of agreeing
formally to provide legal cover for at least #16,000 in cases where
companies become insolvent. The money will go in such cases to
individuals who entrusted their money or securities to investment firms.
Signing up for the deal is expected to be a formality after the
European Commission produced a new set of rules after several revisions
mainly caused by the fact that some European Union member states already
provide better basic cover for small investors.
EU states which provide more generous protection will not be permitted
to ''export'' it to cover activities abroad because this, according to
the commission, would be unfair and would conflict with EU competition
law. But a branch from one country would be allowed to join its host
country's scheme if it is better.
The new rules will come into affect 18 months after the scheme is
published in the EU's Official Journal.
That could mean another long delay because the European Parliament in
Strasbourg must give the new legislation a second reading. As a result
investors could wait another two years before they receive the benefit.
Sophisticated instruments such as financial futures will be excluded
from the new rules. Investors in such products are presumed to be in a
better position to assess risk and usually trade in much larger amounts
of money.
Professional investors and large corporate concerns are not covered in
the rules which are aimed at modest investors of savings and small sums.
EU Finance Ministers will also meet their counterparts from several
former Communist bloc states who are in the queue for EU membership.
The question of closing down the troubled Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine
at a cost of several billion pounds is also on the agenda with EU
Ministers considering how to help with financing the work.

KIM Fowley's 30-odd years in rock'n'roll constitutes a terrific secret
history. Despite having hung out with John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band;
traded surrealistic phrases with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention, and
pulled Svengali-like strings for seminal she-rockers the Runaways, Los
Angelino Fowley remains a shadowy enigma whose somewhat sleazy persona
seeps sporadically through the more tattered seams of rock's rich
tapestry.
In London to preview his latest maverick solo album -- Let The Madness
In -- and to promote the Creation label's reissue of one of his early
LPs, Fowley was abetted on-stage by several Creation luminaries,
including Ride's Andy Bell on guitar and several members of jangly
support band 18 Wheeler.
What did we get? A shambolic evening of prurient ranting and noisy
garage rock that remained unadorned by the celebrity stars the pre-show
blurb had promised. It was, however, shot through with Fowley's
miscreant musings on sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll.
Fowley's imposing, leather-jacketed frame wandered the stage with
casual malevolence. He ''sang'' in a voice of gravelly atonality. When
he wasn't handing the microphone to audience-members, he was stopping
songs mid-verse to reply to hecklers. Fowley's apparently irony free
putdowns -- of the ''Hey buddy, I knew Jim Morrison'' variety -- seemed
enough for an audience willing to indulge his egocentric whimsicality.
Overall then, despite a rumbustious version of his 1965 psychedelic
classic The Trip, the show was little more than the airing of an
impeccable ligger's CV, and an illustration that an air of studied
insanity is a surefire means of guaranteeing acceptance by the
demi-monde.

Durban, Sunday
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela ventured into the volatile Zulu
heartland today, brushing aside concerns for his safety a day after
shots were fired at a funeral he attended.
Mandela toured two trouble-torn areas of KwaZulu-Natal province,
telling his African National Congress supporters that he would not be
threatened by political criminals and would visit every corner of the
country.
''Those who say I should not go to some places in KwaZulu-Natal are
idiots. I will go all over KwaZulu-Natal to show I am the president of
the whole of South Africa,'' he told 4000 villagers attending the
reinstatement of a tribal chief at Gcilima, near the port city of
Durban.
The original venue for the event was abandoned after neighbouring
chiefs said Mandela was not welcome.
''Next time I come here, I want this meeting at that venue. Nobody is
going to tell my people that they cannot meet at a particular place,''
said Mandela.
While some officials said the 76-year-old president was not threatened
by yesterday's incident, when his party security fired into the air to
disperse a crowd beating a man, others said they had been concerned for
his safety.
When he last visited the province three weeks ago, he was evacuated in
an armoured car from a rally in which six people were wounded by
gunfire.
Some 600 soldiers and policemen were deployed for today's
visit.--Reuter.

UNTIL MODE appeared, the biggest excitement had been the fire alert
which obliged the audience to take its interval drinks out into the
night. Support band Coolgroove had turned out some efficient modal funk,
but are still too young, too wholesome, and slightly too derivative to
excite. Trumpeter Colin Steele, however, a youth with a manic spark in
his eye and his attack, has fiery hard-bop sensibilities of
unmistakeable promise.
In contrast, MODE tore it apart within seconds of starting and kept it
there for what must have been 90 minutes but seemed much less. Ex-Jazz
Warrior and one-time Coltrane disciple Williamson is no new 'Trane for
his generation. Not as a soloist, anyway, but as chief pilot of MODE he
leads the most thrilling sextet I've heard for years. Superbly tight,
bad-assed and loud, they blew up a tornado of precisely arranged, evil
funk that roared off the stage, taking no prisoners.
Electric bass and drums, keyboard and guitar, they resembled Defunkt
by way of M:BASE, while Williamson, mostly on tenor, sometimes on
soprano, let fly a storm of intense, speed-of-light, wild harmonics
delirium. He's his own man, but you can't miss the echoes of Coltrane,
Shepp and, above all, mid-period Sanders.
The sixth member, vocalist Sophia Jones, looked like she'd just
stepped off the cover of Miles Davis's On The Corner album. She
periodically added a cooler, more loose-limbed texture to the set. MODE
are original and terrifyingly good.

THIS is turning out to be a very good Opposition; not only that, a
lucky one. Blair and Brown, his Shadow Chancellor, steadfastly refuse to
provide hostages to fortune while the Tories destroy their fortunes with
hostages by the train load. Or is it Thatcher load? Today Blair, having
pronounced Clause 4 dead, is expected to do the same for Keynesian
economics and hitch himself to a low inflation, steady growth policy for
government. Who can quarrel with that, so long as he does not promise
full employment? He does not.
He declares for a minimum wage, but he will not accede to the demands
of some trade unionists that a level should be fixed now. Furthermore,
the minimum wage might be a variable item, hitched to regional cost of
living and employment markets.
Somehow Blair has to get round the observation of his deputy, John
Prescott, that a minimum wage will affect jobs.
He has of course signed up for the European Union Social Chapter, a
prime piece of ''old Labour'' socio-industrial engineering but, like
Major, he will look at a single EU currency if and when the time comes.
He resists the temptation to be precise about interest rates and
sterling, even if it makes his economic policy a trifle patchy.
We are led to believe that devaluation will not be an easy option for
an incoming Labour government. And heaven forbid that his administration
will be a high tax one. Well, top-rate payers will suffer a bit, maybe.
The absence of precise commitment is very irritating for the Tories
who believe that if they have at last got one thing right it is the
economy. Yesterday Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was trying hard again to
unpick the Blair/Brown position.
The emperor has no clothes, he claims. But nobody seems to notice, or
care. Why? For one thing, the second volume of the Thatcher memoirs is
imminent and it points out that Major has no clothes, or rather, he is
wearing the wrong clothes. Her successor lacks a sense of purpose and
his policies are misguided, she states.
That feel-good factor is just as far away as ever, but time is running
out. It must be very galling for Clarke. For example, having delivered,
off his own bat, more public independence to Eddie George, the Governor
of the Bank of England, he is traduced for making his own decision last
week about pegging interest rates. Perversely, Brown refuses to tell
Clarke whether he would have done the same, preferring to talk up the
suggestion of a row between the Chancellor and the Governor.
As it turns out Clarke seems to have made the right decision in view
of the latest figures on high street sales and the housing market.
Sterling took a bump at first but recovered as the pundits observed that
the cost of borrowing should be pegged after all, at least for another
month.
By the time the minutes of the ''Ken and Eddie'' meeting are published
(another Clarke reform), the so-called row may have evaporated entirely.
From what I hear, the monthly meetings are a kind of nicotine joust
between cigarette-smoking Eddie and cheroot-puffing Ken. Acrimony does
not feature. Clarke claims that the ''Ken and Eddie'' show (as he
himself calls it) has a good track record.
Certainly the Chancellor was able to despatch with ease allegations
made by Labour in the Commons. The Tories have not been too pleased with
their Chancellor recently (he's either too this or too that for those
looking for a new leader), but a robust Commons performance by him,
seeing-off the Opposition, gladdens their sad, sad hearts.
Blair is not only fresh, young, handsome, and articulate, they must
think, but he is damnably lucky. He is leading Labour at a time when he
can do pretty well what he likes with it. Major by contrast is unlucky.
It falls to him to lead a party reluctant to give him anything he wants.
Every horse Blair backs seems to come in; Major's selection is fortunate
to make it to the start.
What is it? Bad reading of the form book? Too much adherence to that
last bit of ''advice'' to get to him just before the off? Careless talk
and actions by other Tories who seem determined to double up on their
selections to try to recoup their losses?
I suppose we might have expected Margaret Thatcher to produce another
stick with which his right wing can beat him. She left the Tories with a
majority of 93. It has now slumped to about nine. It is not that she is
challenging his leadership, you understand; it is just that she picked
the wrong one to succeed.
And now Sir Edward Heath, the leader before her, is sufficiently upset
with him to set off a Tory revolt on the Nolan report into members'
conduct. He knows Major broadly accepts the Nolan recommendations --
after all, it was he who set up the Nolan enquiry and told him to get on
with it -- but Sir Edward, Father of the House, rejects them. His
judgment is that misdemeanours are few and this reaction to them is way
over the top.
He was supported in Thursday night's debate by a succession of Tory
back benchers who seem to think that the Nolan inquiry, having been
established as a permanent custodian of the standards of public life,
can be ignored. The revolt beached the unfortunate Commons leader, Tony
Newton, whose job it was to wind up.
It seemed like a bright idea to announce the establishment of a
committee to consider the Nolan committee. At least it might buy a bit
of time; but it looked like Government vacillation and it encouraged
nothing but scorn on all sides. The Prime Minister really only has one
credible option and that is to announce he intends to proceed with the
recommendations and put it to a vote.
Labour would back him and those Tory back benchers who want to make
fools of themselves could do so. Then they could do so again by
challenging his leadership in November. Major should be so lucky.

SHE's 96, pretty frail, but pretty spunky. Which is maybe why they
took a couple of days to find she had broken her hip after a fall. She
was taken to hospital and waited another day because there wasn't a slot
for her operation immediately.
But she's pretty spunky. So she pulled through and began to heal. The
physiotherapist, discovering she had a cancellation in transportation,
booked her a home visit to test out her suitability for discharge. When
the moment came, it was clear this could be filed under the heading of
crazy optimism. An old woman who can't yet walk or stand is not going to
make much of a fist of trying to climb the daunting stairs of her
council home. In any case her carer is her sister. A woman in her
mid-eighties with a permanent limp from a distant operation.
The home visit was re-scheduled for the following week. With a
superhuman effort she made the stairs, exhausted by the time she reached
her bedroom. It was deemed possible for her to be discharged pending the
fitting of a second stair rail and the delivery of equipment to make
toileting easier.
She went back into hospital. Two unrelated problems emerged; a painful
heel injury which made it difficult to place any weight on the leg, and
a bladder infection. But she was told she would be discharged anyway.
The staff were under huge pressure to find another seven beds by the
next day.
She came home in an ambulance and was carried into the house. It was
soon clear she couldn't even get to the downstairs loo by zimmer, let
alone climb the stairs to sleep.
Her sister, by now also distressed, called the district nurse. This
took a little while since the local one was out on another call and one
had to be despatched from another town. The nurse tried everything she
knew, but couldn't help the patient up the stairs. In fact she was
forced to leave her sitting there while she contacted a GP. It was, by
now, mid evening. The nurse and the doctor carried her upstairs and put
her into bed.
She is still there because she cannot go back downstairs. Because of
her bladder infection she constantly needed to go to the loo during the
night.
Because of her heel injury she required the assistance of her sister
every time to reach the commode from the bed.
The nurse comes to wash her. The hospital social worker comes to
assess her.
It is apparent to both of them that she can neither stay upstairs, nor
negotiate the route downstairs. Clearly she should not have left her
hospital bed. But she has. And the chances of re-admittance would seem
to be nil.
So they have arranged that a hospital-style bed will be delivered and
put in the middle of her living room. Not many living rooms are designed
for this purpose, so her sister has arranged for a charity to come to
remove some of their furniture to accommodate the bed.
Unfortunately, owing to local holidays, this will not be possible
immediately.
They hope, perhaps by next Tuesday, the bed will arrive. Meanwhile she
stays marooned upstairs. Her sister stays marooned downstairs since she
cannot leave the house. People help with her shopping, but she wants to
go out herself. Not least because there is another sister in hospital
whom she had been visiting almost daily before this accident.
The social worker is trying to arrange for some weekly respite for her
from the charity Crossroads, which specialises in this kind of
situation. But it is oversubscribed and may not be available for a
couple of weeks. In some areas it has ceased operations because of lack
of finance.
This is not a story about negligence. All of the health-care
professionals involved have been unfailingly concerned about the old
lady's welfare. But all of them face intolerable frustrations.
The medical staff who prepared her for discharge must have known it
was inappropriate. But they knew too that half a dozen equally urgent
admissions would be arriving the next day. The physiotherapist and the
social worker knew that one frail elderly person looking after a second
does not constitute adequate support, but they are juggling bulging
caseloads of their own.
The district nurse will continue to bring her skills round once a day,
knowing that they will have to find their own ways of coping for the
next 23[1/2] hours but unable to clone herself to do much about it.
I hope to God that case is not typical. But the fact that it can
happen, and it did, vividly illustrates why every health-care union,
including those for whom moderation in all things was a watchword which
sometimes enraged their fellow workers, is now at terminal loggerheads
with the department of health.
It's not just about cash, though it would be positively saintly not to
care that you are deemed one-quarter as valuable as one of the new breed
of hospital bureaucrats. The new administrative classes who create the
pressures which allow such situations to arise.
It's about trained people in a caring profession no longer being
permitted to do the job they trained for. Being forced into offering
levels of care and support they know to be inadequate. Having too many
patients supervised at night by too few staff. Having people discharged
too swiftly after surgery. Having no time left for anything other than
the basics in their ward duties. We should be thankful that they care
enough to rebel; that finally they're mad as hell and they aren't going
to take any more. Not least from a junior health minister with a smarm
count that's gone off the Richter scale.

GODS and demons, battles and supernatural happenings -- all these, and
more, are to be found in The Ramayana. Now the Mitchell Theatre is,
perhaps, a small arena for such epic adventures but a real flavour of
the story's colour and magic did come through in the version staged for
Mayfest by the Glasgow-based Abhinaya Darpan dance company.
From first to last, this was a production that set out to tell the
tale of Rama in a way that would be accessible to all age groups and to
those unfamiliar with the characters and situations of Indian myth and
legend. Before each half, a narrator gave a vivid synopsis (in English)
while illustrations from a typical Indian story book were projected on
to a screen at the back of the set. Thereafter the action unfolded in a
mix of mime and dance, all accompanied by specially prepared music and
singing.
The company itself was a mix of ages and communities -- performers
from Bombay swelling the ranks of local recruits. And yes, there was a
range of ability and expertise: some of the young dancers were more
confident, more versed in technique than others, while not everyone had
the poise and exquisite carriage of Rama, as bow in hand he processed
elegantly round the stage on his journey into exile.
But, somehow, this didn't diminish the overall effect of the piece.
Probably because everyone -- from the tiniest tot scampering on as a
member of the Monkey-king's army to the practised performer playing
Haruman himself -- was so earnestly giving of their best. Behind the
scenes, busy hands had created some truly gorgeous costumes -- the stage
blazed with colourful finery while the wicked Ravana's helmet of many
faces gave a new twist to the term ''head-dress''. In all, a very
welcome and engaging glimpse of Indian culture and traditions rounding
off Glasgow's Mayfest.

THE BBC celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of The Composers Guild of
Great Britain with a concert dominated by modern Scottish composers. One
of Thea Musgrave's most recent works, Autumn Sonata, a concerto for bass
clarinet and orchestra, received its Scottish premiere. Commissioned and
brilliantly performed by the young clarinetist Victoria Soames, the
piece is based on fragments of poems by the Austrian Georg Trakl.
Trakl's dark and sometimes violent symbolic imagery which anticipates
the horrors of the First World War is reflected in this eerie
composition which is yet another one of Musgrave's explorations into
projecting and maintaining dramatic situations in her music. Musgrave's
gestural style lends itself naturally to the depiction of dreamlike,
nightmarish scenes, recalling the memory of war.
The piece opens slowly, progressing menacingly, conveying dramatic
urgency through a pulsing percussive beat, to its culmination in a
pounding march. In the aftermath, the opening is recalled with a ghostly
off-stage bass clarinet shadowing the soloist. The concerto ends in a
rather surprisingly direct quotation, almost Ivesian in character, of
Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, another nocturnal and dream-evoking piece.
Iain Hamilton was 28 when he wrote his Second Symphony. Given that it
is the work of a young man, this large-scale piece shows an acute sense
of drama, emphasising complex textures and embracing extremes of
expressive contrasts.

HERE is a tale which comes into the now-it-can-be-told category. Quite
soon the new British Ambassador to the United States will take up
residence in the tied cottage in Washington which comes with the best
job in the United Kingdom's diplomatic service.
Sir John Kerr will move to Washington from Brussels where for the past
five years he has been the UK permanent representative to the European
Union. Not bad for a Glasgow Academy boy.
Sir John is the chap you always see on news bulletins one step behind
the Prime Minister or Foreign Secretary or Chancellor at the great
European occasions. He is the ultimate political minder, a whiz as an
after-dinner speaker and author of one of the best throwaway lines you
could hope to hear: ''When I was writing the Maastricht Treaty . . .''
He smooths the way for Ministers in what must be the toughest job in
the Foreign Office these days. Let's face it, in the current climate
some exceptional diplomatic skills are essential if British Ministers
are to rub along with their EU counterparts. They do, mostly. Sir John
Kerr has earned his money.
Well, now that he is moving on it's probably time to tell of the part
he played in resolving a little spot of diplomatic difficulty which
faced the small Scottish press corps in Brussels a couple of years ago.
When I arrived in Brussels in September, 1992, I wondered if the whole
European adventure was about to collapse. The French had almost
scuppered Maastricht, the pound was about to be expelled from the
exchange rate mechanism, almost causing the resignation of John Major,
and the British presidency of the EU was in crisis. In these
circumstances it was vital to know at first hand what our Government was
up to. The man to turn to was Sir John. Like all senior Government
figures he was happy to chat with journalists at occasional briefings.
But Sir John also held rather more valuable little discussions, usually
over lunch, for smaller groups of correspondents.
The problem was that those private and much-valued briefings excluded
the Scottish press. It was, we were told, unfortunate, but it was
traditional and nothing could be done. The invitees were the five London
broadsheets, two news agencies, and the BBC.
You can imagine our reaction. With my colleague from the Scotsman we
demanded an end to this blatant discrimination. We were, after all, in
direct competition with the London papers while paying just as much as
them for the substantial cost of a presence in Brussels.
We were given three reasons by a somewhat embarrassed official. First,
these exclusive briefings were -- a lovely phrase -- ''London-centric''.
Second, Cabinet Ministers did not read the Scottish press (which is
almost certainly true with one obvious exception). Three (my favourite),
if newspaper readers in Scotland wanted to find out what was happening
in Brussels they could buy the London papers.
It is fair to say that a certain amount of expletives flew along with
the fur but we took a decision, my colleague and I, to deal with this by
means of diplomacy rather than by giving the Foreign Office the
front-page treatment. Word did reach some politicians and at one point I
almost had to use physical restraint on Winnie Ewing to prevent her from
grabbing the nearest telephone and calling Downing Street.
Scottish Office Ministers began to show concern and our editors took
up the cause. It was all resolved amicably and without a public fuss.
Today the Scottish papers are treated as equals and the Foreign Office
is no longer in the business of metropolitan myopia. We were victims of
the old story: the London-only policy was in place simply because it was
tradition, and in the United Kingdom there is no more immovable force
than precedent.
Sir John wasn't even aware of our indignation until it was drawn to
his attention, and he quickly put it right. Last week it was our turn to
take Sir John to lunch and gently to express the hope that his
successor, Mr Stephen Wall, did not slip into any bad old Foreign Office
habits such as thinking of Britain as England.
Sir John was in good form. His most satisfying moment during his time
in Brussels? No doubt about that. It came during a long night of
infighting over the share-out of aid to the needier regions of the EU.
Britain had been told the Highlands and Islands was in line for lots of
money but that Argyll and part of the North-east had been struck from
the proposed aid map.
A great tussle ensued over days of negotiation during which Jacques
Delors decided to intervene personally. ''What exactly is it you want?''
he demanded of Sir John. ''And how can we fix it?''
Sir John explained that Argyll and a lump of the North-east, including
part of Moray, had been left off the map (for good reasons, it should be
said) and that he wanted them put back in.
''How can you justify that?'' Delors asked. Sir John responded:
''Well, I am only asking for what the European Parliament also asked.''
''Is this right?'' Delors asked an aide. Assured that it was, Delors,
a supporter of the Parliament, shrugged: ''We have lost.''
Which is how Sir John Kerr came to win back support for Argyll and
part of Moray. What he did not tell Delors at the time is that the
little bit of Speyside which now benefits from all this Euro-money is
the birthplace of Sir John Kerr.
Washington is an old stamping ground. He was head of chancery there
from 1984 to 1987 and loves the place. Any talk of the ''special
relationship'' being in decline meets with a growl of disapproval.
Indeed, he would happily see the phrase struck from the language
because, he believes, it usually provokes misunderstanding.
Being a diplomat he would never admit his new job will be tougher than
it might once have been. Yet there is no doubt that the Americans appear
to be warming to Germany as the main player in the new Europe while
cooling on the Atlantic alliance. In the Kerr view, however, the British
will always remain the touchstone for Americans when they seek to gauge
opinion on European issues.
In one respect his job will be tougher still. Sir John Kerr is an
alarmingly heavy cigarette smoker heading for America at a time of
anti-smoking near hysteria. But his timing is good: the latest American
fad is smoker-only restaurants.

WHAT a night. A night for the record books, and for record decibel
levels, as Scotland's leading brass players and percussionists gathered
to pay tribute to Maurice Temple, the retiring head of brass at the
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.
There was only one name for such a one-off group, and it was duly
given in the programme: The Brass of Scotland. And, with the exception
of a few individuals and the full-time brass of the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra (on tour in South America), they were all there -- the Royal
SNO, Scottish Opera, the BBC SSO, the Scottish Ballet orchestra, almost
all the leading freelance players, and top students of the RSAMD.
Maurice Temple's heart must have filled at the sight of his former
colleagues and cronies assembled in a unique band. It was quite a sight.
But nothing compared with the sound; 80 players, and all of them
cutting loose. Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man, with first 17
trumpets then 17 horns thundering out the theme with four timpanists,
wasn't just loud; it was awesome. Likewise at the other end of the
programme, with an ear-splitting version of the Spitfire Prelude and
Fugue. In between, a series of showpieces, all conducted by David James:
the Fireworks Music (bit stodgy), some early fanfareish stuff for
various brass combinations, a beautiful Debussy Syrinx with guest
trumpeter Martin Winter from the BBC Phil, and the Academy Brass, who
stole the show with some American jazz.
There was even a new piece, composed for the occasion by Anthony Plog,
Fanfare for MT, a spiky little aphorism of a tribute. All in, a night
Maurice Temple will remember. And the rest of us too.

COCKY cockney bad boys East 17 fit into no particular genre. Hip-hop,
pure pop, funk, rock, and what they describe as ''swing-beat'' are all
on the agenda of this four-piece ensemble of tattoos and testosterone.
But it doesn't really matter which slot they fit in to. They don't care.
So long as they're belting out the numbers and have a suitable number of
young fillies swooning at the flash of a smile, they're happy.
Did I care? Well . . . no. They belted out the numbers quite
satisfactorily, and for a band who are ultimately cooler than their
all-male counterparts, they carry it off in quite a slick, professional
manner. Lead singer Brian Harvey has a nice wee voice on him and
front-man Tony Mortimer, whose mouth seemed to be connected via some
unknown nerve to his pelvis, is an impressive rapper.
As a group they work well together, and the fact that their talents
are more diverse than their peers should be commended.
But something is rotten in Walthamstow. They may have a winning
formula at the moment but their on-stage attitude was less than
admirable. Every girl in that crowd felt as though Tony Mortimer's
piercing blue eyes were looking straight at her -- and he knew it. Once
he had caught the attentions of some flirty fans he appeared to forget
that the reason he was there was to perform for a crowd.
I felt sorry for the thousands of adoring others in the hall.
Thankfully, however, they left most of the sexy dancing to the entourage
of sexy dancers and just pumped their way through a multitude of hits
and hits-to-be.

LISBON: A British man was feared dead after the Cessna plane he was
piloting man crashed into the sea near Portugal's Berlenga islands
yesterday. A rescue operation recovered some pieces of wreckage from the
plane and a lifejacket, but the pilot's body had not been found. A navy
spokesman said both the plane's engines failed on a flight from the
Azores to the northern Portuguese city of Oporto.

MARY CHASE'S play Harvey was first seen on Broadway in late 1944 and
some years later in London with Sid Field. It wears its age well. It
requires above all a leading man of quiet charm and conviction. Gorden
Kaye is just such an actor and his American co-star Rue McClanahan has
loads of verve, a well-honed comic sense, and immaculate timing.
It's 20 years since Elwood P Dowd and his enormous invisible white
rabbit Harvey last put in an appearance in the West End. On that
occasion, James Stewart was repeating his film success. Now it's the
turn of 'Allo 'Allo's Rene, Gorden Kaye, who brings the play
triumphantly back to the West End, to the Shaftesbury Theatre. It's a
strongly cast revival, adroitly directed by Clifford Williams. Rue
McClanahan, from the successful sitcom The Golden Girls, is on top form
as Dowd's sister who tries to get him committed to an asylum, but ends
up being admitted there herself.
Of course the story doesn't end there: Harvey is a comedy. By the end
of the evening both she and the head of the clinic have admitted seeing
the rabbit for themselves. Harvey is still a delightful play after more
than 50 years. On a serious note in its questioning of society's views
on sanity it may well have influenced Joe Orton and the authors of
Anyone Can Whistle among others.

Hong Kong, Sunday
POLICE transferred all but a handful of a resisting group of boat
people scheduled for transfer from a violence-stricken Vietnamese
detention centre in Hong Kong today, and calm returned to the camp as
dusk fell.
In stark contrast to yesterday's scenes of mayhem and bloodshed when
the transfer began, today's operation passed uneventfully.
Almost 200 people, mostly police, were injured when 1300 boat people
violently resisted transfer from Whitehead to another camp yesterday.
Some hurled stones, home-made spears, and debris from their perches on
corrugated iron rooftops. Inmates in other sections of the camp, which
houses at least 10,000 people, joined in, setting fires and harrying
police and prison officers from all sides.
The authorities responded to the day-long resistance by peppering the
camp with hundreds of volleys of teargas and spraying inmates with water
cannon.
Police reinforcements were called in as the trouble spread to other
sections of the camp.
Lawyers for the human rights group Refugee Concern demanded an inquiry
into the use of teargas when so many children were involved.
Around 22,000 Vietnamese boatpeople are incarcerated in prison-like
camps in Hong Kong. They are classified as economic migrants and are
ineligible for refugee status. Hong Kong says they have no choice but to
return to Vietnam.--Reuter.

Kinshasa, Sunday,
ZAIREANS delving into deep-rooted traditional beliefs to explain the
Ebola virus epidemic have come up with bizarre tales of a power struggle
among medical workers, a swallowed diamond, and a white doctor who
turned into a hippopotamus.
As scientists use medical records and computers to track the source of
the virus, which has killed 101 people, townsfolk and villagers swop
their own theories by word of mouth.
According to the most persistent version, the virus was brought to the
town of Kikwit by a man who fell ill after returning from an illegal
diamond mining adventure in Angola.
One variation says he had swallowed a priceless diamond to fool his
benefactors into believing it was lost. He died after doctors at Kikwit
hospital cut him open and removed the gem. His angry father then
consulted powerful witch-doctors, who brought the plague on medical
staff at the hospital.
Records at Kikwit hospital identify the first Ebola victim, who died
after an operation on March 27, simply as Mr Kimbabu.
Nearly all nurses who took part in that operation or had contact with
him have died from Ebola, and in turn infected many more staff there and
at two other hospitals.
Kikwit doctors dismiss the diamond tale as nonsense but the World
Health Organisation says it will follow every lead in the search for
Ebola's home, including the alleged Angola trail.
''We have to pursue the investigation as far as we can,'' said WHO
regional director Deo Barakamfitiye.
Another local theory says Ebola was spread by a South African-based
American virologist who ran a seminar on Aids at Kikwit. The white
doctor transformed himself into a hippopotamus and disappeared into the
nearby Kwilu river.
''It is a poison. It is certainly a settling of scores among
doctors,'' a resident told a French radio interviewer.
In the capital Kinshasa, speculation has a more political tone.
''It's the Angolans who did it,'' said hotel driver Jean-Pierre Bonga.
He claimed witch-doctors in Luanda had come up with a powerful plague
to punish Zaireans for President Mobutu Sese Seko's support of Angolan
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
''Zaireans are very superstitious. For us there is no natural death.
There is always an external cause,'' said taxi driver Eric Mingiedi.
Zaireans say Mobutu, a Christian, surrounds himself with marabouts,
practitioners of traditional magic who are part of the entourage of most
West and Central African presidents.
Many African football teams still consult their witch-doctor before
big games. Riots have often erupted with goalkeepers accused of planting
magical objects between the goalposts.
Missionaries in Gabon say infant sacrifice is still common in the
Central African state. ''No-one dares talk about it or investigate it,
because it has to do with seeking power and it involves the high-ups,''
one priest said.
An angry mob recently lynched a man in Nigeria's main city Lagos. A
young man in the crowd had screamed that he had suddenly become impotent
after shaking the victim's hand.
Meanwhile, travellers and lorries from the virus-stricken Bandundu
province poured into the Zairean capital Kinshasa today after the
lifting of a blockade aimed at containing the outbreak.
However residents' relief over food deliveries was tempered by concern
that the trucks may have brought the virus in their cargo.
Officials imposed the blockade some 10 days ago at Mongata, about 90
miles from Kinshasa, to prevent the spread of one of the worst diseases
known to man to the capital's five million people.
The virus, spread by contact with blood or bodily fluids, causes
uncontrollable bleeding. It first surfaced in the town of Kikwit, 300
miles east of the capital.
A spokesman said the WHO was setting up a field laboratory in Kikwit
to test for the virus, to try to find out where it lives between
outbreaks in humans.--Reuter.

JOHN ROBERTSON (ed.) A Union for Empire: Political Thought and the
Union of 1707 #35, Cambridge University Press
THE mythology of the Union makes it, according to taste, either a
story of base treachery -- or the triumphant fulfilment of a historical
destiny. This book places it in a wider, and enriching, framework.
Scotland's situation after 1603, of sharing a Crown with England, was
far from unusual in the European context. The examples are in fact
legion: Spain and Portugal, Poland and Lithuania, the Swiss
Confederation, the United Netherlands, the Holy Roman Empire and others
-- all partook of a sovereignty in some sense divided.
The fact that it was so commonplace gave rise to a body of political
thought which the modern age of the sovereign nation-state, fixated on
its own assumptions, has ignored. The 13 authors of the present
collection set out to remedy that, and in the process deepen our insight
into the motives and actions of both English and Scots in 1707.
They overegg the pudding in one respect. The volume starts off in
forbidding fashion, to push a new grand idea about international
politics at the turn of the eighteenth century. It is the idea of
'universal monarchy,' the attempt by Louis XIV and the Bourbons
generally to bully everyone else, and succeed to the vanishing hegemony
of the Habsburgs.
Thus Steven Pincus's piece labours an argument, to the point of
becoming wearisome, that we have all been foolish to imagine that the
Glorious Revolution of 1688 concerned anything so trivial as religion.
No, it was really about foiling the French, and no other view will
unlock its secrets. Doubtless people did fight about universal monarchy,
as they fought about a great many things. Life just happens to be
complicated, and only academics could imagine that it is all to be
explained by a concept.
But once the book has got this off its chest, it offers some splendid
stuff. The very title is pregnant with significance. A Union for Empire
might be thought to refer to the fact that 1707 helped to make the
imperial expansion of the new United Kingdom possible, and would
retrospectively justify to Scots the sacrifice of their independence.
But here it does not really mean that. It refers rather to England's
view of her status as an empire in an older sense, that is to say, a
realm entire of itself, in no way subject to any foreign potentate,
neither to a Holy Roman Emperor nor, above all, to a Pope of Rome. Some
Englishmen held that this empire also included Scotland and Ireland. The
claim was essentially spurious, but of historical importance simply
because it had been made.
The fount of sovereignty in this empire was the Crown, interpreted
from 1688 as the Crown-in-Parliament. When Scots inquired about a Union,
they found the English adamant against diluting the sovereignty thus
defined, for example, in some federal arrangement.
It is here that the European context becomes illuminating. Through the
seventeenth century, the English had been fighting nations more powerful
than themselves. Insecurity, as much as anything else, prompted them to
a rigid and even desperate insistence on an imperial sovereignty of
their own. Rather than dilute it they were, as J G A Pocock stresses,
quite prepared to do without a Union. The Scots therefore had to take or
leave that sovereignty. In the end they took it.
Meanwhile Scottish sovereignty, as set out in a superb essay by John
Robertson, had turned ''elusive.'' The sovereignty was plainly shared,
in the common Crown with England. But it had been shared in an
unsatisfactory fashion, becoming more unsatisfactory as time went on and
the sovereignty of the Crown evolved.
Somehow the whole arrangement had to be reconstructed. All the
available choices were difficult, and to an extent unpalatable. When
each was weighed up, a process admittedly distorted under the pressure
of events, the incorporating Union -- which the English alone were ready
to consider -- was found, let us say, no less easy than any other. It
also had in its favour the free trade which they were quick to offer.
Though Robertson makes nothing of it, bribery may have smoothed the
acceptance, but on his interpretation it cannot have been decisive.
The Scots did also get a guarantee for their institutions. On the
other hand, they had to take on the defensive English definition of
empire, the sovereignty of Crown-in-Parliament in a unitary state. There
was an obvious ambiguity in the deal, which remains with us to this day.
But every possible outcome would have had its ambiguities.
In bringing this out with such finesse, Robertson makes a major
contribution to our understanding of the Union. There was, in other
words, no straight conflict between a valiantly independent Scotland and
an English imperialism by turns menacing and fraudulent.
This is only the finest contribution to a volume full of riches.
Mention must also be made of David Armitage on Darien, of Roger Emerson
and Colin Kidd on the cultural background to the Union, and of Lawrence
Dickey and Katherine Penovich on that intriguing intellectual rascal,
Daniel Defoe.
Historical achievement of such an order will have a bearing on present
debates; but perhaps the main point to emerge is that there was no
outrage 300 years ago, outrage of the kind which it is incumbent on
modern Scots to require.

Washington, Sunday,
PRESIDENT Clinton has bowed to the advice of all his advisers and
ordered Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House closed to
traffic. It is a triumph for the Oklahoma City bombers and all the other
kooks in America, and a disaster for the rest of the country, especially
those who drive in central Washington.
Presidents have been progressively hidden away from the people who
elect them, in the name of security, and the worst of it is that the
precautions are usually justifiable.
The most recent attacks on the White House would not have been
prevented by closing Pennsylvania Avenue to traffic. One man flew a
small plane into it and another opened fire with an automatic rifle.
However a two-ton fertiliser bomb in a truck outside would severely
damage the building, and other buildings in the neighbourhood and would
also kill a great number of tourists.
Downing Street was closed to pedestrians because of the IRA, but
motorists may still drive in front of Buckingham Palace. Now American
presidents are finally wrapped into the same sort of protective cocoon
that enshrouds Latin American or Middle Eastern potentates.
The move has been approved by all shades of political opinion, but all
concede that it is a setback to democracy. Forty years ago, President
Truman would take a morning walk through the streets of Washington.
The imperial presidency developed later, the fruit of individual
megalomania and repeated attacks. If Mr Clinton goes jogging nowadays,
the fact is no longer reported.
As the president remarked in a broadcast announcing the closure
yesterday, four presidents have been assassinated and there have been
eight serious failed attempts, the most recent on President Ronald
Reagan in 1981.
That was outside the Hilton hotel, and a special covered entrance for
presidents was immediately constructed there, to keep all subsequent
presidents out of the direct view of gunmen -- and all other citizens.
The consequences of closing Pennsylvania Avenue will be horrendous. It
is one of the main east-west arteries in the city. Out-of-town visitors
loved to drive slowly past, noting the elegant and relatively modest
house of the president, the only really first-rate building in
Washington.
Not only Pennsylvania Avenue, but several other streets in the
vicinity have been closed, and cars, taxis, and buses must find
alternative routes around the new obstruction.
The streets immediately around the Capitol have been closed since a
scare in the early 1980s that Libyan hit squads were planning attacks on
American targets. Now we need protection against genuine, home-grown
terrorists, instead of imagined foreign ones.
The trouble is that although White House and Congress may be
protected, there are scores or hundreds of other government buildings
the bombers might select. Cars, lorries, and removal vans may still
drive past the president's office next to the White House, for instance,
or past the Treasury on the other side.
No-one would have thought the federal building in Oklahoma City in any
danger, so what about the FBI or the Bureau of Firearms? There is no
absolute security from terrorists. The president and a few tourists may
be safer, in theory, but nobody else is.

* THE FBI is close to arresting ''a group of major players'' in the
Oklahoma City bombing within the next several weeks, Newsweek reported.
''This thing involves husbands and wives as well as children as young
as 12,'' an FBI source told the magazine.
The source added that ''we pretty much know who is involved right
now'' in the April 19 blast which devastated the federal building in
Oklahoma City and killed 166 people.
The magazine said federal agents were looking closely at a white
supremacist group headed by Robert Millar of Elohim City, Oklahoma, a
family that denies any connection to the bombing or to supect Timothy
McVeigh.
The Millar family heads a group of about 75 people who live on a
400-acre community near the Oklahoma-Arkansas border, a settlement in
existence for 22 years. The group has been under investigative scrutiny
since the bombing.
Millar, a 70-year-old Canadian-born former Mennonite, is known as
''Grandpa'' to his followers and preaches a brand of fundamentalism
known as Christian Identity.
The family has had several encounters with federal agents over the
years and law enforcement officials say the community is heavily armed.
The source told the magazine that some of the ''major players''
already targeted by the FBI were talking to investigators in order to
seek lighter sentences.
However ''everyone involved is going to be arrested and charged'' and
''no-one is going free because he or she talks,'' said the source.

Kuala Lumpur, Sunday
A YOUNG British traveller was today in a Malaysian hospital suffering
from amnesia after being found unconscious at a railway station wearing
only his underclothes.
Mark Harris, 21, an engineer from Calne, Wiltshire, was discovered at
the Kuala Lumpur station on May 12, said his father Paul, who arrived in
the country last week after being contacted by the British High
Commission.
Commission officials found the address of his father on a piece of
paper Mr Harris son was carrying.
It was not known what had happened to his belongings.
He had left his home in Calne in mid-November and had been travelling
through Nepal, India, Thailand, and Malaysia.
Paul Harris said he and his wife last heard from their son earlier
this month, when they received a postcard from him.
He had not been expected home until September.
Mr Harris, who gained a first-class degree in engineering surveying
from Reading University, has so far shown no sign of recognising his
father.

Sarajevo, Sunday
THE war-weary people of Sarajevo today welcomed barricades which went
up across the city overnight to protect them from Bosnian Serb snipers
-- but some said it was a sure sign of more war to come.
Himzo Cakal, 39, inspected a double row of blue freight containers
erected last night one block from the Bosnian presidency building.
''It seems to me we're going back to war or worse,'' he said.
''Everything depends on the international community. They've imposed
an arms embargo, so we can't defend the city properly. It's like we're
laboratory animals in some mad experiment.''
City workers fanned out through the city centre under cover of
darkness today to put up barricades and cloth screens to thwart Bosnian
Serb snipers, who fire from the surrounding hills.
Similar barricades were taken down last spring after UN assurances
that the Bosnian capital would be protected from Serb gunners.
As Sarajevo has slid back towards war in recent weeks, however, the UN
has found itself unwilling or unable to prevent deadly sniper and mortar
fire into the centre of the city.
At least 13 people have been killed and a further 63 wounded in the
past week alone.
City officials decided to put back the sniper barricades in the wake
of that fighting. The UN, which helped take the old barriers down,
refused to help restore them.
A huge blue cloth banner 20ft wide and 50ft high was stretched between
two buildings on Kulavica Street, near the National Bank building, to
block snipers' views of pedestrians on the city's main business street.
It drew surprised looks from passers-by accustomed to scurrying
through the danger zone.
''This sniper screen is an excellent idea because I pass this way
several times every day,'' said a 33-year-old man. ''Unfortunately I
still have to run across the bridge where they have a good view of
me.''--Reuter.

Brussels,
BELGIAN Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's fragile centre-left
coalition government appeared on course for another term last night
after the expected advances of right-wing extremists failed to
materialise.
The overtly racist Vlaams Blok, which campaigns for the repatriation
of coloured immigrants, made only minor gains although it performed
strongly in its power base in Antwerp. However opinion poll suggestions
that it could bring down the government appeared mistaken.
The socialists, under threat after a series of damaging scandals,
suffered less than expected and appeared likely to survive in the
coalition.
With more than half the votes counted, one analyst predicted on
television that Mr Dehaene's coalition would win a small majority in the
newly reduced lower chamber -- perhaps 81 of the 150 seats.
There were widespread complaints about an excessively complicated
voting system. Electors were faced with polling cards a yard square
which did not fit into ballot boxes.
Belgians must vote by law in General Elections, although penalties for
not doing so are small. Members of the country's royal family joined
electors at the polls and had to queue to record their choice. It seemed
many electors had responded to a hint in the campaign by King Albert not
to cast only protest votes for the far right.
The election was marked by a rising disillusionment with politicians
after a series of sensational revelations about corruption in government
circles, mainly involving the Socialist Party.
The so-called Agusta affair, with allegations of bribes being paid to
government officials for an Italian helicopter contract, has caused the
resignations of several Ministers and threatens the future of Mr Willy
Claes, the Belgian former Foreign Minister who is now secretary general
of Nato in Brussels.
Foreign Minister Frank Vandenbroucke resigned from the government in
March, one of four Socialist Ministers forced out because of the
scandal.
The General Election was the first since the country became more
strongly federated in 1993, when more power was granted to the French
and Flemish-speaking regions. Mr Dehaene's Dutch-speaking Christian
Democrat party was forecast to win 28 seats and its francophone
equivalent, 11. The Dutch-speaking Socialist Party would win 21 while
its francophone sister party was expected to win 20.
Many voters themselves appeared surprised at the outcome after Mr
Dehaene ran a campaign talking bluntly about a coming austerity
programme. He also supports a single currency for the EU which appears
to have gone down well with Belgians.

I ENJOYED a short cycle ride on May 14 with several hundred people who
would normally not have considered their capabilities sufficient to ride
the length of the street, and thought how appropriate such an event
would be to the promotion of the Fit for Life Initiative.
Indeed Dr Harry Burns was there, to flag the group away, and we had
his family riding the full distance, and many others who lead work in
the health and environment fields -- for example, UK2000 Scotland's
George Chalmers testing out an ancient but sound one-speed bike which he
was proposing to use for work.
Everyone stayed on in Bellahouston Park for picnics, and to let the
kids play with the Big Top's circus skills team or to try out the
variety of special bikes on the site.
It is sad, therefore, that the events of May 9, when the Glasgow
Cycling Campaign criticised the new cycle path opened on that day, have
resulted in such a void between the campaign group and Strathclyde
region, and the potential to capitalise on this event to spread the
message was lost. Yet there may be a way forward, where those who would
shy from the short walk or ride to work can be guided on a similar
journey for a day out with the family or friends.
Later this year there is an excellent event in Pollok Park, when
private cars will be banned. In the past two years, there has been a
cycling area where unusual bikes can be tried out and information
dispensed, last year we had a static training bike rigged to try your
strength by showing how fast a cycle can really move (47mph).
It must surely be possible to sign some suitable routes through the
minor roads of Pollokshields from local stations to the park entrances.
Could this perhaps be the opportunity for rapprochement between the
parties involved, and launch of a Fit for Life in south-west Glasgow?
If this is too soon the coming of September heralds another Open Doors
day when the only way to really see a lot is to walk or cycle around the
city centre. If this event continues to be so successful, we may see the
competitive element similar to the Edinburgh Fringe Show Marathon, and
the visits being navigated on a city-centre version of orienteering.
When I see the traffic outside taking 20 minutes to travel the
distance I walk in three, I know there is sense in thinking in twos for
feet or wheels to get around Glasgow.

Jerusalem, Sunday,
A SURPRISE meeting will take place tomorrow between Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in an evident bid
to calm tension over Israel's plans to confiscate land in Arab East
Jerusalem.
News of the meeting was confirmed by an Israeli Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
Earlier, the PLO said that peace talks with Israel would go on despite
a call by a leading Palestinian faction to suspend them over the land
seizure.
''The Palestinian decision is to pursue negotiations. The decision to
start talks was taken by the PLO's leadership institutions and halting
the talks will be a decision for them to take,'' said Nabil Abu Rdainah,
press adviser to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
Arafat's Fatah faction, the largest Palestinian movement supporting
the PLO-Israel accord, had earlier today urged halting the talks until
Israel rescinded its decision to confiscate the land.
''Israel assassinated the whole process by confiscating land in East
Jerusalem on the way to Judaising it,'' Fatah said in a leaflet
distributed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
It was the first time that Fatah had called for a suspension of peace
talks and the latest sign of growing Arab anger over the Israeli
decision to confiscate 131 acres of land for mostly Jewish housing and a
police station.
Fatah also criticised the United States for vetoing a UN Security
Council resolution condemning Israel.
PLO officials said the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip agreed
yesterday to pursue negotiations despite calls by some members to
suspend them.
An official said the PLO would demand, at an Arab mini-summit in
Morocco on Saturday, a halt to Arabs normalising their relations with
Israel until it rescinds the confiscation decision and progress was made
in talks on expanding Palestinian authority.
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said he hoped reason
would prevail at the mini-summit, the largest gathering of Arab leaders
in nearly five years. He warned them against sabotaging peace moves.
Faisal al-Husseini, a Fatah leader appointed by the PLO to overseee
Jerusalem affairs, warned of an uprising, or intifada, that would spread
to other Arab countries if Israel did not reverse its decision.
''Yes, there will be an intifada and I say the intifada will not be
only in Jerusalem, not only in the occupied lands, but in all of the
Middle East,'' he told Israel Radio.
Palestinians consider East Jerusalem, occupied in 1967 and later
annexed by Israel, the capital of their future state. Israel says the
whole city is its eternal capital.
Abu Rdainah said the PLO leadership would give Israel until July 1 to
reverse its decision on land seizure and come to terms on expanding
Palestinian authority beyond Jericho to the rest of the West Bank still
in Israeli hands.
''If that deadline is not met, the PLO leadership will call for
meetings of the Executive Committee and the Palestine Central Council,
the highest legal body, to review the feasibility of the peace
process,'' he said.
''There will be a meeting of the PLO's Executive Committee meeting in
Tunis on June 1 to discuss the issue of Jerusalem and the PLO-Israeli
talks,'' he added.--Reuter.

IT is scandalous that so many cuts are being made to well-patronised
ScotRail trains entirely because the Government is trying to change the
basis of accounting. Locomotives and coaches which ScotRail once owned
and had fully paid for are lying in sidings in Inverness and elsewhere
earning no revenue for their new owners who are demanding a king's
ransom for their use.
You highlighted many of the cutbacks in the new timetable and the
supplement of corrections which has already been issued (May 19). There
are more.
Glasgow is to lose its through service to Inverness at 13.55.
Passengers will have to leave half an hour earlier and change at Perth.
This is being done to ''save'' a unit and means the 15.00 Perth to
Edinburgh has been axed, thus severing its connection from Inverness.
The unit would have been better used to reinstate the 09.00 Inverness to
Glasgow returning as the 13.55.
In the far north a unit is being ''saved'' by routing Wick passengers
via Thurso and adding 40 minutes to their already long journey times.
I am writing this on May 19 after seeing 40 passengers left behind at
Perth by the 13.55. ScotRail was going to organise a bus for them!
The 158 unit was crowded with people, space for luggage was far from
adequate, the toilets cannot cope with full trains over such long
distances. Seats are crammed in, much to passenger discomfort, and
capacity has still been reduced because the Government reduced the
number of replacement units that could be built.
Rail travel should have a great future, and passengers want to use the
services. All the present cutbacks are quite unnecessary and will
seriously damage the Scottish economy, particularly the Highland tourist
trade, this summer.
ScotRail could still run all the threatened services -- if only the
Government would let it.

I WAS shocked to read that readers and scribes who support dyslexics
and others in certain standard grade examinations are to be withdrawn on
the pretext that good results from them might deceive potential
employers (May 15).
I have an 11-year-old dyslexic son who is about to start secondary
school. This is an anxious time for all children and their parents, but
the anxieties are compounded for a dyslexic child.
Part of the parents' role is confidence building. Dyslexia is a hidden
handicap which erodes self-esteem.
I am lucky to have had much encouragement and information from
learning support staff, and educational psychologists, who all have my
son's best interests at heart and are positive about his future.
He is by no means a write-off in their eyes or mine. My son has many
strengths and potentials. Yet the Scottish Examination Board seems
determined to thwart all of these.
For the past few years my son has been learning bypass skills and
becoming familiar with such aids as spellchecks, laptop computers and
tape recorders. We were assured he would also be able to dictate answers
to a scribe if necessary, in an exam setting.
All these seem encouraging steps. He is not, after all, stupid. He is
a bright boy. However he cannot spell -- and for this he is to be
punished.
These aids which he will come to rely on are to be withdrawn when he
needs them most.
As for the argument that results gained are deceiving the potential
employers, this is nonsense. Most dyslexics have overcome their
disability with tenacity and inventiveness -- qualities an employer
would value.
In a previous article, Geoff Cox, chairman of the Institute of
Management in Edinburgh, advised companies not to be put off by the fact
that someone was dsylexic: ''It is something that can be worked out
rather than being a block to someone's potential development.''
Perhaps someone could explain this to the Scottish Examination Board,
which is seeking to marginalise our children in one fell swoop.

BEYOND the detail of William Russell's review of Rob Roy (May 15)
there are some matters of wider relevance.
The review was unfair and unkind but the makers of the film will
doubtless take comfort from Oscar Wilde's dictum that ''all criticism is
a form of autobiography''.
However, a disservice was done to Scots cinema-goers. Anyone
interested in our moving-image culture might have reflected upon the
excitement -- and the rarity -- of a big-budget quality Scottish film
being accorded the gala treatment it received. It would at least have
been fairer to convey the audience's real enjoyment at the European
premiere held in Edinburgh on Sunday, May 14.
Certain detailed aspects of the review were misleading. The point of
the film is not, as Russell suggests, to discover ''what might make
Scots different from other races (sic).'' If this was to be the
intention of the film-makers, it is to be regretted that Mr Russell
neglected to notify them ahead of time.
In fact, the film focuses on a particular story which explores the
hero's interpretation of ''honour''. To have missed this point is to
misunderstand the entire film.
A reviewer's task is, I suppose, to second-guess the film makers' but
Russell creates a new standard in this form of expertise by telling us
how he would have amended scenes. The review also contains
contradictions. How can the directing be ''leaden'' yet also
''superficially slick''? And to compare Jessica Lange's lovemaking in
The Postman Always Rings Twice with her appalling and violent rape in
Rob Roy is at best insensitive.
One opinion about a film is not of central significance. All film
makers are subject to the views of all audiences and, on the whole,
welcome this for good or ill.
I feel, however, that when Scots manage to make a major film, destined
for success in markets throughout the world, this single fact demands
recognition irrespective of personal opinion.
As so often it takes a non-Scot to recognise the virtues of our work.
The eminent film reviewer, Alexander Walker, writes on May 18 in a
London paper about Rob Roy: ''It's one of the great virtues of a movie
which applies the laws of period realism to its story, and thus shakes
the dust of ages out of Scott's pages, that so much about society . . .
as well as so many hints about the redcoat triumphalism of England's
military might, is conveyed in well-motivated brilliantly choreographed
action.'' He goes to commend ''a screenplay of distinction'' and a
''director (who) knows how to make you gasp . . . ''
To move on, however, to wider issues: the kind of negativity in
Russell's review is unhelpful to the work invested by many people in
trying to establish some viable Scottish film industry.
The Scottish Film Production Fund, which I chair and which was
instrumental in developing the film, is proud to be associated with Rob
Roy. It has proved a substantial success in the USA, where it was warmly
acclaimed by critics and public alike. Audiences enjoy the film,
embracing it on the terms on which it offers itself, rather than an
imposed set of criteria.
Scotland has seen too little film activity for too many years.
Recently we have managed to bring a small cascade of production, some
inspired locally and some encouraged from without, to raise Scotland's
profile throughout the world.
There is no doubting the real benefits which will accrue to our
tourist industry as a direct result of films like Rob Roy. But tourism
is only an indirect benefit; Rob Roy is by no means the first film to
have directly injected millions of pounds into Scotland's economy this
past year.
The renaissance of film making which we are witnessing here is, of
course, more important than the nay-saying which seems to accompany
effort and accomplishment.
But I hope that readers will recognise, through the miasma of even the
most hostile review, that projects like Shallow Grave and Rob Roy -- or
the forthcoming films Easterhouse and Trainspotting -- carry more than
just the weight of critical opinion upon their shoulders. They carry
national identity, cultural pride, and some of our hopes for the future
of film making in Scotland.

ROB ROY might have been present in spirit during the 1745 Rising but
as he died on December 28, 1734, he certainly did not fight in it on
either side (May 15).
I hope the film storyline is more accurate than what is obviously a
press release.

IN answer to the assertions made by Gerry McSherry that educational
integration is the solution to Scotland's enduring sectarianism (May
12), I would ask if non-denominational education is such an effective
unifying social measure why has it failed to bring about harmony between
the different racial and religious groups which presently partake of its
alleged benefits?
Notorious flashpoints such as the unsavoury episodes that occurred in
Shawlands Academy spring to mind as do the various instances of Muslim
children being sent home for placing the dress code of Islam before the
dress code of their schools.
I would even go as far as to claim that the majority of racially
motivated incidents that occur throughout the UK involve offenders who
are the products of a non-denominational education.
Why is this? The answer is obvious. A secular school is merely a
microcosm of the secular society, fraught with all of the injustices and
prejudices of the parent community, and until the ruling elite actually
take the trouble to address social disharmony in all its forms then the
proletariat will continue to be as intolerant and as ''bitter'' as they
are.
This country has a Race Relations Act yet no anti-religious
discriminatory legislation despite our contemporary past, and until such
measures are implemented then Scotland's old problem will not go away.
To blame the Roman Catholic community in Scotland (even in part) for
the sectarianism of Scotland is tantamount to blaming the victim for the
acts of the offender.

BRITISH climber Alison Hargreaves, who nine days ago became the first
woman to climb Mount Everest solo and without oxygen or the aid of
sherpas, has had a setback in her plans to climb K2 next month.
Her husband Jim Ballard said yesterday from their home at Spean Bridge
that she was forced to abandon most of her custom-made equipment and
clothing after a landslide blocked a Himalayan pass as she headed by
jeep from Tibet to Nepal. He added that although expedition organisers
hoped to recover the kit, the mishap could disrupt her plans to climb
the second-highest Himalayan peak.

Gillian Taylforth last year lost a libel action which cost her almost
half a million pounds. She failed to prove that her reputation had been
sullied by reports in The Sun newspaper that she had been found by a
local policeman performing oral sex on her then fiance, Geoff Knight.
The court case received unrivalled media attention. Her book, published
last week by Bloomsbury, called Kathy and Me explains her side of the
story. Never has a case involving a soap-opera star and an incident of
so little note been the subject of so much speculation. Anvar Khan spoke
to the actress who plays Kathy Beale in EastEnders, about the affair
I wasn't outraged that people thought I might be committing oral sex,
I'm not such a prude
THE prosecution's case relied very much on proving whether Gillian
Taylforth was capable of performing a sexual act. The only way to prove
that someone might engage in sex is to prove that they are sexual. To do
this, a video was procured from a ''friend'' who had recorded a private
party at which Taylforth made lewd, drunken comments. As she says
herself: ''I've seen worse at an Anne Summers party.''
This scene, then, was proof of the fact, that Taylforth could possibly
have been getting passionate with Knight in the car. The prosecution's
tack was significant.
Taylforth wanted to take on the press in court, and sue for defamation
of character. The case was intended as a battle between Taylforth,
Knight and The Sun. It was The Sun which Gillian Taylforth took to
court, and The Sun which consequently brought in the police to back up
their story.
''We didn't go for a criminal action against the police, we went for
The Sun, saying that what they'd printed was untrue and therefore my
reputation had been sullied. But The Sun had the police on their side.
''When we decided that we wanted to pull out after a while, not
because they brought in the police but because it was getting too
expensive, our advice was that if we did pull out, we'd probably have to
pay the other side's legal fees anyway.''
The difference with the court case and Eastenders is, that the court
case was big on theatrics and low in content.
''The video probably lost us the case. They saw this woman mucking
about at a party, and decided that my reputation hadn't been sullied
because basically I didn't have a reputation to lose. It's very rare
that a woman wins a libel action, a man will always win. It's easier to
make a woman seem more seedy than she is.''
Taylforth goes on to explain that in libel actions a woman's sexuality
is on trial, but a man's never is. If she is deemed to be loose, then
she has no right to make a moral claim about anything else. Same
argument they use to stop prostitutes prosecuting for rape.
The motivation for her pursuit of the trial in the first place is more
complicated. In her book she alleges she was sexually harassed by actor
Peter Dean, who played her husband Pete in the soap. Her producers, when
she reported it, did nothing. Neither did the cast.
''I'd go up and see Julia Smith and say, 'This is what's happening'. I
didn't get any feedback. The cast knew what was going on. I should have
said more to him (Dean) at the time, but I let it go. I'm not strong
enough to do those things. Once I confronted him and it was laughed off,
it was 'Oh, don't be stupid'. The trouble with sexual harassment is that
you have to be able to prove it. If there was a scene where he had to
kiss me, he'd kiss me properly. I'd go home, tell my mum and dad and
start crying.''
The ability, at 35 years of age, to go home and cry because someone is
exploiting you, could indicate a certain immaturity. But Taylforth
seems, in person, to be very alive and responsible. She has a
hyper-nervousness. Her nicknames include ''Spewy Huey'' and ''Leaky
Lou'' because she's always running off to relieve herself of some bodily
fluid when she gets emotional. When Taylforth was confronted with sexual
harassment, she did nothing. But when she was confronted with a
comparison on a larger scale, the allegation of gross public indecency,
she took it to court.
''My reputation matters a lot to me, Taylforth is my father's name.
Nothing that had happened to me before was worthwhile. When people come
out of the woodwork for a cheque and say, 'Oh, well, I had an affair
with her', I'm not interested. I wasn't outraged that people thought I
might be committing oral sex, I'm not such a prude. My outrage was that
I wasn't doing it. I mean, if I hadn't made a stand, what next, me and
the Arsenal football team?''
The passion behind her action was based on the sexual propriety with
which she was reared. Her father was willing to batter any man who dared
interfere with his daughters (he had four of them). The girls had to be
fully dressed in the house. If his standards hadn't been so high,
Taylforth wouldn't have been so insulted.
''I always wanted to be Dad's little girl. That's why I stayed at home
for all the time I did. (Taylforth left when she was 27.) I wanted to
stay in that sheltered life where my mum and dad looked after me. I
think at the end of the day we all want somebody like our dads, and men
want somebody like their mothers. If you had a great relationship with
your dad, you are seeking to be that little girl again. Both men, Geoff
and my father were very protective of their women.''
Geoff Knight, from whom she is separated, however, was
over-protective.
''I have my independence, Geoff could never quite understand that.
That's what all the publicised rows were about, one rule for him and
another rule for me. Very chauvinistic. If I said to him, 'I'm going out
with the girls and I might be staying over', he'd say, 'What do you mean
you're staying over?'.''
Taylforth now has little faith in British justice, she cites the cases
of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six. She ignores the instances of
women jailed for the murder of an abusive husband, which, given her
alleged victimisation by Knight, might have been the first to come to
mind.
''I've read from agony aunts that I've been a victim of abuse for more
than seven years. There was just the one time with the nose. It wasn't a
punch. I was yanked out of bed and fell down. Yes, it was his fault, and
he will have to live with it.''
Knight is not merely a fiery man. He is a man who takes complete
offence, where other more mild-mannered men might hold their ground. He
believes that to give someone an inch is to let them take a mile. And
that to give other men a glance at his girlfriend, a word in her ear, is
an infringement of his ultimate authority.
For Taylforth to laugh and flirt is to collude with an enemy who might
think less of him for letting her do so. He belongs to a male world
where the protagonists believe that female self-expression can be
censored, and foolishly try to do so. But you can never tell a woman how
to behave, unless it is in the name of religion such as Islam.
Knight's insecurity was a vulnerability and a liability.
Taylforth admits the police took Knight, a man with a string of
criminal convictions including grievous bodily harm, to Borham station,
after accusing them of practising oral sex, because he got very annoyed.
He was drunk. A self-made businessman, he still put his name to paper
without understanding what he was signing.
''(At home) he was mumbling on about how he had to sign a condition.
When it came out months later at the solicitor's office, they said,
'Geoff, you did sign a caution.' To me, a caution sounds like a warning.
It isn't, it's admitting to the offence. He didn't realise what he was
signing. If we'd known about that, we wouldn't have gone ahead with the
case.''
* Kathy and Me, by Gillian Taylforth retails for #14.99.

ROBBIE DINWOODIE reports from the Perth and Kinross by-election
battlefront and provides a few insights into some of the candidates.
THE Nationalist camp in the Perth and Kinross by-election, having
showed signs of nerves last week at the height of Labour's high-profile
push, emerged from the weekend confident that their candidate is on
course for a comfortable victory on Thursday.
While Labour leader Tony Blair topped up the prospects of a winning
surge during his second visit to the constituency last week, it was
becoming clear that the momentum was slipping away amid apparent
organisational difficulties besetting their campaign.
A System 3 Poll for The Herald was carried out over the weekend and
today we will be better able to judge whether Labour or the
Conservatives have closed the gap on the SNP to propel the by-election
to a nail-biting finish.
The SNP's Scottish Cabinet was convened in Perth yesterday and members
leaving the meeting seemed relaxed that candidate Roseanna Cunningham
had seen off the threat of a late surge from rivals.
The gathering was to discuss budget policy and the economic
implications of independence - an area in which the party has come under
attack by Labour and the Tories.
''We believe Labour are a busted flush,'' said SNP leader Alex
Salmond. ''Tony Blair's high profile was crucial to their strategy of
creating a swing and the failure of that tactic will cause substantial
damage to his leadership and credibility.''
Labour appeared to have a smaller number of activists than expected on
the streets of Perth on Saturday and were certainly outnumbered by the
SNP, but they are continuing to send leading figures north.
Deputy leader John Prescott spoke in Kinross last night and will
support candidate Douglas Alexander at his news conference this morning.
Mr Prescott told last night's meeting that Tories were bitterly
divided and had run out of steam.
He said: ''They tell porkies, they tell untruths, let's face it they
tell lies, lies, lies about tax increases and VAT on fuel. They are no
longer trusted.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown returns to the constituency today and
Ms Glenda Jackson, MP, speaks in Perth tonight.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown will arrive this week to support
their candidate, Mrs Veronica Linklater, and the Tory campaign in the
final three days will make use of Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind,
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, and Employment Secretary Michael Portillo.
All sides were playing down yesterday the impact on the campaign of
the revelation that the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn has an illegitimate
child in Australia. News of the nine-year-old boy's existence is
understood to have come out because Sir Nicholas provided for him in his
will.
THEY came, they saw, they concurred. Forget Rob Roy and Braveheart.
The latest haggis western was premiered in Perth at the weekend --
Ewing Family Values, a violent saga of a family at war in which, in the
finest traditions of Tinsel Town, the producers managed to create a
happy ending.
In this case the heroines , Winnie Ewing and Roseanna Cunningham
kissed, cuddled and cavorted openly in public in a demonstration that
they had got on famously all along, and that it had all been a dreadful
business got up by the press.
Michael Forsyth said it earlier in the week. Madame Ecosse said it
again on Saturday. It had been nothing but media mischief-making. Quite
right, too. It says so here on my passport: occupation --
mischief-maker.
So a smidgin of scepticism was permissable when the great
reconciliation was stunted on Saturday.
The meeting of the candidate and the elder stateswoman who once forced
her temporarily out of the race, was the highpoint for a frenzied day of
activity by all the parties in the by-election hustings.
Back in the combat zone, or pedestrian precinct as it is more usually
known, the runes could be read. The small band of Tories had given away
their balloons and retreated to the laager, the press were retreating
into another kind of lager, the Liberal Democrats had retreated to their
rural hinterland and the two men combatants were slugging it out to a
standstill.
It would be a brave heart, a fool or a Tory candidate who would bet on
other than an SNP victory come Thursday.

J C WEIR seems to side-slip the issue on baptism by making reference
to ''a more informal form fo worship'' (May 18). I have to say in all
honesty that no inquiry I have had about baptism had anything to do with
the form of worship.
Today we have hymn books such as Songs of God's People, Mission
Praise, and Junior Praise which are used regularly or periodically in
many churches. Yet these do not stop people wanting to use the church on
a one-off basis.
Beside his phrase ''strict club rules of eligibility'' I would place
the New Testament concept of the Church as a body -- the body of Christ.
(1 Corinthians 12: 12-14; Ephesians 2: 21/22).
This means that while faith is personal and individual it also
involves us in a corporate relationship under God with our fellow
members.
In order to live the Christian life we need to belong to a Christian
fellowship just as the parts of our body need to remain joined to the
whole body.

INDIA comes at you like a tidal wave, a seething mass of humanity,
ground down too often to the lower levels of degradation yet coming up
with a smile on its face to stir the conscience of an affluent West.
My immediate destination last month was that coastal strip of Goa,
humble enough in its roadside shacks as you drive from the airport, yet
ready to cosset you in little pockets of paradise, with the Arabian Sea
lapping sandy beaches and the swaying fronds of the palm tree shading
you from a generous sun.
But you know that the unbroken luxury of Cidade de Goa will give only
a limited impression of India so you call your friendly local agent, who
glories in the name of Wringo (''The fourth Beatle'', he insists!), to
see what he can do about interrupting the idyll.
Soon you are being spirited a thousand miles northward to Delhi, a
capital of nine million people, where you begin to gain the flavour of
this extraordinary nation. Old Delhi has streets so narrow that no ray
of sunshine ever penetrates.
But if the colonising British did nothing else for India, they can at
least claim the splendour of the adjoining New Delhi, with the spacious
heart of a Hyde Park and the radial contours of Paris, complete with Arc
de Triomphe.
At Gandhi's memorial, on the spot where they cremated his body, I was
struck once more by the speed with which the events of the day, still
fresh in the memory, become established history.
Wasn't it only yesterday that the frail little figure, all loincloths
and fasting unto death, a thorn in the flesh of some, heroic visionary
to others, was battling for India's independence?
He gained that freedom in 1947 but was no sooner coping with internal
religious troubles than a Hindu assassin brought his days to an end in
January 1948. Now the pilgrims flock to his memorial; and from that
eternal flame I cast an eye around this teeming land and wondered how
long it takes, even with the incentive of home rule, to bring some order
to a nation of nearly one billion people.
Almost half a century later, amid the poverty and squalor, there is
still no compulsory education; people in desperate need of help queue
endlessly outside hospitals.
Close by Gandhi's memorial, limbless children vie with blind beggars
for the crumbs of your wallet. It doesn't ease the pain to know that
some of those children were maimed deliberately at birth to ensure a
future beggar in the family; or to know that their efforts are well
orchestrated -- and quite lucrative compared with the meagre wages of
the workers.
So you tackle the five-hour drive to Agra, city of the Taj Mahal, and
gain the fuller sense of what India is about, from shanty town to
harvest field, stately women bearing unthinkable loads on noble heads,
poor and primitive but proud -- a nation moving with ant-like purpose,
clinging precariously to overcrowded vehicles being driven with suicide
in mind. (They still manufacture -- and export -- the old Morris
Oxford!)
Through it all comes the smiling face, prompting much wonder that the
serenity and contentment of the human race seems to exist in such
inverse ratio to material wealth.
Running the gauntlet of beggars and lepers, you finally emerge from
the squalor and catch that first glimpse of the Taj Mahal, the memorial
erected 350 years ago by the emperor Shah Jahan for the wife who died
after her 14th reproduction in 17 years.
Initial disappointment soon turns to appreciation as you close in on
the sheer scale and craftsmanship of the place. Mind you, when the old
emperor was planning to squander the family shekels on a second
mausoleum, his son and daughter had him locked up in the nearby fort.
And quite right too.
Onwards to the Deserted City, dodging the depressing sight of tethered
bears sent dancing out on the roadway to solicit your patronage;
listening to a tour guide making much of a particularly eccentric queen
who had a passion for keeping pigeons.
He went on at such length that I was tempted, in a moment of mischief,
to ask if her last and most sluggish pigeon was, by any chance, ''a
Hindu''. Doubting his appreciation of a Scottish pun, however, I thought
better of it.
So it was back to Delhi and another 1000 miles south to Goa, which now
seemed like the very heart of civilisation by comparison. That visit to
the capital at least lets you into one of the guarded secrets of
athletics -- how to run faster than Linford Christie!
But all is eventually well and you lap up the sunshine of glorious Goa
before facing that round-the-clock flight to Britain via Bahrain. On the
last lap from Manchester to Glasgow, we struck an air current more
violent than I have ever known, throwing cups in the air and spilling
tea and coffee in all directions.
The stewardess was giving her calmly-scripted announcement about
fastening our seat belts because of turbulence when the plane took its
biggest lurch of all. With exquisite spontaneity, the dear girl blurted
out an unscheduled ''Bloody hell!'' and defused a most alarming moment.
We all laughed, nervously but heartily -- and knew we couldn't be far
from Glasgow.

THE School of Scottish Studies at Edinburgh University has suffered a
tragic loss with the untimely death of Dr Alan Bruford, the eminent
folklorist and Celtic scholar, who was a senior member of its staff.
Dr Bruford was born on May 10, 1937. He was the son of Professor
Walter Bruford, who was instrumental in the founding of the school in
the late 40s.
Dr Bruford joined it as research/archivist in January 1965, but from
the start he interpreted his duties -- greatly to the benefit of the
school's work -- in a much broader light than simple archiving.
He found waiting for him the vast treasure-house of Gaelic recordings
made by Dr Calum I Mclean -- younger brother of Sorley -- which needed
to be catalogued, and also the immense store of lowland Scots material
which had accumulated through the '50s, largely because of the work done
with the Aberdeenshire travelling folk, including Jeannie Robertson.
Thanks to the tape recorder, the speed of collecting work had vastly
outstripped the ability of the school's workers to get on top of the
material, but thanks to Dr Bruford's labours the archive was gradually
brought under control.
When the school's first teaching programme began in 1971 -- the course
was called Oral Literature and Popular Tradition -- it became evident
what a skilful communicator the school had in Dr Bruford; in subsequent
years a whole company of Scottish ethnology students can thank him for
invaluable help and guidance.
Despite the massive burden of work in the school, Dr Bruford was able,
over the years, to contribute a number of excellent articles on various
aspects of Celtic folklore to publications across the world.
Cu Chulainn -- An Ill-Made Hero? appeared in Text Und Zeittiese
(Tubingen 1993). In this he made a vigorous defence of his conviction
that the great Irish heroic saga Tin Bo Cuailnge (the cattle-raid of
Cooley) was orignally a written composition by a cleric, although one
with a wide knowledge of historical legends, pagan myths, and
wonder-tales. Here he was carrying forward some of the ideas he had
outlined in his Gaelic Folk-Tales and Mediaeval Romances (Dublin 1969).
In December 1994, Scottish Traditional Tales appeared, which Dr
Bruford edited in conjuction with Mr Donald Archie MacDonald.
It should be added that Dr Bruford did sterling work over the years in
editing the school's magazine Tocher. This has presented to the public a
wide selection of the treasures garnered by the school.
Dr Bruford also undertook much enterprising fieldwork, particularly in
Orkney.
He is survived by his wife, Morag, and his daughter, Elspeth.

LAWYERS are set to clash over controversial council factoring charges.
Private solicitors and legal officers with Dumbarton District Council
are moving closer to court action to end a row over the right to demand
fees from former tenants who have bought their homes.
And the outcome could have a knock-on effect on thousands of council
home-owners in Glasgow, East Kilbride, Clydebank, Falkirk, Hamilton,
Inverclyde and Cumnock and Doon District Councils.
Charges cover items ranging from lift and ventilation system
maintenance to emergency lighting, refuse chute cleaning, communal
washing equipment, television aerials and caretakers' wages.
Dumbarton district met an angry reaction soon after it introduced the
levy -- about #2.50 a week -- last year.
The case may hinge on an opinion from law expert Professor Kenneth
Reid, obtained by the Faculty of Solicitors of Dunbartonshire, which
disputes the council's right to act as factor.
Dumbarton district secretary Michael Watters asked to see the report
but the lawyers first asked for an agreement to pay half the cost of
obtaining it.
This brought angry reaction from councillors -- who accused the
lawyers of being ''blooming cheeky'' and told the officials not to pay
up.
Helensburgh lawyer John Steele, who is Dean of the Faculty, also
suggested that the council might agree to jointly fund a test case --
but this was rejected.
Some councillors believe this indicates a weakness in the lawyers'
case and Renton member Jim Bollan said: ''Let battle commence.''

LEADERS of 440,000 Unison members employed in the NHS, including
240,000 nurses, meet today to consider their next move, in the light of
landslide support for industrial action over pay.
Nurses, ancillary staff, administrative and clerical grades and
ambulance workers are expected to demonstrate overwhelming support for
the principle of industrial action in protest at the Government's
''miserly'' offer of 1% nationally and the prospect of locally
negotiated top-ups.
Unison's health group executive will then go into session to discuss
the timing of industrial action ballots, which are now looking almost
inevitable. A joint meeting is likely with the other NHS unions,
including the Royal College of Nursing, to discuss the possible
co-ordination of ballots.
The non-TUC RCN, which last week took a historic conference decision
to recommend ditching its traditional no-strike stance, has still to put
the proposed rule change to a membership ballot, requiring a two-thirds
majority, before it can hold its first ever industrial action ballot.
This could take more than a month and may well cause the other unions
to put their ballots on hold.
The Royal College of Midwives has already decided not to proceed with
its first industrial action ballot since it too dropped its no-strike
clause, ostensibly to allow negotiations this week with the NHS. The RCM
is expected to seek to co-ordinate its ballot with the other, if as
expected those talks get nowhere.
The talks offer came in a letter from the junior Health Minister,
Baroness Cumberledge, which was seized upon by the RCM as an excuse to
hold up its ballot. It stressed that what was on offer was exploratory
talks on how local bargaining might be adapted for the midwives' pay
structures.
Last night Unison's head of health, Mr Bob Abberley, said the
indications were that today would reveal a massive rejection of the
Government's ''appalling'' pay offer to NHS staff.
''Mrs Bottomley should realise that we are heading for a precipice and
that she is responsible for us being in this situation,'' he said,
adding that the Government's pretence that local NHS trusts were free to
negotiate independently had been blown out of the water by recent
instructions, particularly to Scottish trusts, to come up with offers.
Meanwhile, Unison's Scottish members were yesterday warned to
scrutinise the ''strings'' of any pay offer made by trust managers.
Senior regional officer Jim Devine said nearly every trust was seeking
changes to individual contracts, and staff should closely examine what
the implications would be.
He cited ''average'' changes to a nurse's holidays and extra duty and
unsocial payments, costing almost #500, while a 3% increase would be
worth only #360.

IT IS pointless to rail at Mrs Thatcher for saying or writing what she
believes, even though her latest interpretation of current and past
politics shows her to be out of touch with present realities and as
devoid as ever of loyalty to her party. In a sense it is her attitude to
the Tory Party which defines the present row over the second volume of
her autobiography. The Conservative Party has been the vehicle for
Thatcherism, and Mrs Thatcher's loyalties are to her own particular set
of principles and beliefs. Loyalty to the party is relevant only
inasmuch as the party reflects those beliefs; the moment that time or
circumstances (or even a more sensible grasp of politics) forces the
party to change is the moment that it forfeits, in her view, the right
to respect and, even more importantly, respectful silence. The apparent
absence of self-doubt was always seen as a defining quality of
Thatcherism. In reality this could not have been as absolute as it
appeared. Undoubtedly Mrs Thatcher knew moments of doubt, swithered over
what to do, and even made some of those famous U-turns. But her doubts
were almost always over what course of action to pursue; the principles
which underlay those actions were rarely in doubt.
Mr Major is not a Thatcherite; his grasp of the realities of modern
politics is too acute to allow him to swallow the necessary belief
system in its totality. This makes him a better Prime Minister than he
is popularly believed to be, although it does not mean that he is a good
Prime Minister. Undoubtedly he is an unlucky Prime Minister in that his
position as successor to Mrs Thatcher makes him open to the sort of
abuse which she has directed at him now. The core of her complaint lies
in his conduct of policy on Europe. Mrs Thatcher believes this to be
wrong-headed and has issued a radical agenda which she believes will set
matters right. This includes repatriating ''lost'' power to Westminster,
rejecting the Maastricht Treaty which Mr Major negotiated so
painstakingly, abandoning all moves to political union within the EU,
and declaring the independence of the pound from European entanglements.
Reviewing this list of recommended actions it is difficult to conceive
of anything which could be more dangerous for Britain. It is the
philosophy and the clarion call of a long-dead age, as is so much of the
current anti-European cant. Mrs Thatcher envisages Britain's relations
with Europe to be those of trade only. Yet Europe is our biggest trading
partner and the reality is that Europe is, and will be, more integrated
and if Britain is not a part of that we will lose out dreadfully. Mrs
Thatcher also chooses to forget that it was she who forced through the
Single European Act and presided over the pernicious boom-and-bust
policy from which we are still suffering.
None of this will be much comfort to Mr Major; knowing you are
half-right rarely is. He must go into the troublesome summer with bad
by-election results and with his opponents on the European issue
fortified and reinforced. Worse, he will have to set the ground for the
inter-governmental conference on the future of Europe in 1966 with the
knowledge that the dissidents inside his party will be even more
troublesome than before. As ever, though, Mrs Thatcher has overdone it.
Her strictures on domestic policy are deeply insulting, dangerous to the
social fabric of the nation, and bound to bring support to anyone who
opposes them. Unlike the Home Office, she stresses that crime is rising
but blames it on a wholly imaginary link between social security
spending and anti-social behaviour. The solution? Switch resources from
welfare spending to crime prevention and detection and add a little
Victorian relish in the shape of persecution for single mothers; all of
this, mind you, in the name of traditional Christian values. Mr Major
could take a peep at his Bible, where he will find the real thing. He
might also discover the comfort which he will most certainly need in
coming months.

IT IS unlikely that any of the eight parties contesting Belgium's
General Election yesterday could form a Government by itself; and some
time will have to pass before a successful partnership is formed. It
took about four weeks on the last occasion. Fears that the country would
this time move far to the right, and so reinforce its inherent tendency
to fall into separate Dutch and French-speaking states, have been
exaggerated. The Flemish separatist party -- the Dutch speakers -- did
fairly well in Antwerp with about one-quarter of the vote but that was
much the same as its performance at the last elections in 1991 and very
much less than some opinion polls were forecasting. Similarly in
Walloonia, the French-speaking south of the country, previous voting
habits were confirmed with the socialists hanging on to their
working-class support in the industrial belt in spite of high
unemployment (beginning to fall a little) and a shaky economy. The
socialists seem to have emerged more or less unscathed from a succession
of scandals involving ministers in corruption.
Parties threatening to break up the country are no new thing in
Belgium politics, though the balance of power has shifted from French
speakers to Flemish in the years since 1945. The separatists have,
however, been able to appeal to new forms of racism in their opposition
to the Turkish and Moroccan immigrants who have moved to Belgium in
search of work but now suffer disproportionately from unemployment.
Neither the Conservative nor Socialist parties were tempted to follow
suit and it must seem as if, as with the French elections,
anti-immigrant hostility has been contained, even if it remains too high
for comfort in both countries.
The real problems the country faces would hardly be affected by its
fragmentation. Its ambitious welfare programme and public spending have
landed Belgium with a huge public debt. It fails massively to meet the
Maastricht criteria on state borrowing, for example, even though
successive Belgian governments have been desperate to move ahead with
financial and political integration. Belgium strongly supports European
monetary union but presents the classic profile of an economy which
would be severely damaged by its imposition. Whoever forms its new
administration will be hard put to bring its finances into the sort of
balance which would allow it to join the hard currency core of Germany,
Holland, and Austria. Even France would find it hard to meet the
requirements that core demands -- but could make a far more convincing
attempt. Unless the Germans made a political decision to carry the
Belgians economically, it is hard to see any Government achieving
quickly the sort of growth and spending cuts which would match its
visionary political ambitions to the economy's actual performance. The
effort to do so would be extremely unpopular, unless a programme
stretching into the next century were adopted. Such a timetable makes
nonsense of the earlier dates for implementing monetary union, but
anything else might simply work to the benefit of the extremes.

The Freemasons' influence within the Establishment could be the next
subject of the Nolan Committee's examination of public probity. Anne
Johnstone reports
LORD Nolan has a little list. A few days ago he gave us a glimpse of
it and freemasonry was fairly near the top. A charitable organisation
characterised by odd handshakes and harmless mumbo-jumbo or a sinister
unaccountable cabal influencing key decisions and spreading corruption
in public life? That's what his committee will be asked to decide.
It won't be easy. Others have tried and failed and even scholarly
independent research into the Brotherhood has ended by straddling the
fence. Considering the size of the movement (there are an estimated
700,000 Freemasons in Britain and around 125,000 in Scotland), it
attracts extraordinarily little publicity.
This is partly a deliberate policy, for despite a few tentative forays
into the limelight in recent years, freemasonry remains a largely taboo
subject. While some masons openly declare themselves, others avoid
replying when asked. All are bound by strict confidentiality rules about
some of the movement's activities and rituals. Masons, taunted by the
label ''secret society'', maintain their discretion is merely a desire
for privacy.
Of course, not everyone can become a mason. You must be male. And
because the Vatican officially forbids its adherents from joining, the
vast majority of British masons are Protestant. This is particularly so
in the West of Scotland where around 100 years ago the Brotherhood
became the focus of opposition to the influx of Irish immigrants. As a
result there is still a considerable overlap in some areas between the
activities of the masons and the Orange Order.
The origins of Freemasonry in Scotland are in the late
sixteenth-century, according to David Stevenson of St Andrews
University, author of a definitive account of its early history. The
strange rituals and superstitions of masonry, with their sinister
overtones of necromancy spring not from the Age of Enlightenment as
generally assumed but from the Renaissance, says Stevenson.
As stark Calvinism gripped Scotland in the seventeenth century, it not
only provided men with convivial company but also satisfied nostalgia
for the rich religious rituals of the past, he says.
Today support for Freemasonry is static in some parts of Scotland and
declining in others, according to Scotland's most senior Freemason, the
Earl of Elgin, a past Grand Master. He says around 5000 a year are
initiated, compared with around 14,000 annually in the years after after
the Second World War.
It used to be difficult to obtain such figures officially. The
movement appeared to be dogged by an almost obsessive secrecy. But all
that was changed in 1983 with the publication of Stephen Knight's book
The Brotherhood, an investigation into the influence of Freemasonry on
our police force, the judiciary and many other areas of public life.
After Knight's death the torch was picked up by Martin Short whose
sequel, Inside the Brotherhood, appeared in 1989. Concerned that this
sort of exposure was damaging them, Freemasons took a tentative step out
of the closet in order to allay public concern about their rituals and
promote the philanthropic side of their activities.
In 1992 the press received an unprecedented invitation to attend the
organisation's 275th anniversary celebrations and in 1994 the
Brotherhood launched its first advertising campaign.
This week Lord Elgin happily answered my questions about Freemasonry
in Scotland. He was keen to emphasise the clubiness and good-works side
of the movement, which he described as ''primarily a social network''.
Could this social network be used to promote the mutual advancement of
its members, to the exclusion of non-masons? ''Inevitably there are
instances where this happens in an organisation as large as ours. A bad
mason would be someone who used his influence and was found to be doing
so.''
He added: ''A Freemason is encouraged to be as good a citizen as he
can. Certain characteristics are encouraged. Any member who fell
seriously short of what was expected would be asked by his lodge to
leave,'' he said.
Freemasonry also benefited society at large -- he said: ''You'll find
Freemasons have extraordinary lists of charitable things they do. For
instance, recently masons in St Andrews donated #2500 to local
organisations.''
Critics of the movement say despite the great deal of charitable work
carried out by masons, the overall influence of the movement is to
corrupt public life, especially in the areas of awarding contracts and
promotion within the middle managements of both large private companies
and public organisations.
This is very difficult to assess. The whole subject is rich in
anecdote but short on systematic investigation. For example, a colleague
recounted how her husband had left a large West of Scotland-based
engineering firm ''because he realised he wouldn't get further promotion
unless he joined the Brotherhood and he didn't want to.''
An architect friend told ruefully how he had lost public contracts to
competitors who were masons because the contracts were decided by
officials who also happened to be masons. He went so far as to say that
architects in the Brotherhood placed a small motif in the top left-hand
corner of their drawings to indicate their allegiance.
Glasgow City Chambers is sometimes known informally as the Vatican. By
contrast at Rhuddan Burgh Council in North Wales, a request by the town
clerk (himself a mason) that councillors and officials in the
Brotherhood withdraw from consideration of an application to extend the
local masonic hall resulted in every man except one leaving the room.
Will Nolan be able to sift fact from myth? The areas he is most likely
to look at are local and national government, the civil service, the
judiciary and the police force.

A RETIRED headmaster with eccentric tastes is itching to get his hands
on fleas.
Mr Bob George, from Bournemouth, is urging Scots to start scratching
around for specimens for his collection.
It is 21 years since he compiled the first comprehensive study of
Britain's flea population and he has been asked by the Biological
Records Centre to update the Fleas of Great Britain Atlas, and Mr George
intends to put Scotland firmly on the map.
The 74-year-old admits to having an obsession with the subject going
back 45 years and concedes that few share his passion.
So far he's recorded 60 different types around the UK but says records
show Scotland as a virtual flea-free state compared to other parts of
the UK.
''The cat flea, which is widespread elsewhere, has only been recorded
in 19 locations in Scotland so far, mainly in the big centres such as
Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh.''
His biggest flea mystery occurred in Scotland several years back when
he was sent one of the insects which had been found on the coat on a
badger killed by a car in Kincardineshire.
''It was the only flea of its kind ever recorded in the UK and is more
commonly found in central Europe and France in particular.
''How it ever came to be in Scotland is quite baffling,'' he said.
He is hoping people will send him old birds' and rodent nests,
complete with recorded details of where and when found to help him build
a better picture of flea distribution north of the Border.
He added: ''It is quite all right to remove old nests once the birds
have flown and they have been vacated. Old voles' nests, which are often
to be found under sheets of corrugated iron, also offer good material
for me.
''I would be delighted to receive samples from any type of host. They
should be wrapped up in a polythene bag, labelled with all the relevant
information and posted to me.''
His study will take place during National Flea Awareness Week,
commencing July 17.
All samples should be sent to 54 Richmond Park Avenue, Bournemouth BH8
9DR.

<TEXT>
RESIDENTS of a Berwickshire village have begun a desperate race
against time to buy #200,000 worth of forest to keep it out of the hands
of private buyers who, they fear, may restrict public access.
For decades walkers, horse-riders, runners, and nature lovers from
Westruther (population 200) have had free access to the glades and
pathways of 450-acre Spottiswoode Forest.
But now, following Agriculture Minister Sir Hector Monro's go-ahead
for the disposal of woodlands all over Scotland, the Forestry Commission
has put Spottiswoode on the market.
The sale is being handled by Edinburgh agents Cleggs, who say they
have already had inquiries from timber merchants and commercial woodland
investors.
Tonight the Westruther community council meets in emergency session to
work out a plan of campaign to thwart any takeover. The session follows
a packed public meeting in the village hall at the end of last week
which decided to try and buy the woods and preserve them for the
community.
It is a daunting task for a small village but local regional
councillor Jimmy Nairn, who chaired the public meeting, said yesterday:
''It would be a tragedy if we lost our free access to Spottiswoode.
''The forest is full of wildlife and has been giving pleasure to
people for decades, not just from Westruther but from a much wider area.
I know of one woman from Duns who has been bringing her mother here for
years because the old lady loves the peace and beauty.
''It is a delightful area. There is also a residential outdoor centre
nearby that is used each year by 1500 schoolchildren from Strathclyde
and the Lothians as well as the Borders.
''I reckon we have until the end of June to get our act together and
have a chance of beating any private buyers. It is not long for an
enterprise of this size but there is a lot of support.''
Central to the hopes of the villagers is help that could be on hand
from the Woodland Trust, which runs 63 sites in Scotland ranging from
1700 acres at Spinningdale in Sutherland to one wood of less than an
acre in Fife.
Listening sympathetically at last week's public meeting was Mr Andrew
Bachell, Scottish director of the trust. He said yesterday: ''If the
village can get the ball rolling with about #10,000 to show that they
are serious we would consider moving in to buy and manage the forest.
''The trust specialises in running woodlands to maintain public access
and enjoyment. We manage the wildlife conservation and landscaping and
although we harvest where necessary we do not operate commercially. We
are a charity dedicated to preserving informal recreation in the
countryside.
''In this case the time scale is very short but it is not an
impossible objective. If enough support is mobilised we can go to
grant-aided bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage. There is also the
Lottery Fund and the Millennium Forest for Scotland Fund. The public
response seems excellent and at the end of the day we would not let a
good plan fail.''
MrGiles Dearden, Forestry Commission area land agent, also attended
the village meeting. He said: ''If the community was able to raise the
money they would be considered in exactly the same way as any other
buyer. There are a number of legal rights of way through the forest,
including one bridle path for riders, and these are protected. Any wider
access would be at the discretion of the purchaser.''
The forest is a particular boon to riders in an area where heavy
traffic on the narrow roads can be a menace to nervous horses.
MsAlison Isles of Westertoun Riding School, Westruther, says: ''There
are lots of tracks in the forest. In fact we hardly use the one bridle
path that would be the only guaranteed right of way if a private buyer
took over. Spottiswoode is used by many riders every week and by even
more walkers, bird-watchers, and runners. There is a delightful two-acre
lake in the middle and there always seems to be something different to
see.''
Backing for the fight has also come from Roxburgh and Berwickshire MP
Archy Kirkwood, who claims the threat to Spottiswoode highlights the
access problems facing woodlands put up for sale by the Forestry
Commission all over Scotland.
He says: ''The Government must review its policy of forestry sale so
that areas like Spottiswoode are protected properly in future. It is a
pretty drastic position for a community to be in when they actually have
to set about trying to buy a local woodland to guarantee access. It
shows that the guidelines set up by the Government are not producing the
degree of protection they should.''

Chris Holme reports on the threat to the Government posed by the
nurses' dispute
THE Government may now be waking up to the possibility that it might
be the first in history to be destroyed by angels. Ministers have
handled the nurses' pay dispute with all the subtlety of a flying
mallet. In doing so they have transformed the Royal College of Nursing,
their closest traditional ally among health unions, into a seething army
of discontents.
There is now a breathing space before the RCN ballots its 300,000
members next month on changing Rule 12, its long-established rule
banning industrial action.
Some kind of compromise deal over the next few weeks is the likeliest
outcome. Otherwise, the stakes will rise to a point where neither the
college nor the Government can back down and there have already been
calls for radical and decisive action.
''It is time nurses stopped pussyfooting around,'' said Ann Martin,
former senior officer for the RCN in Scotland who now runs a
nurse-training consultancy in Edinburgh.
''Nurses and junior doctors should get together as they did in Belgium
in the 1960s and say at 11am we are all going to walk out for 24 hours.
If they gave 28 days' notice of this, the Government will crack, as it
did in Belgium, and given its unpopularity, the public would support
them.''
''I don't think they will succeed by selective action like not filling
in forms. If nurses want to achieve anything this time, they should get
hold of the biggest sword they can and chop this Government at the
knees.''
The key question for the current RCN leadership is how much of the
anger at the Harrogate congress is shared by the rank and file.
Antagonism at Government policy was fuelled by insults and plain
disinformation from Ministers about pay deals offered by trusts.
Junior Health Minister Lady Cumberlege, also a vice-president of the
RCN since 1989, caught some of the gentler flak as she was shouted down
with boos and cries of ''rubbish''.
She told the Lords local pay bargaining was the modern way forward to
replace the ''Jurassic Park'' of national agreements. By that she also
implied that all doctors are dinosaurs since the BMA has accepted a
national 2.5% award.
Ministers insisted that all trusts should be able to offer, and the
majority had actually offered 3%, when the reality was somewhat
different. As of yesterday the RCN had received only six unconditional
offers out of 46 trusts in Scotland. The remainder, according Scottish
RCN Secretary June Andrews, have enough strings to start a knitting
circle.
In trying to maintain a hands-off approach to the actual dispute, the
Government has been hoist on its own petard. Part of the reason for
setting up management executives and trusts was to distance Ministers
from the political damage of local failings in the NHS. Trust managers
and chief executives were left to hold the hot potato in the way the Pay
Review Body made its award.
There is undoubtedly, despite Government denials, a covert agenda at
least in the Treasury to attack nurses' conditions.
Plans for new hospitals in Glasgow, Birmingham, and Edinburgh were
framed with nursing savings in mind: in Edinburgh's case #5m a year from
cuts in night-time and unsocial shifts.
It would be remiss for accountants not to seek closer control of the
biggest single item in NHS spending, but there has been a string of
tactical blunders by Ministers.
In targeting nurses this year they have alienated the one group most
responsible for the increased efficiency of the NHS in treating more
patients.
NHS reforms have brought in 1200 additional managers and
administrators to Scottish trusts in the past three years, at an annual
cost of at least #16m. The RCN estimates the cost of negotiations at
every trust will be around #5m.
For the same #21m, the Scottish Office could have settled the entire
3% claim for virtually all Scottish nurses. It becomes hard for the
public to believe claims that the Government gives top priority to
patient care when it devotes such sums to bureaucracy at the expense of
the people who do the caring.
Ironically, the whole process of moving to new pay structures and
getting rid of cumbersome and outdated allowances was achieved by one
Scottish trust within days of it being established.
The Scottish Ambulance Service redistributed its budget offering 6% to
paramedics and 10% to control room staff. Unions and management left
equally satisfied.
Against this the position of the RCN and other unions is not without
its drawbacks. They all represent some staff either already signed up
for trust contracts or outwith the NHS and the scope of the dispute. In
addition, the Royal College of Midwives seems to have broken ranks from
the united front with its talks with the Government due to start
tomorrow.
The RCN congress vote in favour of dropping the no-strike clause could
scarcely have been more emphatic: 499 for and three against. Few doubt
that the majority of members will back it, but it requires a two-thirds
vote to effect the constitutional change and failure to achieve this
will seriously damage the leadership's credibility.
Ministers are now confident that the RCN cannot take action to cause
administrative chaos for trusts without affecting patient care. Probably
because they think all those wifies who run the RCN are still in
twin-sets and brogues.
Nothing could be further from the truth. RCN general secretary
Christine Hancock and June Andrews are former NHS managers, well
acquainted with the weak spots in NHS administration and how to exploit
them.
The original angel with the lamp was Florence Nightingale whose work
saved several ministerial skins. Her Crimean hospital is still
remembered in the name of the RCN's publishing wing, Scutari.
Just how much this meek image of holiness appeals to the present
generation of nurses is now for them to decide.

ROYALTY
* THERE has been a tradition of royal patronage of freemasonry. King
George VI was a keen member. The Duke of Edinburgh was initiated, but
has taken no active part. However, the Duke of Kent, initiated in 1964,
was made a Grand Master in 1967 at a glittering ceremony in the Albert
Hall to coincide with the official 250th anniversary of the movement.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
* FOR a number of years the Labour MP Chris Mullin has called for an
investigation into Freemasonry in public life. He told me: ''Masons tend
to congregate where influence is being disposed of. In Local Government,
you'll find them on planning committees and that sort of thing.''
Indeed, according to Stephen Knight, in many parts of Britain there
are Masonic Lodges inside local authorities to which both officials and
councillors belong.
In the West of Scotland where local politics is dominated by the
Labour Party and many councillors are Roman Catholics, masonic influence
in local politics is minimal.
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
* ACCORDING to Stephen Knight at any one time between 30 and 60 MPs
are Freemasons but he concluded there was ''no real discernible
influence by Freemasonry on Commons voting.''
He added: ''The majority of MPs who are masons -- witness Cecil
Parkinson . . . -- have no time to attend meetings,'' he says.
However, according to Chris Mullin, there is a lodge in the House of
Commons called the New Welcome Lodge. Its members are mainly but not
exclusively Tories. Knight says there is no evidence of cross-party
collusion by members of the Brotherhood. Incidentally there are also
thought to be separate lodges at Westminster for police officers,
attendants and the press gallery.
CIVIL SERVICE
* THIS is another area of public life where stories about the impact
of Freemasonry are rife. For example it is said that there is a lodge
consisting largely of Ministry of Defence procurement staff and arms
dealers. In The Brotherhood Knight says: ''Membership of the Brotherhood
can be an important factor in promotion, especially to the ranks of the
powerful Permanent Secretaries. In some ministries, Defence for example,
it can be a distinct disadvantage not to be a mason.''
The history of Freemasonry among the middle ranks of public servants
is a long one. Robert Burns, for example, joined the masons in the hope
of furthering his career in the customs service.
In a recent House of Commons motion, Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for
Cardiff West, claimed that Health Service administration in south and
mid-Glamorgan health authorities is virtually controlled by Freemasons.
''In the Health Service in my area, it isn't a question of masonic
influence but masonic domination. It's almost impossible to get beyond
middle management unless you have a funny handshake. Despite the
charitable work the masons do, their overall influence as a secret
society is like a cancer distorting the way taxpayers' money gets spent
and the way people climb the greasy pole.''
Chris Mullin says: ''The top people have their own networks. It is the
second-raters who are active in masonic lodges. Some just do it for the
social life but others join because they think they'll get something out
of it.''
He added: ''I don't think it can be right for some public servants to
be members of a secret society, one of the aims of which is mutual
self-advancement.''
THE JUDICIARY
* EVER since the Jack the Ripper murders of the 1880s there have been
accusations of cover-ups and conspiracies involving the judiciary and
the legal profession.
A former High Court judge and mason, interviewed by Knight for his
book, maintained that Freemasonry generally exerted an influence for
good among judges because ''Freemasonry teaches a man to love his fellow
men.''
However he admitted that he had known two occasions when Freemasonry
influenced a judge improperly. He said usually mason judges ignore any
words, phrases or motions used by masons to identify themselves as such.
There are many instances of witnesses and defendants using masonic
signs in court when the judge is a mason.In a recent court case
involving a Freemason, the judge admitted he too was a mason in his
opening remarks. Nobody disputes the facts. The question is whether the
exploitation of Freemasonry connections can change the outcome of a
case.
THE POLICE
IT is an open secret the Freemasons are particularly thick on the
ground in the police, especially in certain areas of the country. One of
those areas is Strathclyde.
The strength of Freemasonry in the police raises two moral issues.
First, does Freemasonry distort promotion prospects? Second, are there
cases when Freemasonry influences the course of an investigation (eg
when a mason suspected of a crime is investigated by an officer also in
the Brotherhood?).
Concern about the possible corrupting effect of Freemasonry on the
police goes right back to 1877 when it was revealed that most of the
detective department at Scotland Yard was being controlled by a gang of
swindlers. The scandal had begun with a meeting between a Yard
inspector, John Meiklejohn, and a criminal, William Kurr, at a lodge in
Islington.
As recently as last month Sir Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner, ordered the removal of Freemasons from the Yard's
anti-corruption squad after an investigation into the operation of the
Brotherhood among their ranks.
Ten years ago Stephen Knight reckoned that as many as 33 of the 50
chief constables in place at the time were masons. Nobody knows what
that figure might be today. However it is known that Strathcyde Chief
Constable Leslie Sharp is not a Mason.
When I attempted to contact the Chief Constable by telephone to
solicit his personal views on the subject, my call was diverted to the
force information office. Superintendent Louis Munn checked with me what
I wished to ask. The questions to Mr Sharp included whether he believed
active membership of a masonic lodge is compatible with being a serving
officer, and whether to his knowledge membership has ever affected
either the course of criminal investigations or promotion prospects.
A few minutes later Superintendent Munn phoned back to say after
consideration he would not be putting my questions to Mr Sharp and
instead issued the following statement:
''As far as Strathclyde Police is concerned, organisations that
members use in their private life is (sic) entirely a matter for them.
It doesn't became a matter for us until such times as it impinges on the
exercise of their duty. If that ever happened it would be treated by us
extremely seriously. As it stands at the moment, there's no evidence to
suggest that this is an issue in Strathclyde Police and we don't intend
to make it an issue.''

THE possibility of Trident nuclear submarines being refitted at Rosyth
dockyard rather than Plymouth Devonport was discounted yesterday by
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
He dismissed speculation that the need for improved safety standards
at Devonport could mean that Rosyth would obtain the #5500m Trident
refit contract, awarded to the English yard after lobbying by both
managements.
Interviewed on the BBC's Scottish Lobby programme, Mr Rifkind said the
decision stood. ''We are talking about when nuclear facilities will
cease at Rosyth not whether,'' he added.
The position was that the 12 nuclear-powered Hunter Killer submarines
would be refitted at both yards ''a little bit longer than was
originally expected''.

TOMORROW is deadline day in another Scottish railway row -- not over
line closures, but a new piece of track in Glasgow with stations ''in
the wrong places''.
Strathclyde region, with its passenger transport executive (SPTE), has
sent plans to Parliament of the CrossRail passenger line, which should
be operating within five years.
This will run along the east of the Merchant City, from High Street
south through Glasgow Cross, across the Clyde and Gorbals to
Pollokshields.
Travellers, transport and heritage groups, MPs, and the city council
are delighted, as it will improve links in the biggest urban rail
network outside London. But they object to Glasgow Cross station not
really being at Glasgow Cross but perched over a residential enclave
behind Saltmarket, and High Street station being moved east away from
passengers from the developing Merchant City and Strathclyde University.
Formal petitions to Westminster against the station sitings are being
lodged before tomorrow's parliamentary deadline. These come from traders
in the area, heritage organisations, community councils, city centre
residents who would be overhung by hefty platforms, and public transport
proponents.
Glasgow District Council has prepared its own petition, but
last-minute discussions between Labour leader Pat Lally, regional
transport chair Charles Gordon, and SPTE officials may mean changes
could be made to the station plans.
Councillor Lally has proposed that the ''magnificent setting'' of the
A-listed Mercat building at Glasgow Cross could be used as part of the
new station and a renovated retail centre.
The city owns the building, and is offering it virtually as a gift to
help regenerate the rundown eastern end of the city. It could also be
used for a future interchange with the east-to-west Argyle passenger
line.
''The offer of the Mercat building means we can look again at the
Glasgow Cross option,'' said Councillor Gordon. ''I feel very relaxed
about this and we have plenty of time to change details, despite the
deadline for objections.''
Although a repositioned station at the Cross would be very close to
the proposed new High Street station, Councillor Gordon believes there
would be too many problems shifting that station further west.
''It would be very costly to put the High Street platform underground
and disrupt rail travel for months,'' he said.

GREEN Party veteran Robin Harper had a skeleton dancing behind him as
he intoned the familiar lament of candidates who enter the field with no
expectation of getting a result.
The anguished plea: ''If only all those people who say they agree with
what we're saying would come out and vote for us.''
They never do, which is why fringe candidates remain just that. The
Scottish Green Party does make it on to our System 3 polls by breaking
the 1% barrier from time to time, but it has never made the kind of
dramatic breakthrough the party has achieved in Europe.
MrHarper, a 54-year-old modern studies teacher at Boroughmuir High
School in Edinburgh, had the skeleton as a visual metaphor for the
plight of the National Health Service.
Enthusiastic supporters of the Scottish Constitutional Convention's
plans for a parliament elected by proportional representation, and full
independence, if the people support this in a multi-choice referendum,
his party introduced a novel twist to the by-election by suggesting that
Perth might be the city to host it.
This tantalising offer is topped only by one from another of the
fringe candidates, the most seasoned by-election campaigner in Britain,
Lord David Sutch of the Official Monster Raving Looney Party. The main
plank of his campaign is an extension to the Channel Tunnel so that it
emerges in the heart of rural Perthshire.
Another candidate with the potential to become a cult figure is Mr
Vivian Thornton Linacre, flying the Union flag for the UK Independence
Party.
A splendid sight on the stump, he rides pillion on a motor cycle and
shouts his anti-Brussels message about the ''New German Empire'' through
a megaphone.
A 66-year-old property expert from Edinburgh, Mr Linacre is
wonderfully irascible and in full flow resembles One Foot in the Grave's
Victor Meldrew. His favourite word is absurd, which he pronounces with a
resounding Z-sound.
The Natural Law Party people are a somewhat more relaxed lot. We were
entirely free to leave their press conference at any time and most were
quick to exercise that right. Mr Gary Black, 26, from Glasgow studied
computing and mathematics and now teaches transcendental meditation when
not hillwalking, cycling, cooking, and reading.
Four volumes of Scientifically Validated Evidence, 3000 pages of the
stuff, were thumped down. Apparently, if enough people bounce up and
down on their bottoms on mattresses, crime, poverty, and disease will be
abolished and the Tay will never again burst its banks.
Eight years ago Dundee businessman Michael Anthony Halford had an
unfortunate spat with a woman friend who took a sharpened object to what
the tabloid press coyly refer to as his manhood. Worse, in spite of our
having some of the finest medical schools in the world, the microsurgeon
who reattached it supposedly did so upside-down and the operation had to
be redone.
Most people would keep quiet about this sort of thing, but Mr Halford,
who runs and owns Deacon Brodie's pub in Jute City, decided to stand as
the Scottish Conservatory and Unionist candidate and sold the saga of
his ordeal to the newspapers.
He is standing on the slogan ''Send an Honest Man to Parliament'', and
comes across exactly like the barman who likes a good argument with his
customers.

A LONE Scots sailor, dubbed Captain Catastrophe, has been rescued for
the eighth time. Mr Robert Turnbull set off from Bridlington Harbour,
Yorkshire, on Friday to continue his six-week journey from Hastings to
Dundee, but coastguards saw his yacht going round in circles close to
the Flamborough cliffs.
They ordered the lifeboat to launch and its crew found Mr Turnbull
seasick and suffering from cuts to his hands. He has been detained in
Bridlington and District Hospital where he is reported to be
comfortable. He has told coastguards he now wants to hire a lorry to
complete his voyage.

A REPORT which could help save an important part of Glasgow's
architectural heritage will be sent to the city council today.
It details the cost of restoring Lion Chambers in Hope Street, an
A-listed property which is one of the earliest examples in the UK of
reinforced concrete construction.
The 90-year-old building was declared dangerous earlier this year, and
its commercial owners have applied for permission to knock it down. They
believe that, without public help, repairs would be prohibitively
expensive.
However, conservationists argue that the eight-storey building's
innovative features make it worthy of retention and renovation.
Although the bill for restoration is likely to exceed #2m, demolition
of the chambers is widely seen as incompatible with Glasgow's title as
City of Architecture in 1999.
Senior council officials, including planning director Mr Mike Hayes,
are known to regard saving the building as a matter of priority.
Funding bodies, including Historic Scotland and the Glasgow
Development Agency, will be asked to support the renovation of the
chambers. One possibility being suggested is the formation of a trust to
buy and maintain the property.
Mrs Audrey Gardner, of the Strathclyde branch of the Architectural
Heritage Society of Scotland, yesterday described the building as ''a
vital part of Glasgow's past and future'' which helped attract many
visitors to the city.
''Every avenue, both technical, and financial, should be thoroughly
explored to find a way of preventing the demolition,'' she said.
The report being sent to the council has been prepared by the Glasgow
Buildings Preservation Trust, which has previously been successful in
putting together funding packages to save important buildings in the
city.
Its director, Ms Liz Davidson, declined to discuss the dossier's
contents before it was delivered to the council, but expressed cautious
optimism that a solution to the difficulties of Lion Chambers could be
found.
''Patch-up'' repairs to the building have been priced at about #1.5m.
However, such work -- extending the life of the property by only 20
years -- is not normally eligible for external grants.
It is understood that the Preservation Trust's report will advocate a
longer-term approach which, while more expensive, is more likely to
receive aid from funding bodies.
Mr Gavin Stamp, a lecturer at the Mackintosh School of Architecture
and a passionate supporter of the building's renovation, said yesterday
he believed that the report would suggest a full-scale renewal of its
exterior walls with modern replacements.
He justified the cost of the project by saying: ''Apart from being a
delightful old building, it's of immense importance in European
architectural terms.''
Lion Chambers was built in the first decade of this century, from a
design by local architect James Salmon, a friend of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh.
Because the vacant site in Hope Street was only 11 yards by 15 yards,
he dispensed with traditional masonry construction and maximised the
interior space by using the then novel technique of reinforced concrete,
andmost of its walls are only four inches thick.
Repairs were carried out in 1979, but were unable to stem the
property's serious structural problems. In March, it was cordoned off
after chunks of concrete fell on to Hope Street, and the building's
tenants were temporarily evacuated.
Chartered surveyors Speirs Gumley, the managing agents for the nine
owners, confirmed that they would be interested in helping to save the
building if sufficient public support was available.

Duncan Black unearths the hidden depths below an Army training camp in
rural Perthshire and the vital role it could play in the event of a
national crisis
IN THE ground below an Army training camp in rural Perthshire lies
what is usually one of Scotland's best kept secrets.
Set against a backdrop of beautiful hills and surrounded by fields
where cattle and sheep graze contentedly, the Cultybraggan camp near
Comrie has a picture-postcard location. It seems an unlikely spot to
find an establishment designed to play a crucial role in times of
national crisis.
But under the neatly-arranged rows of Nissen huts is a bunker which
would be available for use as an emergency centre of Government in the
event of war.
Completed five years ago at a cost of #3.6m, the bunker is also the
nerve centre of Scotland's Emergency Communications Network which links
all local authorities, emergency services, a number of Government
departments and other locations.
Since the ending of the Cold War, most civil defence facilities across
the country have been closed or put to new uses.
In Peebles, for example, a nuclear bunker under a school has been
converted into classrooms. A former nuclear command centre at Anstruther
in Fife has been turned into a museum and another near Livingston in
West Lothian has become a nightclub. Other suggested uses for old civil
defence facilities have included mushroom farms and even hibernation
centres for bats.
But the Cultybraggan bunker remains ready to perform its defensive
duties.
By the very nature of such places, i.e. for security reasons, much
secrecy surrounds the facility. But last week came a rare mention in the
public domain, spelling out its specific function.
Appropriately, the information was issued in a quiet and discreet
manner. It came from Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton in the form of written answers in the House of Commons
to questions submitted by Mrs Margaret Ewing, the Scottish National
Party MP and defence spokesperson.
She had asked, among other questions, how many civil defence
facilities in Scotland it was envisaged would be used as emergency
centres of Government during a war.
In his response, Lord James said there was one purpose-built civil
defence facility, at Cultybraggan, which would be available for this
purpose.
He also stated: ''While much of the former Civil Defence
infrastructure has been sold or dismantled, the Cultybraggan facility
will be retained, since it houses the central node of the Emergency
Communications Network.''
This network, he explained, was available to local authorities when
responding to civil emergencies in peace time, and had proved to be most
useful during the ''severe weather emergencies'' of 1993 and 1994.
Even in geographical terms, the bunker is something of a recluse. The
camp under which it is located is tucked away in Glen Artney and appears
to loom out of nowhere as you round a bend on the B827. A few hundred
yards further along, a sharp turn on to a side road takes you to the
camp gates.
Which is as far as The Herald reached when we went in search of the
elusive civil defence facility. A request at the guardroom for access to
photograph the bunker was politely but firmly, and not at all
surprisingly, declined.
Furthermore, we were advised that any further approaches about the
object of our quest should be directed to the Army's Scottish HQ in
Edinburgh.
Undaunted, we decided to find out if local people knew of the
facility's existence and, if so, how much they knew about its exact
purpose. Many of them seemed to know there was a bunker of some kind as
they remembered hearing about its construction at the time. But few
realised its precise significance.
First stop was Cultybraggan Farm, right next to the camp. There, head
stockman Bruce Nelson said: ''I knew there was a bunker there but I did
not know it was that important. But they do seem to spend a lot of money
and time looking after the camp, so it must be important.
''I think local people know it is there but probably do not realise
what it is for. I know one local lad who thought the bunker was an
ammunition dump, and he has lived around here all his life.''
Then it was on to the little town of Comrie. There, Mr Sandy Gray,
newsagent and chairman of the community council, said: ''We knew about
the bunker from the day it was constructed. Most people know it is
there. I don't know if people were fully aware at the time what its
purpose was, but I think they probably do now.''
Well, not necessarily. Mrs Moira Duguid snatched a moment from her
school crossing patrol duties to tell us: ''I know of its existence but
that is about it. I certainly did not know it was a communications
centre or whatever.
''The bunker was talked about at the time when it was being built but
not a lot. I have heard about it but I would not be able to take you to
it.''
Mrs Susie Fotheringham, a pensioner, said: ''I did not know what the
bunker was used for. I am not sure that I even knew exactly where it
was, and I have lived here 37 years.''
At the Royal Hotel, proprietor Nigel Matheson, said: ''I have heard
talk about it, I have spoken to local tradesmen who carried out work on
it. I was aware it was there. But I was not aware of its exact role.''
He added that he was glad that the facility was being retained and
that, unlike many other defence establishments, the training camp was
still open. It was good for businesses in the town.
Next, The Herald turned its attention to who had been responsible for
dragging the bashful bunker into the public arena, albeit briefly. Step
forward, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
It appears that it made sure the SNP was aware of the Cultybraggan
facility's existence and suspected purpose. Mrs Ewing, the MP for Moray,
told us that as a defence spokesperson, she had agreed to submit
questions on the matter. ''Unpaid for, I must add,'' she laughed.
''I just wanted to find out what was happening in civil defence. There
seemed to have been quite a bit of controversy because there was a fair
amount of money spent on this facility, on the basis that it was going
to be a Government hideaway in the event of nuclear warfare.
''What annoys me about these establishments is that there is not
anything there for ordinary civilians. Presumably the likes of you and I
are expected to build our own bunkers. My view is why should they be
reserved for the Government? What happens to the public?''
Scottish CND administrator John Ainslie said it had approached the SNP
in a bid to get an official statement of the bunker's purpose. He said:
''It seems that in the event of nuclear war, Scotland will be run from
Cultybraggan.
''There is a general perception that civil defence facilities are all
closed down, but there is still a command bunker for Scottish Office
Ministers to go to. They have still got their preparations at that high
level of Government for them to be able to survive a nuclear war.''
Mr Ainslie, who said that the bunker had been built as a single
replacement for two former command centres in Scotland, added: ''We are
just trying to highlight the fact that this kind of nuclear
establishment is still around.''
The questions submitted by Mrs Ewing included the cost of an
unfinished civil defence facility in the grounds of Peel Hospital near
Galashiels. Lord James told her the site had been purchased for #100,000
and added: ''Because of the change in the perceived threat of a major
conflict, no start was made on construction work, and the site is
currently being offered for sale.''

THE Church of Scotland might be forced to close some of its
loss-making residential homes for the elderly, and the Government is
being blamed for a huge financial crisis.
The move follows protests to Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of
Carmyllie and to Prime Minister John Major over the shortfall in
Government funding which has forced the Church -- Scotland's biggest
provider of independent homes for the elderly -- to sell assets worth
more than #10m to cover losses over the past five years.
A review of the 38 homes, with 1100 residents, is under way with a
meeting scheduled for next month to discuss where the axe might fall
after a warning from the Church's stewardship and finance board that the
deficit could not be allowed to continue.
The Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Church's board of social
responsibility, said that he had raised the ''financial care gap'' with
Lord Fraser but no solution had been found.
The Government pays #197 a week for each elderly resident eligible for
benefit while the Church homes' average cost is #310. Lord Fraser had
suggested the board might consider dual registration of the board's
homes as nursing homes which attract a higher rate -- #98 a week more --
but that was not considered ''a realistic proposition''.
''I think it is pretty obvious to everyone that we cannot go on like
this much longer. Our staff are undertaking a major review at present.
There is a real possibility that some homes will close within the next
year.''
Mr Wallace, from Wick, added: ''It is the poorest people in the
country we are talking about -- poor, elderly people who cannot pay the
cost of residential care themselves.''
A motion to the General Assembly this week notes with ''serious
concern'' the financial position of the board as a result of the
continuing existence of the financial care gap and urges the Church to
''support the board's efforts to persuade Her Majesty's Government to
meet its financial responsibilities''.
Mr Iain Baillie, the Church of Scotland director of social work, said
he had written to Mr Major setting out the care gap which he said was
the result of Government policies.
''You cannot half wages in order to meet competition from the private
sector. It would be immoral to pay the rates they get paid elsewhere. It
is no use bleating private sector to us. The private sector are paying
peanuts and we are caught in that,'' he added.
''The Government has been totally irresponsible in the way they have
dealt with this.''
A spokesman for Lord Fraser said local authorities had been given #40m
earmarked to help make up for the ''care gap''.

THOSE who have endured the anguish of a day's work on their word
processor being wiped by the wrong stroke of a key might begin to
understand what certain Kirk leaders are feeling this morning.
In their case it is the work of a year. Of late night phone calls and
tedious meetings to hammer out compromises. Of long drafting sessions as
they prepared a report that the General Assembly had commissioned, only
to see the self-same Assembly flush away their work with as much
contempt as the average housewife has for toilet waste.
On day one of the Assembly it happened twice to highly significant
reports and has left those who are normally described as ''Kirk
leaders'' depressed and disillusioned about the Kirk's capacity to get
its act together amid gathering gloom.
The first instance was over the introduction of a retirement age of 75
for ministers and elders from membership of presbyteries and the
Assembly itself. The proposal was before the Assembly for the second
year running (under procedure which requires a double amen for such
changes).
It had received the necessary majority vote from presbyteries, but
discontent from elders had been mounting. A compromise deal would have
allowed ministers who already held their seats in presbytery to stay on,
but the eldest of the elders, who are elected annually, would have been
pruned. Yesterday the elders saw to it that they will remain elders in
name and in reality by throwing out the carefully crafted legislation.
My understanding of Church law is that it would be perfectly possible
for the board of practice and procedure to bring back its proposal and
get the second ''amen'' at next year's Assembly, but it will probably
not risk it.
The board saw what happened on Saturday night to the Assembly Council
which had been asked to prioritise the Kirk's work in a time of
financial cuts: it ended up cut to pieces by the very people whose work
was being assessed. It was a sour note for the Rev David Munro, the
hardworking convener of the council who steps down this year.
If he played the role of Caesar, the role of Brutus was competed for
by a number of conveners who first paid tribute to the courtesy of Mr
Munro and his faithful Mark Antony (Ron Blakey) before putting the knife
in.
The role of Cassius undoubtedly belonged to the principal clerk, Dr
James Weatherhead, who made a lengthy speech in which he tried to accuse
the council of basing its report on the wrong premise, an unfair charge
but one that showed how much he resents the attempts of the council to
take a more managerial role within the Kirk offices he once bestrode
like a Colossus.
The tribune of the people was surprisingly a former Moderator. The
Very Rev Professor James Whyte had already led the revolt against the
75-rule in the morning and urged a ''grass roots rebellion to liberate
parishes'' from what he saw as ''a top heavy, top down church'' and one
''increasingly centralised''.
This is the Kirk's central problem. It wants to be a national church
and that requires central planning. Historically its authority lay with
presbyteries and the Assembly. Now the Assembly committees have a
powerful role and the council tries to hold the reins. But as soon as it
pulls on the reins, the committees bridle and want to buck the trend.
When all the rhetoric of Saturday has been tucked away on CD for
posterity, the fact remains that the Kirk cannot afford to do all that
it wants to do. It told the council to prepare a prophecy statement and
when it came back, couched in accountancy language, they stoned the
prophet.
There is another serious consequence of Saturday's rebellions. They
show how difficult it is becoming for the Kirk to obtain consensus for
change and a great deal of energy has been wasted in proving the point.
The body which this week will ask its members to treat the National
Lottery with contempt, has become a lottery in which those who toil for
two years to produce a report can end up losers. It is difficult to see
who are the winners in such a system.

ELDERS over the age 75 unexpectedly won the right to continue to sit
in presbyteries after that age in the opening business session on
Saturday.
The committee on returns to overtures reported that a proposal to
limit the age when elders could be members of the higher courts of the
Church to 75 had gained approval from 30 presbyteries to 18 against
under Barrier Act procedure. The committee wanted the proposal made a
standing law of the Church.
Mr Maxwell Thornton, session clerk of St Columba's, Stirling, opposing
the proposal, said mistakes had been made because originally the
Assembly had looked for a solution to the problem of retired ministers
continuing to sit in presbyteries. But legislation for retired ministers
should not apply to active elders.
The Very RevDr James Weatherhead, principal clerk, pleaded for the
proposal to be passed. It was not an idea dreamed up by the board of
practice and procedure and was not a centralising thing.
The Assembly, however, supported Mr Thornton by 305 to 248 in a card
vote.

THREE Kirk boards have been saved from getting their budgets cut. In a
debate marked by a barrage of criticism, the Assembly rejected the plan
by the Assembly council to reduce the 1997 allocations to the Board of
Communication by #100,000, the Board of National Mission by #110,000,
and the Board of World Mission by #140,000.
The total of #350,000 would have formed the major part of an increase
of #400,000 intended for the maintenance of the ministry committee.
The Assembly council said in its report that the Church could not
afford to maintain its present level of funding to chaplaincies in
industry and universities, and could not support the continuation of the
Kirk's society, religion, and technology project.
The Rev David Munro, convener of the Assembly council, said it had
been instructed to appraise the relative priority of the work of the
Kirk's boards and had decided the priority task of the Church must be
the mission to the people of Scotland.
The adjustment of #400,000 was necessary to let the Church fulfil its
missionary role adequately without exhausting its funds for support of
the ministry.
The Rev Ian Black, convener of the Board of National Mission, opposing
the reductions, said they narrowed unacceptedly the vision of the
Church's mission to the whole world and threatened to destroy it.
A genuine attempt to create work for the future would be undermined by
the imposition of redundancies of loyal servants and there would be no
room to manoeuvre.
''The Assembly's proposals fall short,'' Mr Black said. ''They neither
meet the challenge of the age nor fit the mood of today or tomorrow
within the Church.
''They will lead to the mission of the Church disappearing down a
vortex of short term expediency.''
The Rev John Spiers, vice-convener of the Board of World Mission, said
the impression was being given of ''a shrinking Church which has no
vision, and a maintenance Church rather than a missionary Church''.
Mr Spiers said the Assembly council appeared to support its own
statement that ''a Church turned in upon itself will wither and die''.
The Rev Margaret Forrester, convener of the Board of World Mission,
said the Church had to be ''where the pain is''. Money had become a
controlling and deadening factor.
The Rev John Chalmers, convener of the Board of Ministry, said the
board's reserves would continue to be eaten into. If it was the
Assembly's will to make no cuts in work at the cutting edge, it must
also be its will to find other ways of ministering to Scotland that
would be less of a drain on central reserves.
Replying to the debate, Mr Munro said it was grossly unfair and
unworthy to suggest the Assembly council was turning the Church in on
itself.
The council had consulted with boards to ascertain their priorities
and fulfilled its remit on that basis. The Church did not have the money
to do all it wanted to do and had to make a choice.
Mr Black's counter motion was clearly carried.
Earlier in the debate on the council's report, the Very Rev Professor
James Whyte, former moderator, said the Church was becoming increasingly
centralised.

MORE has to be done to attract young people into the Church of
Scotland, the Very Rev Dr James Simpson, the outgoing Moderator of the
General Assembly, said in Edinburgh last night. Reporting to the
Assembly on his year of office, he said: ''As a Church we need to do a
lot of rethinking so that young people who are genuinely interested in
exploring faith and spirituality may once again find the Church a
vehicle of grace.
''We have to find new ways of tapping into that surge of vitality and
love which takes visionary young people to Taize or Iona, and looks for
social changes through Greenpeace or Amnesty International.''
He said his one criticism of his presbytery visits was there was
insufficient emphasis on him meeting with young adults and young
parents.
''One of the greatest tasks confronting the Church is to reach and
involve this age category. Their music, ministry, and insights are, I am
sure, just as honouring to God as ours.''
Emphasising the value of the family, he wished people in the West were
aware it was still within the family the values and characteristics of
the next generation were shaped and developed. There was no stronger
teacher of the religious imagination than the home.
''If children are once again to acquire a meaningful foundation in
Christian faith and morals, it will be through deliberate, disciplined
instruction in the home and Church.
''The future of the Church passes by way of the family. It is in the
home and with the parents that the mission of the Church must start.''
He said Britain had changed to a culture with an official background
which was more and more secular. People in the West had been brainwashed
by the media into a pagan secularism, but he was certain Britain was not
atheistic.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S most senior law official, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, has
angered the Free Presbyterian Church once again.
The Lord Chancellor quit the strict church in 1989 when it disciplined
him for attending the funeral of a legal colleague in a Roman Catholic
church.
Now, officials from the Free Presbyterian Church have criticised him
for trying to make divorce laws more flexible.
In a report on morals, the Free Presbyterian Church gives its most
illustrious former member a Bible lesson on which couples should be
allowed to split.
Lord Mackay is known to favour ''no-fault'' divorce in cases where
blame cannot be attributed to either party.
He believes such a change in legislation would make it possible for
some couples to settle a dispute out of court.
The Free Presbyterian report states: ''In the Lord Chancellor's
opinion, there is a lot of support for the view that mediation can do a
great deal to help people solve their own problems.
''In particular, he says, it would reduce the trauma and damage for
themselves and their children.
''But while some with disturbed marriages might benefit, we hold
firmly to the view that the only biblical grounds for divorce are
adultery and wilful desertion.''
The report adds: ''The Word of God makes no provision for no-fault
divorce, as we are sure the Lord Chancellor himself knows full well.''
The report will be presented to the Free Presbyterian Synod in
Inverness tomorrow.

A STRONG plea for people on the margins of society was made by Lady
Fraser, Her Majesty's High Commissioner, when she addressed the General
Assembly on Saturday.
''The underclass which eats into the health of our society -- not just
here in Scotland but everywhere in the affluent world -- is more
pronounced,'' she said. The Church and State must address the problems
involved, she added, but they were also matters for each individual to
take on board.

CRIME prevention measures to protect places of worship from thieves
and vandals were announced yesterday.
As householders and businesses improve their security the Church, with
its open doors and valuable artefacts, is looked on by thieves as an
easy target to plunder.
The Scottish Office, after talks with the Scottish Crime Prevention
Council, has produced a booklet giving advice to congregations on what
measures are needed to lessen the chance of break-ins at churches and
vandal attacks on graveyards.
Points put forward to improve security include replacing valuable
artefacts with replicas, putting anti-climb paint, which is slippery and
does not dry, on to the pipes up to the roof, fitting metal grilles on
iron frames to windows, bolting and cementing the offertory boxes in
place on the wall and firmly setting the church safe into the floor.
Locking the church at all times to keep out intruders is left to the
individual congregation to decide. Visiting graveyards in evenings or
school holidays, when vandalism is most likely to occur, will cut down
attacks.
The most up-to-date figures for insurance claims by Church groups for
theft and malicious damage to property increased by 71.4% from 1989 to
1993.
Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie said it was sad such
crime prevention measures were necessary and that places of worship were
no longer sacrosanct.
Lord Fraser said: ''There was a time when places of worship, by their
very nature as sacred places, escaped attention from the thief and
vandal.
''Regrettably society has changed and values have dropped. The reality
now is that these premises are just as vulnerable to attack as any other
building.
''Indeed it could be argued that, because places of worship require to
remain accessible to visitors and those who want to use them for private
prayer, they are even more at risk.
''Finding the balance between security and accessibility can be
difficult. With just a little thought and the introduction of sensible
security measures, which often need not be expensive, the chances of
property and worshippers becoming victims of crime can be greatly
reduced.''
Mr Andrew McLellan, convener of the Kirk's Church and Nation Committee
said: ''I welcome guidelines which will help people to take steps to
protect property. At the same time it is important that churches can be
left open because the Church should not have to close to the public.
''It is very sad we have to address these matters but I am sure no
amount of security of buildings will stop mindless vandalism until we
address the despair, anger, and sense of uselessness which corrupts the
lives of so many young people in Scotland.''
Mr Danny McLaughlin, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church, said:
''I am aware that this is a growing problem. Very few churches in the
country have not been the victims of theft or vandalism.
''However, this growing problem does reflect a trend in society much
more worrying than the damage to churches.''
Already this year Cardonald cemetery, Cathcart Hebrew cemetery, and
Lambhill cemetery have all been hit by vandals. Others hit in the past
two years include a cemetery for newborn babies in Irvine. Two benches
were smashed at Knadgerhill cemetery in the new town at the graveyard
for stillborn babies or for those who die shortly after birth.
There has also been cases of a church being ransacked in Auchinleck in
Ayrshire and antique brass candlesticks being stolen from a village
church near Peebles.

THE first steps to curb ''cowboy'' boats on Loch Lomond are under way,
with computer lists set to brand loch users.
Owners are being advised to start registration procedures if they
intend to sail on the loch this summer.
An official with Loch Lomond Park Authority, which is to administer
the new scheme, said yesterday: ''Everyone who intends to take to the
water is strongly urged to complete a form and return it to us as early
as possible to enable the application to be processed.''
Application forms have already been delivered to marinas, hotels, and
clubs around the loch, advising members to begin registering so that
computerised records can be compiled.
They will be issued with an identification number which must be
displayed on the vessel.
Although Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has not yet formally confirmed
the new by-laws, he is expected to do so next month.
The Park Authority is also preparing a special booklet, containing a
safe navigation map of the loch, which will show the location of new
hazard buoys.
The regulations will be enforced by rangers who will police the
speeding boats and jet-skiers in a #70,000 patrol boat.
The new legal curbs will ensure that:
* Every power-driven boat is registered.
* A close-to-shore speed limit of six knots is observed.
* New safe navigation rules are implemented.
Until this year, it has been possible to take any size or type of
craft and drive it at any speed anywhere on the loch.

<TEXT>
MEDIA baron Rupert Murdoch has disclosed that he is on the horns of a
dilemma over which political leader to support -- because he cannot tell
John Major and Tony Blair apart.
Mr Murdoch, who once said he could imagine backing Mr Blair, admits to
being confused by comparisons between the Labour leader and Mr Major.
In a recorded interview to be shown on tonight's Money Programme on
BBC2, Mr Murdoch was asked if he intended to support Mr Blair.
He replied: ''Well, we'll have to find out what the difference is
between Mr Blair and Mr Major before we make that decision . . . Right
now, from this distance it's rather confusing.''
In the past Mr Murdoch's papers, especially the Sun, have always been
strongly pro-Tory -- although in the Money Programme interview he denied
ever having very good relations with British Ministers.
Questioned on whether he was preparing for a Labour government, he
said his broadsheets, The Times and Sunday Times, would support whomever
their editors wished.
But he expected to have ''some input'' in the political stance of the
Sun. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Murdoch dismissed as ''absolute
nonsense'' the suggestion that he made his unexpectedly low #2m
consortium bid for Channel 5 after being offered a deal to avoid a
political storm.

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978272526</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE result of a crucial second poll to gauge support on Harris for the
island's planned superquarry will be known today.
Speculation is high that islanders may have swung against the
controversial plan by minerals giant Redland Aggregates to quarry into
the 1507ft mountain Rionneabhal at tiny Lingerbay.
The company wants to extract 600,000,000 tonnes of anorthosite for
European motorways. After 60 years of quarrying the result would be one
of the largest holes in Europe, which could be seen from the moon.
Western Isles Islands Council has already given planning permission
but the green light is ultimately up to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Initial hopes of jobs and prosperity for the islands' depressed
economy have faded as evidence has unfolded. Many believe the
environmental impact of dust, noise, vibration, and sea pollution could
be too great.
As in the first referendum, in June 1993, today's poll will be spread
over Harris's three electoral wards. In 1993, in Obbe, where the quarry
would be, it was 50.4% against and 49.6% for. Tarbert ward was 64.3% for
and 35.7% against, while Bays was 75.8% for and 24.2% against.
But successive expert witnesses have claimed there would be few local
opportunities and pollution could decimate the existing fishing
industry. Tourism, a mainstay of the fragile economy, could also suffer.

EGG thieves have raided three osprey nests across Scotland. Around 10
eggs were stolen in the raids which took place at separate sites in
north Perthshire and in Strathspey, near Aviemore.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says the raids were
carried out professionally by egg collectors.
The eggs were taken within the past week.
Last night Mr David Mitchell, Scottish spokesman for the RSPB, said:
''We are really sickened by this. It was definitely collectors because
the trees were scaled with climbing irons and it was a professional job.
They knew what they were doing.''
Around 120 pairs of ospreys are nesting in Scotland this year and each
pair lays a clutch of about three eggs.
Mr Mitchell added: ''This theft is very disappointing and selfish. It
will hard hit a species which is now making a comeback.''

<HEADLINE>Explosions for new ferry terminal. Harbour blasts 'damage shops and offices'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978272528</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BLASTING for the new ferry terminal in Stornoway harbour has caused
tens of thousands of pounds of damage to seafront buildings, it was
claimed yesterday.
A floating rig has been using high explosives on the harbour bottom at
Newton Basin, a few hundred yards from shops and offices on South Beach
Street.
The blasts, preparatory work for the new ferry terminal, have rocked
the centre of Stornoway for weeks. However, it is only now that the full
extent of the damage has become clear.
At the workshop of engineers Ian Maciver &amp; Co on Shell Street several
walls have big cracks from floor to ceiling. Part of the floor at the
back of the building, closest to the seafront, has also cracked.
Mr Maciver said: ''I've had to call in independent consultants at my
own expense to assess the damage and monitor it in case it gets worse.
''I'm not too concerned at the moment. I've been told there's no
danger of the building falling down.''
Highly sensitive equipment in Mr Maciver's workshop has also been
affected by the powerful tremors.
A 20ft centre lathe was precision-set to three thousandths of an inch.
The shudders from the blasting have now made it unusable. ''It'll have
to be completely re-set again.
''I don't know yet if I'll be compensated for all this or if I have to
claim on my own insurance,'' Mr Maciver said.
The independent consultant hired by Mr Maciver to monitor the damage
is Dr George Macleod, the former chief executive of Western Isles
Islands Council.
In the aftermath of the BCCI affair in which the council lost almost
#24m, Dr Macleod was suspended, reinstated, and then resigned soon
afterwards.
He now runs his own civil engineering consultancy, Macleod Associates.
Dr Macleod was not available for comment yesterday.
Mr Tony Morrison also has an engineering business nearby. Daylight can
be seen through gaping cracks in the outer walls of his workshop.
Other businesses on the seafront were unwilling to discuss the damage
they suffered.
The manager of one said: ''The Pier and Harbour Commission are our
landlords. We don't want to speak to the press about this.''
Abarok Ali's Indian restaurant on South Beach Street has many fresh
hairline cracks in the seafront wall.
He said: ''I don't know what to do. I can't afford to repair this.''
Mrs Annette Capaldi and her husband, Horace, stay above Merchant's
Coffee House in the town centre.
Mrs Capaldi said: ''I was on the phone the other day and the whole
building shook. I thought it was an earthquake.
''It was very scary. We've had no notification about this at all.''
The main contractor for the new ferry terminal is Babtie, Shaw &amp;
Morton. No-one was available for comment at their Stornoway office
yesterday.
Stornoway Pier and Harbour Commission refused to discuss the extent of
the damage. General manager, Mr Murdoch Macleod, said: ''I'm not going
to tell you anything.''

A DOZEN Scottish companies arrived in the US yesterday in search of a
bigger share of a $75bn market. They operate in the forefront of one of
the world's most rapidly advancing sectors.
The world market for products based on opto-electronics is forecast to
grow to $450m in the next 20 years, according to the Opto-Electronics
Industry Development Association.
A wide range of such products is already in use, including laser
scanners at supermarket check-outs.
Opto-electronics also makes possible laser surgery which can reshape
the lens of the eye, removing the need for glasses or contact lenses.
Although Scotland's opto-electronics industry is small compared to
Japan, which has 70% of the sector's world output, the 25 main companies
are at the forefront of research. Half of UK Government funding in the
area comes to Scotland.
The sector, which includes larger companies such as Pilkington
Optronics and GEC Marconi, has a combined turnover of #100m. Scottish
Enterprise has an opto-electronics team within its Information
Industries group and last October a Scottish Opto-Electronics
Association was formed to provide a two-way flow of information between
industry and the research community.
The association, which has 37 members, has set itself the target of
growing the sector's turnover to #250m in five years.
The Scottish companies are attending the CLEO (Conference on Laser and
Electro-Optics) exhibition in Baltimore.

THE parents of little Emma Hughes are praying that she will be given
the chance of living a normal life.
Emma and her twin sister Amy were born 110 days early in Glasgow's
Royal Maternity Hospital in 1993 and their survival is a world record
for prematurely-delivered twins.
But now, Emma has been diagnosed as having celebral palsy.
Her parents, Brian and Jane Hughes, of Cumbernauld, Dunbartonshire,
are hoping that Emma will pass a series of tests and be offered a place
at the Craig Albert Centre, three miles from their home, which is geared
exclusively to cerebral palsy sufferers.
The centre's success rate is impressive and Mr and Mrs Hughes feel
this is their best chance to boost Emma's chances of a healthy and happy
future.
''Emma's not the sort of girl to be placed in a special school for the
severely handicapped.
''She's a bright, intelligent girl with a real zest for life,'' said
Mr Hughes, who gave up his job to look after his wife and children.
''We are convinced that with special help and treatment she can go on
to live the full and normal life every child deserves.''
When the twins were born 21 months ago, Emma was the heavier of the
two at 1lb 14oz. Amy weighed 1lb 7oz. The first glimpse of his daughters
brought Mr Hughes nothing but fear and despair.
For the first three weeks, the anxious parents could only take each
day as it came.
''It was the most traumatic time of our lives. Every minute Emma and
Amy remained alive seemed like a miracle but we knew they could be
plucked from us at any time,'' said Mrs Hughes.
Against all expectations, and thanks to the expertise and devotion of
surgeons, doctors and nurses at the Royal Maternity Hospital, the twins
survived to become record-breakers. They put on weight and were allowed
home.
''The first time we were able to hold the two of them together in our
own home was the proudest and happiest we could ever remember.
''We felt we had been granted a gift from God,'' said Mr Hughes.
''Their medical prognosis was slightly cloudy and we were aware there
would always be a risk of brain or other damage, but as the weeks passed
they grew stronger and healthier and at last it was beginning to look as
though we could look forward to a future we had always dreamed of,'' he
added.
Then their euphoria was shattered. Both girls required delicate micro
heart surgery and both were diagnosed as suffering from hyper-calcerina,
a rare allergy to calcium which means that sufferers must avoid
chocolates, dairy products, and even cornflakes.
However, the heart surgery was successful and the special diets seemed
to be working.
Last Christmas, when the twins were 15 months old, was the happiest
the Hughes could remember.
Then, at the beginning of this year, their spirits dipped again.
Mr and Mrs Hughes had begun to notice that Amy was developing more
quickly than her sister. She could crawl earlier, stand earlier, and had
better balance and co-ordination. As the gap between the girls'
abilities widened, their fears increased. Finally, after a series of
tests, it was confirmed that Emma had cerebral palsy.
The couple saw doctors, specialists, psychiatrists, self-help groups.
Now, they believe they have found the answer -- the Craig Albert Centre
-- and hope that the next round of tests and interviews will bring about
a successful outcome.

A SCOTS expert on the effects of trauma flew to America last night to
talk to rescue workers involved in the Oklahoma bombing.
Ms Yvonne McEwen, from Edinburgh, has previously worked with terrorist
victims in Northern Ireland, rescue workers involved in the Lockerbie
disaster, and victims of civil rights abuse in Romania.
The former nurse has also been called in to deal with the aftermath of
terrorism and civil unrest in Hungary, India, and the Czech Republic.
Ms McEwen has been asked to pass on her expertise to those involved in
the bombing, which killed 168 people, by the American Government team
responsible for dealing with such emergencies.
As she left for the meeting in Washington, Ms McEwen said the rescuers
would be tormenting themselves by trying to work out why the atrocity
had taken place.
Ms McEwen, the former trauma officer of Lothian and Borders fire
brigade, said: ''When I get to the States I expect some of the rescue
workers I meet will be mentally ragged.
''Others, being Americans will act macho and try to give the
impression they have been unaffected.
''They will be asking themselves what sort of people carry out such
atrocities and asking what makes people kill young children in bombings
like this one.
''I will be telling them not to torment themselves by wasting time
trying to work out why the attack took place.
''This will be difficult because it seems the people behind it were
not members of a foreign terrorist organisation but Americans just like
themselves.
''There is no stereo-type of terrorist, the only thing they seem to
share is that they are disillusioned and dissaffected.''
Ms McEwen has just finished working in Northern Ireland with families
who, through the years, had been bombed out of their homes.
She said she had been asked to meet rescue workers in America by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.

<HEADLINE>Minimum wage 'a benefit' to Scots</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN SMITH</BYLINE>

<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978272532</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S Scottish economic spokesman, Mr John McFall, yesterday
insisted that his party's plans for a minimum wage would be of
particular benefit to Scotland. However, there are growing indications
that Labour may be changing its stance on the minimum wage.
Many unions have been campaigning for Labour to declare a national
minimum wage of around #4 an hour for the whole country.
The latest suggestions, however, are that Labour may opt instead for a
minimum wage with regional variations or variations within different
industries. The second option would be more in line with reintroducing
wages councils, which were recently scrapped.
Regional variations may mean a lower minimum wage in areas with lower
average wages -- such as Scotland.
Although Labour insists that it will press ahead with plans for a
minimum wage, it is unlikely that it will put a figure on it before the
next election.
Nevertheless, Mr McFall stated it would be particularly beneficial in
Scotland because of the higher proportion of people on low incomes
compared with the UK average.
He said that in the UK as a whole more than 1.6 million people were
earning less than #2.50 an hour.
''Every year the public purse pays out #2400m in benefits for people
who do not earn enough to live on. The taxpayer shouldn't have to
subsidise a growing number of people who are on low pay because their
employer will not pay them a proper wage,'' he added.
Mr McFall argued that employers were encouraged by the lack of a
minimum wage to pay low wages in the knowledge that the taxpayer would
''pick up the tab''.
Meanwhile, Labour MP Brian Donohoe has countered the recent good news
about falling unemployment in Scotland by claiming that the figures also
showed that nine Scots were competing for every job vacancy.
He claimed the figures meant that Government employment policies were
not working, and allowed significant levels of unemployment to continue
unchecked.
The worst ratio recorded was in Barrhead, Renfrewshire, where there
were 2160 registered unemployed and only 47 unfilled vacancies -- a
ratio of 45 unemployed for every job recorded at the Jobcentre.
* Employment Secretary Michael Portillo today launched a new frontal
assault on Euro-rules, which he claimed were designed to heap extra
burdens on business.
He accused Brussels bureaucrats of holding the ''pistol of legal
compulsion to the heads of business'' through a directive forcing large
companies to appoint works councils for staff consultation.
Mr Portillo, standard bearer of the Tory right and leading Cabinet
Euro-sceptic, said the controversial opt-out from the Social Chapter of
the Maastricht treaty had saved British business from the
''straitjacket'' of the rules.

often requires foreign expertise.
The delegation, accompanied by officials from the Japanese External
Trade Organisation, is the second major Japanese visit from the
shipbuilding and repair sector in recent months.
Glasgow Development Agency explored the possibility of links by
publishing a Scottish marine equipment directory in Japanese last year.
A GDA spokesman said that it sparked off substantial interest, and was
followed up by a visit in November of more than 20 shipbuilding and
marine engineering purchasing executives to Glasgow. The majority of the
Scottish companies they met said they confidently expected to secure
orders as a result.
Mr Stuart Gulliver, GDA chief executive, said the fact that a second
major Japanese delegation had arrived within months augured well.
He added: ''We began this exercise because we had become aware through
our sources within the marine engineering industry that the Japanese
might be interested in the products and services which Scottish
companies were able to supply.
''However, the level at which that interest has been pitched has been
far greater than we expected.''.''

THE Spanish father at the centre of a custody fight said last night
that he would be prepared to travel to Scotland regularly, if a Spanish
court decided his estranged wife could take their daughter back to
Edinburgh.
''What I want is regular access to my daughter,'' said Mr Jose Cortes.
''If Catherine wants to take the child back to Scotland that is fine so
long as I can see Lucia regularly.
''I would be prepared to go to Scotland once a month to see her. But
the courts here have to decide that.''
He has hired a luxury beachside flat for his Scots wife and their
14-month-old baby daughter, Lucia, while they wait for a court to decide
her future.
He also claimed yesterday, that he has filled it with toys and a cot
and put up a sign saying: ''Welcome home Lucia!''
The 36-year-old waiter, known to thousands of holidaymakers from
Scotland as Pepe, said yesterday at The Scotsman Bar, Benidorm, where he
has worked for 15 years: ''It's one of the best flats in town. It is
costing me a lot of money. But I want access to my daughter and I want
somewhere nice and comfortable for her to stay.''
He intends to hand the key over to Catherine Johnston, 25, who left
him last December to take Lucia, then only eight months old, back to
Edinburgh, when she arrives in Benidorm following a court ruling in
Scotland.
Ms Johnston flew to Spain yesterday to comply with the Edinburgh
judgment that a Spanish court must decide what access Lucia's father has
to the child.
She and her parents were accompanied by representatives of a Glasgow
newspaper which was reported to be paying their fares, but yesterday Mr
Cortes was still waiting to see his daughter for the first time for six
months.
''They flew first to Barcelona and then went to Malaga instead of
coming here,'' he said. ''They're making a good holiday of it.'' Malaga,
the capital of the Costa del Sol, is some 300 miles from Benidorm.
Mr Cortes claims that Ms Johnston took Lucia back to Scotland without
warning. He said: ''Now they are making me out to be some sort of
monster -- that's what they've been calling me in Scotland.
''But I've had calls from friends all over Scotland who know me from
the bar telling me they just can't believe what they've been reading
about me. I'm very grateful for their support.''
He denied that he had ill-treated Ms Johnston, who has said that she
fears for Lucia's safety if she stays in Spain.
He said angrily: ''That is nonsense. I just want to be able to see my
daughter and play with her when I want to.''
He added: ''This whole thing has cost me a fortune. I've had a lawyer
here for five months and another in Scotland. Then there have been all
the phone calls to Britain.''
Mr Cortes said he thought it would be several months before a family
court at nearby Alicante made a ruling on the case. He is not seeking
custody of Lucia, but wants her to remain in Spain so he can have easy
access.
''At the moment the only thing I want is to be able to hold Lucia in
my arms and cuddle her. It now looks as if I will be able to do that
within the next few days. After that it is for the court to decide what
should happen.''
But he denied that he had spoken of a reconciliation with Ms Johnston.

PROTESTERS campaigning against the M77 in Glasgow are aiming to go to
the European courts to seek compensation for those living near the path
of the new motorway.
The campaign organisation, Glasgow for People, yesterday said it had
hired a leading environmental lawyer to fight for compensation for those
it claims could suffer health problems, such as asthma, as a result of
traffic using the motorway once it is completed.
It is hoped that evidence on alleged breaches of environmental
legislation will be collated and submitted to the European Commission.
The organisation then intends to take the case to the European Court
of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice.
If it is successful, it claims that the Government could be forced to
pay thousands of pounds in compensation to residents living in the
Corkerhill and Mosspark areas close to the route of the motorway
extension on the city's South Side.
The organisation has hired environmental law expert Liz Loughlan, the
lawyer involved in the high-profile legal bid to halt work on the
Newbury by-pass in England.
After a visit to Glasgow last week, Ms Loughlan said she was preparing
evidence over breaches in a series of European environmental directives.
''If the European Commission accept that there have been breaches,
then the case will be referred on to the European Court of Justice. That
would enable residents to go to the Scottish courts for compensation.
''There is also another avenue and that is compensation for violation
of human rights. If that bid is successful, residents could expect
compensation from the European Court of Human Rights.''
The organisation's Ian Cowan said that since trees in the motorway
path had been felled earlier this year and the protesters' camp fenced
off, many local residents felt the fight against the road had been lost.
While he said protestors could do little to halt the construction of
the road, already begun by contractors Wimpey, he added that most people
were unaware of their legal rights.
''By taking this action,'' he added, ''we hope to enable residents to
claim damages for personal injuries for conditions like asthma and for
noise and air pollution.''
He said that the action could cost thousands of pounds and that the
organisation was currently trying to raise the funds.
No-one from Wimpey was available to comment on the action.

<HEADLINE>Clarke mocks as Blair aims to lift low inflation priority</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978272537</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair will today bury once and for all the ''tax
and spend'' policies of the past: he will pledge a Labour government
making low inflation the cornerstone of its economic policies.
He is also expected to give a blunt warning to Labour supporters that
the road to lasting economic growth and prosperity will be long and
hard.
In a speech at London's City University which he regards as one of the
most important of his leadership, Mr Blair will seek to persuade the
City and business not only that Labour can be trusted to run the economy
but also that it has learned from the past failings of governments of
both parties.
He believes a credible economic policy will provide the foundation for
everything else the party wishes to achieve.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, meanwhile, said the Government's own
economic policy was supported by the opposition. He told BBC TV's On the
Record that Labour had remained silent on every Government action on the
economy for weeks.
''It sounds as though Tony Blair is going to be Bambi pretending to be
the Monarch of the Glen. There is no substance in all this,'' he said.
''I must be the first Chancellor who has a Shadow Chancellor who is
not criticising what I am doing. Gordon Brown's problem is he thinks
what I am doing is working. He has not for some time opposed anything I
have done.
''He knows it is working, he knows he could not do any better. He
knows I have not persuaded the public of this yet, but he believes over
the next two years this could get very worrying indeed.''
Mr Clarke insisted, despite Labour claims of a split, that he and Bank
of England Governor, Mr Eddie George, were united on the need to drive
down inflation and predicted price rises could be pegged to under 2% by
1997.
''No two people ever agree, no two economists ever agree from one
month to the next exactly what to do,'' he added.
Low inflation will also be the centrepiece of Mr Blair's speech with
an absolute commitment to it both as a worthwhile objective in itself
but also as an essential element in stimulating jobs and prosperity.
A leadership source said: ''Low and stable inflation is not an
alternative to long-term investment, but a condition for it. There will
be no room for quick-fix solutions or the short-term dash for growth.''
Mr Blair believes he can sell a commitment to a tough economic
strategy, an issue which has hampered Labour through four General
Elections, but will warn that the basic approach is long-term and
results could be some time in coming.
He will for the first time make the improvement of education and
training key economic rather than social objectives.
The Shadow Treasury chief secretary, Mr Andrew Smith, ridiculed Mr
Clarke's comments about Labour. ''Mr Clarke's claim that we do not
oppose the Government is totally ludicrous. Mr Clarke has now run out of
ideas and is running scared of new Labour's economic policies.''

RELATIVES of two men, sent to prison for three weeks until a
magistrate decides their punishment for shouting abuse, including racial
comments, at a convicted child sex offender, will hear tomorrow whether
they are to be freed on appeal pending sentence.
Paul Rainey, 28, and Barry McBride, 24, both of Netherplace Road,
Pollok, Glasgow, were charged with breach of the peace after shouting
and swearing at Iranian businessman Ali Najafian in the street last
summer and making racist comments.
Relatives believed the two men, who are said to have no criminal
record, might receive a small fine ''at most'' as punishment.
However, relief stipendiary magistrate Neil Boyd, found them guilty on
May 12, and remanded them in custody for three weeks, deferring sentence
until June 2.
McBride and Rainey are understood to have appeared at Glasgow District
Court without legal representation.
McBride was refused legal aid at the eleventh hour to defend the
charges against him and was informed of this on the day of the trial. As
a result no motion for bail was presented.
McBride's solicitor withdrew representation after his application for
legal aid was refused. A relative of the two men said Paisley-based
solicitors Robert Kerr had now taken up the case and would appeal to the
High Court in Edinburgh tomorrow for consent for bail.
Relatives of the two men were incensed at their imprisonment citing
the fact that Najafian was sentenced to 12 months' probation and ordered
to do 200 hours community service after admitting sex offences against
young girls.
The relatives yesterday claimed that much of Najafian's community
service was carried out doing gardening work in the grounds of the
Mohsen Nursing Home for the elderly in Netherplace Road, Pollok, owned
by his wife and brother.
The relatives have expressed fears that McBride, a semi-skilled worker
in a computer software factory in Hillington, could lose his job.
Rainey, 28, a registered carer, has looked after his paraplegic brother
Edward, 33, since 1984.
The relatives of the two men claim to be mystified and ''greatly
disillusioned'' over the court decision.
Mr McBride's father, Andy, 43, said yesterday at his flat in
Netherplace Road: ''The effect on all our lives has been devastating.
''We thought the lads would have got off with a warning or a small
fine at most.''
Mr McBride said he would appeal to local Labour MP for Glasgow Pollok,
Mr Jimmy Dunnachie, to call for an immediate investigation into the
circumstances of the case.
Najafian was not available for comment yesterday.
Solicitor-advocate, Mr Joe Beltrami, who acted for Najafian when he
appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court three years ago on the child sex
offence charges, said last night: ''My client was acquitted on the most
serious charges and was convicted of much less serious charges. That is
why he did not go to jail.''

A TEENAGE girl was throttled to death and sexually assaulted three
weeks after leaving her home because of domestic troubles, police said
yesterday.
The half-naked body of 14-year-old Janet Swanson was found by three
walkers in woodland behind a B&amp;Q store.
A police spokesman said a 15-year-old youth was helping police with
their inquiries.
Police yesterday had the task of telling her distraught parents, Hazel
and Andrew, both 33, that the teenager had been murdered.
The detective leading the hunt said it seemed Janet had been killed
''on the spur of the moment'' at the retail park off the busy A64 York
Road close to her family home in Killingbeck, Leeds, West Yorkshire.
0 He said the teenager had ben found lying in the open but he would
not comment on how she had been strangled. She had also suffered head
injuries.
Janet, who had been living at a children's home in the Pudsey area of
Leeds for three weeks, had left the family home because of ''domestic
troubles'', Mr Mawson said.
She had travelled back to the area where her parents, two brothers and
a sister, lived to visit another children's home, where she was believed
to have a friend.
She might have been making her way back to Pudsey when she was seen
waiting at a bus stop a few hundred yards from the murder scene.
''We really need to speak to anyone who may have seen her after that
time to get to know her movements,'' Mr Mawson said.
''The retail park would have been busy at that time because most of
the premises don't close until 8pm.''
Teenage girls who shared a children's home with Janet were described
as ''heartbroken'' over her death. Social service chiefs said there was
a profound feeling of shock and disbelief.
Mr Mike Evans, assistant director of social services for Leeds City
Council, said: ''It is an awful tragedy and everyone is absolutely
devastated. The other girls are heartbroken.''
He said Janet had only moved in about two weeks ago but had
''responded to the care treatment given and got on well with the other
residents.
''Janet had gone out for a few hours to visit a friend which she was
entitled to do. She went out with the full knowledge of out staff.''

A MAN jailed last week for the murder of an Ayrshire woman has been
questioned by detectives hunting the killer of Irvine woman Shona
Stevens, who died three days after being attacked as she walked home in
broad daylight last November.
A judge at the High Court in Kilmarnock jailed Edward Mullen for life
last Thursday, with a recommendation that he serve at least 15 years,
after he admitted the murder of Mrs Yvette Wilson, 27, on January 19 in
a bothy in West Kilbride railway station.
A Strathclyde Police spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that Mullen had
been interviewed in connection with the murder of Ms Stevens, who had a
seven-year-old daughter Candice.
A police spokeswoman said yesterday: ''We can confirm that Edward
Mullen has been questioned in connection with the Shona Stevens
investigation.'' The spokeswoman declined to comment further.
Ms Stevens, 31, a divorcee, was dragged into bushes and savagely
clubbed about the head by her attacker as she walked home at lunchtime
from shops through Middleton Park, in Bourtreehill, Irvine.
She died three days later in the neurosurgery unit of the Southern
General Hospital, Glasgow.
Detectives involved in the case confirmed in March that they were
looking to former boyfriends for help in finding Ms Stevens' killer.
They claimed she had relationships after she left her husband in South
Africa and returned to her mother's house in Irvine, Ayrshire.
Detectives also received several phone calls after the reconstruction
of the murder was shown on the BBC's Crimewatch UK programme in
February.
Mullen, 25, is understood to have been questioned at Barlinnie prison,
Glasgow, while awaiting trial for the murder of Mrs Wilson.
In September, 1991, at the High Court in Glasgow, he was convicted of
assault and roberry and assault with intent to ravish. He was released
from Peterhead Prison in June 1994 -- having been given remission -- and
lived in Ardrossan, then West Kilbride.
The High Court at Kilmarnock heard that Mrs Wilson, a waitress at
Inverkip Marina and part-time design student, had been on her way to an
evening out with friends when she was grabbed by Mullen.
She was taken into an outhouse, known locally as the bothy, where a
scarf was placed round her neck then stuffed into her mouth, suffocating
her. The body was later burned beyond recognition.
The court heard that Mullen had told police of his ''urges to harm
people, mainly women'' which he had kept under control, but there was no
record of Mullen seeking psychiatric help at Peterhead.
It heard that for some weeks before Mrs Wilson's killing, Mullen had
shown particular interest in the movement of young women around the
station, but this was never reported to police.

A LEADING immigration consultant yesterday criticised the Home Office
after a Malaysian client was held at the weekend following a raid on his
Glasgow home.
He will go to the High Court in Edinburgh tomorrow to press for his
release.
Mr Leong Keat Wong, 26, and flatmate Elaine Beh, 23, were taken from
their Hill Street flat by investigators for questioning at a police
station. They were each served with a notice of intention to deport, and
Mr Wong was detained in Greenock's Gateside Prison.
The consultant, Mr Jack Plancey, is angry at what he regards as the
Home Office's heavy handed approach and will ask the High Court to
release Mr Wong on bail to await the outcome of a review.
''Both of these people admit they are living in the UK without
permission and I have been handling their cases for two years. They have
each applied to be allowed to stay here,'' he said.
''They have done everything by the book. They came to ask me to
represent them and we are currently waiting to hear from the Home Office
after I made appeals on their behalf.''
They had been in full time employment at the New City Palace Chinese
Restaurant in Sauchiehall Street, where Mr Wong is a chef and Ms Beh
works as a waitress.
Mr Plancey added: ''They both pay tax and national insurance. Neither
is taking a job away from a UK citizen.''
He is also angry that his clients were taken from their home by
immigration officials using intelligence gathered at a hearing into
another case.

A MINISTER has warned her congregation that their church faces
dissolution due to splits among office-bearers and its financial crisis.
In a letter to the congregation of St Mary's United Free Church in
Moffat, Dumfries-shire, the Rev Ella Pennington said: ''Never has St
Mary's or its minister, or its session, so needed your prayers -- and a
miracle.''
Warning of ''the increasingly distressing financial and spiritual
state'' of St Mary's, Mrs Pennington added: ''The eagerness of a section
of the Deacons' Court to terminate the minister's appointment would no
doubt give rise to the latest rumour that I have been booted out.''
In her letter, Mrs Pennington also said that the church's financial
situation was at a critical point when the deacons met in April, and a
senior elder had proposed that the minister's stipend be cancelled and
any income used for paying for gas, electricity, and insurance only.
Members of the United Free Church's Glasgow Presbytery visited St
Mary's ''to find out if there was any real will at all to see a future
for St Mary's'', said Mrs Pennington.
''They concluded that there was such a division among the
office-bearers, such inability to pull together for the general
well-bring of a Christian church, that there seemed no way forward and
dissolution a strong possibility,'' she told the congregation.
The presbytery's representatives had emphasised repeatedly that
finance alone was not the reason for the church's uncertain future, and
that any last hope would require a session united and sincere in their
aim to encourage and support both church and ministry, said Mrs
Pennington.
''Your session was unable to give this assurance to presbytery's
representatives and so they returned to Glasgow with heavy hearts to
consider their recommendation. The process now appears to be out of our
hands,'' she added.
The minister said that, at the May meeting of the Deacons' Court, one
office-bearer had suggested that the church be returned to those who ran
it before her appointment.
''According to some of our office-bearers, the fault for our failure
appears to be entirely mine. However, this follows the pattern cited in
the church minute book that the last two full-time ministers were also
blamed wholly by the session and Deacons' Court for St Mary's previous
crises -- so everything changes and nothing changes,'' she wrote.
St Mary's session clerk, Mrs Mavis Lane, said Mrs Pennington was ''a
very dedicated minister''. She added: She has a real vocation but some
people want to run the church as their own club without a minister.''
The Rev Douglas Scrimgeour, Clerk to the Presbytery of Glasgow and the
West, said last night that the presbytery had already discussed a report
on St Mary's and had passed the matter over to the Ministry and Home
Affairs Committee of the General Assembly, which is the committee that
finances Mrs Pennington's appointment.
He said: ''Members of that committee have to really investigate the
situation and decide how they can respond. It is really in their hands,
and in a sense the whole thing is sub judice.''
He said that he did not really see dissolution as ''a live
possibility'' at St Mary's.
''Who knows what the future holds in any situation of that kind. It
has to be said that the congregation existed for some time without a
minister. One could simply return to that situation,'' said Mr
Scringeour.
''At the end of the day it is a heavily subsidised congregation, so
much depends on what the financial situation would be. These are all
things that the committee has to look at,'' he added.
Mr Scrimgeour said that normally, dissolution had taken place at the
instigation of the congregation.
It is understood that the dissolution of any church would have to be
ratified by the Church's General Assembly.
Mrs Pennington is currently on holiday and yesterday's service was
taken by another minister.
She refused to give any further details of the church's crisis. ''This
is a private matter for the church. I am aghast that my letter has been
made public,'' she said.
St Mary's has a roll of 64 including 10 deacons and eight members of
the kirk session.

IT was a script the BBC would surely have rejected as too incredible.
The scene: driving rain in the hills of Harris. Enter two bedraggled
campers.
They are wet and exhausted. Their weekend adventure has turned to
drama with their tent blown down and their fate left to the elements.
Our campers spot a Union Flag, flying proudly, defying the storm. It
leads them to a moorland lodge. A gentleman emerges and ushers them in.
His accent suggests he is not local. Perhaps he is a former Home
Secretary?
Unlikely, but possible. The stuff radio plays are made of.
The former Home Secretary, let us call him Kenneth Baker, knows how to
revive wet and exhausted adventurers. He produces cans of beer.
Freelance BBC radio presenter Innes Munro, 24, and his companion, fish
processor Ian Macleod, 22, express deep gratitude. Mr Baker will not
hear of it. Least I could do, he says, particularly since he is awaiting
the arrival of a chum, John Birt, otherwise known as director-general of
the BBC.
Mr Munro said yesterday: ''We were trying to make our way back to the
road. Suddenly, by Loch Scourst, we saw this Union Jack flying from this
wee cottage-type building. Then this man came out towards us and asked
us if we were alright. I did think he was vaguely familiar.''
As they sat with the man's companions, they asked them who he was. Mr
Munro added: ''This nice woman (Mrs Birt, for it was she) said 'That's
Kenneth Baker, of course. We're waiting for my husband, John. You may
have heard of him at the BBC -- he's the director-general'.''
Mrs Birt said they were out at the lodge ''to celebrate a friend's
60th birthday''.
The adventurers were asked to wait until Mr Birt arrived, but Mr Munro
was too embarrassed and said they had recovered to continue the few
miles to the Hushinish road.
He added: ''He is the big boss at the Beeb, after all. And I hadn't
even shaved.''

A FULL report is being made to the Lord Advocate today after a
nine-year-old boy was dragged kicking and screaming from his father's
home by sheriff officers acting on a custody order.
The harrowing scenes were shown to television viewers across the
country and led to a flood of protest calls to BBC Scotland about the
way the hand-over was carried out.
''I have asked for full details of the case,'' said Aberdeen MP
Raymond Robertson.
''The father is one of my constituents and I have talked at length to
him. I will be presenting a report to the Lord Advocate on Monday
morning.''
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had refused to leave
his father when his mother was awarded interim custody.
On Friday, the boy's father and his 15-year-old brother could only
stand and watch as the boy was lifted by two sheriff officers into a
waiting car and driven away.
The officers were carrying out a court ruling that the boy should be
handed over to his mother by a 4.30pm deadline pending a full custody
hearing in three weeks.
He was taken to an interim address in Aberdeen before going on to his
45-year-old mother's house outside the city.
The boy's father said: ''The two sheriff officers just came in and
lifted him and took him away for delivery like a package.
''They grabbed him by the legs and took him, kicking and screaming,
outside.
''I think he is being held against his will and may run away.''
However, the boy's aunt claimed: ''He is perfectly happy. He would
have been programmed to kick and scream like that by his father.
''Now that he is with his mother it is different.''

<HEADLINE>Street claims unsafe verdict on break-ins. Residents of Nithsdale Road dispute insurance company's 'fourth worst area' tag.</HEADLINE>

CLAIMS that a Glasgow street is the fourth worst for break-ins in the
United Kingdom have been denied by residents.
Meanwhile, people living in a suburban street in Aberdeen reacted with
equal surprise at the news that it is regarded as the safest in the
country.
A Lancaster-based insurance company has drawn up a league table of the
riskiest streets to insure in the country, putting a stretch of
Nithsdale Road, Pollokshields, on Glasgow's south side, fourth from the
top.
The firm, Prospero Direct, uses a new risk-rating system to calculate
insurance payments. Traditional systems are based on the first four
digits of a postcode, but Prospero uses all six digits, enabling a far
more detailed analysis of the householder's area. That means a wide
range of premiums can be set -- from less than #100 to more than #1000.
Streets with a bad record of thefts or break-ins can expect a hike in
payments.
Residents in both the Glasgow and Aberdeen streets were surprised that
their ''normal'' areas had been picked out for special attention.
People who live in the stretch of Nithsdale Road between Pollokshaws
Road and Darnley Road defended the area.
Mr Robert Cameron, 56, has lived in the street for 30 years and pays
#150 contents insurance a year. He said: ''In all the time I have been
here there have hardly been any problems. It is crazy to say this is the
fourth worst street in the country -- someone must have got their facts
wrong, because there is no way that is true.''
He said there had been isolated incidents of shop windows in the
street being smashed over the past year.
A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said a thief had tried to
break into her flat three years ago in with a crowbar. ''But the dog
upstairs heard the noise and started barking. When my neighbour started
coming down the stairs the man ran off.
''Since then an intercom has been installed in the close and there
have been no problems. I know that contents insurance is sky-high in
Pollokshields as a whole, but I find it hard to believe it would cost
any more here -- it's just a normal street.''
The woman, who pays about #300 insurance a year, said that her
payments had soared in the last couple of years.
Another resident,Ms Mary Cooper, 82, said: ''I like this place because
I've got nice neighbours -- and that's what makes a place for me.''
Prospero Direct also said that Newburgh Road, Bridge of Don, topped
the list of the safest streets in the UK. The company said it would cost
just #80 to insure a three-bedroomed house in the street.
Resident Gladys Andrew, 52, said: ''I am rather taken aback by it. I
have never heard of any crime being committed right enough, but I did
not expect it to be such a safe street. There is so much crime nowadays
that I didn't think any street would be safe.''
The community nurse, who has lived in the house since it was built in
1979, said security in the houses was good.
She said: ''I can only put it down to the good locks on the windows in
these houses and the general quiet nature of the street. There is no
Neighbourhood Watch scheme or anything like that, and people tend to
keep themselves to themselves.''
A few doors along the street the word from Gary and Silvia Duncan is
along the same lines. Mr Duncan, 34, an electromechanical technician,
said: ''Our insurance premium is pretty much average. But I suppose it
is quite a quiet street.''
Mrs Duncan, 35, a scientific officer, said: ''It is a pleasant place
to live, but I am surprised it is so safe.''
Other insurance companies may introduce the six-digit risk-rating
system.

<HEADLINE>Business centre opens on Bute</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A BUSINESS centre will be opened on Bute today. The #240,000 facility
in Rothesay is part of a major project by Argyll and the Islands
Enterprise to regenerate the island's economy.
According to AIE, the centre was needed to stimulate business
start-ups and provide accommodation for firms.
Created out of a derelict amusement arcade, the 3000sq ft seafront
development is split into offices with central reception services. There
are also meeting rooms available for hire.
The building will house AIE's island project team, Careers Service,
and the CESAR Scotland training and development scheme.
Mr David Roberts, AIE's Bute project director, said: ''This centre
will help meet an urgent demand from businesses for accommodation. The
size of offices for rent and the availability of central services should
also encourage new start-ups.
''This redevelopment also greatly improves the appearance of
Rothesay's waterfront and the overal enhancement of the town, one of our
key priorities.''
The investment represents part of a #1.8m spending project on property
and environmental renewal projects on the island.
Bute has been given top priority by AIE after its successful
regeneration of the Cowal peninsula. More than #8m is to be spent on the
island over the next few years to encourage new industries and expand
tourism and leisure activities.

<HEADLINE>Double trouble for Tories with a possible wigging for Sir Jerry and onslaught on Major. Pressure grows over Gas Bill MP</HEADLINE>

A NEW sleaze row is threatened for the Tories today over the ''cash
for amendments'' case involving senior Tory MP, Sir Jerry Wiggin, if he
is spared full disciplinary action.
There were reports yesterday that the Speaker of the Commons did not
intend to refer the issue to a Commons committee for investigation.
Miss Betty Boothroyd will have a private meeting with Sir Jerry at the
Commons this morning, and he is then expected to make a personal
statement to his fellow MPs about allegations that he tabled amendments,
in which he had a financial interest, to the Gas Bill in the name of
another MP without telling him.
If the Speaker indicates beforehand that Sir Jerry's statement is the
end of the matter, angry reaction can be expected not only from
Opposition but from some Conservative MPs.
It was regarded by most of them as virtually certain that Miss
Boothroyd would refer the issue either to the Commons senior Committee
of Privileges or at least to the Committee on Members' Interests.
Sir Jerry, a former junior Minister, has already admitted in
interviews that he avoided using his own name because it might have been
''misinterpreted'' given his position as a paid consultant to the
British Holiday and Home Parks Association which wants the bureaucratic
delays in supplying gas to mobile homes reduced. The amendment was
tabled in the name of Mr Sebastian Coe.
The Speaker clearly feels that Sir Jerry, who was out of the country
visiting South Africa with the Commons Agriculture Select Committee of
which he is chairman, when his actions were reported, should have an
opportunity to put his case to MPs.
Few MPs would dispute that, but any suggestion an investigation into
the ethics of his action should be dropped will be greeted with anger
and dismay.
There was no guidance from the Speaker's office in advance of her
statement but there were suggestions in Whitehall she was concerned the
Commons committees might split on party lines: it was suggested she
thought this would not be good for the reputation of Parliament.
On the other hand, Conservative Party sources express doubts that the
matter could be so easily disposed of.
Both Government and Opposition are threatening to go it alone on a
clean-up campaign if they cannot agree on the way it should be done. Mr
Major has let it be known that he would be prepared to see a special
Commons committee to consider the Nolan recommendations composed of only
Tories if Opposition parties boycotted it.
Some Conservative MPs argue with support from individual Nolan
Committee members that the report was always intended to be presented to
the Commons for them to decide whether all or some of it should be
implemented and how.
The Opposition argues that such a committee could be a device to delay
implementing the more controversial recommendations during the life of
this parliament.
The Shadow Cabinet is considering a plan to drive Conservative
divisions into the open on Wednesday by tabling a motion for debate
which focuses on the two Nolan recommendations most strongly opposed by
some Tory MPs: the requirement of disclosure of earnings from
consultancies and the appointment of a parliamentary commission to
police the new rules.
Mr Tony Blair wrote to Mr Major at the weekend asking if the proposed
Commons committee would be discussing how to implement Nolan or whether
the report should be implemented at all.
If the latter is the case, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are likely
to refuse to serve.

THE Prime Minister was reported to be ''furious'' about sweeping
criticism of his performance by Baroness Thatcher in advance reports of
the second volume of her memoirs.
With his handling of the Commons sleaze issue now under fire from many
Tory back benchers and the prospect looming of a clash with the Lords on
applying the Nolan recommendations to them, the Thatcher strictures come
at a bad time.
Lady Thatcher attacks what Mr Major regards as his European
achievement at the Maastricht summit and makes a damning reference to
his Government ''lacking a sense of purpose''.
Her criticisms could make some of her admirers, uncertain what to do
about the party leadership, keener to unseat him in a leadership
election in the autumn.
Mr Major's supporters fought back fiercely with public criticism of
Lady Thatcher's own contribution to Euro-dominance by pointing to her
responsibility for the passing of the Single European Act and privately
by suggesting that her Government was never as radical as her rhetoric.
Lady Thatcher, whose memoirs of the earlier stage of her career will
be serialised next week, reportedly states that she never expected her
successor to follow the ''compromise, sweep it under the carpet'' line
on Europe that she had criticised Labour for taking.
She considers ''flawed'' Mr Major's concept of putting Britain ''at
the heart of Europe'' and reproaches him for heightening the impact of
the recession in Britain by taking the UK into the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism at an unrealistic rate.
She describes Maastricht as ''a treaty too far'', and calls on Mr
Major at next year's Euro Summit to reclaim the supremacy of Parliament
over EC law even if that means Britain's partners going on to ''an ever
closer Union'' without the UK.
Sources close to Mr Major said that the Thatcher criticisms failed to
take into account the legacy she left him: a party split over Europe and
a deep recession.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, said on BBC TV's
On The Record that in the mid-eighties the Thatcher Government got its
monetary policies wrong by relaxing pressure on inflation for too long.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Conservative MP for Watford, a former
Government Whip and Foreign Office Minister, said: ''It is tempting for
a former Prime Minister to intervene and discuss a successor's policies.
On balance it is an unwise thing to do.''
He said Mr Major had had to try to curb the boost given to European
federalists by the passing of the Single European Act.
On another Thatcher criticism, that welfare State spending was getting
out of hand, he said Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley was taking
action to curb this ''but the idea that you can cut a swathe through
welfare spending is a view more easily stated from the House of Lords
than from Downing Street''.
Welsh Secretary John Redwood, a Thatcher admirer, told BBC radio's
World This Weekend that the Thatcher Government had bequeathed solid
foundations on which the Major Government was building.
He said Ministers intended to reduce the proportion of national wealth
taken by the Government -- still about what it was when Mrs Thatcher
came to power in 1979 -- ''as prosperity and economic growth advance
over the years''.
Lady Thatcher's observations were welcomed by Tory MPs on the right.
Mr John Carlile said the Prime Minister ''must listen to what is being
said by her and by colleagues in parliament''. Mr Bill Cash said Mrs
Thatcher had given a very clear message which reinforced the views of
Euro-sceptics in the Commons who had consistently been right over the
last few years.
Euro-sceptical Ministers are expected to protest on Thursday.

THE centre-left government of Jean-Luc Dehaene looked set to retain
its majority after Belgium's General Election yesterday, according to
predictions based on early results.
Extrapolations of these results showed that the four-party coalition
of Christian Democrats and Socialists would win about 80 seats in the
reduced 150-seat lower house, compared with 120 out of 212 in the
current chamber.
These also indicated the far-right anti-immigrant Vlaams Blok had not
made the predicted sweeping gains.
''I'm happy to say there has not been a negative vote, but a positive
vote,'' Mr Dehaene said. He will meet King Albert today, after which
coalition talks would start.
Mr Philipe Busquin, Socialist Party leader, said the negotiations
could prove difficult.
