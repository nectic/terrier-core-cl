A MAN who posed as a priest as he preyed on young girls was ordered yesterday
to be detained in a mental hospital.
Gary Duff, of Deans South, Livingston, often wore a home-made ``dog collar'' as
he prowled children's playgrounds and the streets.
Defence solicitor Jim Kelly told Linlithgow Sheriff Court: ``He believed the
girls forced him to do it.''
Duff, 22, who is deaf, has spent the last five months in various hospitals and
prisons.
He admitted three charges of lewd and libidinous behaviour last year.
His victims were young girls aged six, seven, and nine. He picked them up to
kiss and molest them.

<HEADLINE>Accident at fire was avoidable, says chief</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FIREFIGHTER who lost a foot while tackling a blaze in an operating grain
dryer was ``out of line'', his chief officer told a court yesterday.
Grampian firemaster Sandy Lobban said the accident had been avoidable and that
there had been no need for the part-time firefighter to have entered the dryer.
``It should never have happened in the first place. There was no need for the
machinery to be on,'' said Mr Lobban.
He was giving evidence on the second day of a trial at Peterhead Sheriff Court,
where Grampian Regional Council faces a charge under the health and safety
legislation.
Leading firefighter Francis Paterson, 40, of Copeman Place, Peterhead, lost his
right foot when he slipped after trying to clear grain from the inside of the
functioning dryer.
The accident happened on August 1 this year when the retained unit from
Peterhead was called to the fire at Eastlonghill Farm, near the town.
In what is being described as a test case, the council, which is ultimately
responsible for the region's fire brigade, denies failing to provide adequate
training for fighting fires in grain dryers and not preventing Mr Paterson from
entering the dryer when it was working.
``Mr Paterson was out of line ever considering entering the dryer in the first
place,'' said Mr Lobban. ``I would have thought that in particular his
experience would have covered him from that.
``I was extremely surprised and very disappointed to hear about the accident.''
Mr Lobban said it was a golden rule within the service to isolate power at its
source immediately on arrival at a fire. ``It is to ensure there is no chance
of it starting moving when a crew is present,'' he explained.
Mr Paterson, a former slater, is now a temporary training officer with
Peterhead fire station.
The trial, before Sheriff Kieran McLernan, was adjourned until January 4 for
closing submissions.

THIS week, Norrie Williamson called a meeting of athletes in Edinburgh - the
logical first step for the city's development officer for the sport. He wanted
to hear competitors' views, and put their interests at the centre of the
capital's plans to turn the tide of stagnation.
Yet until recently, in his previous job, such a meeting could not have taken
place, for it would have constituted an illegal gathering.
In Durban he was one of 20 whites among a university staff of nearly 500,
teaching 7000 students, 99% of whom were black or Indian. He helped unify five
different sports associations in several sports at regional and national level,
becoming adept at navigating a political jungle of such complexity that he
might even survive in Edinburgh.
The capital should be the focus of athletics in Scotland. It had everything
going for it after the 1970 Commonwealth Games, most notably an all-weather
track and the country's only arena worthy of the name. True, the main clubs,
Edinburgh Athletic Club and Edinburgh Southern Harriers, flourished briefly in
the British league, but real development was neglected.
Edinburgh's athletics has at least one thing in common with South Africa - it
has been bedevilled by factions with limited prospect of finding common ground.
But just as the forces of light triumphed in South Africa, so Williamson may be
the man to change Edinburgh's fortunes, though he stresses that it is no part
of his remit to pursue club amalgamation.
A former Royal High School pupil, he left these shores in 1981 with a degree in
structural and civil engineering and little interest in athletics. Rugby was
his game. He had played hooker for the FP first XV for several years, for
Panmure, and Howe of Fife, and at junior district level with North and Midlands.
When he left, he weighed 13 stones, but he discovered ultra-distance running,
and his racing and training mileage in the interim - the equivalent of more
than twice round the world - had reduced him to less than nine stones by the
time he returned last month.
In the intervening years, he has dominated the South African endurance scene,
during the years of sporting isolation, eventually representing Scotland and
Britain, and winning innumerable medals in events at 100 kilometres, 100 miles,
250k, 24 hours, and even 1000k. He set a record between Johannesburg and Durban
(5 days, 11hr 27min) and when trust funds were introduced in 1983, to the envy
of the track brigade, he had the biggest in South Africa. Victory in one 1000k
(625 miles) event alone brought nearly #5000.
He raced the London and Boston marathons on successive days in 2-42 and 2-45,
took team medals with Scotland in the Commonwealth 100k championships, and has
competed in international triathlons, including the Hawaii Ironman, and to a
high level in cycling, canoeing, and modern biathlon.
He found time to become a qualified coach, international team manager, IAAF
course measurer, broadcaster, commentator, and author of three athletics
coaching books, including the first translated into Zulu.
Sport's role in combating apartheid is perhaps not fully understood, as he
explained: ``With meetings - except sport - of more than 10 people being
illegal, student sport fixtures were the cover. Five hundred `supporters' would
travel to plan the next step. Sometimes their biggest problem was putting two
teams on the pitch to maintain the charade.''
Some whites shunned and reviled him, but for a man used to Scottish concepts of
equality, there was only one path to follow. His contribution to the
democratisation of sport in KwaZulu is unlikely to be forgotten.
A copy of Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Road to Freedom, which was his
parting gift, is signed by dozens of colleagues of every colour and creed,
ranging from national sports leaders to one of the cast of the classic film,
Cry the Beloved Country.
Shortly, he will be joined by his wife, Karin, and steps to develop athletics
in Edinburgh will begin in earnest, from the old clubrooms of Meadowbank
Thistle. The next move is an introductory meeting on Wednesday (7.30pm at
Meadowbank) of stakeholders in the new plan - representatives of the Scottish
Sports Council, Scottish Athletic Federation, District Council, local clubs,
athletes and coaches. All are welcome.
It's a while since he used his engineering degree, but Williamson still builds
bridges.

BUT for the scourge of the swastika, Werner Kissling might have been buried
amid the pomp and pageantry usually accorded to a Prussian diplomat. As it
turned out, Kissling died penniless in a public-sector old folk's home in
Dumfries, and it was two years after his death that #500 was raised to finance
a simple granite headstone above his pauper's grave, a stone's throw from that
of Robert Burns.
Kissling, who might have become German ambassador had Hitler been liquidated,
died aged 92 in 1988; a documentary on his life will be screened by the BBC
next year.
He spent the last 20 years of his life in Dumfries, from where he toured the
country in a battered old van. Little did many people know that this
distinguished-looking man, who captured vanishing Scottish crafts and
traditions on film with his pre-war Leica camera, had played a part in the
history of the Third Reich.
Trundling around Scotland in a jalopy taking photos of crofters and weavers,
however, is a world away from the Weimar republic, in which he had been an
influential man.
As assistant to Gustav Stresemann, the German Chancellor, Kissling, had ordered
Hitler's arrest after the abortive Munich beer-hall putsch on May Day, 1923.
Born into an aristocratic family of landowners in Silesia, he had served in the
Prussian cavalry and the Imperial Navy during the First World War.
When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Kissling resigned his post as First
Secretary in the German embassy in London and became an anthropologist at the
Museum of Ethnography in Cambridge.
In 1934, fearing that the tentacles of Nazi agents would prove his undoing,
Kissling sailed to Eriskay and South Uist in a borrowed yacht, where he
recorded the lives of Hebridean crofters.
In his capacity as an anthropologist and photographer he later worked from a
lean-to annexe at Dumfries burgh museum, where he charmed students and
visitors, and David Lockwood, who is now the museum curator.
``He considered his research to be a race against time, and he only gave up
when forced by ill-health and crippling arthritis,'' Mr Lockwood wrote in his
obituary.
The School of Scottish Studies in Edinburgh is indebted to Werner Kissling,
whose brother was hanged on a meat hook after the ill-fated plot to assassinate
Hitler in 1944. During one visit to Scotland in the 1930s, Kissling made a
film, which is thought to be the first featuring spoken Gaelic.
Alfred Truckell, ex-curator of Dumfries museum, describes Kissling as ``a
brilliant man whose interests were wide-ranging and of international
importance''.
He says: ``He took some magnificent photographs, one of which I thought was
sheer brilliance. It was of the advance of the Red Army over the bridge at Riga.
``He made a splendid film on the Maoris of New Zealand, and he spent three
months in a black house getting an insight into crofting life.''
Kissling bought the Kings Arms Hotel in Melrose, but his brilliance did not
extend to hotel management. He later moved to Dumfries.
All that is left to remind Dumfries folk of the silver-haired gentleman with
the beat-up van and the tranquil demeanour is his headstone in the town's St
Michael's kirkyard. On that memorial are inscribed the words, ``Soldier,
Diplomat, Scholar, Gentleman''.
Ralph Coleman, a librarian in Dumfries, who organised the public subscription
for the stone, comments: ``The epitaph is fitting. That's what he was; an
amazing man with a depth of perception which allowed him to see what Nazism
meant to Europe.
``He once told me that Hitler's henchmen came to the Reichstag to meet
Stresemann, but Werner kept them waiting for ages and then they were refused
entry.
``After Werner resigned, Hitler rang to tell him his regiment needed him.
Werner told him that his regiment no longer existed.
``Hitler told him that he was a traitor to Germany, but he replied he might be
a traitor to Hitler, but not to his country.
``Werner actually told me he had never married because a diplomat was married
to his country. He was hunted by the Gestapo in Britain and he had to get
friends to rescue him from the situation.''
The BBC commissioned a documentary on Werner Kissling from Argyll-based Eala
Bhan. Michael Russell, chief executive of the Scottish National Party produced
the film, which was launched publicly in Dumfries yesterday.

A LONG time ago asylum was something which people sought in a church when they
were on the run. The church provided a safe haven. Then asylum came to mean a
madhouse, until we adopted more enlightened ways of treating mental illness.
Today asylum has reverted to something of its original meaning - a safe haven
in another country sought by those who are fleeing from persecution in their
own country. However, after the actions of some churchmen last week over the
proposed changes in Britain's asylum procedure, I am convinced the church is
now the madhouse.
First some facts. Britain has one of the most generous benefit systems towards
asylum seekers in Europe. The proof of this are the applicants themselves, who
are streaming here in ever-increasing numbers - up from 22,000 in 1993 to an
estimated 40,000 this year. Meanwhile Western Europe's total has dropped from
500,000 to 320,000. To cope with the upsurge in applications to Britain the
Government intends to spend #37 million in the next three years on extra asylum
caseworkers and adjudicators. Hardly the stuff of a heartless state, is it?
Now the nitty gritty fact - how many are actually genuine cases for asylum and
how many are people who simply want a better opportunity in life? The answer is
that 4% are deemed to be genuine refugees by the Home Office and a mere 4% of
appeals are upheld by independent adjudicators. That leaves well over 90% which
are not genuine cases of asylum. This figure does not surprise me at all, and I
do not blame the asylum seekers for trying to win the bread ticket which is
held out by our liberal system. Neither do I blame the Government for trying to
bring some realistic accounting to the whole process.
However, some churchmen are making the issue an excuse for some cheap
campaigning at the expense of the facts, and an excuse for indulging themselves
as the champion of the exploited. They are clever men, and they are succeeding
in muddying the waters by distortion and throwing mud at the Government to
distract attention from the 90% of cases which prove them wrong.
Earlier this week, the Kirk's Church &amp; Nation Convener, Rev Andrew McLellan,
claimed on this page that the new legislation would ``treat all asylum seekers
as if they were here illegally''. That is simply not so. The Home Secretary
will have the power (subject to parliament) to declare that certain countries
are not prone to persecution but those arriving from them will still have the
right to present evidence in rebuttal. What is wrong with that? It is a well
documented fact that some claims of persecution are without foundation, and
anything which helps speed up the assessment process is to be welcomed.
Next up with a letter was the ecumenical machinator, Rev Maxwell Craig (and
former C.&amp;.N man) with his claim that ``from any point of view the changes to
be enacted are draconian''. What nonsense! As long as people claim asylum on
arrival in Britain they will still be eligible for benefit and they will remain
entitled to housing at the taxpayers' expense (but this will be restricted to
public sector housing). What is wrong about insisting that claims be made on
entry? People do not suddenly wake up in the middle of the night after several
months and find they would be unsafe back in their country of origin. They
usually do so after reading the social security benefits to which they might be
entitled.
The third C.&amp;.N man in action this week was the Iona Community Leader, Rev
Norman Shanks who joined the Rev Keith Steven in persuading Glasgow Presbytery
to denounce the Asylum Bill. Keith &amp; Norm's double act was remarkable for the
fact that they totally misprepresented the Bill's proposals. They bypassed the
Prebytery committee reports by raising their biased version of the issue from
the floor with no prior notice. Faced with their version of homeless,
persecuted people being flung out on the street, no other person spoke, and
their motion carried. I just hope that no-one imagines it represents an
intelligent appraisal of the issue.
The trouble is that the C.&amp;.N men are clever chaps. They know how to pull the
strings of the church publicity machine. Words like compassion and justice go a
long way in commanding respect when uttered by churchmen, even in today's world
and I am glad about it. But devaluation of that respect is inevitable when the
prophets prefer a partisan, selective version of the facts.
This is not a Christmas story about the goodies (Joseph &amp; family seeking
asylum) versus the callous Government (Herod). It is about clever men
manipulating church opinion over an issue upon which our country need feel no
shame at all. They offer no solutions, no basis upon which immigrants are to be
admitted other than the desire to be in the UK.
I want to see this country enriched by talented immigrants but there must be
selection and there must be limits. Not long ago I stayed overnight at the home
of a foreign couple in London. It was an excellent council flat in a good area.
It emerged in conversation that they were awaiting a decision on their
application for asylum. He worked and she was expecting a baby. That couple
were talented and decent people, but they have more chance of being run down by
a bus here than they do of being persecuted back where they came from. By all
means let us have immigrants like them, but let us not encourage them to make
fraud applications for political or personal asylum.

THE ill-fated Scottish Basketball Cup second-round tie between City of Aberdeen
Leopards and Glasgow Brightsiders, due to be played in Aberdeen today, is off
again, this time because no suitable referee is available.
Part of the problem is the Boroughmuir Invitation Tournament in Edinburgh,
which has attracted many of the top officials. Ironically, Brightsiders
withdrew from that event in order to fulfil their cup commitment.
The cup-tie should have been played last month. Then it was scheduled for
December 2, but a dispute over tip-off times led to its being rearranged for
today. Now it looks like being delayed until after the new year.

THE general manager of a Scottish health board was at the centre of a political
row last night after Labour called for an urgent investigation into its
management style.
The call followed the resignation of Professor Richard Olver as vice-chairman
of Tayside Health Board.
Friends of the professor said he had been frustrated by the conduct of the
board's general manager, Miss Leslie Barrie.
Now Scottish Labour health spokesman John McAllion, MP for Dundee East, has
written to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth asking him to investigate.
The MP's call has support from the local health watchdog, Tayside Health
Council, which yesterday demanded an urgent investigation into the running of
the health board.
Professor Olver, who works as a paediatrician at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee,
explained that he was left in an ``impossible'' position as the board moved
resources away from hospitals and into more community-based health projects.
He also accused senior health managers of creating a ``them and us'' attitude
between health board purchasers and the trusts that delivered services, which
he said was a ``destructive waste of energy''.
Miss Barrie was in a meeting yesterday and was not available for comment. A
Tayside Health Board spokesman declined to comment.
Mrs Ruth Leslie-Melville, vice-chairman of Tayside Health Council, added:
``Professor Olver's resignation was, for us, confirmation what we had been
worrying about for some time. We feel that there is too great a gap between
what is happening at grass-roots level and at board level.''

PANIC began to set into Scottish football yesterday after the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg ruled the transfer system illegal. The judgment, which
vindicated the stance of the long-suffering Belgian player, Jean-Marc Bosman,
who took his case to Europe's highest court, could have far-reaching
implications for the sport which no longer is free to buy and sell players when
they are out of contract.
For instance, Cowdenbeath warned they could be forced to switch to amateur
status, while others like Hamilton and St Mirren questioned the merits of
continuing with youth development schemes.
However, not everyone was fearful of the consequences. The judgment also
outlaws the system which prevents clubs from fielding only three non-nationals
in European club competitions, and while there was talk yesterday of a
five-year phasing in period, Rangers will be pushing for the immediate removal
of the three plus two (assimilated players) ruling.
The Ibrox club have championed the removal of the non-national rule within
football and were of the belief yesterday that, next season, they will be able
to select their players on merit rather than by observing UEFA restrictions in
which ever European competition they may find themselves. ``It seems to me that
if something is judged illegal, then it is precisely that,'' said Rangers'
vice-chairman Donald Findlay.
``We will be contacting both UEFA and the European Commission to find out what
exactly the impact will be, but we will be pushing also for the immediate
application of the judgment as it affects the three non-national rule.''
Of course, UEFA and the various member associations will be determined to do
all they can to slow the effects of the Bosman judgment, which UEFA president
Lennart Johansson attacked, and it would be naive of anyone to believe they are
without cunning.
Johansson and his people were gathering last night in Birmingham where the draw
for the European Championship finals will be held tomorrow afternoon, but no
one was able to say whether the judgment means transfer fees could still be
demanded within Britain. Scottish lawyer David Will, who is a FIFA
vice-president, said: ``The UK is one country from a political point of view
but four in football terms.''
Nevertheless, other than compromise with FIFPRO, the federation of players'
unions throughout world football, there appears little UEFA or anyone else can
do now to have the judgment overturned. Reasoned debate is the only way forward
and if UEFA realise that then a workable system which takes account of European
law and the needs of football can be negotiated.
SFA chief executive Jim Farry stood above the deepening gloom and stated that
the game would survive. ``It will be business as usual,'' he said.``The system
works. I'm not convinced it is broken and it is my belief that life will go
on.''
However, despite the defiant stance, Farry does not underestimate the perils
which could lie ahead if the correct procedures are not followed by
associations, and he disclosed that high-level talks among UEFA and players'
associations have been held. ``There is a contingency plan,'' he added.
Although the Bosman judgment affects the freedom of movement within the
European Union as dealt with in Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome, it should be
pointed out that transfer fees are now illegal only when players are out of
contract.
The relevant part of the judgment states the court has ruled: ``Article 48 of
the Treaty precludes the application of rules laid down by sporting
associations, under which a professional footballer, who is a national of one
member state, may not, on the expiry of his contract with a club, be employed
by a club of another member state unless the latter club has paid to the former
club a transfer, training, or development fee.
``Article 48 of the EEC Treaty precludes the application of rules laid down by
sporting associations under which, in matches in competitions which they
organise, football clubs may field only a limited number of professional
players who are nationals of other member states.''
Although the consensus among administrators last night was that the transfer
system could continue within Scotland and England, the Scottish Professional
Footballers' Association would not tolerate any attempts to perpetuate the
system without consultation with them.
``It is the case that the judgment applies only to players moving across
European Union borders, but it would be a nonsense if we were to have a
situation where a Scottish player could move without a fee to a French club at
the end of his contract here while that same player could not go freely to a
club in England,'' said SPFA secretary Tony Higgins.
q ENGLAND were stripped of an extra UEFA Cup place for 1996-97 by UEFA's
executive committee yesterday over their clubs' attitude to the Intertoto Cup
this summer. They now will have three clubs in the tournament.
q IBROX has failed to gain nomination to host the 1996 European Cup-winners'
Cup final. UEFA awarded the May 8 event to King Baudouin Stadium, Brussels. The
venue for the European Cup final on May 22 is Rome's Olympic Stadium.

TINA JAMES has got her botany in a twist (Weekend Extra, December 9).
The oca is likely to be Tropaeolum tuberosum and belong to the family
Tropaeolaceae or it could be Chinese artichokes (Stachus affinis or
tuberifera), which is a labiate. Both are listed in The Plantfinder.
Nasturtium belong to the cabbage family (Cruciferae), oxalis is from the
wood-sorrel family (Oxalidaceae) and sorrel is from the dock family
(Polygonaceae).
None of these are related.

IT is hard to object to the proposals in the Government's Broadcasting Bill
which allow greater cross-ownership between newspaper groups, television
companies, and radio stations at both national and regional level. After all,
nobody in Scotland will ever forget Roy Thomson's ``licence to print money''.
The increased stake permitted in television companies is welcome, while the
greater the opportunities to diversify into radio that regional and local
newspapers have the better. Such diversification will help ensure a stronger
future for a beleaguered section of the newspaper industry. It is the diversity
of his empire, after all, that has allowed Rupert Murdoch to fund the
cover-price cuts on his newspapers. As the Newspaper Society pointed out
yesterday, the complex criteria governing what local and regional newspapers
may do are hard to understand, and how they are applied will be what really
matters.
All in all, the opportunities the Bill opens up will be good for regional and
local newspapers, both commercially and in terms of news gathering and
dissemination. There is a danger, of course, in such cross-ownership that one
ends up with one medium plugging the contents of the other. Mr Murdoch's papers
already do that shamelessly with Sky's television programmes, and it could
happen elsewhere under other owners. As far as national newspaper groups are
concerned the ownership rules prevent Mr Murdoch's News International or The
Mirror Group from taking more than a 20% stake, which is something to be
grateful for. Where the new rules governing the ownership of ITV companies give
greatest cause for concern is that they could result in an all-out media war,
in which the big independent companies will try to swallow up the little ones.
When Carlton, not one of Britain's better television companies, declares that
it is delighted by the news, it behoves the viewer to beware. The Bill opens
the way for Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications, Lord Horlick's Meridian
Broadcasting, and Granada to plunder the field, although Carlton's ownership of
Central Television does inhibit its scope for predatory action. But in the
harsh free-for-all world which lies ahead, companies like Scottish Television
and Yorkshire-Tyne-Tees could be up for grabs, as the movement in share prices
following the Bill's publication yesterday made clear. One of the great things
about British commercial television, indeed about British television generally,
is its diversity. Small companies like Border, HTV, Ulster, Grampian, and West
Country Television have genuine links with their viewing audience. The
regulatory system, which the Government has spent the past six years
dismantling, is considered by many to have been the reason for the regional
diversity of programmes. The Scottish Office appears to have ensured that there
is some protection against hostile takeovers for the Scottish companies, but
the ending of the two-licence limit in favour
of a 15% audience ceiling is likely to cause problems for all of them.
Grampian's chief executive, Donald Waters, was convinced yesterday that the
Scottish Office had fought the good fight successfully on behalf of companies
like his, but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. If Mr Waters is
wrong, and the Bill opens the way for companies like his to disappear, then the
Scottish Office will stand condemned. Like everyone else affected, he will be
studying the small print with care over the weekend. One thing is certain:
stations like Grampian will not be saved simply because they are popular with
their audiences and have won Bafta awards for their programmes. Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the Heritage Secretary, claimed her proposals would ``liberate
British broadcasters to become world leaders''. What she appears to have in
mind is the creation of companies which can take on the giants of the industry,
Ted Turner's CNN and Rupert Murdoch's News International, on their own terms.
In such a world, there is no place for minnows.

THERE is nothing inevitable about the way the mobile telecommunications
business in the UK makes its money. Despite intense competition, the entire UK
marketplace for this Christmas's number-one fashion accessory has been coralled
down one particular road.
You buy a handset - value #130, say - for as little as #4.99. You may even be
offered free connection to a network. Thereafter the service provider and its
agents make their money on the much higher cost of calls compared with
fixed-wire telephony.
There are alternative roads. In Scandinavia, the same handset might cost you
the equivalent of #500. But the calls are much, much cheaper. The UK formula -
giveaway hardware, high cost tariffs - encourages a lot of churn in mobile
subscriber lists, when they discover how much it can cost to put their new toy
to use. Churn rates of 40% or higher are not uncommon.
Given the nature of the UK market, success seems to depend on breakneck
expansion, fuelled by ever more ``generous'' front-end giveaways. This is not a
business for wimps. Some of the familiar High Street names find it hard to show
a serious profit for all their efforts.
Eddie Prentice and his partner June Houldsworth at Woodend Communications know
all the pitfalls. They've been in the sector virtually from the start. Their
main focus is the business market, which has limited Woodend's exposure to the
High Street promotion war. Their company makes real money.
When Scottish Telecom, the offshoot of ScottishPower, decided to learn about
mobile service provision it bought a 25% stake in Woodend last year, with a
time-limited option to acquire the business outright.
When ScottishTelecom announced last month that it was to become Vodaphone's key
service provider to corporate customers in Scotland, its chief executive Rod
Matthews claimed the Woodend investment ``remains a central part of our
strategy''. If that means exercising the option, it will make Prentice and
Houldsworth seriously well-off.
Eddie Prentice came to telecommunications via accountancy. Having mixed an
economics degree at Glasgow University with Men's Union politics in the era of
Andrew Neil, he had the opportunity to become a tax inspector. Instead he
trained as a CA.
By 30, he was chief accountant of the SUN group of local newspapers, under a
finance director who was only a few years older. That implied a career block
so, two years later, he moved on to the Hamilton-based Russell office equipment
empire, created by entrepreneur Jim Russell, as group          financial
controller of a #20m turnover business.
Russell, which had outlets from Aberdeen to Sussex, had been sold by its
founder to London and Liverpool Trust. When LLT went into receivership, Jim
Russell bought back control of two of the biggest parts. In 1985, alerted by
people in Cellnet to the potential of mobile telecommunications, he set up
Woodend.
When, in 1987, Russell sold the office equipment side to David Murray, in his
pre-Rangers days, Prentice and the Woodend business moved to East Kilbride's
College Milton estate. ``The telecoms industry in Scotland was very fragmented
at the time. It was served by a lot of small businesses and I saw our move as a
chance to become pre-eminent,'' Prentice recalls.
Jim Russell didn't fully share that vision. He had made his pile. By the late
eighties, Prentice says, Woodend was afloat but drifting. Russell was looking
for a buyer. On holiday in France, lying on a beach, he suddenly thought: ``I'm
40. What if we're bought and I have to uproot the family. Why don't I make an
offer?''
He talked to colleagues, formed a team of four and told Russell they were
interested in an MBO. Within six months a deal was done. Many potential funders
rejected it. ``We were looking for #1m basically to buy 5000 subscribers. It
looked like a lot of goodwill and fresh air,'' he says now.
Through Mike Livingstone and Hamish Grossart at EFT, a group of Irish private
investors agreed to come in. ``We were in charge but not in control,'' Prentice
continues. ``The Irish guys had 51%.''
Woodend made #350,000 in its first year's trading after the buy-out. Eventually
Houldsworth and Prentice went to the bank seeking the resources to buy out
their two partners and the Irish investors.
``There were personal guarantees in place. We had had to borrow heavily. If
anything had gone wrong, we would have been in big trouble. But I was confident
in my own mind. By then we were connecting more people in a month than the
business had done in the whole of 1990.''
From there, the Woodend group developed a branded identity in the marketplace,
embraced quality standards through BSI (garnering four separate
accreditations), emphasised its uniqueness as a Scottish-based service
provider, and developed a thriving arm supplying fixed telecom systems which is
now Panasonic's biggest distributor in Scotland and northern England.
``We are the only company other than BT and Mercury which can connect phones
direct into networks,'' says Prentice. On the mobile side there are now eight
shops, from Aberdeen to Birmingham, to give the business a High Street presence.
``Woodend is not a telecoms retailer,'' he says emphatically. ``Our strength is
in serving the business community. Most businesses now regard mobile phones as
an essential tool. Having your staff out of touch for two hours just insn't
acceptable any more.''

Michael Fry witnesses the long climb back over
the Cumbrian mountains as the English forces
scent disarray in the Jacobite camp
KENDAL, December 16 - The Jacobites' retreat to Scotland is turning into a
nightmare. As they retrace the route they took in high spirits only three weeks
ago, they are hampered by discord in their own ranks, by the worst winter in
living memory, by the now open hostility of the English people and by
harassment from the Government's pursuing forces.
Today, the clansmen had great difficulty controlling the situation round this
little town, where they had halted overnight before the long climb back over
the Cumbrian mountains. Even as the first of them set out under Prince Charles
Edward Stuart, townsfolk shouted insults and threw stones. Without their
officers' knowledge, some soldiers retaliated. They are reported to have killed
three civilians and looted several houses.
By the time the rearguard formed up, Kendal's resentment was boiling over. As
the prince's military commander, Lord George Murray, gave the final orders to
move off, a group of snipers organised by the town's parsons opened fire. In
their haste to get out, the clansmen left several horses behind.
They also soon learned that the road in front may not be clear. Murray had sent
ahead a detachment of cavalry under the Duke of Perth. It was to make for
Scotland with all possible speed and round up the available reinforcements, two
regiments from Perthshire raised by Lord Strathallan and the French force of
800 under Lord John Drummond which recently landed at Montrose.
But Perth's party was ambushed at Shap Fell by local militiamen, who at
Carlisle last month had just run away. Called out again under orders from the
Duke of Cumberland, commander of the royal forces in England, this time they
shot up the Jacobites and forced them to turn round.
Progress through the hills is anyway painfully slow. The rearguard has only
heavy wagons for transport over poor roads in torrential rain, with snow and
ice at high levels. Often the clansmen have to manhandle equipment across
rivers and through deep mud, a job so backbreaking that the officers join in.
To hurry things up, Murray proposed abandonment of the heavy baggage and
artillery. But Prince Charles refused, and insisted that not a single
cannonball was to be left behind. Today the balls, which if loaded on a cart
would be impossible to move, are being carried one by one in their plaids by
the soldiers of the Glengarry regiment. Murray has promised to pay each of them
sixpence for the extra effort.
The main body of Highlanders should be able to brush aside any screen of
militiamen at Shap and get across to Penrith. But the crawling rearguard runs
the danger of becoming separated, and of being caught by the English forces now
in pursuit.
While Murray spares no effort to get his army quickly to the Border in one
piece, he is often obstructed by Prince Charles, who has been intent on
stressing that this is a tactical withdrawal, not a flight. As a result, the
Jacobites have lost the three days' lead which they had when they started their
retreat from Derby on December 6.
At Preston, which they reached five days later, the prince halted and called a
council of war. The purpose was to debate a plan put forward by the Duke of
Perth and the Marquis d'Eguilles, French envoy to the Highland army. The pair
proposed that it should go into winter quarters in this town, which it could
use as a defensive base while waiting for the expected reinforcements from
France via Scotland. The clan chieftains rejected the idea out of hand. But by
the time the talking was over scouts had spotted the approach of English
troops. The Highlanders left Preston with only an hour to spare.
On December 13, while they were making for Lancaster, they found they had not
only the Cumberland but also General Wade on their tail. Wade's army is charged
with the defence of the eastern side of England, but has so far had nothing to
do because the Jacobites advanced down the western side, and snow has blocked
his routes over the Pennine Hills. This week he at last managed to get an
advance guard across under Major-general James Oglethorpe, which skirmished
with Lord Elcho's regiment of Jacobite cavalry at Garstang, 10 miles from
Preston.
But the Government in London then suspended all operations when it received
intelligence that the French were at last making moves to invade the South of
England. They have been gathering troops along the Channel for some weeks,
though without till now making any obvious preparations for boarding ship or
putting to sea. This seemed about to happen when the designated leader of the
expedition, the Duc de Richelieu, arrived at Boulogne with Prince Charles's
younger brother, Prince Henry.
Orders were sent to Cumberland to halt his pursuit and turn round. The duke in
turn recalled Oglethorpe, unaware how hard on the Highlanders' heels he was.
Before they could start for the south, it became clear that in fact an invasion
could not be under way, because the French were making no serious attempt to
break the royal navy's blockade in the Channel.
In the North of England, the royal armies then resumed the chase. The Jacobites
had gained a day, and at this stage Prince Charles was still hoping to fight a
battle on English soil and regain the initiative. Once at Lancaster, he sent
out Lord George Murray to select a suitable site. When they saw, however, that
two enemy forces were again closing in, they decided against making a stand.
The clansmen were ordered to move on to Kendal.

Good causes
on the cards
TO send or not to send, that is the question in many people's minds at this
time of year as they examine last year's Christmas card list.
Some, like KPMG, decide not to. It advertised this in The Herald yesterday
under the heading ``What! No Christmas Card?'', explaining that it was not
sending any this year, but instead was making a donation to charity.
Lanarkshire Development Agency took the same decision and is giving #2000 to
good causes instead.
Many companies, however, continue the traditional practice of sending greetings
to their clients, and help charities at the same time by purchasing their cards.
If your company is among this band, and you haven't sent out yours yet, or you
have run out and need to buy more, you might consider the cards produced with
businesses in mind by the Prince &amp; Princess of Wales Hospice in Glasgow's
Carlton Place.
They are priced at 75p each, and we are told a hefty chunk of this goes to the
hospice which recently launched a #1.4m appeal to extend its day and home care
provision. If you are interested in making a purchase, give Jim McFatridge a
call on 0141 429 5599 extn 159.
While on the subject of charities. LDA staff are to be congratulated for their
efforts in raising #3200 from bottle collections, sponsored football matches
and a charity ceilidh. The money will go to seven deserving causes.
Engineering
excellent value
THERE is still a chance for Strathclyde companies to grab themselves a highly
trained engineer for a year at the knockdown price of #7500.
Business Diary readers will recall that several weeks ago we featured the
initiative by Lanarkshire Development Agency and Scottish Design to place
redundant Rolls-Royce engineers in small to medium-sized firms. The engineers
are paid #15,000 but the companies only have to pay 50% of this.
Following our piece more than 20 firms contacted David Robson at Scottish
Design, who is now in the process of placing the engineers, but he tells me it
is not too late for companies to avail themselves of this opportunity by giving
him a call on 0141 221 6121.
Joking apart,
congratulations
THE Women's Technology Centre, which is housed in the Dalmarnock Initiative
Base in Glasgow's East End, held its annual diploma presentation ceremony
yesterday in the city's Merchant's Hall.
Comedian Elaine C Smith made the presentations to the 70 women who took part in
its business start-up course, a year-long technology course, and a training
course for women from the ethnic communities. Well done everyone, and I am told
Smith was in top form.
Course is just
the job for men
STRATHCLYDE Business Development should be congratulated for the cut price deal
it has struck with Babson College in Boston to allow Strathclyde businesses to
participate in its Working for the Yankee Dollar course. The cost has been
reduced to between #700 and #800, about a fifth of the normal price.
Hopefully, the experience of taking part will help reduce the number of MCPs in
the Scottish business community. For Bob Creighton, president of the Scottish
Trade Group, reveals that one of the classic mistakes made by Scots businessmen
trying to break into the North American market is to underestimate the power of
women on company boards.
He explains: ``Many Scottish firms are not prepared for the large number of
powerful women in US firms. We still get incidences of Scots businessmen
talking down to a woman, then finding out they have blown the deal because she
is the president of the company.''
If you would like to find out more about the course, which takes place next
March, contact Harry Baxter or Eileen Anderson at SBD on 0141 227 3874.
Pooling their
resources
SWIMMING pools are keeping Frank Thomas busy these days in and out of business
hours. He is the senior partner of Thomas &amp; Adamson, one of Scotland's leading
firms of quantity surveyors, which is currently completing the modernisation of
the Dollan Baths in East Kilbride and also the upgrading of Glasgow
University's pool.
In his spare time he is a member of STOP (Save The Outdoor Pool) which is
trying to convince East Lothian District Council that the North Berwick outdoor
pool should remain open.
Today Scottish rugby internationalist Scott Hastings and Santa Claus are
joining forces to help the STOP campaign. Hastings will be at North Berwick
pool at 11am to sign autographs and around the same time Santa will be arriving
in a horse-drawn carriage.
It is not surprising Thomas takes a keen interest in this particular pool as he
is a local and also a former swimming champion. He won the Scottish men's
220-yards freestyle championship at the Bon Accord baths in Aberdeen in 1958.
He also coached David Wilkie to his Olympic silver medal, and of the 21 Scots
swimmers who took part in the 1970 Commonwealth Games, ten were his proteges.

ONE man's five-year struggle to prove the injustice and insensitivity of
football's authorities ended yesterday, but, ironically, Jean-Marc Bosman's
persistence could have serious repercussions for footballers throughout Europe.
It never was the Belgian's intention to undermine the sport's system to the
effect that fellow professionals could lose their jobs, but that could be the
scenario, although the effects might not be as devastating as many fear.
When the European Court of Justice ruled yesterday that football's ways of
transferring footballers and restricting movement were illegal, Bosman, denied
the right to earn a living within his chosen sport, was able to celebrate. He
and the players' unions who had backed him were vindicated. They had triumphed
over the might of UEFA, a typically intransigent football body which needed
reminding of its place in the wider world, and as the judgment, said to be 100
pages in detail, is analysed, a black reality begins to emerge.
While all fair-minded people who believe in basic human rights and freedoms
will welcome the judgment, it would be callous, not to say foolish to ignore
the growing fears of the people who have benefited from the game's bartering
system. The possibility of casualties is strong. Some clubs which have enjoyed
professional status for many decades could close, or slip into the anonymity of
the amateur ranks.
Clubs like Rangers and Celtic will thrive on the judgment, which will allow
them to play as many non-Scots as they wish in European competition, and they
may also be able to take the best players from clubs without paying a fee. Of
course, the Old Firm stand to lose players to other, larger clubs, but in
general the effects of the judgment should work in their favour.
Throughout the leagues of Europe the rich will become stronger. It is perverse
irony this will be one of the consequences of Bosman's quest to expose one of
the wrongs in football.
Clubs, especially those like Dundee United who are adept at nurturing young
talent, now must reconsider their work. If they cannot be guaranteed a transfer
fee for a player their expertise, time, and money has produced, there would
seem to be little point in persevering with a serious youth policy. However,
the judgment is open to various interpretations. There are loopholes and ample
room for UEFA's lawyers to manoeuvre, which means arguments will rage before
everyone understands what they can and cannot do.
Nevertheless, that won't prevent the jowls of club chairmen in the traditional
mould from quivering in fear. They believe yesterday's judgment was a death
sentence for some clubs.
Cowdenbeath's chairman, Gordon McDougall, said clubs like his could be driven
to amateur status. ``If the full force of the judgment hits, I can see no
alternative but to turn amateur,'' he said. McDougall claims it costs his
third-division club #10,000 a year to operate a youth programme, but he fears
that if players can walk away at the end of their contracts, there would be no
point in bringing them through in the first place.
``Could I work with a boy for years, coaching him to first-team level and then
he says, `thank you,' and he goes elsewhere without compensation for us?''
asked a bemused St Mirren manager Jimmy Bone. ``Our directors will need to
decide our furture plans.''
Hamilton manager, Iain Munro, also voiced concern about youth development and
suggested the SFA could take on the responsibility. ``It could be laid down
that no-one could sign any of the players until they were 16 and a small fee
would have to be paid,'' he said.
``As the boy advances in to a first team and possibly an international side, an
extra sum could be paid to the SFA.''
It is this kind of thinking which will be required now as football comes to
terms with the implications of the Bosman judgment, but yesterday was a day
when football people were wrapped in paranoia. Eventually, however, sanity will
be restored.
``There must be compensation for clubs which produce players from within their
own ranks,'' said Roy Aitken, whose club, Aberdeen, have a pedigree in rearing
talent. ``There must also be a period of time allowed for clubs who have
invested heavily in players to come to terms with the new system.''
Rangers were happy with the outcome and their vice-chairman, Donald Findlay,
argued that the development of young players would not be slowed because some
clubs might wish to sign more foreign players. The three non-nationals rule
also was deemed illegal, and Findlay said: ``If you have a player like Charlie
Miller, for instance, he would come through in any case.
``It will always make sense for clubs to bring through their own players. For a
club like Rangers the secret will be finding the balance between the real
Rangers players, men reared in the club, and the hired guns.''
Celtic's chairman, Fergus McCann, welcomed the judgment more cautiously. ``I am
glad to see the three-      foreigners rule has changed,'' he said. ``That
brings football in line with other fields of work.
``I would also like to see the 10-player limit on non-EC players widened as it
puts Scottish football at a disadvantage.''
Enough, Fergus. The months ahead are going to be tricky enough trying to
tip-toe through the pages of the court judgment without complicating matters
worrying about non-union citizens. Common sense and reasoning will get everyone
through, and two men who will be called upon to counsel and advise realise also
there is now a need to reach compromise. Tony Higgins, the Scottish
Professional Footballers' Association secretary, and SFA chief executive Jim
Farry will have much to say.
``First we will have to find out what the legal framework is and go from
there,'' said Higgins. ``A long-term view between players and governing bodies
will have to be developed.''
Farry appeared comfortable with the situation, even though he had been hoping
it would all just go away. ``Re-investment in youth is a vital component of our
sport,'' he said. ``The importance of such re-investment should not be
minimised.''
Farry agreed that one aspect of the Bosman ruling could be a reworking of
Scottish football's finances, and that would not necessarily be a bad thing. If
approached properly, the Bosman case could be seen as a blessing for everyone,
but if the wrong decisions are taken, it could, indeed, mean the end for some
clubs.

Citizens' trio
share portrait
A PORTRAIT of the Citizens' Theatre's directorial triumvirate by Glasgow artist
Adrian Wiszniewski was unveiled yesterday at the theatre by Jeremy Isaacs.
The painting - of Giles Havergal, Robert David MacDonald, and Philip Prowse -
was commissioned by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. It will be on
display at the People's Palace in Glasgow for two months before moving to the
Edinburgh gallery.
Chainsaw death
A TREE surgeon bled to death yesterday when a tree trunk he was cutting split,
throwing him to the ground along with his running chainsaw. The unnamed victim,
aged 47, was given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but died within minutes at
Pitts Cleave quarry near Tavistock, Devon.
Tenement listed
A TENEMENT block in Dumbarton has been classed as a historic building. The
65-year-old Overtoun Terrace on Dumbarton's Glasgow Road has received category
C status, which means it is considered to be of local importance. The listing
affords the building protection from demolition, extension, or alteration.
Escapees held
FOUR men appeared in Dumbarton Sheriff Court yesterday accused of escaping from
custody at the same place 24 hours earlier. Eric Gray, 25, John Harrigan, 23,
Kenneth Proctor, 20, and Iain Brown, 20, all of Alexandria, were alleged to
have broken away as they were led to police vans. The four, who were all
recaptured within a few hours, made no plea and were remanded in custody.
Postal pay offer
MORE than 155,000 Royal Mail delivery and sorting staff are being urged by
their unions to accept an inflation-busting pay offer, revealed yesterday,
worth 3.5%.
Radiator recall
THOUSANDS of oil-filled electric radiators are being withdrawn because they
could catch fire or leak dangerous fumes. The Dimplex radiators in question
were sold mainly through B&amp;Q and Norweb stores and were marked with model
numbers: CR1507, CR2009, CR2009T, and BQ15CR.

Frank McGroarty talks
to Bob Monkhouse about
his silent favourites
THROUGHOUT 1995, movie buffs have been treated to a veritable feast of cinema
classics on television as a build-up to the 100th anniversary of the cinema.
The celebrations themselves start on December 28 and when it comes to film
fans, one of the most famous in this country is comedy star Bob Monkhouse.
``I watch a lot of films on video,'' he said, ``but I prefer to go to my local
cinema and see them because that is what they were originally made for.''
Monkhouse is regarded as one of the country's renowned movie buffs and since
the age of 16 has built up a collection of classic films from the industry's
golden era, with the silent films being among his prized possessions.
The host of TV's Celebrity Squares and Memory Masters and On the Spot has his
own batch of movie memories to last him a lifetime. When Monkhouse started to
frequent the local picture houses, the silent-movie era was still fresh in a
lot of people's minds. So it comes as no surprise that he lists Buster Keaton
among his heroes.
``He was a wonderful comedian, a clown and an acrobat,'' he said. ``There was
certainly no-one like him,'' he said. ``A heroine of mine from the silent years
was Mabel Normand who starred in the Mack Sennett comedies. She was a waif-like
creature who was also a great comedienne.'' His love of those old films became
intertwined with his television career when he used his collection of silent
comedies as part of the hit show from the late sixties, Mad Movies. ``There was
talk of me doing a similar series but we are still negotiating.'' Unfortunately
for him it was that collection of films that led to him appearing in the dock
of the Old Bailey on June 6, 1979, where he was charged with conspiring to
illegally import copies of films. The case was thrown out of court but the
story did not completely finish on a happy note. ``I was unable to get all of
my films back. Those that were not returned to me were destroyed, it was very
sad.''
When he was seven years old, it was a trip to a cinema in Sydenham that was to
have a profound effect on Monkhouse and to shape his destiny. ``I was taken to
see Boots Boots, starring George Formby, in 1934,'' he said. ``I was spellbound
in the darkness.''
Over the years he marvelled at the antics of the Marx Brothers. He also became
a fan of Bob Hope while watching the film The Cat and the Canary. Years later
he was to work with the comic legend as one of his scriptwriters.
Monkhouse does not stick to just watching old masterpieces. Whenever he gets a
break from his exhausting schedule he pays regular visits to his local cinema
in Milton Keynes. ``One of the strangest movies I have ever seen has been the
film Ed Wood starring Johnny Depp. That fact that they make such a wonderful
film about a guy who could not make films himself, fascinates me.
``I enjoy watching films such as Quiz Show, made by Robert Redford, and Murder
in the First, starring Christian Slater. I still watch comedy films. I consider
myself to be a student of comedy. There was the film, The Ref, starring Dennis
Leary, that was a really funny movie.''
However not all films he has seen meets with his approval. ``There was a film
starring Shirley MacLaine called Guarding Tess,'' he said. ``Whoever you write
this for, you can tell them that it is a load of old rubbish.''

OVER the years jazzmen have, like most other musical artists, dabbled in
festive season songs and we have been entertained by Fat Waller's irreverent
Jingle Bells and Louis Armstrong's White Christmas and sundry others . . .
Then, a little more than 20 years ago, an entire album named Hark The Herald
Angels Swing was released by The World's Greatest Jazz Band of Yank Lawson and
Bob Haggart. My three daughters grew up listening to it, my non-jazz friends
were absolutely captivated by it and it remains a staple on  my turntable over
the Christmas season.
The band mixed Tin Pan Alley songs along with traditional items and hymns and
the mix was so successful that other groups followed this example.
The Sackville All Stars with Ayrshire's own Jim Galloway on soprano saxophone
brought out their record; another all-star group with yet another Scot,
baritone saxophonist Joe Temperley, had an album on Dreamstreet and even the
pianist Art Hodes drenched Joy To The World with Chicago-based blues figures
Jimmy Yancey would have envied.
Now we have two Christmas CDs on the market to allow us to celebrate the
holidays in jazz mode. One is on Concord and it was issued a year ago and the
other is on Chiaroscuro and has just appeared on the specialist shop listings.
Both feature major stars who have recorded for these labels and, amazingly,
just a single featured artist turns up on both. Pianist Dave McKenna is that
man with a sensitive version of Mel Torme's beautiful Christmas Song on the
Chiaroscuro and an equally respectful reading of O Little Town of Bethlehem on
the other. It's difficult to pick a favourite between the two new issues though
I would lean a little towards the Chiaroscuro. These various recordings began
as a bonus for the label's owner Hank O'Neal. When he recorded the various
musicians he asked for an extra couple of tracks which he then had pressed as
singles and sent them out as Christmas cards to his friends.
The first was the McKenna, the next had the legendary Earl Hines playing White
Christmas which is on the current CD.
However, best of all, are the tracks featuring Flip Phillips and Summit
Reunion. Phillips, the one-time rabble rouser with Jazz At The Phil, still
remembered for his tenor battles with Illinois Jacquet confirms his stature as
a superior ballad player with a track which begins with O Come All Ye Faithful
and then segues into Silent Night for five minutes and fourteen seconds of
bliss.
Summit Reunion, with main protagonists Kenny Davern and Bob Wilber swinging
superbly, perform It Came Upon The Midnight Clear with the usual support from
the rhythm section of Dick Hyman, Milt Hinton, Bucky Pzzarelli and Bobby
Rosengarden.
Among other featured artists on this album are Louie Bellson, Roger Kellaway,
Junior Mance, Ralph Sutton and Jay McShann and the pianist Dick Wellstood with
a joyous recreation of Waller's Jingle Bells enlivened by the presence of
trumpeter Herman Autrey who had been on the original with Fats and hung around
for some 40 years or so to do it all again.
Poor Autrey did have some difficulties with the whole session, though. I
remember Wellstood telling me once that the trumpeter, well into his seventies
by this time, had turned up loaded and was unable to complete all the numbers.
This one, however, must have been done early because that rough-toned trumpet
which was on most of the Waller records sounds unaltered by time.
Concord, more of a major label, has some bigger guns to trot out on their
seasonal offering. Rosemary Clooney is here with Christmas Time Is Here and
pianist Gene Harris plays I'll Be Home For Christmas and tenorist Scott
Hamilton does Christmas Love Song.
But it's one of the lesser-know men musicians from the Concord stable,
guitarist Frank Vignola who steals the show with a bluesy version of Jingle
Bells.
Normally a guitarist who is linked with various Django Reinhardt revivals at
such New York clubs as Michael's Pub, Vignola shows much more than just a
Django influence on this track.
The great thing about all the recordings I have mentioned is that none of them
sound as if they have been done as some sort of gimmick. There is a genuine
warmth about them all.
You'll find out when you listen and, if you can find the WGJB album on World
Jazz then look out for Billy Butterfield's version of Christmas Song - that
beats all the rest!

I HAVE waited with interest to see if the concerns voiced by certain
politicians about the 7!s% cut in the Scottish Enterprise budget would be
matched by a storm of protest from the business community.
I have not been surprised at the lack of reaction.
I am quite sure that a host of businessmen would welcome being given the
challenge of achieving such a reduction. I am equally sure that such a
reduction could be achieved without in any way jeopardising the objectives of
either SE or the LECs.
Could The Herald not invite suggestions for cost reductions to be undertaken by
(or imposed upon) Scottish Enterprise?
I am sure a grateful Mr Forsyth would be pleased to provide some bottles of
House of Commons whisky for the most imaginative suggestions.

<HEADLINE>Rural Scotland Yet more countryside quangos</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>14</PAGE>
<ARTICLETYPE>Leader</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>974864407</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE White Paper on rural Scotland issued yesterday offers a plethora of fine
words and pretty ideas. The Scottish Office will work in partnership to enable
rural Scotland to be prosperous, with a range of job opportunities enabling
natives and newcomers to ``enjoy worthwhile ways of life'', to be vigorous in
its community life, to be culturally confident, cherishing local traditions and
distinctive ways of life - all noble aims. Rural Scotland would also be ``able
to protect, conserve and enhance its outstanding natural environment'' through
this four-pronged policy framework embracing economic, social, cultural, and
environmental aspects. But the bottom line is that it creates yet more
countryside quangos and is vague on resourcing and yet again, we suspect, it
will lump the onus of actually doing anything about poor transport provision,
rural homelessness, lack of job opportunities for the young and other chronic
rural problems on to the new local councils.
The third of the Scottish population classed as rural dwellers usually share
some common aspirations, such as the desire to live in beautiful surroundings
while rearing and educating families away from cities and their drawbacks.
Often the attainment of such goals means sacrifice, accepting a lower level of
economic participation or poorer services, or paying higher prices for
essentials. Many have always been willing to accept these and other minuses to
secure a share of rural Scotland's benefits. There has, however, been a growing
consciousness that change is possible, that rural community living need not
equate for ever with low expectations. It is difficult to pinpoint any single
influence which has triggered this mood but it is possible to see it in the
debate on Harris and Lewis over the super-quarry proposal, the emergence (from
the womb of the Scottish Office) of the community forest concept at Laggan, and
the raid on the market by which the crofters of Assynt took control of their
own land. There are other similar land initiatives on the boil around the
Highlands. Whatever his long-term reasons, Mr Michael Forsyth, the Scottish
Secretary, has now assumed a role in this land reform - belatedly, towards the
end of a long spell of power - and a cynic might say that it reeks of a
last-ditch attempt to win back rural Scotland for the Tories. The same cynic
might add that yesterday's paper does nothing to address key issues, such as
the pressing need for genuine measures backed by real vision in the matter of
preserving our natural heritage. Many of the natural wonders about which the
Scottish Office gushes are already in reality devalued by inappropriate
forestry and inappropriate sporting use. The accelerating slaughter of
Scotland's birds of prey by the lairds, the vast over-proliferation of deer to
provide easy targets for rich foreigners - even the de facto hand-over of Loch
Lomond, one of the jewels in the heritage crown, to speed boaters and water
skiers by the expected promulgation of inadequate by-laws
- are cases in point.
At a time when our Irish neighbours are pumping millions and much thought into
angling tourism as their major rural asset, the Scottish Office seems content
to leave what is potentially one of rural Scotland's most major economic assets
to drift downwards in a policy vacuum dominated by netting interests. The
trumpeting of a commitment to sustainable development is fine; the reality with
which we are all familiar is very different. The White Paper may represent some
kind of vision, but it remains hard to see whence any tangible benefit will
accrue.

Court stop-over
STORNOWAY Airport convened as a court yesterday to remand a man from the Uists
accused of house-breaking, because there was no fiscal or sheriff clerk
available at Lochmaddy. Lewis's sheriff redirected him by plane to Porterfield
Prison, Inverness.
Memorial
FRIENDS remembered the late Labour leader John Smith yesterday, as his widow,
Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill, presented a cheque in Edinburgh for #1000 to the
British Heart Foundation. It was raised by a memorial walk at Loch Katrine
earlier this year.
Meningitis victim
A FIVE-month-old boy has become the latest victim of meningitis. The child,
from Weymouth, Dorset, died hours after being admitted to hospital. The number
of cases of meningitis in Dorset has increased by more than 50% in the past
year.
Lost message
THE Government's Just Say No campaign against drugs has failed, say anti-drugs
campaigners. The Fast Forward Agency says negative images of the consequences
of drug use have served to alienate youngsters. It believes better financial
support for the volunteer agencies would be more effective.

A JURY was told how a young Ayrshire woman died on a new bypass when the car in
which she was a passenger was involved in a head-on collision with an
Automobile Association patrol van.
Ms Alison Dunn, 20, of Arran Place, Ardrossan, was taken to hospital in Paisley
following the accident on the A737 Johnstone By-pass in June, last year.
However, she was already dead from ``catastrophic internal injuries'' to her
head and body.
Mr Bernard Coyle, 58, of Campsie Road, Slaemuir, Port Glasgow, who was an AA
patrolman at the time, denies causing her death by dangerous driving.
The trial at Paisley Sheriff Court was told how the car's driver, Mr Andrew
Allan, 24, of Ardrossan Road, West Kilbride, could do little to avoid a
collision when the accused's van suddenly appeared in front of his vehicle from
a stream of west-bound traffic.
Lorry driver John McLelland, 29, of Kirknowe Cottages, Howwood, Renfrewshire,
said he had been driving his articulated lorry east on the by-pass when the
accused's van suddenly appeared directly behind him.
He saw the van appear close to the rear of his trailer in his offside wing
mirror and it ``caused him some alarm''.
The next thing he knew, the van had pulled out as if to overtake his 40ft truck
and, almost instantaneously, there was an impact with the car.
He told the court: ``The van took off as if it had gone up a ramp. It was
spinning through the air.'' Asked what that ``ramp'' had been, he replied:
``The other car.''
The witness said he later told police he thought the van driver must have
suffered a heart attack or stroke, causing him to lose control of the van.
``That was the only way I could explain the van's actions,'' he added.
Giving evidence, Mr Coyle said that, since the accident, he had been paid off
on medical grounds, due to the injuries he sustained.
He said he had served as a special constable for 23 years and had at times
assisted police in road safety competitions, as he had passed his advanced
driver's test.
He denied that he had driven on the wrong side of the road in the seconds
leading up to the collision and said he had no recollection of driving behind
Mr McLelland's lorry, or that he had tried to overtake any vehicles.
The accused said had been on his way to assist a female member who needed a
wheel changed. It was an urgent call but he had not been driving fast.
He claimed he had seen Mr Allan's car coming towards him on the wrong side of
the road and had tried to take evasive action by swerving to the right onto the
other carriageway, but could not avoid a collision.
Under cross examination, he denied he had been momentarily disorientated before
the accident, or that he had been unwell.
Giving evidence for the defence, another lorry driver, Mr John Davis, 32, from
Erskine, claimed Mr Allan's car had overtaken him just before the two vehicles
collided.
He felt the accident occurred as Mr Allan's car had failed to fully complete
the overtaking manouvre and had clipped the AA van which, he maintained, had
remained on its own side of the road.
The trial, before Sheriff Colin Higgins, is expected to conclude on Monday.

SO the report from the Scottish Office Schools Inspectorate is advocating the
teaching of Scottish Country Dancing in secondary schools.
We in primary schools were away ahead of ourselves 40 years ago when many of us
had the job of preparing P7 for the ``Quali'' dance.
With the help of Jimmy Shand records and an old gramophone I put my class of 51
pupils through their paces - pas de basque, jig, and skip change of step
teaching the Dashing White Sergeant, Gay Gordons, and even attempting the
Eightsome Reel.
My most difficult task was persuading the boys to choose a partner and to hold
her hand. Incidentally the dress in those days was very formal - sticky-out
taffeta dresses and perms were obligatory for the girls, and the boys wore
suits.
Over the years the dances remained the same but the dress of both sexes changed
dramatically. Eventually it was the most outrageous gear available - taffeta
dresses were definitely out and no boy would have been seen dead in a suit.
They say that if you live long enough everything comes back into fashion. Any
day now the Schools Inspectorate will be recommending the chanting of the
multiplication tables and learning by rote.

Shedding light
for charity
TAXI driver Brian Roe and his wife Isobel have spent almost #2000 on Christmas
decorations for their Dumfries council house and garden - and a further #300 on
a video security system to protect the display from vandals, who struck five
times last year.
The outside illuminations are so spectacular they stop the traffic. Inside the
house is like Santa's grotto and will be open to the public each evening next
week, with all donations going to Children in Need.
Triple portrait
A PORTRAIT of the Citizens' Theatre's directorial triumvirate by Glasgow artist
Adrian Wiszniewski was unveiled yesterday at the theatre by Jeremy Isaacs. The
painting - of Giles Havergal, Robert David MacDonald, and Philip Prowse - was
commissioned by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. It will be on display
at the People's Palace in Glasgow for two months before moving to the Edinburgh
gallery.
Disney deal
THE success of Pocahontas could bring more jobs to Grampian Records of Wick,
which produced 150,000 soundtrack tapes from the film. Disney is to discuss
future contracts with the Caithness factory and the possibility of establishing
a European production centre.
Postal pay offer
MORE than 155,000 Royal Mail delivery and sorting staff are being urged by
their unions to accept an inflation-busting pay offer, revealed yesterday,
worth 3.5%.
Radiator recall
THOUSANDS of oil-filled electric radiators are being withdrawn because they
could catch fire or leak dangerous fumes. The Dimplex radiators in question
were sold mainly through B&amp;Q and Norweb stores and were marked with model
numbers: CR1507, CR2009, CR2009T, and BQ15CR.
Man charged
AN unnamed, 30-year-old Aberdeen man appeared in private at the city's Sheriff
Court yesterday on two sex assault charges against women. The accused made no
plea or declaration and was committed for further examination and remanded in
custody.

MARK, the disturbed husband in Fritz Lang's Secret Beyond the Door, says that
``under certain conditions a room can influence what happens in it''. Mark,
like so many film noir actors, has murder on his mind. As children of Cain, the
voyeurs in the audience have also thought of murder - usually the kind of
seductive murders you get in black and white movies.
On my way to the premire of the Fun Film Club, I came close to killing a cab
driver who accused me of looking like Liz Hurley. ``Aren't you that what's her
face?'' he asked, as we waited in a traffic jam on Park Lane. When he said her
name I reached for my gun, but the lights were too bright. If a lifetime as a
movie junkie has taught me anything, it's that murder needs chiaroscuro.
Impulsive femmes fatales are doomed victims of sexy psychotics in the land of
shadows and secrets.
This Hollywood logic was at the back of my mind when I accepted the job showing
movies to murderers in Wormwood Scrubs. The play list for the Fun Film Club was
up to me. Every Thursday evening from September until December, we'd sit in the
dark together in an atmosphere of tragedy and revelation. After the show, there
would be time to confess to private obsessions with Jean Harlow's hair or
Montgomery Clift's eyes.
The day before I first met my murderers, I went to a 2pm screening of Naked
Kiss in the old cinema in Chinatown. Some people need an excuse to go to the
movies in the afternoon, and that day I had one. I had to decide whether to
start the Fun Film Club with Naked Kiss, or play safe with Reservoir Dogs. My
hands trembled as I bought my ticket. Out of the 40 cinemas in central London,
this one's practically my favourite. It was a good omen having Sam Fuller's
sexiest movie on in the Chinese rep - a place that would give your mum a heart
attack.
The best movies are often on during the day in cinemas frequented by wankers.
I'm the sort of voyeur who feels like taking a hammer to the head of anyone who
talks during a performance, so I have to avoid the OAP popcorn fights in the
Hampstead Everyman and the giggling teenagers in the Warner West End. Chinks on
opium sit through the whole film. China has always been my own private
Hollywood - a fantasy world of Fu Manchu power, Mother Gin-Sling decadence, and
Empress Ming eyeliner.
Naked Kiss had started already when I took my seat in the balcony. Constance
Towers, the actress who plays Kelly the prostitute, is scrutinising her face in
a sunlit mirror. Normally I sit in the stalls, as close as possible to the
screen. As Louis Malle said: ``My kind of cinema is based on the human face''.
But on my way in the manager warned: ``I wouldn't sit down there if I were
you''. He's not me, but I took the hint. I used to go to a cinema like this
when I was supposed to be watching cartoons at the Saturday Club. Mad Moira,
the Rio's usherette, shone her torch erratically in the dark, exposing wankers.
Masturbating men never sit next to me when I say in my Mae West voice: ``Pick
another row or I'll cut your head off and feed it to my dog''. In the dark,
it's impossible to tell if there's an Alsatian under the seat or not.
In Johnny Eager, early period Lana Turner says: ``He'd beat a woman if she made
him mad''. There's a look of longing on her face. She's a descendant of those
destructive heroines Scott Fitzgerald invented, disgusted and enthralled by
their dangerous glamour. Girls who ``had never, all along, intended doing
anything at all''; other than being too gorgeous to live.
Kelly in Naked Kiss is an unusual heroine. At the start of the film, she's
beating her pimp's brains in. In 90 minutes of tabloid action, Kelly gives up
prostitution for nursing; murders her millionaire child-molesting fiance; and
is imprisoned and released, ready to seduce another day.
Critics who deride Fuller's B-movie brutality underestimate the unique talent
involved in revealing a picture both decadent and pure. Constance Towers - an
actress I've only ever seen in Fuller movies - has the tainted purity of
Marilyn Monroe, the ironic intelligence of Marlene Dietrich, and the convincing
goodness of Audrey Hepburn. Kelly is that rare thing - a femme fatale who
survives, smiling.
Even in real life, the Hollywood goddesses are gone. Often deranged or
destitute before they died, at least they had the decency to drift into
obscurity first. Garbo stayed in her Manhattan apartment so that she could be
celebrated as a celluloid memory. Ava Gardner suffered insomnia in a flat
overlooking Hyde Park. Dietrich stayed in bed, alone, in Paris.
One fallen star remains, alive and obese, to symbolise those distorted
illusions lurking at the edge of MGM's soundstages. It's a long time since
large Liz has been beatific, but the evidence is there for anyone who can bear
to watch Taylor in A Place in the Sun. Incestuously cast with Montgomery Clift,
young superLiz is at her most ravishing. While watching her play Angela
Vicerks, it's almost possible to forget the bloated picture of her on the cover
of Hollywood Babylon.
The superficial intimacy between the audience and actors disintegrates when the
lights go back on. At the end of Naked Kiss, I still wasn't sure whether I
could risk showing it to the murderers. I might go berserk if they didn't like
it. Stumbling out into the rain, I walked from the Chinese cinema to the chapel
in Soho to light a candle. There was a leaflet left over from Cantonese mass -
a good omen.
After endless costume rehearsals, I decided to wear a Grace Kelly dress with a
solemn cardigan to my first Fun Film Club.
When I arrived at the prison everything seemed familiar. Passing through the
photogenic gates, recognisable from Ealing movies, I thought about that long
lineage of charismatic clever psychostars - from Cary Grant in Suspicion, to
Bob de Niro in Taxi Driver.
But, as Rita Hayworth said: ``Men go to bed with Gilda and they wake up with
me''. None of the murderers who slouched into the cramped screening room
adjoining a toilet was a dead ringer for Travis Bickle. Rather than tall, dark
and dangerous, they were alarmingly timid, with complexions which had never
benefited from broccoli.
A man with a stammer who bears a passing resemblance to Dr Lecter asked: ``Are
we seeing Superman?'' Dr Lecter's glamour comes from his intelligence, not his
pasty smile. This murderer is hot for films where, ``You know, people get hurt
but it isn't real''. I explained that actors rarely kill each other, but he
didn't get the joke. ``You don't understand,'' Dr Lecter said, ``in Superman
everybody really loves each other, really.''
I had two tapes in my bag and neither of them were Superman. A rave gangster in
the back row switched out the fluorescent light. I pressed play, and the
Reservoir Dogs gang appeared. The murderer on my right was eating smoky bacon
crisps. The murderer on my left had a carton of Ribena he offered to share.
After the show, I looked up my fellow voyeurs in the prison filing cabinet. The
babyish writing of Smoky Bacon's psychiatrist was scrawled in the margin of the
faded typewritten report: ``He is sorry''. Smoky Bacon battered a baby to death
with a hammer. Not his baby, just somebody's baby. But that's OK, because he's
sorry now. The psychiatrist is pleased.
Ribena, on the other hand, doesn't see what he's got to be sorry about. Ribena
stabbed a girl he didn't know 36 times, which reminds me of weepy Joan Fontaine
in Rebecca when she says: ``I wish I was 36 and wearing black velvet with a
string of pearls''.
There's something disturbing about leaving a movie before the end, even when
you've lost interest in the plot. At the Fun Film Club, I played the part of
Catwoman - verbally scratching anyone who didn't like my favourite films. But
the show didn't go on. I couldn't face finishing the season. Murder, like so
many things, is much more fun on-screen than it is in real life.
The movies have always been there for me, when I want them and when I need
them. I couldn't bear to have the purity of voyeuring soiled by seeing too many
movies with murderers. I'd rather sit in the dark with the devil I don't know.
The most universally accessible medium the world has ever known is 100 years
old. From the first flickering, jerky figures, through the heyday of Hollywood
to the hi-tech glamour of today, cinema has reached into and touched the dreams
of kings and commoners. In a
special issue this week, Weekend Extra takes up a
position behind the camera to celebrate the magic of
the movies. For the first reel Carole Morin, an addict who has braved some
seedy joints in pursuit of her
passion, appears in a dramatic episode at the
Fun Film Club in Wormwood Scrubs

HE'S been there, done that and has even got the T-shirt - Commonwealth Games,
Auckland, 1990 - to prove it. But Peter Henry, older, wiser and amazed by the
lack of opposition, is now ready for a second coming as a Scottish
international swimmer.
This weekend he begins his serious challenge to return to the fold at the
Scottish Winter Championships at Ayr. He has entered six events, and his sights
are firmly set on claiming gold in the 50m and 100m butterfly.
It is six years since he last appeared at Scotland's flagship short-course meet
- and much has happened in the interim.
Following the 1990 Commonwealth Games, Henry headed from Dunoon to the
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque on a swimming scholarship. But mid-way
through his five-year double major degree in Law and History, he opted out of
sport.
``I was completely burned out,'' he explained. ``I had been in competitive
swimming since I was 10, and I had had more than enough.
``There is a lot of pressure when you're swimming for a US college team.
They've invested a lot of money in you, and if you swim badly, you're in
trouble. It just got too much.''
But he is quick to stress that he has no regrets. He has secured a good degree
and he admits: ``It was a great life experience. I got to travel, and had a lot
of fun.''
His only regret is that he did not have a real go at making the 1992 Olympic
Games. ``The trials were a week after my finals. I hadn't prepared properly,
and I didn't perform.''
Henry, now 24, returned to Scotland at the start of this year, and filled in
some spare time with the odd visit to Dunoon pool. He entered the West District
Championships in March and, to his amazement, won the butterfly.
``I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``With hardly any training, I was the best
in the West. It is a sad reflection on the state of Scottish swimming. It's not
very competitive, and the standard has certainly fallen during my years away.''
He then spent a couple of months in New Zealand, and trained with former
Warrender coach, Kim Swanwick, at the Jasi Club near Christchurch. ``He's one
of the most talented coaches I've ever worked under. It's just a pity Scotland
lost him,'' commented Henry.
This season, he has continued his successful comeback at the West Open
Championships, and at the world-class Cumbernauld International Meet last month
he was the leading Scot, finishing a creditable sixth in the 100m butterfly in
58sec.
Suitably encouraged, he has stepped up his training, and has been working out
in the gym in readiness for this weekend.
He's also hoping that it will be a week of double celebration following recent
applications for accountancy traineeships. ``I've got as far as second
interviews, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll have a job by the end
of the week.''
While his career will take priority, he is equally set on adding to his
swimming credentials. ``I've always loved competing, and it would be nice to
get back into the Scottish squad.''
And how about a trip to Kuala Lumpur for the 1998 Commonwealth Games? ``It will
depend on work, but it's a nice thought,'' he agreed.
However, his ambitions remain realistic. He made friends with the former world
No.1, Tom Jager, during his time in the US, and admitted: ``I am never likely
to get anywhere near his standard.''
His time in America also made him starkly aware of the deficiencies in Scottish
swimming. ``The amount of money ploughed into the US college sport is
unbelievable. We had two Olympic-size pools and wonderful training facilities
at New Mexico.''
At Ayr, he aims to prove the benefit of that background, and force the Scottish
selectors to welcome him back.

CONSUMER reaction about the risk of contracting BSE from eating beef is
completely irrational given the available facts, yet beef sales are down
considerably, setting in motion a huge chain reaction down the line.
Even the store sales from crofters and hill farmers will be affected despite
the excellent product they produce.
As a means of getting killed, eating beef is less risky than driving a car,
climbing in the Glencoe hills, or even having sex. In fact, winning the lottery
is easier than contracting BSE for the simple reason that there is no record of
anyone being affected.
What is at stake is not the scientific facts but the public image of the farmer
as seen by a remote urban consumer.
Until now, the farming industry has not worried about its public image
preferring instead to concentrate on maximising production through the use of
high quality feeds and hormones which are a far cry from traditional methods.
Yet the consumer is attracted to those traditional methods whether classed as
``organic farming'' or ``sustainable farming.'' The label is all!
If the beef industry is to win back some of the ground lost to public reaction,
it must concentrate on traditional quality before permanent damage is done to
the industry.
For that reason, it is encouraging that the Scottish Agricultural Colleges are
conducting experiments at Craibstone and Morayshire on the production of
Aberdeen Angus beef on a sustainable farming basis.
These experiments, at least, give some hope for the future.

THE Jehovah's Witnesses have blocked a plan to brighten up Christmas in Lanark.
Civic leaders wanted to put on a dazzling display of lights after last year's
show was widely criticised. They planned to string them on shop fronts up and
down the High Street.
However, the cable had to run along the side of the Jehovah's Witness Kingdom
Hall near the top of the street.
When the council requested permission to use the church wall, it was refused.
``We don't celebrate Christmas. We don't want the cable along our church
wall,'' said Mr Jack Bell, who is in charge of the church, and known as the
presiding overseer.
Planners had to string up special lighting features on lampposts running down
the centre of the street, and a tree with lights in front of St Nicholas Parish
Church.
In the ensuing row on the issue, Mr Bell blames Clydesdale District Council for
leaking his name.
He said: ``All we asked is that they respect the sanctity of the church. It is
a consecrated building.
``Nobody has made a complaint about it to us. We don't believe in Christmas. We
believe it is a pagan festival. As far as I'm concerned, it is a matter of
confidentiality, between myself and the congregation.
``I feel that this is now a breach of confidence.
``The council asked us very politely if they could pin the lights to our
Kingdom Hall.
``In all senses of the word, it is a church so we felt it could not be done
because it was a commercial venture.''
However, Ms Janice Plenderleith, 50, of Wright's Florists, in Well Gate, summed
up many shopkeepers' feelings when she said: ``It's really mean.
``They don't like Christmas, so no-one else is going to. I think it is Scroogy.
I don't think they have got the right to force other people into it.
``We have been fighting for these lights for years, and now look what happens.''
Mr James Alexander, 56, a local butcher, said: ``It shows a very unchristian
attitude.
``I respect other people's religious beliefs but it's not right that people
should suffer because they don't believe in Christmas.''
Mr Robert Aitken, chairman of Lanark Merchants' Association, said: ``We were
trying to bring more shoppers to town with a great display of lights. The more
attractive the town looks, the more shoppers come.
``We were trying to overcome last year's lighting display which was a bit
pathetic.''
He said he had spoken to local people who told him that if Jehovah's Witnesses
``knock on their doors they'll get a heck of row''.
Last year, townsfolk were angry that the Christmas lights display consisted
merely of an unsightly yellow cable with lights draped around one tree in the
main street.
Clydesale district last night declined to comment on the row.

VIRGINIA Ryan Izzo says, in a matter-of-fact way: ``Series are perfect for
people who have to move around a lot. They give continuity.'' As the Australian
wife of an Italian diplomat, with two children and postings to Egypt, Brazil,
Belgrade, Rome, and Edinburgh over the past dozen years, she has experienced
both the good and bad of a peripatetic life - and learned how to put down roots
fast. Now after three years in Edinburgh where she and husband Giancarlo Izzo,
Consul-General of Italy, quickly became well-known and loved, they say farewell
next week, to return - for a while at least - to Rome.
Izzo takes with her a postgraduate diploma in art therapy (``I don't know when
I'll next be in an English-speaking country, so I decided to get my
qualifications here!'') but leaves a beautiful studio at the very top of their
huge New Town house.
``Giancarlo doesn't comment on my painting or interfere. He says `It's your
world'. But he's always made sure, when house hunting, that I have a studio.
This is a great room with top lighting, a Victorian iron fireplace, and superb
views of Edinburgh Castle. I even have a balcony! The studio is strangely bare
now. I had a whole wall full of pictures by friends but that's already been
packed away. It's as though I'm divorcing myself from Edinburgh bit by bit.''
Her large canvases were shipped home in the summer - before she was offered her
current farewell show. However, she had plenty of smaller abstracted paintings
and some large banners - plus her kitchen chair. I first saw her Chair of
Endless Wandering in her solo exhibition at Demarco's Festival show. On the
seat is a circle of chains. ``It's a rest-less chair, with no place to just sit
and be.'' Written all over it in white on black in tiny obsessive handwriting
are the words: ``Nowhere to call my home. My feet need to sit and rest''.
Although she is known as a painter, she began by studying photography at
Canberra's National Art School, so, coming full circle, she installed and
photographed the chair in Gullane; at Glasgow's St Mary's Cathedral during
Mayfest, at Edinburgh's 369 Gallery, and in her back garden among the autumn
leaves. ``In early 1996 I will photograph it under an olive tree in Trevi, at
my new home in Umbria. It will bridge the gap.''
Izzo's travels started young. Her fluent Italian dates from primary school days
in Rome when her father worked there. Diplomacy has connotations of the exotic,
of parties and high life, of jetting across the world to be met by stretch
limos and bouquets. Yet it does have its down-side. Although it would be wrong
to use an extreme word like exile, since her time in Belgrade during
Yugoslavia's war-torn 1990s, Izzo's art has been preoccupied with journeying
and with ``those who cannot go home''.
Empathising with victims of the Balkans conflict, she first produced a volume
of sketches, Sarajevo: Book of Secret Entries; then a series of painted wooden
discs, one for each year of her life; and then at the Edinburgh Festival in
1993, Home Europe, an installation where she turned a small, stone,
barrel-vaulted cellar into a shrine as a homage. ``Shovelling out years of
rubbish in the cold and damp, I realised I was acting out what is reality for
so many in the Balkans - with the cruel difference that I could leave and take
refuse in warmth and comfort.''
Journeying, dislocation, dispossession, migration, boundaries, and sanctuary
have continued to be her main themes which she explores via a vocabulary of
motifs. ``I use a limited number of images: eyes, hands, footprints, flowers,
the outline or frame of a basilica, spirals, barbed-wire and silhouette
figures.'' Pattern and texture are important, and always have been. ``I also
studied printmaking and surface marks are integral to my work.''
If all this makes Izzo sound a too-serious-person, let me put you straight.
There's another side which artist Edith Simon caught ``to a T'' in her portrait
of her dancing. The Izzos give memorable parties, enhanced by Virginia's
ability to be formal - or to let her hair down. ``It's the Italian side of my
personality!''
Izzo also has the ability to jump in at the deep end and engage people in her
projects. In 1994 she decided to make a series (that word again) of
six-metre-long painted banners inspired by four poems from Klaonica, Poems for
Bosnia: laments for refugees, dead children and lovers, which express grief for
a devastated country.
These were shown during the Edinburgh Festival at the Tron Kirk. Adrian Henri
was one of the poets, so she wrote to him. The upshot was that Henri came to
read his poems in the kirk surrounded by her red and black banners with their
outlines of fallen bodies and confused patterns of barbed wire which can also
turn into a field of flowers.
Though phrases from the poems are incorporated into the banners. Izzo likes
text in her work: paradiso, power, fiume di sangue, tempesto, life, love, often
in Italian and English, some inscribed backwards as in a stream of
consciousness. ``I sometimes work to music. The text is like a mantra.'' The
banners are not literal narratives, but an artist's response to the elegiac
tone of the poems, each with its own visual force field. The central imagery is
fenced in by a border of tyre tracks or watchful eyes (derived from the
Egyptians' love of outlined eyes as a protective talisman) resulting in a
meditative rather than a terrifying or repulsive image. ``The frame is about
containing; not letting my world fragment or break,'' she explains.
Brooding - not screaming. That was Izzo's way in Yugoslavia - and as if not to
forget that strife in the calm of Edinburgh, her house is plastered with her
pictures from different periods, different countries.
The discs were a result of living in Brazil, seen partly as an autobiography or
diary, partly a tribute to the native people and the late rubber-trapper, Chico
Mendez. Called Foresta (The Forest) they contain animals, figures, hammers,
arrows, and pathways, painted in a pointillist method using decorative dots, in
the style of Aboriginal art. ``It's as though each dot tells a mysterious
story.'' The discs were also part of a musical collaboration with Nigel Osborne
and Edinburgh postgraduates.
Izzo began painting by default. ``My photography was always manipulated, always
hand-generated. I applied very thin veils or layers over the image. I suppose I
still paint that way. Anyway I was spending eight hours a day in the darkroom,
and I got ill. The doctor said `get outside' - so I did and till recently,
never went back!
``I'm no longer apologetic about my lack of academic training in painting. I
tend to learn by doing; by experience. It's taken 20 years and the longer I go
on, the more simplified my work becomes. I've never been particularly narrative
or figurative. The cross over into semi-abstraction was always there. A sense
of immediacy is my main concern. To feel something - in at the heart, down
through the arm and out on to the paper or canvas. To me, that's what it's
about.''
To see Izzo explain her art in these three short, swift gestures - incisive,
direct, determined, vigorous - is to know that she will continue with her
commitment to art, and store up her memories of her ``northern exposure'' to
enrich her work in years to come.
n Virginia Izzo's exhibition is at Edinburgh's Italian Cultural Institute,
Nicolson Street, till January 12.

ATHLETICS:
FOR more than 100 years the AAA Championships have been open to foreigners, but
in the interest of picking the best Olympic team, next year's event will be
closed.
Only athletes eligible for Britain and Northern Ireland in Atlanta will be
allowed to enter, the AAA of England said yesterday. The decision salvages the
credibility of Dave Cropper whose tenure of both the chairmanship of the AAA
and UK selection committee looked incompatible.
The presence of overseas athletes often prevented top Britons reaching finals,
denying them the chance of making UK teams.
q ONLY four of the original East team for today's Inter-area cross-country
match at Cumbernauld survive: Dave Ross, Ken Chapman, Peter Dymoke and Martin
Ferguson. Some defectors have joined Scott Cohen in a protest at the course,
deeming it dangerous.
Missing are last year's winner Dave Cavers, Glen Stewart, and Frank McGowan,
but Stewart McCrae, who sets the trail for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Council,
denies rocks make the course hazardous. ``Heavy,'' he concedes, and will accept
adjectives such as ``relentless'' and ``challenging.''
In his day ploughed fields, raging burns and barbed wire fences were the norm.
``Athletes are not clones of some idealistic robolete . . . what's happened to
the men.''
West should take the men's title, but despite the West's defending Vikki
McPherson, East women may prove too strong.

THE advent of the video recorder has enabled film lovers to indulge their
obsession more than ever. Not only does it mean that film fans can now possess
their favourite movies, but also it allows them to watch them when the mood
takes them, and not when the TV schedule dictates. Some of the best movies -
especially thrillers - never have the same impact as the first time they're
seen; others can withstand, and often benefit from, multiple viewings. This
guide lists 30 films which are essential to any self-respecting film lover's
collection. Two criteria qualify the movies for this guide: they are all
available to buy on video, and they're all wonderful.
n.Annie Hall: Hilarious Woody Allen film about a neurotic TV writer (Allen) and
his various relationships: especially with the title character (Diane Keaton).
(1977)
n.The Apartment: Perfect Hogmanay viewing. Jack Lemmon stars as a lowly
insurance clerk whose apartment is used by various of his superiors to
entertain their lady friends. Billy Wilder's film is touching, hilarious and
downright brilliant. (1960)
n.Arsenic and Old Lace: Two spritely old spinster sisters enjoy a quiet life
poisoning lonely gentlemen callers until two of their nephews gatecrash the
set-up. Frank Capra's marvellously manic comedy has a glorious cast of comic
characters led by Cary Grant. (1942)
n.Born Yesterday: Sparkling comedy about a would-be corrupt politician whose
dazzlingly dizzy girlfriend (Judy Holliday) falls in love with the journalist
(William Holden) he's hired to make her more ``couth''. (1950)
n.Breakfast at Tiffany's: Not a great film but one with bags (Givenchy of
course) of style - the super-sophisticated Audrey Hepburn, gorgeous George
Peppard, and a beautiful, Oscar-winning song - Moon River. (1961)
n.Casablanca: One of the most romantic movies ever made. Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman try to sort out their love lives while Sam plays As Time Goes By
(again). (1942)
n.Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: Glamour galore as Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell
star as two girls on a manhunt in this often overlooked musical that features
songs such as Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend. (1953)
n.Gigi: Delightful Lerner &amp; Loewe musical set in the 1900s, about a gauche
teenager (Leslie Caron) maturing into an elegant young woman - under the nose
of Paris's most eligible bachelor, Louis Jourdan. (1958)
n.The Grapes of Wrath: John Ford's beautifully filmed adaptation of John
Steinbeck's moving novel about Oklahoma farmers heading for California is one
of the greatest films of all time. Henry Fonda stars. (1940)
n.Great Expectations: David Lean's stunning film is the most atmospheric of any
version of the Dickens novel (largely because of Guy Green's cinematography),
and arguably the greatest example of British cinema. John Mills is the older
Pip, Alec Guinness is Herbert Pocket and Martita Hunt is an eerily memorable
Miss Havisham. (1946)
n.Hannah and Her Sisters: Mia Farrow, Dianne Weist and Barbara Hershey star as
sisters in this wonderful, warm Woody Allen film which is just the thing to
watch over Christmas since it's all about families. (1986)
n.Harvey: James Stewart stars as harmless dipsomaniac Elwood P Dowd, whose best
pal is a six-foot rabbit called Harvey, and whose mortified sister wants to
have the pair of them committed. (1950)
n.High Society: Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong and
the Cole Porter score are the reasons for investing in this remake of The
Philadelphia Story. (1956)
n.His Girl Friday: Frantically paced screwball comedy stars the acid-tongued
Rosalind Russell as an ace reporter who - at editor (and ex-husband) Cary
Grant's request - postpones her wedding for the scoop of the century. (1940)
n.It's a Wonderful Life: Capra's Christmas classic is guaranteed to warm the
coldest of hearts. James Stewart stars as a small-town businessman who wishes
he'd never been born when he finds himself on the brink of bankruptcy on
Christmas Eve. Step in his guardian angel, a gentle and simple soul called
Clarence Oddbody, who shows him how his town would have been had he never
lived. Remember: No man is a failure who has friends. (1946)
n.Manhattan: Black and white masterpiece from Woody Allen about (you've guessed
it) a neurotic writer's relationships: especially with the title character. And
it's all set to a glorious Gershwin score. (1979)
n.Meet Me In St Louis: Wonderful musical set against the St Louis World Fair of
1903 stars Judy Garland and is a joy from start to finish. Songs include The
Trolley Song and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. (1944)
n.Mr Smith Goes to Washington: Capra's joyous social comedy-drama about a young
innocent triumphing over corrupt senators. James Stewart and Jean Arthur top a
superb cast. (1939)
n.My Darling Clementine: Best western ever. Henry Fonda stars as the legendary
Wyatt Earp in John Ford's lyrical version of events leading up to the famous
gunfight at the OK Corral. (1946)
n.A Night at the Opera: The Marx Brothers wreak havoc over an opera company in
this, their most consistently funny film. Only the musical scenes drag, and
that's when the fast forward button comes into its own. (1935)
n.On Moonlight Bay: Doris Day stars as a tomboy in love with boy-next-door
Gordon MacRae in this charming, and wholly entertaining, piece of Americana.
Followed by the equally enjoyable By the Light of the Silvery Moon. (1951)
n.Pal Joey: All-star version of John O'Hara's book. Rita Hayworth slinks, Kim
Novak pouts and Frank Sinatra croons jazzily - the Rodgers and Hart score
includes Lady is a Tramp and Bewitched. (1957)
n.The Philadelphia Story: Sophisticated comedy about a spoilt divorcee
(Katharine Hepburn) on the verge of remarriage, who won't admit that she still
loves her dashing ex-husband (Cary Grant). Oscar-winning Jimmy Stewart also
stars. (1940)
n.Pride and Prejudice: Forget your busty BBC version, this is the best:
Laurence Olivier as Darcy; Greer Garson as Elizabeth and a gem of a cast of MGM
character actors. (1940)
n.Raiders of the Lost Ark: Fabulous, action-packed romp is the first and best
of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Harrison Ford stars as the
archeologist-cum-adventurer. (1981)
n.Roman Holiday: Lovely romance about a beautiful young princess (Audrey
Hepburn) who escapes her guardians while on a state visit to Rome, and winds up
falling in love with an opportunist American reporter (Gregory Peck). (1953)
n.Scrooge: Alastair Sim is Ebenezer Scrooge in this unsurpassable version of
the Dickens classic which should be required viewing for any potential humbugs
over Christmas. (1951)
n.Sleepless in Seattle: Charmingly old-fashioned comedy-romance stars Meg Ryan
as the girl who falls in love with a widower (Tom Hanks) after hearing his
story on the radio. (1993)
n.Some Like It Hot: Brilliant comedy from Billy Wilder about two musicians
(Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) who join an all-girls' band while on the run from
dangerous gangsters. Marilyn Monroe is hilarious as the band's singer, Sugar
Kane. (1959)
n.When Harry Met Sally: Another Hogmanay must-watch. Heavily influenced by
Woody Allen's Annie Hall (itself a recommendation), this is a romantic comedy
about a couple who can't stand each other. Meg Ryan was never kookier and Billy
Crystal was never so bearable. (1989)
The video is now a universal possession, allowing
movie buffs to wallow in the romance, the glory
and the adventure of their own must-see films.

A SCOTS group is hoping to regenerate shipbuilding on the Clyde and create a
jobs spin-off for Inverclyde into the next century . . . by turning the clock
back more than 100 years.
The Scottish Maritime Sailing Trust is trying to raise funding for a
Clyde-built tall-masted ship and hopes that Operation Dreamboat, its submission
to the Millennium Commission, will get the project started.
Inverclyde District Council has given its support in principle to the trust's
bid for #3.5m - half of the proposed cost - from Millennium fund chiefs.
If the ambitious project succeeds, it could give a welcome long-term jobs boost
to the Greenock area.
The trust, in partnership with Renfrewshire Enterprise, has approached the
commission to seek funding, and been asked to submit more detailed information
on the proposal.
The Scottish partnership wants to build a vessel in the biggest of the tall
ships classes, along the lines of the Winston Churchill and Malcolm Miller,
accommodating up to 40 trainees and 10 full-time crew on each voyage. It hopes
to build it in time for the 1999 Tall Ships Race.
With all of the required expertise available locally, the hull could be built
at the Ferguson's yard and fitting out completed at either Scott's dry dock or
the East India harbour.
In a report on the proposal to be discussed by councillors in Greenock next
week, recreation services chief Ian Douglas says there could be a long-term
jobs spin-off if the scheme was approved.
He said: ``Initially, the project would offer training opportunities and, once
built, the vessel could be used as an ambassador for Inverclyde. It would also
be a visitor attraction when in dock.
``The trust is confident there will be ongoing work if a new ship-building
facility is developed.''
Trust members are now involved in a major fund-raising exercise in a bid to
show the Millennium Commission that they can match the money sought.

Skiing
GERMANY'S Katja Seizinger recorded her first World Cup downhill victory in
almost two years yesterday, ending American Picabo Street's streak of
consecutive wins. Olympic champion Seizinger collected her eighteenth career
victory in the World Cup and her first downhill win in 21 months in St Anton,
Austria.
Over the two legs of the downhill, a format forced on the organisers by lack of
snow at the top of the Kandahar slope, Seizinger recorded a combined time of
2min.6.68sec.
Fastest in the first leg, Seizinger carried an advantage of 0.20 seconds over
Heidi Zurbriggen going into the second run. The German posted the third-best
time on her second trip down the 1700m course with 1-03.46, and that was enough
to leave her comfortably in front of Zurbriggen.
Golf
ANTHONY Gilligan and Shane Robinson, of Australia, shared the second-round lead
in the Coolum Classic in Queenland yesterday after the big names crashed out.
Ian Baker-Finch, Peter O'Malley, Lucas Parsons, and Terry Price missed the
halfway cut of 148, while Craig Parry survived by one shot. Leading scores
(Australian unless stated):
138 - S Robinson 69, 69; A Gilligan 67, 71. 139 - S Leaney 72, 67. 140 - J
Evans 71, 69; S Alker (New Zealand) 70, 70; B Jackson (England) 70, 70.
SCOTLAND'S Simon Yates shot a second-round 73, one over par, for a halfway
aggregate of 149 to lie 11 adrift of Indian leader Jeev Milkha Singh in the
$200,000 Philippine Classic.
Tennis
STEFFI Graf has been ruled out of next month's Australian Open after having
undergone an operation for a chipped bone in her left foot.
ROSS Matheson beat Tom Hand 6-3, 6-4 to reach the last four of the Reebok
British Tour event in Corby. The Scottish No.2 then went down 6-2, 6-3 against
Paul Hand, who faces British No.3 Chris Wilkinson in today's final.
IVAN Lendl, who never won Wimbledon during his 18-year career, has been made an
honorary member of the All England Club.
Boxing
GARY Jacobs has been given the chance to win back his European welterweight
title. The Glaswegian gave up the belt to concentrate on winning the WBC title,
but was beaten by champion Pernell Whittaker in August.
Now the European Boxing Union have ordered their champion, Patrick Charpentier,
to make his next mandatory defence against 30-year-old Jacobs, with February 24
set as the closing date for purse bids.
MAURICE Core's bid to join the elite gang of three Britons who have won
post-war world light-heavyweight titles has been scuppered by flu. The
30-year-old Manchester fighter has been unable to shake off the bug, which has
forced his withdrawal from tonight's Hamburg meeting with Germany's unbeaten
WBO holder Dariusz Michalczewski. No new date has been set.
Meanwhile Commonwealth light-heavyweight champion Nicky Piper will replace Core
as challenger for Crawford Ashley's British title, with both fighters' belts at
stake. The British Boxing Board of Control have sanctioned a second meeting
between the pair, with a purse bid deadline of January 5, following Core's
withdrawal last month to concentrate on the now postponed Michalczewski clash.
Equestrianism
LUDGER Beerbaum warmed up for a repeat raid on the Olympia championship's big
prizes with a second-day victory at the London show. But the Olympic champion's
triumph in the Christmas Stocking Stakes with the nine-year-old, Avion, owed a
lot to a crucial mistake by Michael Whitaker on his first-day winner, My
Mesieur.
Whitaker clocked the best time in a contest decided by the fastest clear. But
he just clipped the first section of the two final doubles to rule himself out.
Beerbaum, with his inexperienced young partner, avoided errors to claim the
first place.
Brazilian Rodrigo Pessoa picked up the biggest prize of the first two days as
British riders missed their chance last night.
The 23-year-old Pessoa, riding Loro Piana Rose Garden, won a nine-horse
jump-off to collect the #5000 prize in the Eurosport Christmas Pudding Stakes.
He had the fastest of three clear rounds, but his time was beaten by all three
British riders - Nick Skelton, Robert Smith and John Whitaker - who each had a
fence down.

John Linklater sighs
deeply over the loss to moviemaking of Louise Brooks, the star who was too big
for Hollywood
AS a movie actress Louise Brooks was a wonderful aberration. Even more than
Garbo, whom she comprehensively out-Garboed, her face is recognised today
mainly from still photographs; familiar through her black-bobbed hairstyle more
than her features, beautiful though they remain. She has an incandescence that
far outlasts her career.
All but a few of her 24 films are lost forever. Only two deserve mention,
Pandora's Box and Diary Of A Lost Girl, both made with director G W Pabst in
Berlin in the late 1920s. They were silents. The sound of her voice is only a
matter of conjecture, alongside the testimonies of a select few who actually
knew her before she became a recluse, particularly lovers from Charlie Chaplin
to Humphrey Bogart and John Wayne.
This appears to present her as the ultimate groupie, yet nothing could be
further from the truth. She detested Hollywood. Anita Loos said, with as little
trace of bitchiness as understanding of what gentlemen genuinely admire, that
Louise's favourite form of exercise was walking off a film lot. Sometimes with
her favourite stuntman. Yet had Louise acceded to the casting couch manoeuvres
routinely proposed by producers and directors, her career would have been
easier. It might not have extended much beyond 1929 when, at the age of 23,
Louise more or less told the industry to stuff itself, but at the level of
personal politics she would have suffered less acrimony.
Had she chosen, Louise could have gone on to become as big (except that she was
five foot two, and wore six-inch heels to shoot scenes) as her direct
contemporaries Joan Crawford, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn. There are only
two years separating their birth dates between 1906 and 1908. This comes as a
shock, because the surviving photographs of Louise seem to quarantine her as a
silent goddess, a gagged flapper never heard in the talkies. That was her
choice. Compared to female product leads of the 1990s, identikit babes on
screen, interchangeable, unmemorable and depressingly unerotic, Crawford,
Davis, and Hepburn seem to represent an era when women stars were defiantly
their own women. Alongside Louise they were three amenable pussycats.
When in 1978 Kenneth Tynan tracked her down in Rochester, New York State,
Louise claimed never once to have seen any of her own films, or at least never
seen one sober. By then she was crippled by arthritis, zimmer-bound, never
venturing out of her flat, her hollowed face ravaged by an assiduous
partnership with gin, and her mind still sharp from a lifetime reading Proust,
Dostoevsky and Schopenhauer, a literary taste confirmed long after it had been
queried as a mere publicity stunt. In his essay Tynan is flattered enough to
divulge that Louise made a spirited pass at him, and dutifully reports that her
favourite lovers were English. Tragic that even such an experienced beauty
should reveal so culturally stunted a preference.
When Louise died 10 years ago a strong cult had already formed around her name,
at least partly encouraged by Tynan's efforts on behalf of her critical
rehabilitation. Certainly, little from her own. To the end, nobody was less
interested in the success of Louise Brooks than Louise herself. The only dream
she had ever entertained was to become a great dancer, for which she had been
training since childhood in south-east Kansas.
It was to improve her dance stage appearance that her mother had supervised the
cropping of her long black braids into the pair of sleek parentheses that
contained her still freckled face. Dance had secured her escape from Wichita
and brought her to New York. She was a speciality dancer with the Ziegfeld
Follies in 1925 when she signed her first film contract.
Louise had not been seeking a movie career. So unestablished was the industry
that she, in common with many, dismissed ``the flickers'' (``the movies'' only
caught on later) as an ephemeral sideshow. Paramount was still conveniently
based at its Astoria Studios on Long Island, otherwise she would never have
agreed to the capering diversion with which she treated her screen test. It was
her fate to possess a genius of which she, and anybody else, could not possibly
be aware up until that point. ``She is the intelligence of the cinematic
process, the perfect incarnation of that which is photogenic,'' Henri Langlois,
director of the Cinemathque Francaise, would describe it decades later. Louise
had stumbled into something she would never understand, or forgive.
``Pawed and applauded by millions of idiots,'' was H L Mencken's caustic
valediction on Rudolph Valentino, an unhappy man bewildered by an adulation and
success that he felt was controlling him. His sudden death in 1926 might have
confirmed all of Louise's instinctive distrust of this strange new phenomenon
with which she was cohabiting, but her exposure to Hollywood itself was delayed
until 1927, by which time she was being heavily promoted as one of Paramount's
``university'' of rising stars. The ``younger degeneration'', she called it.
Louise's problem in Hollywood was her fierce intelligence. She had a loner
streak. Strong independence had been encouraged by a mother who, frankly, had
made it clear she never intended to be over-burdened by her children. Louise
grew up feisty, speaking her mind. And her mind was ill-disposed to fools,
fawners, corporate bullies, see-through blouses of either sex and the
collective miasma of an industry geared to the mass-production of dreams.
Temperamentally, she was strictly and disdainfully insomniac.
``Hollywood is like floating through a sewer in a glass-bottomed boat,'' she
wrote half a century later. Even so, she survived three years of a five-year
contract with Paramount. In later life she had difficulty even remembering some
of the correct titles, but she made 14 films by 1928. She had also made a name
and created an image. She was the ``girl in the black helmet'', and her
trademark bob was discussed in film and fashion magazines. It was a hairstyle
for fast living. Not every single little breeze might be whispering ``Louise'',
but there was enough word out on her for the public to imagine it was Brooks
that Maurice Chevalier was singing about when Innocents of Paris was released
in 1929. That was also the year she got herself abruptly blacklisted by the
studios.
The final confrontation was Louise's giving Paramount the silent treatment when
they wanted to talk sound. She had co-starred with William Powell in making a
silent detective mystery, The Canary Murder Case, which the studio wanted to
commercialise by grafting on a soundtrack. It was at that stage in the history
of the movies when the talkies had arrived to stay. To everyone's astonishment,
Louise refused. She had previously been in dispute over a proposed cut in her
contract (in common with most studio stars as the talkies arrived), but now
every increased offer from Paramount was rejected. ``Come back, or you'll never
work in Hollywood again,'' was the final ultimatum. That was too leading a
cliche to resist. She was Louise Brooks. She was virtually programmed to reply
as she did: ``Who wants to work in Hollywood?''
She cut off her tongue to spite her face. The short-term satisfaction might
even have been worth the consequences, but there would be no way back. Critics
ridiculed the clumsy dubbing of Louise (by Margaret Livingston) for the release
of Canary, and Paramount retaliated by planting damaging stories that Louise's
voice was no use for the talkies. There was no truth in this, except Louise had
made herself non-negotiable. Tynan is among those who insist that her voice was
as melodious and true as a bell. She was obviously speaking nicely to him.
So Louise Brooks voluntarily joined the group of film actors assassinated by
the advent of sound. Clara Bow, the ``It'' girl of the 1920s, was made to feel
washed up with a Brooklyn accent. John Gilbert, MGM's box-office hearthrob of
the silver screen, was ridiculed for an allegedly high-pitched voice that did
not match his physique (although technical sabotage with the treble control
turned up was later revealed as the real culprit) and he died broken at the age
of 36.
Louise was 12 years younger. Contempt was her ultimate form of self-protection,
better than reliance on fashion and approval. In Louise you might call it
nihilism if you believed that it was herself, rather than an artificially
manufactured self, that she set out to destroy. In a new age that worships
ambition, her motives might appear incomprehensible. But Louise had values as
well as a dangerous talent. True artists are rare, and there is no place for
them in a competitive industry. Besides, she had another continent to try.
Europe wanted her.
The story goes that German director G W Pabst, who previously gave Garbo her
first lead outside of Sweden, had lined up an untried Marlene Dietrich for the
part of Lulu in Pandora's Box. Louise had been his first choice, but she was
contracted to Paramount. Dietrich was in his Berlin office ready to sign the
contract when Pabst received the cable breaking the news that Louise had quit
Hollywood and was available.
In later life mere mention of her rival actress, who would go on to make The
Blue Angel two years after losing Lulu, would prompt Louise into one of her
less charitable testimonials: ``Dietrich! That contraption!'' To think that
Louise left the bitch market open to Crawford and Davis. She could have walked
over them. We have to content ourself with what Louise achieved in Berlin.
If there is an argument about what was lost by the passing of the silent era,
the universal illusion sacrificed to the bland, the private trance of the
viewer rudely disturbed by scriptwriters' banalities, the active imagination
rendered passive, it finds its most persuasive illustration in Pandora's Box.
Dietrich, too worldly, too sexually ingenuous, too burlesque, too careerist,
would have been wrong for the role of the kept woman/lover/prostitute Lulu
committed only to momentary fulfilment, exploited sexual naif rather than
calculating man-eater. Pabst wanted the character as the ``personification of
primitive sexuality, who inspires evil unawares''. Brooks, his first choice,
was made for it. She was brilliant. Her performance was not just the triumph of
her own brief career, but one of the miracles of twentieth-century cinema.
It took 25 years to recognise this. Initial critical reaction was unfavourable.
German reviews, unable to accept an American actress in a part that had been
widely debated in advance, wanted more moral censure than Pabst's subtle
directing levelled at Louise. Americans were too caught up in the talkies to
have much time for such a mesmeric anachronism, and that has continued to
devalue the film outside of the film theatres. It doesn't even get television
showings. Louise would have approved.
She made another silent film for Pabst, Diary of a Lost Girl, and went on to
Paris to make Prix De Beaute in Paris, later dubbed in French, before returning
to America to face the music. She was ready to accept her film career as a
failure. Another project with Pabst fell through, and she sank into isolation.
There were some desultory efforts before she finally called it a day. As she
fell into poverty the studios were ready to give her humiliating bit parts as a
revenge. Her last picture credit was in 1938, a dismal cowboy effort called
Overland Stage Raiders with John Wayne. Wayne, after making 64 films, was just
about to make his breakthrough with Stagecoach. If that's what it took to make
a success in Hollywood, it must have represented the ultimate in unacceptable
compromise to a still defiant Louise. After her last test for a movie role she
was told: ``It stunk''. That was enough.
Louise slumped pretty low. After the failure of a dance school she set up in
Wichita, and an attempt to establish a career in radio soaps (if they got her
voice she was witholding her presence), she actually held down a job for two
years as a department store salesperson in New York, which must have been the
hardest role of her life. There were two broken marriages. In the index of her
biography, under love life, it is painful to monitor her decline. It goes
through film stars and directors, wealthy bankers and brokers, then gives
entries for ``hotel barman'' and ``Don the marine''. She would say that Lulu
was the story of her life, but she never quite added prostitution to her
problem with alcoholism. Friends eventually organised a small annuity to be
granted to her.
Her resurrection came through an unexpected medium, but it should have been
obvious all along that she could write. She liked to call herself ``the
best-read idiot in the world'', but as early as 1925 she had made a literary
debut in the New York Times. She had gone to the Broadway opening for No, No,
Nanette on the arm of Herman Mankiewicz, the second-string theatre reviewer of
the Times. Before he had fallen into a drunken sleep he asked Louise to keep
some notes of the show. She ended up filing a review under his name. ``A highly
meritorious paradigm of its kind,'' she opined elegantly.
The essays that Louise wrote a full 30 years later gave an outlet for her venom
on Hollywood. Portraits of Humphrey Bogart and W C Fields display an intriguing
mixture of savage insight, affection, much more technical understanding than
anyone would have believed into the mechanics of film acting, and sheer writing
craft. She writes about Garbo and Lillian Gish and Pabst. And she writes about
her own career, without vanity or pity. She was a survivor.
She was a terrible loss to Hollywood, because if it could not contend with a
Louise Brooks, a big part of its investment would never recover: its soul would
always be suspect, its intelligence unchallenged and its artistry corrupted by
the system. Louise's final words in her essay on the ``bloodless exile'' of
Greta Garbo might have been applied equally to her own dismissal: ``Hollywood
producers were left with their babes and a backwash of old-men stars, watching
the lights go out in one picture house after another across the country''.

GLASGOW has a tiger by the tail. The golden boy of British architecture and
design, ironically with the deeply foreign and oh-so-difficult-to-pronounce
name of Deyan Sudjic, has got the #65,000 job as director of the #10m Glasgow
UK City of Architecture and Design 1999. A unanimous choice. Definitely the
best man for the job. Brings international clout. That's the consensus of
experts and city fathers. Above all, the appointment shows Glasgow is serious
about 1999.
Reaction to the news has been little short of euphoric - and that in a city
noted for its cynicism - sighs of relief and smiles all round, as spirits rose
and the appointment was greeted with open arms.
For Sudjic, aged 43, is well respected for his intellect, energy, and
progressive, uncompromisingly modern taste and for an overall grasp of both
architecture and design. ``He's quite a polymath'' says Blueprint's editor,
Rowen Moore. ``I imagine that's why he got the job.'' Of particular relevance
is Sudjic's questioning attitude. He's interested in the bigger picture; at
looking beyond the building or object and its aesthetics, to the whys, hows and
wherefores; to what caused the recent profound changes in cities worldwide; and
what the future holds.
Neither is his internationalism in doubt. Currently visiting professor at
Vienna and orchestrating the 1996 Design as Identity exhibition for Copenhagen,
European City of Culture 1996, he travels widely and left Glasgow after
Monday's anouncement for a week abroad in those two cities.
Charming, erudite, articulate, with a track record of quality journalism,
exhibition organisation and numerous books to his name, he can also be
hard-hitting and does not suffer fools gladly. Dealing with the demands of the
different civic authorities - the district council, region and the GDA, who
currently make up the triumvirate in charge of 1999 - it won't get any easier
come unification. He will need teeth and determination to battle through local
authority red tape. Sudjic is no pushover and will stir things up for sure; no
bad thing after the 14 months of inertia following Glasgow's surprise win of UK
Capital of Architecture and Design.
Much rides on Glasgow's ability to make the most of this opportunity, yet the
city has been painfully slow in finding a strategy, and antagonised many who
were previously very committed to the project. Two years of volunteer labour
and goodwill, followed by a long lull, is bound to exhaust even the most
dedicated.
Alastair MacDonald, Janice Kirkpatrick, David Page and Per Kartvedt are just
some disillusioned key players.
``Architectural events take years to organise and there's a stop, slow, no-go
civic attitude. Once the private sector pressure group disappeared, so did the
action. There's no forum; no response; no momentum. It's as though we're losing
the very thing we worked so hard to win; knocked our pan out to no avail. We're
sick of contributing to things which become a bureaucratic disaster
orchestrated behind closed doors - when, ironically, Glasgow won the accolade
on its grass-roots empowerment!'' says MacDonald.
Sudjic must dispel this disquiet. Despite a reputation for arrogance, he would
be well-advised to listen to these very real complaints.
But already Sudjic's appointment has assuaged fears that the design element of
1999 was not being taken seriously, for he has a passion for innovative design,
spending a year as deputy editor of Design Magazine, then a decade as editor of
Blueprint, making it Britain's leading architecture/design magazine.
``At last we have someone who understands about quality; who knows good from
bad, and is completely aware of what's going on worldwide,'' says Kirkpatrick.
``He'll send out the right signals. Not parochial! We've got some hope now. I
just trust he'll be allowed to do the job.''
So who owns him? To whom is he responsible? Significantly, Monday's event was
moved from 1999's Princes Square base to the City Chambers at the last minute,
depriving everyone of a view of the excellent GSA MA Design exhibition there.
So will Pat Lally and Stuart Gulliver pull his strings? ``No-one owns me,''
Sudjic told me on the telephone from Vienna, his voice sharp and to the point.
In fact, he's responsible to the board of the new 1999 charity ``company Ltd by
guarantee'', as yet not formally constituted but including Lally, Gulliver,
Wright, Dugald Cameron, Conran, and others.
So why on earth move from sunny London to rainy Scotland? ``I'm always looking
for new challenges. I'm doing this because it should be fun. I've got a lot to
give, too. I see the job as workable and liveable. If I thought it was an
impossible job, I wouldn't have taken it.''
Sudjic was born in 1952 in London. His Yugoslav parents came to the UK in 1938.
His mother did post-graduate English at Edinburgh University while his
journalist father worked for the BBC World Service. They went back to
Yugoslavia in 1948 with two sons (one now a Kirkcaldy lawyer, also trained at
Edinburgh; the other a dentist) but communism palled and they returned in 1950.
``I had a London childhood; went to Latymer. It was rather theatrical. Hugh
Grant went there!'' In 1959 he took to journalism as one of the Oz school kids,
``Truly!'', then to Edinburgh University to read architecture 1970-76.
``I'd been making houses out of cardboard since I was 10. And I didn't want to
be a journalist. Edinburgh was a fantastic, beautiful place - though the pubs
closed at 10pm. The teaching was less inspired. Our first project was to draw
the drawing board! The second to design a car park.''
Contemporaries included John McCaslan of Canary Wharf fame. While editing the
student newspaper (and campaigning for Gordon Brown) he discovered he loved
writing.
A year in the GLC's architecture office (jobs included the Barbican) made him
``hopelessly impatient, frustrated and depressed. I really admire people who
have the range of skills needed: the sheer neck to get your ideas through and
the practical on-site skills when building. I had a narrow escape''.
His writing covers Architects Journal (``I learned more about architecture in
three years there than at Edinburgh''), Building Design, Sunday Times 1981-5
(``When Andrew Neil arrived I was ordered into the news room where I sat beside
Andrew Jaspan''), Guardian architecture critic - which he still is - but by
1983 he was keen to work for himself.
``About 1980 I became a workaholic. I was fairly relaxed before but then I did
a series of books (the first was Cult Objects in 1983, interpreting the
messages things have: Levis, Sottsass's Valentine typewriter, the Filofax,
Ray-Bans and the joys of matt black) as well as my Times job, plus setting up
Blueprint with a few chums.
``We published every three weeks, doing the whole thing including paste-up over
one weekend. We expected it to last six issues!'' Blueprint went on to win
major awards for editorial and design quality, setting new standards of
excellence. The business grew into Wordsearch Publishing, with a turnover of
#2m pounds a year and 25 employees. Wordsearch also produces Tate, and has a
graphic design service.
In 1993, he decided to step back. ``Ten years is enough.'' Now managing editor,
he still writes for Blueprint and has responsibility for financial planning.
Books include monographs on Ron Arad, Kawakubo, Expo 92, English Extremists,
Pawson, Rogers and Foster, with his 1992 book, The 100-Mile City, well known.
``It was an absurdly ambitious project showing how cities changed in the 1980s
into a completely new species; how five world cities - Paris, Tokyo, London, LA
and New York - are fighting it out when an urban soup now regularly stretches
for 100 miles. I saw the early warning signals. The book took two years;
exhausting but satisfying!''
He sees Glasgow as ``remarkably focused'', a natural partner to Barcelona,
Chicago, Helsinki, Vienna, and Prague.
``Glasgow has got itself on to the international circuit. It has a critical
mass and knows how to use design and architecture to express its identity. And
it's big enough to be surprising!''
Architecture was passion number one; then design and cities. But another of
Sudjic's talents is exhibition organising. I well remember the opening of the
1986 Foster, Rogers, Stirling show at London's Royal Academy - a stunning event
which attracted more than 100,000 visitors. He has also co-curated shows at the
ICA, RIBA and Italy on Nigel Coates, Paulson, Farell, Gough, the Chair, and the
Public Realm.
``I feel it's very important that 1999 shows be originated in Glasgow.
Architecture exhibitions should not be books on walls; they need exciting stage
management and must be aimed at people who would not know what architecture was
if it came up and bit them.''
Sudjic will live in ``urban Glasgow'', starting his four-year contract on
February 1. His wife and seven-year-old daughter arrive ``at the new term''.
His office will be in Princes Square's 1999 shop, later moving to the
Lighthouse Building. He will not share offices with Mike Hayes in the planning
department. ``We felt 1999 should stand on its own,'' Hayes told me.
``Glasgow is a stunning, exhilarating city,'' Sudjic says. ``The quality of
architecture is tremendous!'' He admits to no experience of housing
associations, but has help on hand as Pauline Gallacher of Share has been
appointed to Sudjic's 1999 team.
``I'm not a design dictator; I want to learn where the currents flow and asked
for someone to show me. I'll provide the seed but not work in a confined box. I
want to do things the Glasgow way.''
His immediate three-point plan is ``to get to know all the players in the city;
to see the venues and to produce a timetable. My role is to harness and focus
energies......''. He says his job is ``the best challenge since the Festival of
Britain 50 years ago''. Aware that Glasgow's bid was not about ``grandes
projects'', he proposes ``making the best of what you have, with consolidation
in the centre of the city'', but cites Barcelona's ``peripheral squares and
cheap interventions on the edges'' as something that could profitably be
applied to Glasgow.
Gulliver, one of Sudjic's selectors, along with Lally, Gould, Hayes, Bob Palmer
and architect Andrew Wright, refutes criticisms about delays in 1999's
progress. ``Until the conductor arrives the orchestra can't play.''
He also assures me: ``Yes, we've got to give him his head.'' Likewise Sudjic
has a reputation for appointing the right people and letting them get on with
it.
Sudjic was chosen from an initial application of 70, including 10 headhunted
names, three of whom (Sudjic, Victoria Thornton and Rory Coonan) made the
finals along with Scots Neil Baxter and Frank Binnie. Sir Terence Conran
endorsed Sudjic's appointment: ``Terrific. Good news. He has an eye, contacts
and knowledge, the abilty to give intellectual leadership and is in tune with
Glasgow's politics.''
Andy Harold of Nice House says: ``He has world stature. Whether he's an
organiser remains to be seen, but he's got my vote. He should enjoy himself
here, and Nice House will throw the party!''
As a welcome, you can't say fairer than that.

COMPLAINTS about ineligible voters were far more extensive than the 52 papers
rejected in the disputed Glasgow Govan selection process, The Herald has
learned.
As many as 180 votes were questioned at the count to select a candidate for the
new constituency, before 52 were rejected because of doubts over authenticity -
fuelling complaints of racism by supporters of Mohammed Sarwar.
The row within the Labour Party escalated last night when Hillhead MP George
Galloway added his voice to the claims of racism. He denounced the election at
a meeting in Yorkshire, where he shared a platform with the Pakistani High
Commissioner.
He told guests at the Bombay Brasserie in Bradford: ``This debacle represents a
shameful injustice to Mohammed Sarwar - an elected councillor and member of the
party's national executive in Scotland - to the many thousands of Pakistani
voters in the Govan constituency, and to the two million Muslims living in
Britain.
``It is a decision that has no credibility and one which must not be allowed to
stand.''
It was, he claimed, a breach of natural justice which would not stand up in
court.
The party hierarchy in London has resigned itself an inquiry - not yet formally
announced but bound to have damaging fall-out when, as expected, it reports
next month. Mr Sarwar told The Herald he was confident that any inquiry would
exonerate any of his supporters of wrong-doing.
``I have nothing to fear,'' he said last night. He pointed out that ballot
papers had been sent out for a postal ballot, making a nonsense of the
suggestion of false names or fake identities.
Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson won by a single vote on a count-back procedure.
The 245 for Mr Watson were matched by an identical figure for Mr Sarwar. Of the
18 voters for candidate Margaret Curran, 17 had expressed a preference and when
these were redistributed a dead heat came about. The rules were then invoked to
go back to the first ballot, in which Mr Watson had won by 237 to 236.
By then 52 votes had been ruled ineligible - a majority of them supporters of
Mr Sarwar. However, The Herald understands that there were around 180 voting
forms questioned by the scrutineers.
Ms Lesley Quinn, Scottish Labour Party organiser, was asked to rule on these
and allowed all but 52 to stand. Three were unsigned, and therefore
automatically barred, and 49 were deemed to be clear cases where signatures
failed to match.
Mr Sarwar said he would give the party the weekend to consider his request for
an inquiry and, failing that, he would make a further announcement - a
reference which may be taken as a threat of legal action.
Scottish general secretary Jack McConnell was in London yesterday, but for a
strategy meeting which did not discuss the Govan issue. However, the issue will
come before the NEC on January 24 - a meeting which will also be dominated by
the party's inquiry into the Monklands saga.
That meeting will have a straight choice before it - to call a rerun of the
Govan count, or to reject Mr Sarwar's complaint.
Last night, the SNP, which once captured the old Govan constituency, moved to
make capital from the row. Mr Bashir Ahmed, convener of Scots Asians for
Independence, said the unedifying spectacle would worry many in his
constituency and contrasted with his experience in the SNP.
``There was a wonderfully warm reception extended to us when we launched Scots
Asians for Independence at the SNP conference. We are delighted to be playing a
full part in the activities of the party as we work with our fellow Scots to
build a new Scotland. Our message to all Asian people in Scotland is to come
and join us.''

HAMPDEN Park has been awarded a grant of up to #23m by the Millennium
Commission, which will help turn it into one of the finest stadiums in the
world.
By far the biggest single National Lottery award made in Scotland, not only
will it help complete the redevelopment of the national football stadium but
will also create a centre of excellence for players and spectators.
The redevelopment, which has a total cost of #51m, will increase Hampden's
capacity from 34,000 to 52,000.
The Millennium Commission grant will be used towards the building of a new
south stand, which will house facilities for players, officials, and
supporters, and eight dressing rooms. The structure will have a 50-metre roof
span and is expected to be the biggest of its kind in Britain.
It will also include an international media centre and a museum of football.
Queen's Park Football Club, which set up the National Stadium Committee (NSC)
in conjunction with the SFA to oversee the redevelopment of the 92-year-old
ground, said that with funding totalling almost as much again in place, it was
``very confident'' the redevelopment would be completed by early 1998.
Announcing the grant at Hampden Park yesterday, the Earl of Dalkeith, the only
Scottish member among the nine on the commission, said its decision was based
on the fact that the project was bigger than Hampden Park alone and would be
``available to all''.
He added that ``we were convinced by the evidence produced by Queen's Park and
many other people that this would genuinely be appreciated by the people who
buy lottery tickets in Scotland. That is very important because it is their
money.''

A WORKER forced to make a ``dreadful bargain'' between his health and keeping a
job was yesterday awarded damages of #37,000.
Mr Thomas Bonar, 36, has worked as a painter for Trafalgar House Offshore
Fabrication at its yard in Methil, Fife, since May 1990. He contracted
occupational asthma as a result of his working conditions. Trafalgar admitted
liability.
Assessing damages at the Court of Session, Lord Gill said Mr Bonar, of
Ochilview Drive, High Valleyfield, Fife, had worked as a spray painter since he
left school 20 years ago.
He began to use a new type of paint in 1993 which caused him acute discomfort.
He coughed uncontrollably, his throat became irritated, and he had nose bleeds.
He was no longer working with the paint that had caused the problem but still
suffered from breathlessness, coughing, and disturbed sleep. He tired quickly
if exerted and could not walk for any great distance.
Lord Gill said: ``Mr Bonar is a hard-working tradesman who is enthusiastic
about his work. He says that painting has been his life.
``He has not given in to his condition. He has continued at his work and has
done as much overtime as is available to him. To his credit, he has maintained
this effort despite his symptoms, which make his work more difficult and
arduous.''
He now also had a ``considerable burden of medication'' to take and attended
hospital every four months.
Dr Gavin Petrie, a consultant chest physician with Fife Health Board, described
the condition as incurable and said Mr Bonar would need continuing supervision,
advice, and treatment, perhaps for the rest of his life.
Lord Gill added: ``If he continues in his present working conditions, there is
a material risk that further respiratory irritation may cause his condition to
deteriorate. A further deterioration could lead to a severe and irreversible
airflow obstruction.''
Lord Gill said doctors recognised the dilemma that had been created for Mr
Bonar. ``The best clinical advice would be that he should give up his present
employment but, as he is a committed and energetic worker and has no other
qualification or skill, such advice could well lead to long-term unemployment.
``Dr Petrie has aptly described Mr Bonar as having a dreadful bargain to make
between present employment and future health. He has made the dreadful bargain
to which Dr Petrie referred.''

q.IT is not often that a team visits Albion Rovers in the hope of an upset, but
that is the case today when the Highland League's Deveronvale travel to
Coatbridge for a first-round tie in the Tennents Scottish Cup, one of the three
matches postponed last week.
An upset success would mean an all-Highland tie in the second round, as Keith
visit the victors.
Rovers have been taking no chances and Deveronvale have been watched by the
backroom staff at Cliftonhill.
One non-league team is sure to progress, as Edinburgh club Spartans visit
Glasgow University at Westerlands.
The team who were the main giant-killers last season, Stenhousemuir, have a
busy weekend, beginning with today's league match against Gordon Dalziel's Ayr
United.
'Muir will celebrate their more recent giant-killing act, which earned them
this season's Challenge Cup, with a gala night for the fans tomorrow in the
town's Dobbie Hall. The Warriors also have a video and a book about their
Challenge Cup win.
East Fife's impressive away record will be tested by Clyde at Broadwood, while
Stirling Albion's unbeaten run could be under threat from Queen of the South at
Dumfries. Berwick should keep the points at home against Montrose and Stranraer
are hopeful of victory at Forfar.
The third division's top two meet at Brechin, with Livingston's unbeaten away
record under threat. But Jim Leishman's men will be boosted by last week's cup
win at Stranraer.

A TEN-YEAR-OLD boy with serious head injuries had to be driven 45 miles to
hospital because of a bed shortage, just a week after another child died making
the same journey.
Christopher Satterthwaite was hit by a car in Salford, Greater Manchester, on
Thursday night, but there were no intensive care beds available in the county's
two children's hospitals.
An ambulance had to drive him to Leeds General Infirmary, where yesterday he
was described as ``stable'', with a broken pelvis and elbow.
A top-level inquiry has already been ordered by the North West Regional Health
Authority into the death of Nicholas Geldard, 10, who collapsed with a
suspected brain haemorrhage at his home in Stockport last week.
He was taken to three different hospitals in the area before being driven to
the same Leeds hospital. He was dead on arrival. His parents are now
considering legal action.
A consultant said Christopher was the 31st child, since August 1, who had been
moved to a hospital outside Greater Manchester because of a shortage of beds at
the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and Booth Hall Children's Hospital.
Labour health spokeswoman Harriet Harman has called on Health Secretary Stephen
Dorrell to investigate.

INTENSE pre-Christmas political activity over the Northern Ireland peace
process began yesterday, with the first formal meeting in Belfast of an
international commission bidding to resolve the row over arms.
The three-man body, established by the British and Irish Governments, and
chaired by former US Senator George Mitchell, hopes to pave the way to
all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland by February.
Yesterday, the group opened its behind-closed-doors work by hearing a
Government submission from a team led by Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew.
Belfast-based politicians, including fringe loyalist groups associated to
para-military organisations, will outline their views today.
Afterwards, the commission - also including former Finnish Prime Minister Harri
Holkeri and Canadian Defence Forces Chief General John de Chastelain - moves on
to Dublin.
There it will hear from the Irish Government and political parties, including
Sinn Fein.
Mr Mitchell and his colleagues went into yesterday's opening meeting stressing
that they had no preconceived ideas about overcoming the problems confronting
them.
He told journalists: ``We enter the process with open minds.......motivated
solely by a desire to make a constructive contribution.''
More seasonally, Mr Holkeri pointed out that while he came from the home of
Santa Claus, he was not a political Father Christmas for Northern Ireland's
peace process.
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams signalled that the commission would
face no easy task in solving the arms controversy.
Commenting in Dublin, he underlined his party's continuing resistance to
British demands that the IRA had to move towards decommissioning weapons before
its Sinn Fein allies could join any all-party talks.
Mr Adams also said his party could talk authoritatively about IRA arms, while
holding out few prospects of advancing the peace process until Britain relaxed
its stance on the weapons.
Soon after the international body completes its first session in Dublin, the
Irish capital will stage, on successive days, a meeting of the Anglo-Irish
inter-governmental Northern Ireland Conference, and a prime ministerial summit.
Wednesday's conference will set the stage for visits to Belfast and Dublin by
Prime Minister John Major, 24 hours later.
In Dublin talks with Irish counterpart John Bruton, Mr Major will attempt to
boost the whole peace process.
Yesterday, a senior colleague of Mr Bruton's, Social Welfare Minister Proinsias
De Rossa, urged Mr Major to take advantage of his trip to Ireland to have a
face-to-face meeting with Mr Adams.
Last night, the Rev.Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party defended its
decision not to meet the arms commission.
The party had new talks in Belfast with the Ulster Unionists, who are to make a
submission to Mr Mitchell today.
Former Belfast Lord Mayor Nigel Dodds said he viewed with ``extreme distaste''
what he regarded as an attempt to internationalise the situation in Northern
Ireland.
He told BBC Radio Ulster: ``We have an issue which goes to the very heart of
security of part of the UK, where vast stockpiles of arms and ammunition are
being held by terrorist organisations. That's a matter for the Government.
``We deplore the fact that a very influential American politician is being
brought in to deal with this issue. If it's okay to deal with this issue, then
the question has to be asked: Why could the same sort of internationalisation
and externalisation not take place in relation to other matters which should be
within the Government's domain?'' said Mr Dodds.

MEMBERS of the public who turned up for the fifth meeting of the West of
Scotland Water Authority on water charges last night expressed their outrage at
being thrown out.
The authority's four previous meetings ended in chaos after demonstrations by
members of the Hands Off Scottish Water campaign and the West of Scotland
Campaign Against Water Privatisation.
Yesterday, the authority met on Bute to discuss the Scottish Office move to cap
water charge rises at 6%, declaring it was confident that it could contain
water rate rises close to the level set by the Scottish Secretary.
However, members of the public who attended the meeting after seeing an
advertisement in the local newspaper said they were disgusted at being asked to
leave.
Mr Gerry Chambers, manager of Rothesay's Winter Garden complex, was talked down
by the authority's chairman, Mr John Jameson, when he rose to ask a question.
Mr Chambers said: ``This is a complete travesty and I am very disappointed that
the public are not being given the opportunity to question the water authority
at a public meeting.''
Concern was also expressed by the chairman of the Isle of Bute branch of the
SNP, Mr Donnie McLeod, who described the running of the public meetings as
completely undemocratic.
``The members of the board should at least be prepared to listen to what people
have to say. There was no attempt to disrupt this meeting today. Reading out
the minutes of a previous meeting and then calling the proceedings to a close
is a complete sham,'' he said.
The meeting ended when a member of the West of Scotland Campaign Against Water
Privatisation, dressed in a Santa suit, presented Mr Jameson with a mock-up of
his P45.
The debacle came as Scotland's water watchdog announced it was to ask consumers
for their views on the quality of service offered by the three water
authorities and on how complaints were being dealt with.
Meeting in Stirling yesterday, the Scottish Water and Sewage Customers Council
also announced plans for a permanent headquarters to be based in Stirling's
Springkerse business park. The council is based in Edinburgh at present.
While not revealing how much money would be spent on the countrywide customer
survey, the council's chairman and SNP member, Mr Dick Douglas, said its
purpose would be to establish what the public felt about the water authorities,
charges and services by March next year.
``What we want to establish is a base line on what people think of water
service. I can't say how much the questionnaire will cost but it will be a lean
and mean exercise. We are not in the business of throwing away money.''

Jackson scare
NEW YORK: Singer Michael Jackson may have been within 15 minutes of dying when
he collapsed last week, his doctor told the New York Post. ``Michael was
acutely and dangerously ill for hours,'' Dr Allan Metzger said. Jackson, who
was rehearsing for a television special when he collapsed on December 6,
suffered from low blood pressure and a dangerous loss of electrolytes, Metzger
said.
Collapse kills six
BOMBAY: Rescuers worked desperately yesterday to free 27 people trapped in the
ruins of a partly-completed block of flats which collapsed at Mumbra near
Bombay, killing six people. The four-storey block collapsed as the builder was
showing visitors around the site, police said. He was one of those killed.
Nuclear row
NEW DELHI: India is preparing for its first nuclear test in 21 years in a move
some see as muscle-flexing to impress neighbouring Pakistan and keep the
current Indian government in power, it was reported yesterday. The United
States is trying to dissuade India from carrying out the test, fearing it could
trigger other tests among the world's nuclear powers.

<TEXT>
LOGANAIR, ``Scotland's Airline'', is to be run from the Isle of Man.
Managing director Scott Grier confirmed yesterday that ``up to a dozen''
accounts and administration staff at Loganair's Glasgow headquarters had been
offered the choice of a move to the Isle of Man or redundancy.
Mr Grier denied the ``rationalisation'' amounted to a take-over of the Scottish
commuter airline by Manx Airlines. Services would be unaffected and the
travelling public would not notice the difference, he said.
``For the past 16 months, we've been operating in parallel with Manx,'' he
said. ``We're both British Airways franchise holders and there's some
duplication. The board feel it's time to rationalise.''
Flying operations and most of Loganair's 200 staff would stay at Glasgow
Airport. The company had no plans to change its services to Orkney, Shetland,
and the Western Isles, or the vital air ambulance service.
Loganair, Manx Airlines, Manx Europe, and the much larger British Midland
Airways are all wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Airlines of Britain group, set
up in 1987.
Mr Grier said the three smaller airlines would share accounts and
administration under a new ``sub-group'' based in the Isle of Man: ``In effect,
we'll have one accounts department instead of three, but the activities of each
operator will continue to be accounted for separately,'' he said.
Loganair staff were called together on Wednesday this week and told of the
plans. Mr Grier said he was ``personally very upset'' that some employees who
were not able to move to the Isle of Man would become redundant. However, he
believed staff in general were ``very pleased'' because the decision ``put an
end to uncertainty''.
``There's no question of a Manx takeover,'' he said. ``Loganair will retain its
separate identity. We knew when we became a British Airways franchise operation
that it would bring many benefits but we did give up our identity to a degree,
in that we lost our own livery and uniforms.''
Loganair also lost some of its larger planes to Manx but Mr Grier hoped ``in
the fullness of time'' to have access to bigger aircraft.
Mr Trevor Booth, Loganair's engineering boss in Glasgow, is leaving the company
to join British Midland, Mr Grier said.

PRIME Minister John Major yesterday criticised the Euro, the proposed name for
the EU's single currency, as uninspiring, unimaginative, undignified, and the
lowest common denominator - even before it was born.
He then agreed to European economic and monetary union, which will lead to the
new money, on its scheduled date of January 1, 1999.
Tory Euro-sceptics are certain to be enraged by Mr Major's decision. Their mood
will hardly be helped by pro-European Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's statement
that he did not expect his party to include a pledge to keep Britain out of a
single currency in the General Election manifesto.
Mr Clarke also predicted that a British decision on whether to join a single
currency is now most likely in March 1998, when the first wave of eligible
countries is due to be selected if the current timetable is kept.
If all goes to plan, Europeans whose countries adopt the new coinage, will
begin jingling Euros in the pockets and purses in the year 2002. About half of
the EU's 15 member states are on course to qualify for membership of the single
currency, including Britain which has negotiated the right to opt out.
A decision on whether to use the opt-out must be taken by the Government which
wins the next election - expected by spring of 1997 - in the early part of 1998.
No symbol for the new money has been created so far to rival the American $ or
the Japanese Y. The currency will be decimal but no decision has been taken on
the name of the 100 units making up the Euro.
Mr Major's lack of enthusiasm for the new money was fuelled by suspicion of its
effects on currencies which do not join the process. He foresaw the Euro being
too strong for its rivals.
He told the BBC: ``Then there is a danger of competitive devaluation and
retaliatory protectionism across the community. And the self-evident worry
about that - a very real worry - is that the single market itself could become
damaged, if not destroyed.''
Nevertheless, his party Euro-sceptics are bound to give him a hard time over
agreeing a name calculated to raise the hackles of the dedicated sceptic Tory
back bencher.
Euro-sceptic Tory MP Bill Cash said: ``The proposal to go ahead with monetary
union and with the so-called Euro will go down as a complete disaster in
British and European history.
``We must resist this mood and I am amazed that we did not take further steps
to oppose it.''
The name was chosen against the favoured option of French president, Jacques
Chirac, who wanted the denomination to be called the Ecu, the EU's nominal
currency. He was supported by President Jacques Santer of the European
Commission.
Both pleas were steamrolled by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who backed the
Euro and won.
There was no formal vote, in keeping with all summits.
Chancellor Clarke had suggested florin, shilling, and crown as possible
alternatives.
Four member states, including Ireland, supported the florin and there was
backing for several other names but none proved as uncontentious as the Euro.
Those currencies most likely to disappear first are the Deutschmark, the
Austrian schilling, the Dutch guilder, and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs
which are a single currency already. These countries represent the hard
currency states of the EU who are expected to form the core group of Emu
founders.
They could be joined by the French franc if France meets the so-called
convergence criteria demanded by the Maastricht treaty for economic and
monetary union (Emu). Britain and Denmark will also probably qualify although
both are undecided on whether to invoke the opt-out when the time comes.
Mr Major showed most interest in the effects of Emu on those countries which
remain outside it. His particular concern is that a small group of EU single
currency member states could begin voting as a bloc on political issues, thus
undermining the consensualist tradition of the European Union - and possibly
damaging British interests.
At Mr Major's insistence, the Spanish prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, who
chaired the discussion, agreed to pass on to the Italians the responsibility
for investigating the effects of Emu on non-single currency member states.
This will give Mr Major more time to put off making up his mind on whether
Britain should join the single currency which represents the EU's most
ambitious scheme in its four decades of existence.
He can also go to next spring's crucial Maastricht II conference in Turin in
the knowledge that the single currency issue should not cramp his style. Emu is
not on the formal agenda of that meeting.
Britain is expected to spend millions of pounds familiarising the public with
the Euro.
Comparisons are being drawn with the publicity blitz which lasted for seven
years in the run-up to decimalisation of Britain's currency in 1971.
A blueprint for the European-wide campaign was produced recently by the
European Commission. It wants the community's member states to pick up most of
the cost of educating the public.

playing days. ``You didn't think it was all going the be plain sailing all your
life, did you?'' said Ferguson, as he chatted with the manager of Motherwell.
There was no need for an answer.
Fergie's fatherly intervention reinforced the realisation that, while his
playing career that brought every kind of prize and accolade with Aberdeen and
a record number of caps for his country, it did not necessarily provide
precisely the experience needed to understand the vicissitudes of managership.
McLeish's worst days as a player were soon after Ferguson left and Aberdeen
finished something like fifth in the table. For them that was failure, although
later they came very close to the real thing.
Now as a manager in his own right, McLeish has to confront a numbing sensation
as a bottom-of-the-league man. That might have been less daunting if he had
suffered such a fate in his first season, but it has come following a
marvellous opening year, during which Motherwell finished second in the premier
division and were justifiably lauded for the quality of their play.
``In fact, we would have been top of the table at one point had Dundee United
not equalised against us in injury time when we were heading for our sixth win
on the trot,'' recalls McLeish with understandable nostalgia.
There is a very simple, maybe simplistic, answer to the difference between the
Motherwell of last season and of this. They can't score goals and, no matter
how hard any team or manager tries, success in the game is a tough exercise if
no-one can put the ball past the opposition's keeper.
McLeish had thought he might have improved the performance level by switching
personnel, bringing in new players like Shaun McSkimming, Eddie May, and
Dutchman Mitchell van der Gaag, and letting Steve Kirk and Paul McGrillen go.
All his new men have been injured, two of them, van der Gaag and McSkimming,
missing out for lengthy periods. In fact, the Duchman has not yet got his
career in Scotland moving, and a variety of injuries, most notably to Chris
McCart and Tommy Coyne, has further depleted the manager's selection choices,
and in the end left what was a confident, resourceful side struggling without a
win for their last eight matches.
McLeish remembers thinking of McCart as a serious challenger to his own
position in the Scotland team, but his progress has been halted because of a
succession of injuries.
``At this time last year we had scored 31 goals,'' says the manager, ``compared
to 13 this year. If we had scored even a third of the 18-goal difference we
would probably be in about fourth place.''
McLeish, as a player earning a record for a defender of 77 caps, was not the
type to search for excuses, and is no different as a manager, but he puts
forward these statistics as evidence that the line between high and low in this
league is thin indeed.
``I had a friend over from Belgium recently who had no knowledge of our league,
but he pointed out within a short time of being here in some amazement that two
wins can take a team from the relegation zone to a place in Europe. That is
just the way it is and the only way out for us is to be ruthless in front of
goal.
``Coyne is very badly missed because he is a natural goal-scorer, a `sniffer'
in front of goal. The lads we have here have been playing well enough but are
inclined to want one more stride before shooting, but if they can't do the job
soon then a new striker will be essential. I have a list as long as your arm,
but I am sizing up two or three on a regular basis, all of them British.''
McLeish invariably gives the impression of being so laid back that football
set-backs are merely lines interfering temporarily with the picture. That would
not be an entirely accurate version of the situation, because McLeish hurts,
but mostly inside.
``Nobody enjoys criticism and I am no different, but I was getting stick from
some supporters last season when we were finishing second, so it was bound to
be worse now. The most disturbing thing is that the crowds have begun to
dwindle, although we have a tremendous hard core who are immensely supportive.
``I did feel a lot of negative vibes in myself early on in our bad run, but I
think that was because I had not experienced it before. I felt rock bottom when
we lost to Partick Thistle and I was really down for the next few days. I
wondered if I really showed it, but one or two people pointed out that I
shouldn't let the players see that. I realised they were right and decided:
bugger it, I won't be like this again. Now I am upbeat about our chances of
getting out of trouble.''
It was about then that Ferguson offered his advice, adding: ``You don't
appreciate what it can be like until it happens, do you?'' Now he does, and
believes he is the better for it.
``I believe I am a stronger man because of it and will be a better manager as a
result. I used to see it happening to managers and think: that must be
terrible, but you can't really understand it until you experience it.''
He has made up his mind that, when confronted by media questions that may be
loaded towards a pessimistic answer, he will respond as positively as he can.
``Of course, deep down this is hurting me and I am embarrassed, but the minute
we turn the corner and the lads relax and play as they can, they will start to
move up the table. There is a lot to play for yet but our target now must be
consolidation in the league.
``The `fan' letters are coming in at a faster rate these days, of course, but
not all of them condemnatory. ``Actually it is quite surprising how many
letters of support I am getting, telling me to stick with it and try to keep
the team playing the way we want. That means a lot.''
He admits that one of his problems is transmitting a mental toughness to
players, the kind of resolution that helped Aberdeen win games when they were
not playing well.
A couple of decent scorelines could make a lot of difference, but in the long
run Motherwell will have a man with a tougher hide and an even tougher mind
ready to lead them back to the higher echelons of the game.

IN 1996 the Registers of Scotland Executive Agency alters its character: it
acquires trading fund status. And so now, at last, it will reap the rewards of
five years of trailblazing activity - work which has culminated in the
implementation of an innovative system of digital mapping for the Land Register
of Scotland.
So successful has this system been, that the Land Register of England, which
years ago abandoned the process of converting its registers to digital mapping
because it was too difficult, is once more considering the same step.
The Registers of Scotland Executive Agency was until 1990, a part of the
Scottish Office. It is responsible for a number of registers: sasine, land,
personal and deeds among others.
The Sasine Register was established in 1617 to provide for the recording of
deeds as evidence of title to land or property. But the recording of a deed in
it does not mean the Keeper of the Registers certifies its validity. The
disposition which gives details of buyer and seller and a description of the
property, the documents which create securities or burdens on it, and the chain
of former deeds must all be examined before a good title can be established.
This repeated examination of numerous titles in every transaction is expensive
and time consuming. So in 1979 the Land Register of Scotland was set up. This
provides a system of registration of interests in place of the recording of
deeds in the Register of Sasines, and it gives guaranteed titles to land or
property. Unlike the Sasine Register, it is based on a title plan, which is
derived from the Ordnance Survey map.
And this is where the digital mapping comes in. By the early nineties Ordnance
Survey maps were being produced digitally. At the same time, the Registers of
Scotland had undertaken a strategy study to examine its future.
It was clear the Land Register (which is progressively replacing the Sasine
Register) could gain enormous benefits from the increasingly popular geographic
information systems. Land registration procedures could be vastly speeded up,
much more information could be stored, and access           to it could be
immensely improved.
Steps towards the installation of the Land Register's computerised mapping
capability began in 1993. The aim was to acquire a system which could load from
the Ordnance Survey map, produce an index map, check boundary lines, confirm
title positions in relation to surrounding titles, then draw a new, accurate
and detailed title plan.
Fife was the first county to go on-line with the completely computerised
system. Since March this year, every time     a property there changes hands,
the digitised mapping process allows the automatic retrieval of the right
section of the map. Then the boundaries can be ``lassoed'', further details and
measurements drawn in, boundary lines coloured and information highlighted
where necessary. Finally, grid references and all the information, along with
the textual title, are stored in the data base for instant retrieval.
This computerisation has involved an immense amount of effort as each property
changes hands for the first time. Gradually, however, the replacement of the
laborious hand-drawn mapping methods, the extension of digitised titles to the
whole of Scotland, and the eventual transfer of all properties from the Sasine
Register will result in a thoroughly efficient service. This will benefit
everyone with an interest in land or property.
The goal of the Land Register team is to have the whole of Scotland digitised
and transferred by 2003. However, long before then, with its new freedom to
trade and to keep its profits, rather than hand them over to the Treasury,
Registers of Scotland has plans to market its services more widely.
A project called Scotlis - Scottish Land Information System - is investigating
various commercial options. The vast amount of land information relating to
ownership, planning, local authority orders and so on which it possesses could,
for example, be combined and made available. There is the possibility of
producing an on-line reference service for solicitors.
Meanwhile, as more properties come on to the data base, the immediate benefits
of the new system are enormous and obvious. They include speedy access to
information, the sophisticated mapping functions which allow alterations, and
the fact that the contents can be examined by a number of people at the same
time.
And for weary conveyancers, the colourful computer screen could not represent a
more dramatic alternative to the tedious examination of dusty bundles of deeds.

<HEADLINE>Baboon marrow transplant for Aids man</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974864436</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
San Francisco
A MAN dying of Aids went past the point of no return today, receiving an
experimental baboon bone-marrow transplant that might save his life.
Jeff Getty received the baboon marrow during a half-hour infusion, the
culmination of a two-year legal battle for permission to become the first
person to undergo the procedure.
``He's doing very well, feels very good, is up and talking and actually is
making jokes,'' Alice Trinkl, a spokeswoman for San Francisco General Hospital,
said after the operation.
Earlier, 38-year-old Getty underwent a final round of radiation treatment that
knocked out what was left of his immune system. ``It's about time,'' Getty
said. ``I'm lucky to still be alive.''
Getty, an Aids activist and former policy analyst at the University of
California, had fought to win permission for the highly experimental surgery.
The transplant was carried out by researchers from the University of California
at San Francisco and the University of Pittsburgh, as a group of supporters
kept vigil outside the hospital.
In August, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the surgery despite
warnings from scientific advisers that the procedure would probably kill Getty
and could spread baboon diseases to humans.
Human bone marrow contains stem cells that manufacture disease-fighting immune
system cells. The Aids virus destroys this system. The transplant idea arose
because baboons, for reasons that scientists do not understand, do not get
Aids. The theory is that the Aids-resistant baboon stem cells will take root in
Getty's bone marrow and produce immune-system cells that can fight the disease.
Getty underwent drug and radiation treatments this week to destroy virtually
all of what is left of his own immune system to prevent it from attacking the
bone marrow, which otherwise would be perceived as an invader.
Those radiation treatments all but ensure that he will die from Aids-associated
infections if the transplant fails.
The results of the transplant will not be known for several months. Jerome
Zack, a virologist with the University of California at Los Angeles Aids
Institute, is concerned that the treatment could potentially spread baboon
diseases to humans. Aids, for instance, is believed to have originated in
monkeys and mutated into a virulent human disease.
The Humane Society of the United States condemned the surgery. The baboon that
supplied the bone marrow was killed because scientists monitoring the
transplant required a large number of samples.
``Baboons, who are highly intelligent, social and emotional animals, should not
be killed for such highly questionable experiments,'' said Dr Martin Stephens,
vice president for animal research issues.-Reuter.

HAMPDEN Park, the old ground which hosted the greatest ever European Cup final,
between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960, is all set to take its
place again among the great stadiums in the world.
The biggest step of all came yesterday when Hampden was given a #23m Millennium
Commission grant, thus turning on the green light for the completion of a #51m
redevelopment of Scotland's national stadium. When the Hampden plan is
completed in two years' time, it will be given five-star status by UEFA and
again be eligible to stage matches of the highest calibre.
The latest move also opens the door for the SFA to move from their present
headquarters at Park Gardens to the new Hampden, a move which has already been
discussed - and for the Scottish League to ``flit'' from their premises at West
Regent Street in Glasgow. Queen's Park, however, will remain the owners of the
stadium.
Hampden's traditional south stand is to be demolished and replaced by a 16,000
state-of-the-art stand by 1998, and it is there that the men who administer the
game in this country are expected to base themselves.
The new work will raise the capacity of Hampden to 52,000 and will include a
museum, media centre, and sports injury clinic.
The Earl of Dalkeith, the Millennium Fund Commissioner who announced the grant,
said: ``This is tremendous news for the people of Scotland. The new national
stadium will envelope the rich heritage of Hampden Park with an unrivalled
range of modern facilities for sporting events and gatherings of all types.
``We have no doubt it will become a potent symbol of pride for Scotland's
national sport for the twenty-first century.''
He added that the #23m grant was ``the largest single lottery grant in Scotland
so far.''
Austin Reilly, of the Hampden Stadium Committee, said: ``This is a marvellous
gesture of support for the national stadium and we can only thank the
Millennium Commission.''
Reilly said that funding to take the project up to #51m would come from the
Scottish Office, the European Commission, the Football Trust, and the local
authorities, Stratchclyde Region and Glasgow District. A debenture scheme is
also to be launched for supporters.
He added: ``I'm very confident the whole financial package will drop into
place. We have only to clinch deals to match what the Millennium Fund is
putting in.''
Jim Farry, chief executive of the SFA, said: ``Scotland and Hampden are
definite success stories these days, particularly at a time when we have so
much negative news around.
``We cannot expect to please all of the people all of the time, but the
Millennium commissioners and others associated with this project deserve a
sincere thank-you from all sporting-minded Scots for this confident investment
in our sporting future.
``Also a thank-you to all those who purchased Lottery tickets and those
responsible in the Government for ensuring the successful introduction of the
National Lottery.''
The Hampden project is expected to be completed early in 1998 in time for
Scotland to stage the European youth championships at under-16 level.

THE workforce of the troubled Monktonhall pit will gather in a miners' club in
Midlothian today to secure their jobs and end the uncertainty that has
surrounded their pit since they each invested #10,000 to re-open it three years
ago.
More than 90% have already intimated support for a #15m lifeline from Waverley
Mining Finance which will see the miners' consortium pass control to the
Edinburgh-based company.
The buy-out, expected to be rubber-stamped today at the Dalkeith meeting, will
mean new equipment committed to the colliery, allowing the opening of a new
coal face and the creation of around 80 new jobs.
The miners will each get a shareholding which they must retain for three years.
Mr John Richards, chairman of Monktonhall Mine-workers' Ltd, said after a press
conference, at which Waverley Mining released details of a statement issued
earlier to the London Stock Exchange, that the mood of the workforce was ``very
positive''.
``Of course they're sad but that's an emotive remark. They're sad because they
wanted it to be their own company,'' he said in Edinburgh.
Two years ago, he stated, he had spoken of two great resources - one being the
coal and the other the men.
``The third ingredient we required was money. Now I think we have all three
ingredients together - natural resources, human resources, and cash - in the
pot together.''
Mr Richards agreed it was ``with the gift of hindsight'' a lost cause from the
outset because they never had the required capital.
``If it had not been for Waverley Mining, the company would have been sunk
without trace and so would have all the coal, resources, and the employment.''
Waverley Mining Finance chairman Roy Shephard said they were giving the
workforce a great deal of dignity back.
``There is dignity in being at work and almost none in being out of it. They
can boast to their friends and colleagues on Monday that they are now
shareholders in a gold mine.''
British Coal closed Monktonhall in 1987 but the miners' consortium reopened it.
However, it quickly ran into financial problems and Waverley came in with a
rescue package in 1993.
Now, with this share offer about to be approved, it will be investing about
#15m in the mine.
Mr William McLucas, Waverley Mining Finance chief executive, said: ``The
company expects to receive the funds on Monday at which time they will be
making investment in Monktonhall and committing to buy the new equipment
essential to achieve two-face operation at the pit.''
``We wouldn't be there to invest in Monktonhall had it not been for the efforts
of the mineworkers to get the pit started,'' said Mr McLucas, who spoke of
accumulated losses of around #11m.
``Mining is about large-scale investment. It's not about small-scale equipment
when you are operating in a large and complicated colliery. We would not be
spending #15m if we didn't think it was worth it.''
He said the scale of resources at Monktonhall, in which 30% of the company's
total mining assets are now invested, was very substantial.
``It will see me past my sell-by date. We intend to be in business a long time.
What we need to be able to do is to supply the coal at a competitive price.''

Under the Moon, Martin Hayes (Green Linnet)
q The fiddling son of a fiddling father (who joins in on one set of jigs),
Martin Hayes has quickly earned a reputation for putting the tune before the
technique, a delicate approach that makes his carefully rationed slides and
slurs all the more potent.
Recorded in his native County Clare with apposite, well-scrubbed guitar and/or
accordion accompaniments, this is Irish fiddling at its most poetic, with a
bow-bouncing Foxhunter's Reel reminding us that Hayes in hooligan mode also can
be pretty awesome.

DR Guthrie's call (December 14) for uniformity in naming one's offspring
recalls the Victorian approach where the first son was named after his paternal
grandfather, the first daughter after her maternal grandmother, etc.
This meant that a couple had to have a number of children before being able to
name one on the basis of personal choice.
The alternative was to call the child by a different name from that registered.
In three generations of my late mother's family there were four Helens
christened who were known as Annie, Daisy, Nell, and Eleanor.

GLASGOW yesterday witnessed the second coming of Christ.
It was truly a historic occasion, and not without a touch of Glaswegian
malapropism. As the new glass-fibre baby Jesus - cost #600 - laid down his
sweet head, one young voice began singing ``A wean in a manger''.
Glasgow's original baby Jesus was stolen more than a week ago from the city's
George Square Nativity scene. The theft was not an opportunist prank as the
glass-encased scene is kept locked and the thief must have used heavy-duty wire
or bolt cutters to cut the lock.
The figures in the Nativity scene, which originally cost #16,000 when
commissioned in 1988, were made in clay and then cast in bronze-effect glass
fibre. The thief may have thought it was valuable bronze but would have
realised his mistake when he lifted the life-sized sculpture.
The theft allowed newspaper headline writers a field day of dreadful puns,
which included ``Jesus Heist'' and ``Halo, halo, halo''. Despite the continuing
publicity, there has been no trace of the original model.
Even an impassioned plea for information from no less a figure than Mr Pat
Lally, the council leader, failed to move the stony hearts of the culprits.
And lo, it came to pass yesterday that the second Jesus was laid in his manger,
again completing the Nativity scene which includes Mary, Joseph, the three wise
men, three shepherds, a donkey, ox, sheep, and an angel.
Glasgow Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall said: ``It was very disappointing to learn
that someone had been so mean minded as to steal the original baby Jesus
sculpture and sad that despite all the publicity we were unable to recover it''.
However, seasoned Nativity watchers will have noticed that the born-again
Christ looks slightly different.
``He looks completely different this time round because we couldn't remember
the first design we used six years ago,'' said the original creator, sculptor
Andrew Scott.
This time, the council is taking no chances. A security camera of the type used
to watch errant motorists is being trained on the manger night and day.

United Nations
THE UN Security Council tonight authorised Nato to take over peacekeeping
operations in Bosnia.
The council's move legally allows Nato to deploy the new 60,000-strong
Implementation Force, known as IFOR, in its peace mission code-named Operation
Joint Endeavour
The Nato command had been waiting in Brussels for this green light from New
York to start pouring the troops and tonnes of weapons and ammunition into
Bosnia in the biggest military movement in Europe since the Second World War.
They are expected to start moving within days.
The resolution includes ``all necessary measures'' to ensure the peace
agreement'' signed in Paris on Thursday and negotiated in Dayton, Ohio last
month. This is UN shorthand for use of force.
However, the resolution does not explicitly call for Nato to arrest those
indicted by a war crimes tribunal.
Meanwhile, winter weather in Bosnia is seen as a mixed blessing.
It will make deployment of troops much harder, but at the same time fighting
has faded over the past three winters so the troops have less chance of walking
into a fresh flare-up.
Troop contributions range from 20,000 from the US, to 13,000 from Britain and
10,000 from France to 2000 from Russia and just 22 from Luxembourg.
Other countries such as Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the
Baltic states, Malaysia, Pakistan, Egypt and Ukraine will among them provide
around 10,000 troops.
Alliance diplomats said Nato's 16 member states had learned some hard lessons
from the Bosnian conflict, which had forced it to reinvent itself in the
aftermath of the Cold War.
Britain's commander of Nato ground troops in Bosnia said he expects peace but
is prepared to fight.
``We are not going to war. We are going to implement a peace. We are going
there to implement their peace,'' Lieutenant General Michael Walker told a news
conference at ARRC - Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps - headquarters
in Germany.
The general said he expected to be in his new headquarters in Sarajevo by early
next week if ordered to move this weekend.
Gurkhas will fly to Bosnia in their first operational deployment since the
Falklands conflict. An advance party of the Nepalese troops will leave on
Sunday to be followed shortly afterwards by the remaining 100 soldiers whose
task will be to provide security and protection for divisional
headquarters.-Reuter/PA.

Nigerian gas
deal signed
LAGOS: A consortium of four foreign companies signed a contract yesterday to
build a huge liquified natural gas plant in Nigeria despite the controversy
over the hanging of nine minority rights activists in the area.
Nigeria LNG Ltd said in a statement that with the signing of the contract the
final phase of the $4 billion project to utilise Nigeria's vast gas reserves
had started. Anglo-Dutch giant Shell and Western oil firms involved in the
project have rejected worldwide pressure to abandon the scheme in protest over
the hangings last month of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others in the
Movement for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples.
Simpson claim
LOS ANGELES: O.J Simpson's former girlfriend Paula Barbieri claimed that she
called him to break off their relationship only hours before his ex-wife and a
friend were murdered last year, a lawyer said yesterday. The model made the
claim during a pre-trial deposition in the wrongful-death lawsuit filed against
Simpson by the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman, according to Michael Brewer, a lawyer for Goldman's mother.
Salinas move
GENEVA: The sister-in-law of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
was freed from a Swiss jail yesterday after being arrested in a multi-million
pound drugs probe. Paulina Castanon, wife of Salinas' brother Raul, and her
brother Antonio Castanon were arrested on November 15 after allegedly trying to
use false documents to withdraw funds from her husband's #55m Geneva bank
account.
Dini survives
ROME: Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini survived two nail-biting confidence
votes in his drive to force through a deficit-cutting budget for 1996, but he
faces yet another test next week. ``I hope everyone calms down and that reason
prevails on Monday too,'' the technocrat premier, who was in Madrid at a
European Union summit, told reporters after yesterday's votes.
Bodies found
SANTIAGO: Chilean police yesterday dug up the bodies of two men believed to be
left-wing activists kidnapped after a 1973 military coup. They found the bodies
buried together after receiving an anonymous phone tip that workers kidnapped
after the 1973 coup were killed and buried at the spot in the northern city of

Whitewater vote
WASHINGTON: Setting the stage for a constitutional confrontation, a United
States Senate committee voted yesterday to go to court to obtain Whitewater
notes as the White House denied any similarities to Watergate and vowed
President Bill Clinton would fight the issue on principle.

THERE are roughly 2000 ex-patriot Scots living in and around Paris. Precisely
seven of them, out of the 91 who had paid #60 for tickets, struggled in their
tartan finery through many miles of traffic jams and crowded pavements on
December 1, to the Caledonian Society's St Andrews Night Dinner in the centre
of town.
Some of them took as long as five hours. Unfortunately, the man due to address
the haggis arrived last of all - so late, in fact, that the haggis had all been
eaten. Indeed, it was in the early stages of digestion, so just before the
sweet course a spare beastie had to be ceremoniously presented for a recital of
the Burns poem and the ritual stabbing.
As a few Metros and even the occasional mainline train took to the tracks
yesterday, marking, perhaps, an end to a conflict which has paralysed France,
exhausted and harassed Scots have begun looking back over a whole month without
public transport.
Second last into the St Andrews dinner, for example, around 10pm, after four
hours in traffic jams, was 41-year-old accountant from Hamilton, Tom Dowie.
This former Glasgow Academy man, who has worked in Paris for 15 years, has
spent up to 90 minutes driving a few miles to and from work every day - modest
enough suffering and frustration by recent standards. His English wife Pru,
anxious to get her Stripping of the Willow and other numbers into shape for
December 1, had walked for two hours to a training session with the French
Scottish dance group, Chardon d'Ecosse, only to find herself locked out of the
building, and obliged to walk back again.
Some have been suffering less than others. Printer Willie MacGillivray, 53,
from Brodick, Arran, lives near his work, a business in the southwest Paris
suburb of Boulogne, puts a small bicycle in the boot of his car to get around
on occasional trips into town. His wife walks to work, three of their five
children use the bicycle, moped and lifts in a boyfriend's car, while daughter
Fiona has been staying with a friend near her school and the youngest son,
Andrew, walks to primary school.
``There's a bit of Dunkirk spirit. Because things are difficult, people are
determined to resist. My wife and I come into town every Sunday for church and
attendance at the Scots Kirk, which has around 90 members, has actually been
about 25% higher than usual since the strike began,'' Mr McGillivray said.
Investment banker Ian McLeod, 49, from north Ayrshire, who lives in the
southern suburb of Clamalt with his Glasgow-born wife Marion, has been taking
over two hours for the seven-mile drive to work. One evening, they even spent
half an hour driving the first 150 yards out of his bank's garage.
``Some colleagues have been spending up to four hours each way, every day, but
attendance among staff has been excellent,'' he said. ``The strike has had a
disastrous effect on productivity in secretarial work, with people having to
leave mid-afternoon in order to get home and look after children. ``I set off
around 7am and drive back at 8pm. It's a lottery every day as to how bad the
jams are. Christmas shopping has obviously been postponed,'' he added.
One of the angriest Scots in Paris is George Mutch, 48, from Keith, who has
worked in Paris for 24 years and teaches English in Paris Lycees to academic
high fliers preparing university entrance.
``I have trudged hundreds of miles over the past month,'' he said. ``I'm on my
fourth pair of Westons, and I feel like sending the bill to union leader Marc
Blondel. He ought to be the most hated man in France.
``Monday, with three hours walking for four hours teaching, is the worst day.
But I feel my life is in danger - kids on roller skates and motorised scooters
on pavements have been the biggest hazard, but I refuse to be beaten. Why
should we give in? We're being held hostage for a strike which is unjustified
and unjustifiable.''
Wouldn't a bicycle have made things easer? ``There are no bikes to be had in
the shops in my area. The best they could manage was a build-it-yourself kit
from Italy. I had no intention of turning my house into a construction yard''.
A 43-year-old Inverness-born painter, Mr Fred Crayk, who has been working in
Paris for a year, has found the strike exciting. ``The sense of stress is
incredible,'' he said. ``This strike brings out the primitive extincts from
under the civilisation. I witnessed a medieval style battle between cars at a
street corner yesterday and people slamming into each other, getting out and
hurling abuse.
``I have been walking miles to appointments in galleries and getting there
late, and paintings I have been posting to London have been taking ages to get
there. I nevertheless support the workers 100%. It's interesting, in these
post-industrial times, that there is still a spirit among working people to
preserve their basic social rights.''
Fellow artist Calum Fraser, 39, from Edinburgh, whose studio is in the flat he
shares with his girlfriend Sophie, is philosophical.
``I walk a lot anyway, and Sophie teaches at a school within easy walking
distance, so the strike has not been much of an inconvenience, although it is a
bit of a drag.
``Everybody seems to be enjoying it in a way, leaving work after lunch and
putting signs in shop windows saying they're closed because of the strikes. The
chaos on the streets is almost theatrical. Red lights used to be more of a
suggestion than order for Paris drivers. Now they don't give a damn.''

I READ with regret about the imminent departure of Frank Pignatelli from the
service of Strathclyde Education Department coinciding with the inception of
the new unitary authorities in April, 1996.
As a school parent in Strathclyde, I would commend the director for the many
noteworthy contributions he made in order to effect improvement in the quality
of education offered in our schools.
I would single out in particular his initiative in setting up the Parents'
Consultation Group on the Curriculum of which I am a member, after being
successful in the ballot necessitated by the high level of interest amongst
parents.
Mr Pignatelli recognised the fact that parents are the prime educators of their
children and have unique views on the way they are being taught and cared for
in our schools.
The group meetings afforded ordinary parents the opportunity to discuss their
views and concerns with Mr Pignatelli as the most senior manager of the largest
education authority in Europe. It may surprise most parents to note that their
children spend only one-ninth of their time during the year at school and Mr
Pignatelli always emphasised at the PCGC meetings that parental input was
essential to enable all youngsters to acquire literacy skills and achieve their
full potential.
I would also like to mention the director's commitment in ensuring to the best
of his ability and with the resources available that all children were able to
have access to the education system regardless of their parental social status
or home address, with particular reference to children having special
educational needs.
I am in no doubt that wherever Mr Pignatelli's future lies his reputation will
go before him guaranteeing happiness and success.

A WATCHDOG's plans to allow BT to raise bills by as much as it likes were
yesterday condemned as ``astonishing'' by Labour.
Shadow Consumer Affairs Minister Nigel Griffiths said millions would be
``horrified'' by proposals from the regulator, the Office of Telecommunications
(Oftel).
The Consumers' Association also said it was very concerned at the idea.
Oftel director general Don Cruickshank, however, defended his plans. He said BT
was facing increasing challenges from cable firms and argued that competition
would be enough to keep prices in check.
``I feel . . . it is now an appropriate time to lift the constraint,'' he said.
At present, BT has to limit any increases in its exchange line rental charges
to the inflation rate plus 2% a year.
Mr Cruickshank went on: ``This would give BT freedom, if they chose, to adopt a
much more imaginative approach to the way they price services, particularly for
residential customers.
``I believe BT would use this freedom to introduce a family of price packages
and customers would choose which package suited them best.''
Mr Griffiths was far from convinced. ``This year, Oftel allowed BT to increase
its line rental charges at nearly double the rate of inflation,'' he said.
``The millions of senior citizens and others will be horrified at the prospect
of unlimited increases.
``Yet again, the regulator is giving the green light to BT to increase this
very profitable element.''
CA officials have long complained that competition has failed to dent BT's
domination of the domestic market.
Senior researcher Colin Meek said: ``We are very concerned that BT might use
this opportunity to increase line rentals, which for many consumers is the
largest part of their bill.
``Any increased freedom for BT must be matched with greater responsibility to
ensure that no consumers lose out. BT is already in a position to offer far
more and far better packages to the public.''
BT had been asking for some time for more flexibility in charging packages to
allow it to tailor bills to customers' needs.
A BT spokeswoman said: ``We welcome the fact that the regulator recognises the
range and scope of competition that is now in the market place allowing him to
relax controls.''
Oftel's plans will be subject to consultation before they become reality.

q.THE phrase, poacher turned gamekeeper, could sum-up the happenings at East
End Park this afternoon, with poacher Andy Smith, keeper Andy Rhodes, and the
game league leaders Dunfermline against Airdrie. Smith, known as supersub in
his days with Airdrie, will be on the bench for the Fifers today with the
chance of playing for the first time since August, when he broke a small bone
in his right leg during a friendly.
Rhodes, whose former clubs include Dunfermline, has been bought by Airdrie to
cover the long-serving John Martin, who finally has had to give second best to
a leg injury which has been niggling him for months.
Dunfermline will keep the side who took four goals off Dundee last week, but
Airdrie will miss the suspended Steve Cooper and Sean Sweeney.
Dundee play host to St Johnstone with manager Jim Duffy back in the squad after
injury. Dundee also add Craig Tully and Darren Magee to a pool who will be
missing Paul Tosh, Jim Hamilton, and Gary McKeown because of suspension, and
Roddy Manley and Neil McCann through injury, while Saints, with Kevin McGowne
suspended, have Danny Griffin and Stuart McCluskey in their pool.
Dundee United travel to face Greenock Morton without Ray McKinnon and Maurice
Malpas because of injuries and midfielder David Hannah also is doubtful.
St Mirren have been hit by a flu virus, which will mean a late decision for
their line-up to face Clydebank at Love Street. Bottom clubs Hamilton and
Dumbarton square up at Firhill, with both in need of the points to pull
themselves closer to the main pack.

FIGURES issued yesterday by the Association of Chief Police Officers in
Scotland show that there is a drop in the percentage of drivers who failed or
refused a breath test over the first 18 days of the latest drink-drive campaign
(December 13).
This is splendid, but are the figures true? How are they compiled?
At 8am on December 7 I was delayed at the Bearsden end    of Maryhill Road by a
long  tail-back of cars caused by a police check at the roadside.
They were not checking for exhaust emissions; unpaid road tax; or stolen goods.
They were stopping drivers of cars and buses in the morning rush hour, midweek,
on their way to work for signs of drink.
One report said the police had breathalysed 267 drivers, none of them positive.
Just what they expected?
Is this really in the public's best interest? I think not, but it could well be
an easy way to massage the statistics in order to achieve a favourable result.

THE underlying aims of people, prosperity, and partnership, set out in the
White Paper on Rural Scotland, echo the Scottish Secretary's promise to empower
local people.
The proposals were widely welcomed yesterday.
Critics, however, asked where the resources were to turn them into action, in
the light of budgetary cuts this week to Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and
Islands Enterprise, and Scottish Natural Heritage.
Lord Lindsay, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries, and the Environment, wants a
Scottish Rural Partnership to provide the tools for communities to work towards
realising their ambitions. Its main components would be partnerships to bring
together at local level all the agencies with responsibilities in rural areas;
a National Partnership Group to co-ordinate support and assistance to the these
local partnerships; and a #2.5m fund made up of #1.5m existing grant assistance
schemes and #1m of new money.
Other features of the White Paper include a scheme to reduce the burden of
rates on shops servicing isolated communities, new research on rural crime, the
management of small schools, the use of the planning system to open up new
business opportunities, reviews of indicative forestry strategies, and natural
heritage designations.
Rural Forum, Scotland's alliance of rural communities and organisations,
welcomed the document. Its chairman, Ms Deirdre Hutton, said: ``Rural Forum has
always argued that the challenges facing rural Scotland could only be addressed
effectively if rural people were given the lead, supported by public
authorities working closely and properly co-ordinated.''
However, she warned: ``The White Paper does not itself address issues such as
poor transport provision, rural homelessness, access by rural communities to
the land and local natural resources, low incomes and social exclusion, lack of
access to opportunity for young people, and the many other problems confronting
rural Scotland.
``It does, however, provide a mechanism that should make this easier. The key
to the success of this new mechanism will be the commitment of the local
partnerships.''
Mrs Ray Michie, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: ``It gives no
indication as to how local authorities are going to pay for the promised access
to woodlands and no immediate methods for tackling the housing problems which
are as acute in rural areas as in the towns.''
The SNP's rural affairs spokesman, Mr Rob Gibson, said that until Scotland's
feudal landholding system was swept away, Scots would have no influence on what
happened to their land.
The Scottish Landowners' Federation welcomed the emphasis on the need for
economic prosperity in rural areas, and the recognition of rural areas as a
working landscape, and the NFU in Scotland welcomed plans to simplify natural
heritage designations.
Mr Stuart Housden, the RSPB's director in Scotland, said: ``The proposed
agricultural conservation scheme, if suitably targeted and funded, could help
meet biodiversity conservation objectives, launched earlier this week by
Ministers. However, the White Paper is vague as to the resources available and
scope of the scheme.''

A PREGNANT woman and her two-year-old child were attacked in their car as they
waited at traffic lights, a court heard yesterday.
Stirling Sheriff Court was told the attack, on September 18, happened at a
junction on a main road in Stirling's Raploch area, which has one of the
highest crime rates in Central Scotland.
Procurator-fiscal John Miller said Paul Rothwell, 25, appeared to be crazed by
drugs when he staggered into the road as the woman and child, who cannot be
named for legal reasons, waited for the lights to turn green. He was shouting
and swearing and he stepped in front of their car and raised a baseball bat as
if he was going to smash the windscreen.
Mr Miller said a passer-by distracted Rothwell and the woman managed to get her
car into gear.
She ignored the red light in her panic and started to drive off while trying to
shield her child who was fastened in the front passenger seat.
As she did so, Rothwell struck at the passenger door next to the child and
again at the rear of the car, before running after the car as the woman drove
away. A car behind had to drive round Rothwell, who flung his bat after it.
The court was given no explanation for the attack.
Rothwell, of Weir Street, Raploch, admitted vandalism, placing the mother and
child in fear, and resisting arrest.
In a separate incident, he admitted assaulting his father at his home at Weir
Street on December 11 and punching him repeatedly about the head and body. He
also admitted causing a breach of the peace outside Stirling Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Robert Younger remanded him in custody for reports until January 5.

PREMIER ROUND-UP:
CELTIC hope to continue their recent impressive form when Falkirk visit
Parkhead today as the premier division reaches its half-way stage.
``We have the chance to put some extra psychological pressure on leaders
Rangers if we win,'' said Celtic assistant manager Billy Stark. ``If we collect
three points we would be just one point behind them when they play Motherwell
next week. It may only last a couple of days but we would like to do that.''
Celtic's play has been impressive of late and, as Stark added: ``It will be
difficult for us to improve on the performance the team gave against Hibs last
week. Tom Boyd has been suffering from a touch of flu but he has been training
over the past few days and we're hopeful that he will be able to face Falkirk.''
Malky McKay will continue as the replacement for the suspended John Hughes.
John Lambie, the Falkirk manager, returned from Spain to Brockville yesterday
still involved in negotiations to bring a player from there to join his club.
``I am still involved in negotiations about a player in Spain,'' said Lambie.
``That's all I can tell you. We're still hoping to do something but it would
have been good if we could have brought him back and played him in this game.
We will have the same squad as last week with big Kevin James added to it.''
Another man who could be joining the ranks at Brockville is Partick Thistle's
Albert Craig. The 33-year-old was club captain when Lambie was in charge at
Firhill, but appears to have fallen from favour under new Thistle manager,
Murdo MacLeod.
Now Lambie was said to be keen to take Craig to Falkirk and MacLeod admits
there has been contact. ``There is an ongoing situation with Albert,'' said
MacLeod. ``He's not in the team at the moment and a swop deal has been
mentioned. We'll have to wait and see what develops.''
Thistle travel to Rugby Park today to face Kilmarnock and MacLeod knows what to
expect. ``Killie had a great result against Falkirk last week. They are a team
capable of causing problems and Tom Brown is playing well.''
Another club playing well is Aberdeen, who take on Hearts at Pittodrie. Manager
Roy Aitken, seeking a third successive home victory, admitted: ``Hearts have
changed personnel by adding a cosmopolitan touch which has strengthened their
squad.
``However, it is what we do which concerns me. I have been happy with the
progress we have made this season. I have set a pattern of play but it is not
rigid. They are allowed to express themselves, show flair. But there is
improvement still to be made, particularly in off-the-ball situations. I want
us in possession as often as possible.''
``We need a third win to consolidate our league position and must produce the
right attitude and determination again for it will be a tough match.''
Captain Stewart McKimmie is suspended along with transfer-listed midfielder
Peter Hetherston. Striker Scott Booth is again missing with a thigh injury and
Brian Grant will take over from McKimmie at full back.
The last time Raith Rovers played Hibs, Jimmy Nicholl's side won 3-0 and it is
for sure that Hibs will be out for revenge at Easter Road this afternoon.
Success would take Raith to within three points of Hibs, who sit above them in
fourth place in the premier table.
Raith are the surprise packets of the division so far this season, their
impressive form having taken the Kirkcaldy team into the top half of the table
following promotion.

WHENEVER politicians talk about education they seem to do so as if it were a
commodity produced by investment that could be bought with money, and as if
schools consisted only of teachers and officials.
Recent reports on the extent of smoking, drinking, and drug-taking among school
children are surely enough to remind us that schools are largely what their
pupils make them.
Neither money nor legislation can make all schools equally effective so long as
the homes and communities from which their pupils come vary as drastically as
they do.
Neither paying teachers more nor sacking them as inefficient can alter the
truth recently pointed out by a parent and teacher: ``The biggest single factor
in pulling down educational standards is not underfunding, but the millions of
teacher hours wasted on destructive pupils''.
I have yet to hear of any politician usefully addressing that problem.

RANGERS have been prevented from hosting a European football final because
there is no room at the inn.
Ibrox had been in line to stage the European Cup Winners' Cup final on May 8
next year but a lack of available hotel beds in the Glasgow area for the match
led UEFA yesterday to award it to Brussels.
A spokesman for Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and Convention Bureau said last
night about 2000 beds had already been booked for a cardiologists' convention
in the city between May 7 and 9, taking up nearly two-thirds of the 3000 four
and five-star rooms the city has at the moment.
He said: ``May also tends to be a traditionally high-occupancy period for
hotels in the city, with the rate running at about 70%.''
Mr Campbell Ogilvie, secretary of Rangers, said the club was obviously
disappointed by the news, announced by UEFA in Birmingham.
He said: ``Last week, when we heard we were in with a strong chance of being
considered for the match, we contacted both local hotels and hotels within the
Scottish central belt as we were fully aware that it was imperative that a
maximum number of rooms in top-class hotels were required.
``We also heard last Friday that a major international convention was being
held in Glasgow between May 7 and 9, 1996.''
Mr Ogilvie added: ``We have been assured by UEFA that this was the only
stumbling block in our bid and that UEFA themselves are impressed by Ibrox and
the operation of the stadium.''
q.The Olympic Stadium in Rome will stage the European Cup final on May 22 next
year.

DAVID Sole, the 1990 Grand Slam captain suspended from all involvement in rugby
until the end of the season for bringing the game into disrepute, does not
regret making the comments which led to one of the most severe bans handed down
by the Scottish Rugby Union.
``I certainly regret the furore that developed around my comments and the fact
that the whole issue seemed to get caught up in other people's agendas, but I
do not regret making the comments which were made in the heat of the moment
after a crucial game.''
Sole who retired in 1992 after having captained Scotland on a record 25
occasions in major internationals, later becoming assistant coach at Edinburgh
Academicals, is sorry for the inconvenience and embarrassment caused to his
club by his ``tantamount to cheating'' remarks.
Details of the ban were announced yesterday by the Scottish Rugby Union after a
disciplinary hearing at Murrayfield on Thursday night. The severity of the
suspension has taken many observers by surprise.
The affair has dragged on for five weeks since Sole made the now infamous
observation on the performance of Kelso referee Colin Henderson after
Academicals' premiership game against Melrose.
Henderson awarded nine penalties in succession against Academicals, and Melrose
won with an injury-time try which placed the now relegated Academicals deeper
into the mire.
The Union's initial attempt to stage a disciplinary hearing was sidelined when
Sole said he could not attend because he was babysitting. Club officials
appeared, and Sole made a written submission to Thursday's hearing whose
verdict, strangely, was predicted 12 hours in advance by a media report.
The SRU acted against a backdrop of a situation which was spiralling out of
control. Referees, with international official Ray Megson in the vanguard, were
threatening to boycott Raeburn Place until the situation had been resolved.
It is not the first time Sole has been out of favour with the SRU. In fact
there has been little love lost between the former Scotland captain and certain
members of the Union. His early retirement was precipitated by the comment by a
senior SRU man that he was a ``cancer at the heart of Scottish rugby.''
Yesterday's statement from Murrayfield declared: ``The sentence reflects the
SRU's policy of providing the fullest support for referees and the absolute
priority to promote good behaviour on and off the field. Concern was expressed
that, despite opportunities being given to appear at a meeting, and to
apologise to the referee, David Sole was unable to attend a meeting, but gave a
written explanation and has not apologised to the referee.''
Sole said yesterday: ``Nothing surprises me. At the end of the day, the
suspension hurts the club more than it hurts me, and that saddens me. I'm
involved not just with the 1st XV but with the under-21 side and the mini and
the midi-sections on Sundays. To that extent the decision is going to have a
significant impact on the club. I wonder if I'm still allowed to watch my son
playing mini-rugby.
``In my letter to the Union, I said I regretted that my comments had received
such widespread coverage in the media. The SRU say that I have not apologised
to the referee. Well, it's a small but significant point, but I was never asked
to apologise to him.
``I had an inkling that the SRU would do something rather small-minded and,
maybe, some people will think that their action comes into that category. Since
I retired as a player, I have tried to give something back to the game but I am
not going to be allowed to do that now.
The ban, which runs until May 11, means that Sole will not be able to coach
Academicals during their Cup campaign. He is banned from acting in any capacity
as player, coach, referee or touch-judge.
Privately yesterday, senior officials of the Academical club, one of the
founder members of the SRU, were furious at the severity of the sentence and
threatening resignation. They will respond officially next week.
Sole had disassociated the club from his comments and the club had told the
Union that they did not condone what their assistant coach had said.
Henderson, and Megson, who is scheduled to referee Academicals' game against
Edinburgh Borderers on Boxing Day, had no comment to make.

WHAT a year 1996 has been for movies with a Scottish theme! Looking back, 1995
was only the start - on the back of Rob Roy and Braveheart, Hollywood went
Scotland crazy . . .
Good news in January of 1996, with word that Braveheart Two: The Return was set
to go into production. Directed by James Cameron, The Return combines
thirteenth-century history with twenty-first century science. A scrap of
Wallace's DNA is found encased in aspic, scientists clone the DNA, re-creating
Scotland's greatest patriot. Using the technology of time travel, Wallace is
sent back, accompanied by his new best friend (Danny Glover) to change history.
The pre-release publicity for the movie says it all: ``They disembowelled him,
they chopped him into bits - but now he's back, he's pissed off and it's time
to kick some English ass . . .''
March - and Quentin Tarantino secured the option to remake Whisky Galore. In an
interview with Premiere Tarantino recalled: ``I just thought these Scottish
guys were so cool, heisting all that Scotch. But this time I figure we should
bring it up to date y'know. Less of that gentle teasing of authority shit, more
like the villagers really fall out over it y'know. And there's this big scene
where they cover each other with their shotguns and like, it's a stand off
y'know and then bang! And that guy, the butler guy in Upstairs Downstairs, well
he doesn't take all the shit his Mom's laying on him, he just takes his 44
magnum and she's history!''
The legend of Sawney Bean attracted the interest of Martin Scorsese. The
director, announced in April that he would produce the movie of the family's
story. Scorcese's favourite actor, De Niro, is already preparing for the role
of ``Pa Bean'' with his usual thoroughness.
Scorcese told the press: ``I was over at his house for dinner the other night
and the meat on the plate? I swear to God I thought it was pork, I tell you I
was shocked when Bobbie told me and y'know, Bobbie being Bobbie he just
laughed, the way he does.''
Few actors are bigger than Tom Hanks in Hollywood so his decision to star in
The Mike Forsyth Story came as a surprise. In May, on the Letterman Show, Hanks
explained what had attracted him to the story; ``Here's this guy OK? He's the
head guy for this political party that no-one in Scotland likes. And he goes to
England to help his new buddy, John Major, and then, one day, he says, `No
John, I gotta go back to Scotland, the people need me,' so Mike Forsyth comes
back to Scotland and he tries to be friendly with everyone and they all say `Go
Away! Get out of here!'
``Anyone else, they'd leave right? But not Mike, he smiles, he walks around in
public, he won't leave. I mean, Forrest Gump was just a story right? but this
guy's for real . . .'' John Major will be played by Michael Caine.
George Lucas is the prime exponent of the mythic hero genre in Hollywood. Think
of his Star Wars trilogy, the Indiana Jones movies, all with strong heroic
characters capable of transcending common sense notions of reality prepared to
risk everything in the pursuit of an impossible dream. Fergus McCann: The
Search for the Biscuit Tin began filming in June.
Keanu Reeves optioned Speed Two in July. This time he battles to keep the speed
of the bus up to 5mph on the M8 between Townhead and Charing Cross.
Finally, in September, Arnold Schwarzenegger optioned Gavin the Barbarian a
biopic based on the life of the erstwhile captain of our national rugby team.
Acting as consultant to the production, Gavin was characteristically effusive:
``I've read the script and it's really quite good . . .''

BRUCE McKain, your Law Correspondent, is mistaken in his report on Mr Mohammed
Al Fayed's legal action relating to Balnagowan Castle in Easter Ross (December
12)
Balnagowan is most certainly not ``the seat of Clan Ross'', and has not been so
since a hereditary chief occupied it - and that was 1711 when the thirteenth
and last Baron of Balnagowan died. He, like myself, was a descendant of the
thirteenth-century Earldom of Ross.
While Mr Al Fayed's contribution to the preservation of Balnagowan as a
property is widely recognised, he most certainly has no connection whatsoever
with Clan Ross whose ``seat'' is where this Chief now is; and that is elsewhere
in Scotland, a country in which I am proud to live on a permanent and full-time
basis.

RAIL privatisation will press ahead despite a court judgment which threw the
franchise plans for some services into confusion, the Government insisted last
night.
The Save Our Railways pressure group won a partial victory at the Court of
Appeal in London in its challenge to proposals for seven initial franchises,
including InterCity East Coast.
Campaigners said the ruling would force a rethink of the minimum levels of
passenger service required of franchises throughout the entire rail network.
Labour leader Tony Blair immediately issued a fresh call for the Government to
scrap rail privatisation.
He said: ``This is a hammer blow to the Government's plans. We have warned them
time and time again that this privatisation would not work, that the broken
promises would catch up on them, and the public simply would not tolerate the
destruction of the railways.
``Ministers should take the hint and admit defeat. They should realise that the
longer they press on the more damage they will do to themselves and the
railways.''
However, franchise director Roger Salmon insisted ``passenger rail franchising
is proceeding on schedule'' and was backed in this by Transport Secretary Sir
George Young.
The court ruling is complex but basically means that the Save Our Railways
(SOR) campaign has won part of its case. SOR had challenged the legality of
franchising proposals for the first three lines to be sold off: Great Western,
South West Trains, and LTS (London, Tilbury, and Southend) Rail.
It had also challenged plans for the next four: InterCity East Coast, Network
South Central, Midland Main Line, and Gatwick Express.
Last week, High Court judge Mr Justice Macpherson had cleared Mr Salmon of
accusations that he had unlawfully set minimum passenger service levels at too
low a figure.
Yesterday, however, three senior judges, led by Master of the Rolls Sir Thomas
Bingham, overturned the Macpherson ruling in relation to the second tranche of
lines. They ruled that Mr Salmon had failed properly to base minimum passenger
service levels for the sell-off on the current BR timetable, as he had been
instructed to do by former Transport Secretary John MacGregor.
On a technicality, the judges paved the way for Mr Salmon still to proceed with
the sale of the first three lines, ruling that there had been undue delay in
SOR launching its application for judicial review with regard to these.
The overall judgment left it clear for both sides to claim a victory of sorts,
though the balance of the argument seemed to lie with SOR.
Sir George Young said the court's rejection of the challenge to the first
tranche of franchises ``allows the franchise director to proceed with these and
I hope he will be in a position to do so.''
He added: ``So far as the other franchises are concerned, we will, of course,
be giving careful consideration to the court's judgment.
``This judgment does not affect the timing of Railtrack's flotation next
spring.''
The second set of franchises will probably now be sold off in the spring but
only after the minimum service levels have been revised.
Mr Salmon said: ``I welcome the Court of Appeal's rejection of the challenge to
the first group of three franchises. The decision allows me to proceed with
these sales and I expect to make announcements shortly.''
He said he was confident that the details on the first three franchises ``will
show the benefits that franchising will bring to passengers''.
He added: ``The court has given us leave to appeal against the decision in
relation to the further four franchises. We will be giving careful
consideration to this and to the other options available to us. Today's
judgment means that passenger rail franchising is proceeding on schedule.''
However, SOR secretary Keith Bill said: ``We have had a tremendous victory
today which will bring great benefits to rail passengers the length and breadth
of the country. The whole of the Government's rail privatisation process has
been thrown into chaos and they will have to think again.''
Mr Bill said SOR intended to take the matter of the LTS Rail ruling to the
House of Lords on Monday: ``We want the Lords to prevent any sell-off of LTS as
the Court of Appeal today said the line's PSR (Passenger Service Requirement)
had been formulated in breach of Government instructions.''
Shadow Transport Minister Brian Wilson called for the sacking of Mr Salmon and
said: ``The court ruling is wonderful news which confirms the reckless way in
which Ministers have been pursuing the dogma of rail privatisation. They should
now throw in the towel.''
For the Liberal Democrats, transport spokesman David Chidgey said: ``As
predicted, rail privatisation is proving to be the Government's poll tax on
wheels. It is time for the Government to think again, admit they are wrong, and
put the interests of the travelling public before party dogma.''
Mr Salmon had hoped to announce the names of winners of the bidding for both
South West Trains and LTS Rail last Tuesday. A separate announcement about
Great Western was due shortly afterwards.

Stagecoach.

Elizabeth Buie examines a new initiative aimed at tackling the problems which
blight many rural areas
AT THE touch of a button yesterday, the Government's policy document for rural
Scotland was sent across the country on the Internet computer system.
Any villager, from the Borders to John O'Groats, could have read the Scottish
Office's new initiatives to solve the problems of rural unemployment, crime,
and conflicting land use 40 minutes after the White Paper had been presented to
Parliament - provided, of course, they had the necessary technology.
The Earl of Lindsay, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and the Environment in
Scotland, had picked the ideal location for the launch. Strathyre, a few miles
north of Callander, had its own tele-cottage, an award-winning village shop,
charming hotel and pub, and fine landscape.
The problem in Scotland is, however, that not all rural areas are so fortunate.
Many, particularly the former mining villages, are blighted by unemployment.
Others have inadequate transport systems and are in danger of losing their
local schools.
Where jobs do exist, too often they are poorly paid and do not match up to the
educational qualifications or aspirations of rural dwellers. Communities such
as Assynt may have the enterprise and vision to invest in computerised links,
but many remain untouched by the technology revolution.
The new policy document Rural Scotland: People, Prosperity and Partnership has
as its main plank devolution of more power to local communities.
The Government hopes to achieve that empowerment of communities by establishing
another quango, the Scottish National Rural Partnership, and a number of local
partnerships whose membership and composition will reflect each individual
community's needs and interests.
It has also created a new Scottish Rural Partnership Fund to provide
pump-priming assistance to local partnerships. Its #2.5m budget includes #1.5m
of existing grant assistance and #1m of new money. Its objectives will be to
bring together a number of existing small-grant schemes relevant to rural
Scotland; to offer financial support to projects proposed by local rural
partnerships on behalf of communities; and to part-fund the initial costs
incurred in developing local rural partnerships.
While the initial funding level is acknowledged to be pretty frugal, Lord
Lindsay said he hoped that future spending rounds would release more money. And
it is on this thorny subject, money, that the Government's proposals attract
most criticism.
George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, pointed to the
fact that the Cumnock and Doon Valley area had suffered a 28% decline in
population between 1981 and 1991. Recent visits to Highland towns such as Fort
William and Strathpeffer had shown them to be relatively prosperous, largely
due to the Highlands and Islands' EU Objective One status.
With cuts of #33m to Scottish Enterprise's budget for training and employment
initiatives, how could towns in rural Ayrshire and Wigtown expect to revive
their fortunes, he asked.
``This will all be window dressing unless they have the resources behind
them,'' he says.
It was a comment echoed by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations,
which, along with a variety of other organisations, agencies and quangos, will
sit on the new Scottish National Rural Partnership body.
SCVO director Martin Sime warned that the voluntary sector will be looking for
assurances that funding now available to rural charities and voluntary
organisations will not be lost through being redirected via the national
partnership fund.
There were some concrete measures outlined yesterday: a scheme to reduce the
burden of rates on the village shop; proposals for a Rural Business Use Class
in the planning system; changes in tax assessment for rural business units;
guidance on how to improve rural development and employment opportunities; and
a new duty on water authorities to take account of the interests of the rural
customer.
However, only time will tell whether the new partnership mechanisms are up to
the task of tackling the real countryside problems of transport, homelessness,
access to land and natural resources, low incomes, and social exclusion.

IN an impassioned appeal to the undecided, the indifferent and the angry,
President Boris Yeltsin today warned Russians not to vote for hardliners who
want to return to a totalitarian past.
``We don't appreciate what we have until it's gone. Freedom is like that,'' he
said in a nationwide television speech. ``It's like air. When you have it, you
don't notice it.''
Yeltsin's speech amounted to an 11th-hour attempt to prevent the expected
success of the Communist Party in Sunday's elections for the 450-seat State
Duma, the lower house of parliament.
``You should not allow the forces of the past to come to power again,'' he told
voters in a clear reference to the communists.
Although Yeltsin has stayed out of the election campaign, the results will be
seen as a rough referendum on his rule and a dress rehearsal for next summer's
presidential poll.
Russians are angry about the loss of their social safety net, at how inflation
has eaten up their savings and turned pensions and salaries into small change.
They are fed up with crime, corruption and Yeltsin's bloody war in breakaway
Chechnya.
q Russian troops today regained control of Chechnya's second city, Gudermes,
after Defence Minister Pavel Grachev threatened a ``no-nonsense'' response to
rebel attacks.
Russian forces all but sealed off the capital Grozny to ensure independence
fighters did not also infiltrate the battered Chechen capital in a campaign
apparently aimed at disrupting elections in Chechnya.-AP/Reuter.

The Herald's regular team of reviewers listen to the best sounds around
The Original American Decca Recordings, Ella Fitzgerald (MCA)
q If your finances won't quite stretch to Ella's four-CD, 80-track Ella - The
Legendary American Decca Recordings, then search out this single-CD
distillation. It covers the years 1937 to 1954, when she was working firmly
within the context of pop, and is an absolute stoatir. As well as being
accompanied by her own Famous Orchestra, the First Lady of Song is captured
with such notable sidemen as Louis Armstrong and Louis Jordan. Buy this and
then begin saving for the full works.
Pulp Surfin', various (Del-Fi)
q After having fallen in love with Dick Dale's awesome guitar-power on the Pulp
Fiction soundtrack, the rest of the world has at long last caught up with
Scotland's own Beat Poets, lone disciples of surf-rock toot'n'twang for almost
a decade. This collection will please California wave-catchers of all vintages,
whether they reside in California or, like the Beat Poets, Strathbungo. It
utilises classic tunes from Del-Fi's sixties archives - Pipeline by the Lively
Ones; Night Prowler by the Deuce Coupes; Link Wray's Rumble - as well as
offering new directions in beatily-poetic instrumentalising.
Dig the timeless sound of today's Insect Surfers! Marvel at the ongoing musical
rehabilitation of surf-guru Brian Wilson on In My Moondreams, in which the
erstwhile Beach Boy is assisted by Andy Paley. There's also a Frank Zappa
novelty track from 1963 (Letter From Jeepers) and the Bobby Fuller Four
performing the aforementioned Dick Dale's reborn hit, Misirlou. Tune in, turn
on, twang up!

WE are coming up to the end of the year, the traditional time for investors to
look back on how their investments have performed and work out strategies for
the next 12 months.
This year was difficult to predict but turned out well. And the market tipsters
are scratching their heads again for inspiration about 1996. On the plus side,
we have inflation that is low and looking likely to stay that way. The world's
economies are slowing down but are still predicted to grow allowing company
earnings also to rise.
David Kern, chief economist at the NatWest Group, is looking for OECD growth of
2.4% next year, the same as this, and 2.5% in 1997, but he expects EU growth to
turn out at 2.7% for this year, down from 2.9%, and drop to 2.4% next.
The Chancellor has forecast the UK economy should grow by 3% next year, but
City economists are pitching their expectations below that - some even below
2%. All that should keep interest rates low. The crystal ball gazers at top
stockbroking firms have been predicting little change next year although the
end-year estimates range goes from 5.75% to 8%.
Given this relatively unexciting economic backdrop, the UK investor has to
recognise that sooner or later the home market will become heavily influenced
by politics.
Not even John Major can be sure of when the General Election will be.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's Budget last month seemed a clear indication the
Conservatives plan to hang on pretty much to the 1997 limit.
While the tax changes were seen by some as a move in the right direction, they
failed to stir the blood and must have been intended as no more than a curtain
raiser to a much more jolly affair next year. But this week has seen the
Government's majority cut by one through the death of a Tory MP.
Stockbroker Merrill Lynch points out that the Government could well lose its
majority towards the end of next year. Two to four Conservative MPs could,
statistics suggest, die every 12 months. That would leave Mr Major with little
choice but to have an autumn poll.
If, however, the Government still has a majority of two or more by then, the
broker expects it to soldier on, producing a tax-cutting Budget in November and
having a spring election in 1997.
In the short run, investors who have their money in shares probably need to
keep their eyes on the progress of the world's economies in case the slow-down
goes too far.
At some stage, it is logical to suppose the approach of an election must affect
decisions. Wholesale nationalisation of privatised utilities by a Labour
Government is highly unlikely, but there has been talk of a windfall tax on
electricity profits. The investment trust analysts at NatWest Securities
comment: ``The odds must be on higher personal taxation on higher earners.''
This has implications for the investment trust industry. The high earners are
the people most likely to be fuelling the rise in retail demand for investment
trust shares, so the industry needs to increase its efforts to ``package''
shares into tax-efficient products such as personal pensions.
The analysts also question whether a Labour Government would leave personal
equity plans intact. It is unlikely to abolish them retroactively, but new PEPs
could be abolished or, more likely, restricted.
Whether or not Labour does this, it would seem sensible to make sure you have
taken up this year's full allowance of #6000 for a general PEP and probably
also the #3000 for a single company version before the end of the tax year and
also take up the 1996-97 allowance as early as possible.
So far as investment trust shares are concerned, they comment: ``Investors are
likely to want to have more money overseas if Labour gets in. This will benefit
the trust industry since it will stimulate demand.''
They suggest buying the shares of large liquid overseas-based trusts should be
an excellent each-way bet.

THE upper house of the German parliament voted unanimously today for a complete
ban on imports of British beef because of fears it could be contaminated with
``mad cow disease''.
But Health Minister Horst Seehofer rejected the demand by the Bundesrat and
told it the issue might have to be settled in court.
The EU has ruled that British cattle born after 1992 are free of BSE, or bovine
spongiform encephalitis, and can be imported.
A temporary directive from the Bonn government implementing the decision
expires in February and needs Bundesrat approval to be renewed and made
permanent.
But the Bundesrat said today that it wants a general ban on British beef. In
addition, it said beef imports from other countries should carry a document
certifying them fit for consumption under German law.
``The Bundesrat emphasises that the recent development of BSE has shown that
the risk of BSE infection re-mains,'' the upper house said. Germany says there
is no proof that BSE cannot be transmitted to humans.
Seehofer warned members of the upper house that their move would result in
illegal actions which could be followed by compensation demands in the EU.

calves which damns the use of crates. EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said
the report was aimed at allaying public fears.-Reuter.

THERE was no hint of turmoil, not even a frisson of ``what if'' emanating from
the stony, imposing exterior of the Royal Bank of Scotland`s Edinburgh
headquarters yesterday.
While the rest of the financial community buzzed with the unconfirmed notion
that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation might be poised for a
takeover of the Royal, the bank issued a brief statement insisting, a little
ambiguously, that they were not in discussion with any potential bidders.
``We have made our position clear for a long time now,'' said a spokesman
later, ``and we believe the interests of our shareholders, our customers and
our staff are best served by our remaining an independent financial services
group headquartered in Edinburgh.''
That at least was welcome news for the many who believe the bank must stay at
the core of an independent Scottish financial sector.
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond, who was an economist for the Royal
when HSBC launched its first takeover bid in 1981, was suitably adamant about
what stance should be taken.
``A takeover of the Royal Bank would be damaging to Scotland,'' he said. ``I
don't think a takeover by HSBC would any more work in 1995 than it would have
worked back in 1981. The Royal, by and large, has been a success story,
certainly through the 1980s, and it should stay an independent Scottish
institution. I think Scottish opinion should be martialled in favour of
retaining the independence of our financial sector.''
Rumours have been swirling around the Royal for a number of months now, with
speculation that both it and the Bank of Scotland could be in line for a
friendly takeover. In 1981, moves on the Royal by both HSBC and the Standard
Chartered banking group were nixed by a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
inquiry.
Many believe a takeover would be an unfortunate transformation for a bank born
out of a spirited but flawed Scottish attempt to colonise Panama during the
closing years of the 17th century.
The new colony of Darien failed in 1699 with the loss of many lives and
one-quarter of Scotland's liquid assets, and the Royal Bank emerged from a
complicated system of compensation payments from the English, who had withdrawn
their support for the new community. The new bank officially opened for
business in Ship Close, Edinburgh, 268 years ago this month.
It has carried with it a reputation for innovation, initially inventing the
overdraft in 1728, and in the 1980s launching the phenomenally successful
Direct Line Insurance offshoot.
In the same decade, the bank diversified further by moving into the somewhat
dicey US market, buying the Citizens Financial Group of Providence, Rhode
Island. This year, Citizens saw its pre-tax profit increase by 57% to #107m.
The Royal Bank group's profit before tax last year rose by a total of 13% to
#602m, the highest in the bank's history.
Royal Bank spokesman David Appleton said yesterday that the bank was in a
strong position because it had diversified and gone for a range of different
business opportunities which had become significant profit generators.
However, industry analyst Chris Ellerton, of SBC Warburg, said he believed the
Royal was in a relatively difficult position in the consolidating UK market.
``The theory is that large-scale, high-volume, low-cost producers are going to
win the day and the Royal Bank is neither particularly high volume nor
particularly low cost. It is stuck in the middle ground. The outlook for growth
at the Royal Bank for the next year or two is not that exciting and a lot will
depend on Direct Line's ability to develop other lines of business outside the
insurance market.''
Alongside its drive to explore different options, the Royal has initiated a
major restructuring programme, Project Columbus, which earmarked a total of
3500 job losses in retail banking and brought them into direct conflict with
staff and unions. If the 80s were characterised by innovation, then the 90s
have been years of employee turmoil.
The banking union BIFU says the restructuring is savage and has targeted older
members of staff. Around 2000 jobs have already been shed within the branch
network.
``Quite frankly, I don't think the interests of the staff have been on the
agenda at all,'' said BIFU's Scottish deputy general secretary, Sandy Boyle.
``A recent survey shows that morale has totally collapsed. Only about 17% of
the staff believe in the executive. We're also seeing now quite blatant ageism.
As far as we're concerned, hardly anybody under 50 is getting a job. We're
looking at a workforce now where less than a quarter are 40 or over. That's
very, very worrying in the long-term.''
BIFU doesn't think any possible takeover would be good news for staff or
customers, but Chris Ellerton doesn't think anyone can view the bank as a
business waiting to be bought.
``It's not a lame duck; it's a very highly valued bank and before any bid
speculation was there it was a bank trading two and a half times its book
value. If someone wants to buy the Royal Bank of Scotland they will have to pay
a significant premium.''

YOU can keep your Chaplins and your Harold Lloyds: as far as I'm concerned,
there was only one comic genius of the silent period of cinema - the great
``Stone Face'', Buster Keaton.
Keaton, the youngest of this trio, was born a century ago - in the same year as
cinema; the medium which offered his talents the chance to go far beyond
vaudevillian slapstick and which was repaid with some of the most memorable and
widely imitated sequences that have ever been filmed.
Keaton was born Joseph Francis in Kansas on October 4, 1895, to a vaudeville
act called ``The Two Keatons''; his parents, Myra and Joe. They worked as
members of the Mohawk Indian Medicine Company - a travelling vaudeville show.
At the age of six months he emerged unscathed from a fall down a flight of
stairs; a tumble that so impressed the legendary escapologist Harry Houdini
that he nicknamed the baby ``Buster'' - stage slang for a pratfall.
Before his first birthday, Buster got his first laugh, albeit inadvertently,
when - to the delight of the audience - he crawled onstage during his parents'
act. He didn't get the chance to perform in a theatre again until 1898, when
his mother finally, and reluctantly, agreed to allow him to join the act.
``The Three Keatons'' were hounded by the Gerry Society, an organisation which
aimed to protect children from exploitation, because their act depended on
Buster being thrown around and treated like a human punchbag. For the finale,
Joe would catapult his son, who was dressed as a miniature version of his
father, into the percussion section of the orchestra pit.
Through necessity and experience he trained himself to fall without seriously
hurting himself and learned how to prevent himself from registering emotion no
matter what disaster had befallen him, since he noticed early on that ``the
more serious I was, the more laughs I got''. So was born the frozen-featured
comic character that his name would come to represent in the movies.
In 1917, Buster broke up the family act, partly because he was now too big to
be thrown around and also because Joe Keaton had begun drinking and was
occasionally dangerous onstage. (On one occasion he misjudged a kick and struck
the back of his son's head. Buster was unconscious for 18 hours.)
Shortly afterwards, Buster - a dedicated movie fan - happened to meet Roscoe
``Fatty'' Arbuckle, at that time the second most popular comedian after
Chaplin. Keaton turned down a prestigious engagement worth $250 per week at the
New York Winter Gardens in order to work for Arbuckle's Comique Studios for
less than a fifth of that amount. The two men hit it off instantly, and proved
to be a perfect match onscreen in at least 15 films.
The first thing Keaton did when he began to collaborate with Arbuckle - whom he
later described as his ``greatest influence'' - was to take apart a camera and
figure out how it worked. After only two years in the film business, Arbuckle's
production supervisor, Joseph Schenck, bought Keaton his own studios and with
them went the unspoken invitation to let his imagination run riot. Keaton
proved to be a revolutionary, pioneering and downright classy filmmaker: his
production values were always high and he regularly, and flawlessly, made use
of innovations such as split screen in his short films, none of which were
based on scripts.
In 1923, Keaton made his first two feature-length films: Three Ages - a parody
of D W Griffith's Intolerance - and Our Hospitality. The latter featured the
kind of daredevil antics that would normally persuade a star to call on the
services of a stuntman, but Keaton insisted on doing all his own stunts. So
much so that in Our Hospitality he narrowly escaped being swept away by rapids
(the sequence is captured on film and his near-drowning can be seen in the
finished product). The following year, while filming Sherlock Jnr, he hit his
head on a railway track. More than a decade later, a doctor asked him when
exactly he had broken his neck.
Sherlock Jnr was described by a critic of the day as lacking in ``originality
and ingenuity'' - actually two of its strongest features. The story of a cinema
projectionist who steps into the screen while a movie is playing, it predates
Woody Allen's similarly-plotted The Purple Rose of Cairo by 61 years, and - as
a recent, rapturously-received, screening with live musical accompaniment by
the Paragon Ensemble in Glasgow testified - has not only withstood, but
triumphed over, the test of time.
Keaton's best-loved film was made in 1926. The General was his most spectacular
and costly work to date. It was the last movie over which Keaton had more or
less complete control. It went over budget and opened to mixed reviews, so
Schenck told him to work with a production supervisor on his next project. Just
before Keaton completed Steamboat Bill, Jr, Schenck advised him to join MGM.
This proved to be a catastrophic move which - in hindsight - heralded Keaton's
decline. Unfortunately, it was coincident with problems at home: his wife was
spending money faster than he was earning it, and she was trying to alienate
his sons from him.
Keaton's second movie for MGM, Spite Marriage, proved to be the last one with
any vestige of the ``Keaton touch''. The restrictions of working within, and
being answerable to, a tightly structured studio were stifling his creativity.
MGM committed a crime against comedy by effectively killing off the comic
personality that Keaton had taken a lifetime to establish. The studio forbade
him from carrying out dangerous stunts (crucial to his character); made him
abandon physical comedy in favour of spoken gags, and even subjected him to the
indignities of being a song and dance man (in Free and Easy).
Keaton had been sucked into the studio system which spat him out, drained of
originality. By 1930, personal and professional frustrations had led Keaton to
the bottle. Over the next decade, he made lousy films in a continuous drunken
haze; split up with his wife; married his nurse (without remembering he had
done so); became a gambler and - possibly worst of all - was forced to play
sidekick to comedian Jimmy Durante.
In 1937, faced with the choice of abstinence from alcohol or death, Keaton -
now on hard times - re-invented himself as a humble gag writer for the Marx
Brothers, again at MGM. But it was another marriage - in 1940, to a young
dancer called Eleanor - that probably prevented a relapse: ``It transformed my
life,'' he said. Over the next 26 years, Keaton gradually won back fans he had
lost and his silent comedies found new audiences as they were given a new lease
of life by film restorer and distributor Raymond Rohauer.
By the time of his death in 1966, Keaton's stone face had been re-established
as one of the cinema's true icons.
Alison Kerr makes a case for the brilliance of Buster Keaton, who for too long
has been in Chaplin's shadow

SKIING:
WHEN the 1995 KPMG Scottish Ski team was launched two weeks ago on a tiny patch
of imported snow in the centre of Edinburgh, little did the squad of five
full-time skiers realise that their crucial pre-Christmas schedule would be so
hit by the lack of snow in Europe that they would have to fly to Canada to get
racing.
With the British National Ski Championships in Tignes, France, advanced by a
month from their usual April slot - to avoid a clash with the financial year
end of sponsor, British Land - the Scottish team need as many races as possible
before facing their fully-fledged British Alpine team rivals under the
selectors' intense scrutiny.
Rival skiers of the British Hanson &amp; Robertson FIS and Europa Cup Teams - the
squads to which the Scots immediately aspire - have been racing hard in
Scandinavia, completely filling the international quota of six starters which
Britain is allowed, thereby eliminating any Scottish team skiers.
The Scots have copied a coaching structure which cost the Canadians millions of
dollars to develop. Since adopted by the Scots, it has become the envy of the
UK, and is likely to be the blueprint when the current wholesale overhaul of
coaching throughout Britain is enforced at the end of this season.
These changes are predicted to bring a return to a system of a British Junior
Team and a British Senior team, and may bypass this current crop of Scottish 17
and 18-year-old Scottish team skiers. They could find themselves ``the lost
generation' - well short of the new qualifying standards for British team
selection, unless they can post some very inspiring results at the British
Championships, but too old for Junior team selection.
French-Canadian coach Chuck Auclair said: ``They are certainly the best
prepared, most hard-working team in recent years. When it comes to the British
Championships, that's when we have to make our mark and beat some of the better
British team skiers - selectors can never discount that.''
The leading Scottish team skiers have already had more than 50 days' on-snow
training, with successful summer and autumn camps in Chile and France - a
preparation which, according to Auclair, puts them on par with the leading
Alpine nations for the first time.
The whole Scottish team this season has been pared back to just 15 skiers,
fewer than half of what it was three years ago, with only five skiing full-time.
Scottish FIS TEAM: Ross Baxter, 17, Edinburgh; Michael Berkeley, 17, Forfar;
Paul-Anthony Cairns, 17, Telford; Ross Gardner, 18, Edinburgh; Ross Green, 16,
Falkirk; Derek McMillan, 18, Kilmalcolm; Finlay Mickel, 18, Edinburgh; Antoni
Pilarski, 20, Falkirk.
Scottish Home Based Team: Blair Aitken, 15, East Lothian; Lorne Noble, 15,
Edinburgh; Amanda Pirie, 15, Aberdeen; Pamela Robb, 15, Aberdeen; Gareth
Trayner, 15, Ladybank; Laura Westmacott, 16, Kirkliston.

Soprano in Red: Lesley Garrett (Silva Classics)
q BLATANTLY nostalgic collection from La Garrett, the soprano who would be a
diva. Collection of old-fashioned, sentimental melters from operetta and
musical. The disc features Ivor Novello's We'll Gather Lilacs and Waltz of My
Heart, Noel Coward's If Love Were All, and selections from Sigmund Romberg,
Offenbach and Lehar (including, of course, the perennial tear-jerker, Vilja
from The Merry Widow). Though there are huge question marks over Garrett's
operatic abilities, she does this stuff - for which there is a huge market -
extremely well. With the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra.

Paris
STRIKING French rail workers voted to return to work today, opening the way for
an end to France's longest public transport stoppage in a decade.
The 22-day strike forced conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe to scrap a
plan to streamline the loss-making state railway and promise not to touch
generous retirement schemes.
But he did not back down on his main welfare reforms, including new taxes and
controls of health service costs in a move to cut France's gaping budget
deficit and help it qualify for the single European currency expected in 1999.
Despite that Communist CGT union leader Louis Viannet insisted: ``The rail
workers' victory in imposing their sectoral demands on the government is a
textbook proof of the force which workers' unity and union unity brings.''
He called for further action but the signs were that the strike was crumbling
among Paris Metro and bus workers and in the state-run power and telecom firms.
The prospect of an end to the strike was greeted with relief by footsore Paris
commuters who endured three weeks of monster traffic jams and long walks or
bicycle rides to work.
Force Ouvriere, the other main union leading the wave of strikes, confirmed
that most of its members had voted to start work again on Sunday or Monday,
after tomorrow's planned mass protest against Juppe's welfare reforms.
The French franc was back up at its highest level since the start of the
crisis, but shares ended lower as investors fretted about the economic cost of
the long stoppage.
As the strikes wound down, rail chairman Jean Bergougnoux resigned, hours after
Juppe disowned him by criticising an absence of dialogue between management and
unions.
Even before the rail strikers voted, trains had resumed running in some parts
of the country and public transport was slowly coming back to life in the
French capital.
``Things are starting to roll a little bit. It's a positive sign,'' Transport
Minister Bernard Pons told Radio Luxembourg, predicting rail services would be
running across the country by Tuesday.
There were scenes of elation when one of the first Metro trains rolled into
Chatelet underground station.
``I never thought I'd be so happy to see a Metro. It's like a dream, a breath
of fresh air,'' said Scheherazade Boudard, 26. ``Paris without the Metro is
hell.''
Symbolising the beginning of the end of the rail stoppage, a high-speed TGV
train left Lille in northern France this morning carrying a mere 10 passengers
to Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport.
The train arrived half an hour late after striking railway workers blocked the
tracks until police could clear them away.
Rail officials said it would take several days to clear rust from the lines and
get the network fully operating, and that die-hard strikers could still try to
disrupt services.
Trade unions said Juppe's plans to overhaul the indebted welfare system, as
well as European Union plans to open public services to competition, threatened
France's public services and working conditions as well as hitting workers in
their pockets.
French Transport Minister Bernard Pons tonight accepted rail chief
Bergougnoux's resignation, but asked him to stay on until a successor was
nominated.
A ministry statement said Pons thanked him and assured him that the government
did not blame him for the strike crisis.
Symbolising the beginning of the end of the rail stoppage, a high-speed TGV
train left Lille in northern France at 6am today, carrying a mere 10 passengers
to Paris's Charles de Gaulle International Airport.
The train arrived half an hour late after striking railway workers blocked the
tracks until police could clear the way.
In Paris, six Metro underground lines ran limited services, RATP said. About 6%
of buses were running.
Postal services were also improving, with just 2% of workers striking and
disruptions at 39 of 135 sorting centres compared to 46 yesterday, the post
office said.
The two main Paris airports operated normally despite a threatened strike by
air traffic controllers, officials said.-Reuter.

PETER Garside recommends the service on the Anglo-Scottish motorway bus and
suggests the InterCity rail service has let him down because of the
fragmentation of the rail service due to privatisation (December 8).
It may also be that the bus operates almost track cost free, only paying a
reduced road fund tax and with a rebate on most of its road fuel tax.
InterCity, on the other hand, operated profitably without any subsidy
whatsoever until privatisation struck.
InterCity West Coast desperately needs its track upgraded but the Government
refuses because it will not provide a commercial return on investment. The
express bus would travel down the new M74 built at a cost to the taxpayer of
several hundred millions. No nonsense about commercial returns here.
The bus, and other road users, do not pay a penny extra for the benefit of this
investment. Elsewhere the Scottish Transport Minister gets excited about a road
bridge over Loch Creran. It will save the motorist 15 minutes. But the rail
bridge at Dornoch, even with mainly European funding, is ridiculed as
uncommercial.
A project to bring passenger train services back to Alloa was about to start
when Government departments decided another #1m was required to give extra
protection to motorists at level crossings. This made it uncommercial and the
project was scrapped.
But 100 yards away the Scottish Office found ``special'' funding of several
millions for a new Alloa road into Stirling. These are not isolated examples.
This is Government policy.
The train operators have to pay track access charges of a few hundred millions
(#170m from ScotRail alone) to Railtrack, which does maintenance which costs
only a fraction of this amount.
If better tracks or upgraded signals are required, then the train operators (or
local authorities) have to fund this themselves as extras. What happens to
those hundreds of millions that Railtrack does not spend on improvements? That
is the ``Profit''.
It is a wonder the trains run at all.

Your questions answered by R E Dundas, Christopher Sims and Angus Gawn
q My wife and I have a mixed bag of investments purchased over the years
through privatisation issues and new investment trusts coming to the market. I
am 59 and in early retirement with an index-linked pension of #20,225 per
annum. My wife is 55 and her income is #35.25 a week. There is no mortgage on
our #90,000 bungalow and we have no debts.
The following portfolio is badly in need of tidying up. It consists of 3000
Scottish Hydro, 425 PowerGen plus 220 part-paid, 695 National Power plus 330
part-paid, 1600 BT, 10,000 M&amp;G Income zero dividend Preference, 3000 Fleming
Emerging Markets plus 892 warrants, 3200 EFM Smaller Companies plus 640
warrants, 1200 Fleming Chinese plus 240 warrants, and 2500 Abtrust Emerging
Economies plus 500 warrants.
We save #100 a month with Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust (#3800 now in
plan) and #30 a month with M&amp;G Recovery Unit Trust (Accum) (10,120 units
purchased to date). We have #9000 each in Tessas and #12,000 in an instant
access building society account in my wife's name with interest paid gross.
Your advice would be greatly appreciated.
n We would agree with your conclusion. Your portfolio needs tidying up. Overall
it is worth #56,000, and by the time the interest is added to your Tessas your
savings and investments will total around #90,000, a substantial sum by any
standards which should be well managed.
Even your privatisation portfolio is heavily weighted towards electricity
shares. New specialist investment trusts do not have the same attractions for
small investors as the more broadly based conventional trusts, where you picked
well with Foreign &amp; Colonial. M&amp;G Recovery is a highly rated unit trust.
You have a tendency to concentrate your fire power with nearly #20,000 tied up
in just two investments, Hydro and M&amp;G Income zero dividend Preference.
You are well placed with your substantial index-linked pension. Your
investments are there to provide you with the icing on the cake as well as a
bit of independence and security. It is for you to decide how much income you
would like from this source and, accordingly, the emphasis that should be
placed on capital growth.
We would suggest that you seek the advice of a good stockbroker who should be
able to provide you with a broadly based portfolio of equities and investment
trusts to suit your financial needs.
q I took out a Scottish Amicable Flexidowment Second Series policy in 1981 with
an earliest maturity date in 1991 and a latest maturity date of 2006. I have
been disappointed by its recent performance and requested a surrender value.
This turned out to be approximately 73% of the total sum of benefit and bonuses
from the bonus declaration of 1994.
It would appear that there is a penalty on the surrender of this policy despite
the fact that it was sold on the basis of having an earliest and latest
maturity date. Am I right in thinking the Flexidowment principle was a sales
gimmick with no particular advantage for the policyholder?
n These policies provided a guaranteed pay-out calculated from a specified
formula from the tenth anniversary onwards. As it happens the standard early
surrender values have not been any worse, but Scottish Amicable says they would
have been had the life fund under-performed.
From the perspective of today, when there are more competing products available
and there has been pressure to improve early surrender values generally, the
Flexidowment guarantee may appear a modest advantage. But in the context of
when you began the policy it was an advance on a standard one in at least
giving a floor to the surrender value. If it was marketed as the answer to the
inflexibility of the with-profits policy then this was an exaggeration.
q I would be grateful for your opinion regarding the Kvaerner offer for Amec. I
do not like the absence of a share alternative. In particular, I would like you
to comment on the cash offer of 100p per share and on the loan note
alternative. Do you feel the cash offer is fair and reasonable and is the
interest on the loan note worth considering?
n This offer closes on Monday and on balance it is worth accepting given Amec's
poor record and the outlook for its industry. While the bid may not be very
generous, Amec shares are likely to fall sharply should it not succeed. The
loan note alternative does not look attractive.
q I have my Tessa with the Dunfermline Building Society and it will mature in
January. The Dunfermline has recently written to me offering the chance to
reinvest the #9000 capital for a further five years at a fixed rate of 7.7%.
While it is unlikely that I will need access to the money, it is not totally
impossible and, of course, interest rates could rise substantially during the
next five years. The penalties which the Dunfermline will impose on early
withdrawal are severe and, in fairness, it says that anyone who is likely to
want to withdraw early should invest in a variable rate Tessa.
As a higher rate taxpayer I find the offer attractive and I'm tempted to take
the chance, but is it too much of a gamble on the interest rate remaining
competitive or could I do better elsewhere?
n No-one can predict what interest rates will do over the next five years but
as things stand, with both main political parties apparently committed to low
inflation and sound money policies, a return to high interest rates is
unlikely. It is more probable that they will fluctuate quite narrowly around
present levels. Based on past performance, Dunfermline's rates are highly
competitive and you are unlikely to do better elsewhere.
If you cash in the Tessa before the five years are up all the interest accrued
since the start becomes subject to tax. As you are a higher rate payer, the
7.7% would drop down to 4.6% net, and there would be the penalties. The current
variable rate is 7.2% which would become 4.3% net.
So the difference is not that great - approximately #27 a year - though the
latter rate would, of course, drop if interest rates in general fell. The final
decision has to be yours, but in your position we would agree with the
Dunfermline's advice.

LABOUR MPs and the Ramblers' Association have accused Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth of hypocrisy over his policy on public rights of way.
Local residents yesterday staged a demonstration at Middleton Hall in
Midlothian, site of the Scottish Prison Service's abortive venture to set up a

They walked through the grounds using ladders to overcome barriers to maintain
a right of way which they say has existed for 20 years.
The SPS, however, denies its existence and says no mention of it will be made
in the expected imminent sale of the mansion and its 113 acres.
The SPS is expected to lose around #1m on the sale of the property, which it
bought for #1.3m in 1989. RA Scottish officer Dave Morris said: ``It is
extremely irresponsible for the Scottish Secretary to be blocking this route in
this way.
``It sets an appalling example to all other landowners in Scotland and runs
entirely counter to his statements.''
Midlothian MP Eric Clarke said: ``What has happened is absolutely scandalous.
This is disturbing not only because of the huge waste of public money but also
the total inconsistency on the part of the Scottish Secretary.''
Labour's Treasury spokes-man, Mr Alistair Darling, said there was now a case
for referral to the Public Accounts Committee. ``The Government is saying one
thing and then doing the other by blocking off a right of way the public is
entitled to use,'' he said.

I WAS horrified to read about the chaos that looms when local authorities have
to collect the water charges.
Many thousands will not pay in protest. If the cash is not collected the local
authorities will have the equivalent amount deducted from their budgets and
therefore from the likes of education, social work, etc.
The water boards get their money, the vulnerable suffer, and the Government,
which set up the legislation, can sit back and laugh all the way to the bank.

<HEADLINE>Ashby libel case QC asks for `substantial damages'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974864476</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE jury hearing the David Ashby libel case should award the MP substantial
damages in accordance with the need to vindicate him, the High Court heard
yesterday.
In a reference to this week's Court of Appeal ruling that judges and counsel in
libel cases can indicate to a jury the level of award they deem appropriate,
the MP's counsel, Mr Geoffrey Shaw QC, said in his closing speech that he would
not avail himself of his new liberty.
The 55-year-old MP for North-west Leicestershire, who is suing the Sunday Times
over allegations that he is homosexual, had been forced to speak about his
marital difficulties, his sexuality, his health, and even his impotence, as
necessary steps towards the vindication he sought.
He had waited almost two years for a courtroom battle with his estranged wife,
Silvana, pitted against him.
``I do say that, if you find for Mr Ashby in this case, it will be your duty to
award substantial damages in accordance with the need to vindicate him.''
He said the jury might have read in the newspapers of public concern about the
level of damages awards. ``But, as Mandy Rice-Davies said, `They would say
that, wouldn't they?' because it's them against whom large awards have been
made.''
Mr Ashby is claiming damages over a January 1994 article which said he shared a
double bed with a man friend during a holiday in Goa at the end of 1993.
Times Newspapers Ltd and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil deny libel,
although they accept Mr Ashby did not holiday with a man in Goa. They assert
that he was and is having an affair with 32-year-old Dr Ciaran Kilduff.
The newspaper's counsel, Mr Richard Hartley QC, said in his closing speech:
``It is our submission that damages do not arise. You do not get damages in
this country for an article which is true and it is our submission that the
evidence against the plaintiff in this case is overwhelming.''
Mr Hartley described the MP as arrogant and pompous - easily upset and hurt
over petty matters - who was misguided and illogical in his decision to sue.
Mr Ashby had said that he had never come across bigger hypocrites and more
dishonest people than the Sunday Times but the jury might think the MP scored
``near maximum points'' on the hypocrisy and lies scale.
The MP had maintained that people would have to have dirty minds to think he
and Dr Kilduff were having a homosexual affair just because they shared a
double bed at Chateau Tilques, St Omer, northern France, during a brief holiday
together in January 1994.
The QC asked the jury: ``I suggest it's an insult to your intelligence and
others to suggest you would have to have a dirty mind to come to that
conclusion.
``If you don't come to that conclusion, you are in the realm of people
believing in Father Christmas or that babies are delivered by storks.''
He added: ``It's clear on the balance of probabilities that he is a homosexual
and he and Dr Kilduff were having a homosexual affair.''
Mr Justice Morland will sum up on Monday.

WORKERS at the loss-making HarperCollins book manufacturing plant at
Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow, have voted overwhelmingly to transfer to a new
company.
About 360 workers had been told the plant would close and that they would be
made redundant unless they agreed to accept changes in working terms and
conditions by 1pm yesterday.
The agreement to accept a 9.5% cut in wages and a compensation package offering
78 weeks of the difference between the old and new rate was put forward by Mr
Chris Hardie, the prospective owner of the plant, and Mr Eddie Bell,
HarperCollins's executive chairman.
Staff previously rejected a 25% wage cut proposed by Mr Hardie, who owns a
small Berwick-based company, Martins the Printers.
In addition to the compensation package, HarperCollins has made ``generous
subsidies'' available to Mr Hardie.
The Graphic, Paper, and Media union, which represents most of the workers,
confirmed that 337 of its members had agreed to transfer. The 20 who refused
would be made redundant.
Mr Hardie's company will take control of manufacturing from Monday, ending
Collins's 175-year association with book manufacturing in Glasgow. The plant is
understood to have lost more than #10m in the past five years.
Mr David Munro, GPMu Scottish branch secretary, said last night: ``While we are
not in favour of cuts in wages and do not believe that the failure of the
HarperCollins manufacturing business was due in any way to the working
performance of our members, we are happy that the employers have now agreed to
operate within legislation adhering to the transfer of undertakings.
``The net effect of the new proposals means that the reduction introduced to
the wage structure will not be felt by our members for 18 months. This now
allows the launch of the new company.''
The union said it was also pleased that book manufacturing would continue at
Bishopbriggs and said it looked forward to a ``long and fruitful relationship''
with Mr Hardie.
Mr Bell said: ``This terrific result has saved more than 300 jobs. We never
shirked from our responsibility to our people. I believe today that the staff
have made the right decision and I look forward to working with Chris Hardie in
the future.''
Mr Hardie was not available for comment.

TWO men died and two other people were injured in a Borders road accident on
the A7 Galashiels to Selkirk Road, yesterday.
Police named the dead men as Mr Charles Clamp, 25, of Crumhaugh Road, and Mr
Christopher Muir, 24, of High Street, both Hawick.
The two people injured were taken to Borders General Hospital. Mr Paul Currie,
21, of Beattie Court, Hawick, received pelvic injuries and was ``stable''. Ms
Jennifer Bird, of Falside, Camptown, Jedburgh, had arm and leg injuries and was
``serious, but stable''.
The accident, near Glenmayne House, happened when the Austin Maestro the four
were travelling in left the road and plunged down an embankment before bursting
into flames.
Ms Bird, who was in the rear passenger seat, was thrown from the vehicle. Mr
Currie, who was sitting next to her, was rescued by a passer-by and police
officers.

Academy Brass, RSAMD, Glasgow
LAST things first. ``And now, the moment you've all been waiting for,''
announced Bryan Allen. ``The big band is unleashed.''
Strangely untrumpeted, the RSAMD brass department yesterday staged the official
debut of its latest creation at the climax of a superb lunchtime concert.
Formed only this term under the aegis of newly appointed head of brass at the
Academy, Bryan Allen, the big band is an 18-piece outfit that got off to a
storming start.
Stronger in ensemble than in solos, the band - powered by mental drumming from
Guy Rickarby - roared through a short series of big band classics: Count
Basie's Jumpin' at the Woodside, Neil Hefti's Cute, and Duke Ellington's
Caravan, among others.
Displaying the muscle of their classical technique, they made mincemeat of the
complexities of Don Ellis's The Last Tangle of Lord Boogie. To say it was an
auspicious start would be to understate.
The entire concert was a virtuoso display of the range of brass talent in the
RSAMD. The brass band played sections from Walton's original music for The
Battle of Britain and a bruisingly confident account of Thomas Wilson's bracing
Sinfonietta, while a sextet of leading players performed Leonard Salzedo's
Divertimento (which contains the Open University theme). The last might have
had a tighter edge if it had been conducted.
The brass department has been a core element of the RSAMD for years; Bryan
Allen has picked up a rich inheritance. The signs yesterday suggest exciting
developments; watch this space.

TWO children watching a new Pocahontas cartoon video saw a pornographic film
flash on the screen.
A supermarket chain yesterday took the movie, which has no connection with the
Disney blockbuster Pocahontas, off its shelves after the girls' shocked mother,
Mrs Debbie Lewis, handed the video to the police.
The #3 cartoon had been taped over a film showing lesbian sex scenes. Trading
standards officers have warned other parents to beware if they have bought The
Adventures of Pocahontas.
Sarah Lewis, 11, and her sister Jodie, nine, watched the movie at their
grandmother's home. Mrs Lewis, 36, of Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, said: ``The
cartoon lasted 26 minutes and suddenly ran straight into these sex scenes.''
The video was sold by supermarket chain Hyper Value, which has 21 stores across
Wales and the West Country. Trading standards officers are now trying to
contact the makers, World Class Entertainment of London.

William Russell
enters the busy world of Stockard Channing
WHAT does an actress do after scoring the success of a lifetime both in the
theatre and on the screen? Stockard Channing, whose performance as Ouisa, the
New York society art dealer in John Guare's play Six Degrees of Separation, was
a sensation on Broadway and in London, has been busy ringing the changes.
Having played Ouisa so successfully she may have found herself facing the fate
of many actresses - being replaced when the play was filmed. But Guare had
written the play for her, and it was she who played Ousia in Fred Schepisi's
acclaimed film version.
In reality, Channing is svelte, dark haired, and as sharp as can be - nothing
like Ouisa. She followed her with the role of the tarty, down-on-her-luck Ruby
in Wayne Wang's Smoke, shown at the London Film Festival, which will open here
next year.
Ruby is completely her creation, because she was allowed the freedom to decide,
on the basis of the script, how she conceived the character. She is a classic
New York broad, a wasp-waisted woman of the world with blonde hair and black
roots.
She has come to New York to try to help her daughter who, she has discovered,
is pregnant, on crack, and living with a junkie pimp. She tries to persuade an
old lover, a corner store owner played by Harvey Keitel, to help, claiming he
is the girl's father.
``Ruby has been round the block,'' Channing says. ``In fact, Ruby has been the
block, there is no doubt about that, so I decided she had to look very bold.
When she walks into Harvey's cigar store she has to make a real impact. It is
an animal thing. She is a female animal in a male den.''
Keitel, who does not like to rehearse but to work straight on camera, was taken
aback when he first saw her. She was not his idea of Ruby. He pointed out he
had a line in which he told Ruby she ``looked like shit,'' yet here was
Channing in high heels and dressed to the nines. Channing insisted no man would
say something like that to a woman's face, although they might think it if they
felt threatened by her.
It is a striking part in an impressive film, and she has followed it with as
varied a selection of roles as any film actress could wish for. They range from
the battered wife, Carol Ann in the drag fairytale, To Wong Foo, to the English
keeper of a bawdy house in the latest version of Moll Flanders, made earlier
this year in Ireland.
While in London in Six Degrees she met Tom Stoppard who, having seen her as
Ouisa, decided she was just the person to play the title role in his espionage
play, Hapgood, in New York. That was a hit and she is now waiting for Stoppard
to come up with a screenplay which Renaissance Films and Channel Four will make
and she and Stoppard produce.
She notes she has gone from Ruby to Carol Ann to the head of MI5, to the keeper
of the whorehouse, finishing up with the part of a newscaster in Up Close and
Personal opposite Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeifer.
She is realistic about the vagaries of the actor's life. If something happened,
that was fine, but certain things were not meant to be.
``You have to let projects go,'' she says. ``As I get older, I realise that is
how life works. I don't talk about something until I am doing it, otherwise it
is just a fantasy. Why torture myself with things that may never occur? There
is no control over things like that. Why go round saying - What is the matter
with me? I never worked with David Lean. You can drive yourself crazy that
way.''
She knows she is lucky; she still has options as an actress, and there is work
lined up, including a film of a Horton Foote play with Mary Stewart Masterton
which should be finished by Christmas. There is also a film with Scott (The
Right Stuff) Glenn and Jennifer Tilly called Edie and Pen to come.

<HEADLINE>Coroner's drugs plea to teenagers: `You don't know what you are putting in your body' Warning after death of boy, 15</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

A CORONER yesterday made a heart-felt plea to teenagers after the death of a
15-year-old boy who took an overdose of ecstasy tablets hidden by his mother's
boyfriend in their home.
Aaron Fairhurst died in hospital at Crewe, Cheshire, in May after being
discovered in his bedroom making grunting noises.
At an inquest in Crewe, coroner John Pollard said: ``I make a plea from the
heart to all teenagers and anyone else tempted to use ecstasy or any other
illicit drugs to bear in mind that you don't know where they were prepared or
how well or badly they were manufactured.
``Quite frankly, you don't know what you are putting in your body. It is a most
foolish and stupid thing to do.''
Aaron's mother, Lisa Fairhurst, 31, and her long-term boyfriend, Gareth
Charles, were regular drug users but have now renounced the habit and yesterday
backed the coroner's warning.
Fairhurst, who is divorced from Aaron's father, told the inquest her boyfriend
had bought the ecstasy tablets for their own use and hidden them in their house
in Davenham, Northwich.
On the night of May 25, she went to bed but heard a banging noise, as if an
object had been knocked over, and grunting noises coming from Aaron's bedroom.
``We saw Aaron with his upper body on the bed and his feet on the floor. His
body was rigid and his eyes were open but rolling back.'' She added: ``He was
soaking wet but very hot, and had all the classic symptoms of an ecstasy
overdose or reaction. I panicked and told Gareth to take him downstairs.''
The couple managed to get him to drink two pints of water and then a pint of
salt water in an attempt to make him vomit, but this did not work and they then
took him in their car to Leighton Hospital, Crewe.
Her boyfriend returned to the house from the hospital and found that his hidden
ecstasy tablets had gone. Aaron was pronounced dead soon afterwards.
Fairhurst said: ``Aaron was the happiest he had been in a long time, so I can't
understand what his motives were to sit in the bedroom and do that on his own
when it is generally classed as a social thing.''
She described how he had suffered from bullying at school in Manchester but
added: ``He was a happy, bright boy, a bit of an extrovert.''
Police Constable Kevin Chambers told the hearing in a statement that about five
ecstasy tablets were missing from the house.
Fairhurst and her boyfriend both pleaded guilty to charges of possession of
cannabis and ecstasy and were placed on probation for six months by Northwich
Magistrates' Court.
Consultant pathologist Dr Ann Nicol said Aaron died as a result of
cardio-respiratory arrest due to an MDMA overdose.
Recording a verdict that Aaron died through the abuse of a non-dependent drug,
Mr Pollard said there was no evidence to suggest that he had been depressed or
suicidal.
``He took the drugs because unfortunately he had grown up in a culture in
Manchester where drugs were frequently talked about.''
After the hearing, Mr Colin Downie, solicitor for Fairhurst and Charles, said
the couple had both renounced the use of drugs and urged all young people to
beware and not to be tempted into taking them.
``Drugs have wrecked their lives and they sincerely hope they will not wreck
the lives of any other unfortunate people.''

THE coming of the Euro as the EU's single currency means Britain - which is not
committed to it - is expected to spend millions of pounds familiarising the
public with the new money, writes MURRAY RITCHIE.
After yesterday's decision by EU leaders to move to monetary union in 1999 the
Government must now decide whether to exercise its opt out from the single
currency in 1998.
The new coins will be in circulation, if all goes as planned, in 2002 - by
which time every EU member state should have prepared its citizens for the
changeover through a vast multi-million pound publicity campaign. But Britain
appears so far to have no such plans.
Comparisons are now being drawn with the publicity blitz which lasted for years
in the run-up to decimalisation of Britain's currency in 1971. Almost seven
years was spent on that campaign.
Now the British appear destined to lag behind the rest of Europe because of the
Government's determination not to make up its mind on the single currency until
the very last minute.
A blueprint for the European-wide campaign was produced recently by the
European Commission. It wants the community's member states to pick up most of
the cost of educating the public on what the Euro will mean to them.

A BRITISH international synchronised swimmer was jailed for two years
yesterday, for offering tablets she believed were ecstasy for sale at a
nightclub rave.
In fact, Louise Skidmore, 22, from Bristol - national champion in 1988, and who
took part in world championships and a pre-Olympic competition in Spain in 1991
- was selling pills which contained no controlled drug. Her co-defendant at
Plymouth Crown Court, Leona Nicholls, 23, who had been living in London, was
also jailed for two years.
Judge William Taylor said: ``I note you were not in fact selling ecstasy,
although you believed you were.'' He told the defendants, who he said were both
of previous good character and in all other respects hardworking and decent
young women, that he regarded the offence as so serious only a custodial
sentence could be passed.
Both women had appeared for sentence having pleaded guilty last month to
offering ecstasy tablets for sale at Oz's nightclub in Union Street, Plymouth,
in April.
Prosecuting, Mr John Bush said although they believed the tablets to be
ecstasy, forensic tests revealed they contained no controlled drug.
Judge Taylor said the pair brought the tablets from Bristol to Plymouth, having
accepted the drugs for sale on behalf of another person in a moment of
stupidity. He told Skidmore, against whom there was no evidence apart from her
admissions: ``Many youngsters look up to you to set an example.''
Mr Bush said the women were in the nightclub on the night of April 28 when, as
a result of something said by a client, two security guards approached them and
said a random drug search was being carried out.
Asked to produce their purses, Nicholls was found to have around #200, and
Skidmore about #100.
They both denied carrying any drugs and the police were called. Nicholls then
told a female security officer she had drugs on her and produced a bag
containing 43 tablets.

A BUSINESSMAN has bet #50 that he will father a child at the age of 100.
Mr John Richardson, 55, says it will give him something to live for and he will
have a lot of fun practising in the next 45 years.
The bet has been taken by William Hill bookmakers who have given him odds of
10,000/1 - meaning he will make #500,000 if he wins.
Mr Richardson says he will advertise for a woman aged between 25 and 35 to give
birth to the child in return for #250,000.
He says he wants the child to be conceived in the ``usual and enjoyable
method'' and is willing to have a blood test to prove it is his.
Mr Richardson, a toy importer, from Hatch End, west London, has four children
aged between 16 and 35, from three wives.
q William Hill yesterday opened its book on bets for 1996. They included one
million to one that Anthea Turner will win #1m on the National Lottery.

SCOTTISH Television has designated Andrew Flanagan, its finance director, to
take over as managing director in May, writes ROBERT POWELL.
He will replace Mr Gus Macdonald who will become executive chairman of the
Glasgow-based ITV station.
Mr Bill Brown, the current non-executive chairman, is retiring.
Mr Flanagan, 39, will be mainly responsible for the day-to-day running of
Scottish Television.
Mr Macdonald, who has been managing director for nearly six years, will
concentrate on strategy and future planning. His promotion to executive
chairman was announced earlier this month.
Mr Flanagan, who comes from Glasgow, qualified as an accountant before working
for Touche Ross, the PA Consulting Group and a subsidiary of the US cable
corporation Nynex.
He joined Scottish Television as finance director in February 1994 and played a
leading role in negotiating its strategic alliance with the cable and satellite
television company Flextech earlier this year.
Mr Flanagan said: ``My time at Scottish has allowed me to appreciate the needs
of our programme makers and I will do my best to help them maintain our
position as Scotland's top television station.''
A new finance director is still being sought

TOUGH targets for education and training for year 2000 were announced yesterday.
The figures by the Advisory Scottish Council for Education and Training Targets
(Ascett), had been revised from those originally set in March 1994.
Mr George Kynoch, the Scottish Office Industry Minister, said higher levels of
achievement were needed to build well-educated and flexible workforce.
It would be a workforce which was not merely ready to cope with the increasing
pace of change in the economy and in technology, but well-placed to seize the
opportunities this presented, he said.
Professor John Ward, chairman of Ascett, said that although Scotland led the UK
in many of the measurements, she still fell behind many competitors abroad.
There was evidence of a flattening out in attainment.
The targets announced by Ascett were:
q.By age 19, 85% of young people to attain five Standard Grades or the
equivalent. (Position now 72.5%).
q.By 21, 70% of young people to attain three Highers or the equivalent. (Now
51%).
q.60% of workforce to be qualified to level of three Highers or the equivalent.
(Now 47%).
Mr Frank Pignatelli, director of education at Strathclyde Regional Council,
said the third target posed a problem because the annual increase needed was
2.6% and recent increases at 0.8% had been ``abyssmal''. The 13% gap which had
to be closed was equivalent to 253,000 employees.

PART of Scottish Youth Theatre's Winter Festival, this one-off evening of four
rehearsed readings is the culmination of a two-year programme of local writers'
workshops and the rigorousness of this process is reflected in the quality of
the work.
Most impressive was James S. McNulty's The Sunmaid, which, while rooted in a
gritty contemporaneous world of urban alienation, is underpinned by the fairy
tale allegory of a maiden imprisoned in the tower. Beautifully scripted, with a
great ear for street-smart idiom, McNulty also shows an impressive grasp of
theatrics, with the building suspense heightened by Robin Wilson's understated
direction.
Wilson also directs Gavin Sayers' The Trouble With Mr Charlie, a short,
stylised evocation of the lingering effects of bullying. Sayers's work is
powerful and inciteful, boldy depicting the strange dependency of the tormented
on the tormentor.
Bram Gieben's Billy Joe is less subtle, with the young playwright over-egging
the pudding. A Scottish family sit down to a meal and in the course of it has
to digest adolescent anguish, suicide, murder, hints of incest and fatal
disease. However, like McNulty, Gieben has an assured grasp of dialogue.
Douglas Maxwell eschews a contemporary setting to opt for a period piece,
although he brings a Po-Mo sensibility to The Chamelion's Play, the tale of a
group of actors planning the assassination of Oscar Wilde. Again, the script is
highly literate and dramatically sophisticated, but is too self-conscious, with
an overuse of Wildean epigrams, to really succeed.
An invigorating evening, excellently performed by the second year students from
the RSAMD, who clearly warm to material they can directly relate to.

As the Broadcasting Bill is published television companies are hit by takeover
speculation
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has secured guarantees that a Scottish
production base will be protected no matter who owns Scotland's television
companies.
The assurance came as the Government published its Broadcasting Bill, the main
provision of which allows greater cross-ownership between newspaper groups,
television companies and radio stations at both national and regional levels.
There will be a public interest criteria by which the regulatory authorities
can assess and approve mergers or acquisitions.
In addition there will be more scope for digital technology, with provision for
the licensing of an anticipated 18 digital terrestrial channels.
Mr Forsyth has been engaged in Cabinet discussions to secure the future of jobs
in Scotland and to ensure that any takeovers do not damage Scottish interests.
It is understood that publication of the Bill was delayed by a week while Mr
Foryth was engaged in talks on the matter with Cabinet colleagues. Some 500 to
600 jobs in Scotland could be affected.
In a statement issued last night, Scottish Arts Minister Lord Lindsay welcomed
the inclusion of provisions in the Broadcasting Bill to safeguard regional
production on ITV in Scotland.
He was also pleased that Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley had agreed to
extend the scope of the Gaelic Television Fund to cover Gaelic radio, and that
she was prepared to consider including measures in the Bill which would improve
the scheduling of Gaelic radio.
Lord Lindsay said: ``From representations we received from Grampian TV and
others we were aware that the local input to these services might be put at
risk following any relaxation of the regulations governing television ownership.
``We are delighted that Cabinet colleagues have recognised the importance of
including provisions in the Bill which, if enacted, will ensure that,
irrespective of ownership, the quality and range of regional production on ITV
will be safeguarded.''
Mrs Bottomley said the Bill set out a proposed new regulatory framework to
allow the development of digital terrestrial broadcasting and amend existing
media ownership rules.
The proposals would give the UK a world lead in the development of digital
broadcasting technology services, and would help UK media companies compete
more effectively in overseas markets by allowing them to exploit opportunities
in the expanding global media market.
She said: ``A strong, diverse broadcasting market which reflects the national
and regional characteristics of the UK can only be achieved if our media
companies can compete effectively in the international market place. The
proposals I have set out today wil help UK companies compete effectively,
creating commercial and employment opportunities for the UK at home and
abroad.''
Labour, however, was more cautious. Shadow Heritage Secretary Jack Cunningham
said the Bill did not meet the challenges and opportunities offered by the huge
growth in multi-media services that was set to take place, describing it as a
Bill for the present, not the future.
On cross-media ownership, he said the new provisions would require very close
scrutiny. Mr Cunningham said: ``With the removal of the two-licence limit it
will be important to look closely at the ownership of regional ITV franchises
by national newspaper groups where the parent company also owns significant
numbers of local papers.
``I am concerned that it appears that the only newspaper group significantly
disadvantaged by these proposals is the Mirror Group.''

Local Government Correspondent
SCOTTISH local authority leaders have asked the Government to join them in
mounting an investigation into the role and powers of quangos.
Underlying the offer by Cosla is local government's desire to win back powers
from the bodies whose members are appointed by the Scottish Secretary rather
than directly elected.
Cosla vice president Councillor Keith Geddes reminded a full meeting of the
convention in Edinburgh yesterday that there were now more than 5000 members of
these appointed bodies compared to just more than one thousand councillors in
the new unitary local authorities.
In addition quangos controlled more than #5.5bn of public spending.
Council leaders have suggested that the current joint Scottish Office/Cosla
Task Force, which had been examining the rules governing the behaviour of
councils and elected members could be the right vehicle to examine the role of
quangos.
They made the offer at a meeting yesterday with Scottish Local Government
Minister George Kynoch at the Scottish Office.
The Minister has not yet responded to the suggestion, but Cosla will put its
proposal in writing and expect to receive a reply at a scheduled meeting with
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth in January.

THE White Settlers, (Radio 4) up for cultural discussion or, as Scottish Watch
would have it, claymore-dissection, this week are the English incomers to the
Highlands.
Taking all that Haste ye Back stuff seriously, admiring the peaceful empty
spaces, and noticing you can buy a friendly wee castle for the price of a
bedsit-sized bungalow in Sussex, many southerners have taken up residence among
the natives, and John Forsyth wanted to know the extent of ill-feeling they had
experienced, if any.
He figured a Catch-22 situation existed, whereby if the newcomers kept to
themselves, they would be accused of snootiness but if they got involved In the
Community, they'd be accused of taking over and their colonialist tendencies,
their oppressive Empire mentality, their offensive fantasies of fuedal
landlording would become manifest.
Well, take Pauline Catt for example. Were she my neighbour, my curtains would
be twitching like a midge-infested Scottie dog, my natural nosiness elevated to
Infiltration Investigator.
A doddle of an assignment this one would be, actually, for the aforesaid
Pauline is so blinded by her sense of racial superiority (letting slip that she
once lived in Nigeria as well as Kent) that she is becoming careless, almost
braggadocio in her activities.
She hardly keeps her imperialist intentions under her WRVS hat - Girl Guides,
Women's Guild, Cheshire Homes, church flower rotas and the Inverness flower
show. Need I go on?
Her husband, obviously cannier, wishes she would not go on. That Forsyth chap
failed to pick up on her revelation in the programme her spouse ``made her
promise'' not to get involved in any political arguments, but instead she waded
in, as if through the blood of my ancestors, and with chilling defiance Pauline
declared that since Scottish people didn't have to justify being in England,
why should the English have to feel defensive when they come to live here?
Forsyth pointed out, I don't think in front of Pauline, that fleeing Jacobites
probably ran through her back garden on their way back from Culloden moor some
time ago. I think the arrogant woman would have asked the ghosts in for a nice
cup of Scottish Brew, after deviously hiding the Earl Grey, and showed them a
framed wedding photo of her daughter.
Emma Wood is writing a book about the situation, and in her incomer-interviews
she worries that no-one mentions the historical reasons for the quietness; the
ethnic cleansing of the Clearances, and the murderous policies of the past.
English herself, she admitted to a feeling of being here on sufferance -
``though there's no reason to creep round in sackcloth and ashes''.
NOT an option considered for a second by Terry Butcher, former captain of the
English football team, who has lived in Bridge of Allan for nine years, runs a
hotel and has no problems enjoying playing at Chieftains now and then, while
admitting to his sense of English identity, which is fair enough.
The youngest of his sons is convinced he was born in Inverness (though his mum
says different) and he thinks the English are posh, and say ``I say'' a lot.
But his 12-year-old brother, Nicholas, says that the teasing can become nasty,
``more hate'', and at the rugby camp two boys from Newcastle were going to get
a right kicking before they were whisked off.
And there's the nice sounding Dr Hugh Jones, who was made to feel a southerner
when he lived in Yorkshire, who vastly prefers Scotland, appreciates his
children's good local school, mildly resented some sections of SNP
electioneering talk with made the incomers fell unsettled and undervalued, and
who works as a consultant at a hospital in Inverness.
But don't drop your guard, he's a consultant dermatologist. Don't say your
Agent didn't warn you - they are getting under our very skin.

THE relaxation of restrictions on media ownership proposed by the Government
yesterday sparked off a wave of takeover speculation in the television industry.
All three ITV stations serving Scotland saw their shares boosted by speculation
that they would soon be gobbled up by larger media groups.
Carlisle-based Border, the smallest ITV company on the UK mainland, soared 27p
to 245p.
Scottish Television, in which Mirror Group and Flextech, the US-controlled
television programme commissioning company, each have a 20% stake, gained 22p
to 491p.
Grampian Television, which is 40% controlled by two Scottish fund management
companies - Abtrust and Edinburgh Fund Managers - rose 16p to 219p.
The Government's Broadcasting Bill abolishes the present restriction on one
company owning more than two ITV licences. Instead, the Bill says that no ITV
company should control more than 15% of the total television audience.
The change was welcomed by large media groups that are keen to expand further.
But many smaller players which fear losing their independence, expressed
reservation.
Grampian gave the Bill a very lukewarm welcome. ``We would have preferred to
see the retention of the two licence ownership rule, but are encouraged by the
success of the Scottish Office in having some regulatory protection for ITV
regional commitments included,'' said chief executive Donald Waters.
However, Scottish Television, which has often been mentioned as a potential
bidder for Grampian, welcomed the easing of ownership restrictions.
Managing director Gus Macdonald said it would ``allow terrestrial broadcasters
to keep pace with competition in the current rapid expansion of multi-media
activities''.
His view may well be coloured by the enthusiasm of Scottish Television's two
main shareholders for the relaxation of television ownership rules.
Mirror Group spokesman Nick Fullagar said: ``We are delighted that the
Secretary of State has seen our point of view that Channel 3 (ITV) must be
allowed to consolidate.''
``We have always aspired to have a significant holding in a bigger group of ITV
companies and this now makes it possible,'' he added.
Flextech chief executive Roger Luard meanwhile reiterated his company's
ambition to expand its interests in ITV. Flextech sees ITV broadcasters as
important sources of programming for its associated cable and satellite
channels.
The main hope of the smaller ITV stations is that the big boys will ignore them
as they struggle to buy up the larger English licences.
By the time those battles are over the heavyweights may be too close to their
15% audience quota to take on any more.
Two main ITV groups are widely seen as emerging to dominate the market.
Carlton-Central is tipped to merge with MAI, which owns Anglia and Meridian.
That would create a southern-based group with 14.8% of the UK television
audience.
Granada, which owns London Weekend, is meanwhile seen as a predator for
Yorkshire/Tyne Tees. That would create a group with a 13.1% share of the market
focused on the north of England.
Both blocks would be too big to take on Scottish, which has a 3.6% share of the
national television audience, once its 20% stakes in HTV and GMTV are counted
in.
``What you could end up with is two big blocks, one in the north and one in the
south, and the Celtic fringes,'' one Scottish Television official said.
Mr Peter Brownlow, finance director of Border Television, took a similar view.
``Border Television, because of its size, may be an easy target, but if another
ITV company wishes to buy a significant player it will look elsewhere,'' he
said.
Although the Broadcasting Bill will make it easier to develop cross-media
links, it will not not necessarily encourage Scottish newspaper and radio
groups to rush into television.
Scottish Radio Holdings - the owner of Radio Clyde, Radio Forth, Radio Tay, and
Northsound, said it had no plans to invest in television.
Caledonian Publishing, owner of The Herald and Evening Times, said the
Government's proposed relaxation of media ownership rules would not entice it
into broadcasting.
``We have no short-term ambitions to go into either radio or television,'' said
chief executive Liam Kane. ``The focus for our expansion is newspapers or
indeed magazines. I think we will stick to what we are good at.''

SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi, one of the world's top advertising companies, is withdrawing
from the Tory Party advertising account, it was announced yesterday.
The decision follows the party's request to renegotiate its exclusivity
agreement.
The planned change would have resulted in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising working
alongside other agencies in future Tory campaigns.
Conservative Party Chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney said: ``We have been very happy
with the quality of work. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising have chosen not to be
part of this larger grouping we want to put together but we understand the
reasons for their decision.''
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising's chairwoman Jennifer Laing said: ``This is a
professional decision that we should part company; as an agency we do not work
in a co-operative with other agencies.
``The coming campaign needs to be very single minded. We part on good terms and
with finances settled.''
The agency hit trouble early this year when Maurice Saatchi, who formed Saatchi
and Saatchi in 1970, was sacked in a boardroom coup. He went on to set up rival
firm M and C Saatchi with his brother Charles in January.
Yesterday's move could open the way for a return to the political frontline by
Maurice Saatchi, who is still a senior adviser to the Prime Minister and a
close confidant of Baroness Thatcher.

RAYMOND Leppard's guided tours of the main cities in Mozart's life have
provided the SCO in recent seasons with some cleverly compiled and beautifully
executed concerts, each of them stitched together with genial spoken
commentaries by the conductor himself. This week the subject has been Mozart in
Salzburg, scene of the wunderkind's first triumphs and launching pad for what
would become his great cycle of concertos and symphonies.
Thursday's programme in Edinburgh, repeated in Glasgow last night, displayed
Mozart's Salzburg style in four contrasted works, two of them diverting, one of
them flamboyant, and one - the sinfonia concertante, K364 - a masterpiece. With
James Clark as violinist, and Catherine Marwood as his viola-playing shadow,
this disguised concerto was performed with the right sort of tension, in which
light gleamed through darkness, and even the orchestra's introductory
flourishes sounded uneasy.
The effect was profoundly disturbing; music filled with questions,
undercurrents, and anxieties, in which the moments of virtuosity - such as the
hair-raising skyward leaps for the soloists near the end of the finale - merely
added to the sense of unrest. In such a context, even the brilliance of the
34th symphony at the end of the programme sounded less than usually
affirmative, more than usually ready to plunge into ambiguity.
Real brightness was reserved for the little string divertimento, K136, that
opened the concert, where Leppard drew charm from every phrase and every
rhythm. The bassoon concerto, K191, likewise gained from the conductor's
insight and from the delectably grainy tone brought to the solo part by Ursula
Leveaux.

GEOLOGISTS claimed yesterday that they had pinpointed the probable site of the
biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and worked out why Lot's wilful wife
ended up as a pillar of salt.
It wasn't, as men over the generations have claimed, because she disobeyed
orders and dared to look back but due to the briny nature of the Dead Sea.
``This is an attempt to use modern geological perspectives to look into a very
racy story - the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah - and solve a fascinating
historical problem,'' said Mr Peter Styles, of the Quarterly Journal of
Engineering Geology.
The findings by two British geologists working in Canada were printed in the
journal yesterday.
While the rough location of the infamous cities has long been suspected, the
authors said they used the latest geological thinking to trace the cities to a
specific peninsula in the Dead Sea and work out the reason they vanished around
1900 BC.
Saturated soil and highly flammable bitumen, rather than God's wrath, was
apparently behind their demise.
``The area is made up of rock types which, when subjected to a large
earthquake, will actually liquefy - like shaking up a bottle of sauce,'' said
Mr Styles. ``Theirs is a great story but if, as they suggest, the whole city
was destroyed and collapsed into the sea, I don't know how much would be left
to dig up.''
According to the Old Testament, the cities were destroyed by fire and brimstone
in retribution for their sinfulness.
God warned Lot of the impending peril. However, his wife disobeyed the sole
condition of not looking back and was transformed into a pillar of salt.
Research shows it was more likely a case of mistaken identity, however.
Geologist Graham Harris said that the Dead Sea was full of salt floes that
might have been thrown up by surging water to resemble a female outline.
Mr Harris and fellow Briton Anthony Beardow analysed local soil and rock to
conclude that Sodom and Gomorrah were probably located on a peninsula that juts
out into the Dead Sea.
The sea, in fact a salt lake, is divided into two basins. The Lisan Peninsula,
where the team believes Sodom was located, separates the basins at the sea's
narrowest point.
Their analysis suggests it was a vibrant trading hub, used as a crossing point
to ship salt to the Mediterranean and Egypt.
Locals were also involved in risky bitumen mining, according to the Journal,
meaning fire would have been a constant hazard in what was an earthquake zone.
That would help explain the biblical references to the fiery destruction of the
two cities.
Mr Harris said it was impossible to tell if an earthquake set off the so-called
liquefaction process he believes swallowed up the cities but said
archaeologists and engineers should join forces to put the 4000-year mystery to
rest.
``Not withstanding the geological argument, the enigma will never ever be
resolved until artefacts can be rediscovered that can be positively identified
to those cities,'' he said. ``And I'm absolutely sure there's something left
down there.''

Douglas Hodge endured a traumatic sojourn in the Philippines to shoot his
newproject. He tells Phil Penfold about the trials of making Saigon Baby
HE reckons that he's a ``fairly tough cookie'', but actor Douglas Hodge admits
that making Saigon Baby for the BBC was ``one of the most harrowing assignments
I've ever done''.
Douglas, who has appeared in such TV classics as Capital City, Middlemarch, A
Fatal Inversion and in Bliss for the BBC, stars opposite Kerry Fox and John
Hurt in a searing indictment of the ``trade'' in young children in the Far East.
``I saw some sights that I would prefer to forget,'' he recalls with a grimace.
``We went to the Philippines to shoot, chiefly because the Vietnamese
authorities do allow filmmakers in, but they have the final say on what they
are allowed to film . . . if they don't like something in the script, out it
goes. So we went to Manila instead. And believe me, that place is the
playground for hell. Any sexual kink or perversion you want you can have.
``It's there, right on the street. You don't have to go looking for it, it's
offered to you. Children are told to go out and earn money by their families,
and they go and sell themselves.
``We also shot in some absolutely appalling slums - such as the back end of
Calcutta. In a lot of ways you feel very privileged to see the raw side of
life, but in a strange way, because no-one else ever goes there and it's not
exactly on the tourist trail. So we got a view that no-one else does. It's not
a place I would want to go back to or an experience that I would care to repeat.
``And the other sad thing is that while you're wandering around in the Far East
you realise how `same' the world is getting. The people wear the same clothes
as we do in Britain, the shops are the same, and that fast food chain is
everywhere. Whatever happened to the desire to be that little bit different
from the rest?''
But the plight of the children touches his heart. ``Especially when I thought
of our daughter, Mollie, who is now three. She has a charmed life in relation
to some of those children. When Tessa and I see pictures of the children in,
say Romanian orphanages, Mollie becomes all the more precious. But I guess that
all parents feel like that, don't they?''
Married to Only Fools and Horses star Tessa Peake Jones, Douglas says that,
``yes, we'd like to have more children. Being a parent has changed us both. You
see the world in an entirely new way, a different perspective, when you become
a mum or a dad.
``In a way, I can almost feel sorry for the couple in Saigon Baby, because they
want a child so much. They've tried for years, and nothing has happened. So the
last resort is - buy one. Money doesn't matter to them. They've got pots of it.
``But my character Michael Cooper isn't that sympathetic - he's a rich git
businessman, a real high-flier. What he discovers is that there's a huge trade
in babies, and that not all of them are perfect. There are ones with Aids and
others who are disabled. They have to get the papers together that allows them
to take the child out of the country.''
And yes, he says, he is a ``complete'' New Man. ``Whatever that is.
``I read somewhere the other day that women are getting more and more masculine
and going to football and rugby matches, while men are buying far more beauty
products. Where's the world going?''
Is he envious of the Michael Coopers of this life? ``Oh, God, no. Nothing is
any problem to them. People like that have a terrific life, and a baby is just
another thing they want. Another possession to play with. There's the argument
that anything would be better than the life the child might leave behind, but
it's a terribly complex moral problem. People who have it easy all the way, all
the time, never appreciate how nice it is when something wonderful happens.''
He has been filming in another ``glamorous, not'' location, Tooting Beck,making
a new Screen One film called It Could be You.
``Which is all about a Lottery winner who sweeps the jackpot with a win of #25
million.
``He's called Bob Whistler, and he's an electrician who lives with his wife
(Frances Barber) and child in a very ordinary house, living a very ordinary
life. Thing is, when he wins, he's got two problems. His mistress used his
money to buy his ticket, and he then loses the ticket that proves he's the one
who should get the money.
``It's a bit like a Feydeau farce, a bit like an Ealing Comedy. It's very light
and frothy, with an edge to it, great fun to do.''
Unless, of course, you've got a scene: ``running through East Street market,
where the genuine traders were getting a bit pissed off at our presence, and
then started asking for a bit more `convenience' money to keep them sweet. They
very soon got wise to the idea of a film crew making a movie!
``After Saigon Baby, I wanted to make something that was a bit off-the-wall.''
He feels the Lottery so far ``has really been only bad news, hasn't it. It
seems to corrupt people in seconds, doesn't it? And the worst thing for me was
that it seems to let the Government completely off the hook. They're now able
to crow about the `giving to charity' bit, without contributing anything
themselves. As far as I can see, it's just another invisible tax''.
He adds: ``But alright, I'll come clean with you. Although I'd never bought a
ticket before, all of us on the set subscribed to a weekly syndicate, using a
set of numbers . . . and we didn't win so much as a damn penny!''
Making It Could Be You was a blessing for Douglas and Tessa, ``because she was
working at night with the RSC in the play The Park at the Barbican, and I was
working through the day here in Tooting. So we could be with Mollie at
alternate times, which is great".
Hodge says: ``Tessa's play had incredible reviews, but there's hardly any
publicity budget! It was the complete opposite to Only Fools for her, and live
theatre which she really loves. It was great for home life because she could
get back every other night, since the play was in repertory. But that's not so
good for an actor, because you do the play once or twice a week, and go back to
it in another week, when it's like starting to learn it all over again!
``Tessa's always being asked if they'll be doing any more Only Fools and
Horses, and she keeps on saying that she really doesn't have a clue. My own
guess is that all the good storylines have dried up. But John Sullivan is such
a terrific writer and an inventive genius, so anything could happen.''
When It Could Be You finished, Douglas returned to the BBC to edit a film he
shot for the BBC's Education Unit, ``about conservation which is going to be
called The People are the Forests. I'd done all the major work on it -
directing 200 National Youth Theatre folk and three professional actors was
tremendously exciting - and had to go back and lick it into shape in the
editing process''.
He adds: ``There are a couple of future projects that may or may not come off.
The sort of thing that if I mention them now and they don't happen, I shall
look a total prat!''
Did he ever consider leaving the UK to work in the States? ``Tessa and I
thought of maybe going off to work in New York at one point. There were a few
interesting things offered that never seemed to quite get off the ground. And
then Mollie came along, which put paid to all that. I just love being a
father.''
Douglas and Tessa now live in Buckinghamshire. ``Which means that for It Could
Be You, I had to be up and out of the house by five in the morning to get to
the set!
``But the childhood in the Medway towns was useful in catching the South London
accent again - it's all too easy to drop into it. I rather like Bob Whistler,
for all his faults. He and his wife Wendy are, at the heart of it, honest and
they have no illusions. I think that they're as tough as old boots - she
certainly is. He's recognisable, a bloke that you can identify with.
``In fact, if we've got it right, then I reckon that there'll be a lot of men
sitting in pubs across the country, thinking `this is all terribly familiar'
and even `there but for the grace of God . . . '.''
In a lot of
ways you feel
very privileged
to see the raw
side of life

MICHAEL FORSYTH'S great vision for the future of Scotland is causing
consternation among officials who actually have to operate the thing. In the
coming year he has tabled meetings of the Scottish Grand Committee in Stirling,
Inverness, Aberdeen, and all over the place.
The trouble is that this involves flying up to Scotland and providing hotel
accommodation for substantial numbers of people. The list is as follows: Four
Hansard reporters, a Deputy Sergeant at Arms, two Commons Badge Messengers and
a committee clerk.
In addition are the added expenses for MPs who normally would travel straight
from their various locations in Scotland to London, but will now have to divert
to Stirling, Inverness, Aberdeen, etc...
Then there are all the costs of paperwork, the labour costs of setting up the
meeting halls, and the telephone bills. One exhausted Hansard reporter told the
Diary  that she was not exactly relishing the prospect of belting up to
Scotland once a month and then belting back to Westminster to report a normal
day's business.
Forsyth, however, seems determined, and at least this week had the good grace
to pay tribute to the hours worked by his own staff. He acknowledged that they
sometimes are at their desks early in the morning and leave late at night.
One Forsyth aide, asked if  he thought his boss was a slave-driver, looked
about for a few seconds and then said: ``Well, it's challenging.''
Nil points
MR Martin Redmond, Labour MP for Don Valley, is rapidly moving up the ranks of
MPs who ask questions which, at great expense, produce answers in which no-one
has the slightest interest.
He recently asked the Secretary of State for Scotland if he would list, for
each of his executive agencies for the last financial year, in respect of
overseas travel by staff, the cost, the countries visited and the posts held by
the staff involved.
In came the replies, which showed that some organisations, such as the Scottish
Agricultural Science Agency, had sent people abroad, but the Scottish Office
Pensions Agency, the Student Awards Agency for Scotland and the Scottish Courts
Agency all said ``nil.'' As we have reported before, it costs between #250 and
#350 a time for this fascinating information.
MacKays and Mackays
HOW many MacKays/Mackays do you think are now operating in the House of Lords?
The answer is six. The new Lord Advocate, Lord (Donald) Mackay of Drumadoon,
sworn in the other day, added to the list which, of course, includes the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and front bencher Lord MacKay of
Ardbrecknish.
However Tory peer Lord Reay is Hugh William Mackay, and his fellow Tory Lord
Inchcape is Kenneth James William Mackay. In addition, the independent peer
Lord Tanlaw is Simon Brooke Mackay.
Apparently, when the new Lord Mackay was introduced  there were some
mutterings. ``Another bloody Scot, and worse still another one called Mackay,''
came a comment from one front bencher.``Do you have to be a Mackay to get to
the House of Lords?'' Oh well, at least there is only one Baroness Gardner of
Parkes.
Back to school
STICKING with the Lords, we are indebted to the Earl of Mar and Kellie, who has
a novel view of how the proposed new nursery voucher scheme might work in
Scotland.
He told peers the other day: ``My nephew Euan currently attends a playgroup in
his home village of Kilmelford on two mornings a week and on two other mornings
a week my sister-in-law drives him to Oban to attend another playgroup.
``The distance between Kilmelford and Oban is a far from straight 20 miles. The
two return trips are a barely sustainable 80 miles. How will Euan administer
his nursery school voucher in those circumstances? Will he be able to use the
playgroup's safety scissors to cut it in half?'' Over to you, Euan.
Coat of office
WHO was that wearing Scottish Office Minister Raymond Robertson's coat as MPs
disembarked at Heathrow the other day? It was Monklands East Labour MP Helen
Liddell, who had picked up the wrong garment. We are told that some unkind soul
from the body of the aircraft bellowed: ``Helen, I didn't realise you were so
desperate to get into Government.''

SNOW in Madrid? The Euro in your pocket? There seemed something not quite real
about the EU summit yesterday, especially one which is being billed as the most
important for years.
Outside the meeting thousands of bored policemen, looking more like terrorists
in their balaclavas and machine guns, stamped to keep warm as the snow turned
the city white.
John Major's jibe that the single currency could be akin to Alice in Wonderland
was slightly off the mark - the Euro was actually born in a winter wonderland.
The decision to baptise the Euro before it was born was taken with a remarkable
lack of enthusiasm, almost as though those responsible for this momentous
decision were embarrassed or perhaps in awe of their own responsibility.
They were, for once, doing something which will actually have a real, daily
impact on the life of every single European citizen - even those whose
governments can't or won't join the single currency from the start.
The deed was done quickly. In less than two hours the EU's finest political
brains and most powerful political leaders, in all their collective wisdom,
concluded that they could not come up with anything more imaginative than the
Euro. (They could have got that idea from this very newspaper which suggested
months ago it would be the boring Euro - remember you read it here first.)
There was none of the usual bragging afterwards by the various national
delegations who normally claim negotiating triumphs for themselves on such
occasions. Instead, the name was formally adopted with fearful lack of fuss.
To mark the occasion, there were - refreshingly - no champagne toasts and no
long-winded speeches of self-congratulation which normally mark such EU
occasions. The Euro's midwives merely went off for a long lunch with the King
of Spain who picked up the tab.
President Chirac of France had taken the huff when it became clear the name Ecu
was to be ditched. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany then kicked him when he
was down by ruling out a public opinion survey so that the people could give
their views.
A British spokesman, annoyed at suggestions that John Major was grumbling about
the Euro but unable to come up with a more acceptable name of his own,
responded tartly that ``there were no weirdos - you know, like doubloons or
ducats...''
Jacques Santer, the European Commission president, voiced desperate support for
the doomed Ecu, but his views were also drowned as the Euro was swept to life
on the crest of a wave of ennui.

THE soon-to-retire chief constable of Strathclyde, Leslie Sharp, yesterday
spoke of the worst day of his life when he learned that a young constable had
been stabbed to death.
He also reflected on his 4!s-year spell in charge of the UK's second biggest
police force, likening it to being captain of the Queen Mary.
Mr Sharp, 60 next May, made his comments shortly after he received a very high
commendation award at a Strathclyde Police long-service and good-conduct medal
ceremony in Glasgow.
The chief constable, who steps down on Hogmanay, said it meant a great deal to
him that ``ordinary bobbies'' had gone to such lengths to mark their
appreciation.
Asked to reflect on the highest and lowest point of his spell in Strathclyde,
he said the worst day of his life had been June 17 last year, when Constable
Lewis Fulton was stabbed to death in Glasgow.
Mr Sharp, who was in London at the time lecturing on the success of Operation
Blade, said the incident put him at his ``lowest ebb ever''.
Mr Fulton, 28, died after going to the aid of colleagues during a street
disturbance in Gorbals.
Mr Sharp said his appointment as chief constable was the high point of his time
in charge. ``It was quite unique for an Englishman to come up here and take the
top police job in Scotland,'' he said.
``Being the chief constable of a force like Strathclyde is like being captain
of the Queen Mary. It is a big organisation. It takes a little while to change
course. But once you change course it goes full steam ahead and gets there in
the end.''
He said he had no advice for his successor, Mr John Orr, who takes over on
January 1, other than to say the force was ``in good heart''.
Seven police officers who challenged three men after an armed robbery at the
Bank of Scotland in Brandon Parade, Motherwell, last September, were among 20
officers commended for bravery yesterday.
Sergeant Kenneth McIvor, 40, from Airdrie, received a very high commendation
after pursuing and apprehending one of the men, who had a handgun. He was also
promoted to inspector.

FIVE people died last night in a five-vehicle road crash.
Three other people were very seriously injured, according to a Cornwall force
spokesman.
Four cars and what was thought to be a goods vehicle were involved in the
accident just after 6.30pm.
It was thought to have happened on a B-road off the A39 between St Columb and
Castle-an-Dinas, a hill fort.
Police, fire, and ambulance crews were at the scene, near Newquay, and the road
was expected to be closed all night.
None of the victims was named by police.
Westcountry Ambulance Services Trust press officer Darren Gibson said: ``This
is one of the worst road accidents we have had in the region for some time.''
Ten ambulance paramedics were on the scene from Newquay, Wadebridge, Penzance,
and Bodmin.
A police helicopter located one of the dead in a field near the accident scene,
using a thermal imaging camera.
Two men, one aged 35 and another in his 30s, suffered serious head injuries.
One had a fractured skull.
They were airlifted by an RAF Sea King search and rescue helicopter, with an
ambulance medical team on board, to Derriford Hospital, Plymouth.
Mr Gibson said two more male casualities suffered head injuries but they were
not life-threatening.
The lorry driver was not injured but later collapsed with shock.
Cornwall fire service sent three appliances to the scene and cut two people
from the wreckage.
The four cars involved in the crash - a Ford Orion, a Volvo, a Sierra, and a
Ford Capri - were all local vehicles, police said.
They set up a casualty bureau for next of kin to telephone on 01392 451009.
Meanwhile, two men died and two other people were injured in a Borders road
accident on the A7 Galashiels to Selkirk Road, yesterday.
Police named the dead men as Mr Charles Clamp, 25, of Crumhaugh Road, and Mr
Christopher Muir, 24, of High Street, both Hawick.
The two people injured were taken to Borders General Hospital. Mr Paul Currie,
21, of Beattie Court, Hawick, received pelvic injuries and was ``stable''. Ms
Jennifer Bird, of Falside, Camptown, Jedburgh, had arm and leg injuries and was
``serious, but stable''.
The accident, near Glenmayne House, happened when the Austin Maestro the four
were travelling in left the road and plunged down an embankment before bursting
into flames.
Ms Bird, who was in the rear passenger seat, was thrown from the vehicle. Mr
Currie, who was sitting next to her, was rescued by a passer-by and police
officers.

THE #375m battle for Amec now seems likely to be extremely close by the time it
ends at 1pm on Monday with many surprised at the weakness of the share price
yesterday, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Against the 100p on offer and the level it has been trading at until Thursday
it fell 2!sp to 96p which seemed to indicate that the bid may fail.
Intriguingly, Norwegian shipbuilder and engineer Kvaerner has failed to reach
the 30% level which is the maximum number of shares it is allowed to buy in the
market.
By the close, its holding was only 26.1% and so everything now depends upon the
level of acceptances.
Kvaerner chief executive Erik Tonseth has threatened to sell the holding if he
does not win. He said that in deciding whether to accept or reject the offer,
shareholders should not assume Kvaerner will be either a supportive or a
long-term minority holder of Amec.
Failure could mean a substantial loss both in cash terms and of face.
Amec chairman Sir Alan Cockshaw accused it of high-pressure bullying tactics
and that it was trying to divert attention away from the real arguments on
value.
The crucial factor is whether shareholders are prepared to take the Amec vision
of the future on trust after the many disappointments of the recent past and
the huge damage to their capital values or take the cash on the table.

THE demand for quality pork is growing so rapidly that one leading pig-breeding
company is seeking to attract Scottish arable farmers into setting up
large-scale outdoor herds, writes DAN BUGLASS.
The rewards, according to Eric Oakes, who is the managing director of
Somerset-based Peninsular Pigs, can be very worthwhile with a return on capital
of ``20%-plus''.
Outdoor pig production in Scotland has expanded rapidly over the last ten years
and perhaps 25% of the national sow herd is now run on this
environmentally-friendly system.
The appeal for more farmers to start up herds is principally fuelled by Marks &amp;
Spencer which wishes to source all its pork from pigs born in the open air.
Mr Oakes commented: ``The pigs are produced to a relatively wide specification
on a contract price significantly above the average all pigs price (AAPP) for a
specific market. It's not a speculative business. We know how many pigs are
required each week and it's rather like being a member of an exclusive club.''

A BABY born prematurely was recovering in Leeds General Infirmary yesterday,
after her mother was flown 8000 miles for an emergency Caesarean operation.
Chloe Anderson was born after the RAF made a 20-hour flight from the Falkland
Islands with her mother, Carol.
Mrs Anderson, who lives on the islands off the east coast of South America,
with husband Eddie, was suffering from dangerously high blood pressure and
would have died without treatment.
Her daughter, who was two months premature, would also have died without the
emergency mission, as the island hospital is not equipped to deal with the
problem.
Mrs Anderson's condition was diagnosed by Leeds infirmary-based consultant
obstetrician and gynaecologist Paul Vinall, who visits the islands each year to
give voluntary medical help.
He immediately called in the RAF, whose Aeromed team delivered the patient to
the hospital in four stages - involving a jet, helicopters, and an ambulance -
giving her intensive care all the way.
The baby weighed just 1lb 11ozs when she was born hours after her mother
arrived at the hospital. She is now three weeks old and is slowly gaining
weight.
Mr Vinall said Chloe, who is expected to remain at the hospital for several
months, is doing superbly well and is over most of the hurdles. He said she now
has a 95% chance of normal survival.

IT WAS ironic really. Dr Kennedy, the heart specialist, used to play for
Stirling    County. I'd had a pain in my chest and so I was referred to him. It
was all going so swimmingly until he looked at the ECG trace and decided to
whisk me into hospital to have a wee look inside. So, as you eat your bran
flakes beneath your Herald, you lucky people, I am lying somewhere, hopefully
getting better. Whatever, it's time for me to relax, reflect, and get the
stress down at the tender age of 38. I've had this flaming virus you've all
had, so hopefully that's all it is.
I think rugby is careering mentally out of control with professionalism. It's
gone potty, and    the smile has gone out of the game. We have journalists
using players to slag off other journalists. Hey, I've done it myself, but it's
completely out of order. We have players saying things about other players, and
then saying they never said that. I don't think I've seen quite so many people
lie in such a short period of time.
We have an unhealthy fixation with money. And we have people on the periphery
looking for a way to make a buck out of it. In fact, we have a fixation now
about everything that surrounds rugby, rather than with the playing of the game
itself.
Rugby is a wonderful game. If you haven't played it then you can't know the
sheer unadulterated joy of wandering from lineout to lineout, on an autumn day,
with the smell of deep heat in the air and the sun poking between the trees,
just having fun.
A friend of mine reminded me recently that rugby is a players' game. Most of
the good folk in the world who play are doing it for fun. If you haven't played
the game you'll never know the thirst afterwards, the sore way your body felt
on a Sunday morning, and the deep sensation of being one of a pack of 15
people, sometimes more, who all have the same love of a silly game. The
memories of people who have played rugby are filled with the daft episodes, the
times of elation, the funny        stories, and the sad times.
I doubt if any player in the world thinks to himself at the end of his career:
``Yes, I remember getting a grand for that game.'' Not a bit of it. They
remember the tries, the way they won, and what they changed about the way they
went about playing their beloved game called rugby. They remember the moves
they dreamed up, the      tactics, the feeling sometimes of being backs to the
wall and loved by nobody when it got up a level. They remember the tears, and
the laughs. Most of all, they remember the laughs. Bloody hell, I do any way.
But here we are, absorbed by players' contracts and whether there is a win
bonus or not. And clubs squeal like stuck pigs to try to get a slice of the
action in Europe. They actually fool no-one, and a thing called self-interest
is very much to the fore.
But, there I go, getting side-tracked.
I've learned a lot this week. I've realised that I shouldn't have played
against Romania all those years ago, instead I should have stayed in bed with
the raging fever and given the body a chance.
I shouldn't have trained with all of those colds, and I         shouldn't have
played with them either. My last game of big-time rugby was at Twickenham with
antibiotics for tonsillitis and nursing a cold. Lunatic. I swam with this virus
a week ago. Idiot. I smoked for years. Chump.
I've also learned that, no     matter what, rugby may be only a game but it's a
good game. It's big time and it's fun.
Whatever, I am taking no more early-morning calls from Bill Hogg.
After all, rugby's recent changes seem to have been very bad for my
cardio-vascular system.

LIVESTOCK farmers must continue to concentrate on efficient production but not
production on the cheap, said Don Curry, chairman of the Meat and Livestock
Commission yesterday.
They must also do everything they can to ensure consumers trust the production
process and feel good about the meat and meat products they buy.
In an end-of-year message delivered at the annual Cirencester farming
conference Mr Curry presented a very positive picture of an industry that has
been hammered by negative images in recent months.
The market demand for meat had remained remarkably stable at around 65kg per
head per year for the past 15 years, although the pattern had changed with
poultry and pig meat taking market share from beef and lamb, largely as a
result of product development and price.
``This may come as something of a surprise given much of the media coverage in
recent years that has tried to suggest otherwise. The perception sometimes
fostered by critics of the meat industry that there is a rising tide of
vegetarianism is clearly not supported by the facts.''
Despite various restrictions, British beef exports had grown strongly with 93
different countries taking almost 300,000 tonnes in the past year. Lamb and pig
meat exports were also buoyant and the home catering market increasingly
featured British meat.
``We clearly have a livestock and meat industry that is not in decline as some
might suggest. Quite the reverse. Ours is a dynamic industry prepared to
diversify to meet changing demands and claiming a greater share of our home
market and aggressively exploring all export opportunities.''
However, he admitted that ensuring consumers felt confident about meat and meat
products in relation to alternatives would be a major challenge in maintaining
and expanding demand in the future.
For farmers this meant efficient production. This did not necessarily mean
producing on the cheap; it meant producing the right quality of animal as
efficiently as possible using the technology now available to help deliver the
right product for the market.
``Up to now British livestock farmers have been very successful at improving
quality and reducing production costs. But not enough of us know precisely what
our production costs are, particularly in the ruminant sector.
In order to remain competitive against other meats, other foods, and other meat
producing nations, we need to become even more professional. It also meant a
greater emphasis on education ``so that ignorance is neither a barrier to
building trust nor something that can be exploited by unscrupulous critics''.

ALAN McDowall has ruled himself out of tomorrow's important fight at Glasgow's
Moat House, and a likely British title challenge, after a hand injury in
training last night.
The Renfrew light welterweight was gearing up to meet Darlington's double ABA
champion Alan Hall when the mishap occurred.
The 28-year-old carelessly damaged his right knuckles after a playful smack at
a punchball in the Sydney Street gym.
But his manager, Alex Morrison, angrily said: ``He knew the stakes were high
for this one. What he did was completely stupid. Now he has blown it.''
Promoter Katherine Morrison has retained the services of Hall, who will now
meet Walsall warrior Peter Till.
Unbeaten featherweight Brian Carr, from Moodiesburn, bids to extend that run
against Abdul Mannon, from Bangladesh, and the Scot, a former ABA champion and
Olympian, should be too strong.
Edinburgh light-heavyweight John Wilson should also win when he takes on Barry
Beasam, of Plymouth, while Hamilton featherweight Scott Dixon, most impressive
on his debut two months ago, is fancied to beat another Devonian Martin Evans.
The card is completed by Glasgow super-middle John McAlpine against Burnley's
John Duckworth. q.FOLLOWING his 89-second appearance in August's fiasco against
Peter McNeeley, Mike Tyson continues his comeback tonight against Buster Mathis
in Philadelphia. If, as expected, Tyson sprints to victory, he will face WBC
champion Frank Bruno in March.

VIRGIN tycoon Richard Branson said yesterday he would sue the American company
he has accused of making him an offer he had to refuse.
Earlier this week, Mr Branson claimed on BBC1's Panorama that lottery giant
GTECH, a major backer of Camelot, had tried to bribe him to pull out of the
race for the lottery operator's licence.
GTECH denied the allegation and said it was considering legal action.
Now Mr Branson has fired the first shot by claiming that GTECH has libelled him
by calling him a liar.
``They (GTECH) have accused me of being a liar and of having spread an `evil
smear','' said Mr Branson.
``Given the nature of the accusations that they have levelled against me and
their attack upon my integrity, and given the importance of the issues that
have been raised, I have no other option than to issue a writ for defamation
against GTECH.''
GTECH said later it had received a writ from Mr Branson and would be defending
it ``vigorously''.
Mr Branson said the controversy would now get the public airing it merited in a
court.
He added: ``The Panorama programme . . . raised a number of serious issues
concerning GTECH and claims that have been made relating to the operation of
their business.
``As GTECH are major shareholders in the company running the National Lottery,
those issues need to be addressed by GTECH in a serious and considered
fashion.''
Mr Branson told Panorama that he reported the alleged bribery attempt to
lottery watchdog Peter Davis.
Mr Davis, who says he has no recollection of being told and is also consulting
legal advisers, has launched an inquiry into the affair which will centre on
allegations that Mr Guy Snowden, an executive with GTECH, tried to bribe Mr
Branson out of the lottery race.
The waters were further muddied this week when Mr Davis said he had accepted
free flights in GTECH private jets - before awarding the lucrative lottery
scratchcard licence.
Mr Branson's idea for a non-profit making lottery had popular public support
but Mr Davis, who awarded the licence, said he thought Camelot would raise more
cash for good causes nominated by the Government.

Talisman sets
sights on Goal
CANADIAN oil explorer and producer Talisman Energy has been confirmed as the
bidder for Goal Petroleum, the Aberdeen-based oil minnow.
Talisman is making an agreed #131m offer at 97!sp cash per share, a premium of
43% over the market price before the bid talks were disclosed.
The deal has already been sewn up as institutional holders of 45.5% of the
shares, mainly Norwich Union and Mercury Asset Management, have given
irrevocable undertakings to accept.
Forte hits back
FORTE has taken the fight against Granada into the enemy's camp with an attack
on its trading performance and strategy in its latest document urging
shareholders to reject the #3300m bid.
Accusing Granada of not understanding Forte's business, Sir Rocco Forte says
his antagonist ``is driven by the need to make an acquisition to reverse its
flagging rate of growth. The slump in Granada's share price since the launch of
the bid shows that there are increasing doubts about the wisdom of its hostile
offer.''
Granada immediately slammed the latest defence document as ``pathetic''. It
contained ``nothing about profits, cash generation or dividend.''
Double money
STOCKBROKER Greig Middleton's profits more than doubled from #877,000 to #1.98m
in the six months to October, the results of its parent company, King &amp;
Shaxson, reveal. Group profits rose from #1.25m to #2.06m excluding
discontinued activities.
Havelock buys

A pressure group yesterday won a crucial victory in the Court of Appeal in
London which will help protect the level of future train services. But they
were unable to push Government rail privatisation plans completely off track
due to a legal technicality. Duncan Black examines the ruling's implications
North of the Border
SCOTTISH campaigners against rail privatisation last night hailed the Court of
Appeal's judgment as a breakthrough in their long battle.
The court's decision was welcomed as ``the best possible early Christmas
present'' for passengers by the Save Our Railways pressure group in Scotland.
Secretary Richard Leonard said: ``This is a devastating blow to the
Government's plan to axe and sell off rail services.''
Not only did it mean that existing Anglo-Scottish services to King's Cross
would be protected, he said, it also set a precedent for other services. Cuts
proposed by the franchise director in the ScotRail Passenger Service
Requirement (PSR) would have to be reversed, giving an added safeguard for the
Fort William sleeper service and lifting the axe which had been hanging over
some Glasgow-Edinburgh services.
Mr Leonard said: ``Our understanding is that all the PSRs so far issued -
including ScotRail and InterCity East Coast - will now have to be rewritten.
That means all existing franchises will be delayed. The nearer the sale gets to
the General Election, the less likely it is that the Government will be
prepared to press on with this deeply unpopular privatisation.''
The judgment had two other important consequences, he added. It would force the
Government to find new cash for investment to maintain existing services, and
it would shake City confidence in the sale of Railtrack, planned for 1996.
Labour transport spokesman Brian Wilson said: ``The whole thing is discredited
and should be abandoned.''
The court decision was a very substantial victory for the Save Our Railways
campaign and it was vital that Ministers now respect the spirit as well as the
letter of the judgment, he said.
``It would be ludicrous for the Government to press ahead with two or three
franchises which are marginally within the law while the remainder go back in
the melting pot. In particular, the court quite specifically ruled the PSR on
the LTS (London Tilbury and Southend) franchise to be unlawful. Surely the
Ministers are not so desperate that they will proceed in the face of that
rebuke from the court?''
Mr Wilson said: ``The InterCity East Coast line was on the next batch and there
were places on that line which were going to lose up to 50% of their services.
But all of that is now set back.''
The court ruling had implications for all of the proposed rail franchises,
added Mr Wilson. ``Rail privatisation is further discredited, and if the
Government has any sense it will throw in the towel. The franchise director
should be sacked for acting outside the law.''
The Scottish National Party said the judgment was a great victory for users of
the rail network across the country. Transport spokesman Keith Brown said:
``The Government's sell-off of Britain's railways has been declared illegal
before it has even begun.''
Mr Brown said the Government had repeatedly given hollow reassurances that
privatisation would not lead to cuts in timetabled services, yet the appeal
court had ruled that most of the initial sell-offs were illegal precisely
because of timetabling changes.
``It is an absolutely damning indictment on Westminster and the Conservative
Party that the country should have to use the courts to protect its
infrastructure from the actions of the Government.''
For the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Charles Kennedy said he was ``delighted''
with the court's decision. ``This ruling has dealt a body blow to the
Government's privatisation plans and represents a critical breakthrough for the
objectors to privatisation.
``Given the chaos now surrounding the Government's plans, rail privatisation
should be consigned to the dustbin pending a General Election.''
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the management-employee buy-out bidders for the
InterCity East Coast line said last night that they had no comment to make on
the judgment.
But he said: ``We are committed to run a timetable well in excess of the PSR as
it stands, and where possible it will exceed the current service. We cannot
speculate upon a court judgment involving other parties, but we can say that we
are still committed to bidding for the InterCity East Coast franchise.''

Montego Bay, Jamaica
FRED Couples, who has turned post-regular season events into a lucrative
cottage industry in recent years, took significant strides yesterday in the
second round of the Johnnie Walker World Championship at the Tryall Club,
Jamaica, towards regaining the title he won four years ago by making birdies at
four of the last five holes.
That surge gave Couples a score of 67 and a total of 137, five under par, to
share a three-stroke lead with Fiji's Vijay Singh and Wayne Riley, the
Australian holder of the Scottish Open title, both of whom bogeyed at the last
hole after they had driven to the rough.
On another afternoon of hot sunshine and high humidity Couples, despite his
ailing back stiffening up, made seven birdies for the day's lowest score. He
made six of them with single putts on greens many of the 20-strong field found
difficulty in reading, and one with a holed chip shot. Two other putts saved
par.
Singh, who has won twice on the US Tour this sason, had three birdies and the
eagle 3 he made at the seventeenth, 524-yards long but downwind within range of
a short iron which he struck to within 20 feet, looked as if it might give him
the outright lead until he made his final mistake.
Riley, who led by three strokes from Singh overnight had lost it all by the
turn, but he counter-attacked with three birdies in six holes from the twelfth
and it was only when he compounded his driving error at the last by hitting his
second shot into a bunker that he, too, dropped back into a tie.
Loren Roberts, who lost to Sam Torrance in September's Ryder Cup singles, also
came to grief at the eighteenth but still held a two-stroke advantage over the
third American player in the first five, Mark Calcavecchia, whom many still
cannot bring themselves to believe won the 1989 Open Championship at Royal
Troon.
Certainly, the prospects of any of the four Europeans following Nick Faldo, who
won the event in 1992 receded almost into invisibility. Bernhard Langer was the
closest pursuer, but a distance of seven strokes away, and Colin Montgomerie,
Faldo and Torrance, respectively five, seven and 10 over par, are now playing
only for money.
Two-round scores and aggregates:
137 - F Couples (USA) 70, 67; V Singh (Fiji) 69, 68; W Riley (Australia) 66, 71.
140 - L Roberts (USA) 70, 70.

148 - L Janzen (USA) 75, 73; B Mayfair (USA) 75, 73; A Cejka (Germany) 73, 75.

q.DAVID Feherty , a Ryder Cup player only four years ago and joint fourth in
last year's Open, has said he is quitting the game.
The Ulsterman, in Jamaica this week as a television commentator, switched to
the American tour two years ago, but this season finished 166th on their money
list and lost his card.
He has split from his South African wife Caroline and says he does not plan to
return to Europe at the moment because his two children are in the States.

<HEADLINE>`Fatal dose' of alcohol consumed by crash motorist</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974864513</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MOTORIST who crashed on the A9 should have been dead . . . not from any
injury but from the amount of alcohol in her system.
Housewife Wilma Taylor, 45, was almost six times the legal limit, which
medically speaking is a fatal dose, a court heard yesterday.
Fiscal David Hingston told Dingwall Sheriff Court: ``She was in danger of dying
from the amount of alcohol she had consumed.''
When motorists rushed to the crash scene near Evanton, in Easter Ross, they
found Taylor sitting in her car, polishing off a quarter-bottle of whisky.
Mr Hingston described how Taylor, of Wester Balblair, Beauly, first hit a kerb
and stopped. A passing driver, a Mr MacKenzie, went to her aid, only to find
her drinking out of the bottle.
The fiscal said: ``He had no legal right to remove her car keys but very public
spiritedly offered to drive her home. She refused. But he remained nearby to
keep an eye on her.''
She drove off. Despite an oncoming driver's attempt to avoid her, she collided
with him on the grass verge.
At this stage, Mr MacKenzie stepped in and took away Taylor's car keys.
Meanwhile, Taylor finished off her bottle of whisky while awaiting the arrival
of the police, and threw away the empty.
She also had to hang on to a policeman to stand up and, instead of blowing into
the breathalyser, she dismantled it.
Taylor admitted driving dangerously while unfit, refusing a breath test at the
scene, and giving only one of the two required breath samples at Alness police
station.
Sheriff James Fraser deferred sentence until January 8 for reports.

ALLAN Donald tormented England in Durban with the bat then ruined their day
altogether in his more accustomed role as an innings-wrecker.
South Africa's brilliant fast bowler contributed 32 unlikely runs to a highly
damaging last wicket stand of 72 with new-ball partner Shaun Pollock.
But, having taken 103 minutes to steal the initiative away from England as a
No.11, Donald needed only two deliveries to complete a dramatic third Test
turnaround.
The first, at the end of his opening over, was snicked by Mike Atherton into
Andrew Hudson's hands no more than an inch or two from the ground at gulley.
The second, during Donald's third over, saw new No.3 Graham Thorpe edge another
low chance, this time to Daryll Cullinan at first slip.
From being up against the ropes only an hour into the second day's play, South
Africa were suddenly landing one telling blow after another. By the time bad
light brought a premature close, the home side were ahead on points with
England struggling at 123 for five, still 102 runs behind.
That, however, was only part of the problem for Atherton's men as an injury
jinx returned to haunt them again.
John Crawley, racing round the boundary in a vain attempt to stop the 4 that
registered the home team's 200, was no more than a couple of yards from the
ball when he pulled up in agony, clutching his left hamstring. The injury looks
like ending his tour and he must now bat with a runner.
Injuries were almost an everyday event in Australia last winter. So were
batting collapses and, in Durban, the two went hand in hand again.
Atherton, perhaps, had to fail because no-one can be a hero all the time. But
seeing the man who thwarted them in Johannesburg walking away with only two
runs to his name was just the boost South Africa needed.
Thorpe was forced to fill the No.3 spot after Crawley's injury - and became the
twentieth England player over the last 111 Tests to find it a jinxed position.
The spot has now produced just 10 centuries in 199 innings.
From 13 for two, Alec Stewart and Robin Smith steered England into slightly
calmer waters while adding 70 runs. But then up popped support seamer Craig
Matthews to give South Africa another lift just when they needed it.
Durban-born Smith, having struck six boundaries, pushed at one of several
deliveries that bounced more than expected and another low chance was snapped
up by Brian McMillan at first slip.
Stewart, meanwhile, looked on course to end a sequence of 13 Test innings
without so much as a half-century. But when nine runs short of that
mini-milestone the vice-captain sliced a back-foot force to Hudson in the
gulley.
Matthews had struck two key blows in as many overs and not even Jack Russell
could deny him a third success before close of play. The keeper, who kept
Atherton company so loyally during that unforgettable last day in Johannesburg,
knuckled down for another 42 minutes until being caught by the leaping Jonty
Rhodes at point.
Graeme Hick and Dominic Cork managed to see out the final two offers before
gratefully accepting an offer to leave for bad light. But a day that had
started so brightly for England was by now gloomy in more ways than one.
With Peter Martin completing a four-wicket haul when McMillan edged to Russell
and Mark Ilott removing Rhodes, Dave Richardson and Matthews in the space of
six balls, the tourists had enjoyed a golden first hour.
But their inability to shift South Africa's final pair until spinner Richard
Illingworth bowled Donald through the gate 35 minutes after lunch took the
shine of all that sparkling work.

BOTH Scotland teams won their semi-finals at the European Championships
yesterday here in Grindelwald, Switzerland, to qualify for today's finals.
The Scottish women - Katie and Edith Loudon, Karen Addison, and skip Kirsty Hay
- had two impressive victories. Having disposed of champions Denmark by 8-4 in
a morning quarter-final, they went on to beat Norway for the second time this
week with a 6-4 win last night.
Scotland took a single at the first end, Norway blanked the second, then
settled for a single, and stole another single at the fourth. In the fifth, Hay
had a chance to take the lead but had to settle for just one shot.
Norway went ahead again but Scotland's breakthrough came in the seventh end
when they scored 3. Norway ran out of stones in the tenth end.
Scotland's men - Roger McIntyre, Mike Hay, Norman Brown and skip HammyMcMillan
- dominated against surprise semi-finalists Italy to win 5-1. They now are only
one game away from retaining their European title.
McMillan won this game the hard way, scoring four of his five points when he
did not have last stone, including the first end. After steals in the sixth,
seventh, and eighth ends the Italians conceded. Results:
Women. Quarter-finals - Sweden 13, Finland 2; Norway 7, Switzerland 6; Denmark
4, Scotland 8; Austria 3, Germany 10.
Semi-finals - Scotland 6, Norway 4; Germany 10, Sweden 3.

THE Princess of Wales broke with her routine by skipping her regular morning
work-out at an exclusive gym, where the alleged new man in her life turned up
for a fitness session yesterday.
Wealthy property developer Christopher Whalley braved a battery of cameramen to
train as usual at the Chelsea Harbour Club gym in West London.
He was named by two national newspapers as having struck up a secret friendship
with the princess after meeting at the fitness centre.
However, following his visit to the gym this morning, the man at the centre of
the latest royal speculation vanished.
He arrived at about 7.50am in a black J-registration Mercedes, accompanied by a
man who shielded him from the cameras as they walked in from the car park.
Later in the morning, other club members leaving the gym told waiting newsmen
Mr Whalley had already left.
At about 10am, a man drove the Mercedes to another area of the car park, took a
black holdall and black plastic bag from the car, and drove away in an orange
Golf, taking the keys to the Mercedes with him.
According to a report in yesterday's Daily Mirror, Mr Whalley, 40, began a
relationship with the princess 14 months ago, after they met at the gym.
The Cambridge-educated bachelor has met the princess for breakfasts and lunches
at Kensington Palace and in fashionable London restaurants, and is believed to
have spent weekends with her at his remote farmhouse in Yorkshire, according to
the newspaper.
He is believed to run London property development company Stemplace Ltd.
Staff at a firm of accountants at the offices in Battersea, south-west London,
where Stemplace is registered, said Mr Whalley would not be available for
comment yesterday.
Mr Whalley and the princess are reported to have met and began their friendship
after she stopped him on the stairs at the Chelsea Harbour Club and said:
``What does a girl have to do to get a coffee around here?''
Mr Whalley is said by friends to be ``the ultimate charmer''.
The Sun describes Mr Whalley as a ``dashing hunk'' and one of the most eligible
bachelors in London, and says the princess's friends have thrown a cloak of
secrecy around him.
It quotes one friend as saying: ``She never wanted this to come out. He's been
discreet and loyal and doesn't consider his friendship a big deal.''
Asked about the relationship, Mr Whalley told The Sun: ``I'm not one of her
regular friends. So she's phoned me a couple of times - what exactly is the big
deal?''
Asked if he thought it was bizarre that Diana should call him after meeting in
the gym, he told the newspaper: ``Of course not. Everyone's entitled to have
friends.''
q TODAY, the defunct newspaper, was fined #75,000 yesterday, after publishing
extracts from a book on royal bedroom secrets.
News UK Ltd, the newspaper's publisher, was fined #50,000 and its editor, Mr
Richard Stott, #25,000.
After the case, Mr Stott delivered a stinging attack on the Prince of Wales.
Through his counsel, Lord Lester, QC, he said he had offered his ``unqualified
and sincere apologies'' to the High Court in London after admitting that the
article, taken from the book by the prince's former housekeeper, Mrs Wendy
Berry, had breached a worldwide injunction.
However, outside court after the verdict, Mr Stott said the whole action had
``a great deal more to do with who was involved than what it was about''.
He added: ``It is absolutely outrageous that the Prince of Wales would want to
consign people to prison for that kind of thing, when he is prepared to go on
TV and talk about his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles and other matters
of confidentiality.''
The prince had obtained a worldwide injunction banning Mrs Berry from cashing
in on her nine years' service with the royal family at Highgrove, which ended
in 1991.

A WOMAN was led from a court yesterday after shouting at the man accused of
murdering her daughter.
Ms Dorothy Niven's mother shouted: ``I am doing a life sentence because of what
you did and my husband is dying in hospital.''
Salesman Richard Karling, 43, denies drugging and murdering Ms Niven after she
threatened to end their affair.
Mr Karling, of Bellview Crescent, Ayr, told the High Court in Glasgow he found
Ms Niven lying face down in her bed and thought she was ill.
However, advocate-depute William Totten, prosecuting, told him: ``She was a
young, attractive, and vivacious girl and you were obsessed by her.
``You gave her expensive gifts, a Rolex watch, a car, and holidays abroad, but
you had no more money and the good times were running out. If she had put you
out of her life, you would have been left sitting in your rented flat with
nothing and you could not accept that.''
Mr Totten said Mr Karling did not try to waken Ms Niven when he said he found
her in the bed, because he knew she was already dead.
Mr Totten told him: ``You killed her. You got her to her home by drugging her
with Temazepam and killed her.''
Mr Karling replied: ``No.''
He denies murder and claims Ms Niven led a double life working as a secretary
for the Students' Loan Company and as a sauna girl.

TODAY, the defunct newspaper, was fined #75,000 yesterday after publishing
extracts from a book on royal bedroom secrets.
After the case, the paper's editor, Mr Richard Stott, delivered a stinging
attack on the Prince of Wales.
Mr Stott, through his counsel, Lord Lester QC, had offered his ``unqualified
and sincere apologies'' to the High Court in London after admitting that the
article, taken from the book by the prince's former housekeeper, Mrs Wendy
Berry, had breached a worldwide injunction.
However, outside court after the verdict, Mr Stott said the whole action had
``a great deal more to do with who was involved than what it was about''.
He added: ``It is absolutely outrageous that the Prince of Wales would want to
consign people to prison for that kind of thing when he is prepared to go on TV
and talk about his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles and other matters of
confidentiality.''
The prince had obtained a worldwide injunction banning Mrs Berry from cashing
in on her nine years' service with the royal family at Highgrove, which ended
in 1991.
However, the former royal housekeeper, now believed to be living in Canada,
went ahead and published in the US. In her book, The Housekeeper's Diary, she
claimed she was revealing the Princess of Wales's bedroom secrets.
Lord Lester had told Mr Justice Potts the Today article had been taken from a
book that was already in the public domain. and that the case bore parallels
with the Spycatcher saga.
The European Court of Human Rights had found that, because Peter Wright's book
had already been published abroad, all secrecy had been lost and
confidentiality could not be maintained by an English court.
However, Lord Lester said Mr Stott did not realise that the European court's
decision did not affect contempt of court orders made in English courts.
News UK Ltd, publishers of Today, was fined #50,000 and Mr Stott #25,000.
Lord Justice Potts said Mr Stott had received advice from leading counsel
before the book was published in the US and, if he had taken the same direction
after the book came out in the US, he would no doubt have been warned ``publish
at your peril''.
He said the case stemmed from an injunction issued in the High Court in January
this year, restraining Mrs Berry from publishing or revealing anywhere in the
world information which came during her employment in the royal household.
Mr Stott and News UK had admitted they knew of the injunction when they
published in July but were unaware it affected them because the material was no
longer confidential, unpublished information and was available everywhere.
Lord Justice Potts said both parties had committed a serious contempt of court
but he accepted that the editor acted on mistaken advice from his own house
lawyers and, for this reason, he was not committing him to prison.
Mr Stott said outside court: ``At least I am not in the Tower. We were never
served with this injunction - a wide-ranging injunction which should have been
served to everybody.
``This was information I suggest was in the public domain and this is not the
sort of situation where you try to put someone into prison.
``This area of the law is a complete muddle. No-one knows where they are going
on this. It is complete and utter nonsense for Buckingham Palace to serve an
injunction which does not state clearly what we are supposed to do.''

NOT that he would admit it, but if anyone on the Goldenacre pitch today has
greater reason for nerves than the title-chasing Stirling County players it is
Heriot's winger, Elliot Bunney.
One feature of being an athletics star - and Bunney certainly was that with a
record six Scottish senior 100 metres titles, one more than Scotland's only
Olympic sprint champions, Eric Liddell and Allan Wells - is that failure lets
down only one's self. Team sport brings corporate responsibility, of which
Bunney, making his first XV national league debut, is aware.
``It's a team game, and I don't relish all this personal hype,'' insists the
28-year-old, who last season returned to the game after a 12-year absence.
Perhaps the fact that his most significant track honour was Olympic relay
silver hints that Bunney is at heart a team creature. Inevitably, however,
those with a sense of history dwell on the prospect of his following Liddell on
to the wing for Scotland.
Bunney won't entertain such talk. ``I started playing for fun, and that's still
what this is about for me,'' he says.
Though he has quit the track, Bunney still works at sprint drills twice weekly,
not least to support internationalists Jamie Henderson and Doug Walker, who are
preparing for the New Year Sprint at Meadowbank. Bunney, alloted joint back
mark beside one-time Heriot's winger Walker, does not wish to make a fool of
himself and will not race.
The conditioning, however, has kept him sharp, and his pace should not surprise
Stirling. After all, his best times put him ahead of Welsh winger Nigel Walker,
the former international hurdler generally acknowledged as the world's quickest
wing.
With Livingston last year, Bunney scored with his first touch, then seven tries
in eight games. He had one try in his only Heriot's first XV appearance, a
friendly against Preston Lodge.
Appetite for the physical          aspects has been lacking in most of those to
have made the transition from track to rugby. By all accounts, Bunney has not
been found wanting.
q.ROB Andrew has predicted a bright future for Newcastle after the threat of
relegation from Division 2 was lifted. The RFU's competition sub-committee,
handed the task of increasing the second division from 10 to 14 members,
decided there would still up a two-up, two-down passage betweens divisions one
and two but opted against a play-off between league two's bottom club and the
fifth-placed in three.
Now Andrew, Newcastle's rugby director, sees the decision as a major step
towards Newcastle becoming one of the giants of the English game.

<HEADLINE>Councils pledge a Burns festival lifeline</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE International Burns Festival has been thrown a lifeline just weeks before
it is due to get under way.
Local authorities in the South-west of Scotland have pledged a further #169,000
to save the bicentenary celebrations from collapse.
A last-ditch plea to the councils and enterprise companies - which have already
pledged #260,400 - was successful, and first priority for the organisers will
be to pay for the festival brochures, which they could not afford to send to
the printers.
However, Cunninghame District Council stood out among the nine principal
backers, when it refused to give the festival more money.
Labour MP for Cumminghame South, Mr Brian Donohoe, said: ``I am not surprised
at the decision. The festival has been so badly marketed that it causes me
nothing but despair.
``It is a total and absolute shambles and those people responsible for its
organisation must bear the consquences.
``They have lost a golden opportunity to attract tourists to Ayrshire. I don't
believe they have harried people as much as they should to back the event.''
He added: ``There were 30,000 people at Burns's funeral. They will be lucky if
they get a few thousand at next year's event.''
Among responses from other core funders of the festival, only Kyle and Carrick
District Council have yet to decide on a request for a further #45,484 grant.
It wants talks with the organisers next month before making its decision.
In Cumnock and Doon Valley, councillors agreed to a #10,000 grant, only two
thirds of the amount requested.
Mr Stuart Finlayson, acting chief executive of Kilmarnock and Loudoun District
Council, said: ``If additional financial support is not generated, then the
festival will fold.
``If the festival folds, there will be no economic or other benefits for the
area and the council will have to make a contribution towards wind-up costs.''
Mr John Struthers, festival director, said: ``Despite considerable efforts, it
has not proved possible to recruit a main sponsor.
``Our current cash-flow projections show that by the end of the festival, in
March 1997, it is likely there will be a deficit of some #235,000.
``We have considered the possibility of cutting some of the programme but even
cutting all of it would only reduce the risk of financial exposure marginally.
``Furthermore, reducing the number of key events would seriously jeopardise not
only new sponsorship but also the sponsorship already pledged.
``We believe we are on the verge of putting in place a viable and successful
festival.''
It has emerged that the only sponsorship obtained includes #25,000 from Tennent
Caledonian Breweries, #20,000 ``in kind'' from Dalblair Motors of Ayr, and an
estimated #80,000 from the Bank of Scotland and United Distillers.
Mr Struthers said they had five other firms who could be described as ``strong
leads''. They were also holding fresh talks with Strathclyde Regional Council
and the Scottish Tourist Board about finance.

SCHOOL friends and teachers paid their last respects to flu victim Stephen
Mackenzie at a special church service yesterday.
The eight-year-old from St Mary's Roman Catholic Primary School, in Paisley,
collapsed from the illness last weekend and died at the town's Royal Alexandra
Hospital.
Classmates joined a large gathering of family and friends for a funeral Mass at
the town's St Mary's Catholic Church.
Parish priest Father Tom Jamieson said Stephen was a star pupil and added:
``Boys and girls in Stephen's class said Stephen always made people laugh.''
Referring to the youngster's classmates, Father Jamieson said: ``He was always
a friend to all his brothers and sisters.
``If any child was in the playground with nobody to play with, Stephen would be
the one to go over and play with them. He was a friend to anyone.''
Parents Thomas and Jacqueline followed their son's tiny white coffin as it was
carried out of the church to Woodside Cemetery nearby.
Stephen, who had been off school with flu, collapsed and died in the family
home in Broomlands Street, Paisley, on Saturday morning.
His mother had found him lying unconscious in the hall. All efforts to revive
him failed.
Doctors said it was extremely rare for flu to be a killer.

Why does football bring out daftness in otherwise sensible people?
Gavin Kennedy ponders the folly of businessmen and football financing
BEING ``fitba daft'' is relatively harmless. It is an affliction found to
varying degrees among football supporters and among certain businessmen (and a
few business women) who run football clubs.
With few exceptions, owning a football club is just plain daft in business
terms. Hard-nosed business folk, who can smell commercial follies at Jodrel
Bank distances, can go weak in the head whenever that folly is a grass pitch
with wooden rectangles at each end.
The businessman fan has only to sniff a chance to realise their childhood
dreams and they throw their hard-earned cash at debt-ridden, hopelessly
loss-making, non-commercially run outfits, against which, no amount of sensible
advice can deter them.
If they count their spare cash in millions - Walker of Blackburn, or Hall of
Newcastle, even Murray of Rangers - their follies are their own. They can
afford to lose it all. But when they count their cash in hundreds of thousands,
or less, their follies can have consequences well beyond themselves.
Why does football bring out daftness in otherwise sensible people? Re-living
Saturday's matches on Monday morning with your mates - even mates from rival
tribes - is one thing, but putting real money into controlling a club merely to
end up with a free seat and a hot pie in the director's box is another. Sure,
that is not how they see it when they commence their folly but as surely as
linesmen punish your team with outrageous offside flags, a free seat is all
they will end up with, until, that is, the brute course of financial disaster
forces them out.
The dreadful tragedy of Hillsborough has had an enormous effect on all clubs by
its rulng that to play football at the highest level the clubs must accommodate
the spectators in modern and safe stands. Progress has been spectacular. What
commercial sense failed to impose, the deaths of fans made obligatory.
Football in the ``good old days'' was watched in wretched conditions. Yet you
can still hear fans deep into nostalgia for the camaraderie of the chanting,
singing, swearing, and occasional sweet banter of the dirty cages they stood
in. One radio commentator, bemoaning the lack of passion in a recent game,
blamed it on the ``impossibility of seriously singing sitting down''.
Why did the owners not invest years ago? Simply put, the answer must be, with a
few honourable exceptions, that they did not have to invest in their stadia
because their customers were willing to put up with unplumbed depths of filth
just to see their team playing and, if they were not willing, they could stay
away for all the controllers of clubs cared or noticed.
The economics of football are as lunatic as the Common Agriculture Policy.
Football depends on the willingness of its customers to pay to see their team
defeat another team for ``points''. The winning team takes the points and goes
home happy; the losing team gets nothing and goes home bitter. The team with
the most points from the scheduled number of games wins a league championship
and gets a shot at the bigger money available in European football. And, to
maintain the interest of the weaker teams, they have other chances to win a cup
competition.
But, as night follows day, the impossibility of satisfying everybody is
obvious. If some teams win, other teams must lose. A sense of crisis is
inevitable whenever one's own team loses. Heads are called for: the manager's,
the players', and the owners. To avoid the consequences of these inevitable
fates, the managers, the players, and the directors play a game called
``Survival at all Cost''.
Team managers demand money from the owners to buy new players, who, in turn,
demand more money to move to clubs that are desperate for their services;
owners throw what money they can at buying solutions and, when this does not
work, or if they have no money, they resort to bank borrowing. They might
persuade the bank to lend them money or, as dangerous, they might resort to
pledging the club's assets to the bank, including the stadium and land, the
players' registrations, and any ancillary assets associated with the club's
past. In doing so, the club's future earnings are pledged in a desperate effort
to climb up the league table or to win a cup. But if they succeed other clubs
must fail in a vicious circle.
The bottom teams borrow to get back up and the top teams borrow to stay up -
thus the endemic financial problems of football are fully explained. That is
why almost all clubs are in debt to some extent, with many in debt to
horrendous levels. The million or more that they borrowed to buy a player, who
was intended, nay certain, to be the club's salvation, imposes mounting
repayment costs whether they save the club or sink with it. When what has to be
paid back exceeds what can be financed out of the club's actual earnings, the
club sinks into a debt swamp, against which selling assets brings only
temporary relief.
Borrowing to punt for glory is a hit-or-miss affair. That million pound-plus
player can be crippled for life three minutes into his next game, and thereby
be a worthless asset on the balance sheet. Fortunately, that does not happen
too often, but injuries just less than career-breaking do occur regularly,
which raises issues about the relatively poor treatment in Scotland for
prematurely retired players compared to the more generous treatment they
receive in England, courtesy of the efforts of the players' union. A proportion
of the television and transfer monies should be used to fund a players'
benevolent scheme. The Scottish football authorities, however, have declined so
far to discuss this proposal seriously with the Scottish players' union and
meantime the victims of occupational injuries must rely on the benevolence of
their clubs).
Managers can have a short club life too. Declarations of confidence from
chairmen are usually a prelude to an abrupt sacking. But managers do not come
or go cheap. They can cost as much as top players, even in modestly successful
clubs, and where they cannot expect large salaries they go for long contracts,
and sometimes both, as a bargaining hedge against abrupt dismissal.
Having borrowed to the hilt, sold and bought players, and changed managers,
probably more than once, the only people left to blame are the owners. This is
less frequent in football than is common where lenders and shareholders have
greater powers. Football clubs lead charmed lives in this respect. Companies
making similar losses, with a deteriorating risk-reward ratio, would be on a
bank's ``watch list'' shortly before intervention. Of course, the banks make
good money from their indebtedness and there is no need to feel sorry for any
bank's plight.
As long as the tangible assets of the club can cover the debt, the bank may
continue to help beyond the patience it shows to other customers. But to
liquidate the club's assets and realise the money the club owes, would
automatically liquidate the ability of the football club to function. Showdown
would mean shutdown.
That this does not happen too often (eg Third Lanark) is a testimony to the
folly of football financing. There is always somebody around who will try their
luck at owning a club. That somebody can come from anywhere. In Celtic's case,
Fergus McCann crossed back over the Atlantic on the back of golfing holidays.
Some of these saviours save their clubs permanently, others do so only until
financial imprudence catches up with them. Still others make things only worse
than they were before they got notions well beyond their personal means
(consider the history of Hibs before the current owners fortunately stepped in).
Football is unlike other business sectors. In the normal market, each firm
competes for the customers of other firms and their strategies of success are
underpinned by a determination to drive the weaker firms out of business.
Success is measured by profitable performance. Those firms that succeed pay
high salaries to those in charge of their success. The weaker firms cut costs,
and therefore rewards, to their failing employees. The richer firms can
innovate or copy at their discretion.
In football, failure leads clubs to bid at ever higher prices for ``better''
players and managing staff. The imperative is to invest from a narrowing asset
base, probably already mortgaged beyond the hilt. But they must either borrow
to invest or face the ignominy of retreating to a lower division; hence pride
overcomes prudence. It takes three or more years to turn round an ailing
business in a normally competitive market, but in football, a 10-month season
is long-term. Often, the owners have only a few months to get it right again
and that is why the bank is resorted to so recklessly.
No football club has any business incentive to drive another club out of
business (I exclude the aberration of Wallace Mercer's bid for Hibernian FC).
If football clubs competed to drive their rivals out of business, against whom
would they play on a Saturday? Ever-weaker teams from impoverished lower
divisions would not fill large stadia with paying customers for too long. Even
the legendary ``never-bored-with-winning'' Rangers fans would soon tire of 20-0
victories over ``Auchindinny United''. Competition in football takes place on
the pitch between the teams and not in the form of products in a general
market. Both groups of customer consume the product - the same game - at the
same time. Each club, therefore, needs credible rivals to survive so that they
can succeed when they beat them. That is what the customer pays to watch.
Clubs arose from local communities a hundred years ago and some small number of
them regard their place in the sun as an inheritance and fiercely defend their
right to the top spots.
Team competition on the field is the foundation of the financial follies of
most clubs. The noisy exhilaration of scoring a goal and the silent despair at
losing one, drives owners, managers, players, and customers to want someone -
usually the bank - to spend money they have not got themselves to keep their
team scoring goals, or stop letting them in.
Everything is fired by the need for a winning result. Each round of competition
leads to more and more expense and, ultimately ineffective, attempts to improve
performance. The sensation of the first #1m player shrivels in wonder against
today's sensation of the first #8m player - how soon before the first #50m
player? The richer clubs raid the poorer clubs for the best players; the poorer
clubs turn out team the ``B'' teams of the richer clubs, because they can
afford to buy only what is off-loaded by them. What will happen to this fragile
financial merry go round when transfer fees are abolished, or radically amended?
This is not all. Football is a regulated business sector like few others.
Professional football is governed by the administrators of the Scottish
Football Association and the Scottish Football League. These bodies are elected
from individual clubs and area associations across the country and they set the
rules, decide the changes, impose the fines, and maintain the discipline of all
players, professional and amateur.
It is possible, thereby, that people can rise in the game's convoluted
structure to the very top and end up controlling a multimillion-pound business
sector, even though they have never played or managed at the highest (or any)
level of the game, nor ever run any sizeable business, nor sweated over meeting
a weekly payroll out of diminishing earnings with their homes in line for
repossession, nor been noted for very much (not a sin, mind you, but neither is
it a qualification). They can rule over those who have done it all and more,
and they can enforce the fiercest discipline, including incredible fines that
would embarrass an vengeful judge.
Football recently has discovered new and vast sources of income in the global
entertainment business. The World Cup and the various regional cups (of which
our own European Champions' League is but one) are firmly under the financial
control, not of the clubs, whose employees, the players, create the
entertainment the world willingly pays to see, but of the national, regional,
and world governing bodies, from the SFA, through UEFA, to the very top at
FIFA. The clubs and their employees do not get a look in. They must obey all
the decisions of the governing bodies, right down to height of their socks, and
submit unconditionally to their jurisdiction.
This rich seam of income - we are talking about hundreds of millions -
strengthens the governing bodies over the clubs and the players by an
ever-greater degree. The clubs, heads down, have not noticed or, if they have,
cannot do anything about it, the significance of the strategic shift from club
football, with its myriads of little dramas and petty personality clashes and
crises, plus financial lunacy, to football as a global entertainment business,
with its TV, sponsorship, and mass merchandising mega-bucks deals. The game's
administrators, by default perhaps, by sheer good luck of being in charge of
the beautiful game, have found themselves beyond the reach of the most
ambitious of club chairmen (any of whom they can, and occasionally have,
slapped down for daring to stick their heads above the parapet).
The consequences of the Bosman case for transfer fees (a source of income, as
well as a major expense, for cash-strapped clubs) are not fully understood just
yet but serious change is one consequence we can be sure of even now.

To be the belle of the Christmas ball, you have to be head and shoulders above
the crowd. Prepared to put up with almost anything, Anvar Khan goes in search
of the perfect party hairdo
TRIED &amp; TESTED
n The styles on this page are representative of the range of results you may
expect when you have long hair and ask a reputable Scottish stylist to dress it.
I gave no instructions, other than I was going to a party and the stylists were
not allowed to pick up their scissors. This may seem somewhat cruel, like
asking a mechanic to work without a spanner, but I deemed it a fair challenge.
Hairdressers are notorious for wanting to cut hair. So what happens when they
can't snip? How do you glamorise someone then? The point system is subjective,
and suggestions for where-to-wear-it are pure speculation.

The office was divided on this style, as I walked the lonely corridor from the
paper's fashion studio, where Charlie did her work, to my desk. ``Oh, what have
they done to you?'' said a female colleague. ``Well, at least we're honest''
said one of the cheekier wimps, after he entertained a savage chortling at my
expense. ``Oh,'' I sneered, ``what a saving grace that is.'' ``But it's braw,''
said another, ``Oh, it's gorgeous.''
Charlie Taylor is Scottish Hairdresser of the Year 1995. She's been a
hairdresser for twenty years, studied under Trevor Sorbie and got broody,
though not necessarily in that order. She has two babies, one adopted girl, who
is half-Ethiopian, the other, all of 23 months, her own. Her husband, Alastair,
is the practical side of the partnership. He's very big, a rugby player-type,
she told me (we'll get to the hair later), and he organises her. Charlie is
slim and petite and very glamorous. Hubbie may be physically stronger, but
psychologically, she's a bison. Charlie built her team and her Clarins Gold
salon from scratch, at the age of 34, she now employs 27 staff.
There was immediately the unspoken agreement that she would not put my hair up,
as she was certain that's what the others would do. Instead, she used Babyliss
professional tongs and a technique she recently learned from a session stylist
who dresses the tresses of big cats such as Marie Helvin, Jerry Hall, and
Joanna Lumley. However, I'm sure you already made that connection, when you
looked at the photo. ``It's very John the Baptist,'' offered my neighbour. For
budding musketeers, perhaps.

IT was only when we were half way through the styling process that Shona Miller
confessed she had been worried about doing a reporter's hair. She said she'd
been uptight all morning in case The Herald was doing some kind of survey in
which she failed; forgive me, I couldn't disillusion her. I couldn't tell her
there was a judging format, because I didn't want to make her more
uncomfortable. And anyway, given what she was doing with my tresses, I knew she
was going to come out tops. Regis also score high marks for being the only
salon not to ask me about my holidays.
The Regis salon is tucked away on the third floor of Debenhams department
store, and here you can be sure you're paying for the service and styling
rather than the decor. There are no leather suites to be paid off, no unctuous
bowls of fresh lilies or sunflowers, just light inches of flyaway hair
electrocuted on to white, emulsioned customer stations, and trolleys of rollers
and combs. This is a working salon, a wide space which is sometimes full, but
never full of it.
Shona washed my locks, put them in a dozen large rollers (my hair, I now
understand, has the volume of a church mouse) and sat me under the dryer. She
told me she'd been working for Regis for a year, but was still learning. She
said hairdressers swapped tips, and in that way they are a very generous
profession. Indeed, even I could see how her styling advice was being
photocopied and filed by colleagues. Shona then spent 30 minutes pinning
ringlets to my scalp after smoothing and backcombing each section. She went
straight for it, under pressure of time, and never had to undo a pin. This is
definitely a party hairdo, shapely and sleek. She's a star.

MY hair was put once again in velcro rollers, and a pleasant, cocky young chap
by the name of Ross did the honours. After asking him about conditioning
treatments for hair (I thought I might need one by now), he rattled on for
about 15 minutes about what I could do to keep it healthy. (Avoid doing hair
features for a start). I was warned off when I said I liked using shampoos with
a natural not a chemical smell.
``You don't want stuff that smells nice,'' he said, irritably, ``You want
products which are good for your hair.'' I forgave him on the grounds that he
was a man.
My hair was dried by a space age silver tadpole. The tail attached to the hood
was secured on to a hairdryer nozzle. Ross advised me on how to conduct
temperature changes in case I overheated, then flicked the hairdryer on full
blast. The tube erected with wind, and suddenly I had a hat like the body of a
puffa jacket from Cape Canaveral. Senior Stylist Carmen Little, however, was
determined to apply the personal touch.
Kissing plays a huge part in the exuberant, laddish, atmosphere of the Alan
Edwards salon. Carmen saw off a customer with a friendly peck, but couldn't
remember his name. But while there were mouths in motion, there were too few
hands. The salon was busy. Carmen needed someone to press a knot of hair, so
she could knit a chain up the back of my head, so I had to oblige. It's not
quite as bad as having to hold the needle while a nurse takes a blood sample,
but helping out any professional always makes you feel superfluous rather than
cared for. I did like this hairdo, the detail; links and pineapple tufts, were
very futuristic. Carmen also wins the prize for using the most hairgrips. I
counted out 52 when I got home.

TAYLOR Ferguson is a ubiquitous chap. He is at everyone's beck and call: the
wife, the customer, the staff, the press. His salon life would be made easier
with a pair of skates, but he is too much of a gentleman to look as if he's
thinking of himself.
My hair was sprayed with a light hairspray and set in velcro rollers. I was
then seated under a hooded drier, or ``the pod'' as I call it, for a blast of
hot air. The Fergusons insisted I had my nails and make-up done too. They
wanted me to enjoy my visit. Debbie, the beauty therapist, was very amenable.
She gave me a relaxing facial massage and coloured me in.
At one point I had three people around me, Taylor undoing rollers, Debbie
scrabbling at my cuticles, and an assistant passing the hairgrips. I actually
felt embarrassed for causing so much trouble. Anne told me she thinks Scottish
women are happy to get their hair done, but don't take to being made-up because
they see it as unnecessary pampering.
Determinant on your social life and circle, the word ``party'' conjures up
various expectations. Some dress down, so they don't ruin their best gear
during the inevitable journey to drunkeness. Others presume canapes and olives
and men with husband potential. Taylor set me up with a hairdo which would have
seen me through an interview with a UN Ambassador, shopping at Harvey Nicks, or
picking at a moonlit dinner on a fabulously expensive Mediterranean cruise
liner.
``It's very posh,'' said a friend. ``It's a bit Imelda Marcos,'' said another.
Personally, I thought I looked sensibly square, like a solicitor (the legal
kind) who's keeping her wild side under expensive wraps for the right man with
the right wallet.

make-up - for the special price of #45.

q ROUGH Quest, in front too long when a legless second to Couldnt Be Better in
the Hennessy Gold Cup, can exact sweet revenge under a tighter reign in the
Betterware Cup at Ascot today, Terry Casey's nine-year-old, ridden by Jamie
Osborne at Newbury, went to the front at the tenth and his supporters could
allow themselves a modest grin as he galloped towards the third last with a
clear advantage over his rivals.
However, the picture had changed dramatically within barely half a minute, as
Rough Quest could summon nothing when passed approaching the last, eventually
going down by 14 lengths.
Although he was anything but discredited by his performance in the Hennessy,
there is every reason to suggest that he is capable of better.
All his previous best efforts had come when produced late on, and the way he
finished the race at Newbury - hardly able to lift his legs out of the mire -
suggests that too much use was made of him.
Even Osborne, a pilot on a par with the best, admitted subsequently that the
tactics had not worked, and expect to see today's rider Mick Fitzgerald holding
Rough Quest in something resembling a half nelson during the early stages.

BOOKMAKERS William Hill failed in the High Court yesterday to stave off a
tripling of the fees they must pay for using Tote odds.
They had claimed that the fee increase from #2 to #6 at each of their 1600
betting shops was an attempt to pressurise them into taking part in a joint
venture between the Horserace Totalisator Board and arch rivals Bass Leisure
Group, who own Coral's network of 750 shops.
William Hill did not want to take part in the joint venture, Tote Direct, which
Mr Justice Macpherson said appeared to have lost money in each of its three
years of operation.
But he said he could see ``nothing arbitrary or unfair'' in the Tote's
decision, which will mean Hill's must pay another #340,000 a year.
Tote Direct enables punters to place their bets directly into the Tote pool,
but bookmakers have to pay #1500 for computer terminals at each of their shops.
The Tote announced earlier this year that bookmakers who had the terminals in
at least 80% of their shops would have their fees frozen for seven years.
The judge said William Hill had ``comprehensively lost'' their judicial review
challenge and must pay the costs of the legal action.
q STABLE lads' wages will rise by 3% from next year after their representatives
reached a ``realistic'' settlement on pay and working conditions with the
trainers. From February 1, 1996, the minimum rate for the most experienced lad
will rise to #164.83 with the most junior taking home #76.76 for a 40-hour,
five-and-a-half-day working week.
q DOPE tests on Dancing Dove, second to Chadwick's Ginger at Carlisle on
October 6, and High Five, tailed-off last behind Unchanged at Folkestone on
September 7, have proved positive.
Dancing Dove, trained by Gordon Richards, was found to have isoxsuprine in its
urine and clenbuterol, another prohibited substance was found in High Five's
urine.
Inquiries will be held by the Jockey Club's disciplinary committee in due
course.

FEVERISH speculation that Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation was poised to
bid 750p-a-share for Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday set shares in the
perceived bid prey alight.
However, what was hailed by one senior dealer as ``a good rumour for a Friday''
appeared to have lost much of its credibility by the end of the session and, in
percentage terms, Bank of Scotland made greater gains.
Shares in Royal Bank surged to an intra-day high of 658p, soaring 72p from
Thursday's close. By the session-end they had fallen back to 608p, up 22p, in
hefty volume of about 10 million shares. Bank of Scotland, which gained 12p on
Thursday, leapt 16!sp to another all-time high of 306!sp.
It was rumoured that Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) would offer
0.46 of its own shares and 300p in cash for each Royal Bank share, valuing the
Edinburgh-based bank at a weighty #6100m.
This level of detail, which has been absent in other recent instances of bid
speculation surrounding Royal Bank, lent credence to the rumour early on.
One market-maker said of Royal Bank's 658p intra-day high: ``When the stock is
going hell for leather some people make stupid prices and people deal on them.
There wouldn't have been much volume at that level.''
Royal Bank said it was not in ``any discussions with any potential bidder'' and
a hostile bid by HSBC, whose shares were off 6!sp on 998p, would certainly mark
a sea change in its philosophy.
The rumour appeared to cut little ice with the managing director of Royal
Bank's corporate and institutional banking division, Iain Robertson.
Mr Robertson took profits on 80,000 shares, more than half his entire holding,
selling them at 620p.
Royal Bank chief executive George Mathewson has said it would be extremely
unusual for a business with the bank's track record to be the subject of an
``unwanted'' bid.
Comments by HSBC chairman Sir William Purves, which indicated his regret that
Clydesdale Bank had been sold by Midland before HSBC took over the ``big four''
bank in 1992, have added fuel to rumours that HSBC is seeking a foothold north
of the Border.
An HSBC official, who would not comment on whether the group would or would not
bid for Royal Bank, said she did not think too much attention should be paid to
the ``Scottishness'' of Sir William in the context of what HSBC would like to
do.
The official emphasised that HSBC did not have a ``shopping list''.
She added: ``We are a very liquid company. We do see many opportunities of
acquiring companies, sometimes up to about 10 a week. We haven't done anything
this year. That doesn't mean we are not poised to do something next year.''
Senior HSBC executives have said repeatedly in recent months that they were in
no hurry to buy banks at current price levels.
BZW banking analyst Hugh Pye said that, on paper, HSBC and Royal Bank might be
a good fit.
But he added: ``The fact of the matter is that the Royal Bank chief executive
has stated very firmly that he is not interested, so that rather puts paid to
it.''

NASSER Hussain struck a brilliant century in Pakistan yesterday before
confirming that 1995 has seen him hit new heights as a batsman.
Hussain's England A team remain unbeaten seven weeks and nine games into their
Pakistan tour after a remarkable one-run victory against Pakistan A at Peshawar.
Yorkshire all-rounder Craig White was the other hero, conceding just three runs
from an inspired final over as England A went 1-0 up in the three match one-day
series, which ends their trip.
White also made a sprightly 39 not out to help Hussain (100 not out) put on 81
in the last 10 overs of the England innings. Yet afterwards skipper Hussain was
the first to admit that it was the Pakistanis who should have won.
He said: ``They are a better one-day side than a Test side, but we did not bowl
as well as we can. We were definitely below par today and I'm sure the lads
realised that.
``But they kept fighting and Craig White and Dean Headley bowled really well
during those last three overs. No side should lose when they have only to make
15 from the final 18 balls, and with wickets in hand.
``In the end I think it was our determination not to be beaten that probably
saw us through.''
He continued: ``We are all very aware of our unbeaten tour record. Now we have
just two more games to win to make sure we go home with that record intact.
That would be a fine achievement.''
Hussain, who has played seven Tests - the last two years ago - must now come in
back into the senior England reckoning.
England A 225-5 (N Hussain 100no), Pakistan A 224-6 (Shahid Anwar 100no).
England A beat Pakistan A by one run. Limited overs international in Peshawar.
q INDIA'S women cruised to a seven-wicket victory over England in the deciding
one-day international in Madras yesterday.
England, who went into the match with high hopes of scoring a double success
after their 1-0 Test series victory, struggled to 146 for nine from their 50
overs, with captain Karen Smithies top scoring with 38.
India were always in control in their reply, Anjun Chopra smacking an unbeaten
57 to guide her side to 149 for three with more than five overs to spare,
clinching a 3-2 series victory.

AT this time of year many people are not so much looking forward to Christmas
or even Hogmanay as to the period after that when they can get away for some
skiing.
For those venturing overseas, choosing a resort which offers good snow
conditions at a reasonable price will be top priority. But making sure you have
adequate insurance cover is also vital.
Most tour companies now make travel insurance a condition of booking. But you
do not have to take the cover in the brochure. Indeed, your travel agent will
probably try to persuade you to take out its policy instead. But compare the
cost and the cover before you decide.
A cheaper way of buying travel insurance nowadays is to choose an annual
policy. These are offered by larger building societies and banks, such as the
Royal Bank of Scotland. They normally include up to 17 days of ski insurance as
well as cover for other holidays throughout the year.
A family policy from the Royal Bank, which includes cover for up to three
children aged 18 or under, costs #130.
Naturally it is important to compare not just costs, but what the insurance
includes. If you want to be adventurous and ski off-piste, check the terms.
Some insurers exclude off-piste skiing, others will only cover you if you are
accompanied by a guide, while some do not impose any restrictions.
Snowboarding is also becoming increasingly popular. It is expected around 40%
of skiers will try it this season. But some insurance contracts exclude it as a
dangerous sport.
One annual travel policy which covers both snowboarding and off-piste skiing
(with the need for a guide) is WorldCover Direct (0800 365121). It provides 21
days ski insurance a year. The cover can be used for any number of trips (some
policies allow only one ski trip per year) so it could be used for, say, three
one-week holidays. If you are a real ski addict, you can extend your cover to
up to three months a year.
The cost of WorldCover Direct's basic annual policy is #75 for an individual,
#110 for a couple, and #120 for a family, which can include children up to the
age of 21 in full-time education. A big advantage for families is that children
are still covered if they travel separately.
WorldCover Direct's Jonathan Biles points out: ``The vast majority of travel
insurance policies insist on the family travelling together. There is no such
restriction with WorldCover Direct. Children living at home or in full-time
education are covered for all their holiday travel and school trips up to the
age of 21, even if taken without their parents, and partners can travel
independently.''
Another useful feature of the policy is that it covers travel in the UK more
than 25 miles from home. So if you intend to swan off to Aviemore for the odd
weekend, you will have the comfort of knowing you are insured for loss of ski
equipment and have such things as public liability cover.
--
IF you are going abroad, you will also need to consider your currency
requirements. An increasing number of travellers are opting to use credit
cards. Fiona Wilkinson of Visa UK says: ``As well as convenience for hiring
skis and paying for lessons, cards also tend to give better foreign exchange
rates.''
Before you go away, however, check whether your issuer provides a 24-hour
replacement service in case it is lost or stolen. Visa UK (0800 106030) is
offering a free wallet-sized ``ski pass'' which gives emergency telephone
numbers to contact if this occurs, along with useful information on the UK's
most popular holiday destinations. It also contains safety advice from the Ski
Club of Great Britain for skiers and snowboarders.
According to leading travel insurer Home and Overseas, though, most accidents
do not occur on the slopes. Spokesman Martin Mills explains: ``More injuries
happen when people are walking around a resort because they slip on an icy step
or someone ploughs into them.''
You have been warned!

NOT least among life's mysteries is Janet Street-Porter. Her very existence
begs you to wonder if the invention of television was not perhaps humanity's
biggest mistake after the walking erect game became fashionable.
If the medium is the message, Street-Porter is a distress flare, flashing
Chanel red, from an industry fresh out of ideas.
She is, in her much parodied way, the epitome of a certain kind of telly
person, what with her essentially juvenile faith in ``yoof'', her apparent
belief that history began with rap and the hand-held camera, her nerveless
smile and her verbless sentences. Street-Porter's mission, whenever she pops
up, seems to be to prove communication without content is not only possible but
desirable.
Splendid, then, to see her flounder and drown amid the banalities of Live TV in
Robert Thirkell's Nightmare at Canary Wharf (BBC2, Monday). Hired by the Mirror
Group's unlovable David Montgomery to create a 24-hour cable station that would
be bright, innovative, entertaining and, above all, cheap, Street-Porter had
her six months of pre-lauch hell captured for posterity, perhaps as a warning
to all those inclined to believe that quantity in television is next to quality.
What was most fascinating about this fly-on-the-wall was the internal politics
of Live TV. Hardly surprising, perhaps, what with participants as egregious as
S-P, Montgomery, and Kelvin MacKenzie, a man once feted in this industry for
reasons that remain mysterious. But the fabulous fun of the piece lay in the
fact this unlovely trio fell out only over entirely trivial matters. There was
no dispute over whether or not they should be producing tat; it was the nature
of the tat, its primal tattiness, that alone counted.
S-P, as acolytes know her, wanted more yoof-friendly stuff, that being the only
idea she seems to have. Kelvin fancied a spot of topless darts (the players,
not the darts) as an avant-garde challenge to the cultural hegemony and elitism
of, say, snooker. S-P swore a lot while Kelvin did a lot of smirking, as though
entirely confident that when it came to bare-knuckle boardroom bitching it
would, of course, be the man from the Sun Wot Won It. And he did.
Clive James, suddenly back on form, won nothing but amiable scorn from the folk
in Nashville when he went country (ITV, Monday) and tried to make a hit from
the sow's ear of a song he claimed to have written. It may all have been a
gentle satire on the quality of compositions emanating from Music City, but
given that this presenter's ego is equivalent to a major landmass, it was hard
to be sure. Clive has literary gifts, does he not? He has said so himself.
Either way, it was a lot of fun. We got to hear Chet Atkins play for a brief,
dazzling moment. We were given to understand that even the production and
guitar of Mark Knopfler couldn't make Clive's turkey fly. And we saw an entire
city obsessed in its every waking moment with its industry. If Hollywood is
movies, Nashville is music, another place where each year thousands of aspiring
stars go to build, or more often to bury, their white American dreams.
Jonathan Ross has a dream, we may guess, and it is a humble one: he wants to be
loved and he wants to be taken seriously. The trouble is, one wish militates
against the other. It's hard to take seriously the man who said recently that
Batman Forever is ``the best movie ever made'' but it is near-impossible to
love a personality who is, beyond question, the biggest fan Jonathan Ross will
ever have.
In Search of James Bond With Jonathan Ross (ITV, Sunday) - note the ``with'' -
was in essence yet another shameless plug for a new movie disguised as a
documentary precisely as convincingly as Sean Connery's dome was disguised by
his hair-piece. Ross interviewed various screen Bonds, pretended to drive an
Aston Martin, and invited Hugh Hefner to applaud his own lecherous appreciation
of the so-called ``Bond girls''.
It was only funny when you stopped to remind yourself that someone had paid a
great deal of money to put this slice of schoolboy wish-fulfilment on the
screen.
Someone at ITV Network Centre, or whatever the gloomy name of Channel Three's
command-and-control operation is these days, has also laid out big money on
Jack Dee, and you can't entirely blame them. He is a very funny, very talented
man, who will doubtless one day host a hit prime-time show - but not this week.
Jack Dee's Saturday Night (ITV) is one of those attempts to be all things to
all couch-potatoes. It combines a hot, young comedian new to the mums and dads
with hot, young bands, more familiar older acts, and even, as last week, a
couple of superannuated Coronation Street stars. Did someone think this would
work? Did someone imagine that the best way to promote a relatively new act was
to keep him off the stage for most of his own show? You can only wonder, come
to that, if Dee's lugubrious material will withstand the scrutiny of a mass
audience. To begin with a routine about cat's vomit might seem brave and quirky
on paper; on-stage it looked and sounded like a mess on the carpet. Even Dee
seemed to sense it wasn't working. How he will cope with a bill like tonight's,
which manages to include both Freddie Starr and Paul Weller, is a thought that
offers its own, horrible fascination.
No such surprises were offered in the two-part An Evening With Sir Peter
Ustinov (BBC, Sunday and Tuesday) and it did not matter at all. The veteran wit
has trucked his trunkful of anecdotes and memories around every major city and
most major chat shows on the globe but the brilliance of it all remains
undimmed.
Ustinov tells a story as though he were playing all the parts, including the
animals, in a big-budget epic; his jowls alone express more with a joke than
most actors manage with Hamlet. Someone, somewhere, should give him the sort of
time and space for an autobiographical documentary that is presently being
squandered on the likes of Jonathan Ross. But we should be so lucky.

I WORRY about Prince Charles. He strikes me as serious minded, well-intentioned
and hard working. Qualities which would make him an excellent King.
Unfortunately, he has a serious, possibly fatal, flaw - his navete. The
tabloids were right this week to mock the photograph on his Christmas card
which shows him perched uncomfortably on a stone garden seat with Wills and
Harry emerging from two huge urns like flowerpot men. It begs the question: is
he the little weed in the centre? Any toddler would have asked that, nevermind
a cerebral organ like The Sun.
Why then did one of the expensive chinless wonders who parade themselves as
``aides'' not point this out to him? It is bad enough that he is a
self-confessed talker to plants, an adulterer, and has friends like ``Bunter''
Soames. These alone offer countless opportunities to poke fun and not just from
anti-monarchists or cynical commentators.
Last week a former member of the Palace staff told me the Prince had called up
his lawyer and told him he is suing for divorce. ``On what grounds?'' the
lawyer asked. ``Can you believe it,'' the Prince replied. ``My wife says I'm a
lousy lover.'' ``That's why you are sueing?'' the lawyer retorted. ``Of course
not,'' said the Prince. ``I'm suing because she knows the difference.''
And, as Frank Carson would say - there's more. Apparently, days before the
wedding the young Diana had whispered to the Prince: ``Will you still love me
after we are married?'' ``Probably even more,'' he replied. ``I have a thing
about married women.''
The company I was in, which, with me as the exception, could be categorised
fairly as part of the Establishment, was howling with laughter. Each could not
wait to tell their royal joke.
But this, of course, is not unusual. Subjects have tended to mock monarchs and
their families since time immemorial. However, presenting yourself as a figure
of fun as Prince Charles is inclined to do is harmful to the very institution
he represents. It seems astonishing at a time when spin doctors abound and
every two-bit actress has a street-wise publicist, the Prince of Wales should
depend on advisers who would be better qualified writing scripts for Have I Got
News For You.
Even his wife, the Princess of Wales, with all the brain power of a spent
battery, has out-manouvered him. She is a woman who proves Ken and Barbie did
have a love child. Whatever she says is fatuous. In her Sloaney world people
don't have weaknesses and failures - only maladies. Gluttony followed by
vomiting she dignifies as an illness. For her ``love'' is not a difficult and
painful experience but a cure-all for the world's ills. She makes Tony Blair
sound sincere.
With supreme coaching from Clive James she has ambushed the Royal Family, yet
she has her title solely by virtue of being the wife of the Prince of Wales.
She may be beautiful but this does not qualify her as an ambassador abroad. It
is a truth universally acknowledged that such a woman on the loose must be in
want of a lover which is why, the nation's wives, being more calculating
creatures, distrust her more than their husbands who are easy prey to a pretty
face.
The personal life of these two individuals would not matter were it not having
an adverse affect on the standing of the British monarchy and posed a threat to
its very existence. The monarchy helps sustain in the British people a belief
in the legitimacy of constitutional, democratic government. It is difficult to
keep this in mind when the only aspect of the Royal Family discussed is who is
sleeping with whom.
Bagehot was right when he said a system of government based on rationality
alone would leave people feeling there is something missing. We need only look
across the Atlantic to see how the world's biggest democracy is desperate for
an emotional attachment to one family, hence the obsession with the Kennedys.
The monarchy not only offers a symbol of continuity and tradition; it plays a
pivotal role in our liberty. Hitler came to power in Germany by democratic
means then abolished elections. Winston Churchill and Lloyd George both
observed that had the Kaiser been there Hitler would not have got away with it.
In Italy, the King was unable to stem the rise of Fasciscm but played an
important role in re-establishing democracy. And who would argue that in Spain
the monarchy has not protected the democratic institutions from right and left
wing insurgency?
The worst excesses in the modern world have taken place in republics whether in
the communist bloc, Africa, or the Middle East. As Henry von Blumenthal of the
Monarchist League has remarked: ``Where autocratic monarchies have been
overthrown as in Iran, Iraq, Libya and Cambodia, the result has been an even
worse republican substitute.''
Bagehot warned ``we must not let daylight in upon magic'' but this is
impossible to sustain in an age when society seems hungry for scandal. What the
Royal Family needs, and Prince Charles in particular, is good PR. For instance,
the Prince's Trust is a remarkable achievement and thousands have benefited
from training and jobs under its auspices. It has aided those who found
government agencies wanting.
Add to this the tremendous job the Royal Family has done in promoting British
industry and trade abroad due to the personal touch and the close ties which
bind the commonwealth, despite differences. A realisation of this by the public
would take the monarchy out of the pages of Hello magazine and back to the
centre of our constitutional debate.
The Prince of Wales is a sensitive man but the way to the nation's heart is not
through vulgar populism or school-room humour. Leave that to the Princess.

OPPORTUNITY knocks. As big games go, they don't come much bigger than today's
spellbinder at Goldenacre. If we beat Heriot's by 43 points we retain the
championship, if we beat them by 42 points a play-off with Melrose is on the
cards, and if we lose we finish fourth in the title race.
To put 43 points between ourselves and Heriot's is a mighty tall order, but
nothing is impossible. Stirling County are certainly capable of scoring the
points required, but you would have to reckon, too, that by       the law of
averages Heriot's wouldn't finish with a blank scorecard.
Our first priority is to win. Secondly, we have to score a minimum of 43 points
and, thirdly, we have to make sure that we don't leak points at the other end.
That should make for an interesting afternoon's entertainment!
Of course, the ideal scenario from a marketing man's point of view would be for
us to finish level on points and points differential with Melrose, then the
whole thing would go to a play-off. It's happened before, away back in 1977,
when Hawick beat Gala in a winner-take-all game at the Greenyards.
It would be brilliant for the fans if it happened again, but I'll bet Melrose,
just like us, are rather hoping that it's all done and dusted today.
One guy who won't be on       parade with us today is John Manson. The prop was
sent off last weekend while playing for North and Midlands against the South. I
wasn't at the game, so I can't comment on the circumstances of the dismissal.
What I can say, though, is that John feels he has let himself and the club
down.
It's not just County. He was desperate to make his mark with Scotland this
season and, until his sentence is known, that hangs in the balance too.
I've had to sit out the inter-district championship so far because of a knee
injury, but I have gone along as a spectator to Glasgow's games against North
and Midlands and the Exiles. The fans are still voting with their feet. There
were only 500 or so at Burnbrae last Sunday for the Exiles game and I'd bet
that West of Scotland attract more for a premiership match.
There really does have to be more of a marketing effort and, certainly if
district or provincial sides are to be in the European Cup next season, then
there will have to be a    marketing blitz. If you look at how the likes of Sky
TV push football, then you see the kind of campaign that we need in rugby. Use
the players, focus on the internationalists.
TV can make Falkirk v Raith sound as appetising as Rangers v Aberdeen. You
really do need to get some hype going and that's what's going to be required
next season.
So far as participation in the European Cup is concerned, I can understand why
my own club, plus Melrose, Watsonians and Boroughmuir, for instance, want to be
involved, but for the good of the game as a whole I still think that district,
or provincial sides, should be involved from Scotland.
Three super clubs dominating the Scottish scene wouldn't be good for the
long-term future of Scottish rugby.
I do think, though, that whatever three sides we enter in Europe, we should
make use of all the top players. This would mean creating three provincial
sides from the five districts currently playing in the inter-district
championship.
I made my after-dinner speaking debut at West of Scotland last weekend. Those
who were there may well have witnessed a unique occasion. I've retired hurt
after just the single outing.

EDINBURGH-based fine chemicals manufacturer Meconic has more developments under
wraps, managing director Dr Marshall Smalley said yesterday,
writes ANDREW WILSON.
These are in addition to galanthamine which Shire Pharmaeuticals is in late
stage testing as a treament for Alzheimer's Disease and more information should
be available with Shire's flotation prospectus.
So far Meconic has used about 100 tonnes of daffodil bulbs which are the
natural source of galanthamine and is talking to growers about large long-term
contracts.
It already has a detergent to clean the lungs of new-born infants and a control
for Parkinson's Disease as well as two pain relievers.
All these are more for the future but the capital expenditure programme is
being stepped up rapidly to add about 30% capacity over the next two years. In
the first half-year as a listed company, Meconic increased operating profits by
23% to #2.5m.
The impetus came from the opiates where the Macfarlan Smith subsidiary is the
sole legal supplier in Britain - these include the active ingredient in codeine
and so as a listed drug has to be bought over the pharmacy counter and will not
be affected by any Asda-inspired price war in the supermarkets.
Speciality chemicals such as Bitrex, which is added to household chemicals as a
bittering agent, saw strong export sales as did the aloin intermediate used in
an anti-arthritis drug in France.
Full-year pre-tax profits seem set to rise from #4.7m to about #5.5m which
would leave the shares trading at around 18 times likely earnings. There is an
interim dividend of 1.65p.
Meconic is the outcome of a management buy-out from Glaxo and with the shares
at 201p, compared with the issue level of 135p in June, the original backers
have made an excellent return on their money.
New investors will benefit from the publicity from the Shire issue.
Meconic may get up to 10% of the product wholesale price and if the Alzheimer
tests are successful in what is obviously one of the leading pharmaceutical
growth markets, then there could be considerable progress in the share price.

A BABY has become the latest victim to die in an outbreak of meningitis which
in the last month has claimed four lives in the north-east of England.
The baby, who has not been named, was seven weeks old when the disease took
hold. Doctors were astonished at the speed of the child's death from the
disease, meningococcal septicaemia.
The youngster was taken to North Tyneside General Hospital's casualty
department on Thursday morning, and transferred to Newcastle General Hospital
when the disease was diagnosed, but died that afternoon.
Earlier yesterday, a five-month-old baby boy from Weymouth, Dorset, was
reported to have died at West Dorset hospital.
The number of cases of meningitis in Dorset has increased by more than 50% in
the past year.
Parents who notice any symptoms are advised to contact the nearest accident and
emergency department, if their GP is not available.
Meningitis is a bacterial infection which causes inflammation of the brain
lining.
Reece McCawll, four, of Middlesbrough, died on December 1 and, last week, the
disease killed a 16-year-old Bishop Auckland girl, and seven-month-old Mark
Casey, from Sunderland.

BAITING the banks has been a popular sport for many years, but the development
of 24-hour telephone banking opens up a brand new dimension for
misunderstanding and confusion.
At best, I like to imagine customers ringing to check their current account
balance in the middle of the night only to hear the sound of gentle snoring. At
worst, there is potential for a whole new area where things can go wrong.
Judging by the latest report from the Banking Ombudsman, there are still plenty
of problems with the banks' traditional services. So he must be quaking in his
shoes as he views the imminent expansion of finance by phone.
Telephone banking has been around for a decade or so, but now that the giant
Halifax is to join the fray it looks set for a much higher profile. Around a
million of its customers can now use the new Halifax Direct service which has
been running as a pilot scheme for the past couple of years.
The building society, which plans to become a bank in 1997, admits it is late
on to the scene, but it believes the delay means it has got the technology just
right.
Presumably though even it hasn't figured out a way of actually delivering dosh
to your doorstep or of transmitting cash and cheques back down the telephone
line to credit your account.
Both these basic everyday needs still involve customers in a trudge to their
nearest branch or cash dispenser - or a drive or bus trip if, like me, closures
have left you without an easily accessible local branch.
Once all you needed to operate a bank account was a pair of legs, a pen and a
cheque book. Now you need a car, a telephone and, maybe, a special tonepad or
personal computer as well. That's progress.
While telephone banking first came on the scene in 1986, it was another three
years before First Direct became the first bank to offer a 24-hour service. Now
there are a dozen or so banks with telephone services for customers. There are
two main types, although the addition of banking through your personal computer
is waiting in the wings.
First, there are the stand-alone services including First Direct, the Bank of
Scotland's Banking Direct and NatWest's Primeline. These tend to offer the
largest range of options and customers can usually find out their account
balance, request a statement and order a new cheque book, set up a standing
order, arrange to pay bills, transfer money between accounts, stop cheques and
arrange overdrafts.
A smaller number of options may be available from the support-type services
which back up a branch network. These include the TSB's Phonebank, Clydesdale
Telebank and services from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Abbey National.
The Halifax's Maxim current account customers have already had access to a
limited range of telephone banking services through a computerised system. With
the new service, they'll be able to talk to a real person on the other end of
the line.
``Before Halifax Direct customers could arrange to pay bills, but these had to
be set up by the branch first. Now they can simply phone our new service and
ask for particular bills to be paid,'' the society says.
Banking services at Halifax Direct should be quickly followed by general
insurance and, later, life insurance and mortgages by phone.
Meanwhile, the latest report from the Banking Ombudsman highlights the problems
that can occur when banks move into new areas, and it has some sensible advice
for fans of phone finance.
``All customers, whether using telephone or branch banking, should be cautious
. . . and ensure they are speaking to an official of the bank before giving
confidential information about their financial affairs,'' the ombudsman,
Laurence Shurman, says.
The report shows that for the first time mortgages topped the list of
complaints investigated by his office. Among other things, he believes the
problems stem from the complexity of mortgage products and packages now on
offer.
One home owner was awarded more than #8700 by the ombudsman after he complained
about a remortgage on his home in Perthshire.
He had been told by the bank that the new repayments would be just over #650 a
month when, in fact, they turned out to be more than #775.
The ombudsman also turned the spotlight on mortgage indemnity guarantees (MIGs)
- policies that are paid for by home buyers, but designed to protect lenders
when a home is repossessed and sold for less than the amount needed to clear
the outstanding mortgage.
Mr Shurman says borrowers have been kept in the dark about the true nature and
cost of these policies and calls on banks to refund some of the premium if a
borrower pays off a home loan after only a short while.
Complaints about another modern trend in banking, cash machines, dropped back
into second place on the list last year.
``It is worrying, though, that there should still be as much fraud as there is
(and perpetrated with such apparent ease), when the cost of reimbursement will
inevitably be passed back to the general body of customers,'' Mr Shurman says.

<HEADLINE>Fancier who drank his wife's divorce payment will have to sell loft or face going to jail Judges home in on pigeons</HEADLINE>

A PIGEON fancier who drank away an #8000 pay-off, which should have gone to his
wife as part of a divorce settlement, will have to sell his birds to help
settle the debt.
The sale of the pigeons and their loft is part of a bargain Thomas Robertson
hopes will keep him out of jail.
An interim interdict was pronounced against Robertson, of Cleveland Drive,
Inverkeithing, Fife, when he was divorced in 1992.
The court order in favour of his wife, now Mrs Sandra Fairley, banned Robertson
from getting rid of any money which he might receive as a result of his work at
Rosyth Dockyard.
The divorce settlement included a #7980 payment to Mrs Fairley.
Robertson received a payment of #8206 from the Ministry of Defence but when his
former wife took him to Dunfermline Sheriff Court he admitted he had spent it.
It was explained on his behalf that he had simply drunk the cash away over a
year in full knowledge that there was a court order against him.
Sheriff Ronald Alexander took the view that this amounted to a particularly
serious and flagrant contempt and jailed Robertson for 60 days. He was released
immediately pending an appeal to three judges at the Court of Session.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, who
heard the appeal with Lords Prosser and Mayfield, said the court had been
presented with a letter from Mrs Fairley saying she still had received no
payment of the divorce settlement.
Lord Ross added: ``It was also stated on her behalf that Mr Robertson, who is a
pigeon fancier, has recently purchased a pigeon loft and has several pigeons.''
There was also a letter from Robertson's solicitors offering to pay #150 a
month towards the divorce settlement.
Lord Ross said Mrs Fairley had made it clear she was interested in receiving
the money and that if it was paid she had no wish for her former husband to be
sent to prison.
The judge added: ``Mr Robertson informed us that he deeply regretted what he
had done. He stressed that he was prepared to make this monthly payment.
``He also stated that he would be prepared to sell the pigeon loft and his
pigeons, which could raise several hundred pounds, and that he would do so as
soon as possible.
``He explained that he had exhausted the gratuity which he had received from
the Ministry of Defence over a period of approximately one year.''
Robertson also informed the court that if he could get another job he would be
able to increase the amount payable to his former wife.
If he had to serve the 60 days, he would be less likely to find other work.
Lord Ross said that anyone who knowingly breached a court interdict would
normally be dealt with severely and in a case like this, a 60-day sentence
would not normally be regarded as excessive.
However, Robertson had adopted a very reasonable attitude and the main concern
had to be to ensure that Mrs Fairley received the payment to which she was
entitled.
The court had decided that the appropriate course was to continue the appeal
for six months so that Robertson could show that he was prepared to comply with
the order to pay the #7980 to his ex-wife.
The judge added: ``We have done so upon the understanding that Mr Robertson
will make payment of sums of at least #150 of month towards satisfaction of the
capital sum awarded to her in the decree of divorce.
``We also expect him to make further payments to Mrs Fairley in respect of the
proceeds of the sale of the pigeon loft and the pigeons.''
When the case came back to court in June next year the court would expect to be
told what payments Robertson had made to his former wife.
The court would decide what to do in the light of what happened over the next
six months.

THE partial victory by the Save Our Railway campaign yesterday marks the latest
in a series of moves by protesters to take their battle to the courts.
Earlier this year, Highland Regional Council secured an interdict at the Court
of Session in Edinburgh which prevented British Rail from withdrawing the Fort
William-London sleeper service until full public consultation had taken place.
That decision effectively saved the ``Deerstalker Express'' service. Franchise
Director Roger Salmon subsequently included a modified version of the service
in ScotRail's seven-year Passenger Service Requirement for the network.
Yesterday's success came after the Save Our Railways campaign appealed against
a High Court ruling last week which had cleared the franchise director of
accusations that he had unlawfully set minimum passenger service levels at too
low a figure.

MIKE Ramsay was the first player to claim a place in the quarter-final stage
when he defeated local club player Richard Campbell in yesterday's first round
of the Scotish championships at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.
Ramsay won a close first game 10-8 against the former Scottish junior
internationalist, but then cruised home 9-1, 9-2.
Cumbernauld's Peter O'Hara also went through to the last eight following a 3-1
win against Scottish junior champion Colin Hamilton.
O'Hara, a member of the Scottish senior squad, took the first two games 9-1,
9-6, before Hamilton staged a comeback to take the third 9-6.
However, it was the more experienced player who always held the upper hand in a
close fourth game, and he went through 9-1, 9-6, 6-9, 9-7 and now looks likely
to face former internationalist Graeme Sword.
Martin Heath, the No.1 seed, faced a worrying start to his bid for a first
title. The Oban player, with his brother and fellow competitor David as a
passenger, arrived over an hour late for his match after his car broke down.
However, the organisers showed leniency in rescheduling both ties for late in
the evening.
The women's joint top seeds, Claire Waddell and Senga Macfie, received
first-round byes and so begin their campaigns in today's quarter-finals.
Results:
First round. Men - P O'Hara (Cumbernauld) beat C Hamilton (SSRC) 9-1, 9-6, 6-9,
9-7; M Ramsay (Edinburgh Sports Club) beat R Campbell (Heriot-Watt) 10-8, 9-1.

ROCK star Rod Stewart's wedding anniversary celebrations were marred last night
as his family was showered in broken glass.
The singer and his wife Rachel Hunter reaffirmed their vows in a church service
at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and were being taken to a hotel in a horse-drawn
carriage when a bodyguard accidentally put his arm through a window.
Shards narrowly missed the children, Liam, one, and three-year-old Renee. The
girl had to be lifted out in tears.
One onlooker said: ``There must have been at least seven photographers chasing
them across the bridge. In his haste to stop one of them getting a picture of
the couple as they turned into the hotel, one of the minders smashed a window
on the carriage.''
Among the 30 guests at All Saints Church, Marlow, were family and friends,
including actress Susan George.
Four bouncers had earlier jogged alongside the horses as they ferried the
wedding party across a bridge from the car park at the Compleat Angler Hotel.
As Stewart, 50, and his wife emerged from the church, a piper played Flower of
Scotland.
The glass accident happened as they returned to the hotel for a reception.
Church rector, the Rev Nicholas Maloney, carried out the service on the
couple's fifth wedding anniversary.
He said it had been a service of prayer and dedication, adding that ``they
wanted to renew their vows on their wedding anniversary with their family and
friends''.

Montego Bay, Jamaica
ON another afternoon of hot sunshine and high humidity, Wayne Riley, the
Australian holder of the Scottish Open title, clung tenaciously to the lead
yesterday in the second round of the Johnnie Walker World Championship at the
Tryall Club in Jamaica. But he was strenuously pursued by Vijay Singh and the
two American Ryder Cup players, Loren Roberts and Fred Couples.
Riley had lost his three-stroke overnight advantage on Singh by the turn,
having had two bogeys to Singh's two birdies, the second of which gave the tall
Fijian the lead for the first time. But when Singh bogeyed the tenth and Riley
made his first birdie of the day at the twelfth he had resumed his leadership.
Roberts, beaten by Sam Torrance in the singles at Oak Hill in September after
having won his first three matches, moved into third place on two under par,
one behind Singh. Couples, the winner of the first championship four years ago,
was a stroke behind his compatriot with five to play.
Meanwhile, Colin Montgomerie and Torrance, the Scots who finished first and
second on the 1995 European order of merit, continued to starve themselves of
birdies. Montgomerie, who had two in the first round, had the same again and
Torrance's drought also reached parched-earth proportions as he made only two
gains in 36 holes.
Torrance again compromised his fortunes with a depressing start, a double-bogey
6 at the second, and after Montgomerie had hit a fine shot at the short third
to five feet for a 2, his inspiration dried up just as completely as his
compatriot's. About most of the field there was strong evidence of post-season
ennui syndrome.
Leading early scores:
147 - P Senior (Australia) 77, 70; C Montgomerie (Britain) 75, 72.
148 - L Janzen (USA) 75, 73; B Mayfair (USA) 75, 73.
149 - P Azinger (USA) 75, 74.
151 - T Izawa (Japan) 80, 71.
152 - E Els (S Africa) 79, 73; S Torrance (Britain) 77, 75.
160 - J Daly (USA) 80, 80.
161 - A Forsbrand (Sweden) 83, 78.
q.DAVID Feherty has said he is quitting the game. The Ulsterman, in Jamaica
this week as a television commentator, switched to the American tour two years
ago, but this season finished 166th on their money list and lost his card.
He has split from his South African wife Caroline and says he does not plan to
return to Europe at the moment because his two children are in the States.
q.RELATIVE unknowns Anthony Gilligan and Shane Robinson, of Australia, shared
the second-round lead in the Coolum Classic in Queenland yesterday after the
big names crashed out.
Ian Baker-Finch, Peter O'Malley, Lucas Parsons, and Terry Price all missed the
cut of 148, while Craig Parry survived by one shot. Leading scores (Australian
unless stated):
138 - S Robinson 69, 69; A Gilligan 67, 71.
139 - S Leaney 72, 67.
140 - J Evans 71, 69; S Alker (New Zealand) 70, 70; B Jackson (England) 70, 70.
q.SCOTLAND'S Simon Yates shot a second-round 73, one over par, for a halfway
aggregate of 149 to lie 11 adrift of Indian leader Jeev Milkha Singh in the
$200,000 Philippine Classic.

MARTIN Heath, the No.1 seed, missed his starting time due to car failure but
then celebrated the organisers' leniency with victory against Gavin Grant in
last night's first round of the Scottish championships in Edinburgh.
Heath cruised through to the quarter-final stage 9-2, 9-1, 9-2, and was joined
by his brother David, who defeated Iain Paltiel in straight games.
Chris Small, a Scottish under-19 cap, produced the only first-round upset
against John Meadley. Small failed to register a point in either the first or
third games, but went throguh 0-9, 9-6, 0-9, 9-8. 9-3.
Graeme Sword, aiming to make a return after a four-year absence from the
Scottish team, also went through 3-0, but struggled in the middle game against
another younster, Alan Tasker.
Sword, who has helped Aberdeen to an unbeaten record in this season's Scottish
League, gave the selectors an impressive indication of his form in a 9-2, 10-9,
9-1 win.
With the seeded women having received byes through to today's quarter-finals,
the only match to last more than straight games was Heather Mason's 3-1 win
over Lisa Keeting. Results:
Men. First round - P O'Hara (Cumbernauld) beat C Hamilton (SSRC) 9-1, 9-6, 6-9,
9-7; M Ramsay (Edinburgh Sports Club) beat R Campbell (Heriot-Watt) 10-8, 9-1.

STAGECOACH declared it had no plans to cut rail services on any network
post-privatisation, as it emerged that the South West Trains franchise which
the Perth-based bus company should now be awarded next week was one of only two
deemed by the Court of Appeal to be legal.
As a result of a challenge by pressure group Save Our Railways, the Court of
Appeal ruled that five of the seven franchises it considered were unlawful in
terms of minimum passenger service requirements.
The other franchise adjudged to be legal was Great Western Trains, which
franchising director Roger Salmon is expected to award to a consortium
comprising FirstBus, formed by the merger of Aberdeen-based GRT and
Weston-super-Mare-based Badgerline, investment capital group 3i, and the
existing management of the Welsh and West of England network.
Although the London, Tilbury and Southend franchise was considered illegal, the
challenge probably came too late to prevent the Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising (Opraf) also signing this contract next week.
Opraf said last night it was aiming to let the first franchises next week. Had
it not been for the appeal court action by Save Our Railways, Stagecoach would
probably have been awarded the South West Trains franchise this week.
Stagecoach last week attributed a newspaper report claiming it had won South
West Trains to the ``failed'' management buy-out team, apparently indicating
the Stagecoach bid had been successful.
However, the Perth-based company is prevented from making any specific comment
on South West Trains as a result of confidentiality undertakings.
Executive chairman Brian Souter said yesterday: ``It was in the public domain
that we were one of two preferred bidders for South West Trains.
``If South West Trains has been cleared, obviously we would be happy about
that.''
Declaring Stagecoach's strategy, Mr Souter said: ``Our bids are quality bids,
they are comprehensive bids and we have no plans to cut rail services in any of
the bids (for networks) that we are looking at.''
Referring to busy networks with little subsidy, Mr Souter added: ``Some of
these big commercial franchises have got very low PSRs (passenger service
requirements) but nobody in their right mind would cut the service. It would be
commercial suicide to cut some of these services.''
Mr Souter said Stagecoach was ``piggy in the middle'' in the argument between
the Government and Save Our Railways but the company is undeterred by the
pressure group's victory in the courts.
He added: ``Our appetite is there for rail franchises. We are interested in
them all and will bid for them all as it happens.
``If there is a delay with a court, we will stick with the process. It is an
inconvenience but has no impact on our view of railways.''
FirstBus, which has a 24.5% stake in the the consortium which is the sole
preferred bidder for Great Western Trains, yesterday declined comment on the
Court of Appeal judgment.
South West Trains, which operates the regional and commuter network out of
London's Waterloo, is the biggest of the 25 franchises being privatised.

THE task in hand for Stirling County today at Goldenacre is to put 43 points
between themselves and Heriot's, which would mean a successful defence of their
championship crown, with Melrose consigned to second place.
But for County captain Kevin McKenzie there is a target beyond today's
crucially important SRU Tennents Premiership encounter - the resumption of his
quest to make the Scotland hooker's berth his own.
For McKenzie, who has lived in the shadow of Herioter Kenny Milne - the game
does have a habit of throwing up these interesting ironies - the chase for the
Scotland No.2 shirt had taken on something like the pursuit of a holy grail.
Milne retired after the World Cup with 39 caps in the bag. McKenzie was the
heir apparent but then he got injured and missed Scotland's first outing of the
season, against Western Samoa.
The knee-ligament damage has taken nine weeks to heal and, aside from a bounce
game at stand-off last weekend, today marks McKenzie's first real outing since
a stamp on the knee put his plans on hold.
The occasion also will mark Milne's retirement from the game after 14 years in
the Heriot's first XV.
Yesterday, McKenzie, who has four caps but none against the major nations, was
wanting to concentrate on the game, but needed no reminding that today
represented the first day of the rest of his rugby life.
``Being up against Kenny doesn't enter into the equation for me. We've played
each other often enough in the past, so we both know what to expect. He has
done everything that there is to do in rugby and so he's got nothing to prove.
``For me, though, there are certainly things beyond this game. I have to play
well and make sure that the knee holds out. I don't think there's any doubt
that if I had been fit then I would have been in the Scotland side which played
Western Samoa. I like to think that, anyway. I look upon that as a cap lost.
``Yes, the injury was a bit of a killer. I had hung around for long enough
waiting for the opportunity to show what I could do. Kenny retired and then I
got injured, but you have to show the strength of character to come through an
experience like that.''
However, back to the business in hand. ``The main thing is to win the game
today and then the points will, hopefully, come. If we win, we can finish first
equal and if we lose on points difference, then so be it.
``Even if that were to happen, I reckon we would still have had a good season.
The problem has been losing to teams that we should have beaten. We've beaten
all the top sides and I still reckon that we're the best side in Scotland.
``To beat Heriot's by 43 points isn't impossible and we'll die in the attempt,
but you would have to say if you were being honest that it's improbable. We can
score 43 points but, by the law of averages, you would expect   Heriot's to
score some as well.''
Heriot's FP director of rugby Fraser Dall said yesterday that his side would
certainly not lack motivation. Heriot's would not be running on to their own
Goldenacre patch simply to make up the numbers.
But the hosts will be missing three leading players. Full back Stuart Lang
damaged his collar-bone at an Edinburgh squad session but is included in the
Edinburgh side to play South tomorrow; winger Cameron Glasgow has a hamstring
strain; and captain and tighthead prop Stuart Paul is also on the injury list.
Stirling are at full strength, with the exception of prop John Manson, who was
sent off last Sunday following a stamping incident in the South v North and
Midlands district championship game at Murrayfield.
Heriot's FP - C Aitken; D Fowler, D Stoddart, D Officer, E Bunney; P Smith, F
McMillan; M Livingstone, K Milne, A Binnie, P Young, J Turnbull, S Elliot, T
McVie, G Dall.
Stirling County - C Sangster; A Turner, I Jardine, M McGrandles, K Logan; M
McKenzie, K Harper; J Gibson, K McKenzie, B Robertson, S Hamilton, M Norval, G
Mackay, G Flockhart, B Ireland.
.ALL 21 England players in the squad for today's match against Western Samoa
have signed contracts with the       Rugby Football Union, which will bring
regular internationalists a guaranteed #36,000 this season.
Will Carling led the way by being first to sign the new deal, and now he wants
to concentrate on the Twickenham showdown, as England attempt to arrest a run
of three successive defeats.
``Nothing else will come to us unless we perform on the pitch and it is on
Twickenham rather than the team-meeting room that I am concentrating,'' said
Carling.
The captain is already impressed by newcomers Matt Dawson and Paul Grayson,
both winning their first caps, and Graham Rowntree, who is chosen on merit at
loose-head prop for the first time.
England beat Western Samoa 44-22 in the World Cup Group matches - but
weaknesses were revealed in England's defence.
``Western Samoa tried to hit the ball-carrier at the point where he is carrying
the ball, that means around chest high,'' added Carling. ``We must ensure that
our ball-retention stands up to their unusual tactic.''

GRAEME Smith and Fraser Walker both set Scottish records at the Uncle Ben's
Winter Challenge in Sheffield yesterday - but each failed to strike gold.
For Smith, the European Championship silver medallist and defending champion, a
Scottish record of 14min 49.71sec still left him an astonishing nine seconds
behind the winner, Leeds' Ian Wilson, whose 14-40.69 was almost seven seconds
inside the old British record.
Walker lowered his own Scottish record in the 50m back-stroke to 26.46sec but
had to settle for fifth. Neil Willey won in a British record 24.88.
q.BRYAN Morgan, the Dunfermline High schoolboy, collected the 50m back-stroke
title in a British junior record 28.46, at yesterday's Scottish Winter
Championships at Ayr.
Scholarship students Susan Colling and Pauline McLean completed a Stirling
University double. Colling won the 800m free-style in 9-06.08, while McLean
held off double Olympian Alison Sheppard to win the 50m back-stroke in 30.36.
Sheppard, five days after returning from six weeks' training in Canada, struck
gold in the 200m medley and 50m free-style. Winners:
Men: 50m butterfly - C Black (Arbroath St Thomas) 26.01. 50m back-stroke - B
Morgan (Carnegie) 27.32. 50m breast-stroke - J-P Shearer (Inverclyde) 30.70.
50m free-style - A Pullan (Leatherhead) 23.99. 200m medley - I Edmond
(Aberdeen) 2min 10.72sec. 1500m free-style - A Lane (Stirling) 16-14.28.
Women: 50m butterfly - G Anderson (Eastwood) 30.55. 50m back-stroke - P McLean
(Stirling) 30.36. 50m breast-stroke - B Robertson (Aberdeen) 34.95. 50m
free-style - A Sheppard (Milngavie &amp; Bearsden) 26.03. 200m medley - Sheppard

BTRAFALGAR House shook the City with full-year losses nearly twice some
estimates at #321m as new chief executive Nigel Rich discovered a virtual can
of worms as contracts were put under the microscope and major assets were
written down to more realistic values.
Put more formally, chairman Simon Keswick blamed inadequate leadership, lack of
operational control and weak financial disciplines but added that he is
confident of making real progress this year.
However, the belief that the #204m of exceptional costs are truly the last
after the 1993 total of #397m written off helped the shares recover part of
their initial 3!sp fall to close 2p easier on the day at 24!sp.
That capitalises the Ordinary shares at #263m to leave Trafalgar in that
unhappy category where the market value is less than the losses.
A renewal of support came from 26% shareholder Hongkong Land which so far has
invested almost #600m in Trafalgar as well as the prestige of the Keswick
family.
But given the size of the order book which rose #500m year on year to #3300m
and the high skill levels in the engineering and construction divisions, many
believe the shares could be an interesting speculation on a medium-term view.
Although there will be a seasonal increase in debt in the first six months to
next March, debt is not a severe problem, particularly if more assets are sold
off such as the US property and housing activities. But those who stumped up
for the #425m Preference share funding at 100p in the beginning of 1994 are
feeling pretty sore with the stock now trading at 48!sp and seeing the dividend
being passed and with little real hope of receiving anything for perhaps three
years. In any case there are no distributable reserves with there being a total
net loss of #382m.
Mr Rich, who bought 500,000 Trafalgar shares at 78p and so has a string-vested
interest in recovery, said that Cunard was going nowhere when he arrived. It
was also hit by the disastrous QE2 refit which resulted in #8m of passenger
compensation claims.
The ships were unable to meet their targets and the value of the brand name was
being wasted so that there was a #16m operating loss before the compensation
compared with the 1994 profit of #8m. The fleet is being written down by #79m
with another #31m being taken for restructuring costs.
Consultants were put in late last year and by April were able to clarify the
position on the leading engineering and construction contracts.
The lack of controls under previous managements seems to be breathtaking with
Trafalgar having 700 operating subsidiaries, but it was impossible for top
management to discover how they were performing.
John Brown power engineering was hard hit by the problems of the Keadby plant
where the General Electric turbines had a large design fault. These had to be
returned to the US for re-engineering and the subsequent six-month delay on the
#250m contract where there appears to have been no recourse to suppliers helped
push the division from #13m profit into #69m loss.
The Clydebank-based operation is now much less ambitious, going for lower-risk
and smaller contracts which have reduced its order book while 23 supervisory
managers have departed.
Davy had a similar tale of woe with a deficit totalling #84m including #20m of
contract losses.
But there are bright spots such as the John Brown chemical engineering
activities where expansion in Asia is paying substantial dividends and at Ideal
Homes which doubled its profits to #19m and is a nice little nest egg for
future disposal.
However, there are more job losses to come in addition to the 620 already
announced and Trafalgar is going to be an unhappy place as the remedial surgery
begins.

PETER Wright, Boroughmuir's international prop, who has now completed the
six-week ban for verbal abuse of referee Kenny McCartney during his side's
premiership clash against Gala, comes straight back into the Edinburgh side to
play South of Scotland at Meggetland tomorrow.
Wright comes into the side which lost to the Exiles but which defeated Ulster
in last weekend's friendly. Wright's Meggetland team-mate, Scotland under-21
scrum half Graeme Beveridge, is on the bench, with Graham Burns of
Stewart's-Melville in the side. Team:
N Mardon (Boroughmuir); F Henderson, S Hastings (both Watsonians), D Wyllie
(Stewart's Melville), S Lang (Heriot's FP); A Donaldson (Currie), G Burns
(Stewart's Melville); G Wilson (Boroughmuir), G McKelvie (Watsonians), P
Wright, D Burns (both Boroughmuir), S Murray (Edinburgh Academicals), C Mather
(Watsonians), B Ward (Currie), D Clark (Stewart's Melville).
Replacements - R McNulty (Stewart's Melville), D Lindsay (Musselburgh), M McVie
(Edinburgh Academicals), G Beveridge, D Laird (both Boroughmuir), A N Other.
q.THE senior clubs pressing for club participation in next season's European
Cup, as opposed to the SRU plan for Districts to fly the Saltire, have been
further angered by the Union's statement this week that the district route is
now a ``decision'' and not a ``proposal''.
An official challenge leading to an extraordinary general meeting of the Union
looked even more likely last night as Boroughmuir secretary Norman Bryson
declared: ``We will have to examine the SRU constitution to determine whether
they have the power to make such a decision.''

THE phrase ``Christmas is a time for remembering'' becomes truer every year, so
much that it now has official cliche status. If there's one thing that
Christmas does not stand for at this time, it's worshipping. Born-again
Christians, for a change, are absolutely right in this respect.
Compared to America, BACs are very much a minority, and you have only to look
at America to know that this is a good thing. Their lack of insight into world
events is similar to their lack of fashion sense, and could be inferred about a
group of people who can believe that the meek should inherit the earth while
simultaneously demanding the right to carry a sub-machine gun in self-defence.
Despite all this, Christians are right about today's pagan approach to
Christmas. Their ``original message of Christmas'' (ie that stables aren't such
bad places after all) has been buried under a mountain of crass commercialism
and syrupy emotion.
Come midnight next Sunday, church pews will be full of shell-suited infidels
and, instead of hymns that ring emptily, there will be gutsy, beery breathed
renditions of the old Christmas favourites. Songs so good they're almost worth
sitting through a sermon for.
``Real'' Christians can get their parkas in a twist about it, but it's a fact
of life that Joe Soap is happy to hang around for a yuletide fix of religion,
as long as that's where it stays. As soon as the last strains of Silent Night
have died out, Joe will be off down the road with the rest of the Soap family,
looking forward to a day off work spent in front of the telly.
This is a time of year packed with emotion, more usually excruciating
embarrassment which surfaces every time the kids yell ``Daddy, when am I
getting another present?'' every time a visitor calls. Even back in the
seventies, when an opulent Christmas meant getting Mousetrap and Cleudo, the
world was full of killjoys sanctimoniously intoning that ``kids nowadays really
get too much, don't they?''
As I've got older I've realised that these are usually the people who feel
outdone on the present front. Having spent twice as much on your kids as you've
suggested, their faces fall when they see your living room looking like a
Fisher Price toy graveyard. Having, in their eyes, been outdone they can only
grab the moral high ground while inwardly resolving to start saving for next
year.
Tradition is the main driving force in Christmas festivities. Why do something
you enjoy, when you can instead do something that you've always done? This
slavishness to custom is what makes us eat certain foods, drink mulled wine,
and it can be the only credible reason why they buy records by Cliff Richard in
great quantity.
Religious people can moan about the syrupy sentimentality of Christmas, but
that's what keeps the collection plates full: religious observance is all part
of the Christmas package - albeit a minor one. It doesn't matter that no-one
goes to church any more; come the school nativity plays, every dad in the
country will have a lump in the throat.
Men who haven't seen the inside of a church for years will be close to tears
when they see their kids acting out a Bible story. Never mind that
baby-in-the-hay nonsense: look, there's our Kelly-Marie dressed up as a tree!
This has more to do with a worship of our past than a worship of God. These
guys don't care about any religion, they're too busy remembering their own
childhood.
For them, the real meaning of Christmas is nostalgia: glorified, sugary, sickly
nostalgia. If they weren't so busy getting into debt in order to create
Christmas nostalgia for their own kids, they'd stop and wonder what the hell
they were doing. Some sociologists think that this whole midwinter madness is
just a traditional Celtic way of trying to forget that it's been dark for the
past two months. I don't believe this.
Christmas is a time for remembering. No matter how bad things are now, we can
all remember at least one childhood Christmas when we had more toys, food, and
sweets than we could have dreamed possible. To make things even better, we
thought that it was a happy, unconditionally loving Santa that was setting all
this up.
In our subconscious, the Scalextrix and the Tiny Tears dolls were signs that a
higher force not just existed, but cared about each one of us. If you could
always believe in Santa, you really wouldn't need a God. If you can't believe
in him, then the next best thing is to watch your kids revel in their belief.

YORKSHIRE Electricity, one of the dwindling number of English electricity
companies (RECs), has received a number of approaches but no actual bid talks
have taken place, according to director Brian Morgan.
The group would be prepared to talk to a potential bidder but did not believe a
merger could be justified.
``The sort of savings we anticipate you could obtain from a merger with another
REC or a water firm doesn't seem to us to justify the 30%-type of premium you
would anticipate having to pay,'' Mr Morgan commented.
Yorkshire yesterday confirmed its second massive dividend bonus this year. It
is to pay shareholders a special 100p-per-share bonus on top of its normal
interim payout of 11.88p, compared with 7.92p in the corresponding period last
year.
The announcement of the second special bonus was first made in October,
although it still has to be approved by shareholders. Pre-tax profits grew to
#110.6m for the six months to September, from #97.6m. Earnings per share jumped
10p to 45p.
In January, the Leeds-based group paid a 90p-per-share bonus dividend, which
cost it #188m, while the latest payout will amount to #184m after a recent
share consolidation programme.
Yorkshire chairman Christopher Hampson said the results demonstrated an
excellent performance in the face of a tightening regulatory regime.
``Our strategy is clear, namely to continue to build an efficient and
profitable energy business which will benefit both investors and customers.
``Accordingly, we intend through our performance to demonstrate the strength of
the company as an independent Yorkshire-based business,'' he said.

WILLIE ANDERSON
Snow Falling on Cedars, David Guterson (Bloomsbury, #5.99),
The Moor's Last Sigh, Salman Rushdie (Jonathan Cape, #15.99)
BOOKSELLERS are in a privileged position to choose from a wide variety of
immediately available books, but this does not protect them from the increasing
dross that some publishing houses are foisting on the public. Dross most
certainly cannot describe Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson, which is
one of the most accomplished first novels I have read in a long time. His
language and his powers of description to evoke the still pervasive sense of
mistrust in the States towards their citizens of oriental extraction make this
a book to be enjoyed by all.
The Moor's Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie is a novel by an author at his best. It
should have won this year's Booker Prize. It will certainly last longer in
people's memory.
HUGH BARNES
The Creature In The Map, Charles Nicholl (Jonathan Cape, #18.99)
So I Am Glad, A L Kennedy (Jonathan Cape, #9.99)
Son To The Father, Tony Peake (Little Brown, #15.99),
THE best non-fiction book I read this year was The Creature In The Map by
Charles Nicholl which marvellously reconstructed Sir Walter Raleigh's 1595
journey in search of the lost golden city of El Dorado.
In fiction, I enjoyed A L Kennedy's So I Am Glad for its mixture of love story,
allegory, fantasy and satire, and for the transforming enchantment of its
Glasgow streets, as well as Son To The Father by Tony Peake, a brilliant and
rapturous book about human relationships. This is a political novel in the best
sense: it's about the moral considerations at the root of political ideas, and
about chapter as an embodiment of moral nature.
IAN BELL
Dirt &amp; Deity - a Life of Robert Burns, Ian McIntyre (HarperCollins, #20)
The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson - Volume Eight (Yale, #29.95)
The Moor's Last Sigh, Salman Rushdie, (Jonathan Cape, #15.99)
Tom Paine - A Political Life, John Keane (Bloomsbury, #25)
Paul Celan - Poet, Survivor, Jew; John Felstiner (Yale, #19.95)
IN a thin year full of tired gambits and dull writing I admired Ian McIntyre's
sane and clear-sighted Dirt &amp; Deity - a Life of Robert Burns. Simultaneously I
was awed, yet again, by the art and energy of RLS in The Letters of Robert
Louis Stevenson -Volume Eight and cheered (though this country barely deserves
him) by Salman Rushdie's superb The Moor's Last Sigh.
Two other books which left me just a little richer for the experience of
reading, meanwhile, were John Keane's Tom Paine -A Political Life and John
Felstiner's Paul Celan -Poet, Survivor, Jew. Each, in their different ways,
proof of the endurance of ideas.
STEVE BRUCE
Whit, Iain Banks (Little Brown, #16)
Scotland - the Brand David McCrone, Angela Morris and Richard Kiely (Edinburgh
University Press, #12.95)
Farmer's Diary Volume IV, Charlie Allan (Ardo Publishing, Methlick, #11.95)
IAIN Banks just gets better. Whit is humorous, humane and, considering it is
about a sheltered young girl coming of age in a religious commune, something of
a thriller.
With tourism soon to become our largest industry, David McCrone, Angela Morris
and Richard Kiely's Scotland - the Brand is timely. A study of ``heritage''
producers such as the National Trust and Tourist Board, it broadens into
provocative reflections on the link between Scotland's lack of a state and its
representation as a product for paying customers.
The Herald's Charlie Allan has long entertained ``toonsers'' who dream of the
rural idyll and farmers who can read with his weekly accounts of a small
farmer's working life. Farmer's Diary Volume IV is now in the shops or
available by post (as are the first three collections).
DEIRDRE CHAPMAN
Shards of Memory, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (John Murray, #15.99)
Eveless Eden, Marianne Wiggins (Flamingo, #12.99)
Wonder Boys, Michael Chabon (Fourth Estate, #15.99)
THE books that impressed me this year all had a wide canvas and an offbeat way
of attacking it. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's Shards of Memory is an untraditional
dynastic novel about an American/European/Indian family, living lives of
freedom and creativity, drawing on all these sources.
Marianne Wiggins's Eveless Eden made use of the catacylsmic news events of the
years 1986-91 to turn a powerful love-story-cum-thriller between a foreign
correspondent and a photographer into a metaphorical warning about our
emotional values.
And Michael Chabon's Wonder Boys, a tale of life glimpsed through dope and
chronic detachment, was the funniest book I've read in years.

Edith Wharton Abroad, edited by Sarah Bird Wright (Robert Hale, #15.99)
Leading the Blind: a Century of Guide Book Travel 1815-1914, Alan Sillitoe
(Macmillan, #15.99)
TRAVEL literature broadens the mind. The genre has a distinguished pedigree -
from the seventeenth century onwards it was de rigueur for peripatetic
belletrists to include travel writing in their canons - but today the challenge
is coming up with an angle.
Someone has been everywhere and everyone has been somewhere, so it's no longer
enough to visit and describe, as in Edith Wharton Abroad (edited by Sarah Bird
Wright), unless you have a fashionable name. A century on, however, the elegant
prejudices and controlled enthusiasm of Wharton's selected travel writings
(1888 to 1920) reveal more than the guide books she despised.
But look what she missed by neglecting the mighty Baedecker: a seam of social
history and polemical geography which has been mined by Alan Sillitoe in
Leading the Blind: a Century of Guide Book Travel 1815-1914. Sillitoe is a
collector of early guide books, and his creative excavations make an angel of
an angle.
MICHAEL FRY
Max Havelaar, written under the pen-name of Multatuli by EW Dekker, (Penguin
Classics #7.99)
FOR me the most intriguing new novel was an old one, originally published in
1860, but out this year in Penguin Classics. Max Havelaar, written under the
pen-name of Multatuli by E W Dekker, is intriguing because it is Dutch, and we
do not get to read too many Dutch novels. It is autobiographical, and concerns
the downfall of a young colonial official, a tearaway with a heart of gold. It
has a splendid villain, Batavus Droogstoppel, working within a complex
structure where he never actually meets the hero.
What struck me most, however, was its uncanny resemblance to George Douglas
Brown's The House with the Green Shutters, in showing a society where all hopes
are blighted by narrow provincial complacency. In this respect, Calvinist
Holland of the nineteenth century seems to have been much like Calvinist
Scotland.
CLARE HENRY
Art is the Flower, Pamela Robertson (Pavilion, #14.99)
Whistler: Drawings, Pastels and Prints (Yale UP, #95)
Angels, Archangels and all the Company of Heaven, Gottfried Knapp (Prestel,
#9.95)
ART is the Flower is the whimsical title of an excellent, beautifully
illustrated book on Charles Rennie Mackintosh's botanical watercolours. These
are his most popular images and a firm favourite of mine too. The book is by
Glasgow Hunterian's resident Mackintosh expert, Pamela Robertson. Another major
artist with Glasgow links is Whistler whose archive and bequest of pictures is
based at Glasgow University. Margaret MacDonald, a world expert, has spent 25
years on this irascible, eccentric, notorious but giant figure and distilled
her knowledge into the catalogue raisonne: Whistler: Drawings, Pastels and
Prints from Yale UP at #95. Comprehensible but readable.
Looking for an angel? Then Gottfried Knapp's Angels, Archangels and all the
Company of Heaven, with its glossy images from great paintings from Raphael,
Botticelli, Velasquez and Rubens to Rodin and Klee, is great value and just
right for a sentimental, frivolous Christmas.
ALEXANDER LINKLATER
The Crossing, Cormac McCarthy (Picador, #6.99)
Morvern Callar, Alan Warner (Jonathan Cape, #9.99)
Bunkerman, Duncan McLean (Jonathan Cape, #9.99)
CORMAC McCarthy's The Crossing did more than just survive the critical acclaim
which attended its predecessor, All the Pretty Horses. It made praise
superfluous. The near-biblical rhythms of his prose, the pounding dialogue, and
McCarthy's lonely picture of the world's enmity and darkness set it beyond the
reach of its commentaries. Alan Warner's Morvern Callar was the year's most
impressive debut. Morvern is a superbly cool and resourceful character. Her
expedient morality suppresses a despair which is given form in Warner's
entirely original picture of a grim West Coast of Scotland and rave-coast of
the Mediterranean.
And Duncan McLean has done something equally new to the Scottish North-east. In
gradually pushing its janitor protagonist towards psychosis, Bunkerman takes a
brilliantly unflinching, wrong-way look down the telescope of male sexuality.
JOHN MACLEOD
Rose Madder, Stephen King (Hodder Headline #15.99)
Virtually Normal: an argument about homosexuality, Andrew Sullivan (Picador,
#14.99)
The Missing Days, Kenneth C Steven, (Scottish Cultural Press, #4.95)
GRIPPER of the year: Stephen King's Rose Madder. I'd never read anything by
King, the world's best selling writer. I don't think you could dismiss his work
as pulp fiction; it is far too well written, and hard to despatch in a hurry.
Still, it is King: very dark, very chilling. When I reviewed this I said I'd
never read another Stephen King. I lied. I've since read two.
Best non-fiction: Andrew Sullivan's Virtually Normal: an argument about
homosexuality. Sullivan is working-class, right-wing, Roman Catholic and gay.
Confused? Maybe, and I couldn't agree with his conclusions, but his essay is
tightly reasoned, beautifully penned, and marked by a rare tolerance.
Kenneth C Steven's 1995 anthology of poems, The Missing Days is a delight.
Every one a gem, and for 56 poems a bargain at the price.
GEORGE McKECHNIE
Gladstone, Roy Jenkins (Macmillan, #20)
ON November 24, 1879 as he approached the age of 70, Gladstone began the first
of his legendary Midlothian campaigns progressing by train from Liverpool to
Edinburgh with intermediate station speeches at Carlisle (an audience of 500),
Hawick (4000) and Galashiels (8000).
It was dark when he reached Edinburgh, but ``the scene even to the West End of
the city was extraordinary both from the numbers and the enthusiasm''.
In his massive biography Gladstone, Roy Jenkins vividly captures the towering
magnetism of the great Victorian statesman and leaves us in little doubt that
by comparison the leaders of today are but political pygmies.
Jenkins recalls that during his first Midlothian adventure it was calculated
that Gladstone had addressed ``in 30 speeches and over a 15 day circuit the
precise figure of 86,930 people''.
A century on it is almost impossible to comprehend the prodigious energy,
output and oratory of Gladstone but Jenkins does manage to reduce him to the
status of mere mortal as he explores Gladstone's personal and family life, and
the anguish he had with his social and moral crusades.

The Siren and Selected Writings, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa (Harvill Press,
#14.99)
The Masterless Men, J K Mayo (Macmillan, #14.99)
Ringan Gilhaizie, John Galt (Canongate Classics, #6.99)
FIRST, The Siren and Selected Writings by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. The
Sicilian aristocrat Lampedusa wrote The Leopard, a powerful elegy for his
island, and the finest European novel of the century. He didn't produce much
else of note - but some of his better bits and pieces have been gathered in
this collection, intelligently introduced by his biogra-

pher, the Scottish writer David Gilmour. A thin book full of fat pleasures.
Sicily also looms in The Masterless Men, the fifth and best of J K Mayo's Harry
Seddall novels. This thriller is a little cruel, unremittingly readable, and
imbued with a terrific sense of place.
Finally, Canongate Classics have issued a good, no-nonsense paperback edition
of Ringan Gilhaizie, John Galt's turbulent tale, written in 1823, of the
Scottish Reformation. This gutsy novel manages to be cerebral, tempestuous and
shocking all at once.
WILLIAM RUSSELL
Konin, A Quest by Theo Richmond (Jonathan Cape, #18.99)
Writing Home, Alan Bennett (Faber and Faber, #7.99)
MOVING, beautifully written, Theo Richmond's account of the life and death of
Konin, the small Polish town from which his Jewish ancestors came, puts the
Holocaust in its human context. We know how the Jews died, this shows the
centuries-old way of life the Nazis destroyed with them. Richmond's parents
emigrated to Britain before the First World War and he had never been to Konin
until he started searching for his roots. His discoveries in Konin, A Quest by
Theo Richmond bring home the full horror of the Nazis' crimes against humanity.
One of the most endearing collections of memoirs and assorted writings ever
made, Alan Bennett's Writing Home is sad, funny, outrageous, opinionated and
provocative. His memoir of the Lady in the Van, who camped in squalour in his
front garden for years, is masterly, but it is the diaries which delight most.
JOHN RYAN
Donkey's Years, Aidan Higgins (Secker &amp; Warburg, #14.99)
Byrne, Anthony Burgess (Hutchinson, #14.99)
The Collected Nature Stories, Henry Williamson (Little, Brown and Company,
#12.99)
AN autobiography, funny, sad and so brutally truthful that it reads like
fiction was a revelation; Donkey's Years by Aidan Higgins spares no one from
his eccentric family in the impoverished Big House as he grows up in Ireland
and beyond. From the days when families spent much time together, everyone will
recognise an oddball relative here.
A previously unpublished novel (his word) from the late Anthony Burgess turned
out to be a ribald tale in verse; Byrne, a down-at-heel poet, romances his
unholy and unorthodox way across the continents. Not for the politically
correct.
In large paperback format, The Collected Nature Stories of Henry Williamson
brings together evocative tales of wildlife from three earlier volumes written
just after the First World War when there were still some animals around.
Illustrated with the superb woodcuts of C.F Tunnicliffe from the first
editions, this delightful book is worth buying for these alone.
ANNE SIMPSON
Independence Day, Richard Ford (Harvill, 14.99)
Mr Ives' Christmas, Oscar Hijuelos (Bloomsbury, #15.99)
The Alienist, Caleb Carr (Warner Books, #7.99)
AT odds with all those who damn fathers as useless rogues, two powerful novels
from America remind us of life beyond man-hating agendas. Both Richard Ford's
Independence Day and Oscar Hijuelos' Mr Ives' Christmas transport us through
emotional frailties and confusions to arrive at a point of self-discovery which
is dazzling in its perception and hope. Ford's Frank Bascombe, a puzzled
divorcee with a light-fingered son, has the literary stature of Updike's
Rabbit, but warmed by punchy compassion and fast wit.
Hijuelos' Ives is riven by grief for a murdered son, but his embattled ascent
from melancholy realism to restored belief in humankind is a modern parable;
troubled, tender, angry, a marvellous affirmation of decency in the hades of
New York. Also Caleb Carr's stupendous thriller, The Alienist. Three great
story-tellers at the lyrical summit of imagination.
GRAEME WOOLASTON
The Ghost Road, Pat Barker (Viking, #15)
Not Drowning but Waving, Peter Adam (Andre Deutch, #20)
AT first Pat Barker's The Ghost Road seemed a disappointing conclusion to her
First World War trilogy, with an over-elaborate symbolism surrounding
psychiatrist William Rivers's earlier career as an anthropologist in Melanesia.
But then the book moves to the Front itself, and what had previously been
unconvincing came together as profoundly moving. An immensely deserving Booker
prizewinner. Barker's account of the psychological after-effects the war left
on individuals makes it easier to understand why at least one European country
collapsed into collective madness, and Peter Adam's autobiography Not Drowning
but Waving begins there, with his childhood as a Mischling, a half-Jew, in Nazi
Germany. His story then ranges over a vast sweep of European culture, following
his career as a BBC documentary producer, but always chronicling with almost
painful honesty the lifelong uncertainty about his own identity which sprang
from that childhood.
KENNETH WRIGHT
The Borough, Danny Cannon (Serpent's Tail, #8.99)
Lost In Music, Giles Smith (Picador, #12.99)
White Chappell Scarlet Tracings, #5.99; Radon Daughters, #5.99; Downriver,
#6.99; Iain Sinclair (all Vintage)
THE best Glasgow novel in years is Danny Cannon's The Borough, a haunting tale
of small, quiet lives in the streets and bars of Partick, free of condescension
and of pseudo-proletarian bluster. The closing leap into fantasy is audacious
and achingly moving.
Giles Smith's Lost In Music, confessional of a lifelong affair with pop as
consumer and performer (please welcome The Cleaners From Venus!), is funny and
wistful. If you ever played air guitar or measured out your life in album
sleeves, this is the story of your life.
Iain Sinclair's phantasmagorical London trilogy White Chappell Scarlet
Tracings, Radon Daughters, and Downriver, is a fearfully strange voyage through
underground folklore and urban decay that reads like a Hammer film scripted by
the Kray twins on drugs. If these books were people, they'd be in Broadmoor.

Scotland has a creditable part in the movie pantheon. William Russell reports
on events planned for
the centenary
THE Flickers, the Movies, the Talkies, the Video! Scotland will celebrate the
centenary of the cinema next year with a series of splendid events - the
precise nature of which is not quite clear yet, because the Scotscreen 100
programme will not be officially launched until spring and most of the events
have still to be finalised. But, as they say in showbusiness, it is bound to be
all right on the night.
The English end of the festivities, Cinema 100, of which Scotscreen is an
adjunct, held its launch last month and announced one nationwide event. On the
great National One Pound day, Sunday, June 2, everyone can go to the pictures
for a pound a head. This has to be a bargain, although how good a bargain will
depend on what films the exhibitors are showing.
The London launch, chaired by Lord Attenborough, who presides over Cinema 100,
left the Scots organisers somewhat taken aback since, not only were they not
ready to do the same, they had not been warned what was coming in time to
cobble anything together.
The choice of 1996 for Britain's celluloid annus mirabilis - the rest of the
world celebrated the birth of the cinema this year, except for America which
did it two years ago - looks like rampant jingoism. There is no reason why
everyone could not have agreed on the same year, except amour propre - and a
desire not to let the French monoplise things.
Who actually invented moving pictures is open to dispute - the American Thomas
Edison, our own William Friese Green, not quite immortalised in a pretty
terrible British movie called The Magic Box; and one Max Skladanowsky can all
lay claim to have been the founding father - but the French, naturally, brook
no such nonsense. As far as they are concerned the answer is les freres Lumiere
who showed their films for the first time in the Salon Indien of the Grand Cafe
on the Boulevard des Capuchins in Paris on December 28, 1895.
As a result they have been celebrating like mad all year across the Channel, as
indeed have the BBC and many British newspapers. Somehow Cinema 100 failed to
get them to stay their hands. We picked 1996 because on March 7, 1896, films
were shown in Britain for the first time in the Alhambra, Leicester Square,
albeit films made by the Lumiere Brothers.
The first thrash organised by Cinema 100, the imaginatively titled Premiere of
the Century, will be held in London, naturally, and on March 7. It will, we are
assured, be attended by stars past and present, national and international -
and, of course, Lord Attenborough, the sine qua non of British cinema. A major
new film will be screened, although it is not yet decided what it will be, but
there are some British films in the offing which would be ideal. If it is an
American one then we know where we stand.
Whether there will be regional, provincial and Scottish versions of the
premire is yet to be decided, but the likelihood is that we, at least, will
wait for our own first screening dates and try to get something new and special
to show then.
As far as the celebrations here and south of the Border are concerned, one
cannot help feeling it is all a bit late in the day for so much to be still pie
in the sky. The main attractions which have been revealed do not, on the whole,
sad to say, actually thrill the blood. Cinema is nothing if it is not exciting,
innovative, controversial and entertaining, and the programme, while manifestly
worthy, is seldom any of those things individually or collectively.
First off the mark, however, with a really good idea is the Glasgow Film
Theatre. It is showing two silent films on December 28, Jean Vigo's portrait of
the high life on the Riviera, A Propos de Nice, and Rene Clair's comedy about a
mad inventor who attempts to place the French capital in a state of suspended
animation, Paris Qui Dort, to mark that first Lumiere Brothers performance.
It will be an occasion not to miss because the silent cinema, which has much to
offer, does not translate well to the television screen and opportunities to
see silents properly projected and with the right musical accompaniment, an
essential element for their enjoyment, are rare. The music will be provided by
Adrian Johnston, described by GFT as ``a one-man band,'' for which relief from
the ubiquitous Carl Davis we should all be grateful.
The two key Scottish dates are April 13 and May 26, when the films were first
shown in Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively. The Edinburgh screenings were held
in what is now the Festival Theatre, Nicholson Street - then the Empire Palace.
In Glasgow they were shown in The Skating Palace, Sauchiehall Street - now the
MGM multiplex. It was to become, over the years, the home of the Panorama,
Hengler's Circus, the Waldorf Dance Hall, the Regal Cinema and then the ABC
cinema.
One plan is that on April 13 every cinema in Scotland will show a film with a
Scottish connection, a worthy aim, except that the majority of feature films
about Scotland are probably best forgotten, the historical ones in particular
being mostly claptrap and good only for a laugh.
A Scottish Screen Festival, the first-ever devoted to Scottish film in
Scotland, run in conjunction with Bafta Scotland, is being held in the
MacRobert Arts Centre, Stirling, from April 18 to 21. Dame Diana Rigg is chair
of the committee organising the junket - just the job for a great Mother
Courage - which will end with what Linda Pearson of Bafta described as a
Scottish parliament. This gathering, it is hoped, will try to chart the way
ahead for film in Scotland.
The Edinburgh International Film Festival celebrates its 50th anniversary this
year and its programme will tie in with the centenary. The director, Mark
``gorgeous'' Cousins, as he is known in London film circles, is planning to run
a section called ``Films that Changed the World''. He also wants to transform
Edinburgh Castle green, making it into the Emerald City in Oz, to mark the
anniversary. Somehow one cannot see the city fathers falling for such an
innovative idea. For starters, it would kill the tartans at the tattoo! But
Mark is on the right track. A few more daft, amusing and provocative ideas like
that are needed.
Also in August, one of the blatant gaps in the film book market should be
filled when David Bruce's Scotland, The Movie Book is published by Polygon to
coincide with the Film Festival. In the form of a gazetteer, it will be a
personal view of the history of the first hundred years of cinema in Scotland.
There are also 31 Centenary Plaques being put up throughout Scotland, marking
places associated with great Scottish filmmakers, performers, exhibitors and
cinemas.
The stars, at least a couple of whom are still alive, include Donald Crisp
(Aberfeldy), Jack Buchanan and Deborah Kerr (Helensburgh), Sean Connery (The
Conference Centre, Edinburgh), Duncan Macrae (Maryhill) and Finlay Currie
(Inveraray). The institutions include the New Picture House, Campbeltown; the
Synod Hall, Edinburgh; the Glen Cinema, Paisley; and the Capitol Cinema,
Aberdeen.
The great Scottish film exhibitor families will be marked by plaques to George
Singleton and the Cosmo (GFT) and the Pooles of Synod Hall fame (Saltire Court,
Castle Terrace, Edinburgh). Among the directors, Alexander Mackendrick, will be
commemorated by one at Castlebay, Barra; Bill Douglas by one at Newcraighall,
and the filmmaker Norman McLaren by one at 21 Albert Place, Stirling, or
possibly the Glasgow School of Art.
A new tourist map showing where films made in Scotland were shot is planned in
conjunction with the Scottish Tourist Board. You can see where the Maggie
puffed, whisky was galore, Liam Neeson went skinny dipping in Rob Roy and
Margaret Leighton and David Niven went over the sea to Skye among other things.
Among other events:
n.Bafta is planning a series of master classes on film which will be held at
universities and other institutions of higher learning.
n.Scotland is to film Scotland. Scottish Television is asking people to send in
videos of their lives on centenary day, April 13, which will then be shown on
the telly.
n.In October, if the National Lottery money turns up in time, the cine-deprived
people of the Highlands will be provided with the UK's first Cinemobile which
will tour the region, bringing movies to the people.
n.There is to be a touring exhibition round the cinema foyers of Scotland which
will reflect the experiences of those who worked in cinemas from the pioneering
days up to the age of the multiplex.
n.The Scottish Film Archive is plundering its treasures and sending out a
series of films from the silent era showing events of the day which were filmed
by local cinema managers - who thought the video was something new? - which
will be shown round the commercial circuits.
The Flickers went down a bomb with Scots right from the start, and a
cinema-going tradition was established which has survived the onslaught of
television. Today Scotland is still the UK's major market for films outside
London. Going to the cinema proved more popular in Scotland than anywhere else
in Britain and by 1920 there were 557 cinemas showing films.
By 1930 Scotland had 634 cinemas, of which 127 were in Glasgow, 39 in
Edinburgh, 27 in Dundee and 15 in Aberdeen. They did not all flourish, however,
because competition was fierce and the coming of sound was to spell the end for
many of them. In Glasgow alone, in the immediate aftermath of its arrival, 15
cinemas closed, unable to afford the new equipment. Glasgow was the first place
to get the talkies when on January 7, 1929, The Singing Fool was presented at
the Coliseum in Eglinton Street.
By 1937, Glasgow had 98 cinemas with a seating capacity of 133,659, 12 theatres
and three music halls. So it continued, more or less, until the 1950s when the
arrival of television drastically reduced their number. Today Glasgow has 24
screens, although not in 24 individual cinemas, while Edinburgh has 29 screens,
and Scotland as a whole, at a rough count, has 152 screens in some 60 sites,
housed in the new custom-built multiplexes or old picture palaces which have
been subdivided.
The first film review appeared in 1907 in The Scotsman and people like me
started to earning a living. It has, some would say, been downhill ever since.
Scotland had some glorious picture palaces, of which Glasgow's Green's
Playhouse, with its legendary golden divans where many a romance bore fruit,
was probably the finest. But everyone brought up in the years when the cinema
was the principal source of entertainment has their favourite picture house.
Today's bright young cineastes who enthuse about old movies only know the half
of it. You have to have seen them where they were meant to be shown to fully
appreciate them. In the 1930s, Lanark, with a population of around 7000, had
three cinemas, which gives some indication of the thrall the medium held the
population in.
One, the Electric, was burnt down before I was of a cinema-going age in the
1940s, and was only remarkable for the fact that its ruins still stood and the
general belief that the fire had been an insurance job. The others were the Rio
in the Castlegate, the local fleapit, and the Regal at the top of the town,
which was posh and had a cafe attached. In those days the manager wore evening
dress at night and the usherettes, who showed you to your seat in the stalls or
the circle, wore smart claret-coloured uniforms, while similarly clad doormen
prowled the foyer keeping the queues in order.
Carluke had a splendid pile called The Windsor, owned by the family who owned
the Rio. It had a fantastic facade made of orange brick which looked like
something out of the Arabian Nights, or, to be more accurate, the Arabian
nightmare. The theme did not get beyond the foyer.
Some palaces are derelict, others have been cruelly subdivided into shoebox
auditoria, others replaced by supermarkets, filling stations and video stores.
Today's multiplexes have their good points, but they have no character, one is
the twin of the other.
What seems to be missing from the celebrations is a major exhibition devoted to
the glories of the picture palaces, to the costumes they wore and the dreams
they conjured up, and a really splendid party at which we could all dress up as
our favourite film fantasy - I'm going as Fred Astaire, while the office is
full of would-be Cruella de Villes and Big Men longing to put on a raincoat and
say Play it Again, Sam. So sit back, fasten your seatbelts and let's enjoy the
ride.

Gary C Buchanan visits a romantic retreat in a silver sea
APPROACHED from the air, Mauritius, with its rings of reefs, lagoons and white
beaches looks extremely like an oyster. Actually it is much bigger than the
largest-known oyster, being around 38 miles long by 29 miles wide.
No traveller flying over this giant oyster can remain insensitive to the blue
and green summits of the mountains that rise from the emerald plains. Legend
has it that a colony of giants who inhabited the great crescent of Lemuria
were
roaming the Capricorn Sea in search of the land of Paradise. They found
Mauritius, a magnificent land freshly built from the depth of the sea by
Vulcan.
Today, as you are driven to your resort hotel from the modern airport, bearing
the impossible name of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, it becomes immediately
apparent that the island grows sugar cane as its main business in life -
tourism comes in third, after manufacturing clothes from imported textiles.
Every available square foot of land is planted with the profitable weed, and
the 10-foot-high canes are to be found on every flat inch of the island,
except
for your hotel, the larger roads and the airport runway.
The road journey seems long after the 11-hour flight (non-stop with Air
Mauritius, one-stop with British Airways) but it provides a good glimpse of
Mauritian life in microcosm. Most of the population seems to tend the sugar,
living in little villages strung along the roads. The roadways have no
pavements but they do have storm gutters at the sides, consequently the entire
population walks, chats, snoozes and generally spends its time in the middle
of
the road.
Other hazards are brakeless bicycles (which have no lights at night),
bullock-carts full of cut cane, also with no brakes, ``biketiques'' - complete
shops piled on to the back of Hondas which always include a two-foot wide
glass
case displaying their wares - and few road signs.
Another, more subtle hazard to driving is the sheer beauty of the Mauritian
mixed population. The sudden entry into the field of vision of a saffron sari,
a graceful swaying walk, a pair of eyes smiling out at the world from beneath
the balanced bucket, is enough to cause the unwary traveller to steer into the
village banyan tree.
As you progress along the network of undulating roads you start wondering
which
continent you have actually travelled to. Lurid Hindu temples covered in
writhing psychedelic deities rise out of the sugar cane, around the next
corner
there is quite likely to be squatting a dour Presbyterian church more suited
to the Outer Hebrides, while on the corner itself is a Roman Catholic shrine -
with a grimy plastic Madonna peering through the tangled vines. Just to add to
the confusion, English is the official language, but everyone speaks a French
patois - and pay in rupees.
There is a charming blend of five different ethnic groups and it is this
surprising cultural mix that saves Mauritius from being just another idyllic,
but insipid holiday playground.
The island was first explored by Portuguese sailors during a spell of good
weather in 1505, but they didn't know quite what to make of it so they sailed
away again. According to another legend - Mauritius is full of them - they had
mistaken basking dodos for swans and called the place Island of the Swan, but
Portuguese sailors could hardly have been that stupid, could they?
The next wave of visitors were the Dutch, who began a modest settlement in
1598. They went in for dodo-bashing in a big way with wooden sticks, to such
an
extent that by 1680 there were none left - anywhere in the world. By 1710 the
Dutch, having named the island after their Prince
Maurice, decided it was time to leave and enjoy their new acquisition instead
-
the Cape of Good Hope.
In 1715 the French arrived, drums beating and claiming the island as theirs,
renaming it Ile de France. With Gallic shrewdness they built their main
harbour
on the calm side of the island, and Port Louis (from a king of the same name)
became a very important port, particularly with pirates, smugglers and slaves.
Then in 1810 General Abercrombie invaded the island and claimed it for
Britain;
and British it remained until 1968, enjoying all the benefits of English
grammar, dressing for dinner and driving on the left hand side of the road. In
1968 Mauritius was granted independence. Today Mauritians prefer speaking
French to English, but they do still drive on the left - except round corners.
Strict planning controls introduced by the government ensure that Mauritian
hotels blend in with the local surroundings without so much as a penthouse
peeping above the canopy of the tallest palm. So after the colourful drive
from
the airport your hotel creeps up on you as it emerges from the undergrowth.
Andrew and Fergie chose to party in paradise before the parting of their ways
-
their choice was Le Touessrok. Designed by a Mauritian architect to look more
like a Mediterranean village than a hotel, this little gem now boasts a York
beach and a York suite - may the memory linger on.
Le Touessrok has 200 whitewashed rooms and suites, more reminiscent of Mykonos
than Mauritius. Many of the rooms with white shutters and thatched roofs open
on to shaded alleyways in the peaceful solitude of their own island, joined to
the main hotel by a southern seas' version of the Rialto Bridge.
A little further north, but still on the east coast, lies a legend in southern
hemisphere hospitality - Le Saint Geran Hotel, Golf Club and Casino. This
deluxe retreat follows the Mauritian formula of merging the interior and
exterior. The elegant white hall of impressive height is awash with fresh
flowers and bids an almost Moorish welcome to its much-vaunted clientele of
royalty, celebrities and football stars.
Set in 35 acres on a beach that appears to go on forever, La Pirogue
accommodates its guests in bougainvillea-clad thatched cottages, each
positioned to capture the glorious sunsets across the Indian Ocean.
Life at La Pirogue revolves around its beach that meanders into infinity
between the horizon and the mountain as well as the crystal clear waters, just
teeming with big game fish. Enthusiasts return year after year to this part of
the world where experts can guarantee some of the biggest catches.
Smoked marlin, the Mauritian answer to smoked salmon - and the infinite range
of seafood, including fresh water Camarons, not to mention Chinese, Indian and
Creole dishes as varied as the islands population, feature prominently on the
lavish buffets which accompany a performance of the Sega, the national dance
of
Mauritius. This throbbing rhythm of drums and voices tugs at your hips and
heels - evoking the pulsebeat of the island as no other can.
With a climate of wraparound sun, the occasional short sharp shower to bring
out the smell of frangipani and stephanotis, a diet of the freshest fruits and
salty seafood, not to mention the delicious local rum, Mauritius has all the
ingredients for serious lotus-eating. Little wonder that the island is
attracting the cupid market - couples are happily trading aisle for isle and
choosing the giant oyster in the Indian Ocean.
Mark Twain wrote: ``God made Mauritius first, and then he made Heaven.'' For
weddings or honeymoons, Mauritius is not just another insipid playground - it
is isolated splendour. This island, 1000 miles south of the Seychelles, is the
latest topic of conversation in the ``honeymoon to beat all honeymoons''
circuit.
But you don't need the excuse of marital bliss to visit this model for heaven.
Truly Mauritius is delicious - if only they would drop the dead dodo.

OF all the mediums, the cinema has an atmosphere that is totally unique. Since
the early days of the twentieth-century there was no bigger treat for a child
than a visit to the local ``flicks''.
Whether it be at the local flea pit, or the luxurious picture palaces, the
children from all walks of life would be greeted by the manager and his staff.
The moment the lights were dimmed a cheer would raise the roof because they
were about to be taken on a journey into a different world where the goodies
would always triumph over the baddies.
1934 saw a new landmark in Scottish cinema watching when the first Mickey Mouse
Club, a Saturday show specially designed for children, opened at the New Tivoli
in Edinburgh. It did not take long for the other cinema chains throughout the
country to realise the potential of the idea and start up their own clubs or
run their own special matinee programmes.
The menu would consist of the usual mix of cartoons for starters. There would
also be comedies from favourites like Laurel and Hardy or the Three Stooges.
The main course would usually be a Western. Stars like Hopalong Cassidy and Roy
Rogers were just two of the cowboy matinee idols.
The biggest cheer would be when the bad guy got his just deserts or when the
seventh cavalry arrived at the very last minute to save the day. If however the
hero was in any danger, a common occurrence would be - horror of horrors! - the
projector breaking down. The eventual cheer signalled that it had been fixed
and the hero lived to fight another day.
Apart from the main feature, there were competitions. Popular examples were the
talent shows where the winner was decided on the strength of the crowd's
applause. These contests not only heightened the involvement of the audience,
it also gave the projectionist ample time to load the next film.
The final course would usually consist of a serial where the audience was left
on tenterhooks, having to come back the next week to see if the hero escaped in
one piece.
Two men who are well acquainted on the subject are filmmaker/historian Ian
Rintoul from Edinburgh and his colleague, Jack Pottage. Both promote the golden
age of the cinema in the shape of film shows and talks at venues around the
country. Ian also stages exhibitions on the subject of the cinema.
``Going to the cinema was such a special event for the children,'' he said. ``
You have to remember that in those early days there was no television and very
few children had a radio,'' added Pottage.
The cinema clubs, decline started during the 1960s because of competition from
television and a bigger demand for full-length feature films. A lot of the
smaller cinemas closed as a result. ``They did have morning matinees for the
kids in the big cinema chains like the ABC minors. Unlike the other children's
shows they had a set programme that travelled the circuit, whereas the small
individual cinema could not afford a different programme every week.''
A child's quest for action and adventure has been just as great since those
early days when pioneers like J J Bennell first launched his B B (Bright &amp;
Beautiful) Pictures. Today it is down to filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg
and George Lucas, whose blockbuster trilogies, such as the Star Wars and
Indiana Jones films have helped to lure children back to the cinema.
If only they could couple that special dark magic these films created alongside
the unique atmosphere and format the cinema clubs had to offer. Children would
encounter an experience that was so special, the memory would stay with them
for the rest of their lives.
Frank McGroarty laments the loss of   Saturday morning
children's clubs

n THIS little notebook from Amstrad is described as the world's
easiest-to-operate computer, and one which everyone can learn to use in fewer
than five minutes. Amstrad say they'll refund the money if it's an idle boast.
The Notebook NC200 is a full-function word processor with spellchecker,
calendar and diary, spreadsheet facility and some games included. It's also got
a printer port, full-sized keyboard and a backlit screen. The drive takes
standard disks and there's even slots for enhanced memory cards which can add
on another 256k.
At #300 (plus VAT), it looks like the middle ground between electronic
organisers and desktops, and it's pretty neat too.

PARKING in space is no easy matter, as the recent rendezvous of the space
shuttle with the Russian MIR station showed, but a team of Glasgow specialists
led by aerospace expert Dr Colin MacInnes are putting their brains to the
problem to help prevent mid-orbit shunts.
Space enthusiasts held their collective breath as the shuttle carried out the
tricky manoeuvre to dock safely with the large platform without breaking
anything.
As the shuttle approached MIR it had to follow a carefully planned path to
avoid damaging the station's solar panels or impacting on the station's docking
port at too high a speed. The catch as catch can manoeuvres are planned well
before launch and have to be implemented to a strict timetable once in orbit.
These problems, however will be even greater when the huge International Space
Station Alpha begins construction in 1997. Then American, Russian and
eventually European spacecraft will have to intercept the station and lock on
to Alpha's many docking ports and berthing points.
To overcome these difficulties the European Space Technology and Research
Centre, part of the European Space Agency, has funded a two-and-a-half-year
study at Glasgow University's Department of Aerospace Engineering to develop a
new automatic rendezvous and docking system.
The European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), which will transfer supplies to
space stations, will be able to use the new system to approach and dock largely
unaided. In addition, it will be a relatively easy matter to change the ATV
flight plan once in orbit.
The new system being developed uses a ``potential field method'' where
obstructions, such as the station's solar panels provide a virtual force,
pushing the ATV away. The ``virtual forces'' only exist in the flight computer,
but have proven to be a simple and extremely effective way of controlling
rendezvous and docking manoeuvres.

THE stress of caring for chronically ill relatives could be a health hazard. A
new study of women carers is showing that psychological stress can slow the
healing of wounds by as much as nine days.
The findings could be important in improving the recovery of patients following
surgery and lessening the chances of developing some post-surgical infections.
The research team led by Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, professor of psychiatry and
psychology in Ohio State University, compared how well skin wounds healed in a
group of more than two dozen older women. Half of the women were the principal
carers for relatives suffering dementia. The remaining women served as a
control group for the study.
All of the women were asked to complete a questionnaire which rated how
stressed they considered their daily lives. A sample of blood was also taken
from each woman at the beginning of the study and analysed to determine the
levels of Interleukin-1, an important blood factor involved in immunity.
A biopsy of a small piece of skin was also taken. The wound was then cleaned
and re-bandaged every day for the first week. After that, the women returned
every few days so that their wounds could be cleaned and photographed to
provide a record of healing.
At the end of the study, the carers' wounds took an average of nine days longer
to heal than did those of the women in the control group. The blood analysis
also showed that they also produced less Interleukin-1. The study also showed
that the changes in the rate of wound healing among the stressed women were
most apparent in the first two weeks after injury.
``That's very important,'' says Kiecolt-Glaser. ``If a patient is going to get
infections or other problems following surgery, that two-week period is when
you'd expect the worst to occur.''

LIKE Omar Sharif's entrance in Lawrence of Arabia, the future of cinema is now
shimmering upon the horizon. But desert landscapes have been replaced by
sprawling screens the size of tower blocks, seats which rock'n'roll, deafening
sound, and a picture quality to rival reality. It is the final form of the
future that now remains a blur. Sharif's Ali may have been a dot of sand and
dust, yet in tomorrow's world what is certain is that the pixels in each
picture will be polished to perfection.
If only the performances could be so digitally enhanced. We've already had
Humphrey Bogart advertise a soft drink he wouldn't have wasted on his whisky 30
years after it killed him. Why not resurrect a golden age of movie stars who'll
show them how it's done? Or are they already doing that with Clint Eastwood? In
the future - 10, 20, 100 years along the spool - will a bit-part actor off a TV
show become a legend?
In fact next year a digital double of Denzel Washington will perform all of the
most dangerous stunts in a film called Virtuosity. His images were scanned and
then manipulated to perform the more outrageous stunts - which a $7m star would
balk at.
And so to Britain where talents such as Alan Parker, Daniel Day Lewis, and John
Boorman burn brightly then are quickly shipped off in crates to stoke the big
pot-boilers in Hollywood. Could we see a day when Colin Welland's comments that
``The British are coming!'' upon collecting an Oscar for Chariots Of Fire could
be seen as a promise rather than a punchline?
If the Brothers Scott have anything to do with it, a fierce British film
industry will be reborn. Tony Scott, director of Crimson Tide, and brother
Ridley, director of Thelma and Louise, bought Shepperton Studios for just such
a purpose. And when will we establish a Scottish film school to nurture talents
who'll produce a churchyard of Shallow Graves?
Just who will these talents be? Flicking through the television channels are a
million actors who just might make it, thousands of writers and megaphones-ful
of directors. But to predict the future you can onlypeer into the past and then
work forward.
If Quentin Tarantino worked in a video shop and achieved Oscar-winning success
with Pulp Fiction, will the bubbly girl at the Azad store on Great Western Road
now win one for a remake of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest?
A more reliable form of shaping the future is for executive number crunchers to
peer into the swirl of old cinema ticket stubs. In America, where the
entertainment industry is the second biggest export, ticket sales are dropping.
Figures released by the National Association of Theatre Owners illustrated that
in 1991 and 1992 sales dropped below 1000 million for the first time since
1977.
The blame is stapled to the success of home entertainment systems; video,
CD-Roms, and laser discs which offer superb pictures and sound quality. The
release of Jurassic Park in 1993 forced ticket sales back up and executives to
realise that special-effect blockbusters will make people leave home.
And ever since Cinemascope was invented to beat off the fifties threat of
television, the cinema has been about the big-screen experience. So screens are
going to get bigger, much bigger. At the moment three companies are engaged in
a Godzilla battle over giant movie screens. Digital technology has revived the
spirits of Samuel Goldwyn and Louis B Mayer as movie moguls come out fighting.
In the right corner is the Imax Corporation - this Toronto-based company are
investing in giant-screen theatres such as the 650-seat theatre being built in
New York which will use a state-of-the-art 3D film process.
Viewers will strap on a lightweight headset with electronic glasses and tiny
speakers. The films shown on the giant multi-storey screens will be specially
shot but it is expected that in the future special prints of blockbuster movies
will be made available in such a format.
In partnership with Imax is special effects wizard Douglas Turnball who was the
designer and director of Universal Studios' Back To The Future ride and also
the mind behind the 2001: A Space Odyssey effects. Talking about the new style
of cinema images available with Imax he says: ``Imax is almost the real thing.
I was at a private screening for Destiny In Space where I spoke with some
astronauts who were on the Nasa mission which serviced the Hubble Telescope.
``They said that the Imax experience was so close to reality. In some respects
it was better because there weren't any restrictions such as helmets which
impair vision. They said the Imax film was replacing their visual memories of
what they saw in space. That's a pretty profound statement.''
And in the left corner limbering up is Iwerks Entertainment. The firm launched
by two former executives at Disney - Stanley B Kinsey and Donald W Iwerks - has
a slightly different market strategy. ``If you can excite them with rides and
special effects, they'll still come out,'' says Kinsey. In January 1994 they
launched the Cinetropolis complex at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut.
The idea is a series of small cinemas with 48-motion-base seats which move and
tilt to films like Supersonic Flight through a breakneck ride with Robocop and
an underwater adventure called SOS. Also in place is the Iwerks Fox Theatre
which has 60ft high images perfectly projected and a Cinedrome 360, a disco
with a video ``wallpaper''.
In The Loch Ness Experience, as the paying public explore the depths of the
Scottish waters from the comfort of Connecticut, Iwerks are attempting to
remove the word ``virtual'' from the development of ``virtual reality''. They
have teamed up with Ivan Sutherland, the father of VR, to develop a sensory
experience akin to the movie Lawnmower Man - except that no-one goes mad and
murders.
While both Iwerk and Imax battle for supremacy, tucked in another corner is
Showscam. For this firm the image is all. The Showscam film process creates an
astonishing level of quality which, as yet, nothing else has matched. Sharpness
is created by matching the speed of the film frame to the human eye. It is said
that the human eye perceives the world as if it were running at a film speed of
approximately 60 frames per second.
Conventional motion pictures operate at 24 frames per second while special
formats rise to 30 frames. Showscam projects 70mm film at an accelerated rate
of 60 frames per second which adds depth, clarity, and realism to the image.
The catchphrase is ``Don't Just Watch Movies - Experience Them''.
Pacific Bell has already invested millions in digitised movies. The company
hopes to beam digital flicks by fibre-optic lines to between 2000 and 3000
theatres, juggling eight trillion bits of data which are then reassembled and
projected by a high-definition ``film'' projector. This could eventually cut
$300m from distribution costs.
But what of the software which tomorrow's hardware will project or beam? A
generation of filmmakers on the fringes of the future now exist. Included are
Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and George Lucas.  All three have now broken
away from the studio system to form their own companies. Cameron pioneered the
system of computer morphing, first in The Abyss then later in Terminator 2. It
was, however, pushed even further by Spielberg's Jurassic Park.
George Lucas is also at the vanguard, ironic for a man who has not directed a
movie in the 20 years since Star Wars. Production of Star Wars IV is expected
to begin in 1997. The reason for the delay was his decision to wait until the
computer effects could conceive his extraordinary vision. Such a time now sits
on a keyboard at his fingertips.
The new generation of action movies are set to achieve the effects of Jaws. In
1977, Steven Spielberg showed us what we had never seen before - the terror
caused by a giant shark. Sure, today it looks clockwork, but racing across the
expanse of the cinema screen it appeared lethal. In 1993 Spielberg showed us
dinosaurs as man had never seen them. More is set to come.
A slate of big-budget action movies based on the exploits of America's
biggest-selling comic characters are planned. James Cameron and his company
Digital Domain are working towards bringing Spiderman to the screen.
The very nature of the new computer effects is suitable for bringing comic
books to life. Richard Donner, director of Lethal Weapon, has plans to make a
movie based on The X-Men.
But while blockbuster movies will be adapted in the future to fit in with
movable seats, the majority of people will still prefer to sit in silence with
their eyes superglued to the big(ger) screen. But then, whose eyes will they
stare into?
Alicia Silverstone, the star of Clueless, has been granted a multi-picture deal
and a $10m pay packet which indicates Hollywood has faith in its dithery young
star.
It remains to be seen if she will go the way of Molly ``who the hell is she?''
Ringwald who graced the cover of Time magazine before diving into the fog of TV
movies. Leonardo Di Caprio has already demonstrated his acting credentials and
will win Oscar after Oscar, after Oscar - unless he does a River Phoenix.
In Britain the brightest young lights include Scots actor Robert Carlyle who
continues to illuminate everything he does. The release next year of
Trainspotting can only push him, and those behind the scenes, further. It would
be fantastic if writer John Hodge, producer Andrew McDonald, and director Danny
Boyle could add Oscars to a mantlepiece weighted with Baftas.
The shortest movie genre in history may well be the techno-thriller such as The
Net as more people transfer over to more sophisticated machinery. An evening at
the movies watching somebody struggle through the same process is like night
school.
Yet the movie genre which will ride ever onwards towards the sunset will be the
Western. Though critics have been ringing its death-knell since Clint Eastwood
first forgot his character's name, quality movies continue to mosey into town.
And it's because men still run Hollywood and men love Westerns. But the women
are working their way up too.
Alicia Silverstone this year joined Demi Moore, Jodie Foster, and Sharon Stone
at the Power Shower. Hollywood's female elite have recently begun using baby
and bridal showers to network. This year the number of female-driven dramas
increased. The number of female directors, executives, and writers in Hollywood
may still be negligible but it is now on the rise.
So, change hangs in the air like the dust clouds stirred up by Omar Sharif's
Ali more than 30 years ago. Change is said to be the only constant. But there
is another where the cinema is concerned. Regardless of new technological
experiences, dynamic new film stock, rising young stars, and fast-paced movies,
people will still remain in the dark.
The cinema is a communal experience - but with some chomping audiences you
might wish they were gagged - and that will never change. Regardless of
innovations to tempt cinemagoers to stay home alone with only cable, satellite,
and sound-systems for company, the big screen lure will win out.
As Douglas Turnball says: ``The traditional film theatre is an important social
phenomenon. I don't expect it to go away. It's an important component of our
culture. I expect it to be augmented by alternative forms of entertainment.''
Yes, but will any of them be as good as a bright screen light in the dark?

a look at developments in entertainments as movie
executives vie to build ever bigger thrills

Rainy camping trips and working for the strangest badges imaginable are a thing
of the past. The approach of the Scouts and Guides has changed, discovers Ann
Donald, even if the principles behind the movements have stayed the same
THE Scout master was well prepared to answer any criticism of his organisation.
``People are still under the misconception that we wear funny hats, long khaki
shorts and march up and down in draughty church halls reciting `dib dib dob
dob'.''
Mike Walker is Convener and Assistant Area Commissioner for The Gang Show. For
those who seek to criticise what is, outside religious organisations, the
world's largest organisation - a new member joins every five seconds - The Gang
Show, like other aspects of this near century-old movement, is an easy target.
Certainly in recent months there has been no shortage of anti-Brown Owl or
Bob-a-Job jibes.
Back in July there were murmurings that Scouts may cease swearing allegiance to
the Crown. A few months later the unwelcome glare of publicity honed in on
Scout leader Peter Atkins who was convicted of molesting teenage boys on camp.
And only last week a Channel Four documentary alleged that founder Baden-Powell
was a sadist, repressed homosexual and fascist sympathiser. Is it any surprise
then that numbers, currently at 650,000 and 750,000 for Scouts and Guides
respectively, have been falling off since the late 80s and both associations
are struggling to recruit volunteers?
Look no further than these negative facts and figures and of course it's easy
to understand the premature media-led demise of a movement that is seen to
personify the anachronistic elements of God, duty to one's country, discipline,
order and all the old-fashioned fun of a sausage sizzle. Why on earth would the
Nintendo  generation want to align themselves with these old duffers straight
out of a golly gosh Enid Blyton book?
Well maybe it's time to wake up and smell the campfire coffee because all these
years we've been sniggering at the woggles, knots and ging-gang-goolies, the
Guiding and Scouting movements have been quietly evolving and trying to adapt
to the needs of the Nintendo generation.
Certainly if the fresh-faced troop of Guides and Scouts I encountered at the
Edinburgh Gang Show are to be believed, then the movement has made a serious
dent in the stuffy middle-class image of previous decades.
Backstage at The King's Theatre, among the clutter of the orchestra's changing
room and in between the bursts of show songs and excited screams and yelps
emanating from the make-up room, a steady stream of teenagers confound my
cynical preconceptions regarding the relevancy of such uniformed youth
movements.
``If someone called the Guides naff I'd say you don't know what you're talking
about,'' says Laura from the 191st Corstorphine. Her friend Christine, fresh
from the world jamboree in Holland, joins in. ``It really is what you make of
it,'' she says. ``Now we sit down with our leader every month and tell her what
we'd like to do to get more out of it.'' And she proceeds to rattle off an
impressive A to Z of decidedly un-naff sports, outdoor activities,
international trips, community projects and badges relevant to computing,
conservation and the community.
``I used to get hassle and get called a `saddo','' confesses one lad before
adding triumphantly, ``then I told them all the things we do and they wanted to
join up too!'' Another Guide chips in enthusiastically about the difference the
1991 Jeff Banks-designed uniform has made. ``You're not embarrassed to wear it
now,'' she says. ``Because you can choose from a denim shirt, trackie bottoms,
or blue culottes, a sweatshirt and a sash to sew your badges on.''
For Gang Show co-ordinator Mike Walker it's a case of facing up to reality.
``The movements have to adapt to the times because if we don't give the kids
what they want then they'll walk away,'' he notes matter-of-factly.
This is confirmed by Elma Tait, County Commissioner for Edinburgh who has been
involved with the movement since joining the Brownies almost 40 years ago. Like
the majority of female leaders I observed in the Gang Show audience, she
appears to have less in common with the bygone breed of buxom, hale and hearty
Brown Owls and more in common with groovy youth club leader.
Listing the pivotal changes over the last decade she says: ``The new uniform
helped and there are far more outdoor activities now. The girls have more input
in the programme and there's more opportunity for international travel. We
really are trying very hard to get this image over to the general public,'' she
stresses.
``They still harbour an image of us circa 1966. Many people don't know that
since 1991 girls could join the Scouts and that the Beavers and Rainbows were
set up for the five-year-olds almost 10 years ago.'' Mention the topic of class
and Tait sighs. ``It's a very unfortunate misconception. You name any area in
Edinburgh and I'll show you guiding going on. We don't have class structure and
that's why we have the same uniform. There are no designer labels.'' Echoing a
fundamental BP belief she adds: ``We're all equal here.''
However much the movements doth protest their evolution and nineties image
change, there is no denying the fact that membership is falling steadily with
the majority dropping out post Brownies and Cubs age group. Out at the Scouts
Scottish HQ at Fordell Firs near Dunfermline, chief executive David Shelmerdine
attributes this bleed to the dropping birth rate and the fact that an
increasing number of recreational youth groups are having to share the same
children. He also cites the role of the parent.
``You have to understand who decides you become a member. For the under-10s
it's usually the parent, over that age and it's the child who decides what they
do with their spare time. It's true of all youth organisations,'' he reasons.
``Once they become independent they go off and do their own thing.''
Another problem the associations face is the public perception of a movement
geared to producing thousands of good little Christians. Not so, says
Shelmerdine, before going on to espouse a philosophy that sounds as if it's
been lifted straight from a new age bible.
``We are and always have been a multi-faith movement. We don't have a strong
religious but rather a spiritual dimension to our work which is summed up by
the acronym SONG. S is for Self relationship. Do I feel good about the way I
live my life? O equals Others. How do I develop my relationship with others; my
peers, community and those less fortunate than myself. N is for Nature. How I
live and my relationship with the world around me. And G is God in terms of
searching for a relationship with a higher being. We never say that to be a
Scout you have to be a true believer. When you make that promise `to do my duty
to God' it means you are promising to explore that relationship with a higher
being. It's all part of your own development.''
It is this framework and value system that differentiates Scouting and Guiding
from all other youth movements, with a continually reassessed programme that
cherishes the somewhat grandiose aim of ``promoting the development of young
people in achieving their full physical and spiritual potential as individuals,
as responsible citizens, and as members of their local, national and
international communities.''
For some this aim is to be commended as the panacea for a secular society's
ills, for others it is an impossible task in an era defined by video games,
child abuse, Lottery greed, street fashion, and every other facet of modern
living. For those involved with the movement though there is no doubt about the
enduring relevancy of this aim and indeed the movements themselves. ``We've
been around for nearly a century now,'' notes Elma Tait. ``And I'm sure we'll
still be here in another hundred years. You can't get rid of us that easily,''
she adds with a defiant smile.

Every household takes for granted the common jam jar. However, during the early
years of the century it was more than just a way to store preserves. It was a
form of currency.
In those days, the jam (jeelie) jar was a prized possession among youngsters.
They were exchanged for money or sweets at the local grocer's, would pay for
fairground rides, and according to many mature members of today's society, the
jars would pay for the price of a cinema admission ticket.
The connection between jeelie jars and the cinema is the only part of that
legend that is hotly disputed, even till this day. For every former patron who
said that it did not happen, there were those regular customers who have strong
recollections of paying their way in with jam-jars and in some cases lemonade
bottles.
Many film historians are convinced that this story was a myth because according
to them, such a practice would have been illegal. At that time cinemas had to
give a percentage of the money raised from admission tickets to the Custom and
Excise, to pay what was an entertainment tax, which ran from the time of the
First World War until the early fifties. So they believed that paying in by the
jam jar method deprived the taxman of his cut.
Another point that was raised was that during the twenties and thirties, a
typical cashier's desk was so small, that there would be nowhere to store the
empty jars.
However, Dunfermline sports coach and film fan, Mike Kenny, believes in the
jam- jar story and was able to explain how cinemas used to get round that
problem based on regular conversations with his parents.
``They used to say that there were two queues, one leading to the cash desk and
one for those with jam jars, which was often referred to as the poor queue,''
he said. ``They handed the jar to the man who would then place it into a box,
and then hand them a ticket. They would then take it to the cash desk where
they would be given an admission ticket.''
One former customer, Ray Hannah, used to go to the local cinema in Blackburn in
the forties and remembers often getting himself into trouble when collecting
his jars to take to the cinema. ``I got many a whack with the banister brush
after being caught supping the jam in the garden shed to get the empties,'' he
said.
No-one really knew how this idea first started. Between the wars money and
resources were scarce. It was common practice for tradesmen to provide
incentives for customers to return items such as glass jars and bottles. Also
in those days when travelling showmen toured the country, a jar could get you a
ride on a roundabout, two rides if the jar was clean. The owners of the ride
would then cash in the jars at a factory or at a shop at a later date.
For many of the small movie theatres they relied on children as a major source
of their income and would do anything to encourage them to come into their
venue. It was not an uncommon thing for cinema staff on a Saturday morning to
stand out- side and entice youngsters with sticks of rhubarb rock.
Not surprisingly, attending the cinema on a regular basis would put pressure on
a family household budget, so there emerged the idea that children were able to
take a jam jar as a method of payment to get into the cinema. According to some
former patrons, as soon as the film finished, if they could not get a jar from
their mother they would often raid the bins at the back of the baker's where
they would usually find large jars stashed among the rubbish.
Even though noted film historian, Frank Manders, has not discovered any
documentary evidence, he is convinced that such a practice did exist.
``There are certainly many cinemas that did not allow jam jars, but there is
plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that it happened at the small picture
houses,'' he said.

OUR boy done good this year. Jonathan Edwards, Britain's world-beating, triple
jump champion, with a leap of historic proportions, went straight into the
record books. And he wasn't being chased either, I thought, as I looked at
``Randolph Leap'' near Relugas on the river Findhorn.
Randolph, it is alleged, was fleeing from a posse of his peers who were intent
upon his murder, which added greatly to the spring in his step.
It is remarkable what the prospect of an imminent interview with St Peter can
do for a man's confidence. We find within ourselves previously unknown reserves
of strength. As happened to the government soldier fleeing after a debacle of
the Battle of Killiecrankie, hurling himself over the river Garry; and
Macgregor, leaping to safety across the river Lyon in Perthshire.
The river Findhorn in Morayshire is one of Scotland's most dramatic and
attractive streams, from its source in the grey Monadhliath mountains, to the
cold waters of the Moray Firth by Culbin Forest near Kinloss. The most
spectacular aspect of the river is a 20-mile long, deep gorge, which begins at
Dulsie Bridge, on the line of the old military road between Lochindorb and
Cawdor, and then continues downstream to the famous Sluie salmon pool, east of
the town of Forres.
The lower levels are known as the ``Meads of St John'', after the Victorian
writer and naturalist, Charles St John. St John, who was born in 1809 at
Chailey, Sussex, lived most of his short life in Moray. In 1834, whilst
visiting Rosehall in Easter Ross, St John met and married Miss Ann Gibson, the
daughter of a rich Newcastle banker.
St John's most famous book, Wild Sports of the Highlands, is often referred to
as 101 Ways to Shoot an Osprey. Nothing furred, finned or feathered which ever
flew, swam or stalked the moors and rivers of Moravia, were safe from his
administrations. St John's stories first appeared in the Edinburgh Quarterly
Review, edited by John Lochart, the son-in-law of Sir Walter Scott, who was
himself a keen sportsman.
There is a variety of pleasant, undemanding, walks along the banks of the
Findhorn Gorge, the sides of which are 200ft high in places. The scenery is
spectacular: woodlands of larch, pine, birch, oak and beech; heather tussocks,
juniper, forget-me-not, primrose, wood sorrel, wood vetch and violet; wren,
thrush, blackbird, blue tit, great tit, tree creeper, chaffinch, and
best-bib-and-tuckered dipper.
n One of the most easily accessible Findhorn walks starts at Sluie (OS Map 27,
Nairn, Gd Ref 27/013524), four miles south of Forres along the A940 Grantown to
Forres road. A roadside sign, on the left, is marked ``Sluie Walk.'' Turn right
here, and drive past Sluie Lodge to reach a car park and picnic area. Walk back
to the lodge and follow the track downhill. Take the right-hand fork at the
first junction.
Within a few minutes, at the Mains of Sluie, you reach a long row of five
deserted cottages. The path along the edge of the gorge gives magnificent views
of the rushing river below. The track is well-marked but great care is required
on this section. After a mile there is a notice warning you to go no further.
Follow the track left, back through the wood to the car park.
``Randolph's Leap'' is three miles south from Sluie. Turn right at Logie
(27/010504) and park on the B9007 at Gd Ref 27/001497.

IT WAS my first encounter with a parrotfish. Aptly named, they are, with their
iridescent blue mouths and ridge of mini teeth, razor sharp for nibbling at the
coral reef. It was dead. Definitely an ex-parrotfish.
Craig, our guide from the Biological Station in Bermuda, hauled it from the
water's edge and radioed for help. It was not an urgent ``bring your
resuscitation gear'' demand. Merely a request to bring a bodybag (fish
wrapper?), perform an autopsy, and find out why it died.
The parrotfish is one of the protected species which lives on the reef, and if
anything is damaging the ecosystem then the Biological Station staff want to
know about it. In these Greenpeace times many independent organisations monitor
the health of the planet. Bermuda's official Biological Station is one of only
two such government-funded establishments in the world, the other being in
Hawaii monitoring the Pacific.
Bermuda. Laid back. No, relaxed would be a better description. A mixture of
sunshine-induced lethargy and colonial correctness. Heady stuff, as heady as
the rum-based ``dark and stormy'' cocktails designed for the unwary tourist. A
genuine tourist trap, so to speak, but not altogether an unpleasant experience.
The colonial presence is still strong, despite the fact that the Royal Navy
officially left its magnificent dockyard almost 50 years ago. Premier John Swan
made independence a referendum issue last summer, but got a resounding ``No''
for his troubles. The tax haven status of Bermuda had more to do with the
result, I suspect, than the Bermudians would care to admit.
They pay no income tax. Local services are financed to a great extent by
tourism (tourist tax, airport tax, hotel tax). The British Treasury looks after
major expenditure, but independence would cut the apron strings.
The locals would then have to pay to support embassies and consulates around
the world, pay to establish their UN voice if desired, pay to promote their
Olympic ambitions, even. The thought of all this taxation must have frightened
off a lot of people who are doing very nicely, thank you, the way things are.
Money makes the world go round.
Some others bore a grudge against Swan. He enlisted the help of Scotland Yard,
in the form of a couple of boys from the Met, to take over the running of the
colony's police force when they were faced with a particularly difficult murder
a few years back. They stepped in over well-respected ``15-year'' men, so the
story goes. In a small community that doesn't go down too well. Neither does a
referendum that wasn't in the manifesto.
Not quite British.
The dress code is British, however, with a naval-colonial input. Cut-off suits
(shorts to you) are a common sight in town. A bit odd at first, when you see
some upright-looking chap emerging from a bank clutching a briefcase but minus
his trousers.
On the double-take you realise that he's wearing a short-trousered pinstripe
suit. When you see similar grown-ups-in-shorts in the discos, you realise that
this is like nowhere else on the planet.
On arrival, visitors must show their return ticket and their hotel booking or
they don't get through immigration. Simple as that. No open-ended holidays, no
beach bums. You could, though, come for a fortnight, fall in love with the
place, and buy a house. The only problem is that it'll set you back at least
#1m.
The island government has a simple policy on house purchase. It may be a tax
haven, but no incomer is allowed to buy a property under a certain value. This
protects the housing stock at the lower end of the market, and ensures that the
Bermudians themselves always have affordable housing.
The gap between what Bermudians pay for a humble dwelling and what the incomers
fork out is considerable. One entertainer's hideaway was for sale when I was
there in early summer. Do you have a spare #12m?
But back to the ex-parrotfish, or rather, the reef. Bermuda is a collection of
islands sitting on a volcanic plateau which is in many places just 25-30 feet
below the surface of the Atlantic. The outer limit of the plateau forms a
treacherous reef on which countless ships have perished. Beyond it is the full
depth of the Atlantic, but within is a haven from the worst excesses of its
storms. Early sailors risked everything, on their journey from the old world in
search of the new, for a safe anchorage. The reef itself is one of the islands'
main attractions. Glass-bottomed boats let you view the magnificent corals and
exotic marine life. A two-hour trip from Hamilton, the capital, to the wreck of
HMS Vixen will set you back about #20 or #30. It was scuttled 99 years ago to
block a channel during troubled colonial times, and the turquoise waters have
long since claimed it and covered it in coral.
Fishing near the wreck is strictly prohibited. The fish are so used to the
tourist boats that the water positively boils when food scraps are thrown
overboard. The nearest thing to tame fish I've seen, outside of a fish supper.
Some of the boats will take you seven miles to the outer reef, a day trip where
you can scuba dive. It costs about $85 for a four-hour lesson over a shallow
wreck, but experienced divers can save considerably on that. Snorkelling is
very much cheaper.
There's also a 48-seat submarine, the Enterprise, which dives 60ft down the
reef, the ultimate experience if you want to see fish and stay dry. You reach
the submarine via a tender from the Royal Naval Dockyard. It may be called the
Enterprise, but the real Captain Kirk runs a rival operation.
The dockyard itself should be at the top of any visitor's agenda. The sprawling
site has been turned into an attraction in the true meaning of the word.
It charts the ascent of western man, from the discovery of the New World,
through the ensuing colonial struggles and the strategic importance of a
western Atlantic base in the Second World War, to its use as a tracking station
down range of the Cape Canaveral Nasa launch site.
It also, by default, charts the decline of the British Empire. This was, after
all, of major strategic importance to what was once the world's greatest naval
power. Viewed from the stern of the ferry as we departed, it was quite majestic
in its redundancy.
The magnificent buildings, apart from the museum, house a cool shopping mall
(coolness being a welcome respite from the summer sun's scorching heat)
complete with bars, restaurants and discos.
The best beaches are along the south coast, some merely rocky coves, others
long and curving and palm fringed. My hotel was on the other side of the
island, but since it is only about 1!s miles at its widest point, that wasn't
too much hassle. In fact it prompted me into trying out one of the best way of
seeing Bermuda.
I hired a motorbike. More of a moped without the pedals, actually. To be
recommended, but remember to wear your helmet. The police are pretty slick at
the on-the-spot fine routine.
There are also deep-sea fishing trips. This politically correct paradise has
taken steps to maintain its placing on the conservationist's list of desirable
holiday resorts.
Ernest Hemingway could never have had it so good. Go deep-sea rod fishing,
catch a marlin, have it weighed, and go home with the aching muscles - but with
the satisfaction that your worthy opponent will live to fight another day.
Returning the catch is the name of the game, but that policy didn't quite
square with the dolphin on the menu in a couple of the restaurants I visited. A
bit of double checking confirmed it was dolphinfish. No need for Greenpeace to
worry. The food is good, especially if you like fish. The fish chowder, a very
thick and spicy broth, is positively addictive. Ever tried a fish steak
sandwich? A wahoo steak washed down with a glass of the local beer or even a
dark and stormy, makes a very satisfying lunch.
One of the best ways to appreciate the island's beauty is to take a stroll
along part of the old Bermuda railway. Like many sections of post-Beeching
track in Britain, the rails have long gone and all that remains is a very
easily negotiated footpath (motor-bikes prohibited).
The railway was built between 1922 and 1931. The entire route covered a mere 21
miles and being Bermuda required 33 bridges, 16 of them over water. The rate of
construction, at 2!s miles per year, made it the slowest on record and the most
costly. It operated for only 17 years before being sold in its entirety to the
then British Guyana.
Its legacy is the the most breathtaking of holiday walking routes.
I covered a several short sections (no more than a couple of miles at a time)
and found that the east end section the most spectacular in a wild and rugged
sort of way.
Craig, our guide, led our small group along with a lively commentary. We left
the Biological Station, itself worth a visit, and walked along the road a few
hundred yards to the start of the path.
The railway path passes one of the old cedar forests, reduced by disease many
years ago to a collection of withered stumps (one of the reasons why Bermuda
cedar souvenirs are so expensive). The calabash tree has replaced it to a great
extent, its gourds making ideal nests for the bluebirds.
Further along you pass an old cemetery where lie some 100 or so victims of the
yellow fever epidemic that ravaged this paradise 150 years ago. The view along
the coastline is spectacular in a rugged sort of way, and as you rest for a few
minutes you can watch the longtails swoop low over the ocean in search of a
morsel. Whalebone Bay, where we found the parrotfish, is the ideal spot for
some snorkelling. A couple of yachts bobbing at anchor complete the tranquil
scene.
Apart from water sports, Bermuda's other major sporting attraction is golf.
Bermuda must boast the world's most spectacular course where you can tee off
towards a pin on the other side of the Atlantic. OK, it's only an inlet but
it's still the Atlantic.
And rugby. There's the annual classic which attracts the most famous names in
the game. Old sportsmen never die. They sip rum cocktails in Bermuda.
If you're not feeling up to a round of golf, a trip to St George is worth the
effort. Take a bus, even. They run every 15 minutes; the drivers could give
some of ours a lesson in manners. St George is exceptionally pretty, with its
marina and replica of the Deliverance, the ship that was built by survivors of
the shipwrecked company of the Sea Venture in 1609 to carry them on to
Virginia. Many ships were lost on the reefs in those days, none more famous
than the Sea Venture.
The replica, plus a ducking stool, stocks, and whipping post for snap-happy
visitors to pose at, make St George a bit of a tourist trap. Enjoyable,
nevertheless, if you take the time to stroll along the side streets.
The capital, Hamilton, has an impressive frontage. It's called Front Street and
is on the waterfront. The cruise ships tie up here, at the pavement's edge
almost, right across the road from the gaily painted shops and restaurants with
their high balconies. The bigger ships, like the QE2, anchor in the Great Sound.
Bermuda has the usual mix of hotels, half a dozen or so five-star international
types and many smaller ones. Officially, nothing should be built higher than
the cathedral in Hamilton, but some of the five-star jobs appear to flaunt the
convention. The smaller ones expand in a lateral fashion. That is, they have a
central building with dining rooms, bars, and a few bedrooms. Then they build
blocks of bedrooms a few feet away. All very tasteful, of course.
A grander version of this is the ``cottage colony'' hotel, which are best
described as exclusive intimate properties with prices to match. One in
particular, the Lantana, boasts what the owner describes as an open air museum
where the grounds are dotted with statues by local and international sculptors,
and the main building is festooned with paintings and artefacts from around the
globe. The prices vary accordingly, as you might imagine. There are also guest
houses and self-catering apartments.
Finally, if you want a souvenir to take home, then remember that almost
everything has to be imported. It does fly the British flag (even if the
currency is the Bermuda Dollar and is pegged 1:1 with the US dollar) and even
has a Marks &amp; Spencer.
To tell the truth, the souvenirs ain't up to much. Cheap T-shirts, very
expensive Bermuda cedar, and booze. In reverse order, the rum is tasteful, the
cedar is tastefully carved, and the T-shirts are as tasteless as anywhere else.
The Americans love the place and despite their influence, or perhaps because of
it, the shops flaunt their Britishness and even their Scottishness. There's the
Pringle shop and an Archie Brown with its giant tartan-clad teddy bear outside
to usher in the customers.
I couldn't say farewell to Bermuda without mentioning its very own Mr Happy.
Johnnie Barnes used to work in the local bus garage, and at lunchtime he would
pass the hour eating his sandwich on the wall outside waving cheerfully to
passers-by.
He's now retired, and you'll pass him on the main roundabout east of Hamilton
where he spends eight hours a day, five days a week, waving to passers-by, and
preaching to them if they stop long enough to strike up a conversation. He's
now such a fixture that he features on the postcards.
My taxi driver gave me Johnnie's history. ``Some people reckon he's lost his
marbles,'' he said. ``I just think he knows something that the rest of us have
forgotten.''

for natural beauty as well as the tax-shy

Mr IVES' CHRISTMAS
Oscar Hijuelos
Bloomsbury, #15.99
EDWARD Ives had no beginning. He was left on the steps of a New York church and
raised in a foundling home - ``as cavernous and haunted as a cathedral''.
Contemplating Baby Jesus made him sad. Jesus was perhaps the most wanted child
in the world, while he had been abandoned.
But his faith sustained him. As a young man he almost wept when he entered a
church at Christmas. He was uncertain of many things, but the fact that he
could contemplate timeless images that seemed to speak especially to him was a
source of inspiration and pleasure.
It had nothing to do with decoration, the cheery wreaths, the bows of pine
branches, the ivy and flowers, but rather about the Christ child, ``whose
meaning evoked for him a feeling for `the beginning of things,' a feeling that
time and all its sufferings had fallen away''.
Ives was a successful commercial artist, who received a note of encouragement
from Walt Disney when he was 13, and made enough money to own, among other
things, a Drer etching. He met his wife in a life drawing class. Annie was a
vivacious woman who could barely stand her family's meddling ways.
She was pregnant when she married Ives. They had two children, Robert and
Caroline, who were raised in an open, fair-minded way. Ives taught his son
about religion and its imagery, how tongues of fire and soaring doves
represented the human spirit and of Christ's desolation when he felt forsaken
in the wilderness.
Ives knew nothing of his ancestry but was drawn to the Spanish cultures that
flourished in 1950s New York city. Even when he became his agency's
vice-president, he continued to live in upper Manhattan, where he felt at home,
in a multi-ethnic community. He helped many local Hispanic families find work
and his best friend was an immigrant Cuban barman who became the children's
godfather.
Oscar Hijuelos has constructed his story beautifully, replacing the exuberance
of The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love and The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez
O'Brien with great warmth and tenderness.
His small chapters are layered with meaning, so that the reader is hardly aware
of absorbing the details, rather sharing the meditation on how peace can come
after a shattering crisis; such as that which befalls Ives' family shortly
before Christmas 1967 when his son is killed.
The value of this novel lies in its truthfulness. Ives is desperate to regain
spiritual peace, but can neither forgive nor understand God for pointlessly
turning against him. Neither can he accept what he sees as the haphazard
rejection of his life and belief.
It is a powerful testament on the need for a spiritual dimension in a society
where it is undervalued or seen as a weakness, and an affirmation of the power
of love and forgiveness in the face of human frailty.

n No matter what they say, it's tough being a bird, and tougher if you're a man
bird. The things you have to do to attract a lady bird's attention! Throughout
the animal kingdom, males have come up with inventive ways to catch a gal's
eye. The methods are as varied as the number of species, but generally there's
one common rule - other males are your competition.
But not if you're a ruff, says David Lank, a biologist from Simon Fraser
University in California who's been studying the little wader's mating habits.
Lank found that there are two genetically different types of male ruff, each of
which has its own strategy for courting females. This alone is unique, but just
as astonishing is the fact that these two male types don't compete directly
with each other. Instead, they work together as a team to attract females, much
like two lads on a night out.
The studies show that while this is very strange behaviour because these males
are competitors they both benefit by pulling in more females than they would by
themselves.
Male ruffs display to females on communal dancefloors, or ``leks''. Most of the
males are independents who strut their stuff in their own court which they
defend against others. A small number are ``satellite'' males which hang about
the leks cruising the courts of independents, who actively try to woo them into
staying and sharing in the matings.
``What we have is a kind of singles bar,'' Lank says. ``With both the males and
the females looking for one-night stands,'' explains Lank. ``A female, it
seems, prefers to do one-stop shopping where there are a lot of males
together.'' A bit like the aforementioned clubs.
Apparently both males do equally well in the mating game. This peculiar mating
system is likely driven by the choosiness of the female, who shows a preference
for male cooperation. If she didn't, the males would all compete directly, and
one or the other type would become extinct.
Further studies have not determined whether ruffs decide which gets the ugly
one or whether they have the phrase: ``Don't like yours much''. It's possible
they take the rough with the smoothie.
n BABIES can recognise their mothers' faces by the age of six months, but their
brains perform the task differently depending on whether it's hard or easy. The
work, carried out by a University of Minnesota graduate student has
implications for how facial memory develops.
n EXPERIMENTS that may result in cars powered by hydrogen fuel are under way at
Sandia's Livermore Lab in California. The lab is leading research with other
institutions to improve an engine that would use hydrogen as part of its fuel
supply. The group envisions creating a hydrogen-fuelled engine to drive a
generator, which would then power electric motors to turn the car's wheels.
Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, creates little more than
water and a small amount of oxides of nitrogen when burned correctly in an
engine.
n A PURDUE University researcher has discovered a bed of ancient bones that may
contain the first fossilised evidence that some species were wiped out when a
giant extraterrestrial object hit the Earth 65 million years ago. William J
Zinsmeister, professor of geosciences, discovered the fossils during a trip to
Antarctica early this year. The fossil bed includes various species of fish and
occurs just above the iridium layer, an unique deposition in the rock record
worldwide that is suspected to have been created by a catastrophic event, such
as the impact of a giant asteroid or meteorite.
n AUSTRALIAN doctors have developed a microprocessor syringe for anaesthetics.
The computer-driven drug delivery system for use in operations can precisely
match the level of anaesthetic with the levels of stress suffered by patients
under surgery. The team at Adelaide developed complex mathematical models which
can predict how drugs perform and the computing software controls the syringe,
allowing the surgical team to concentrate on monitoring the patient.

It started with a pianist masking the whirrs and clanks of the old projectors,
but cinema music developed until some houses had
their own orchestras. Allan Laing listens to the soaring strings
MORE years ago than I care to remember, I went to see a movie called One Flew
over the Cuckoo's Nest. And something wonderful happened, right at the end. You
may recall that marvellous final scene. The mighty Chief Broom smashes the
window, picks up McMurphy's lifeless body, and runs off, almost majestically,
towards a sunset over those dark remembered hills.
And all the time there was the achingly beautiful sound of Jack Nitzsche's
haunting score. It was inspirational. Moving. Perfect. That was the first time
I noticed, I mean really noticed, the music in a film. It was as if a new door
had opened in my mind.
It is an indisputable truth that music is a prerequisite for a film. Without it
movies simply wouldn't work. Together they form the perfect marriage between
the visual and the aural images. You need a score to provide a sense of
continuity. It heightens the emotions of a scene.
We are inclined to forget, as we sit there munching popcorn in the dark, that
what we see upon the screen is a two-dimensional art form. It is music which
magically transforms it into 3-D.
A film score is probably at its best when it provides a narrative to those
dramatic moments (and every movie has them) of utter silence on screen.
The scenes where actions, rather than words, tell the story. Two perfect
examples. Janet Leigh in the shower scene
And yet, despite all that, film music is a highly sophisticated art form. At
its best, it can stand alone without its celluloid partner. Good music is good
music; simple. It can be sparse, minimalist; such as Ry Cooder's slide guitar
work in Paris Texas. Or it can be huge and symphonic; like Maurice Jarre's
anthems for Lawrence of Arabia and Dr Zhivago.
And to think it all started 100 years ago with a wee man at a piano, playing
along to silent movies. His job, not to thrill the audience, but to mask the
sound of the primitive film projector. Airs have graced the motion picture
industry from its very inception. Every cinema in every town in America had a
picture-house band. New York's Paramount Playhouse even boasted a symphony
orchestra. Those Hollywood pioneers soon discovered that music could actually
do something for a movie. It could set its tone and its mood.
It could, almost, tell the audience how they should feel about a particular
scene. For instance, would old romantics have been moved to tears by Rhett and
Scarlett if they'd parted in silence and not to the throat-lumping sound of Max
Steiner's famous Gone with the Wind theme. Probably not (though, frankly my
dear, I don't give a damn).
Still, enough melodrama. Back to the wee man at the piano. When the talking
picture - and the ability to mix sound and vision - arrived it is estimated
that some half-a-million musicians in America were thrown out of work as the
industry moved from live accompaniment to a recorded score, specially written
for the film.
In the early days the music was usually borrowed from the shallow end of the
classical pool. Anonymous, formulaic, and pretty boring, frankly. However, as
technology improved in the 1930s, major studios such as Warner Brothers and
MGM, set up their own music departments. This coincided with the arrival in
Hollywood of an army of hugely talented composers and arrangers, refugees who
had fled Europe in the build up to the Second World War. Unlike many of their
American-born contemporaries, they were all classically trained with a
background and a tradition of either symphonic or operatic work.
Among them were the aforementioned Mr Steiner (Now Voyager, Treasure of the
Sierra Madre, and, of course, Gone with the Wind), Franz Waxman (Sunset
Boulevard and Rear Window), Dimitri Tiomkin (High Noon, Dial M For Murder, Rio
Bravo, 55 Days in Peking, The Alamo), Erich Korngold (Anthony Adverse, The
Adventures of Robin Hood), and Miklos Rozsa (Spellbound, Ben Hur, El Cid).
They took their movie music seriously, these chaps. Thanks to their efforts,
the composer's role was accorded greater status. They even got their names
mentioned in the credits. Movie soundtracks began to be issued on gramophone
records.
In the 1950s a second generation of composer appeared, most of them
American-born this time. There was Bernard Herrmann, with his idiosyncratic
scores for movies such as Citizen Kane, Vertigo and, of course, Psycho. The
versatile and prolific Elmer Bernstein who scored The Magnificent Seven and The
Great Escape and, more recently, Ghostbusters, My Left Foot, and The Age of
Innocence.
A little later came composers such as Lalo Schifrin (Bullitt, Dirty Harry, The
Eagle Has Landed) and Jerry Goldsmith (who studied under Rozsa at the
University of Southern California) with scores which included Von Ryan's
Express, The Sand Pebbles, The Blue Max, and Chinatown. Like Bernstein and
Schifrin, he is still working today (Alien, Total Recall, Basic Instinct).
The fifties also saw some movie directors experimenting (very successfully, as
it turned out) with jazz music. The aforementioned Bernstein wrote a memorable
jazz score for Otto Preminger's The Man with the Golden Arm, Duke Ellington
provided the music for the same director's Anatomy of a Murder, and the great
Alex North relied heavily on New Orleans jazz for Elia Kazan's A Streetcar
Named Desire.
But in the late fifties old scores were unsettled by the arrival of
rock'n'roll. All bets were cancelled with movies such as Blackboard Jungle and
Rock Around the Clock which introduced pop music to the big screen. The
public's apparently insatiable demand for rock'n'roll almost killed off the
large-scale orchestral scores.
They went out of fashion as a new breed of Hollywood director turned to turgid,
anodyne, guitar-based movie music (which always seemed to sound as if it was
played by a very bad amateur nightclub combo). It was tacky material for the
most part; second-rate soul music, cheap jazz, and (for those almost compulsory
dream sequences after the hero has his drink spiked by the ubiquitous femme
fatale) weird psychedelia.
This was not a vintage period for film music. To make matters worse, in
addition to poor scores, there was also the dreaded ``theme song'', without
which, it appeared, no self-respecting blockbuster movie would be seen dead.
Consider the songs in films like The Way We Were, Love Story, Shaft, or (much
better) The Graduate, and Midnight Cowboy. It was a marketing ploy, of course.
You get a pop star to make a hit record of your theme and you promote your
movie in the process. And it still happens (Wet Wet Wet with Love Is All Around
from Four Weddings).
It was a case of orchestral maneouvres in the dark during the sixties and
seventies, a time when only a handful of composers continued to persevere with
intelligent movie scores. Indeed, it was arguably left to two of them - John
Barry and Jerry Goldsmith - to re-invent the art form. These guys were astute
enough to recognise that orchestral scores had moved on a pace. So they took
the best elements of popular music and merged them with the big orchestral
scores.
Barry's consistently brilliant music for the Bond films is a perfect example.
However (this is one of those ``not-a-lot-of-people-know-this'' snippets of
information), he didn't write the James Bond theme; that was Monty Norman.
Another thing to remember about John Barry is the fact that, in a former life,
he'd been a pop composer/ arranger. One of his early successes (with the John
Barry Seven) was Hit or Miss, the best forgotten theme to Juke Box Jury.
In the seventies it was a case of Cinema - The Wilderness Years. The movie
industry's arch-enemy, television, was winning the battle for the hearts and
minds of the audience. People weren't going to the pictures. They preferred to
sit at home and watch the tube.
Hollywood was forced to take a long, hard, look at itself. And somewhere along
the line it decided to fight back. What could it offer that television could
not? The answer was bigger and better movies. Directors such as George Lucas
and Stephen Spielberg led the charge with films like the Star Wars trilogy, ET,
Indiana Jones, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
And, with the return of big movies came the return of big scores, another thing
with which cost-conscious, low-budget, television could not hope to compete.
Enter a genius called John Williams, the quintessential film composer.
Consider again those two simple notes from Jaws, delivered in the rhythm of a
heartbeat. Powerful music, designed to ensure that you will never dip your toe
in the sea again. And then Close Encounters. Five notes this time. Williams
wanted to create a musical beacon, something which would conjure up the image
of mankind communicating with an alien. There were, according to
mathematicians, at least 250,000 ways to combine five musical notes. Somehow
the composer found the right combination.
Only one other modern-day film composer can genuinely claim to rival John
Williams. The prolific Italian, Ennio Morricone, is surely one of the most
versatile talents in the business.
With a huge body of work which includes The Battle of Algiers, The Mission,
Once upon a time in the West, The Untouchables, and Cinema Paradiso, he has
written some of the most memorable scores of the past 20 years.
Today, like the industry it serves, film composing is wonderfully vibrant and
alive. A new breed of stars have emerged. Writers and arrangers like Alan
Silvestri, James Horner, Hans Zimmer and, in Britain, Michael Nyman. You can
even count a Scot among them. Patrick Doyle, Lanarkshire-born and a graduate of
the RSAMD, has written the scores for Kenneth Branagh's Henry V, Dead Again and
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, as well as Hollywood movies like Carlito's Way and
the French film, Indochine.
Another promising development is the fact that many highly respected pop
musicians, perhaps realising that they're a little too old to rock and roll,
have turned their talents to film scores. Ry Cooder (Paris Texas, The Long
Riders, Crossroads, The Border), Mark Knopfler (Local Hero, Last Exit to
Brooklyn, Cal), Vangelis (Chariots of Fire, Blade Runner), David Byrne (The
Last Emperor, Married To The Mob), Ryuchi Sakamoto (Sheltering Sky, Merry
Christmas Mr Lawrence), Mike Oldfield (The Killing Fields) and, perhaps the
most successful of all, Randy Newman (The Natural, Ragtime, Parenthood, Avalon,
The Paper). Newman, it is perhaps worth noting, is the nephew of the
distinguished Hollywood film composer, Alfred Newman.
I end this hopelessly nostalgic and shamefully superficial article with a
rather pathetic caveat. Memory being not what it once was, I have almost
certainly omitted to mention numerous talented and influential film composers.
Glaringly obvious absentees are classical composers such as Benjamin Britten,
William Walton, Arthur Bliss, and Ralph Vaughan Williams, all of whom
contributed so much to British movies of the 1940s.
It is also a dead cert that, among this movie trivia, are some dreadful factual
mistakes. For my sins I apologise in advance. It is remiss of me. Movie buffs
will doubtless write in to point out the error of my ways. However, while
they're at it, they might care to answer a question for me. Whatever happened
to Jack Nitszche after One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest?
Finally, I would like to thank Matthew Rooke, director of music at the Scottish
Arts Council (and a closet film-score enthusiast), for allowing me to pick his
brains. It should be pointed out that any mistakes are mine and not his.

n IT was wee Jaikie of the Gorbals Diehards who intro-duced me to the word.
Whaups must have been burned into John Buchan's memory from his wanderings ovet
Tweedsmuir.
That bubbling song, purling to its diminuendo as the bird planes across the
moors and down to a little run on a patch of burnt heather, is as evocative a
spirit of place as any bird's in Scotland.
Yet the French name for curlew, ``courlis'' is more on-omatopoeic and the old
Scots ``whaup'' is what John Buchan preferred. And so do we.
Happily curlews have ex-tended their nesting areas in this country from
moorland to lowland fields and mead-ows, sand dunes and shingle, though they
still prefer their vegetation unimproved by man.
In summer and winter the Orkneys above all are drip-ping with curlews. At this
time of the year the breeding grounds are silent and the birds are scattered
around our coasts, though two thirds of our curlews winter in Ire-land and we
receive a few thousand visitors form fur-ther north.
There is something worth remembering when you hear the clamorous double note of
a winter curlew echoing off the cold rocks.
It will be eight weeks be-fore the first birds are prospecting the warming
in-land valleys. Not long after, the full song will come quiv-ering up from
that winter note like spring flowers. Imagine the warmth.
n Last week's illustration and caption were inadvertently transposed. We
apologise for any confusion.

Alison Kerr ponders the way the great studios moulded their charges into
fantasy images, with even their private lives fodder for voracious publicity
departments
WHAT makes a star a star? From the late 1920s until the late 1950s, the answer
would almost certainly have been: a major Hollywood studio. During this period
studios operated like factories. Management made all the decisions about who
was to work on which projects and management spies kept a close watch on
proceedings. The production line mentality of the moguls meant that everyone
moved from one film to the next as soon as their involvement in the first job
was finished.
Tasks were strictly demarcated: producers produced, directors directed and
writers wrote. Only a handful of mavericks combined roles. Actors and actresses
may have been treated like royalty outside the studio, but inside it they were
workers like everyone else; subject to the same indignities even though they
were being promoted as super human stars by the relentless machinery of the
publicity departments.
The studio which set the standards to which all the rest aspired was MGM. From
1924, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was founded, until his premature death in 1936,
Irving Thalberg - Hollywood's ``Boy Wonder'' - was the dominant force behind
the studio. Blessed with an eye for talent, he spotted the likes of Greta
Garbo, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford and Jean Harlow and steered them all to
stardom. Once they were there, he chose the supporting actors, storylines,
directors and photographers which would best complement his stars to ensure
that nothing could knock them from their pedestals of popularity. That the
personality of the star came across was more important to Thalberg than the
plot of a movie. Top on his list of priorities was Norma Shearer, whom he
married in 1927, and who did indeed become a major, Oscar-winning, star under
his guidance.
Thalberg believed that ``the public makes the stars'', and so he regularly
tested the star potential of minor contractees by observing audience reaction
to them. At least once a week a Pullman carriage called the ``MGM Special''
would hitch itself up to a train heading for a small town outside the Los
Angeles area. On it would be Thalberg and his closest colleagues, plus a
preview copy of their latest movie which they would show to an audience whose
comments were crucial to the future of both the film and the star.
In the space of 12 years, MGM had built up a roster of the brightest stars in
Hollywood. Thalberg's gift for mixing and matching personalities produced many
inspired combinations (like Gable and Charles Laughton in Mutiny on the
Bounty), and his inistence that once you were a star you were always a star
resulted in second chances for many actors and actresses who had become
casualties of the popularity polls. He established MGM in the public
consciousness as the studio of opulence; the dreamiest of all the dream
factories and it remained the leader of the pack throughout the studio era.
The other studios followed MGM's shining example in accumulating and nurturing
future stars - but on a lesser scale. The Warner Brothers product was a less
polished affair: whereas in the 1930s MGM specialised in expensive escapist
costume dramas, Warners' greatest asset was its gritty realism. Its stars -
Humphrey Bogart, Joan Blondell, Errol Flynn among them - were not the urbane
sophisticates of MGM. They were more recognisable as ordinary Americans. Unlike
MGM's paternalistic head honcho, Louis B Mayer, Jack Warner at Warner Brothers
and Harry Cohn at Columbia were more tyrannical characters. Warner conducted
running battles with some of his employees, most famously Bette Davis and James
Cagney who both protested publicly at the volume of work they were given (a
Warners actor could expect to make seven films a year), and at the fact that
they were not allowed any say in what they did.
Mussolini's methods provided the inspiration for the way Harry Cohn ran his
Columbia studio, and intimidation was the philosophy behind his technique when
dealing with all members of staff - star or no star. His bullying nature lost
him at least one big name - Jean Arthur, the beautiful but nervy actress who
co-starred with Gary Cooper in Mr Deeds Goes to Town and Mr Smith Goes to
Washington. Arthur was scared stiff of Cohn, refused to have direct contact
with him and was frequently suspended by the studio. When her contract expired
she was only too glad to be free of a boss who continued business discussions
with employees even when he was otherwise occupied in his private toilet.
In addition to being one of the toughest studio chiefs, Cohn was notorious for
concerning himself directly with the private lives of his stars. As late as the
mid 1950s, when the whole set-up of the studio system was collapsing, Cohn was
dictating who could be seen with whom. Sammy Davis Jr was given no shortage of
incentives to discontinue his relationship with Kim Novak, then a Cohn starlet
being groomed for the bigtime. Cohn felt that going out with a black man - even
a popular entertainer like Davis - would harm Novak's image-in-progress.
Studio interference with the private lives of stars was par for the course.
There was really no such thing as a private life for a star: anything that
could be used by the publicity department would not remain private very long.
David Niven's first experience of MGM's publicity department was recalled in
his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon. Jock Lawrence, the head of publicity,
wanted a run-down of Niven's life. The conversation went as follows:
``Mother?''
``French.''
``Good, we can use that.''
``Father?''
``Killed in the war.''
``Great! What rank?''
``Lieutenant.''
``Jesus, that's terrible, we'd better make him a General.''
Not only did the studios thrive on the publicity generated by their stars; a
whole industry of fan magazines flourished on the gossip. In the 1920s, 26
different weekly film magazines devoured the lurid details of the many scandals
of the decade. With the establishment of the studio system in the early 1930s,
there was closer co-operation between the studio's publicity departments and
the magazine writers - and less scandal.
Anything remotely harmful to the reputation of a star - and therefore of the
studio - would be hushed up at often ridiculous cost. MGM had to cope with the
suicide of studio executive Paul Bern, who was married to Jean Harlow - its
``Blonde Bombshell'' star. A more routine part of the job of unfortunate
publicity men was to sober up stars who were due in front of the cameras, or
the press.
The closer co-operation between the publicity departments and the magazines
also led to more fiction. From the 1930s, studios would plant unmarried stars
in nightclubs and let the film reporters and photographers do the rest. Going
out at night with the escort of the studio's choice was as much a part of a
star's remit as learning lines before filming began. Thus in August 1942,
Modern Screen's big picture spread was ``a date with Betty Grable and George
Raft'': four pages of photos of Betty and George's evening together, from
getting dressed to go out, to their goodnight kiss.
Between them, publicity departments and magazine writers cooked up all kinds of
myths. Greta Garbo's aloof, I vant to be alone, public persona was probably
down to the fact that she was a naturally private person who hated publicity.
The explanation offered by MGM was that she was a ``Woman Without Love''. Fans
lapped it up.
The love problems of the stars were the main area of concern of fan magazines.
One debate that continued throughout the heyday of the fan magazine was whether
a male star would lose fans by getting married. As one writer put it: ``If the
girls who watch him think that he is going home to his wife they will have more
difficulty in thinking of him as their own Prince Charming''. The magazines
didn't just reiterate gossip about the stars and their love lives, they offered
opinions on them. The actress Janet Gaynor (of A Star is Born) was criticised
for marrying Lydell Peck, because she had cheated her fans out of the wedding
they had been expecting - to her screen partner, Charlie Farrell. And the
criticism wasn't a one-off: Farrell's supposedly broken heart and Gaynor's own
alleged restlessness became an ongoing saga in the press.
Regular features of the fan magazines, which were useful publicity stunts for
stars, were fashion spreads encouraging readers to take tips from their
favourite actress. Modern Screen ran spreads on some of the most elegant and
distinctive stars - Carole Lombard and Jean Harlow among them - and in some
cases, like Bette Davis's, offered patterns so that readers could reproduce
their dresses. Beauty advice pages were often filled with tips from top names
like Claudette Colbert and Joan Crawford.
Very often, the studios used the magazines as a ``direct'' means of
communication between stars and their public - especially if the star had
fallen from favour and was seeking to redeem him/herself: in 1931 Jean Harlow
sent a message to her fans which was more or less an apology for the failure of
her marriage (to Hal Rosson). Stars also dispensed advice. Olivia de Havilland
counselled Silver Screen's readers: ``Don't be Afraid of a Broken Heart''. Joan
Crawford revealed ``The Difference Between Friendship and Love'' for Movie
Mirror, while her former husband Douglas Fairbanks Jr outlined the ``Four Rules
of Married Love'' for columnist Dora Albert.
It wasn't all glamour, though. While the studios tried to portray stars as
superhumans, unconcerned with the more mundane aspects of normal life, their
partners in exploitation - the fan magazines - occasionally preferred to
emphasise the fact that stars were ordinary folk at heart. It was, after all,
slightly distasteful to read that both Constance Bennett and Joan Crawford were
paying $15,000 annually on household bills when men were queueing on
breadlines. The magazines' antidote to the extravagance of the matinee idols
was to bring them firmly down to earth with some good old-fashioned common
sense. Miss Crawford told Modern Screen: ``I'd rather know that the seams of my
stockings are straight than wear diamonds''.
But this film fan's most cherished magazine article is one from the Modern
Screen of April 1939 about the culinary preferences of the star of that year's
Mr Smith Goes To Washington - James Stewart. Jimmy, clearly a home-loving boy
(when he wasn't out on the town), shared his two favourite recipes with lucky
readers: chicken pie and American apple pie.
The end of the reign of the fan magazines was bound up with the decline of the
studio system in the late 1950s and early 1960s: without the dream factories it
was impossible to establish a stable of stars which could rival those of the
1930s when a publicity man declared that a film had ``more stars than there are
in heaven''.

The battle to keep the Maid of the Loch afloat is being won, Jimmie Macgregor
is delighted to report
ON Monday December 4, 1995, Pat O'Neil, Dumbarton District Council's affable
provost made the official transfer of ownership of the paddle steamer Maid of
the Loch to Michael Hughen, representative of the Maid of the Loch Trust.
The trust will pass the ship on to the Loch Lomond Steamship Company, a
recently formed Scottish charity. The couthy little ceremony at Balloch pier
ended years of uncertainty and speculation as to the fate of the ship.
In the summer of 1981 I invited a dear old friend to join me for a trip on the
Maid. An elderly lady from the south, Aga was much travelled, but on her first
visit to Scotland.
On our day, sunlight sparkled on the water and an uncharacteristically
cloud-free Ben Lomond was sculpted against a deep blue sky. The great paddles
churned, people drank tea, scoffed buns, and enthused about the scenery in half
a dozen languages.
Having made a radio series on the West Highland Way earlier in the season, I
was able to tell my companion something of the area's history, wildlife and
topography, and to explain some of the names of the scatter of islands. (There
are more than 30.) She was enchanted by the whole experience, and later was
quite horrified when I told her that this was to be the Maid's last season. A
major overhaul was required, and with no funds available, it was thought that
she would never sail again.
At one time Loch Lomond had five steamers in service, carrying mail and freight
as well as passengers. In the early 1950s when the remaining vessels, Princess
May and Prince Edward, had reached the end of their working lives, the Glasgow
shipbuilders A &amp; J Inglis were commissioned to build the Maid of the Loch,
while Rankin and Blackmore of Greenock supplied the engine.
The tradition had always been to bring the loch steamers up the river Leven,
but the Maid, at 191ft and 555 tons had to be transported by rail in sections
and assembled at Balloch. Her ceremonial maiden voyage was on Friday May 22,
1953, and she last sailed at the end of the 1981 season.
The Maid was moored at Balloch pier and her owners Caledonian MacBrayne offered
her for sale. Steamer enthusiasts, concerned that their darling might end as
scrap, were heartened when an Australian leisure group showed interest, but it
soon became clear that the pier and the surrounding group was the attraction as
the site for a hotel. The next potential saviour was a brewery company who had
run the little steamer Countess Fiona. That too came to nothing.
As the upper deck deteriorated, water found its way in, causing further damage
to woodwork and decking below. The dreaded rust attacked exposed metal, and the
even more dreaded vandals began to strip the ship of anything they thought
could be sold. The dirty dogs even took the steam whistle.
It really began to look as though the old girl's days were numbered, but over
the hill came the cavalry in the shape of Dumbarton District Council who, to
their eternal credit, acquired the ship to hold until her fate could be
resolved. A trust was then formed and the council agreed to pass the ship into
their care if they raised #200,000 towards the cost of restoration. That figure
has now been passed, but a sum nearer #2m will be required to put the Maid back
into service. Security alone is costing #30,000 per annum, but enthusiasm and
optimism are unbounded, with a dedicated group already working evenings and
weekends to prepare the vessel for a total refit.
Some time ago Dumbarton District Council, displaying a touching faith in human
nature, made an appeal for the return of stolen artifacts, with a promise of no
questions asked. Astonishingly, much has already been recovered, certain items
from as far away as Newcastle, though the steam whistle is still missing. In a
scene reminiscent of a B movie, the ship's bell changed hands in a darkened car
park.
The twin aims of the restoration are technical and aesthetic; to upgrade the
ship's performance while maintaining her traditional appearance. The huge
boiler system will be replaced by something much smaller but more efficient.
There will be modern ventilation, but two of the great horn shaped ventilators
will still grace the deck. An up-to-date audio visual system is to be installed
and much thought given to catering facilities. Steam vessels are non-polluting
and there will be no discharges of any kind into the loch, everything being
collected in tanks and off-loaded on land.
Andrew Cumming, the marine architect overseeing the project, points out that
thanks to the fact that fresh water is less corrosive than salt, the hull is in
very sound condition, but the decks are to be replaced with steel overlaid with
wood. The area between the upper and lower decks will be enclosed and glazed,
recognising at last that Scottish loch steamers require slightly different
specifications from those plying the Mediterranean.
The Maid will need good piers, and while Luss, Rowardennan and Inversnaid are
sound, Balloch pier requires a great deal of work. Those at Balmaha and Tarbet
present a problem, having been reduced in size, and Ardlui pier has gone.
All in all a very encouraging picture, and with the combined efforts of experts
and volunteers, supported by the Millennium Fund and other help, the Maid of
the Loch will live again. The target for the relaunch is 1998. In the meantime,
can we have our whistle back please?

Jim Hewitson recalls an incident in the capital which shook the Auld Alliance
to its core
MAYBE now that we're approaching the end of the 700th anniversary Auld Alliance
jollifications (some might say palaver) it can be pointed out that just
occasionally the Franco-Scottish old pals act could be far from hunky dory.
Perhaps the most notorious breakdown in the cordiality of ``la Vieille
Alliance'' came about in 1548 when French troops - our sworn allies, remember -
treated Edinburgh like a captured city, running amok among the citizens and
slaying the provost.
A formidable French force had been in Scotland for months defending Edinburgh
and attempting to dislodge a stubborn English garrison which was holed up
behind its defences at Haddington, East Lothian, under its astute leader Sir
John Wilford.
Historians noted a ``certain incompatibility of temper'' between the Scots and
the French despite their mutual loathing of the English. The French were
apparently not over-impressed by either Scotland or the Scots, the scribes
suggesting that the land was a wilderness and the people savages. When they
marched under the same banner there were ``scowling looks of mutual mistrust''.
Having turned back an English assault on the capital, the French - without
formal permission - quartered themselves in Edinburgh. A minor skirmish, when a
French soldier tried to confiscate a rifle from an Edinburgh citizen, lit the
powder keg.
The scuffle attracted a crowd and the French suffered a severe going-over
before breaking out and being chased from the Cross down Niddry Street, two of
their number having been killed. As this was taking place, the provost arrested
two more Frenchmen and was leading them to prison when a group of about 60
French soldiers burst from the lodgings of their commander, M D'Esse, with
drawn swords, slew the provost and several others, and rescued the prisoners.
The death of the provost, James Hamilton, who was also captain of the castle,
and the period of two hours when the French went on the rampage, drew universal
condemnation. When things calmed down there were demands for retribution and
threats that if there was no official action the citizens would do the needful.
This was a chivalrous time, however, and it was agreed that the most
appropriate compensation would be for the French to perform some brave deed of
war which would satisfy the thirst for vengeance. The French were to storm
Haddington as a signal of repentance. Within 24 hours of the affray at the
Cross they marched off into East Lothian under cover of darkness. Details of
this chivalrous contract had been kept secret and they had reached the outworks
of the town before the alarm was raised.
Half-naked and half-asleep, the English garrison stood to the defence of the
town but the outer perimeter was quickly taken. The course of this swift and
violent action was spectacularly altered by a French deserter who had been
spying for the English garrison. He fired two large cannon into the gateway,
which disintegrated and sent lethal wooden slivers in all directions.
Incredibly, it's reported that up to 100 of his fellow countrymen died in this
incident. The French could not be induced to attempt another assault and
returned to Edinburgh, their tails between their legs. Their shame and defeat
was said to have been welcomed by Edinburgh's citizens.

John Davidson, like an American president before him, goes a-hunting, and is
charmed
LET'S explode one of the great myths of anthropology. People absolutely do not
grow to resemble their dogs. Or cats. Or, for that matter, goldfish. In adult
life, however, they do develop uncanny similarities to the Teddy bears of their
formative years.
Believe me, parents' influence on the development of their offspring is
secondary to that of any Teddy. Consider the characteristics of a 40-year-old.
Whether he has turned out soft, rounded and rather loveable - or dark and
rather grizzly . . . it's always the bear who is to blame.
German toy manufacturers have been making bears for children since the 1870's.
But it was an early twentieth century American president who really started the
bear craze. Out hunting one fine day, Theodore Roosevelt spared a small brown
bear and the embrionic American toy industry shifted into overdrive. And
overtime. For the public began to reassess those big, brown monsters as cuddly,
adoreable creatures. And alongside princess-like dolls and toy soldiers, Teddy
(Theodore seemed a little too formal) took up his rightful place in every
nursery.
He hasn't moved out ever since. While Space Invaders come and go, while each
hi-tech wonder passes in and out of favour, no childhood is complete without a
bear. All too soon, children discover that Teddy is their most trustworthy
confidant and reliable companion -their finest role model for later life. Which
must explain why so many adults ask of their spouses, `Darling, why can't you
be more like Teddy?'
Understandably, some grown men and women just won't be parted from their bears.
And many more find every Teddy bear teacup, Teddy bear notebook and Teddy bear
cushion quite irresistably cute. Which is why this Christmas - like just about
every other since Theodore Roosevelt's abortive hunting expedition, Teddies top
the gift lists.

The mood is medieval this year and thank goodness colours are back to red and
green. Leila Aitken puts out a welcome wreath for a whole new wave of inventive
decorations
CHRISTMAS decorations are now big business. Jenners in Edinburgh give over a
whole department to Christmas trimmings as early as mid-September and many
major cities have a Christmas shop open the whole year round.
There is a fashion element in Christmas decorations, too. Two years ago the
Christmas theme was blue and gold; last year saw new baubles in the shape of
antique bronze stars, suns and moons and this year the trend is medieval.
Candles come in rich jewel colours as well as striped and marbled and this year
they are available in much larger sizes. Fat pillar candles now come in dark
colours as well as the traditional ivory and combine well with very realistic
and luscious-looking artificial fruit, including peaches so authentic that I
saw a small child reach from a pushchair, grab one and suck it with gusto.
The Christmas colours this year, thank goodness, are back to the traditional
red, holly green and gold and nothing is more cheering and reminiscent of
Dickens than a sumptuous fireplace garland of fresh greenery. This one is
really two decorations in one - a centre arrangement of candles and fruit with
a garland draped at each side. The centrepiece can be lifted out on Christmas
Day and placed in the middle of the table for Christmas dinner.
The basic framework for the garland is made from half blocks of oasis cut
lengthwise, wrapped in a continuous length of clingfilm and tied on each side
of the blocks like a string of sausages. Or, larger florists may sell you a
ready-made garland frame made by Smithers Oasis from oasis foam.
To decorate a mantelpiece you will also need:
Greenery -- choose a selection from your garden of different leaf shapes and
texture (eg laurel, spruce, holly, golden cupressus, cedar - cedrus atlantica
``Glauca'' is particularly good), yew, lonicera nitida, variegated ivy,
euonymus).
Trims - red and green tartan ribbon; fir cones; florist's stem wire.
For the centrepiece:
You will need a large block of soaked oasis in a flat oblong dish; five candles
in oasis candle-holders; artificial or fresh fruit and walnuts.
n Cut the foliage into short sprigs 5 to 7.5 cm long. Using flat leaves, such
as laurel, as the background, insert the first  foliage at intervals along the
length of the garland.
n Alternate with other leaves and sprigs of foliage and holly, evenly spaced
until all the oasis is hidden. For soft stems you may need to pierce the
clingfilm first with a skewer. Wrap florist's wire around the base of a fir
cone and add these. Add loops of ribbon wire in the same way.
For the mantelpiece:
n Place the oasis and holder in the centre of the mantelpiece. Insert five
candles in secure oasis candle holders. Vary the height of the candles, by
cutting a little from the base of one or two.
n Insert short branches of spruce and sprigs of holly and ivy, keep them low
and well away from the candles.
n Group a selection of fruit at the base of the candles, anchoring some of them
on cocktail sticks or stub wires. Scatter nuts and small fir cones over the
fruit.
n Drape a garland at each side of the centrepiece to hang over the edge of the
mantelpiece. Add loops and trails of tartan ribbon with variegated ivy at each
end.
The welcome wreath on the door is by far the most popular Christmas decoration.
It puzzles me why people buy these; they are expensive and often sparse. It is
quite easy to make one. Buy an oasis wreath ring from a florist, soak the foam
and pack it with garden greenery as above. At the base of the circle add a
point of interest, red silk poinsettia. For a Christmas party or a welcome
arrangement on a side table, lavish use of gold and red will effectively create
the right Christmassy atmosphere. Gold fabric is plentiful and cheap and a
metre will be plenty to drape at the base of a flower display. This is about
the only time of year when artificial glitter does not look out of place with
natural foliage.
For a Christmas party arrangement: You will need a shallow dish, a block of
oasis foam, two tall red candles, oasis candle-holders, gold artificial fern
and gold cane scrolls (many florists have these);
Flowers - red single carnations; red spray carnations.
Foliage - variegated holly; ivy; rosemary; contorted hazel (corylus avellana)
sprayed with gold paint.
Set the dish with the soaked oasis foam on the drape of gold fabric. Insert the
sprays of hazel curling upwards at the back of the foam and the candles in
holders in front. Add holly to form a roughly triangular shape with the sprigs
of rosemary and ivy trailing at the base to the front and sides.
Arrange the large carnations to the centre and the spray carnations to the
sides and base. Add the gold ferns and scrolls.
By far the best decoration for the Christmas tea table is the Christmas cake
and there are some showstoppers in Joanna Farrow's Creative Christmas Cakes,
published by Merehurst at #10.99, which is an absolutely delightful book of
very original ways to decorate a cake. I couldn't wait to make my cake which is
now decorated with an exhausted Father Christmas flat out on a bed with a
spotted quilt, his empty sack, wellies, slippers and half-eaten sandwich behind
him.
There are other novelty cakes in the book, which I was just as tempted to make
- a complete Nativity scene, a pile of Christmas story books and if you wish to
keep to a medieval theme, there are individual jewelled boxed, an original idea
for decorating small cakes for those who don't need a large one. The cakes are
fun to create in either bought or homemade sugar paste and the instructions are
good.

IT is not given to many people to achieve celebrity through monumental
ineptitude. Such, however, was the fate of veteran aviator Douglas
``Wrong-Way'' Corrigan, who became a transatlantic folk hero in 1938 after he
took off from New York supposedly bound for California and ended up in Ireland.
The disorientated flier has died in California at the age of 88.
Corrigan was 31 when US aviation officials refused to grant him an exit permit
for a solo transatlantic flight, saying his rickety plane was unsafe for such a
long trip. When he took off on July 17, 1938, he said he was heading back to
Long Beach, California. But 28 hours later he landed in Dublin.
Corrigan had a novel explanation for being thousands of miles off course - his
compass froze. And he stuck to that story for the rest of his life, though he
often recounted it with a twinkle in his eye. Whatever the truth of the matter,
he became an instant celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic. He was feted in
Ireland and received a ticker-tape parade when he returned to New York. Later
he starred in a Hollywood movie about his exploits entitled The Flying Irishman.
The authorities let him off lightly, suspending his pilot's licence for only
five days. Corrigan served as a transport pilot in the Second World War and
later ran an air freight service.

DARREN Robinson, who died in New York this week aged 28, helped propel rap
music into mainstream of global culture as one third of the Fat Boys. Rap owes
much of its current popularity to its outlaw status: music of the Afro-American
ghetto for the inhabitants of the Afro-American ghetto. It wasn't always that
way, as the Fat Boys' multi-media success in the mid-eighties proved.
Having earned Top 10 hits with rap remakes of the Surfaris' Wipe Out and Chubby
Checker's The Twist, the Fat Boys went on to appear in TV's Miami Vice as well
as a movie, Disorderlies. Nicknamed the Human Beat Box, Robinson propelled all
their music with the percussive grunts, exhalations and clicks he could
generate within his 450lb body.
As their name indicates, the heavyweight trio's forte, whether captured on
vinyl or celluloid, was comic self-parody. Their mission was to spread smiles,
not angry polemic. Rap mutated into self-aggrandisement in the nineties,
forcing the Fat Boys into redundancy.

Sarah, Dowager Countess of Haddington; born November 13, 1903, died December
14, 1995
SARAH, Dowager Countess of Haddington, a driving force behind the first
Edinburgh International Festival, has died after a long illness. She was 92.
Her work in helping to steer the festival, which started in 1947, through its
early years received praise throughout Britain. It was her love of all kinds of
music which led to her involvement in the festival committee which she served
on for 14 years.
Being a classically-trained pianist she loved Chopin but an indication of her
wide-ranging musical taste was that the Rod Stewart song, Sailing, was a
particular favourite of hers.
Away from music and her extensive work with the Edinburgh Festival she managed
to fit in fund-raising work with the Royal British Legion Scotland. She became
president of the women's section in 1939 and was a driving force in its work
for many years.
During the war her country home, Mellerstain near Kelso, became an emergency
military convalescent hospital. Soldiers from Canada, Britain, Poland, and
Australia were welcomed to the house and its grounds. The soldiers never forgot
the kindness they received and many of them, particularly Australian and
Canadian, kept in touch through the years.
One of her biggest and most successful projects after the war was the
fund-raising campaign between 1949 and 1952 for the Scottish National
Institution for the War Blinded at Linburn.
A British Legion Scotland spokesman praised her work and said Lady Haddington
helped raise thousands of pounds for them throughout the years. ``Her efforts
were magnificent,'' said the spokesman. ``At Linburn alone her efforts resulted
in a new house for the blinded being donated and built.''
Lady Haddington was born in Montreal and she met her future husband George, the
12th Earl of Haddington, while he was serving as an ADC to the Governor-General
of Canada. They married in 1923 and settled down at the family home at
Mellerstain.
She was a keen gardener and when the family moved to Tyninghame House near
Haddington in East Lothian her skills came to the fore. She helped restore the
interior of the house and created the world-famous gardens which are open
occasionally to the public through the Scotland's Garden Scheme.
Lady Haddington, a former president of the scheme, also helped set up the East
Lothian Amenity Society which cared for local planting and landscaping.
Her husband George died nine years ago at the age of 91. She is survived by her
son, John, the 13th Earl of Haddington, and her daughter, Lady Mary Russell.
She had eight grandchildren and four great grandchildren.

Thomas Richard Evans, marine engineer; born September 10, 1911, died December
10, 1995
THOMAS Richard Evans, former managing director of Alexander Stephen
Engineering, has died at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, at the age of
84. He was considered a first class manager of the old school.
A Renfrew man by birth, Mr Evans was brought up and educated locally,
continuing his studies at Paisley Technical College. A chartered engineer and a
fellow of the Institute of Marine Engineers, he started his career as a
draughtsman and served his apprenticeship with the Renfrew shipbuilding firm of
Lobnitz. From there he went to work in London with the aircraft manufacturers
Handley Page, until, in the words of his widow Annie, ``the bombs chased us
home''.
Joining Simons of Renfrew, Tom Evans became their chief draughtsman. The two
firms Simons and Lobnitz (neighbours on the riverbank) were traditionally at
daggers drawn and a 1960s merger proved unsuccessful. When the joint company
closed, Mr Evans had the task of finishing a number of orders for dredgers and
then overseeing the closure. ``He really felt bad,'' recalls his widow, and he
tried to find jobs for the displaced workforce.
He subsequently became managing director of Alexander Stephen Engineering - one
of the successor companies created from the original Alexander Stephen and Sons
Ltd when Upper Clyde Shipbuilders came into existence.
``He was a very fine manager in a very onerous job,'' recalled Mr Alexander
Stephen, manager director of the original firm, yesterday, ``and was very able
and forceful and good with his men. He was a first-class manager of the old
school.''
Despite angina, Tom Evans travelled the world, from the west coast of America
to South Africa, seeking orders for the company which, in a period of
recession, was making stabilisers, pressure vessels for power stations, and
variable-pitch propellers for warships, among many other things.
Tom Evans was counselled to retire at the age of 63, having been told his life
expectancy was very short; he would look back 21 years later on this premature
medical advice. Meanwhile his firm closed two years after his retirement. Its
main building, with its cast-iron columns and roof trusses, has now been
re-erected at the Scottish Maritime Museum in Irvine.
Mr Evans was a staunch churchman and a member of Renfrew Trinity's
congregation. His hobbies included stamp collecting and horticulture and he was
a former president of the Orchid Society of Glasgow.
Alexander Stephen paid tribute yesterday to Tom Evans's ``huge personality'',
recalling a man who was ``full of fun and very tough. What he said he meant. It
was a joy to have him as a colleague. He was very forthright and one of the
most loyal people I've ever met.''
Mr Evans leaves his widow and his daughter Anne and family. His funeral takes
place today.

Liz Taylor marvels at Diaghilev's
colourful costumes
CASTLE Howard, the Yorkshire stately home where Brideshead Revisited was
filmed, has figured strongly in the saleroom scene this week.
One of the attractions for visitors to the house used to be a display of
costumes created for Diaghilev's Ballet Russe in the early years of the
twentieth century. That colourful display will, however, no longer be seen at
Castle Howard because the costumes were dispersed by auction before an eager
audience at Sotheby's in London last week.
The magnificent costumes were acquired in the late 1960s and early 70s by the
late George Howard, former chairman of the BBC. He started buying in 1967 when
Sotheby's held an auction of the contents of several hampers filled with
wonderful clothes which had been discovered in a Paris warehouse.
The moving spirit behind the Ballet Russe, which began in Paris in 1909, was a
non-dancing, non-performing Russian, Sergei Diaghilev (1872-1929), who,
however, managed to gather round himself the most original and artistically
talented people of his time. His dancers included such names as Nijinsky,
Massine, Pavlova, and Karsavina; he used the music of Stravinsky, Debussy, and
Ravel commissioned artists like Leon Bakst, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque and
Pablo Picasso to design the costumes.
Diaghilev's productions took the artistic world by storm, transformed popular
taste by setting a fashion for exuberant colours, flowing lines, and gold and
silver threads which made the dancers look as if they were shimmering with
light as they danced under the spotlights.
Some of the most striking pieces were designed by Leon Bakst for the 1912
production of Le Dieu Bleu in which the dancers wore towering head-dresses,
gem-studded skirts, gold silk breeches embroidered with gold and silver
sequins, and haloes of wired gold that flared from their heads like flames.
A costume designed by Natalia Gontcharova in 1916 for Sadko, about a
fantastical sea creature, consisted of a head-dress like a fish's head with
bodice and trousers of flame-like material. Its estimate in the sale was around
#8000.
Matisse was responsible for the costumes in the 1925 production of Stravinsky's
Le Chant de Rossignol. Tinsel discs and flower petals on the costume of one of
the mourners in the ballet were painted directly on to the silk by Matisse
himself. The estimate for that robe was also around #8000. The pink leotard
embroidered with appliqued velvet and silk petals which was worn by Nijinsky in
Le Spectre de la Rose, his most notable role, was in the sale with an estimate
of #800 to #1200.
Castle Howard also figured in a now closed exhibition of Faberge pieces which
has been running at Tessier's, the Bond Street jewellers, but which will reopen
at Castle Howard in the New Year. There are 24 items in the exhibition which is
a testimony to the art of Carl Faberge, jeweller to the Imperial Russian Court
at the turn of the century. Amazingly these treasures lay forgotten since the
1940s, in a storeroom at Castle Howard, and have only recently been
re-discovered.
Some of the pieces are tiny carvings of birds and animals - ibexes carved from
brown agate; a rat, a rabbit, a hoopoe, and owls carved from hardstone; a
rhinoceros carved from obsidian; two cheerful looking elephants carved from
chalcedony and others carved from crystal. There are also little nephrite
pumpkins, a gold-mounted Easter egg, a little silver and blue enamel clock, and
a jade and gold mounted cigar holder and cutter. This exquisite little
exhibition will do something to make up for the loss of the Diaghilev costumes
for future visitors to Castle Howard.

George A MacKenzie, schoolmaster and author; born February 18, 1926, died
December 3, 1995
GEORGE MacKenzie, former deputy rector of Cathkin High School, near Glasgow,
came into that category of Scottish lad-o'-pairts who had to fight his way to
education, against the odds of his generation.
Born in Aberdeen in 1926, he was left without a father at four and depended on
bursaries to get him first to Robert Gordon's College and then to Aberdeen
University, where he graduated with honours in French and German.
But even that suffered the interruption of the Second World War when, before
graduation, he was called up for the war effort, or rather ``called down,'' as
George liked to joke about it - because his service was to be as one of the
much-publicised Bevin Boys who would work in the coal mines.
He was not required to go underground but George volunteered to do so and was
down the pits for two years before resuming his honours course at Aberdeen. He
would later utilise the experience to write about his memories as a Bevin Boy.
His authorship included a book called From Aberdeen to Ottawa, which he based
on the detailed diary of an Aberdeen lawyer who set out in 1845 to find his
relations in Canada.
For his bread and butter, however, George MacKenzie embarked on a teaching
career in his native North-east in 1951, first at Maud Higher Grade School and
then at Ellon Academy.
He took his linguistic skills south to Lanark Grammar - he also served on the
local town council, became a Kirk elder, and was active in the Educational
Institute of Scotland - before becoming principal teacher of French and German
at Bishopbriggs High. In 1970 he moved to Cathkin High where later he became
deputy rector to Sir James Munn, though he was forced into early retirement
when he suffered a stroke 15 years ago.
George MacKenzie nevertheless used those years to spread his breadth of
interests, from travel and writing to music and philately. With his language
skills, he had travelled widely in Europe, both with family and pupils, and was
deeply affected by a visit to the Dachau concentration camp in Germany.
An interest in genealogy took him exploring in the United States and Canada.
With his teaching career largely concentrated on the Glasgow area, Bishopbriggs
became the family home. Again with his languages, he became a prime mover - and
interpreter - in the twinning of Bishopbriggs and the French town of
Corbeil-Essonne.
An undying devotion to his native North-east found expression through the West
of Scotland Gordonians, with whom he attended the recent farewell Glasgow
performance of Scotland The What?
So George MacKenzie didn't waste his time and was busy on his various
activities till he went into hospital for what was thought to be a routine
gall-bladder operation. But complications set in and he did not rally. He is
survived by his wife Jessie and three sons, James, Andrew, and Gordon.

WHY on earth dig when worms will do the job for you? Why mow the grass when,
left well alone, it produces a tapestry of orange hawkweed, yarrow, buttercups
and ox-eye daisies? A path cut through the meadow is enough to give the
impression it is all under control.
That's the Rosemary Wilkes method and it gets straight to the essential problem
of gardening - how to work with nature. ``People are torn by the desire to have
control over their garden, which means keeping it neat and tidy, yet somewhere
inside everybody there is a craving for a little share of the wild.''
As far as Wilkes is concerned there is no real contest. She is happy to give
nature the upper hand which results in a kind of gardening which she says may
not seem like gardening at all. ``When I had an Open Day one woman came up to
me and said: `my husband thinks your garden is really beautiful but it would
drive him crazy, he would have to tidy it up'.''
There is no routine tidy-up in the garden behind Prestonmill Cottage for good
reason. Summer's growth is not cut back in autumn because it provides food and
shelter for wildlife over the winter. Leaf litter is there for ground beetles.
Seed heads, rose hips and berries attract birds during winter. Dried herbaceous
plants and ornamental grasses are home for all kinds of hibernating insects.
The effect in winter is rather like a rough homespun tweed of greys, browns and
greens with sparks of red.
The craft teacher who runs workshops in weaving, spinning and knitting has
developed her own planting style using plants for texture and colour just as
she grows the woad, chamomile and madder which produce natural blue, yellow and
vivid red dyes. But there is more to it than that. This ``little bit of
jungle'' in the middle of East Lothian's vigorously farmed fields is a part of
a particular outlook on life which sees order in the seasons and chaos in the
self-imposed routine of the city.
Ten years ago Rosemary and Peter Wilkes decided they did not want to stay in
the city for the rest of their working lives. The peaceful cottage with a
spinning wheel in the corner seems an idyllic refuge - especially while the
rest of the world is revving up for the Christmas rush. It is never quite that
easy.
The banker follows the East Lothian commuter trail into Edinburgh while the
craft teacher is based at home with opportunity to contemplate the changing
patterns of rural communities. Since their garden backs on to Preston Mill,
owned by the National Trust for Scotland, the surrounding environment is
probably secure but traditional local jobs are disappearing. ``I know I am one
of very few people at home during the day and that has social implications,
particularly for older people.''
A friendly and thoughtful woman Wilkes knows there are no easy solutions. She
believes hobbies such as gardening and weaving express a growing desire for
closer contact with nature and more direct control of our lives. In her own
case, gardening was a discovery. After 16 years in a top flat with a distant
back green she arrived in East Linton with a few pots of woad and ``complete
blind ignorance'' about the challenge lying in wait at the back door. ``We just
didn't know what we were letting ourselves in for.''
They began with a wide expanse of lawn in the shelter of shrubs and beautiful,
mature but overcrowded trees - a blue cedar jostles for headroom with a red oak
which has lime green leaves in spring and turns to flame in autumn. The garden
was created in 1938 by John Burns, a local engineer who developed the cottage
and laid out an extravagant design. The remains of a waterfall and rockery
gradually emerged as the Wilkes cut back grass and sprawling shrubs.
While Peter drew plans for new beds and borders, Rosemary ``read and read and
read''. Christopher Lloyd is her reference for sensible advice, Beth Chatto her
bible for plants in dry gardens. Kellie Castle, just across the Forth in Fife,
shows what thrives on the cold, dry east coast. Her scrapbook of notes and
photographs recorded over the past 10 years shows an undeniably methodical
approach to the apparent informality of the garden. And, of course, there is
control.
Some of those cotoneasters which are already attracting red wings into the
garden are neatly clipped into columns or wrapped close to walls , roses (briar
and rugosa) are set out in a semi-circle providing a ``scented hot spot'' in
summer, an ancient holly has been cut into a comfortable round shape, ``like a
Christmas pudding on legs'', and herbs are bursting out of their brick-lined
borders.
``You need formal and wild elements,'' says Rosemary Wilkes, leading the way to
the woodland corner where curved benches provide a view of birds visiting the
garden. The flycatcher's nesting box had to be removed when the family cat took
to sitting in wait above it but there are ways of accommodating pets and
wildlife.
A delay in cutting one area of the lawn revealed wildflowers which had lain
dormant from the original meadow. Now it is cut with shears in August. The
cuttings are removed immediately to prevent fertilising dominant weeds and
grasses and the ay, ``very nutritious'', is used to mulch the rhododendrons.
``The area can look untidy but we just mow round the edge in June and July so
that it looks under control.''
Nature can be used to our advantage. Digging may be no more than a waste of
energy, ``if you dump organic material on the surface the worms will take it
down for you''. Too much tidying up could be destructive. In many areas of
Scotland, earthworms are threatened by the fearful New Zealand flatworm, which
seems to have no natural (or chemical) enemy. New evidence suggests that ground
beetles eat the disgusting alien but ground beetles need a nice supply of leaf
litter. ``The urge to tidy up could prevent nature from finding its own
solutions. I have found flatworms under pots and stones in one damp corner bu
the soil in other areas is still teeming with earth worms.''
Doing what comes naturally, Wilkes, the craft organiser of the Royal Highland
Show, was horrified to discover she was regarded as a gardening expert when an
appearance on The Beechgrove Garden led to a series of invitations to talk to
groups of amateur gardeners. ``People began to ask me terrible questions, such
as what do you do about black spot on roses and I had to answer - `nothing'. I
don't do anything at all.''

n FOR those with a predeliction for plunging necklines on their party frocks,
the onslaught of Christmas parties means the uplift of the chest. The people to
turn to - your chest in their hands, so to speak - are Gossard, whose tip for
success this Christmas is to invest in one of the bras in the Gossard Ultrabra
Perfection range.
These combine Gossard's celebrated uplift element with day-long comfort.
Perhaps the most practical of the range (and the cheapest) is the strapless
Ultrabra. Unlike most strapless bras, the Gossard version doesn't squash and
flatten the bust. Rather, it creates the same cleavage as its strappy
equivalent would. Available only in black and white, the sizes of Ultrabra
range from 30-38A and B, and 32-38C; and the price is #16.99.
n NOW that you've got your bosom squeezed into your little black dress, the
next problem on the checklist is the hair. The way to wear your hair this
season is  la Julie Christie circa 1965, darling. It should be blow dried
straight, teased back slightly, but with a heavy fringe skimming the tops of
smoky, heavily lined eyes.
All very well, if your locks are thick and stay where they're put. If they
verge on the wispy, baby soft side, then the thing to try is Vidal Sassoon
Salon Smooth Protective Styling Spray (#1.99 for 150ml) which builds body in
fine hair and gives it a healthy sheen. The style can then be set with Vidal
Sassoon Holding Spray (#1.99 for 150ml).
n THE most common contact allergy among women in the industrialised world is
nickel allergy - an allergy to the component metal of most costume jewellery.
Reactions vary from itching through to severe dermatitis, and mean that for
many women, wearing costume jewellery is out of the question. Until recently,
only three costume jewellery brands had been awarded the Sheffield Assay Office
``N'' Mark which guarantees that their products are nickel-free.
Now, a new mail order costume jewellery catalogue has joined them. Jessica
Maybury offers more than 200 nickel-free pieces of jewellery, and the entire
collection is plated - either with 22 carat gold or sterling silver. Classic
styles of chokers, chains and bracelets sit alongside more up-to-the-minute
matte silver and gold pendants and novelty diamante brooches.
Prices range from #1 for a pair of stud earrings to #49 for a silver panther
brooch. There are also items in such unusual, but attractive, combinations as
copper and black diamond. Delivery is guaranteed within seven days, whether
orders were placed by post or by phone.
q For a catalogue contact Jessica Maybury, Maybury House, Hove, East Sussex BN3
6HA. Telephone: 01273 747374.
n IF your hair's too long to be brought under control by a squoosh of holding
spray, you could dress it up with some of the bejewelled hair accessories that
are all the rage this winter. Haircare company Celeste offers a wide selection
of attractive party accessories ranging in price from #1.99 to #3.99. Among the
styles they're promoting this winter are silver and gold beaded side combs
(pictured above), lacy snoods, velvet slides studded with pearls, ribbed satin
scrunchies in jewel colours and diamante clips. To find your local stockist,
call the consumer helpline on 0500 979899.
n BEAUTY expert Liz Earle, pictured, has more qualifications than most folk for
dispensing a little pre-festive season advice on how to reduce the effects on
your skin of little sleep: not only is she the author of more than 30 natural
health and beauty books, but as one of the team of GMTV presenters, she is
contract-bound to rise even before the larks. As a result, she has had to
develop ways of combatting the effects of the night before.
To fully wake yourself up of a morning, 20 quick splashes of ice cold water
over your closed eyelids should help, and will also serve to stimulate the
lymphatic system and reduce puffiness.
Tired, dull, and blotchy skin can be treated with a homemade natural compress
comprising one tablespoon of ground oatmeal, one tablespoon of warm water and
two drops of camomile essential oil.
Once all these ingredients have been mixed together and left to thicken, you
should dip a face cloth into the mixture and gently pat it all over your face
several times, before leaving it there. After 15 minutes, wash your face
thoroughly and pat dry.
Earle also suggests that spots be treated by applying a little tea-tree
essential oil to them. And, possibly most usefully at this time of year: Earle
suggests that if - in your drunken stupor - you can remember to down a couple
of evening primrose oil capsules and a B complex vitamin supplement after
you've been out boozing, you will reduce your suffering the next morning.
n TO its existing range of treatments geared mainly towards women, VIP Beauty
of Jordanhill, Glasgow, has introduced the Dermalogica skincare system, which
has products designed for men and women. A treatment consists of a deep cleanse
which prepares the beard; an exfoliation; which helps to free ingrowing hairs
before they become infected; a shave and application of a facial masque. geared
towards the customer's skin type.
The part which may appeal most to the man in your life, however, is the
10-minute nap while the masque sets. The Dermalogica treatment costs #18.75.
During December, the salon is running a special introductory offer:
two-for-the-price-of-one skincare treatment for couples who make a joint
appointment. Prices for women's treatments start at #12.85 for a pick-me-up
facial, but the special offer would be based on the cost of the more expensive
treatment.

Joel Shulman, born, Glasgow, February 25, 1923, died, Toronto, December 12, 1995
AFTER an extended illness, Joel Shulman, also known professionally as Joe Saye,
died on the evening of December 12 in Toronto where he made his home for the
last 23 years. He had suffered from multiple sclerosis but died of cancer.
Mr Shulman was born in Glasgow in 1923 and as a young boy showed great promise
as a musician; there was no family history of musical talents but Joel's
abilities were such that at age 14, Roy Fox, a leading bandleader of the day,
hired him as a featured accordion player, (1937-38), managing to get Joel
released from school at Greenhead Academy to do so.
He then spent eight years in vaudeville, formed his own trio in 1948, (piano
was now his preferred instrument), and made his BBC debut in 1949. In that same
year he married Joan Warner.
Joel moved to the US in 1955 and in 1958-9, on the recommendation of his friend
George Shearing, worked as accompanist for singer Dakota Staton. At this time
he also performed with his own trio, Joe Saye's Scottish Jazz. Throughout the
sixties his playing took him all over the US. He developed a very personal solo
style on his instrument.
In 1972 the Shulmans moved to Toronto when he quickly become a favourite. Joel
and Joan opened The Garden Party, an intimate little room in the heart of the
city, which they ran for seven years. It was the setting for a series of Sunday
evening musical dialogues with the leading jazz instrumentalists on the Toronto
scene.
The achievements of Mr Shulman are all the more impressive given the fact that
from age two he was blind, caused by the effects of retinoblastoma.
His courage, dedication and sense of humour speak to a remarkable strength of
character which was put to the test many times throughout his life. His wife
Joan described Joel as ``a truly lovely and good man''.
For my own part, I never knew a wittier pianist, both verbally and musically.
It was a joy and a challenge to play with him. A memorial service, to be held
in London is planned for January 7.

Alison Kerr and Anvar Khan look
at two sets of famous features
flogging fragrances this Christmas
IT seems appropriate that the face launching Africa, Britain's newest teen
perfume should be Britain's latest teen supermodel - the unhealthily (even by
superwaif standards) scrawny, but undeniably beautiful, Jodie Kidd, main
picture. Africa - an exotic combination of ylang ylang, jasmine, precious
woods, amber and vanilla - is the ideal choice for younger fragrance fans. Not
least because none of the three items in its range costs more than #9. The 30ml
eau de parfum costs #8.95; the 15ml eau de parfum costs #4.95, and the 100ml
body spray costs #2.45. The collection is exclusively available from Boots
stores.
At the age of thirteen, Paulina Porizkova, the new face of Red by Giorgio
Beverly Hills, left, whose surname sounds like a sausage, had to be smuggled
out of Czechoslovakia by her refugee parents. She was discovered by a scout in
Sweden (I can just see him in his shorts and braces and feathered cap) who sent
her photo to modelling agency Elite. She says, somewhat pretentiously, that
modelling is like ``being an apple in a still life painting''. What she's
trying to say is that she simulates extraneous vegetable matter. And, lord,
she's good at it too.

CHARLES Warrell, the man who wrote the I-Spy children's books and was known as
Big Chief I-Spy, has died at the age of 106.
The books, from the first in 1948, encouraged youngsters to search out the
wonders of their world. Children scored points for spotting objects such as
birds, cars, and oil tankers. The sixpenny books were so popular they were
turned into columns in the Daily Mail and the News Chronicle.
Youngsters who managed to score all the points in a book could join the I-Spy
Club. But for sixpence any ``pale-face'' was welcome to the great Tribe of
Redskins. Further up the I-Spy hierarchy, members could become patrol leaders
or tally book keepers, organising their own meetings. Mass theatre outings were
also arranged for the young. On one occasion 8000 children - travelling in 80
hired double-decker buses - enjoyed an I-Spy day out in London.
Charles Warrell spent his early life as a science teacher before becoming a
headmaster in Nottinghamshire. His idea for children's books was rejected by
several publishers so, at the age of 59, he published the first book himself.
He pulled off a major coup when he persuaded Woolworths to sell it. He never
looked back - 25 million books were sold in 20 years. The whole series lasted
until 1986 and it has since reappeared under different imprints.
Charles Warrell lived in Budleigh Salterton, Devon. He died at the Valley Lodge
Nursing Home in Matlock, Derbyshire.

Willie  Anderson,  managing director of John Smith &amp; Son Bookshops and
president of the Booksellers Association, tells ANN DONALD about his night time
reading.
n I'M a real grasshopper when it comes to reading as I've always got four or
five books on the go at the same time. That's the problem of being a bookseller
- too much choice. Though since I came off the shopfloor in 1984 I tend to read
those books that are thrust into my hands by publishers or those that nobody
else wants.
I do prefer fiction to other genres and of course a lot of that tends to be
American fiction because that's where the quality is.
I still don't think that there are any British authors that compare with the
likes of John Updike or Saul Bellow and their tremendous rhythm and poetry. One
book that I really got into recently was George Mackay Brown's collection of
short stories called Winter Tales. I haven't read much of his work but this was
impossible to put down once I'd started it.
Another one was Bill Bryson's Notes From A Small Island. I think he's a highly
amusing author though his book isn't as funny as previous titles set in small
town America. He's very good fun to read because of his relaxed style of
writing.
The last one that I really had to persevere with was Oscar Huejelos novel, Mr
Ives' Christmas. It could be described as a modern parable of Christmas centred
around a very, very religious gentleman who has lost his only son and is coming
to terms with this loss, his life and thoughts of God.

OUR eldest daughter is a nurse, and has had to spend the occasional Christmas
working, so we should never forget those for whom Christmas Day is not a
holiday.
However, for the majority of us Christmas Day is a holiday. No mother can ever
forget the exhaustion of Christmas morning when children were very young! First
the Christmas Eve evenings, going into the night, spent hovering about on the
landing waiting for various children to drop off to sleep before being able to
deliver the filled stockings to the ends of their beds, followed by too few
hours sleep before pre-dawn awakenings by the children, mouths crammed with
chocolate money, exclaiming over the contents of their stockings!
Christmas Day should be, as far as possible, as much a holiday for host or
hostess as for the rest of the household. Last week I wrote about preparing the
turkey early - next week I shall be giving attention to the numerous ways that
the rest of the food preparation can be finished off in advance.
My aim is to get everything done in the kitchen in advance of Christmas
morning, bar the things that just have to be done for each meal and the table
setting and clearing. For these tasks you should be inundated with offers of
help from family and friends - do not hesitate, accept all offers of help with
alacrity! I do. Adopting a martyred air and turning down offers of help do not
make for a good atmosphere in the house over Christmas!
I have experimented with the content for breakfast for Christmas over the
years. We have had a brunch, of the black pudding, sausage, bacon and egg and
fried bread variety, with Bucks Fizz to drink. We all felt so ill by midday
that we had to force ourselves outside for much-needed exercise. We had rallied
just sufficiently to enjoy Christmas dinner that evening.
Another year, not long ago, I made cranberry muffins for breakfast. I felt
rather pleased with myself but Godfrey is not one to hide his feelings, and he
discovered then that he had a deep dislike for cranberries. So did our four
children. They went in search of bread for toasting.
My desire for breakfast for this special day is for something more special than
toast, and so I evolved my own recipe for a spicy dough with marzipan through
the centre. You need look no further than the Stollen on sale in good
supermarkets to find the source for my inspiration.
My recipe contains no mixed peel - but you can get a citrus taste by adding
grated lemon and orange rinds to the dough. Making your own almond paste is
much nicer than buying a block of marzipan. Every brand of commercial marzipan
I've tried is too sickly. The more you work the almond paste the more the heat
of your hand will release the natural oil from the almonds, making the paste
bind together.
If you add any liquid to speed this process, use more lemon juice. This bread
freezes well. Thaw it overnight at room temperature, and warm the loaf before
slicing thickly to serve.
It is delicious toasted lightly, but you really need to grill-toast it rather
than try to put the slices in a toaster, most of which don't take slices as
thick as I like to serve (and eat) of this particular bread. You can serve and
eat it with butter and marmalade, or any other type of jam, if you like, This
bread makes breakfast on Christmas Day that bit more special, which is just
what I aim to do on this, the best day of the year.

Ihad been wondering if this year's Christmas gift problems might be solved by
getting everyone a food book. There are so many angles on food, and so few
straight recipe collections, that the choice is wide for both cooks and
non-cooks. But now, looking through the pile I've collected, there is the
question of who should get what. Even more difficult is deciding which books I
can, or cannot, happily part with.
I am tempted to keep Darina Allen's Irish Traditional Cooking (Kyle Cathie,
#19.99) since she has written an evocative food book. Unpretentious and
informative, it's a portrait of the people and their foods, with a large recipe
collection.
The fascination for Scots is the similarity between the two Celtic food
cultures. If anything, though, the Irish are ahead of us when it comes to
inventive potato cooking. I am working my way through her repertoire of dishes
based on mashed potatoes and butter, otherwise known as champ. So far: spring
onion, parsley, chive, dulse, pea, and leek, but nettle will have to wait until
the spring. They're a reminder of the power of old potato, before we discovered
rice and pasta.
Also using potatoes, as their source of filling carbohydrate, were the Smoked
Haddock Fish Cakes which I made from Quaglino's: The Cookbook, by Richard
Whittington (Conran Octopus, #14.99) - and very good they were too. I've
flipped through the book to admire the stunning food photography and the
photojournalism in the first section which gives a lively picture of this
Terence Conran restaurant in operation. But now I'm happy to pass it on.
As I am with The Gastrodome Cookbook by Rory Ross (Conran Octopus, #17.99).
Similar in style, with superb design and luscious food pictures, this book
captures the cooking and atmosphere of the trio of Conran restaurants at
Butler's Wharf. Like Quaglino's, it's first and foremost an advert for the
restaurants, so I will give them both to I and C, who live in London and might
make use of them before sampling the restaurants.
I have decided not to part, however, with Silvija Davidson's Loaf, Crumb and
Crust (Michael Joseph, #17.99) in which she takes an original look - not at
baking breads, but at cooking with them. A subject which she has pursued in
cooking cultures around the world. There is still so much to read, so many
intriguing recipes to try. A state of affairs which also applies to Fiona
Armstrong's Commuter's Cookbook (Neil Wilson Publishing, #7.99). Anyone who
titles a chapter ``Easy, Easy, Easy . . . '' instantly commands the attention
of all cooks-in-a-hurry who know that it's possible to cook more cheaply from
scratch at speed, without compromising on quality, than reach for a ready-made.
But I will give Kit Chapman's Great British Chefs (Mitchell Beazley, #19.99) to
N, who works as a chef, and who will enjoy reading about the tortuous routes to
the top of the 18 chefs whose profiles are included in the book. Though I'm no
slouch when it comes to experimenting with food, I was not inspired to try any
of the recipes in this book. Rather than well-cooked food, looking good enough
to eat, there is an excess, to my mind, of hands-on, fussy plate presentation.
For S, who is a vegetarian, I have picked out Mary Gwynn's Vegetarian Food for
Friends (BBC Books, #12.99), though I will photocopy, before I hand over the
book, her recipes for Roasted Root Vegetables with Cranberry and Orange Sauce
and New Potato Casserole with Fresh Greens, both of which had enthusiastic
meat-eaters asking for seconds.
Harold Bagust's Breadmaking at Home (Hale, #25) will go to home-baker J, who
will, hopefully, appreciate a bread book with reliable recipes since Bagust
claims that he wrote the book because so many other bread books he'd used were
full of recipes which did not work.
And that's about it. Except for gardener-cooks R and G who will get the
stunningly beautiful, as well as practical, Bob Flowerdew's Complete Fruit
Book: A definitive source book to growing, harvesting and cooking fruit (Kyle
Cathie, 19.99) along with Jekka's Complete Herb Kit (Kyle Cathie, #9.99).
For last-minute stuffing into stockings on Christmas Eve, that leaves me with
the delightful A la Pym: The Barbara Pym Cookery Book by Hilary Pym and Honor
Wyatt (Prospect Books, #9.99) as well as One Year at Books for Cooks (Pryor
Publications, #3.99) which, besides providing a lively collection of recipes,
tried and tested in their little restaurant, also publicises London's
best-stocked cookbook shop.

Ken McCluskey - musician
n Best concert - This was The Clash Complete Control tour in 1978 when I was
still a plastic punk. It was held at The Apollo and was a real eye-opener.
There was no gobbing or posturing or posing. They were dead gallus, totally
cool and brilliant lyrics. After that I changed from a plastic to a real punk.
n Worst concert - This was when The Bluebells got invited over by the Maltese
government and we were supported by this awful heavy metal band who did awful
Jimi Hendrix covers. The guitarist used to dip his plectrum in petrol and set
fire to it while another guy would throw bangers on to the stage. Absolute
rubbish gig but a free week's holiday in Malta.

A SLICE OF LIFE
n Galina Samsova talks to Leila Farrah about a typical day's eating
MY breakfast is always Nescafe, although sometimes when I'm on tour I might
have breakfast with the company. Then more Nescafe until lunch. Normally I skip
lunch altogether: I'll really only eat a sandwich in the office three out of
six days or have a toasted ham and cheese sandwich at the pub over the road
because I like eating quite late. The only time I'll have a proper regular
lunch is on holiday in the South of France.
Food is a pleasure, I really love it and always did, but I particularly like
eating with friends. And I like cooking but not on my own. For myself I just do
tuna fish with beans and onions or something from Marks &amp; Spencer or Safeway.
But I have my great niece from Russia staying with me and she cooks for me
which is nice. We like Mexican chilli con carne and pasta. We do eat meat but
not serious pieces, just chops or meat in a pasta sauce.
I'm afraid I don't eat much fruit or salads, but I love tomato and basil salad
and always make a green salad if I have guests. Haricots and mange touts I
love. I always have a glass of wine in my kitchen, a dry white, such as
Frascati. La Brasserie in West Regent Street is a good place to go after a
performance and the food at La Parmigiana in Great Western Road is lovely.
My eating habits are the same as when I danced. I still lead the life of a
dancer and so I find that if I eat during the day I want to have a siesta. If I
eat between meals it'll be nuts or salami which I love. When I was dancing, I
was never on a diet in my life, but now I should be, as the hips tend to
stretch out.
I love Russian dishes like vinaigrette salads and kotletki cutlets which I make
in enough quantities for a whole week and just heat up. And I love Russian
soups but they take too long to prepare.
Being born and bred in Russia, I can't eat anything raw . . . I like looking at
steak tartare and fresh oysters but can't actually swallow them. Caviar and
smoked salmon are my favourite foods - I get quite a lot of the second but very
little of the first - except in Russia.
n GALINA Samsova was born in Stalingrad and began her career in Kiev,
eventually emigrating to the west with official permission. She has performed
as principal dancer with the National Ballet of Canada and the Sadler's Wells
Royal Ballet, the London Festival Ballet as Ballerina, and is acknowledged as
one of the greatest interpreters of the classical repertoire. Latterly, she
produces, and participates as juror in international ballet competitions. She
was appointed Artistic Director of Scottish Ballet in January 1991 and this
year was appointed Honorary Professor of Choreography in the Ukraine.

AS A CHILD our street was our territory. The town was our kingdom. There was
nothing beyond it. The news of the outside world was a meaningless babble that
chased children's programmes off the TV screen. We knew certain things: the
baby Jesus loved us, to be bold was bad, and Santa lived in the Co-op.
He was the king of the castle. As our eyes were not yet big enough to see
around our town, there could be nothing else. Of course, this was the real
Santa. Where else would he go? Other towns did not exist, besides it was such a
great home.
You had to climb four whole flights of stairs to reach his grotto. Each step
was huge. One Christmas we saw a movie with Tommy Steele as a broken doll,
discarded in the basement of a store, to be used as kindling for the Christmas
Day furnace. But he climbed all the steps to the toy department and Santa saved
him and his broken toy friends.
We got so excited: our Co-op was on the telly!
When you reached the top of the stairs you stood in line, back straight like
the big toy-soldier sentries and clutched your mum's hand - or your aunt's if
you'd told her you hadn't been to see Santa yet; even if you had. You would
then pray that Santa would not reach into the wrong sack, the pink one, instead
of the blue one for boys and you'd end up with Sindy.
It had happened before.
Father Renucci had already explained eternity, but you figured it was the
length of Christmas Eve. Which was how long it felt before the elf, a big girl
in green, ushered you through the tinsel drawbridge. You shut your eyes to
avoid the coloured strips of plastic and opened them after they had dragged
over the bobble of your hat.
And there he was, sitting on a chair draped in silver - Santa was smiling. He
smelt of oranges, talc, and old jumpers and you sat on his knee and answered
all his questions and you left clutching a bright parcel wrapped up with
red-holly sticky tape.
And as you grew up you never quite forgot, whatever they said. You wished he
was real, so he was real. And why shouldn't he be?
Today it is technology that makes the existence of Santa plausible. In the
Christmases past it could not be explained how one man could be in all those
department stores, down all those chimneys, and eat all those mince pies. But
today we have technology. If man with all his corruptions can design software
to send a billion messages to computer screens worldwide in less time than a
snowdrop takes to melt, then one ageless old man, fuelled on goodwill and
blessed by God as a saint, can gallop the information superhighway, pulled by
cyber-reindeers. Children today can e-mail Santa. I think it's
``sckidweb.gimmie.iwanna''.
It remains, however, the big-store visit to Santa's grotto which puts the match
to the festive spirit which can burn so bright, for so long. The relationship
between Jenners store in Edinburgh and the crimson-clad man extends back into
the last century - and he arrived for his winter season by carriage, swept
along Princes Street by two strong horses called Harvey and Storm.
Initial requests for an audience were rebuffed by the ladies at the perfume
counter: ``If you're looking for Santa, he's on the fourth floor but he doesn't
start till 11''. But out on the streetwere Claire Cherry and Stephen, her
four-year-old son, who were waiting for his imminent arrival. While Stephen
chewed at the handle of his mother's plastic bag - in acute anticipation,
obviously - she explained that her husband was Santa's driver and that another
carriage guest had included Julia Roberts while filming Mary Reilly in
Edinburgh.
I just had time to joke about asking Santa for Julia Roberts for Christmas when
they both appeared; Santa and Claire's husband, not Santa and Julia Roberts.
There appeared not to have been a lot of children around earlier but at the
first sight of their hero clip-clopping toward the pavement, dozens of little
hands were waving.
One little blond boy with woollen shark-shaped gloves was waving so hard it
resembled an aerial feeding frenzy. Stephen by this time had lost interest in
wandering round in circles and chewing plastic bags and was now drooling, his
jaw slack with awe.
After a brief photocall Santa in red robes and thick woollen beard - a bit like
an inquisitor, really - was striding through the front door, through the
perfume counter and on to an escalator. A stream of little boys and girls, held
by mums and grans, followed. While one little girl frantically tried to tug at
his robes another recoiled in terror, squirming in her gran's arms. The hike
upstairs led us through glassworks, menswear, bathroom accessories to the
fourth floor and rugs.
And here in a festive oasis, among sand-dunes of stacked Persian rugs, sat
Santa's log cabin, smaller, he would later confess, than last year's, but
cosier. While he strode through the front door, the children queued around the
red rope that weaved towards a side entrance. Santa soon settled into his chair
and then beckoned the first two children in.
Laura, 6!s, led her little brother David, 4!s, through the door (by his hood)
as his eyes resembled saucers staring at the mechanical elves relentlessly
wrapping gifts. After smiling and asking their names, while David chewed on his
toggle, Santa asked what they wanted for Christmas.
``Laura, honey, what would you like?'' he inquired gently.
``Blusher!'' she replied, while her mother leaned in the doorway, raising her
eyes to the strip-lighting.
``Oh, that's nice,'' said Santa, a little surprised, ``anything else?''
``Blusher, a make-up set and dressing-up clothes.''
Laura then had to whisper into her brother's ear that he wanted an Action Man
and he agreed, and so did Santa, but only if they were both very good, went to
bed early, and didn't grow up to be a Clueless model or mercenary soldier.
As they emerged the next child entered while the younger ones waiting in the
queue played trampoline on the Chinese superwashed 9ft x 6ft rugs, a snip at
#395. You could see the sales assistants on the floor staring into space,
watching their carpet sales drift out the window.
But Santa was on a roll. Besides, it was only an hour before he was off for
one. Lunch begins at midday in the Jenners magic kingdom. Before his break he
listened to four-year-old Grant splutter out how he would like a new bike
because his old one was going to a car-boot sale. Then there was the mother of
two little boys who had to explain that they weren't getting toy guns for
Christmas after one gave the other a black eye with the butt.
``Was it sore, did you cry?'' asked Santa. The boy nodded his head, sticking
out a petted lip. Santa promised to get him something better and so the sun
shone again. During a quiet point Santa's wife arrived to explain that his
grandchild had a cold and couldn't come. Maureen Kennedy, the store's
promotional manager, looked stricken: ``Santa doesn't have any children,'' she
corrected. But Santa said no, that's wrong,  he had millions.
Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of boys and girls, began as the Bishop of
Myra, an ancient city in Asia Minor. Legend said he began his good works by
saving a merchant's three daughters from being sold into slavery by heaving
sacks of gold into his back garden, saving them from the hell of the harem.
Wandering out of the dark ages he was re-employed after the Reformation by the
Germans, where his work spread throughout Europe to Britain. However it was the
Coca-Cola Company in America who redesigned his robes.
Yet when such a CV was mentioned to him, he only smiled and said: ``You may
think that but I couldn't possibly comment,'' before showing off his throne.
``Look at that chair,'' he said, ``what a beauty! I bet the first young boy I
held on my knee here will be an old man now. Time flies quickly.''
He explained that he could not be happier than when spreading festive joy. But
he saves his greatest rewards for the handicapped children who arrive in
organised visits. ``Last year a young spastic boy rushed in to see me and he
was crying with joy, shouting: `Santa, Santa!'. He hugged me, with his arms
round my neck so tight that I thought he would choke me. He was distraught when
his mother made him leave, yet so, so pleased to have met me.''
Blind children find a reassuring comfort in the feel of his beard and the soft
warmth of his furry boots - fake, of course. ``They'll spend ages feeling your
face and beard, just to make sure you are the real McCoy, or the real McClaus.
It's lovely. Not sad at all.''
Older girls often pay Father Christmas a house call: ``They'll ask me for a
millionaire for Christmas or a big hunky man.'' I did think about asking Santa
if he ever got a bit frisky, what with having sixth-form girls sitting on his
knee, but I thought better of it. He is the embodiment of goodness and light,
not dark, stockings and gym-slips.
At lunchtime we went to the staff canteen where Santa ordered sausage roll,
beans and chips. When the woman was pouring his tea he said, ``No milk,
please''. So I looked at him. ``C'mon, not in my tea. I'll take it straight
with some mince pies, but that's it.'' During our meal we were joined by a
mutual friend, Jimmy, who visits the store regularly after working there for 37
years.
As a trio we talked about Christmas past, present, and future.
Jimmy: ``I remember the first time I saw Santa. It was at a Sunday School party
and I must have been three or four. All the lights were turned out. The only
light came from the glow of the candles on the Christmas tree. From out of the
darkness came Santa - I couldn't believe it. I still remember it so clearly.''
Santa: ``So do I. You were nervous about collecting a parcel, so many small
children are, but you took it. What saddens me is that there are so many shabby
Santas in stores today, with costumes you could spit peas through. And they
charge! Can you imagine a child being told his parents can't afford to let him
see Santa?It's outrageous!''
Me: ``Well, what about the World Santa Claus Conference in Copenhagen last
July. The Finns boycotted, claiming Santa belongs to them alone. They said you
only come from Lapland. If the organisers can't dispense Christmas cheer what
hope have the rest of us?''
Santa: ``Plenty! Why it's all in the heart. Who needs officials, you've got
me!''
We all nodded and poked our beans around our plates.
As Santa left to feed the reindeers, wedging scraps into his belt, I went to
wander the store. From the outside Jenners resembles a Christmas present all
wrapped up in the scaffold and tarpaulin of a #2m restoration. Inside it
remains a wonderland of presents. It is either a commercial horror or people in
the act of giving. You have to choose which eyes to look through.
In the basement toy department, children's eyes were on stalks at the parade of
potential presents; Lego, Action Men, Sindys, the toys of my youth saved from
the furnace by popularity. One little boy was in the corner, trying to clamber
on to a rocking-horse while his mother prised open his gloved hands.
``You'll just have to wait and see what Santa brings,'' she said.
But he still wasn't happy. For a child, you see, Santa's visit will always
remain an eternity away.

THE KGB's LITERARY ARCHIVE
Vitaly Shentalinsky
Harvill Press, #18
LITERATURE
AFTER the suicide of the Soviet literary cheerleader Maya-kovsky in 1930, a
poem was found in his pocket.  One line stated: ``As they say, that's the end
of the story.'' It was not the end of the story.
Stalin described Mayakovsky as ``the best and most talented poet of our Soviet
epoch'' and ominously declared that ``indifference to his memory is a crime''.
It was obviously suicidal to interpret Mayakovsky's death as an expression of
despair at the horrific state of the Soviet Union.
At the first Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934, Isaac Babel made the fatal
mistake of suggesting Mayakovsky's suicide amounted to ``the poet's conclusion
that it was impossible to work under Soviet conditions''.
Accused of various crimes against the Soviet state, Babel was shot in 1940. A
literary master of the art of silence had been silenced though the secret
police withheld this information from his widow who was told, as late as 1947,
to look forward to Babel's release from the camps.
Stalin, and his secret police, had struck again. As the secret police files
examined by Vitaly Shentalinsky show, Stalin encouraged his secret police to
strike brutally again and again and again.
The day Stalin died - March 5, 1953 - Shentalinsky was 13. Shentalinsky's
father was the only man in his village with a radio so was the first to know
the news in his corner of a collective farm. He told Shentalinsky to spread the
news and he did and watched face after face fold into tears. Not tears of joy,
but tears of genuine anguish. In 1953 Shentalinsky had no idea Stalin was a
monster. He was not alone in his ignorance.
It now seems astonishing that Stalin was once widely regarded at home and
abroad as an avuncular figure on the side of the angels opposed to the diabolic
Hitler. Stalin, by this fiction, was the saviour of the Soviet Union and a man
who helped defeat a maniac.
In fact Stalin killed at least as many Russians as Hitler did. Stalin was
Hitler's soulmate, a murderer of millions of Russians. Among the millions were
many men and women of letters: some 1500 Russian writers died as a direct
result of their refusal to accept the authority of Stalin.
One of those Russian writers, the poet Osip Mandelstam, signed his own death
warrant when, at the request of his interrogator Shivarov in May 1934, he wrote
out the following anti-Stalinist satire (which I give in translation by
Vladimir Markov and Merrill Sparks):
``We exist in a country grown unreal and strange;/No one ten steps away hears
the talk we exchange./ But when chances for half-conversation appear,/We will
never omit the Kremlin mountaineer./Each thick finger, a fattened worm,
gesticulates,/And his words strike you like they were many-pound weights./His
full cockroach moustache hints a laughter benigning,/And the shafts of his
boots: always spotlessly shining./And the gang of thick-skinned leaders near
him obeys;/Semi-humans are at his disposal always./ Decree after decree he
incessantly coins/Which hit people on foreheads, eyebrows, eyes and groins./ He
possesses the broad chest, a Georgian perfection,/And each new death for him is
a berry confection.''
Mandelstam had never dared put his poem to paper before his intimidating
encounter with Shivarov.
In his cell in Lubyanka's inner prison, Mandelstam attempted suicide by
slashing the veins on both his wrists with a razor blade he had concealed in
the sole of his boot. He was saved by jailers who bound up his wrists. Saved
from a relatively quick death, so that he could suffer slowly until he died of
heart failure in a transit camp near Vladivostok in the winter of 1938.  KGB
files contain a letter written by Mandelstam's widow to Beria, head of the
Soviet secret police. It contained a question. Did the NKVD - the title of the
secret police of the time, after the fearful force was known as Cheka then GPU
then OGPU and before it was known as NKGB then MGB then MVD then KGB - have
``sufficient grounds for destroying a poet, a master''?
Beria did not bother to reply. He could do what he wanted until the death of
Stalin. And then he was done to death, on the orders of Khrushchev and others,
in December 1953.
So much death; and so much of it manufactured in the Lubyanka, headquarters of
the Soviet secret police from 1917. When Shentalinsky was allowed into the
Lubyanka to look at secret police files in 1989, a KGB official observed:
``You're the first writer, it seems, who has come here of his own free will.''
In the bad old days writers were taken to the Lubyanka to be beaten into
confessing crimes they had never committed. The files tell a sustained tale of
terror.
For example, the case file on Vsevolod Mayerhold preserves a letter written by
this theatrical genius who was arrested in 1939 for disagreeing with the
official doctrine of Socialist Realism:
``The investigators began to use force on me, a sick, 65-year-old man. I was
made to lie face down and then beaten on the soles of my feet and my spine with
a rubber strap . . . For the next few days, when those parts of my legs were
covered with extensive internal haemorrhaging, they again beat the
red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that it
felt as if boiling hot water was being poured on those sensitive areas. I
howled and wept from the pain. They beat my back with the same rubber strap and
punched my face, swinging their fists from a great height . . . I began to
incriminate myself in the hope that this, at least, would lead quickly to the
scaffold.''
Vsevolod Mayerhold was arrested in 1939 for disagreeing with the official
doctrine of Socialist Realism. He was shot in 1940, the same year as Babel, who
had doubtless endured the same atrocities.
Pavel Alexandrovich Florensky was taken to the Lubyanka in 1928 and
subsequently shot at Solovki islands camp in 1937 as Shentalinsky discovered
from the files. Honoured by his admirers as the Russian Leonardo da Vinci,
Florensky was a mathematician, physicist, inventor, engineer, priest and author
of The Pillar and Ground of the Truth (1913) - an influential exploration of
spiritual values.
His ``crime'', of course, was having an Orthodox faith in an unorthodox Soviet
state. He told his interrogators he was well disposed towards the Soviet Union
as a force capable of improving the condition of the common people but he was
done for and duly became yet another victim of Soviet violence.
Another was Boris Pilnyak - author of The Hungry Year (1921) - who was shot in
the same year as Florensky. Another was Nikolay Klyuev, a peasant poet also
shot in 1937. Yet another was Vladimir Kirshon, a playwright shot in 1938.
Shentalinsky's book (translated from the Russian and expertly annotated by Jon
Crowfoot) explains why some Soviet citizens - take the case of Marina Tsvetaeva
- killed themselves rather than face the official consequences of their own
creativity. And why other Soviet citizens - take the case of Maxim Gorky -
killed their own creativity by cooperating with Stalinism.
Shentalinsky has not told the whole story because so many documents were
destroyed: ``For years a soot-stained chimney released a stream of smoke over
the Lubyanka and for decades sprinkled Moscow with the ash of incinerated
manuscripts.'' But he has mastered his distressing material, and he
convincingly tells the terrifying truth about the Stalinist terror.
