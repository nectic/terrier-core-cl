THE Phoenix is starting to fly again. After several years with its
head tucked shyly under its wing, the massive development on the former
Linwood car plant site has flapped its wings by clinching the first
property deals following its relaunch via a new marketing campaign and
revised master plan.
The Chivas and Glenlivet Group is constructing an 11,500 sq metre
export distribution and warehouse facility on the 300-acre site's
commercial park. Eric Easson, vice president packaging operations and
customer services, said: ''It will provide us with state-of-the-art
high-bay warehousing facilities which will enable us to achieve greater
efficiencies and enhanced customer service.
''The locational advantages offered by The Phoenix were a major factor
in our decision to transfer our finished goods warehousing and
distribution operations to the development. The site provides the space
we need and excellent accessibility to the motorway network.''
Alcatel Business Systems Limited is The Phoenix's second new occupant.
The international telecommunications company has taken a 10-year lease
on office premises in one of the three business pavilions in the
development's business park. The firm will relocate its regional HQ from
Glasgow city centre.
Alcatel's premises manager Gerry Tilbrook said: ''These premises
provide us with better quality acommodation in a prime location adjacent
to Glasgow Airport and close to the motorway network.''
These are the first deals to be agreed since the recent launch of a
new master plan for the mixed use office, industrial, retail, and
business park scheme. Additional deals are also in negotiation, claims
Phoenix project director Barry Lucas.
He said: ''The deals reflect the gathering momentum of our new
planning and marketing strategy.''
The master plan was prepared by planners Arup Urban Design and
landscape architects Charles Funke Associates, and includes plans for a
business park of 33 hectares, a commercial park of 34 hectares, a
five-hectare autopark and retail and leisure areas totalling a further
42 hectares.
Window found in office market
A NEW office building is coming onto the Glasgow market this week.
With the city's supply of quality space steadily diminishing, the
letting agents are optimistic that 131 St Vincent Street (left) will
find tenants fairly quickly.
The 23,000 sq ft development comprises two adjacent buildings, with
contrasting facades, which have been linked internally to provide
floorplates of around 3500 sq ft on most of the seven storeys. The
development is by Hill Samuel Life Assurance in association with London
&amp; Wiltshire Northern Ltd.
The building has an impressive entrance hall and some interesting
interior features and attractive windows. It comes with underground
parking for 11 cars. Joint letting agents are Ryden and Conrad Ritblat
Sinclair Goldsmith.
Ewan Cameron of Ryden is confident that the building's location and
specification will find willing tenants. ''This is the only new building
on St Vincent Street at the moment -- and one of only two new buildings
to come onto the city centre market this year. It deserves a single
tenant, ideally a financial services company or quality professional
firm seeking a self-contained HQ.''
The agents are quoting rentals of #18.50 per sq ft per annum, an
optimistic target in the current quiescent market. But Cameron concedes
that deals are possible.
''We're not daft. We'd like to achieve that top rent, but we're
willing to discuss packages with potential tenants -- depending on the
length of the lease and the strength of the occupier's covenant.''
More privatised new town letting
THE privatisation of Scotland's new town industrial portfolios
continues to generate activity in the market.
Highcross (Livingston) Ltd, purchasers of Livingston's Houston
Industrial Estate has concluded three further lettings.
The new tenants are: Thistle Chemicals which took 9000 sq ft in Unit
20, Napier Square, at a rental of #30,000 per annum; Gibson Print Ltd
whose lease of 2765 sq ft at 16 Napier Square is costing #11,000 per
annum; and Tele-Aerials Satellite Ltd who took 2765 sq ft at 5 Napier
Square at a #10,000 per annum.
Joint letting agents Ryden and Drivers Jonas have concluded 11 new
lettings on the estate since Highcross (Livingston) Ltd purchased a
portfolio of industrial property from Livingston Development Corporation
in September 1994.
The available remaining units range from 1500 sq ft to 23,000 sq ft.
Meanwhile, East Kilbride's Scottish Enterprise Technology Park has
achieved two new deals. Clyde River Purification Board has taken a
20-year lease on the 10,600 sq ft Bramah building. The board will use
the new space to house its Inspectorate and Hydrology staff while
retaining its adjacent HQ in Murray Road.
The park has also attracted Thermal Transfer, an environmental and
engineering company, into an existing 7000 sq ft building to be re-named
Transfer House.
The Technology Park is being improved by its owners, Lanarkshire
Development Agency. Obsolete buildings are being demolished to create
development sites and LDA has committed more than #1m for a
refurbishment of the James Watt Business Centre and the creation of the
new Strathclyde Software Innovation Centre on the park.
Niall McGilp, LDA's property and environment director, said: ''I am
confident that as redevelopment continues we will continue to attract
many more high-tech companies to the Park.

I KNEW an old guy who told the truth about something and was jailed
for sedition. He started reading the novels of Jane Austen found in the
prison library and thought them sublime. Halfway through the last book
they told him his time was up and he must leave the premises. He pleaded
for another day inside, that he might finish it.
That's the magic of Jane, maiden aunt, daughter of a country
clergyman. In her novels nothing much seems to happen. People die
considerately, off stage, lest they remind us of our own mortality. Her
heroines seldom leave the drawing rooms or gardens of the landed gentry
except for forays to Bath and London for the ''Season''.
She lived through the French Revolution and the wars of the Napoleonic
Empire, yet not a word of these events appear in her writings. It seems
like a formula for mind-boggling boredom, but it isn't.
Her books fizz with excitements, comic caricatures, and barely
containable understated passions which stimulate the imagination in a
way that a more sexually explicit writer cannot do. There are minor and
major dramas, and a wicked sense of humour at work. She was one of the
best novelist/satirists ever to breathe a genteel breath.
She never went beyond the confines of the social groupings to which
she belonged. But it's wrong to interpret this as acceptance of a status
quo whose banalities she obviously loathed. Her writings are an
onslaught on the values and cruelties of her times, in which young
ladies were bred for breeding and marriage, preferably with sires of
great wealth. She was a feminist before the word was coined, but
wouldn't have been seen dead in dungarees.
She wrote for the enjoyment of family and friends and had to be
persuaded to have them published for wider circulation. The rest is
history. Two hundred years on we are still mesmerised by her insights.
The BBC's serialisation of Pride and Prejudice is outstanding and brings
Jane to a new generation, hopefully sparking off renewed interest in her
novels.
Viewers will already have noted that young Army officers in P and P
are portrayed as brainless twits, and that's because they were brainless
twits. These were times when the landed gentry bought commissions for
the less intellectually endowed of their male progeny. The NCOs ran the
Army while the officers rode with hounds and whored in brothels.
The intellectual vacuity of most officers was still extant when I was
doing my National Service in the RAF. During initial training we were
given political lectures and at the opening session the officer said
that in here, the lecture room, there was no rank, and we should frankly
express our opinions, without fear or inhibition.
We took him at his word and it soon became clear that he hadn't a
clue, nor did any of the other officers. They were simply reading a
briefing, written by others, probably descendants of Attila the Hun.
Another factor was operating. We were sick to the back teeth of being
bawled at by skin-headed, bone-headed, bampots called drill instructors
who operated a system calculated to take away our dignity and make us
more malleable to their every command. The lecture room was where we
could hit back with impunity, and did.
Our squad became the talk of the NAAFI, and a funny thing happened:
our drill instructors became rather proud of their rookies, who were
dancing rings round the officers in debate and showed plenty of bottle
in doing so.
To be honest, dancing rings round these officers was no great thing,
for they were spectacularly dense. The intellectual failures of the
British middle class were still being dumped in the armed forces.
But things changed. You couldn't hand a hi-tech, multi-million pound
military aircraft, to unintelligent Hooray Henries. As the military
became more hi-tech, officer recruitment and promotion had to be based
on ability, and nothing else.
We now probably have the most intelligent officer cadre in the history
of the British armed forces. Listen to them explain operational
difficulties in Bosnia, and you know you're listening to intelligent
men.
In July 1988 I received a letter.
''Dear Mr Reid, Along with many other Servicemen I very much enjoyed
your recent television series, Reid About the USSR, and found it
compelling viewing. As we move, hopefully, to a Europe with fewer
tensions we are trying to follow and understand the seminal changes in
the Soviet Union. Your insights and those of your colleagues help to put
flesh on the dry bones of official assessments.''
Then followed an invitation to a black-tie dinner in the Royal
Artillery Mess, Woolwich, with about 40 flag, general, and air officers.
Later, in the more informal atmosphere of the Music Room, I was to speak
and answer questions.
The letter was from Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Walker KCB, Deputy
Chief of Defence Staff. I accepted the invitation. The dinner was
splendid in a room that only lacked Errol Flynn fencing on top of the
table. But the questions and discussion were a real eye opener. There
were no blimps. Instead there was intelligence and a firm grasp of the
complexities of a deadly critical situation in what was the USSR.
THE Soviet economy was doomed, it didn't work. A quick collapse would
lead to anarchy which could destabilise the whole landmass. The pace of
economic change had to be managed and moderated. The military top brass
understood, our politicians didn't.
Britain today, as the Army of yore, is led by dunderheads. Politicians
reply to debates with speeches written before the debate, and get away
with it. Spin doctors make crass career politicians look like St Francis
of Assisi. Oh for a new Jane Austen to mock their evil pomposities.
In the meantime, enjoy the old Jane, courtesy of the Beeb.

GARY Armstrong was the star of the show yesterday at the official
launch of his autobiography in Edinburgh, but on Saturday it will be
back to ''auld claes and porridge'' as the Jed-Forest scrum-half
undertakes his latest injury comeback in the Tennents Premiership
Division II top-of-the-table clash against Currie.
Armstrong will be making his first appearance since suffering a sprung
rib cartilage five weeks ago in the opening game of the championship
season against GHK.
Yesterday, as he relaxed at the launch with Scotland teammates Craig
Chalmers, Kenny Logan and Kenny Milne, his dream of an international
comeback was the last thing on his mind.
''I just want to get through Saturday OK, and after that it's a
question of taking it one game at a time.
''I've looked forward too often in the past only to be disappointed by
one injury or another.
''I'm desperate to get back into a Scotland shirt but from now on it
will be a case of taking it one step at a time,'' he said.
''The injury situation had been getting so bad that my five-year-old
son Darren is beginning to take the mickey.
''He said to me the other day that if I make it to half-time on
Saturday then I would get an orange.''
The autobiography, Jethart's Here! The Gary Armstrong Story, which has
been serialised in The Herald this week, was co-written by the paper's
chief rugby writer Derek Douglas.
Armstrong added: ''Hopefully folk will like the book, and if they have
half as much fun reading it as we have had in writing it, then I'm sure
they will.''

CELTIC were last night accused of holding their supporters to ransom
over the purchase of tickets for the club's European Cup-winners' Cup
clash with Paris St Germain in two weeks.
The match will be played in the Parc des Princes on October 19, and
yesterday the Parkhead club announced a change in their normal European
policy by stating that tickets for the second round, first-leg game can
only be purchased from a single travel agent named by Celtic.
The company involved, Cambuslang Travel, organised Celtic's trip to
Georgia in the first round. Now they will handle all ticket sales on
behalf of the club, and that brought a blast from rival company owner
Harry Hynds, whose Baillieston-based company already have accepted more
than 200 bookings from Celtic supporters.
''I have been organising travel to European games for Celtic fans for
more than 20 years,'' said Hynds. ''Earlier this season I wrote to
Celtic Football Club asking for permission to take supporters to
European matches. In a letter from Fergus McCann, I was told that
permission was not necessary although ticket sales would be handled by
the club.
''Now the club have changed their stance and are allowing just one
travel agent to handle tickets. I have season-ticket holders and
shareholders who have booked with me -- now I am being told tickets
might not be available.
''What is angering my customers is that the deal I have offered costs
less than a similar deal with the company named by Celtic. It can cost
some fans an extra #35, and that cannot be right.
''I have asked for an explanation from the club and am still hoping to
resolve the affair.''
Celtic defend their policy shift by pointing out that there is great
concern that their supporters will be on the Continent at the same time
as Rangers' fans who play Juventus in Turin 24 hours earlier.
Parkhead managing director Fergus McCann said: Safety has been our
No.1 consideration in appointing a sole handling agent. Rangers
supporters are also travelling within Europe that week and we are in
discussion with Rangers, the police, and others concerned and seek to
control travel of supporters to ensure and safety and comfort for all
concerned.''
Club spokesman Peter McLean added: ''The Port authorities, ourselves,
and Rangers are concerned over the prospect of rivals fans meeting up in
France. We want to avoid that and so, because of these security reasons,
we have decided that only season-ticket holders or corporate customers
will be allowed to purchase tickets, and that all ticket sales will be
strictly controlled by Cambuslang Travel.
''As far as we are concerned there is a wide range of travel options
available through that company and these will suit the various needs of
the supporters. Safety and security are the governing factors.''
Later last night, McLean added: ''We have talked with the supporters'
association and there is a worry that a demand for tickets will outstrip
the allocation we will receive.''

IAN Ferguson added to the injury worries for Rangers yesterday after
he had a foot placed in plaster following a late injury in the victory
over Motherwell at Ibrox on Tuesday night, writes Ken Gallacher.
He joined Paul Gascoigne and Ally McCoist in the treatment room as
manager Walter Smith counted the cost of the three points which
confirmed the champions' position at the top of the premier division.
There was no better news regarding Gascoigne or McCoist yesterday, and
Smith said: ''We won't be able to put a date on their return until we
have had a chance to look properly at the injuries.
''At the moment, we hope they will be ready for our Champions' League
game in Turin against Juventus, but it will be very close to the game
before we will be able to say whether or not they will play.''
Ferguson will have his foot immobilised for a week, which will rule
him out of the next game at Pittodrie, but he should be ready for the
European match.
As for this weekend, Smith was able to point out that other injured
players will be back in place for the Aberdeen clash.
''Stephen Wright was out against Motherwell with a bruised toe,'' he
pointed out, ''and that won't be enough to make him miss our next game.
I would expect David Robertson and Oleg Salenko to be back in place as
well.
''In the short term we have players returning but, in the long term,
looking towards Europe, we still have these worries over major
players.''
Danish internationalist Brian Laudrup is already out of the reckoning
for the Juventus match because of his nagging ankle knock.
Neither Gascoigne nor McCoist will be with their respective countries
on international duty in Norway and Sweden next midweek.

Falkirk 0, Celtic 1
JOHN Hughes returned to Brockville in triumph last night with the goal
which gave his new club, Celtic, victory over Falkirk -- the team he
skippered until his transfer to Parkhead at the start of the season.
The goal was a long time in coming, but that scarcely mattered to
Hughes who raced to the Celtic supporters behind the goal, kissing his
jersey in celebration. Earlier, Hughes had been jeered by the Brockville
support who had once idolised him.
The goal which gave Celtic all three points must have been all the
sweeter for him as the fans who had taunted him fell silent.
It was little enough reward for the Parkhead men who had subjected
Falkirk to fierce spells of pressure throughout the game -- but
particularly in the second half. There must have been times when the
players wondered if they would ever score.
Then in stepped Hughes
He was up in the penalty box when Andreas Thom swung in a corner from
the left. He rose above the challenges from the Falkirk defenders and
powered a header down and over the line. The ball was struck with such
power that it bounced high into the roof of the net as Hughes turned
away, punching the air.
Poor Billy Lamont, who had been brought back into the Brockville goal,
had no chance. Indeed few goalkeepers would have been able to stop the
header.
Lamont, freed by Falkirk in the summer, was recalled by manager John
Lambie in a bid to solve his goalkeeping crisis. And the keeper, still
without a club, played superbly. Ask Celtic about that.
It was only that special header in the 78th minute which finally
defeated him. As if that was not enough for Falkirk to bear, they had
Jamie McGowan sent off six minutes from the end.
McGowan had been yellow-carded earlier in the second half for a foul
on Pierre van Hooydonk. When he tripped the Dutchman again after 84
minutes, the referee had no alternative but to caution him again -- and
off he went.
Celtic had surprised their support before the start by fielding their
latest signing Jackie McNamara, who had been bought from Dunfermline in
the afternoon.
Manager Tommy Burns paid #600,000 for the Scotland Under-21 defender,
who will be 22 later this month. McNamara has now followed his father,
also Jackie, into a Celtic team.
The youngster settled in comfortably and forced Lamont into a save
after only seven minutes with a long-range shot which the keeper fumbled
before pushing away for a corner. At that early stage Lamont seemed
nervous, uncertain of himself, on his Brockville comeback.
It was the second half before he displayed some heroics. By then
Falkirk had been able to hang on desperately, keeping the score level at
half-time.
But even their most loyal fans must have wondered how they could
continue to do so. They managed for long enough and Lamont was partly
responsible for their survival.
In 50 minutes he came from goal to block a low shot from van Hooydonk
with his knees after Andreas Thom had sent the Dutchman free in the
penalty box. In 58 minutes he foiled the giant striker once more when he
saved a low, vicious free kick from 35 yards at the second attempt.
Then, just three minutes later, he hurled himself to his left to hold a
fierce drive from John Collins.
By now Falkirk were on the ropes, with few attempts at attacking play
coming from them. In 72 minutes, Gordon Marshall did save a low shot
from Mo Johnston, and then the keeper held a speculative long range try
from David Elliot under the bar.
But Celtic kept throwing men forward until eventually they got their
reward.
By that time Falkirk had lost both John Clark and Steve Fulton through
injury with Joe McLaughlin and Brian Rice taking over. They also had
Scott McKenzie booked for a foul on Collins and McGowan collected his
first yellow card as they desperately tried to stem the tide.
There were times when it seemed as if they might succeed in holding
on, times when Celtic looked as if they would be frustrated by the
defiant Lamont and by their own careless finishing.
However, McNamara was given a winning debut and said afterwards: ''It
took me some time to become used to the pace of the game. Everything
happened very quickly. I signed at lunchtime and then was here playing
tonight. The manager simply told me to play the way I had been playing
with Dunfermline, to get the ball down, and play football.
Celtic had gone into the game without skipper Paul McStay and
international left back Tosh McKinlay. Both players failed late fitness
tests but Peter Grant returned, and Jamie McQuilken took over at left
back.
The victory was important for the Parkhead side especially following
the disappointment of their Old Firm defeat at the weekend.
The result means they remain chasing Rangers at the top of the table.
FALKIRK -- Lamont, Clark, McGowan, McKenzie, Weir, Fulton, Kirk,
Ferguson, McDonald, Johnston, Elliot. Substitutes -- Rice, McGrillen,
McLaughlin.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McQuilken, McNamara, Hughes, Grant,
Donnelly, McLaughlin, van Hooydonk, Thom, Collins. Substitutes --
Walker, Bonner, Hay.
Referee: J D K Smith (Troon).

THE Glasgow chaps have a smile on their faces, as well they might. A
game has been set up against the mighty Leicester at Wellford Road for
January 13, which is a bit of a feather in the cap for Hamish Fyfe and
company.
If we all have to accept that the real way ahead is to generate this
type of high-level competition, then the Glasgow initiative is to be
congratulated, and it will generate some amount of interest.
''We are delighted to have such prestigious opposition as Leicester,''
said Fyfe, the Glasgow convenor. ''We hope that they will come back to
play us next year, and we will be playing them at age-group levels as
well.''
Kevin Greene, the Glasgow Accies and Waikato Super Ten coach, is to
prepare the Glasgow team for the Leicester match and for the scheduled
game against Griqualand West on 13 November.
However, it now appears that Scotstoun will not be ready for the game,
and Hughenden, after all, will be used. The projected progress of
Scotstoun as a rugby ground appears to have been a little optimistic.
When I was down there last week there were hordes of kids playing
football and ripping the surface up in grand old style.
A Glasgow fixture against Connacht has been arranged for December 16,
which was a free weekend.
* OH, the poor people of Cyprus. They are having to contend with Peter
Wright, Derek Stark, and David Laird, all from Boroughmuir, who are
across there playing in the Cyprus 10's this week. What hardship for our
Edinburgh trio.
The team they are playing for is sponsored by oil money from the
North, and, following strict SRU and SFA guidelines as to the make-up of
the touring party, of the 42 people on the trip only 12 are players.
Bill Hogg would no doubt approve.
Our three heroes will be suitably tanned and back in time for their
club's game against Heriot's on Saturday, even if there has to be a mad
dash by taxi from the airport as they only arrive back on the day. What
was that Brian Gilbert said again about Glasgow players? When the tough
get going . . .
* TOUGHER tales reach us from Strathaven. Whitecraigs were shocked to
find when they played Strathaven 3rd XV on Saturday that among their
opponents was a rather capable 19-year-old wing forward of the other sex
called Sarah Beaney.
She was not averse to shouting: ''Get your hands out of there,'' to
great effect, which not only showed a strength of character more
advanced than her years, but rather disconcerted some of the Whitecraigs
chaps, as well it might, and presented her with some welcome space on
the field of play.
Oh to have been a fly on the wall . . . or a prop.
Sarah is a third year BEd. at Moray House and has ambitions of playing
at the highest level for Scotland's women's team -- she has been to
divisional trials -- and her dedication is such that she persuaded
Strathaven to hire step benches for five weeks as she took the boys for
pre-season, aerobic training.
I'm game for a woman behind every man, unless she's playing second row
that is.
* EASTON Roy, a boyish 73-year-old and fresh back from his holidays in
Canada, has been down looking for a game at the Stirling County
veterans, otherwise known as the Woolfhounds.
''It's just not fair,'' said Easton, out of puff from one of his
arduous twice-daily exercise routines. Night and morning he works out in
his gym, when I caught up with him this week. ''They have taken to
picking the young things and that's just not fair, which was why I went
to play for St Modan's last year.
''I had heard that the captain had gone, so I went down to look around
for a game, but the captain's still there. Somebody said that if I go to
McLaren High I'll get a game.''
I have to admit that Easton has been something of a hero to me over
the years -- the indomitable rugby player that won't be deterred from
his game by anything.
As tough as anything is Easton. His fame has come about through a
sequence of events that have included getting his friends to wash his
dirty rugby kit so that his wife never found out, starting each day with
a cold shower, and on one famous occasion, finding himself ejected from
a game for propping while still wearing the metal brace a local hospital
had given him to help heal an injury caused by going head first off his
bike into a braking vehicle in front of him.
Oh, the romance of it all.
* I have been trying to live down the fact that two Hastings, a
Lineen, and a Glasgow beat me over six miles.
Trouble is that it was Diane and Jenny Hastings, and Lynne Lineen.
Yup, the wives, and Jenny is six months pregnant. Plus, Ron Glasgow,
father of the three brothers, last played for Scotland in 1965. All that
training with Steve Cram was camera tricks.
* A FINAL thought. There's no doubt that foreign players have helped
some of the better off clubs. So, who's going to buy O J?

Camanachd Association in their bid to ease the continuing difficulties
with referees' shortages.
The Camanachd Association recently appealed to clubs to put forward
names to assist with matches at under-14, under-17 and third division
level. Clubs were asked to nominate players, and officials who might be
able to assist when they weren't otherwise committed with games.
So far only Strathglass, Ballachulish and Kyles -- who have forwarded
four names each -- and Strachur, who have nominated two, have replied.
Association Secretary Alister MacIntyre will now be writing to clubs
expressing the Association's disappointment with the dismal response.
Senior clubs in areas such as Badenoch and Oban have not put names
forward and now President Duncan Cameron says it may be time to target
specific areas in an attempt to alleviate the problem.
Inveraray's success so far this season has been recognised in the
first of the season's Marine Harvest Awards. Inveraray receive the #100
first prize for their electrifying start to the new national league
programme.

HOW about this one for the rugby quiz night. ''What do Scotland caps
Gary Armstrong, Craig Joiner and Martin Scott all have in common?'' To
save the flood of postcards, here is the answer: They all at one stage
attended Dunfermline High School.
It is perhaps appropriate as Armstrong prepares to make his return to
the international stage that his old school is also enjoying something
of a revival of fortunes, judging by their early season results.
''We had a couple of lean seasons, but this year we have a stronger
first side,'' says John Kubrycht, who is in charge of rugby at the
school. Strong indeed with two Scottish Schools props, Malcolm Welch
(under-16 cap) and Keith Dickenson (under-15 cap) giving bulk to the
front row.
''That certainly helps rugby further down the school. First-year
pupils have something to aim for,'' says Kubrycht. ''They can see that
they can achieve some success through rugby.''
Dunfermline High, undefeated so far this season, may not be on the
independent school circuit, but they have an extensive fixture list.
Indicative of Dunfermline High's commitment to rugby is the fact that
every Saturday the school fields six teams -- first and second XVs,
third and second-year sides, and two first-year teams.
But importantly this is not to the exclusion of other sport. ''We also
run a full complement of football teams,'' states Kubrycht.
* TO celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of Jordanhill School, a
Glasgow Schools team will play a Jordanhill School Select at Hughenden
on Wednesday, October 11, kick-off 6.30.

MURRAYFIELD Royals look certain to be minus a player-coach for this
weekend's home double header.
Dave Gregory's unexpected departure to join Guildford Flames on
Tuesday sparked two days of telephone calls to find a replacement, but
to no avail.
Royals have lost their first 10 games this season, eight of them in
the Benson and Hedges Cup, and two in the first division.
Team manager Billie Dunbar said: ''Gregory's move came out of the
blue. He doubled his money, got a flat from Guildford, and they are
bringing his family over. We can't compete with that.''

THE National Basketball Association of America and the Converse
company are joining forces with one of the least-known clubs in
Scotland, Glasgow Gators, to promote the Converse NBA 3-on-3 Tour event,
which will go ahead at Bellahouston Sports Centre on Saturday and
Sunday.
The club are in Strathclyde League Division 3, and are the platform
adopted for developing the sport on the west side of the city by Glasgow
basketball development officer, Warren Read.
Originally, the event was to have taken place in Kelvin Way, but the
danger of wet leaves on the road at this time of year was considerable.
Bellahouston has the advantage of being able to offer outdoor and indoor
facilities should the weather prove unreliable.
The SBA are surprised that little or no consultation has taken place
with them over an occasion which ought to have provided an opportunity
to market the sport.
Some 28 European cities are taking part in this year's tour which
claims to have attracted more than 70,000 participants in its first two
years.
But the event is essentially a summer festival and to come to Scotland
in early October was always going to be a high-risk strategy, although
there was little alternative, as finding dates in July and August would
have been difficult.

Lothian Schools 31, South Schools 17
LOTHIAN made a successfull start to their defence of the Bank of
Scotland Schools Under-18 title, which they jointly hold with Glasgow,
at Myreside yesterday.
Under the direction of the talented Gordon Ross, the Scottish Schools
stand-off, Lothian's backs threatened to over-run South in the first
half, but crucial cover tackling kept the try count to one, Andy
Raistrick claiming a touchdown from a break by Jason Walkinshaw.
Ross, with a conversion and three penalties, helped his side to a 16-0
half-time lead, but a surprise was in store for the Lothian side as
South suddenly found their form. Two tries by centre Dougal Affleck,
both converted by stand-off Chris Paterson, and then a penalty by Gary
McGarva gave South the lead.
However, Lothian reasserted themselves, first through a Ross drop-goal
and then tries by flanker Tom Palmer and centre Marcus di Rollo, the
latter's score converted by Ross.

NICOLA Steel has suffered at the hands of Scotland's get-tough
swimming policy, but a hat trick of titles at last weekend's
Inter-District championships proved she could yet arise from the scrap
heap.
The 18-year-old, a regular internationalist since 1993, was among the
unlucky losers in last year's Commonwealth Games selection, and she just
missed a qualifying time for this season's Scottish squad.
''I've started work as a pool attendant at the local leisure centre
and training is no longer the be-all and end-all,'' said the Aberdeen
teenager.
However, she remains keen to return to the Scottish scene, and next
month's Cumbernauld International Meet and the Scottish Winter
championships in Ayr in December remain the pre-Christmas targets.
Meanwhile, Stirling University's three internationalists -- Forbes
Dunlop, Kerry Martin, and Pauline McLean -- enjoyed a boost yesterday
with the announcement of a #3000 sponsorship deal with Dunblane Hydro.
This weekend, the 10-strong Scottish squad -- Dunlop, Martin, McLean,
Graeme Smith, Fraser Walker, Alison Sheppard, Kirsty Hope, Richard Hope,
Cameron Black, and Tom Griffith -- have all been invited to the first of
the season's fitness monitoring sessions at East Kilbride.

FOUR expenses-paid marathon trips to New York and London can be won by
leading Scottish men and women in next year's national half marathon and
marathon championships.
This incentive, to enhance road and cross-country running, is part of
a package unveiled by the Scottish Athletics Federation following a
review and restructuring of the sport.
The first Scots male and female in the Scottish half marathon
championship will go to New York, while places in the London event are
available to the leading home man and woman in the national marathon
championship.
The opportunity exists, for race organisers, to boost their event and
have it given championship status. Applications should be made by the
end of this month.
The road and cross-country commission wish to phase incentives
progressively for each age group, from young athletes through to
veterans. The award structure for the increasing number of veterans is
to be improved.
A total of #11,000 this year, and #7000 per annum in future, will be
spent by SAF on revamping the competition structure, but almost
certainly reducing fixtures longterm.
Incentives will rise within each age group, and from one group to
another. These will consist of an award scheme, district representative
award, residential weekend, and age group representative match.
Some of the very best senior competitors in all disciplines including
track, road and country, have already been offered contracts which could
be worth between #1200 and #1500 per year.
In return they must commit themselves to championships and
internationals, and be available for marketing and promotional
activities for SAF or sponsors.
Progressively phased racing incentives are offered in return. District
championships will be used to select Inter-district and Inter-counties
teams; the SAF championships producing the British championship team;
and half marathon producing the team for the Great North Run.
There will be an SAF Road Running Championship day, on March 17,
similar to that for cross-country, to increase the focus on road
running, and an inaugural 50k championship.
The drive for increased participation will be backed by an in-service
training programme for teachers, via Regional education departments;
more fun runs at existing events; an education and training programme,
and schools partnerships.
* THE first development initiative, a series of six 3000m races for
under-13, 15, and 17 year-olds, male and female, will be held on
Saturday (10.15 declaration, 50p per head) from St Thomas Aquinas
School, Scotstoun, Glasgow. Entry on the day.
* KENYAN Benson Masya, thrice winner of the Great North Run, will
compete in Sunday's BUPA Great South Run (10 miles) at Portsmouth, it
was confirmed yesterday. He will face Gary Staines, winner in Edinburgh
last Sunday, and fellow-Kenyan John Ngugi, the former Olympic 5000m
champion.

Partick Thistle 1, Kilmarnock 1
KILMARNOCK gained their first league point of the season at Firhill
last night --and they may well have travelled back down the road to
Ayrshire feeling they should have also recorded their first victory. But
at the end of the night the side who lost their first five matches,
scoring only one goal in the process, had to rely on some unexpected
assistance from Thistle.
The Rugby Park side had fallen behind when Firhill captain Albert
Craig converted a hotly disputed penalty after Robert Connor was judged
to have fouled Derek McWilliams, and just as it looked as it was going
to be another one of those nights for them Lady Luck finally smiled on
the men in blue and white.
Just before half-time a harmless looking cross floated into the
penalty area and, although he was under no pressure, central defender
Gregg Watson took a swipe at the ball and looked back in horror as it
spiralled high into his own net past a stranded Nicky Walker.
There wasn't a great deal between the sides in terms of possession in
the early stages, but the problem was that neither team seemed to know
what to do when they got within the danger areas, although Gibson
brought out a handy save from Lekovic following a corner on the right.
Kilmarnock, however, should have scored in 14 minutes, when Whitworth
rose at the far post to head down a cross from Mitchell. The ball fell
between Wright and Brown only afew yards from goal, but Wright
completely missed his kick and a definite chance had been squandered.
The Rugby Park side missed another great chance a few minutes later,
when Brown put McKee clean through, but he steered his shot wide of the
post with only the keeper to beat. And what a costly miss it was, for
Thistle swept to the other end to take the lead in 20 minutes. Connor
was judged to have tripped McWilliams in the box and Craig calmly
slotted in the penalty kick.
Whatever other faults Kilmarnock have shown this season their
determination has never been in doubt and they were desperately unlucky
when a cracking 25-yard drive from Connor smacked off the bar.
The visitors' frustration extended to the dug-out near the interval,
when the referee went over and had a long talk with Kilmarnock manager
Alex Totten, but when play resumed the Ayrshire side again tried to go
forward at every opportunity and three minutes from the interval their
luck turned.
A harmless looking cross dropped inside the box and Watson, in
attempting to clear, sliced the ball high into his own net.
Kilmarnock started the second half with Maskrey on for Brown, who had
earlier taken a knock, and in 53 minutes Thistle also changed their
attack with Docherty coming on for Gibson.
With the wind behind them and Colin McKee being given too much space
on the left, Kilmarnock looked the likelier side after the interval and
in an effort to change that Thistle sent on Cameron for Kevin McKee
after 66 minutes.
Kilmarnock, however, still looked the more positive and impressive
although, apart from a thundering drive by Wright which only narrowly
missed the target, they could not really cause the Thistle defence any
real anxiety. With five minutes left Thistle sent on their third
substitution, Curran for Craig.
There were five bookings in a match which was hard but mainly played
in a sporting manner -- McDonald and Milne, of Partick Thistle, and
Kilmarnock's Anderson, Wright and Mitchell.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, Dinnie, Milne, McKee, Welsh, Watson,
McDonald, Craig, Gibson, Turner, McWilliams. Substitutes -- Docherty,
Cameron, Curran.
KILMARNOCK -- Lekovic, McPherson, Black, Skilling, Whitworth,
Anderson, Mitchell, Connor, Wright, Brown, McKee. Substitutes --
Montgomery, Henry, Maskrey.
Referee -- S Dougal (Burnside).

COLIN Montgomerie, relaxed and confident after returning to the top of
the European money list, believes his game has improved by up to 30%
over the past two years. However, the Scot feels he may have to move up
yet another gear to thwart the twin threat of Sam Torrance and Bernhard
Langer if he is to finish at the head of the Volvo Order of Merit for
the third successive year.
Tuning up for the Mercedes German Masters, which starts in Berlin
today, Montgomerie said: ''Two years ago I was #50,000 behind Nick Faldo
going into the Valderrama Masters, the last tournament of the season,
and I won it and finished European No.1 for the first time.
''Since then I've got better and better. Last year, at Valderrama, I
was so far ahead in the money I only had to hit the first ball off the
tee and I was No.1 again.
''Now, with just this week's tournament and Valderrama to come, I have
to beat off the challenge of both Sam Torrance and Bernhard Langer to
stay at the top.''
Montgomerie is currently only #980 ahead of Torrance and #128,687
clear of Langer, who moved back into the frame by winning the European
Open in Dublin last week.
''Originally, I didn't intend to play in Berlin, because this will be
my seventh straight week counting the Ryder Cup and I'm very tired,''
said Montgomerie.
''But I've set my heart on being No.1 again, so I shall play the last
two counting tournaments -- plus the World Matchplay and Dunhill Cup --
and then have a 10-week holiday.
''If I don't keep playing now I think I may regret it later, and if
you don't play, you can't win.''
Montgomerie's wife, Eimear, is expecting their second child in January
and, for the Ryder Cup star, the timing could not be better. ''The baby
is due on January 28 and that will be during my time off,'' he said.
''The Order of Merit is now a three-horse race with Bernhard (Langer)
back in the ring after winning on Sunday. But I've been very consistent
this year and I'm a better golfer, mentally, emotionally and technically
than ever before. I'm playing with a lot of confidence.''
He added: ''I'm pretty good, but I haven't yet reached my peak. I
still make a few silly mistakes and I must learn to eradicate them.''
Torrance, like Montgomerie, believes that Langer will be a big threat
this week. ''Bernhard always plays well in his own country and, after
last week, there is no knowing what he might do,'' he said.
''I only finished joint twenty-fourth last week, but in a way it was a
relief not to be in contention. I think it refreshed me and this week
could be my turn.''
Langer, modest as ever, would only say: ''It looks like the No.1 spot
will be between Monty and Sam, because I know I will have to win here to
stay in the race.''
Will he win? Langer merely smiles and replies: ''Why not?''
* PROFESSIONAL Andrew Marshall (Kingsknowe) won the second East of
Scotland Golfers' Alliance outing of the season by a stroke with a
three-under-par 68 at Bathgate yesterday.
Marshall, two under to the turn in 34, had an eagle 3 at the 505-yard
twelfth hole, but followed with a bogey 4 at the next to be back in 34.
Richard Johnston (Glenbervie) faltered over the back nine after going
out in 33 and tied with Ian Young for second place on 69, but won the
handicap with a net 67 off 2. Leading scores:
Scratch: 68 -- A Marshall (Kingsknowe). 69 -- R Johnston (Glenbervie),
I Young (Braid Hills DR). 71 -- S Callan (Dalmahoy). 72 -- J Clarkson
(Harburn), N Shillinglaw (Glencorse), C Brooks (Glencorse).
Handicap: 67 -- Johnston (2). 68 -- D Robertson (Bathgate, 9). 69 --
Clarkson (3). 72 -- Shillinglaw (scr), M Louden (Glencorse, 4).
Assistants: 76 -- S Gray (Musselburgh).

Stirling Albion 1,

STENHOUSEMUIR survived second half pressure from Stirling to march
into the final of the Challenge Cup.
They started as they meant to go on with Fisher crossing dangerously
on two occasions and only good goalkeeping from Monaghan prevented them
from going ahead.
However, the Stirling keeper could do nothing to stop the visitors
taking the lead with 26 minutes played. A long ball from keeper McKenzie
saw Gareth Hutchison control well before shooting home.
Stirling tried to get back into the match straight away, but when
McLeod set up Tait 25 yards out he sliced wide.
Two minutes later 'Muir went further ahead. Albion failed to clear at
the edge of their box and a shot deflected to Paul Logan on the right
and he struck the ball low into the left-hand corner.
The home team pulled one back seconds after the restart when McLeod
found himself clear on the left and crossed low and hard to the back
post for McCormick to stroke the ball into the net from close range.
0  With nine minutes to go Stirling substitute Watters curled a free
kick over the wall only to see McKenzie reach to his left and touch the
ball over the bar.
STIRLING ALBION -- Monaghan, Paterson, Gibson, Mitchell, McQuilter,

SCOTLAND crashed to defeat at the hands of reigning champions England
in the first match of the four-cornered Women's Home International
series over the Wrexham course in north Wales yesterday.
They lost all three morning foursomes, and although they rallied in
the afternoon to gain some respectability, it was too little too late,
and they went down by 6-3. Today they will attempt to pick up the pieces
when they face Ireland.
There was no doubting the superiority of the English in the morning
foursomes. All three games were won with something to spare and in each
case the English duo finished off their rivals with a birdie, quite a
remarkable statistic.
At the top of the singles order there was a fascinating tussle between
Stirling's Alison Rose and Julie Hall, the English and British champion,
and that finished with honours even. Both players went round in about
par and a half was a fair result.
Hilary Monaghan from Longniddry, the Scottish champion, also secured a
half point for her country in a tense duel with Lisa Walton.
But defeats for Lesley Nicholson and Lindsey Roxburgh spelt the end of
the Scottish challenge, although they did win the last two games through
Sharon McMaster and Jayne Ford.
Scottish captain Gladys Cadden has made one significant change in her
foursomes pairings for this morning. She has omitted Anne Laing and put
Caroline Agnew in alongside Lindsey Roxburgh and they will face Yvonne
Cassidy and Suzanne Fanagan, sister of one of the Great Britain and
Ireland Walker Cup heroes, Jody.
Ireland and Wales shared the honours in the other match yesterday.
Scotland 3, England 6 (Scottish players first). Foursomes -- A Rose
and L Nicholson lost to J Hall and L Walton, 4 and 3; L Roxburgh and A
Laing lost to E Duggleby and E Fields, 3 and 2; J Ford and S McMaster
lost to E Ratcliffe and K Stupples, 4 and 3.
Singles -- Rose halved with Hall; H Monaghan halved with Walton;
Nicholson lost to J Oliver, 4 and 3; Roxburgh lost to Fields, 3 and 2;
McMaster beat Stupples, 2 holes; Ford beat S Lambert, 2 and 1.
Other match: Ireland 4[1/2], Wales 4[1/2].

Raith Rovers 3, Hibernian 0
MAYBE he wasn't shaking in his Gucci shoes but Wolfgang Dremler, a
coach with Bayern Munich, went home last night with a healthy respect
for the Rovers of Kirkcaldy after having seen their destruction of Hibs
at Stark's Park.
The Fifers' UEFA Cup opponents might have imagined from league
positions that Hibs would show them how to deal with Raith, but they
would have been wrong. The capital side were ambushed by a Rovers team
that once again illustrated that it is very capable of scoring goals.
Colin Cameron scored early to boost their confidence, and when David
Sinclair and Cameron again hit two more in a three-minute spell in the
second half, Rovers were uncatchable and celebrated their biggest win in
the premier division to date.
Hibs unbeaten league record look vulnerable even before Rovers had
taken the lead . . . and that was in 13 minutes. Dair, who was very much
involved when the goal did come, might well have scored when he took a
fine pass from Cameron, slipped inside two defenders, but then spoiled
it all with a weak finish that did not test Jim Leighton.
However, the Scotland keeper could do little about the goal that did
beat him soon after. Chris Jackson had given the ball away inside the
penalty area to Graham who passed it to Dair, and when he laid his pass
in front of Cameron, the final shot was so firmly struck that Leighton
was able only to touch it on its way into the net.
As so often happens, Raith lost their way after that goal and Hibs
could easily have levelled matters inside a couple of minutes. O'Neill
hit a free kick over the Fife defence to Wright who chested the ball
down, but as he tried to flick it over Thomson, the keeper manager to
divert it over.
There followed an alarming period for Rovers when they seemed to find
great difficulty getting the ball out of their penalty area and Wright
came close again when he reached a Chris Jackson cross, but his header
hit the keeper and went past for a corner.
However, when Leighton and Tweed got into an astonishing mix-up,
Cameron almost snatched his second goal and that relief encouraged the
Fifers into more aggressive action.
Whenever Hibs did move forward the speed of O'Neill and Harper seemed
sure to provide the breakthrough they were seeking, yet Rovers posed as
much threat when they broke clear themselves and the result was an
entertaining and attacking contest.
Hibs began the second half as if they would sweep Rovers down their
own slope, but again they walked in to a sucker punch and managed to
wander into another a few minutes later.
A corner by Dair on the left caught the defence off guard, and
Sinclair rose to head high over Leighton. The Fifers did it again three
minutes later, once more from a corner on the left. Dair took a short
one this time, accepted the return pass, and when his cross came over
there was Sinclair again heading it forward, but it was Cameron who
wheeled and hit the ball past the keeper to leave Hibs stunned.
Near the end Hibs' Gareth Evans was booked.
RAITH ROVERS -- Thomson, Kirkwood, Broddle, Coyle, Dennis, Sinclair,
McInally, Cameron, Graham, Lennon, Dair. Substitutes -- Crawford,
Taylor, Raeside.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, Donald, Love, McGinlay, Tweed, Hunter, Harper,
C Jackson, Wright, D Jackson, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Evans, Dods,
Miller.
Referee -- L Thow (Ayr).

KENNY Nairn took the first-round lead in the Assistants' Autumn
Classic at Kilspindie yesterday with a four-under-par 65 as blustery
conditions blew the majority of competitors off course.
The Hilton Park assistant's score across the 5423-yard East Lothian
course included an eagle 2 at the closing hole and edged him one stroke
clear of local player David Drysdale, who was out in the first group,
and former Scottish Amateur champion Craig Everett.
Former Assistants' order of merit winner Euan McIntosh looms one
stroke behind with Scottish Assistants' champion Alan Tait carding a 68.
Leading first-round scores:
65 -- K Nairn (Hilton Park).
66 -- D Drysdale (Dunbar), C Everett (Caldwell).
67 -- E McIntosh (Braid Hills).
68 -- S Greig (Crail), S Kennedy (Pitreavie), J Wither (Paisley), A
Tait (Cawder).
69 -- C Morris (Duddingston), M King (Pitreavie).
* PETER Kinloch, of Cardross, returned a net 70 to win the Standfast
Quaich for amateurs in the West of Scotland Golfers' Alliance Meeting at
Fereneze yesterday. Leading scores:
70 -- P Kinloch (Cardross, 5). 72 -- E McAree (Bonnyton, 12).
73 -- D McCaffery (Westerwood, 9), J Rennie (Douglas Park, 11), D
Henson (Buchanan Castle, 12). 74 -- R Farrell (East Kilbride, 12).
Amateur scratch: 72 -- C Green (Dumbarton). Professional: 72 -- G
Mitchell (Clydeway). 73 -- B Lockie (Kilmarnock Barassie), A McCloskey
(Airdrie), A Forrow (Whitecraigs).
* HOST professional Frank Rennie put his local knowledge of the
Prestwick links to good use yesterday when he guided his team to victory
in the MHF Charity Pro-Am.
Rennie and his three amateur partners -- under the banner of John
Beresford &amp; Company Development Ltd -- carded a six-under-par 65 to win
the TSB Scotland-sponsored event by two strokes. Leading scores:
65 -- John Beresford &amp; Company Development Ltd (F Rennie,
Prestwick, A Walker 14, M Dickson 7, A McCluskey 12). 67 -- TSB Scotland
Treasury (B Lockie, Kilmarnock Barassie, D Hughson 15, S Steven 4, K

FIVE-TIMES Tour de France champion Miguel Indurain won his first world
title yesterday when he swept to victory in the road time trial at the
World championships in Colombia. The Spaniard completed the 43-kilometre
course through the mountains in 55 minutes 30.4 seconds.
He finished nearly 50 seconds of his nearest rival, compatriot Abraham
Olano, who finished in 56-19.1. Germany's Uwe Peschel was third in
57-33.9.
It was quickly clear that Indurain, who started last, would win the
race comfortably as he completed the first 21 kilometres in 24-21.0
minutes, compared to Olano's 25-24.7. Scotland's Graeme Obree did well
to finish twenty-first in 1-01-16.4.

Hearts 1, Aberdeen 2
JOHN Robertson edged closer to a Hearts scoring record, but the
striker's contribution was not enough for his side to avoid defeat
against an Aberdeen team which is growing in confidence.
The slender, but thoroughly deserved, win at Tynecastle sends them
into Saturday's top game against premier division leaders Rangers with a
full tank of optimism.
However, by way of contrast, Hearts were left looking forlorn and
without much hope. In fact, their manager, Jim Jefferies, was scathing
of his players, saying that too many of them lack: ''the desire to be
winners. The bottom line is they are not good enough.''
The manner in which they allowed Aberdeen to take the points was
alarming, and the two goals lost could be described as gifts.
Their opponents, of course, were delighted to accept and went on to
display the change which has come over them since last season, when they
struggled to avoid the humiliation of relegation.
Rangers manager Walter Smith was one of the spectators who saw
Aberdeen move in front after 19 minutes when Joe Miller's cross from the
left arrived in Hearts' box. When the ball evaded Scott Booth, the
Edinburgh side's defenders may have thought the immediate danger had
passed, but Billy Dodds was lurking unmarked at the far side of goal,
and his shot squirmed under Craig Nelson's body and into the net.
However, Hearts dragged themselves back into contention six minutes
later and Robertson, who moved into joint second place with Tommy Walker
in Hearts' record books with a goal against Hibernian on Sunday,
pounced.
Alan Lawrence stroked the ball through to Robertson who caught John
Inglis wrong-footed, and the striker took his league tally to 185, which
is 21 behind Jimmy Wardhaugh who holds the Hearts' record for league
goals.
When the sides resumed after the break Hearts were sluggish and almost
immediately Aberdeen sensed the weakness when Colin Miller attempted to
clear and succeeded only in hitting the ball straight to Peter
Hetherston. The midfield player, perhaps surprised, should have scored
instead of hitting his shot wide of the goal.
Aberdeen netted their second after one of their former players, David
Winnie, fouled Booth in 59 minutes, and when Stephen Glass's free kick
dropped in the heart of the opposition's box, defenders stood still
allowing Booth free passage. He took advantage and directed a free
header into the net.
Hearts took off Lawrence and sent on John Colquhoun, but nothing much
changed although the Tynecastle side did step up the pace towards the
end when Robertson and John Millar demanded good saves from Michael
Watt, who has emerged as a better keeper than many people had suspected.
However, Aberdeen were not about to give up their advantage.
Aitken was delighted with his team's work and said: ''They are due
credit because they played some quality football and they were also
prepared to battle when they had to. I'm pleased I now have a solid
group of players to pick from, and I have competition in most
departments which is the way it should be.
''The players are building up reputations and respect again and they
now have another big challenge on Saturday. The mood is good and we are
all looking forward to it.''
Jefferies was almost overcome with despair even almost an hour after
the final whistle. ''I can't understand why players can do it in some
games and not in others,'' he said, ''and there can only one of two
reasons for the problem.
''Either the players can't take anything in or they are just not good
enough. Their effort is fine but the bottom line may be they don't have
it.''
Jefferies was without half a dozen key players because of injury and
suspension and he had expected those who came in to make more of their
opportunities.
''Maybe this group of players have been struggling for too long,
something like four or five years and under various managers, and they
may have heard it all before. It looks as though change is what is
needed, but at this stage there is not a penny available, and it is not
easy to push through swap deals.''
HEARTS -- Nelson, Wright, Winnie, Miller, McPherson, Hamilton,
Leitch, Lawrence, Robertson, Millar, Hagen. Substitutes -- Colquhoun,
Ritchie, Smith.
ABERDEEN -- Watt, McKimmie, Woodthorpe, Hetherston, Inglis, Smith,

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry defeated Terry Griffiths for the
fifteenth time in succession yesterday to reach the semi-finals of the
Thailand Classic in Bangkok.
Hendry sealed a 5-0 win in 70 minutes and now meet either John Higgins
or John Parrott for a place in the final of a tournament which carries a
first prize of #40,000.
Hendry fired in breaks of 83, 68, 60, and 40 as he strolled to victory

Nigel Bond joined Hendry in the semi-finals after having beaten Joe
Swail 5-4, taking the last three frames to gain his success.

THE sponsors may not have been too happy last night but fans of
Millwall, Stoke, and Bradford will not be caring after these clubs sent
much more fashionable sides crashing out of the Coca-Cola Cup south of
the Border.
Biggest surprise of the evening came at Goodison Park where first
division Millwall beat Joe Royle's Everton 4-2 after extra time. Andy
Hinchcliffe and Graham Stuart put the home side two up after 55 minutes.
But then the fun started.
Scott Taylor and Alex Rae put the tie into extra-time, in which Taylor
and Maurice Doyle clinched victory.
Canadian Paul Peschisolido was Stoke's hero when they reached the next
round at the expense of Chelsea, the Potters winning 1-0, while Ian
Ormondroyd left it very late before giving Bradford victory against
Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.
German striker Uwe Rosler provided some welcome relief for Manchester
City manager Alan Ball by guiding the Premiership strugglers to a 4-0
victory over Wycombe, while Ray Harford was another top-flight manager
to breath a sigh of relief as Blackburn beat Swindon 2-0 at Ewood Park
for a 5-2 overall victory.
There was excitement at Roker Park just before the half-hour mark --
but for the wrong reasons. Sunderland's Martin Smith was dismissed for
fighting after 27 minutes, and a minute later, Liverpool's Rob Jones was
red carded for the same reason.
However, when the dust settled, Robbie Fowler netted his ninth goal of
the season to give Liverpool a victory.

Dunfermline 0,
Dundee United 4
THE loss of highly rated defender Jackie McNamara, who signed
yesterday for Celtic, could prove to be more significant for Dunfermline
than at first appreciated.
The Pars were swept aside by a determined Dundee United in last
night's Scottish League Challenge Cup semi-final.
Dunfermline boss Bert Paton chose to relegate club captain Norrie
McCathie to the bench, a tactic which appeared to backfire after only
three minutes. Andy McLaren's corner from the right saw Christian Dailly
rise to direct a header past the bemused Guido Van de Kamp.
The Tannadice men increased their lead 11 minutes later when Robbie
Winters broke clear, flicked the ball over the head of Van de Kamp and
followed up to steer it into the unguarded net.
The visitors virtually secured their place in the final six minutes
from the interval when McLaren's cross was headed home by Johnson.
United recorded their fourth goal in 61 minutes, Winters heading into
the net from close range after yet another superb cross from McLaren.
United's fine victory was tarnished 10 minutes from time when Winters
was red carded following an incident spotted by the linesman.
DUNFERMLINE -- Van de Kamp, Den Bieman, Fleming, Tod, Fenwick, Smith,
McCulloch, Robertson, Shaw, Petrie, Kinnaird. Substitutes -- McCathie,
Farrell, Westwater.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, Perry, Shannon, Gray, Dailly, Malpas,

DEREK Baird has not kicked a rugby ball in earnest since 1988, but the
former schoolboy wing forward has been agile enough to outpace even
Scotland's leading points scorer, Currie stand off Ally Donaldson, to
lead The Herald Rugby Selector competition.
Baird, from Alloway in Ayrshire, has amassed 316 points in the opening
month of the contest, placing his Team Viking first of more than 5000
entries. He wins #500 and a case of champagne, and puts himself in
contention for the overall prize of a trip for two to see Scotland
challenge the All Blacks next summer in New Zealand.
A 25-year-old surveyor with Strathclyde Regional Council, Baird has
not played the game since leaving school, but he is a member of Ayr
rugby club and attends all their matches. His winning team for
September, as notified to us by Scottish Rugby, is:
Chris Richards (Jef-Forest); Gary Parker (Melrose), Ian Jardine
(Stirling County), Marrick Tonkin (Currie), Derek Stark (Boroughmuir);
Craig Chalmers (Melrose), Fraser Stott (West of Scotland); John Manson
(Stirling County), Gordon Bulloch (West of Scotland), Mike Stanaway
(Watsonians), Stewart Campbell (Dundee HS FP), Murray Rudkin
(Watsonians), Kevin Armstrong (Jed-Forest) Stuart Reid (Boroughmuir),
Nick Penny (Stewart's/Melville FP).
The winning team for the opening five-Saturday month did not contain
the name of Donaldson, the leading Selector Rugby points scorer with a
rating of 102. Donaldson modestly did nominate himself in the Real
Currie team which he entered, but still has fallen 10 points behind
Baird, while the competition's early leader, Gail Steele, from Dumfries,
is third on 298. Leading 20 teams and ties:
1, D Baird (Alloway) 316; 2, A Donaldson (Balerno) 306; 3, G Steele
(Dumfries) 298; 4, R Wood (Livingston) 290; 5, A Barnett (Glasgow) 289;
6, N Anderson (Edinburgh) 280; 7, K Murdoch (Troon) 275; 8, L Reynolds
(Glasgow) 271; 9 equal, A McTaggart (Dalry) and CJ O'Neill (Hamilton)
267; 11, K Stevenson (Troon) 266; 12, L Greer, (Glasgow) 263; 13 equal,
D Beckwith (Troon) and M Greer (Glasgow) 262; 15 equal, N Anderson
(Kelso), M Greer and L Greer (both Glasgow) 261; 18, A Donaldson
(Balerno) 260; 19 equal, M Greer (Glasgow), R Henry (Helmsdale), and E
Donaldson (Balerno) 259.
There must be heated discussion about the merits of players in the
Donaldson's Balerno household. Ally has two teams in the top 20, while
his wife, Elaine, is equal twentieth. Brothers Luke and Mark Greer, from
Kelvinside, have five teams in the top 20, and another occupant of the
household, Victoria Cassidy, also has two teams in the top 50.
To help you check how your team is faring -- no calls, please, to The
Herald or Scottish Rugby -- we give the ratings (right) to the end of
September, for all 160 players who were drawn from Premier League
divisions one and two.

PETER Monteith, with four winners, has taken an early lead in the race
for The Herald Scottish National Hunt Trainers' title, and at Hexham on
Saturday he will be hoping to add to that total.
Runner-up to Len Lungo last season with 18 successes, Monteith knows
he must chalk up as many as possible at this stage if he is to have any
chance against his Dumfriesshire rival.
Monteith had a double with Beldine, whose 13 victories have earned him
more than #40,000, and Wild Rose of York at the Northumberland course
last week. On Saturday, ground conditions permitting, he could have four
runners -- Electric Committee, Juke Box Billy, Killimor Lad, and Master
Bavard.
Killimor Lad, favourite at Kelso, was decisively beaten after an
expensive jumping mistake, while Master Bavard, led over the last only
to be overtaken on the run-in.
Monteith has all 28 boxes occupied at his Whitebog yard, but is
pessimistic about beating the reigning champion who, with a minimum of
35 jumpers, not only has strength in numbers, but an abundance of
winners and talented prospects.
Nine Scottish trainers have had winners so far, four of them women.
Linda Perratt and Dorothy Thomson have each had one success, Susan
Bradburne had a double at Perth in August, and Lucinda Russell has had
two from three runners.
Dawn Goodfellow, winner of The Herald's Leading Permit-Holders Award,
has yet to score. She will probably have a runner at Hexham where her
novice chaser, Leading Prospect, will revert to hurdles. Current
positions:
Peter Monteith 4; Tom Dyer, Susan Bradburne, Tom Kemp, Lucinda Russell
2; Dorothy Thomson, Linda Perratt, Colin Parker, Bruce Mactaggart 1.

FLEMING Japanese Investment Trust plans to cash in on expected gains
in the Tokyo stock market by raising up to #100m through a placing and
offer of new shares.
Fund manager Robert Fleming said it had already received firm
indications of demand for more than 33 million conversion shares at 100p
each.
Any shares not taken up in the placing would be offered to
shareholders and warrant holders of the Japanese Investment Trust and to
the public in general, it added. The closing date for applications is
October 26.
Fleming said this was an opportune time to invest in Japan because the
Tokyo stock market was poised to bounce off recent lows and begin a new
period of growth.
It said the fall in the yen and Japanese interest rates and the
Government's 14.2 trillion yen (#88bn) package of measures to stimulate
the economy had created conditions for company profits to grow and for
the local stock market to recover.

Stewart Harris of KPMG may surprise you with some statistics on the
benefits of exporting. He also has plenty of sound advice for any
businesses contemplating overseas markets
COULD exporting be a route to growing your business? It certainly
could if the latest Royal Bank of Scotland quarterly survey of exporters
is anything to go by.
It shows that smaller companies in particular are finding exports
significantly more profitable than home market sales.
It also shows that Scottish companies are taking the lead in
increasing export activity and that they show a greater improvement in
export performance and profitability than their English counterparts.
Consider these figures. On export performance Scottish companies
showed a 51.2% increase on the previous quarter, compared with 42.7% for
the North of England, 47% for the Midlands, and 40% for the South. On
export profitability they recorded a 10.7% increase compared with a
decrease of 0.8% in the North of England, and increases of only 4.4% in
the Midlands and 7.5% in the South.
Despite companies being less optimistic than they were about exports
to non-European countries, overall the survey confirms that exports are
continuing to be one of the key factors leading towards economic
recovery.
Moreover, a recent survey undertaken by the Scottish Council
Development and Industry and British Telecom showed there was a
significant correlation between a firm's export behaviour and its
growth. That data suggested that an optimum level of exporting for a
Scottish company was between 25% and 50% of turnover.
However, despite the benefits of exporting, a badly-managed expansion
into the world market can be costly and unnecessarily stressful. There
are also a number of pitfalls and problem areas. For example, the Royal
Bank survey showed that 22% of exporters described late payment as a
serious problem, with Europe the worst culprit, while Asia presented the
least problems in this area.
One way to avoid late payment is not to regard exporting as simply
selling more of your product in a foreign market but to think in terms
of a distribution network, or franchising, licensing knowledge, or a
subsidiary or joint venture.
Research conducted by KPMG into the views of Scottish institutions and
mid-sized companies into joint ventures revealed that:
* 80% of Scottish institutions had provided funding for joint ventures
in the last two years.
* 65% of Scottish companies would consider a joint venture.
Carrying on business in foreign markets will normally mean you rely
initially on a foreign individual or company and, from a commercial
perspective, choosing the right partner is fundamental.
There are, however, many other considerations which should be
addressed at an early stage. These include:
* The legal and capital structure of the venture.
* The initial funding and consideration of subsequent cash withdrawal.
* The commitment and flexibilty of the respective partners.
* The taxation and VAT issues associated with operating abroad.
* Local legislation which may have an impact on the product the
exporter is trying to introduce to the foreign market.
It is, therefore, fundamentally important to seek proper professional
advice, particularly at the outset. KPMG has produced a checklist which
sets out the issues to consider.
That said, remember that your company's first exposure to exporting
could be closer to home than you realise. The Republic of Ireland is the
UK's sixth-largest market worldwide but was only Scotland's 13th most
important export destination in 1993.
It goes without saying, therefore, that this is an ideal market for
first-time exporters. Consider the benefits:
* The wide use of British standards and sizes.
* No language problems, meaning no special labelling, packaging and so
on.
* Similar business practices to Scotland.
* And, as a general rule, if it sells in Scotland, it will sell in the
Republic.
Scottish companies are not expected to face this hazardous journey
alone. Scottish Trade International, which brings together the
international trade activities of the Scottish Office Industry
Department and Scottish Enterprise, acts as agent for the DTI in
delivering the Government's overseas trade services.
It also enables companies to access export information databases and
publications, including hints to exporters, country profiles, economic
and product sector reports.
In addition, there are a number of recognised schemes which provide
assistance to exporters. These include:
* Export Marketing Research Scheme
For companies employing fewer than 200 people, a grant of up to half
of the cost (up to a maximum of #20,000 per project) is available for
commissioning professional consultants to carry out market research
overseas.
* Scottish Export Assistance Scheme
A grant is available for approved costs of implementing an export
marketing plan in new markets outwith the EU. The maximum is #30,000 and
eligible expenses may include overseas accommodation, staff costs, sales
promotion, training, and other commercial and legal costs. In return, a
royalty of 5% of all sales generated from the chosen markets is payable
to Scottish Enterprise. This is up to a maximum of twice the funds
provided by the scheme.
* Market Information Inquiry Service
A report, at subsidised cost, on the prospects of selling specific
products in a particular overseas market.
* Export Representative Service
A report, again at subsidised cost, on finding the right
representatives abroad, including agents, importers and distributors.
The report includes details of the trading interests, capabilities,
scope of activities and facilities of recommended businesses.
* Overseas Status Report Service
Again available at subsidised cost, this is a report to help
businesses which have been introduced to or approached by an overseas
company to decide whether it is the right one to do business with.
STI also develops its own programmes to help companies, such as the
use of a network of contractors to identify sales, joint ventures,
licensing and technology transfer opportunities.
It is clear that the rewards of exporting are potentially high and,
with the proper planning and advice, it could become a major new market
for your business.

THERE is a widespread consensus that the whisky industry is shooting
itself in the foot by continuing to sell spirit at heavily discounted
prices. The problem is nobody seems willing to do anything about it.
The directors of whisky firms recoil in horror at the suggestion of
some sort of collective action to boost prices.
The thought of Seagrams, Allied Domecq and United Distillers banding
together in an Opec-style cartel makes industry bosses choke on their
malt.
Instead, they prefer to mutter platitudes about their own exemplary
behaviour and point accusing fingers at their competitors.
But the steady erosion of prices must be stopped for the good of all.
As Ian Bankier, the managing director of Burn Stewart Distillers,
pointed out yesterday, only the whisky industry itself can provide a
solution to the problem.
Willie Philips, the managing director of another small independent
distiller, Macallan-Glenlivet, rang the same alarm bells last month,
urging companies to stop competing on the basis of ''less than
realistic'' pricing.
The industry majors remain notably silent on the issue, but there are
some indications that a strategy rethink is under way at distant
boardrooms in London and the United States, aimed at restoring flagging
profits.
The most visible sign of this has been a spate of personnel changes.
Finn Johnsson, a Swede, has taken over the reins at United Distillers
and Ken Hitchcock, a tough-talking Australian, has swept like a fresh
breeze into Whyte and MacKay. David Jarvis has, meanwhile, departed from
Allied Domecq without a direct replacement.
Mr Hitchcock says he wants to change whisky's dowdy image among young
people, even if this means encouraging them to adulterate the golden
nectar with Coca-Cola, as many of his fellow Australians do already.
United Distillers is also trying to throw off the ''heather and
haggis'' image in its new television adverts for Bell's which are
targeted specifically at the younger generation.
Perhaps charging 5p a tot more for whisky, serving it in a purple
tinted glass, drowning it with some disgusting mixer and adding a slice
of kiwi fruit is the way forward.

IT comes as a bit of a surprise and perhaps gives Hewden Stuart
chairman Sandy Findlay grim satisfaction that even after yesterday's
9[1/2]p fall in the share price to 133[1/2]p, the plant hire company's
market capitalisation of #370m is exceeded only by the well-based
housebuilder, Beazer and just three construction companies Tarmac,
Taylor Woodrow, and Wimpey.
This is not a perfect measure by any means but it does indicate that
there would be a lack of resources if construction activity increased in
Britain over the next couple of years.
Many companies have cut back to the bone. Others are still trading but
they should have been taken over by now in a more efficient market --
Alfred McAlpine and Costain are just two of the most obvious candidates.
Part of the problem is that an excellent idea, the Private Finance
Initiative, has come to dominate all new construction and smother it in
paperwork.
A hospital or perhaps a local authority that wants to build a school
has to seek first private finance for all projects costing more than
#200,000 and the bureaucratic constipation has affected almost all
activity.
One example is of 56 small projects being lumped together in a #90m
package and involving a substantial number of sub-contractors.
The construction industry is praying daily that funds will be released
-- soon is too late -- even more so is the Budget on November 28.
Ominously Hewden Stuart's leading indicator, the sale of products in
its merchandising stores, fell in both August and September even if
overall hire levels were generally a little better. That deterioration
points to further loss of confidence and pressure on cash flow by its
building and construction industry customers.
What better way to cheer the Tory faithful at next week's party
conference in Brighton than to release these pent-up funds.

GUESTS attending the Capital Copiers exhibition will be among the
first in the city to see new digital black-and-white copiers being
produced by Sharp and Canon and designed to be central to the modern
office.
''These units can perform as stand-alone copiers or as a high-speed
high-output laser printer for a PC network,'' said Bill Burns, Capital's
sales manager for Glasgow.
''They represent the latest technological developments in office
equipment; highly versatile and allowing what used to be regarded as
stand alone items to now be connected to a network to form part of an
integrated system.
''They continue the theme of the Missing Link solution which will be a
main attraction for many of the people from firms large and small who
will be visiting Capital Copiers next week.
''The latest copiers can be multi-functional, fulfilling a variety of
roles, perhaps as a scanner or in a computer network. The
black-and-white and the colour laser copiers, new or rebuilt, from Sharp
and Canon are fully covered by our unique Lifetime Guarantee on the
product.
''More people use copiers now than ever before and improvements in
technology have brought powerful and versatile machines into the price
range of even the smallest business. The same can be said for most other
items of office equipment as visitors to the exhibition will see,'' said
Bill Burns.

<TEXT>
THERE appears to have been a distinct softening in the Confederation
of British Industry's approach to the EU Social Chapter which, it will
be recalled, has been bitterly opposed by all the main UK employer
organisations.
This was certainly the impression given to The Herald yesterday by the
new director-general, Adair Turner.
It could be, of course, that the possibility, not to say probability,
of a Labour government in the near future which supports the Chapter is
an influencing factor.
The CBI is after all a realistic organisation but, in addition, a
number of its own large companies are already adopting some of the
measures, particularly those with extensive business interests in the
EU.
Mr Turner made it clear that while the CBI had supported the
Government's opt out, it did not object to specific measures but the
blanket acceptance of whatever comes up.
The CBI itself is endeavouring to play a role in influencing
legislators to take account of business competitiveness when formulating
their plans in Brussels. But he emphasised that the CBI was by no means
totally opposed to all the proposals and others it would just like to be
toned down.
The Labour Party had shown elements of flexibility and is not unaware
of the importance of industry being competitive. Certainly the CBI
director-general has no worries about being marginalised under new
government of a different hue.
That, after all, had been the case even under the Tories before the
ERM fiasco in September, 1992 which considerably raised the CBI's
profile in terms of advice for a humilated Government.

CAPITAL Copiers founder and managing director, Tom Flockhart, has
always believed in the need to stay in the forefront of office equipment
technology. That is one of the reasons why he will leave on another trip
to Japan next month, visiting factories and meeting Japanese
manufacturers, keeping up-to-date with developments.
''I owe that to our customers,'' he said in his office in Glasgow.
''Business equipment technology is expanding very quickly in many
sectors of the market, along with the technical quality of equipment.''
Quality and service have been his two priorities since he founded
Capital Copiers in l979 after many years experience in office equipment
sales.
What began as a small concern has built up to today's #10m-a-year
turnover company with its Scottish and independent status proudly
intact.
''When I was first involved in office technology some 25 years ago
there was little more than basic copying equipment available in the
average office,'' he said. ''But there has been a positive explosion in
technology -- one that continues with the start of the digital age,''
said sales manager Bill Burns, who typically began his career with the
company as a junior salesman in l988.
''I came into the business equipment world at the same time as a
postal strike helped significantly boost the sale of fax machines. At
that time most machines used thermal paper but improving technology has
meant continuing growth through the introduction of plain paper
machines,'' he said. ''Our service to customers includes making them
aware of new technology and how it can help them in their business.
''Our approach has always been to invite people to sit down with us,
to invite them to tell us what they want to achieve, and then to offer
them the best advice we can.''
All equipment is supplied and installed by Capital Copiers with
operator training and instruction provided where necessary. After-sales
service is combined with a fully computerised Field Service System.
''Our average response time to breakdown calls throughout Central
Scotland is under four hours,'' said Glasgow service manager Brian
Hamilton. ''At present 98% of all breakdown calls are answered within
four hours.''
Capital Copiers hold Investors in People status and have achieved both
BS 5750 and ISO 9002 quality accreditation for service. Achievement
plaques awarded by several international companies are ranged around
their walls.
''Our philosophy since day one has been that the greatest strength of
our company is employing sound, professional, and ethical people who
represent our company and our products honestly and properly,'' said Tom
Flockhart.
''High ethical standards and in-depth knowledge are particularly
important in the world of office equipment, where customers have to know
they can rely on us -- that is how we earn our livelihood.''
Keeping abreast of the changing world of office equipment, more than
ever before designed for multi-task purposes, leaves him not too much
time for his off-duty interest in the world of motorcycle sport.
The trip to Japan next month follows on a long list of other business
expeditions which have regularly taken him to the Far East, to European
exhibitions, and to the United States -- one US visit was to attend an
international conference of office equipment dealers.
''The bottom line, however, is that our business has been built on our
reputation for providing the very best after-sales service in the
industry,'' he said. ''We are professionals.'' It is a business which is
continuing to grow, as Capital Copiers has recently opened a new sales
and service centre at Glenrothes in Fife.
At the Wellington Street showroom, the Glasgow base since l989 after
an earlier presence in Cadogan Street, sales manager Bill Burns agrees
that their range and choice of products is steadily expanding from the
core business of black-and-white photocopiers. I believe, however, many
offices still have to discover the real value in having quality,
productive equipment.''
''Next week's The Missing Link exhibition may show many of the people
who come along exactly how that might be achieved.''
''They can learn about integrated systems, and about multifunctional
copiers which can operate within a computer network as a copier, scanner
and printer.
''In some instances, many time-consuming and costly intermediate steps
can be done away with altogether, and work can be produced quickly and
efficiently on the copying system. Colour copiers can help create
in-house images on to disc for printing purposes.
''When it comes to choosing the right equipment to make that possible,
we believe that our sales and service staff have a depth of experience
and commitment which is recognised as being among the best in our
industry.''
At next week's exhibition Capital Copiers will demonstrate that to
every interested visitor.

Robert MacLeod reports from a business which is opening its doors to
those who require smooth-running systems.
GLASGOW'S business community have a unique opportunity to view a
selection of some of the most advanced office equipment technology now
available. A three-day exhibition in the showroom of Capital Copiers in
Wellington Street next week, will feature a number of machines being
shown together for the first time.
''We have called this exhibition 'The Missing Link','' said Tom
Flockhart, managing director and founder of Capital Copiers, a company
which has gained an enviable reputation for service and quality. The
company is regarded as one of the UK's leading independent office
equipment suppliers. ''We can now offer customers a wider range of
choice than ever before.
''This exhibition both underlines that fact and explains to Glasgow
business people the many truly exciting ways in which office equipment
technology has developed and expanded. Using the latest equipment, such
as the ranges on display next week, any office, whatever its size, can
have the ability to do much more than ever before, and do it all
in-house, in ways that would not have been thought possible only a short
time ago. We are inviting people to come and see for themselves.''
Located at Apsley House, Wellington Street, in the heart of the city's
business sector, the Capital Copiers sales and service centre for
Glasgow occupies the modern, open-plan ground floor area of 45OO sq ft.
The regular showroom displays are being joined by many first-time items,
emphasising the fact that as an independent supplier the firm can offer
the widest possible choice from top-quality brands.
The exhibition will be open from 10am until 6pm on Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday of next week. Invitations have been sent out to businesses
throughout the Greater Glasgow area. A buffet with wine and coffee will
be available each day.
''We have been delighted by the number of long-established customers
who have contacted us to say they will most certainly be along,'' said
Tom Flockhart. ''Throughout our business history we have always attached
a particular importance to the way in which our customers, whether old
or new accounts, stay loyal to us. In fact, we are proud to say 'once a
customer, always a customer' -- and of the way in which we have seen
many of these firms grow in the same way we have over the years.''
Capital Copiers, which now has an annual turnover of #10m, covers all
of Central Scotland with a staff of l54; 20 of whom are based in Apsley
House. The experienced sales and service team who will be in attendance
at the exhibition, include many long-service employees who have honed
their skills in electronic office equipment knowledge through regular
courses run by Capital's own training department and by secondment to
training courses run by suppliers.
''Next week's exhibition is intended to provide anyone with a chance
to view the latest office technology and at the same time offer them
sound professional advice on the equipment best suited to their specific
needs,'' said Bill Burns, the Glasgow branch sales manager.
''We can back our equipment with an after-sales service on new or
fully reconditioned equipment that is the best in the business.''
Digital technology -- the latest phase in the world of office equipment
-- makes its appearance in some of the items on display. Emphasising the
way in which Capital Copiers has expanded its product range, the
exhibition will feature equipment from some of the world's leading
manufacturers including Riso, Sharp, and Canon side by side with Oce,
NEC, and Apple Macintosh.

HUNTING, the aviation, defence and oil group, reported higher turnover
and profits in the first half of the year.
There were improved results from the aviation and oil divisions and
maintained profits in the defence division. Prospects are said to be
encouraging in all three areas.
On a divisional basis, the defence business enjoyed an increased
contribution from the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) management
contract. Hunting Engineering successfully continued its involvement in
the European Consortium's Multiple Launch Rocket System, the contract
for which is due for completion later in the year. The Irvin companies'
results were at a similar level to those of 1994.
Hunting Oilfield Services was well ahead of its 1994 result, helped by
a contribution from the Hydra-Lok acquisition. Smaller subsidiaries
experienced mixed fortunes but are expected to perform better in the
second half.
The aviation business benefited from a lower cost base and increased
level of business. However, margins continue to be under intense
pressure in Aircraft Engineering.
Gearing at 57% was similar to last year and is not expected to vary
significantly in the second half of the year. Capital expenditure was
#10.7m compared with #7.2m previously.
Hunting's shares gained 7p to 219p.

ONE of the latest products to be seen at the Capital Copiers
exhibition is an example of the new Risograph digital duplicator, backed
by other examples of the Riso range of models designed to suit virtually
every budget or requirement.
''Riso was the first duplicator manufacturer in the world to create an
'intelligent' machine through micro processor control,'' said Brian
Hamilton, Capital Copiers' Glasgow service manager.
''Their latest products are specifically designed to produce anything
from a few copies to thousands at the touch of a button and can save as
much as 80% on copying costs.
''Many models can be interfaced direct with some computers for direct
output and Riso can also offer a choice of eight colours plus black.''
The Risograph, with an established reputation for being very simple to
deal with and not requiring a skilled operator, has also gained an
equally valuable reputation as being built to last and requiring low
maintenance -- both important factors in any modern office environment.
''In performance terms it can print at a speed of l3O copies a minute
-- which works out at a startling 7800 an hour,'' said Brian Hamilton.
From the latest in copiers, colour laser copiers and large format
copiers to faxes and digital printers, the aptly named The Missing Link
exhibition includes electronic storage and retrieval systems to
computers and full colour laser writers.
''We believe that many firms, particularly small businesses, will be
genuinely surprised at the way in which the latest techology, is
steadily making it easier for them to produce more in-house documents,''
said Bill Burns.
''People are looking for the best value for money. Capital Copiers
provide it -- and we'll be delighted to prove it.''

Washington, Wednesday -- The government's main economic forecasting
gauge rose modestly in August, partly because of stronger manufacturing
activity, the Commerce Department said today.
The Index of Leading Indicators, which is supposed to forecast
economic trends six to nine months ahead, rose 0.2% after a 0.2%
decrease in July. The index has risen in two of the past three months,
suggesting a firmer underlying tone of economic activity after a weak
second quarter.
The index measures a basket of economic indicators ranging from
unemployment benefit claims to building permits. Eight of its 11
components strengthened in August while three were weaker.
The department announced last month that it was turning over the
leading indicators report to the private Conference Board, which
assisted in preparing the August report.
The leading indicators in August were led by higher orders for
manufactured consumer goods and by fewer claims for unemployment
insurance.
In addition, the money supply rose, the average workweek was longer,
and plant and equipment orders increased. There were more applications
for building permits, higher stock prices and increased order backlogs
at manufacturing plants.
The negative indicators were led by lower commodity prices. Vendor
deliveries were swifter and consumer expectations weakened from July.
The leading index has strengthened in only two of eight months this
year -- during June and August. It was flat in January and then declined
for four straight months from February to May before June's 0.2% rise.
The economy went through a weak period in the second quarter this year
but has shown signs of more vigour during the third quarter, with
increased orders for manufactured durable goods and a pickup in housing
activity in response to lower interest rates. -- Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Burn Stewart hit by higher charges. Scotch Whisky group sees little prospect of prices improving in the near future.</HEADLINE>

HIGHER interest charges chipped away at the profits of Burn Stewart
Distillers last year as whisky prices remained in the doldrums.
Sales of bottled whisky rose 8.5% during the year ended July 2, but
the small independent distiller found it impossible to raise prices due
to intense competition.
A #400,000 increase in interest charges was, therefore, instrumental
in reducing pre-tax profits to #4.0m from #4.2m.
Burn Stewart was forced to dip into reserves to keep its full-year
dividend unchanged at 5p and its shares fell 2p to 134p.
Managing director Ian Bankier said there was little prospect of whisky
prices improving in the near future.
But he noted that a series of recent top-level appointments in the
whisky industry could lead some major distillers to stop discounting, a
move that would boost prices in the medium term.
''It is totally unsustainable for the industry to go on selling whisky
at the prices it is charging at the moment,'' Mr Bankier said.
''The solution to this problem is in the hands of the industry. No
external factors are going to make the price go up,'' he added.
Alan Gray, a whisky analyst with Sutherland Partners in Edinburgh,
said he was watching with interest the approach that Kenneth Hitchcock,
the recently appointed boss of Whyte &amp; Mackay, would adopt.
But neither Mr Gray nor Mr Bankier saw any upturn in whisky prices
before the beginning of 1996.
Burn Stewart hopes to achieve higher sales growth in the current
financial year, but Mr Bankier said any improvement in profit margins
would only come as a result of higher volume sales in the lucrative Far
East market.
Burn Stewart is based at Barrhead on the southern outskirts of Glasgow
and owns malt distilleries at Tobermory on Mull and Deanston in
Perthshire.
Sales growth last year came mainly from the UK, where it supplies
own-label brands to supermarkets, the Far East, where it has a
particularly strong presence in Taiwan, and South Africa.
During the current year Mr Bankier is hoping for strong sales growth
in France, where Burn Stewart recently changed its distributor, and the
emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.
Debt gearing increased to 96% last year from 74% as the company
increased its net borrowings by #7.7m to #34.4 to finance the purchase
of matured whiskies.
But Mr Bankier said he did not anticipate any further increase in
borrowing during the current year.
Mr Gray at Sutherland Partners said Burn Stewart had turned in ''quite
a creditable result in the circumstances''.
But he expressed concern at the high level of gearing, which is well
above the industry average, and a 7% increase in costs last year.
The analyst said there was little prospect of Burn Stewart improving
its performance until whisky prices began to improve.
''They will just continue to tread water until there is a significant
increase in prices,'' he said.
However, Mr Gray does expect a ''gentle upturn'' in prices in 1996 and
is pencilling in a rise in Burn Stewart pre-tax profits to #4.5m in the
current financial year.

BLACKFACE sheep breeders from the South-west enjoyed a generally
animated trade yesterday in Newton Stewart when the shearlings were
presented on the first day of the annual two-day sale of rams. When
Graham McClymont of Cuil, Newton Stewart, came into the ring auctioneer
Jim Craig was hard pressed to keep up with the flurry of bids, so
anxious were the top breeders to secure sheep from this leading flock.
The first from Cuil sold for #35,000 to Ian Bond, Glen, Gatehouse, but
the next was even better, going for #36,000 to Michael Scott, Trolows,
Elvanfoot. A full brother then sold for #10,000 in a joint deal to John
Harkin, Loughlash, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, and Tom Renwick &amp;
Son, Blackhouse, Yarrow, Selkirk. The McClymont pen totalled just over
#110,000 for 27 animals.
Gavin Campbell from Larg of Creetown, another leading regular
consigner, was next to hit a rich vein when his best sold at #18,000 to
Jim and Andrew Kay, Gass, Straiton, with another going at #5000 to Will
Barrie, Cambret, Gatehouse. Gass in due course enjoyed a great trade
peaking at #4500 to Brig.
The general summary of the trade was that after a sharp beginning
buyers were looking for sheep with size and confirmation. However, as
time went on it was evident that, in spite of the high prices, many
lacked those qualities. One leading breeder said: ''Too many of the best
sheep have gone out of this district in recent years and we are missing
them.''
Leading flock averages: Cuil (27) top #36,000, average #4113. Larg
(24) top #18,000, average #1507. Beoch (21) top #8000, average #957.
Drannandow (27) top #9000, average #721. Craig (20) top #5500, average
#887. Blackcraig (15) top #8000, average #1721. Barhaskine (18) top
#12,000, average #1071. Grimmet (16) top #3400, average #901. Overall
676 rams averaged #683.03 -- up #108.01. Auctioneer was James Craig.

SCOTLAND has the potential to create for itself the best environment
in the world, Professor William Turmeau, chairman-designate of the
Scottish Environment Protection Agency, said yesterday.
''That would be the goal I would set for the agency,'' he told the
Scottish Fish Farming conference at Aviemore. ''Today our environment is
good -- there is no reason why we should not have the highest
environmental quality in the world by any standard. That would be a
tremendous flag to fly. It would attract attention and wealth to the
country for business and industry.''
Professor Turmeau said that when the agency came into being next April
a major theme of its activites would be sustainable development. It
would also want to take account of local needs. Scotland was a country
of diverse areas each with their own special concerns to which SEPA
would want to pay regard.
In the more distant future, he forecast that public opinion would
force industry and business to take account of environmental interests.
A recent survey had shown that 64% of the public considered protection
of the environment more important than keeping prices down, and 95% said
we must be prepared to make sacrifices now to ensure future generations
could meet their needs.
''The customer will be so environment-conscious that industry will
have to comply to stay in business,'' he said. ''Anyone who does not act
responsibly will alienate their customers and damage their own
product.''
Professor Michael Usher, chief scientific adviser to Scottish Natural
Heritage, in an address to the conference, proposed that one way to
combat raids on fish farms by herons, gulls and cormorants would be to
encourage the re-introduction of the white-tailed eagle which would
frighten off such predators.
One questioner suggested such a policy would be unpopular with sheep
farmers, but Professor Usher said Norwegian experience was that sea
eagles rarely went for lambs. Germany and Sweden were both encouraging
growth of the sea eagle population. In Norway their numbers had grown
from 400 at the end of the Second World War to 15,000 today. ''It is
very much valued as a species by communities where it exists,'' he said.
One area of concern to both fish farmers and Scottish Natural Heritage
was the escape of farmed stock, he said. To the industry any loss was an
ecomonic one. From the scientific point of view, there was considerable
concern about the effects of interbreeding, especially in the case of
salmon where it might affect their ability to return to the same river.
Dr Alan Munro of the Scottish Office Marine Laboratory at Aberdeen
told the conference that investigations into last year's outbreak of
viral haemorrhagic septicaemia -- VHS -- at a fish farm on Gigha had
shown the virus existed in cod and haddock caught east off Shetland.
It was also known that turbot on Gigha had on occasion been fed from
frozen blocks of small haddock bought on the Peterhead market. There was
also one previous report of VHS in North Sea cod in 1979.
''It is concluded that there are marine reservoirs of VHS virus but
further investigation is required to establish how common they are,'' he
said.

THE Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which includes all the main
lending bodies, is calling for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take
action in his Budget to revive the housing market, adding its collective
voice to that of building societies such as the Halifax and the
Nationwide. Members of the hard-pressed construction industry have also
requested action.
The CML, in its submission, is asking the Chancellor to abolish the
housing transaction tax, stamp duty, and to provide additional help to
first-time buyers.
It said that after a modest recovery in house prices and transactions
between 1992 and 1994, the full force of recession hit the housing
market again in 1995. Uncertainty over jobs, interest rates, house
prices and, not least, Government policy, have all deterred potential
purchasers.
It believes, though, that recent action by lenders has removed, for
the time being, concerns about higher mortgage rates, and the Government
should build on this development.
Abolishing stamp duty on house purchase is the option favoured by the
CML, but others include an increase in the availability of tax relief on
mortgage interest. This would entail a reversal of the previous
reduction in the Miras rate from 20% to 15% -- at a cost of around
#1000m.
The CML said these measures would be administratively straightforward
and represent a clear signal that the Government remained sensitive to
developments in the owner-occupied market.
However, it also said there was a case for examining more complex
schemes, such as those that might give additional tax relief to
first-time buyers, which it also favours after stamp duty abolition,
leaving the current tax relief arrangements for existing owner-occupiers
unchanged.
The timing of the restriction on income support for mortgage interest
which came into effect at the beginning of this month could not have
been worse, the council said.
With only about 10% of all mortgage borrowers having private sector
insurance in place, the changes will heighten the degree of insecurity
created by labour market uncertainty.
Current Government policy means that there are substantially greater
benefits available to low-income and unemployed tenants than there are
to similarly placed owner-occupiers.
''Given that the Government has an explicit policy of promoting the
growth of owner occupation, it seems odd that it should pursue entirely
contrary policies in relation to lower income groups,'' though it
regards an examination of the different benefits available to owners and
tenants, and the need for them to be equalised, as a longer term
project.

A COMBINATION of poor women's wear sales and higher advertising spend
took its toll on Austin Reed's first-half performance.
Profits were 22% lower at #1.4m although sales were up on the same
period last year. However, the interim dividend was held at 2p.
In the words of Chris Thomson, Austin Reed's finance director, the
company ''lost out all round''. An attempt to broaden the women's wear
customer base with more unstructured casual clothes in the range
flopped. Not only were new customers not enticed to buy the merchandise,
but Austin Reed's traditional clientele -- senior businesswomen -- were
alienated.
Serious markdowns had to be made to shift the merchandise which
adversely affected margins. This at a time when first-half expenditure
on advertising was increased by #200,000 to #1.1m.
Austin Reed was one of the first retailers to market a range
specifically at career women. For 15 years this has proved popular,
accounting for 20% of the group's business. Action has been taken to
improve the situation.
A new head of women's wear has been appointed from rival Aquascutum.
Elsewhere in the group, the manufacturing division performed well with
both sales and profits improving. Its hand-tailored brand, Chester
Barrie, enjoyed increased business from the US, and the Stephens
Brothers shirt factory also saw healthy demand.
Improvements in the efficiency of its factories are expected to bear
fruit next year in terms of more competitive pricing on the back of
larger volumes. No major job losses are anticipated.
During the first half new outlets were opened on London's Strand and
at Heathrow Airport's Teminal One. Negotiations are continuing on two
further potential sites. There are no plans to add to its existing four
stores in Scotland.
Mr Thomson said he was looking forward to women's wear performing
significantly better next year, but in the meantime the group remains
cautious about overall trading for the remainder of this year.
Austin Reed shares lost 3p to 192p.

SCOTTISHPOWER has dramatically stepped up its campaign to persuade
Manweb shareholders to accept its hostile takeover bid, mounting a
television advertising push with just two days to go till the deadline
for its offer.
The Glasgow-based electricity company must acquire or secure
acceptances for at least 50% of the shares of the English electricity
company by lunchtime tomorrow or its #1100m bid will lapse.
It was back in the open market again yesterday, buying a further 5.3
million Manweb shares at 990p to boost its total stake in the
Chester-based company to 26.2%.
ScottishPower has already secured acceptances for a further 6% of
Manweb shares from shareholders who have expressed a willingness to
accept the terms of its bid, boosting its effective level of control to
about 32%.
But as the deadline approaches, it is pulling out all the stops.
A spokesman for ScottishPower said the company has bought prime time
advertising space on both Granada and HTV -- the two independent
television stations received by Manweb customers in Merseyside and North
Wales.
The adverts, in both English and Welsh, were rushed through the
production process at top speed. They spell out ScottishPower's
cash-plus-shares offer, currently worth 1003p, and its all-cash
alternative of 990p and how to go about accepting the deal.

DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIALS
GRAMPIAN Holdings had an attentive audience of analysts yesterday when
it scored a world first by presenting its half-time figures on a floppy
disk. This may replace the conventional printed statements and prove
invaluable for more detailed analysis of the figures.
These showed transport activities are the fastest growing element in
the Grampian range of activities. At the half-way stage, they managed a
42% increase in profits and the outlook for the medium term seems to be
one of further encouragement.
The group's operations are concentrating more on disposal of dry waste
such as rubble -- and to this end a quarry five miles west of Glasgow
Airport has recently been acquired which will take spoil for the next
decade as well as providing a side income from reclamation.
Grampian's Malcolm subsidiary is also extending its warehousing and
distribution business into England with a depot at Warrington. It is the
largest distributor of glass bottles for the whisky industry.
The divisional activity helped push overall group pre-tax profits
ahead by 19% to #4.29m.
Pharmaceuticals had a tougher time.
There were setbacks in Australia and New Zealand because of marketing
expenses and licences being withdrawn in Germany which benefited the
preceding year.
Although profits were down 14% to #2.62m, chairman Bill Hughes is
highly optimistic about a product to control sea lice for salmon.
Grampian has gained a huge marketing advantage by providing emergency
supplies to fish farms in Maine even before full Food and Drug
Administration authorisation.
Long-term prospects look good because fish farming will have to
increase worldwide as there is little white fish left anywhere.
Although with a high turnover of #12.4m, the sporting goods business
made an insignificant profit of #23,000 and will do better in the
current half after the European victory in the Ryder Cup.
This is a sensitive area for Grampian which has spent #8m on the
Patrick boots subsidiary in France over the years before its sale and
although these losses will eventually be made up through royalty income.
It is hoped the 20%-owned Edinburgh Woollen Mills will be floated in
perhaps eight months time which would bring in about #20m-#25m to
Grampian.
The interim dividend had been raised marginally to 1.8p.
Grampian shares firmed 5p to 149p.

A MAJOR reorganisation of Blenheim's core exhibition business over the
past 18 months is yielding results, the group said yesterday.
''We are currently trading in line with budget and expect
progressively to see the effects of our actions in the last part of this
year and over the following two years,'' said chairman Neville Buch.
He emphasised that the company was concentrating on boosting revenue
from its existing businesses now that the cost-reduction programme begun
18 months ago had largely been completed.
During that time it has slimmed down its exhibition businesses through
a series of disposals and licensing arrangements and increasing use of
joint ventures.
''Profits for 1995 will be heavily second-half weighted,'' said Mr
Buch. ''Management action taken over the past 18 months, coupled with
improving trading environments, is beginning to yield results.''
Taxable profits in the six months to the end of June fell to #13.1m,
after write-offs of #2.1m, from #19.2m in the first half of 1994.
Turnover was down to #92.1m from #99.7m.
Shareholders will receive a maintained interim dividend of 3.5p on
earnings per share of 6.1p against 10.8p.

NEILL Clerk Group, which specialises in introducing smaller companies
to the Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM), has nearly
tripled its profits in the six months to September 30.
The Glasgow and London-based financial services company said its
pre-tax profits soared to #307,000 from #120,000, reflecting its success
in generating good quality fee-earning business.
The board celebrated by doubling the interim dividend to 4p from the
equivalent of 2p last time.
Neill Clerk said its residential property unit trusts continued to
provide a good exit route for people who had invested in small companies
under the Business Expansion Scheme.
These trusts acquired three BES companies during the half year, and
chairman Sir Robin Duthie said the purchase of a further two BES
companies was imminent.
Neill Clerk, which launched its own shares on the AIM in July, has so
far introduced 13 companies to this section of the stock market and sees
more candidates in the pipeline.
The AIM, launched in June, offers companies greater share liquidity
than the sluggish rule 4.2 market, which was wound up last month.
Sir Robin predicted that Neill Clerk would continue to perform
strongly in the second half of the year. ''I look forward to the
remainder of the year with confidence as the second half of our
financial year is usually busier than the first half,'' he said.
The results announcement coincided with an extraordinary meeting which
approved a five-for-one share split. This raises Neill Clerk's issued
capital to just over 2.5 million shares of 2p each.
The company's shares -- still trading at their pre-split rate -- rose
105p to 1250p.

<HEADLINE>Bank of Scotland profits up by 23%. Investment in new systems and branch refurbishment creates big increase in operating costs.</HEADLINE>

BANK of Scotland yesterday defended the 16% increase in operating
costs which took the shine off its interim figures and disappointed the
City.
The rise in costs was the result of aggressive investment by the bank,
in its fight for business in a dog-eat-dog UK market-place.
Looking overseas, Bank of Scotland reiterated its high hopes for the
Australian bank it is purchasing.
Interim pre-tax profits rose 23%, from #213m to #262m, although the
bulk of this increase was down to a #32.8m cut in the bad and doubtful
debt charge to #85.8m.
Stripping out the impact of bad debt provisioning, operating profits
were up only 6% at #340m, with some of this increase the result of
one-off considerations.
The dividend for the six months to end-August is up 15% at 2.45p.
The rise in Bank of Scotland's operating costs, from #296m in the
first half of last year to #343m, was a consequence of investment in new
systems and a major branch refurbishment programme. The bank also put
more resources into its Chester-based instalment credit subsidiary NWS
Bank.
However, treasurer and chief general manager Peter Burt believes the
expensive move to modern open-plan branches, like the new-look branch in
Glasgow's Queen Street, is vital to the bank's continuing prosperity.
First-half costs at NWS were up about #20m at #65.8m. About half of
this increase was the result of an increase in employee numbers, with
promotional activities and new systems accounting for the remainder.
Mr Burt said: ''It is a big increase in costs and is of some concern.
''But the encouraging thing is that most of the expenditure is
directly related to increasing our business.''
Mortgage lending continues to be hard work, with the housing market
still in the doldrums and Bank of Scotland's interest rate margins under
severe pressure.
Greater pressure on margins in the medium-sized corporate sector is
also envisaged during the second-half.
The bank's first-half sterling lending was 3% higher at #16.3bn, in
spite of fierce competition and generally lethargic demand for
borrowing.
However, the state of the market was reflected in a fall in the net
interest margin from 2.88% in the second half of last year to 2.59%
during the six months to end-August.
At a meeting on Tuesday, Bank of Scotland's board was divided on
whether the UK economy had stopped for breath or was on the point of
decline, with the majority taking the optimistic view that there had
merely been a pause in growth.
During the six months, Bank of Scotland's key ''Tier 1'' capital
ratio, which dictates the amount it can lend, grew from 6.1% to a
healthier 6.6% as a result of a #111m Preference share issue.
It is anticipated that the ratio will fall back to about 6% as a
result of the #235m purchase of 51% of the Bank of Western Australia
(BankWest). However, it will still be well ahead of the international
requirement of 4% and the 5% level at which the Bank of England would
require remedial action.
Operating profits at the clearing bank itself, before provisions,
edged up to #246.7m from #235.1m. However, with a #23.6m gain on
disposal this time round overshadowing a #10.9m one-off gain in the
first half of last year, underlying operating profits at the clearing
bank were marginally lower.
The City, which cut Bank of Scotland shares by 7p to 240p after
yesterday's results, seems to have some reservations about the BankWest
purchase.
However, Mr Burt believes Western Australia will reap rich rewards
from the projected economic boom in South-east Asia.
He said: ''You have got to find the economic escalator that is going
up and leap on it.
''You are better off being incompetent in a growing economy than being
competent in a declining economy.''
Bank of Scotland Governor Sir Bruce Pattullo, accompanied by general
managers Robin Browning and Iain Scott, paid a ''courtesy call'' to
Perth-based BankWest last week.
Another general manager, George Mitchell, heads a Bank of Scotland
team which will be working with BankWest during the next few weeks.
Bank of Scotland expects to complete the purchase of 100% of the
Australian bank next month. It envisages the subsequent flotation of 49%
will be completed by its February 29 year-end.
Hugh Pye, banking analyst at broker BZW in London, is retaining his
''buy'' stance on the stock.
Although the increase in operating costs resulted in Bank of Scotland
falling #8m short of his interim pre-tax profit forecast, he is sticking
with his forecast of a 20% rise in full-year profits to #540m.
Perhaps in the minority, BZW was using yesterday's fall in the share
price as a buying opportunity.

HEWDEN STUART'S new chairman, Sandy Findlay, has started his tenure on
a cautionary note, warning that sales in the merchandising division have
been lower than expected in both August and September.
As a result, what is probably the world's biggest plant hire company
said that trading since July had been disappointing and below the
equivalent period of last year. Even so it is expected that full-year
taxable profits will exceed last year's total of #34.8m.
The shares dropped 9[1/2]p to 133[1/2]p although the remorseless
increase in dividends has continued with a rise in the interim payment
of 9.1% to 0.75p.
The figures for the six months to July were is line with forecasts,
advancing 22% to #19.7m on overall turnover 10.8% ahead at #142m.
Scotland, which accounts for roughly 20% of group business, saw a good
performance in the Central Belt, but Grampian continued to be weak
because of the lack of road maintenance programmes, something unlikely
to change so late in the year. There has also been weakness in offshore
demand for tool hire.
More positively, the recent acquisition of the Gamble &amp; Sadler crane
activities in the South of England may in time make a difference to
group profitability, particularly in the dynamic Heathrow area.
Hire rates are now flattening although they are still ahead of a year
ago.
Hewden Stuart continues to benefit from its policy of investing
heavily in new equipment. It spent #45m in the first half as the final
tranches of orders placed in the past, when suppliers were begging for
work, were delivered at old prices and on more advantageous sterling
terms than would be available now -- some were contracted before
Britain's escape from the ERM.
It is still gaining contracts from those seeking assured quality
plant, while also obtaining premium prices for secondhand equipment it
sells on, frequently abroad, and which accounts for up to 40% of overall
profits.
As a result of its expenditure gearing rose to 8%, but depreciation
and other cash flow are such that borrowings will be virtually nil by
the year end.
That is unless acquisitions are made. In the last week or two, three
crane hire companies have made approaches to see whether they could sell
out.
The silver lining to the cloud of uncertainty in the construction
industry is that Hewden Stuart can continue bottom trawling for cheap
acquisitions and that customers are hiring rather than buying.
Given the warning about current trading, full-year profits seem likely
to emerge at around #37m, leaving the shares selling at 14 times
possible earnings with a probable 2.8% yield.

ECONOMIC DATA
THE recovery in the Scottish and UK economies is continuing, but at a
lower rate of growth than last year, according to the latest quarterly
analysis from the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of
Strathclyde.
While the Scottish economy proved more resilient than the UK during
the recession and the earlier recovery phase, more recent evidence
points to a convergence in the two growth paths during 1994, the
institute said yesterday.
However, first-quarter output data from the production and
construction industries -- accounting for 36% of the overall Scottish
economy -- indicates the possibility that growth in Scotland's gross
domestic product might again outstrip UK GDP growth this year.
The growth areas in Scottish output are heavily export and investment
orientated. That, said the institute, might work to Scotland's relative
advantage. But it will take some time before we have any substantive
proof. The quarterly output figures are subject to heavy revision and
the Scottish GDP figures for 1993 were only published this summer.
The Fraser forecasters conceded that Scotland's recovery remains
relatively narrowly based. These first-quarter output figures were
dominated by a 23% rise in electronics output, compared with just 11% in
the UK as a whole.
Only three other Scottish sectors -- chemicals, drink and paper,
printing and publishing -- showed any positive growth in the first
quarter. In the UK as a whole, output growth in the same period was much
more widely based.
Having underperformed UK GDP growth for four successive years in the
late 1980s, overall Scotland's economy outperformed the UK from 1989 to
1992. In 1993 UK growth was just marginally below the 2.2% recorded in
Scotland.
The Fraser team said Scottish production and construction output data
for 1994 suggets that GDP growth again in Scotland fell below UK growth
last year. It will be another nine months before we know if they are
right.
The quarterly commentary noted that Scottish employees in employment
fell by 19,000 in the year to March, a period when Scottish registered
unemployment continued to fall.
''Net job creation is still a matter of some concern,'' said institute
director Brian Ashcroft.

THERE is no question that Scotland needs a better class of manager.
Was it only a couple of weeks back, indeed, that Edinburgh's Napier
University -- ''Investing in teaching and research to serve the
community'' -- was advertising its two-year ''open learning'' MBA to
people who need to know how to handle those tricky management decisions?
''Thought about an MBA . . . but cannot afford the time away from
work?'' the advertisement asked. An offer, surely, to suit the dozens of
part-time lecturers now being laid off by the university's management
who are about to acquire more spare time than they know what to do with?
The course, continued the ad, would ''allow you to develop your
management career without reducing your commitment to your job''.
Given that the lecturers are having their commitments abolished by
managers (doubtless MBAs to a suit) who seem to think the best way to
deal with a cash crisis in an educational establishment is to do less
educating, this seems a little beside the point.
The Diary thought to seek the opinions of a few departing lecturers,
but such is academic freedom these days they are forbidden even to speak
to the filthy press. This may be why Napier's journalism courses are so
very popular.
Eerie echo
A CHICKEN in every pot and a laptop on every lap: forward, software
permitting, with Labour! Actually, Tony Blair's ecstatic vision of a
wired Britain stirred a few memories among observers of American
politics. In the US, as here, the information superhighway has come to
be regarded by politicians who otherwise couldn't mend a plug as the
answer to each and every one of society's ills. Bandwagons are being
boarded left and right.
In an eerie anticipation of Blair's speech, in fact, one US sage also
called earlier this year for the distribution of laptops. Not stopping
at pupils, he was quoted in the New Yorker as arguing that the poor
could be ''enfranchised'' with microprocessors, modems, and spreadsheets
(presumably so they could keep tabs on precisely how poor they were).
Given that a half-decent machine will run you to a couple of thousand
pounds, this raised a few questions, ''How?'' being prominent among
them. Pressed, the normally loquacious visionary mumbled something about
vouchers, partnerships, and the need to anticipate tomorrow today. To
say he was mocked is to say nothing.
The name of the genius whose thinking in no sense influenced Mr
Blair's Brighton speech? Newt Gingrich, the socialists' sweetheart and
all-round good guy.
Junior jurors
NONE of which is to suggest that the inter-active age is to be sneered
at.
In Newt's homeland, Court TV, the firm responsible for bringing the
world wall-to-wall coverage of the O J Simpson trial, is readying the
audience of the future.
The company, as we understand it, intends to produce three new series
next spring ''aimed at helping kids between the ages of eight and 15
understand the American justice system''. Since this was more than most
British observers of O J's trial managed, we wish them luck.
Nevertheless, in a junior version of what has become part of the
American way of life, one of Court TV's proposed shows -- with ''on-line
participation'' -- will ''summarise real trials and analyse them from a
young person's vantage point''. Children in the studio will then
question a Court TV anchor and a guest expert -- presumably before
selling their stories to the supermarket tabloids.
And has the jury reached a verdict? ''Stop her pocket money!'' ''Tell
his faither!'' ''Skelp 'im!''
Swept away
TERRIBLE news from Inverness, where the Junior Chamber's annual
charity raft race has been cancelled. Organisers postponed the event
back in August for the good reason that the preposterous heat wave had
rendered the flow of the Ness too feeble. By last week -- but you
guessed -- the perverse river had become a foaming, dangerous torrent,
and too damned cold for man, beast, or daft raft.
The annual race is described locally as a tourist attraction.
Unlike, we can only suppose, the Inverness weather.
Heady ambitions
ON WHICH note: the North Argyll Forum has commissioned a draft
five-year plan from the Development Consultancy with a view to
regenerating the area.
With luck and hard work, say the authors, Oban could even become ''the
Inverness of the West''.
Now let's not get carried away here, people . . .
Lucky escape
STILL in the north, we note with dismay that five girl pupils at
Plockton High were sent home last week following allegations that they
had been found in possession of what may or may not have been drugs.
We might be wrong, but isn't Plockton the setting for the BBC's Hamish
MacBeth in which, famously, the PC was depicted as a bobby not averse to
an odd blaw of the waccy baccy? All in all, it's probably as well no-one
thought of filming Rab C Nesbitt up there.
To boldy scoff
BACK in Oban -- let no-one say we don't do our bit for regeneration --
sources suggest that news of Christmas has arrived early at the
Waterfront Restaurant. Plainly fed up with the same old religious
imagery and superstitious nonsense about visitors from beyond, the
establishment is offering a down-to-earth ''Starship Christmas'', the
menu for which has just been beamed down to us.
Thus you are free to boldly scoff where none has scoffed before with
the Warp Factor Pate, move on to Captain Kirk's Terrine, delight in
Scottie's Seafood Selection (with ''freshly stunned vegetables''), enjoy
O'Houra's Pudding, and round off the meal with Galactic Coffee and
''Clingon'' (surely ''Klingon''?) pies.
Traditional, or what? It's a laugh, Jim, but not as we know it.
Muckle-making
IRELAND'S Department of the Environment has just awarded #37,062 in
grants to Moneymore, in Donegal. First with the news, the Derry People &amp;
Donegal News states proudly: ''More Money for Moneymore''.
A terrible joke, reminiscent of another. Wee Leith joiner proudly sets
up his very own business. ''Is there money in it?'' asks a friend.
''Naw,'' reports the chippie, ''ah'm jist working ma'sel''.

THE scandalous rumours are quite untrue. Conservative Central Office
did not send a note to the jurors in the O J case asking them to bring
in their verdict in time to scupper Tony Blair's big moment. Mind you, I
do remember old Harold Wilson used to love creating diversions when the
Tory party conference was in full swing.
There are times in politics when you should at least attempt to be
generous. Mr Blair made a fine, passionate speech which obviously moved
and excited his party; it contained some self-deprecating humour which
is always a good idea.
He put forward one policy with which I strongly agree. If it is a
choice between a #600m identity card scheme or 3000 extra police on the
beat, mark me down for the latter.
Indeed, if Mr Ken Clarke is a bright boy he will just pinch this one
and say thanks very much.
Yet, although he certainly gained full marks for presentation, I did
find Tony's actual words a bit like a Chinese meal, grand at the time
but not exactly satisfying in the long-term. And the bill for all the
wonderful things he is proposing remains uncalculated.
You might care to believe that all school classes are to be reduced to
fewer than 30 pupils, that all kids are to have laptops, that all
five-year-olds are to be properly assessed, and that it is going to cost
not a penny more. There are fairies at the bottom of my garden, too.
It was perfectly fair of Alex Salmond and Michael Forsyth to point to
the scant reference -- 14 words -- to anything remotely Scottish. If
devolution is the flagship policy one would have to note that the banner
was kept well below deck.
I suspect Mr Blair believes Scotland is in the bag and prefers to
trawl for votes in the South-east of England. That might not be the
smartest decision he has ever made. There is a Scottish dimension and
you do not have to be in the SNP to recognise that fact.
In the cold light of day some of the splendid rhetoric also looks a
little silly. ''I want us to be a young country again. Young, with a
common purpose, with ideals we cherish and live up to.'' What does that
actually mean?
We have not been a young country since King Harold took one in the
eye, and I'm not quite sure how we are to shed thousands of years of
history. And what, apart from installing Tony in No 10, is the common
purpose?
But let us look at the beef, the policies which Mr Blair at last
allowed to be revealed. This will not take long.
The Assisted Places Scheme is to be abolished. Gosh that's exciting.
This is the scheme which allows children whose parents are of modest
means to attend some of our most distinguished schools. Sorry kids, the
new deal in education doesn't include you. What a piece of spiteful
dogma that represents.
No doubt we'll re-nationalise the railways. Well, I think they will.
Mr Blair steadfastly refuses to use these words.
''There will be a publicly owned and publicly accountable railway
system.'' Bought back at what cost? Can't say, won't say.
Mr Blair will take the excess profits of the privatised utilities and
use them to pay for a radical programme of work and education. How much
income can we expect?
Not known.
Presumably you can only tax the ''excess profits'' once; the windbag,
sorry windfall, tax cannot be a standard fixture. How are the great new
programmes to be financed thereafter? Pass.
The non-priced list grows ever longer. Crime is to be tackled,
democracy renewed, transport systems improved, single parents are to be
found jobs, action to be taken on drug abuse, a minimum wage to be
introduced, the health service given the opportunity to heal everybody
all the time, and we will, in the new Britain, be better off, each and
every one of us.
I would not like to sign Mr Blair's contract until he is ready to show
us more figures.
What the leader of the Opposition has done, and one should in fairness
recognise it, is thoroughly to dominate his party. It is amost
inconceivable to recall that Gordon Brown was the front runner at one
time to succeed John Smith.
Mr Brown has been eclipsed. His faltering performance at the
conference did not even rate a standing ovation and he appears to be
losing heart as well as ground. Gordon has never been quite the same
since he delivered that speech in financial gobbledegook.
So Mr Blair marches on, his internal critics silenced, his rivals
reeling. Yet he has still to come on in the big match.
Earlier this year there was much talk of how Labour hoped the Tories
would stick with John Major because he would be much easier to beat
than, say, Michael Heseltine. I do not hear so much of that now.
The Prime Minister, a much more difficult opponent than he often
appears, has been going about his business quietly but effectively
during the summer. The European sore is healing -- why even the Germans
are talking his language now.
Tory rebels are thin on the ground, the Cabinet reshuffle has worked
well, and the Budget is still to come. I suspect a smile passed across
Mr Major's face as he listened to Mr Blair's fine words. He will
certainly not be downhearted.
The state of the economy will be the prime factor which will influence
voters when election day comes. That day is still some time away and
much can still happen. And Mr Major can make it happen.
In this Parliament, so far, and in the country, Mr Blair has built up
a commanding lead. But, as Craig Brown has told me: ''It's a game of two
halves, Brian.''

Tom Gallagher reports how the car bomb which badly injured the
Macedonian President was intended to cause a collapse into more Balkan
bloodshed
THERE is a long list of suspects who may be responsible for the
attempt on the life of President Kiro Gligorov of Macedonia, but whoever
planted Tuesday's car bomb which left the 78-year-old seriously wounded,
their motives were simple: to eliminate a leader who, during four
difficult years, preserved the peace in his small Balkan state against
remarkable odds.
Macedonia is the most ethnically mixed part of ex-Yugoslavia after
Bosnia. It is shared by Macedonians, a south Slav people, and a large
Albanian minority. Many ethnic Macedonians fear that the Albanians,
(with one of the highest birth-rates in Europe) may one day outnumber
them and try to link up with Albania proper.
Restive Albanians feel that their rights to enjoy a state education in
their own language up to university level are withheld and that they are
second-class citizens in economic respects. These are the kinds of
quarrels over identity which, in other Balkan states where different
languages are spoken, have caused havoc and bloodshed.
But Macedonia has remained calm under Gligorov who has included
Albanians in his Cabinet, even persuading them to sit alongside
Macedonian nationalists.
Gligorov was one of the Yugoslav politicians who tried to prevent the
break-up of Yugoslavia after 1990. He was committed to the federal
project devised by Marshal Tito to keep ethnic rivalries in check.
Macedonia benefited from the dispersal of power by being made a republic
in its own right separate from Serbia which had dominated it before
1939. Gligorov, a partisan fighter, had risen to high office in Belgrade
where, in the post-Tito years he was sidelined by the hardliners and
careerists who wrecked Yugoslavia.
As Tito's dream was shattered by war, Macedonians and Albanians were
able to agree on one important thing; their interests were better served
by being outside the rump Yugoslav state which was Greater Serbia by
another name. Gligorov's Social Democratic Party prospered and he was
elected President in 1990.
He then showed himself to be just as wily as his predatory neighbour
President Milosevic by negotiating the peaceful withdrawal of the
Yugoslav army from Macedonian soil and foiling Serb bids to strangle
Macedonia at birth.
The biggest obstacle to Macedonia's survival has come from an
unexpected source. Greece objected to the state adopting a name held to
be at the heart of Greek cultural identity, and claimed that Skopje had
designs on its own northern province of Macedonia.
Since 1992 Athens has imposed an economic embargo on its neighbour
which has flattened living standards and produced the misery upon which
conflict thrives. Incredibly, other EU states have allowed Athens to
proceed with a policy which has destabilised Macedonia. In Douglas
Hurd's time as Foreign Secretary, Greece was given a free-run in its
bullying role, even though it ran the risk of spreading the Balkan
conflict to a new theatre. There has been persistent speculation that
Greece and Serbia plan to partition Macedonia between them, unguarded
remarks by a top Athens Minister in 1993 strengthening this view.
Washington intervened in the southern Balkans in 1993 to prevent a
Bosnia-style meltdown. American troops are there as part of the first
United Nations force to be despatched to a country before anticipated
conflict starts. Support has also come from President Chirac who in June
told the Greek Premier in no uncertain terms to end the boycott.
Greece finally did so two weeks ago, the damage to Athens' standing
abroad being seen to outweigh the benefits of playing to the nationalist
gallery at home.
Those most likely to be behind the Skopje bombing are extremist
Macedonians perhaps sponsored by Belgrade. Gligorov has recently
alienated some nationalists who want a tougher line against the
Albanians.
Gligorov's commitment to an ethnic sharing of power is a legacy from
the Tito era. If he succumbs to his wounds, Macedonia's bloody collapse
is likely to be much more rapid than Yugoslavia's was, because there is
simply no-one else who enjoys the same respect in all communities as
Gligorov.
This year's winner of the Golden Lion Prize at the Cannes Film
Festival, Before The Rain was set in a bleak corner of Macedonia, where
ethnically-divided neighbours pull out their guns to settle scores. The
film has stunning photography and a gripping story-line. But it received
a welter of criticism for transposing a Bosnia-style conflict to a land
still at peace. Perhaps it will now be viewed as prophetic.
Much hinges on the French neurosurgeons who were rushed to treat
Gligorov's wounds. If he recovers, his authority will be all the
greater. But if not, then a deluge of blood could sweep over a country
from which French chefs coined the culinary term Macedonian salad
because of the enormous diversity of its peoples and their customs.

WHEN I was 17 my chum Dave went along with me to a meet of the
International Socialists. When your family's always voted Labour, how
else are you supposed to rebel?
Armed with a close reading of Das Kapital -- well, OK, a flick through
on the bus -- and thrilled by the subversive feel of it, we plodded up
three flights of stairs in a high-tiled tenement in Marchmont.
The battered door with eight names on it opened a crack. Furtively we
thought. The cell was assembled in the pine kitchen amid coffee mugs,
socks that could have stood alone on any platform, and heaps of
homework.
Top Dog unfurled himself from the floor, cast us a furtive glance, we
thought, and began in a plummy voice, with long drawn-out vowels, the
ritual denunciation of the bourgeoise.
We were glad we'd come. It was the week they were doing a workers'
consciousness-raising session. Only the two of us had turned up to be
enlightened.
There was one very old man with a beret and egg stains on his tie,
three intense young men in combat jackets which we knew denoted
communism of the most extreme kind, a girl with greasy hair making a
meal of her nails, and Top Dog, whose mumblings were muffled a bit by
the long university scarf which we knew denoted his status as a
second-year sociology student.
There was a bit of a kerfuffle when Top Dog and the VOM fell out over
the correct Trotskyite analysis. Much flailing of arms and threatening
to punch the lights out of each other ensued among the comrades. Still,
we signed a couple of petitions and got out before the newspaper
sellers' duty roster came round.
I went home to explain to my mum, who had three low-paid part-time
jobs, about the international struggle for revolution. She just said
something like, ''That's nice hen, do you want a cup of tea?'' and went
back to working out how to stretch her wages to pay the rent and the
bills. It was tragic, really. Yes, the working class is a bit of a
disappointment.
So I decided to support Tony Benn instead. He seemed to know a thing
or two about downtrodden masses. Then, later, he berated me during a
rally in Leith Town Hall. Well not me personally, but it hurt. It was
all of us on the press bench, lackeys of the capitalist conspiracy, who
were entirely to blame for the failure of the rise of socialism,
apparently. I'd just finished handing out his leaflets too. Well,
really.
FURTHER brushes with radical left politics were never much of a
success. Years later my newly-divorced sister too was politicised and
went on a bus with a screech of feminists to a meeting in London. She
took her two-year-old. The workshop on Wages for Women was halted by a
trembling creche worker who announced to the collective that the meeting
couldn't go on. There was -- shudder, gasp -- a male in the building. My
sister rescued the conference by removing the enemy, her toddler son,
and took him off to Covent Garden, to stock up on Action Man outfits.
The reason that I've been thinking about all of this is that I'm
intrigued to know quite what is expected to happen if Labour doesn't win
the next General Election. Will the proletariat arise and demand a real
radical alternative?
Is it likely that a new political group will mass, that the workers
will lay down their laptops, nip out from their insecure, deregulated,
short-contract jobs, and the out-of-work arise from their enforced
morning slumbers?
Some sense a wind of change in the country crying out for true
socialism. I can't feel it. I sense dismay, at what's happened over the
past 15 years; yes, an instinctive gut feeling against a divisive
culture that devalues people and feeds off greed. And Blair? God help
us, he's berated for wanting to win. So much so, the critics snarl, he's
ditching all his principles.
Is there not more honesty here than in the long historical romance of
some of those on the left, with their intellectual agoraphobia and their
purity of principle, unsullied by practical problems, such as how to
begin to tackle real squalid poverty?
There is futility in opposition. There is even more futility among
those who claim that right now there is an alternative, unless I'm
mistaken and crowds of deregulated workers are flocking to join the
Socialist Workers' Party.
All those people who lead lives of tearing wretchedness and
deprivation have the cheek to want to escape their despair, and vote for
Blair. How politically incorrect. I tell you, the working class is such
a disappointment.

JAMES Freeman described some of the appalling incidents by speedboats
and jet-skis which are well-known to traditional users of Loch Lomond.
The comments by Ian Davis, chairman of Loch Lomond Waterskiers
Association, and by Mr Allan Alstead and Mr Jim Breen, chief executive
and deputy chief executive of the Scottish Sports Council, do not
inspire confidence that water and jet-skiers, and owners of high-powered
speedboats, have any sincere concern for other loch users.
The noise and vibrations propagated from high-powered boats are not
compatible with the conditions needed by wild creatures which were able
to survive in and on the shores of Loch Lomond before water and
jet-skiers domineered the loch.
In their quest for the excitement and thrill of speed these relatively
new loch users are oblivious to the wildlife which has a natural right
to live in this magnificent loch. Many people derive great pleasure from
studying, observing, and helping to protect the birds and animals which
are an important feature of this loch.
Mr Davis shows deep concern for young water-skiers who ''often feel
insecure and frightened far out from the shore'' and suggests reducing
the speed restricted area from 150 to 50m from the shore. He shows no
sympathetic feelings for the children (and their parents) who are
terrified that these fast boats will hit and kill them while they are
swimming in the loch.
Like canoeists, swimmers are hard to see in choppy water, especially
by a speedboat driver who is watching the waterskier. Does Mr Davis want
to restrict swimmers and canoeists to 50m from the shore?
I have had to order the children for whom I was responsible to stop
swimming in the loch as irresponsible waterskiers came far too close to
them. Indeed I have seen waterskiers pass at high speed within 20m of
the pier at Rowardennan. Children dive into the loch from this pier.
Mr Davis states that waterskiers are probably now the second biggest
user group of Loch Lomond. That is not surprising since water and
jet-skiers and owners of high-powered boats from all over the UK are
homing into Loch Lomond because sensible people are banning their use in
other inland lochs.
It is utterly unacceptable to allow a relatively small number of
selfish people to spoil the loch for large numbers of real sportsmen and
families who enjoy the natural beauty and peaceful environment. Those
who do not respect this beautiful loch should not be allowed to destroy
it.
The Scottish Sports Council has no right to say that it is objecting
on behalf of, not just waterskiing, but also other sports including
canoeists, yachtsmen, and anglers. Are there any canoeists, yachtsmen,
or anglers who support the Scottish Sports Council in its late
submission to the Scottish Office?
Mr Alstead and Mr Breen should devote more time, money, and effort to
helping schools like Abbotsford Primary in Gorbals to have a sports
playing field and less time for those whose activities disturb and
endanger the vast majority.
If their objections to the by-laws initiate a public inquiry, the
officials of this apparently class and politically biased quango should
use their own money to present their case, which primarily benefits
speedboat owners.
Mr Breen reveals his ignorance of angling by implying that a maximum
restriction of 11km per hour would effectively ban trollers. Experienced
fly fishers always row their boat out of the fishing area to deep water
before starting their outboard engine.
In my copy of the by-laws there is no mention of windsurfers. Mr Breen
is wrong in stating that windsurfers require to get their craft 150m
from the shore before commencing their sport.
Before water and jet-skiing it was not necessary to enforce
regulations on the large numbers of users of Loch Lomond. In the 1950s
dozens of boats fished the Endrick Bank without problems. Now we need
rangers to enforce regulations on Loch Lomond because of a small number
of inconsiderate loch users.
There have never been any serious complaints that people are disturbed
by canoeists, windsurfers, yachters, swimmers, anglers, nature-lovers,
etc. It would be much simpler and better to ban water and jet-skiing
completely and to limit the power rating of all individually owned
private boats, which must be registered.
This policy would save Loch Lomond and its natural habitat, benefit
real sportsmen and lovers of the loch, and help the tourist industry.

IT IS not surprising that delegates to the Liberal Democrat Conference
thought it was a shame that Glasgow neglects the Clyde.
But things are changing. The Clyde Maritime Trust is making good
progress with its Clydebuilt project to create a new Clyde maritime
heritage centre at Yorkhill Quay by the former Queen's Dock Pump House.
We already have the Clydebuilt barque Glenlee, which was launched at
Port Glasgow in December, 1896, moored at Yorkhill Quay and
pre-restoration work on the ship is nearing completion.
Glenlee is the only historic Clydebuilt sailing vessel still afloat
which can ever be permanently moored on the Clyde, because the four
others are in foreign museums.
Negotiations for site assembly are well in hand and capital funding
applications are being considered by the European Regional Development
Fund, the Heritage Lottery Fund, and the Glasgow Development Agency.
Our aim is to have Clydebuilt open to the public in May, 1997, and to
operate the centre thereafter without further recourse to public funds
with all operating costs covered by revenues from sales, services, and
admissions.
The progress which the trust has made over the last five years has
only been possible because of the tremendous support we have had from
Strathclyde Regional Council and Glasgow District Council, the European
Social Fund, the GDA, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Clydebuilt
plc, and many other firms and individuals, particularly those with real
maritime knowledge and experience who have worked voluntarily on the
Glenlee Restoration Project.
But something more is needed now. The city needs to recognise the
great asset it has in its maritime traditions, and not only to honour
its maritime past but also to carve out a share in the maritime future.
The Clyde still has more shipbuilding and maritime engineering than
any other river in the United Kingdom. The universities in Glasgow are
still a national centre of excellence for engineering. Business and
local government have shown that they can work together to make the most
of Glasgow's art and architecture.
All this can be brought together by using the maritime traditions of
the Clyde to focus Glasgow's self-image on a permanent basis, not for a
single year, but as a long-term strategy.

Chairman, Clyde Maritime Trust,

THE Scottish Office must now be moving dangerously close to bringing
its own credibility into question in its over-protracted attempt to find
a suitable form of words sufficient to allow the Sports Council to
extricate itself from the mess it now finds itself in as a result of its
ill-considered, precipitate response to the submission placed before it
by the Waterskiers' Association.
Sympathetic as attitudes might be towards the Scottish Office and the
imposed dilemma it now faces, consideration must nevertheless be shown
to those on Loch Lomond, both human and otherwise, at the sharp-end of
the consequences of such protracted deliberation..
Could an acceptable form of words perhaps be found such as to allow
implementation of these by-laws by the parks, subject to an assured
review after a period of one year, when the number of complaints
received relating to their unacceptability can be comprehensively
assessed by both the Scottish Office and Sports Council on an overall
loch-user basis?
This should prove acceptable to the majority while at the same time
going a long way toward burnishing the gravely tarnished reputation the
council has earned for itself.

RUTH Wishart's recent admirable programme on Radio Scotland about the
introduction of ''credit-bearing'' courses in the extramural classes of
Glasgow and other universities seemed to me to make it clear that this
is an entirely retrograde step.
My wife attended extramural classes at Glasgow University for
approximately 30 years, mainly in literature and art; in earlier years,
when she was bringing up a young family, these classes were almost her
only intellectual and artistic stimulus.
I myself, having spent a lifetime lecturing in mathematics, found
(both before and after retirement) that these classes, especially in
literature and history, broadened my horizons immensely. We both
attended for the sheer love of the subjects: we had neither the time nor
the desire to work for the attainment of some virtually useless
accreditation.
The letters of Martin Baillie (September 26) and Professor Leslie
(September 30) express far better than I can the merits of the existing
classes. From Ruth Wishart's programme I got the impression that there
is virtually no demand for these accredited courses from actual or
potential students, whereas the existing classes have flourished over
many years and continue to attract many students.
If, as I suspect, credit-bearing courses have been foisted from above
on the students (and on the universities) and if they squeeze out the
existing classes, the loss to the community will be immense.

In Escape from grip of fear, your Medical Correspondent Alan MacDermid
writes on a report of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (September 29).
His opening sentence reads, ''Medical science and common sense could
combine to save the lives of 70,000 cancer victims every year over the
next 25 years''. These optimistic figures, one assumes, are for the
United Kingdom.
Common sense tells my wife and me, who have both been close to
relatives who died after the most up-to-date scientific attempts to
eradicate their cancers, that such attempts are not dealing with the
fundamental cause of cancer, the body's failure to defend itself with
its immune system.
We have both read Dr Max Gerson's book, A Cancer Therapy -- the cure
of advanced cancer by diet therapy -- which was first published in 1958
after 30 years of clinical experimentation with his therapy.
We have also read other books on the Gerson treatment, which is aimed
at restoration of the body's healing mechanism, detoxification, the
natural function of all its organs, and the future maintenance of
health.
The successes of the Gerson therapy, especially in cancer cases deemed
hopeless and terminal by conventional medicine, appear dramatic and very
encouraging, but is it not common sense to use a therapy which builds up
the body's immune system (instead of destroying it with
chemo-''therapy''), and accelerates detoxification?
The Gerson therapy is for the whole body and not specifically for
cancer, so it effects healing from other chronic degenerative diseases
such as arthritis, tuberculosis, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis,
and diabetes. Old scars and adhesions are dissolved and allergies
eliminated.
Scientific medicine has made progress in all kinds of specialisations.
However it seems common sense to us to ask for investment in research
into the concepts which Dr Max Gerson practised, and which his
successors currently practise, with obvious success, in the face of
often vindictive opposition, at least in the USA, from the conventional
medical establishment.

SCOTTISH aspirations are being dealt a bitter blow by the ruling out
of rail electrification north of Edinburgh by Brian Burdsall, bidder for
a privatised InterCity East Coast line (interview by Iain Wilson,
September 27).
Investment to electrify and upgrade the Edinburgh-Dundee-Aberdeen
line, now recognised as part of the Trans European Network, would save
half an hour on current journey times, and help claw-back BR's
competitive edge, now losing out to mega road and motorway improvements.
The reference to a contractual obligation guarantee of through train
services to Aberdeen or Inverness is only a fragile political
convenience of the present. Future special case pleading over the
savings by focusing on a core network at Edinburgh, and a sub-contracted
deal with connecting ScotRail Sprinters will always be a powerful
temptation in the absence of electrification north of Edinburgh.
Scotland's pathetic 23% of its network improved by electrification
relegates major regional centres such as Dundee, Aberdeen, Stirling,
Perth and Inverness to the status of curiosity corners by their
isolation from a modern competitive railway which would be taken for
granted elsewhere in Europe.

ACCORDING to your leader, Paying lip service, atheists ''require the
face of an enemy to grind into the dust'' and they will therefore seize
upon the statement that Scotland is no longer a Christian country with
genuine delight (September 28).
I cannot speak for other atheists but I do not regard believers as my
enemies.
It is quite true that anti-religious polemic forms a considerable part
of freethinking and rationalist literature, but there is another side to
the non-religious life-stance -- especially for those of us who are
secular humanists -- and that is the promotion of a secular ethic which
often seems to me to be indistinguishable from the position adopted by
liberally minded believers from all the major religions.
Any of your readers who listen to Thought for the Day will often hear
a message which contains no explicit religious content at all but only
speakers who have a religious association will be asked to contribute to
the programme, so anyone can have a platform to advocate a humaninist
message -- except for self-confessed humanists.
The notion that all ethics and morality must depend on some faith in
the supernatural is manifestly absurd. The Scottish Church Census shows
that more and more Scots try to live a ''good and decent life'' using
only their own human resources, and an earlier report from the EC showed
that most Western European countries are following the same trend.

MURRAY Ritchie expresses concern on the difficulty of exchanging Scots
banknotes in continental Europe (October 2). I encountered the same
difficulty at Heathrow, England.
I asked an exchange agent to change Scots into English only to be
advised that it was impossible. I would have preferred the option of 6p
in the #1 or that of the retailer who refuses to change for parking
meters.
The only currency one cannot exchange for English at Heathrow is
Scots. Why should we expect our EC friends to be different?
I opted for the downtrodden minority sympathy approach and explained
the difficulty of hiring a taxi without local currency. As a special
favour and an exception I was eventually allowed to change #10.
Third World countries have long profited from exchanging their
currency for ours and then making it impossible to change back. Can one
conclude from Murray Ritchie's experience and the presence of Scottish
bankers that Scottish banks benefit from issuing notes that are never
re-exchanged? Bankers are not noted for sentiment so there has to be
some commercial reason for the extra expense and inconvenience.
There is little doubt if we were to pursue a course towards
independence, separate currency, and Third World status, making it
difficult for others to exchange Scots currency would create a new
financial services profit centre.

JUDGE Roger Sanders is not widely known, but he deserves to be. On the
evidence of his anger at the manner in which the English tabloid press
has reported the case against Mr Geoffrey Knights he appears to have a
greater grasp of the law of contempt than the Attorney General. The case
concerns the assault charges brought against Mr Knights who is the
father of a child born to a well-known television soap-opera actress.
Such people are the meat and drink of the tabloids and frequently they
are consumed entirely. The standards of reporting in this particular
case were so dreadful that Judge Sanders refused to proceed with the
case, deciding that the calumny piled on Mr Knights by the tabloids
meant that he had no chance of a fair trial. He directed that the papers
in the case should be sent to the Attorney General so he could consider
contempt proceedings against certain tabloid editors. This was followed
by news of a police investigation and gusts of justification from the
Attorney General's office, where the very notion that the Attorney had
failed to uphold the law was met with astonishment. The real source of
surprise is how Sir Nicholas Lyell has retained his post after allowing
the tabloids to abuse the law in such spectacular fashion.
This is of great interest to us in Scotland because the law of
contempt is similar. Those same tabloids circulate in Scotland with a
smear of Scottish news as justification for their existence here.
Thankfully the position of the Scottish Bench is more robust that its
English counterpart. In Scotland the law of contempt is upheld rigidly,
both as it is written and in faithfulness to the spirit which it
enshrines. Prejudicial material must not be published and nor may the
publication of pictures muddy the issue of identification. The Scottish
press may chafe against the most rigid application of these rules at
times but they are accepted willingly because something greater is at
stake: that is the right of every accused to a fair trial. This
principle has been forgotten by the Attorney General and appears never
to have been learned by certain journalists.

. . . in your ear, Michael: bridges. What a good idea to get that nice
wee lad from Kintail to open the Skye Bridge for you later in the month.
They won't dare fling brickbats at him, even if he is a Campbell, and
you can always stand alongside him and guide the scissors, you being
quite good at cuts. Don't worry about the threat of a boycott, either.
The place isn't exactly like Piccadilly Circus; 15 sheep, two small
boys, and a Land Rover constitute a good crowd there. Anyway, your
office is being wonderfully mean with the invitations, no doubt to save
money, and what better excuse could there be? The problem is that a good
deal of feeling is building up over the bridge and the tolls. Your
advisers will have told you this, of course. (Incidentally, please
invite Warner Meek Communications; they can stand between you and the
sheep.)
The crux of the matter is that the promises made on toll structures
have only been partly honoured. Cars seem to have a good deal and so do
bigger lorries, but as you know well, most of the businessmen drive
small vans. That's where the promise fell down. To increase the prices
over that charged on the ferry for those small commercial vehicles by
300% is unfair. Worse, it is economic lunacy. It will punish small firms
and probably hit employment. It will be even more embarrassing if the
European Union muscles in. After all, it recognises the Highlands and
Islands as one of the poorest areas in Europe. Now these people are
being charged the highest bridge tolls in Europe, and all for the sake
of a free-enterprise bridge monopoly whose only advice is to sell the
Transit and buy an estate car. Frankly, it is not good enough. Promises
are promises and should be honoured.
To be continued.

AFTER six years of deliberation in the Constitutional Convention,
several awkward but vital issues relating to the establishment of a
devolved assembly for Scotland remain unresolved. Shortly, however,
Labour's plans for a Scottish assembly (or parliament) are due to be
finalised and submitted to the convention for ratification. Apart from
the two vexed issues of proportional representation and of gender
balance, both already widely discussed, there are two other equally
difficult questions to be answered. They concern the possibility of
''entrenchment'' of any new assembly and the future position of the
Secretary of State for Scotland.
Entrenchment would mean that the powers of a devolved assembly could
not be removed (or the assembly abolished) by an Act passed at any time
in the future by a simple majority of each House of the Westminster
Parliament. A country with a written constitution, whether federal or
unitary, usually has a special procedure for making amendments to the
constitution. In the UK there is no written constitution of this type
and, indeed, generations of British constitutional lawyers have
expressed satisfaction with the ''flexible'' nature of our unwritten
constitution. The traditional cornerstone of this unwritten constitution
has been the legislative supremacy of the Westminster Parliament, which
means that no parliament can bind its successors and that any Act of
Parliament can be amended or repealed by any subsequent Act.
For example, in June 1979 the incoming Thatcher government used its
parliamentary majority to repeal the Scotland Act 1978 despite the fact
that a majority of Scottish voters had supported the Act, albeit
narrowly, in a referendum three months earlier, and despite the fact
that a majority of Scottish MPs opposed the repeal.
Would it be possible to guarantee that a future government, perhaps
under John Redwood, would not do what Margaret Thatcher did? After all,
the Stormont parliament had been sitting for over 50 years before it was
abolished by a simple Act of the Westminster Parliament. Even if all the
party leaders at Westminster were to give assurances that they would not
abolish a Scottish assembly, these assurances would have less value in
any future Parliament than the pages of Hansard on which they were
printed. Even if every current MP were to endorse the Claim of Right for
Scotland of 1989, this would not bind a Parliament electing in 1997, or
any future Parliament.
Most countries overcome this problem by having a written constitution
which lays down a special procedure for its alteration, subject to
enforcement by a constitutional court, such as the US Supreme Court.
Professor Alan Alexander, in a recent well-argued article in this
newspaper, concluded that only under a federal system could devolved
legislatures be sustained. A federal system, however, requires a written
constitution to allocate powers between the centre and the constituent
parts.
In the United Kingdom neither Labour nor the Conservative Party is
proposing a written constitution. There is no British entrenching tool
available to safeguard a devolved Scottish (or Welsh) assembly.
Denis Canavan MP has proposed a treaty between the Scottish and
Westminster Parliaments to solve the difficulty over entrenchment, but
how would it be possible to have a ''treaty'' between a state and a part
of that state? How could such a ''treaty'' be enforced?
The agreement which created the Union of 1707 is not infrequently
described as a treaty -- a treaty which was also enacted by the
Parliament of each country. Lawyers in Scotland have attempted on a
number of occasions to persuade the Court of Session that the Act of
Union has a special status which should protect at least some of its
provisions from amendment or repeal. The Court of Session on each such
occasion has avoided making any authoritative decision to this effect.
Indeed the court has doubted whether some of the fundamental provisions
of the Act of Union are justiciable.
In England, where the tradition of parliamentary supremacy is
stronger, it is almost inconceivable that the provisions of its Union
with Scotland Act would be enforceable against any subsequent Act.
Only in one area is the traditional doctrine of parliamentary
supremacy threatened, and that is from European Union law. The
jurisprudence of the European Union contains a principle that Community
law is superior to national law in each member state. This principle is
observed by UK courts only because of the implied recognition given to
it by Parliament in the European Communities Act 1972. In theory
Parliament could still repeal the 1972 Act and restore the supremacy of
domestic law.
It could be argued that politically and morally a Scottish assembly,
once established, would be all but unassailable. The snag, of course, is
that a change of government in London could deliver the whole devolution
package into the hands of a government determined to repeal it.
''Entrenchment'' on a political or moral basis would then carry little
weight on the government benches at Westminster.
A further conundrum is the future of the post of the Secretary of
State for Scotland. It has been suggested by at least one Welsh MP that
following Welsh devolution the Secretary of State for Wales would remain
a member of the Cabinet and would continue to attend appropriate
meetings of the Council of Ministers of the EU.
If there were to be a Secretary of State for Scotland after a Scottish
assembly was set up, would he be appointed by the Prime Minister in 10
Downing Street or by the Scottish Premier, or by the Scottish assembly?
How could he sit in the Cabinet in London representing the majority
party in Scotland if that party were different from the majority party
at Westminster? Who would represent Scottish interests at the Council of
Ministers in Brussels, a Secretary of State from London or a minister
from the assembly in Edinburgh? What is to be the role of the Secretary
of State -- ministerial, ceremonial, ambassadorial, or indeed the
colonial governor envisaged under the Scotland Act 1978?
While the role of the Secretary of State might be resolved by some
careful thought, the lack of any entrenchment for a Scottish Assembly is
a serious problem at the heart of any devolution proposals.

ATTITUDES in the prison service have in recent times swung back
towards the idea that rehabilitation of prisoners is a possibility. The
era of ''humane containment'', the notion that there was nothing
meaningful that the prisons could do to change criminals, is now viewed
as a policy of despair. Edward Frizzell, chief executive of the SPS,
encapsulated this thinking when he said yesterday that, while the
prisons alone could not cure society's ills and change criminal
behaviour, the service had a duty to give every prisoner the opportunity
to address offending behaviour and challenge attitudes. The key, he
said, was relevant and soundly based programmes.
The flagship is without doubt the group therapy based at Peterhead
Prison which tackles sex offending. While any meaningful assessment of
its effects is still some time away, the Peterhead programme is gaining
widespread recognition. There are less well-publicised programmes for
sex offenders, notably at Shotts Prison, and, drawing heavily on
Canadian expertise, new programmes to enhance the cognitive skills of
criminals -- teaching them the social controls which we take for granted
but which escaped them as children -- and these may yet bear fruit.
There is an increasing emphasis on tackling alcohol and drug abuse and
educating prisoners away from these problems. These are hopeful
developments.
At the other end of the scale are some in the Tory party obsessed with
glasshouses and boot camps. The senior researcher of the Scottish Prison
Service spent six weeks in America and Canada and came back with the
message that the Americans like them because they save vast sums of
taxpayers' money. When a thief with a three-year sentence signs up for
boot camp in New York he effectively cuts his jail term, and the
attendant expense, by two-thirds. Exhaustive research shows the
boot-camp regime does nothing to cut reoffending, which leaves the
Scottish Office with a serious dilemma. Society must never lose sight of
the other two major elements of imprisonment, the protection of the
public and the need to punish the truly wicked by deprivation of
freedom. But in the face of the American research the Government would
be ill advised to foist boot camps on us for short-term political gain.
That would run the risk of getting the punishment and rehabilitation
elements out of kilter, with no guarantee of value for money, just when
we seem to be getting things right.

Graham Ogilvy examines the remarkable international impact Dundee is
making in the field of cancer research
TODAY'S unprecedented honour accorded to Professor David Lane by the
Curie Institute in Paris and the announcement of #5m in grants from the
Cancer Research Campaign to fund his research teams is proof positive of
Dundee's emergence as a cancer research centre of international
standing.
In a stunning reversal of the brain drain, hundreds of young
post-doctoral scientists from around the world are clamouring to work on
research teams led by Dundee's internationally renowned professors.
Scarcely a week goes by without an announcement of new research
funding for, and significant achievements by, the research teams based
at Dundee University's biochemistry department and its medical school at
Ninewells Hospital.
The air of excitement and enthusiasm among the largely youthful group
of scientists at the sharp end of research into cancer and a range of
other life-threatening diseases is almost palpable.
Dundee has attained a critical mass in cancer research and progress
seems unstoppable. Five years ago, important cancer research teams led
by Professor Lane and Professor David Glover, relocated to Dundee from
England. They were attracted by the standard of research already being
conducted at the university's biochemistry department under Professor
Philip Cohen.
Two years ago, Professor Roland Wolf relocated his Imperial Cancer
Research Fund laboratories to Dundee where his Biomedical Research
Centre now employs 70 scientists at Ninewells Hospital. Most recently,
Professor Peter Hall was lured north from St Thomas's Hospital in
London.
Earlier this year, Professor Cohen's team successfully persuaded the
Wellcome Foundation to provide a #22m grant to the university to build a
new Biomedical Sciences Institute.
About 240 scientists will be recruited to work at the new centre and
applications are flooding in.
Last week, plans were unveiled for a #2m clinical oncology centre at
Ninewells Hospital to apply laboratory research at a clinical level.
When the new biomedical institute is opened in 1997, Dundee will
employ 1500 people in what is termed the biomedical and life sciences.
It is a far cry from the days, in 1971, when the biochemistry
department in Dundee employed just 15 scientists.
A key element in the success of Dundee in developing as Britain's
fourth biomedical centre after Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh has been
interdisciplinary co-operation between pure science and medicine to
produce world-class excellence.
Robert Seaton, secretary of the university, has witnessed the rise of
biomedical sciences to account for more than half of Dundee University's
#20m annual research budget.
He said: ''Professor Peter Garland deserves credit for re-establishing
biochemistry in Dundee by head-hunting about a dozen bright young
scientists in the late sixties and early seventies. Among them was
Philip Cohen who has gained recognition as one of the world's leading
scientists.''
''The emphasis is now moving away from pure science to the application
of that pure science to cracking problems like cancer. Our departments
of anatomy and physiology, pathology and pharmacology are all working in
related fields.''
Professor Lane finds the pioneering spirit in Dundee encouraging and
is heartened by the level of cross-disciplinary collaboration. He said:
''It is useful for people to come to problems from different angles. We
also get a lot of benefit from the research which is undertaken by
Philip Cohen. It means that we can share not just equipment but also
different techniques. The number of groups that we have working here
make so many different techniques available; that is one of Dundee's key
strengths.
''There is a tremendous atmosphere here. It is a real pioneering
spirit. We are showing Oxford and Cambridge that we can do it by
ourselves.''
Last night Professor Cohen, hotly tipped as a future Nobel laureate,
revealed that he has received more than 300 applications for the 30 top
posts at the new Biomedical Institute. ''We offered jobs to eight
outstanding candidates and I am pleased to say that seven have agreed to
come to Dundee.
''These are among the very best of British scientists working in North
America.''

John Linklater examines why, with crowded TV schedules, the Rovers
Return has had its licence extended to four nights a week
MARILYN is horrified to discover that O'Reilly has two wives and warns
Irene to stay clear. The Glovers are relieved when Linda is taken off
the danger list. Annalise is dismayed when she finds her mole is
malignant and needs surgery. Sinbad wants everything to be perfect for
the birth of his child. But over in Weatherfield (if anyone can still
distinguish between the soaps) Bet Gilroy is glad she's getting out of
it. The Rovers Return is going on to a four-day week.
One of the increasingly tenuous differences between reality and the
world of the soaps is that this represents more employment rather than
less for the cast of Coronation Street, and the viewing load of its
audience will go up beyond what many of us would have imagined was
already saturation point.
They will all just have to cope, which is what everyone has to learn
to do in the soaps, and probably represents one of their more useful
lessons.
The ITV Network Centre has decided that we need another weekly episode
of Coronation Street, threatening its perfect trinity of Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays across the weekdays. Since it is inconceivable
that they would want to burden their own weekends, who cares about ours;
there is going to be a terrible vacuum created on a Tuesday or a
Thursday as the only weekday night without Streetlife.
This will enable sociologists and criminologists to isolate trends in
all manner of withdrawal-inflicted maladies, disaffections and public
demonstrations, but you have to wonder if the programmers are being
truly responsible.
With a mere 17 million viewers, or 70% of the available viewing
audience when they churn out the present three weekly episodes, it is
understandable that the Network, in consultation with producers Granada
Television, should have become nervous. The way things were going there
might have been someone out there not watching Coronation Street. If you
thought that was going to be you, they're coming to get you.
If you thought this was just greedy opportunism to rake in more from
the #280m advertising revenue, in that interval that was thoughtfully
supplied for you to light the gas under the kettle when the programme
first went out in 1960 but which is now further compulsory viewing since
mass addiction rendered resistance useless, then you cannot have taken
into account what the Network vaguely terms the ''competition''.
The certainty that EastEnders (14 million), Neighbours (10 million)
and Brookside (6 million) will have to spread themselves from Monday to
Friday should make this a self-fulfilling prophecy. Blame The Archers (4
million), the government information service to farmers and social
workers. They started this invasion of the weekdays.
The cast say it is too much. They would like to do more theatre. If a
fraction of their audience had the faintest idea what a theatre was they
would have been out of their #150,000 jobs years ago. They are a
theatre. Real life just struggles to imitate them. The Carlings and the
Windsors are frustrated soap stars. Another night a week? The cast are
stuck with it. We're all stuck with it.
The Network refers darkly to the arrival of Channel 5 in 1997, as
though they will be handing out franchises next month to bunches of
lunatics with the proposal to programme yet more soaps in direct
competition to Coronation Street. The only time EastEnders made that
mistake, in April 1994, they got badly burned. The Street came out with
twice the audience of its rival, and since then EastEnders has skulked
clear, using a different time slot on Mondays and grabbing those clear
Tuesday and Thursday nights. Everyone knows that Coronation Street is an
institution in itself. What kind of an institution, mental or penal, is
still a matter of debate.
What does it matter, anyway. Anyone who denies they watch it is a
closet case. Ask them to explain why every second video tape in their
possession is riddled with back episodes. The excuse they always use of
programming to the wrong channel is useless. There is nothing on any
other channel at 7.30pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and you
can add another night to that once they get planning permission to
extend the Street from next year. Make that a dual carriageway. Make it
a motorway bulldozed through the national consciousness.
Tony Pearson, senior lecturer in the department of theatre, film and
television studies at Glasgow University, agrees that the audience will
have no choice. If they are hooked into three episodes a week they are
not going to decline the fourth, even if its ''narrative redundancy'' (a
story designed to be picked up if you miss any part of it) makes this a
theoretical possibility.
It is hypnotic. It is part of your life. Maybe it is a substitute for
life itself.
Viewers cannot distinguish. They send hate mail and death threats to
the villains of the Street. They post wedding presents and apply for
jobs at the Rovers Return.
Marriage proposals are superfluous, since they are clearly wedded, as
few real spouses are, to the characters of the soaps. Their loyalty is
total. Their fidelity is awesome, supernatural.
What is another episode a week in such an embracing relationship, so
intertwined a snare?

THE Budget has been privatised. Some of the legislation resulting from
this year's Budget will for the first time be written by private-sector
draftsmen instead of Parliamentary lawyers.
What they draft, though, will still depend on what one man says next
month. It's supposed to be the biggest secret of the year. Even
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's Cabinet colleagues are not told what he will
announce until just before he does so.
William Waldegrave told the Scott Inquiry that Budget secrecy could
justify telling fibs to the House of Commons. Yet it is the most
discussed and guessed-about Ministerial speech every year and the
Government is not above doing a bit of leaking itself.
David Sinton and his colleagues at accountants Touche Ross have been
tracking announcements and pronouncements as they have been made during
the year and have drawn up a detailed list of what next month's Budget
is likely to contain.
Some provisions have already been announced for inclusion, such as the
withdrawal of tax relief for approved executive share option schemes.
This means that executives offered options after July 17 this year will
be liable to income tax when they exercise the options.
Until now an executive with an option to buy shares would pay only
capital gains tax on the difference between the market value of the
shares and the price he had paid -- and he would pay that tax only if
and when he sold the shares.
However, since everyone has an annual #6000 capital gains tax
exemption, the smart executive would sell the shares in different
financial years to avoid tax. Now, since his personal income tax
allowance will have been used up by his salary, share options are being
brought into the tax net.
And he cannot put off the tax until he sells the shares -- it becomes
due when he exercises his option to buy them. It will probably mean
executives will sell their shares sooner to pay the tax bill.
Another change announced in July will be to exempt payments made under
mortgage protection policies from tax. A third change will affect the
way institutions are taxed on their investments in gilts and bonds, but
it will not affect individuals with less than #200,000 invested.
Some pre-announced changes mean that other measures are likely to be
in the Budget. Bringing executive share option schemes into the income
tax net makes it likely that Save-As-You-Earn option schemes that
involved all employees and profit-sharing schemes will have the tax
threshold on them raised.
Also likely are an increase in inheritance tax exemption for property
transferred to spouses abroad and a new basis for taxing living
accommodation provided by employers.
Predicting the more interesting changes, though, takes a little more
detective work.
With more senior Government members apparently resigned to slow
progress on the economic front, 1997 would seem to be a more likely
election year than 1996. Given the Chancellor's ''steady as she goes''
approach, cuts in actual tax rates look set to wait another year in
spite of his more vociferous colleagues.
That would still leave scope for changes in personal allowances and
the tax bands to show a little sympathy to the electorate rather than an
outright buying of the feel-good factor.
A 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax would cost the government
#1700m in 1995-96, and #2100m in 1996-97, whereas increasing all
personal allowances by 1% would cost little more than a tenth of that:
#190m in the current year and #240m in the next. Raising the personal
allowance by #100 would cost #490m and #630m respectively.
Increasing the lower-rate band of tax by 10% would cut #250m and #320m
from the Chancellor's take. Lifting the basic-rate band by 10% would
cost #580m and #860m.
Therefore the Chancellor can be expected to come up with some
combination of these which will signal his good intentions but not cost
him too much.
Other taxes are likely to have their starting points raised, with an
increase in the registration threshold for VAT, in the small companies
threshold for corporation tax and in the nil-band for inheritance tax,
perhaps even by more than the rate of inflation.
Each 1% increase in the small companies tax threshold for corporation
tax would cost the Chancellor only #80m in the current year and #120m in
the next. He could afford to be more generous with inheritance tax:
increasing the tax threshold by as much as #5000 would cost him only
#16m this year and #33m next.
That would leave Kenneth Clarke with a number of options he could use
to tackle particular problems. The problem of paying for long-term care
of the elderly might be tackled by allowing more flexibility in pension
schemes.
Other ways of tackling the problem would be to exempt the old person's
house when calculating how much capital he or she has, and to give tax
relief on insurance for care costs.
Any attempt to lift the continuing depression in the housing market
must be made without the risk of fuelling inflation or overheating the
economy. Therefore he would be restricted to raising the stamp duty
threshold.
Little more could be done with stamp duty: last year it brought the
Government #1822m.
He is politically constrained from doing too much with mortgage tax
relief as its value has, as a matter of policy, been brought down
gradually to its present level of 15%.
Self-assessment, as described in The Herald yesterday, starts to be
introduction next year with the first new-style tax returns likely to be
submitted to the Revenue 18 months from now.
The confusion that threatens its introduction may persuade the
Chancellor to simplify some legislation, such as capital gains tax. If
small investors did not have to include details of capital gains if the
total proceeds of the sale were below a certain limit, such as #20,000,
it would ease some of the burden of the new system.
It will not all be an easing of the tax burden, though, however
slight. Insurance premium tax, one of Mr Clarke's own introductions, is
a possible candidate for an increase about its current rate of 2.5%.
Against that increase, there may be new tax reliefs for life insurance
and mortgage protection policies.
For very low earners, it is possible that the 2% rate of National
Insurance contribution, described in The Herald yesterday as ''the
hidden tax'', could be abolished. For the better off, new rules could be
introduced restricting profit-related pay. Tax reliefs could be extended
for child care.
Company taxes will not be reduced -- if the Chancellor did not cut
them during the recession, he will not do it now -- except by increasing
the corporation tax threshold for small firms, as already mentioned.
If Mr Clarke was feeling really generous toward business, though, he
could introduce a lower-band of corporation tax, say 20%, to help
growing smaller companies.
The rules could be changed to make the cost of raising equity finance
tax-deductible. The CBI has also proposed that companies in certain
sectors, such as biotechnology should be able to surrender losses to the
Treasury in return for a tax credit to be used against their PAYE
liabilities, though the Health Secretary has expressed a lack of
enthusiasm for the idea.
Finally the amount that employers can claim against tax for
entertaining staff at Christmas parties could be raised. Well, after
all, the Budget now falls in the month before Christmas.

SCOTLAND will receive around #24m from new European Union funding
announced yesterday. The money will go to a series of community
initiatives, mainly involving training and job creation, and must be
matched under EU rules by funding from the Scottish Office between now
and 1999.
The money is part of a final package worth #1300m for all 15 EU member
states and was announced yesterday by Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies,
Commissioner for regional policy.
The sums involved were included, in principle, in the economic aid
package negotiated at the Edinburgh summit three years ago, and held in
a reserve fund until plans were made on how the money could be best
spent. The details of how much each member state would receive were
finally made known yesterday.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies, who is investigating the Scottish Office for
suspected misuse of EU structural funding, told The Herald she had no
information so far about the progress of her inquiries.
She is looking at allegations that Scottish Ministers, possibly with
Treasury collusion, used EU structural funding improperly to fatten
public utilities ahead of privatisation.
The Commissioner has already expressed dissatisfaction with Government
replies to her questions and has ordered fresh inquiries. If the
Government is held to have misused EU funding, it could be forced to
repay the money.
Her EU-wide spending announcement is meant to provide 10,000 new jobs
in the community, in addition to the 1,000,000 jobs expected by the
Commission from total structural fund spending of about #117,000m
between 1994 and the end of the century.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies said the principle behind her announcement was the
fight against unemployment.
''We hope to create jobs, to support local employment initiatives, and
to improve training,'' she said.
Almost half of the money will go to areas classified as Objective 1 by
the Commission, as those in most need. In Scotland's case, this will
involve the area covered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise Board.
Britain came fourth of the 15 member states in line for community
initiatives. First was Germany -- main economic pillar of the EU -- with
projects in eastern Germany now recovering from its Communist years.
Second were the Spanish, and the Italians were third.
Britain will receive #150m and, under EU funding rules, Scotland does
proportionately better than under Westminster rules for public spending.
The EU routinely gives Scotland about 16% of structural funds. The
figure in Westminster is closer to 10%.

THE General Teaching Council for Scotland has sharply criticised
Government proposals for a nursery education voucher system.
Its response -- made on the final day of a six-week consultation
period -- represents a further knock to the controversial plan, which
has already been condemned by a number of educational bodies.
Under the Scottish Office scheme, parents of each four-year-old child
would be given a voucher worth #1100 to help buy nursery provision.
Meeting in Oban yesterday, the 49-strong GTC, which has a membership
of 77,000 teachers, unanimously approved a paper which described the
proposal as ''of little merit''.
Its policy paper added: ''The proposed voucher scheme will not
guarantee quality and may in certain respects produce the opposite
effect.
''If these proposals are enacted, they will almost certainly damage
the existing local authority arrangements for pre-school education.
''It is a matter of regret that the opportunity to expand and improve
the provision of pre-school education throughout Scotland has been
missed.''
The chairman of the GTC's education committee, Mr Anthony Finn, told
the meeting that the voucher plan had ''severely tested'' the council's
long-standing practice of being constructive.
He said the Scottish Office had missed an opportunity to extend
nursery provision into a quality service for all children aged three to
five, and the expertise of local authorities had been ''largely
ignored''.
The policy paper approved by the council also maintained that the
#1100 vouchers would be ''socially divisive'', since people on lower
incomes and the unemployed would be unable to top up the figure.
Mr Finn said there were also ''no real arrangements'' to support
children from ethnic communities in the proposals.
He described the plan as ''unnecessary, probably unworkable, and
certainly irrelevant to the needs of vast swathes of our children''.

A NEW drug likely to be approved soon for NHS use to treat multiple
sclerosis may prove difficult to obtain, in spite of Government
assurances yesterday that it will not be rationed.
Interferon Beta 1b is expected to be licensed within a few weeks by
the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, which will include the UK.
The drug is estimated to cost #10,000 for a year's supply for one
patient and the Department of Health stepped in to quash fears that its
availability might be restricted.
Trials in America have indicated that it cuts relapses in the disease
by a third. On that basis, it could benefit the one-in-eight of
Britain's 80,000 MS sufferers who are in a remission-relapse cycle.
''If there is a patient who can clearly benefit from the treatment,
clearly they should have that treatment and it should be funded,'' said
a Department of Health spokesman.
However, guidance to be issued by the NHS Executive will ask GPs to
let specialist consultants decide who should be treated with Beta
Interferon.
Since 1991, it has been the rule that whoever makes the clinical
decision to prescribe a drug is responsible for meeting the cost of the
drug.
The department confirmed that the drug would have to be paid for out
of hospital budgets, which are cash-limited, rather than from GP
prescription budgets, which are not.
Ultimately, the decision will have to come from health boards but
budgets for buying hospital services are already under tremendous strain
because of the minuscule growth provided for in this year's Budget
allocation.
The arrival of the new drug comes hard on the heels of the discovery
that HIV patients can be helped by combinations of certain drugs which
could cost #5000 a year and it is the latest in a generation of
expensive new therapies for which health authorities have to budget.

By FRANCIS SHENNAN
IF the best political guesses are correct, the Budget after next
year's will be a Labour one -- and there is always the possibility it
will be sooner. But how much would a Labour Budget really differ from
Kenneth Clarke's?
Labour would like to see a reorganisation of the tax system, which
might include a commission to show people the impact of tax on incomes,
and to ensure that it follows equitable principles.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown has said that Inland Revenue and
Customs and Excise procedures would be harmonised to reduce collection
costs. Courts would be asked to interpret tax legislation in a less
literal way and with a greater regard for what the legislation is
intended to do.
It is the details, however, which will decide what we have left after
tax. Experts in the major accountacy firms, such as KPMG and Touche
Ross, have been following the speeches and news released by the Labour
Party.
In its last manifesto, Labour promised a new 50% rate of income tax
for those earning more than #40,000. It has hardly been mentioned since.
A Tony Blair government would almost certainly keep the present tax
rates of 20%, 25%, and 40%, although the bands might be widened to ease
the tax burden on the lower-paid. A 50% tax rate would probably be
introduced, but almost certainly not below #40,000, and perhaps well
above that level.
If there were to be a higher tax rate than 50%, it would probably not
affect anyone earning less than six figures.
Tax on benefits in kind will be tightened up and they may be included
in the calculations for National Insurance, so that such benefits lose
any advantage over direct pay.
Judging from the debate on this year's Finance Bill, Labour is
probably in favour of profit-related pay but, like Mr Clarke, would like
to see the tax rules tightened.
Share option schemes, which are already to be brought into the income
tax net in next month's Budget, will be limited by having to be matched
by improvements in company performance, and will have to be open to all
employees.
Mortgage tax relief would probably continue to be phased out -- it is
already down in value to only 15%, under the present Government -- but
the need to stimulate the house-building market may prompt special help
for first-time buyers only.
Tax relief on private medical insurance for the over-60s would go. The
scope for using Venture Capital Trusts and Enterprise Investment Schemes
to escape tax would be cut back, and Personal Equity Plans (PEPs) could
come under close scrutiny.
Loopholes involving the use of trusts will be closed, and the use of
tax relief to invest in oil production is also seen as a loophole.
The Liberal Democrats in 1992, said they would add 2p to the basic
rate of income tax, and in their 1994 Alternative Budget said they would
introduce a 50% tax rate for those earning more than #100,000.
Higher-rate tax bands might be increased to 60%.
But they would also cut both employers' and employees' National
Insurance contributions, and would like to see NI replaced with an
integrated tax on all earned and unearned income, including compulsory
pension contributions to the age of 60.
VAT on domestic fuel would be cut to the European Union minimum of 5%,
and they would push for a European carbon tax.
They would phase out the married couple's allowance and mortgage tax
relief, replace the personal allowance with a flat tax credit, and
increase child benefit by #5 a week. PEPs and Tax Exempt Savings Schemes
(TESSAs) would be replaced by a tax credit against certain investment
income.
Earlier this year, Mr Andrew Smith, Shadow Chief Secretary to the
Treasury, told the Institute of Taxation it was unfair that wealthier
and better-advised people escape inheritance tax, when the less rich
without inheritance tax must pay it.
Devices such as deeds of variation and conditional exemptions for
works of art are considered loopholes and will be closed. Farmland is
also sometimes used to shelter homes from inheritance tax, but genuine
farming businesses would be protected from being broken up.
Mr Smith has also said that Labour wants to make it easier for
businesses to remain intact and to be transferred between generations
and employees.
The current nil-band for inheritance tax stops at #154,000 but, as the
Inland Revenue's chart shows, nearly half of the assets which attract
the tax are homes. To avoid scaring off southern English voters with
expensive houses, Labour could leave the nil-band as it is or even
increase it.
Increasing the threshold by #5000 would cost a Labour government only
around #30m a year, which it could easily recoup by increasing the tax
rates for larger estates.
The Liberal Democrats are in favour of taxing the recipients of
legacies and gifts as part of their income.
One firm of accountants, Rutherford Manson Dowds, has said that
clients have disposed of assets because of worries about Labour plans
for capital gains tax. Labour has suggested reducing the annual
exemption, abolishing the ability to index-link the purchase price as a
way of reducing the capital gain, and limiting the ability to defer tax.
What Labour is most concerned to do, however, is to design a new
structure to encourage long-term investment, and it may introduce
different rates of tax to encourage this, such as reducing the tax in
proportion to how long the asset has been held.
On company tax, Labour, which has already established the Advisory
Panel on Corporate Taxation -- which has members from industry, the
City, accountancy, and universities -- is keen to deal with the
substance of financial devices.
It wants the Inland Revenue to have the power to look behind the legal
form of arrangements and to act quickly to plug newly-discovered
loopholes.
The small companies' tax rate should, said Mr Smith, be linked to a
measure of size, such as turnover, instead of profits, which can be
manipulate. But Labour has said the tax system would be changed to give
small firms a greater incentive to retain earnings for investment.
Employers who take on someone who has been unemployed for 12 months or
more would have a six-month holiday from contributions, as long as the
job is full-time, pays at least the minimum wage, and offers training.
If the person had been unemployed for two years or more, the employer
would get a #75-a-week tax rebate over the first six months.
The cost would be met by a windfall tax on the privatised utilities,
formally announced by Mr Brown on the first day of the party conference
this week, which he expects to raise #1000m. He also announced that
halving VAT on domestic fuel, which would cost the Exchequer #480m,
would be a top priority for a Labour government.

Robert Curran, former Provost of Alva and prominent Nationalist, born
September 14, 1923, died September 28, 1995
THE influence on the Scottish National Party of lifelong supporter
Robert Curran was generally regarded as immense, reaching down through
the generations. In addition, he once held the distinction of being
Scotland's youngest Provost.
Mr Curran, who lived at Kirk Court, Tillicoultry, was a native of
Alva, emigrating with his family to Canada as a boy and spending much of
his childhood there.
He returned in time for secondary schooling, however, attending Alva
Academy.
Robert Curran lived and breathed the nationalist cause, and it was
said that his approach to his country was typical of someone who had
spent time beyond its shores.
His involvement with the SNP dated back to the early 1940s, when he
stood unsuccessfully but creditably for Parliament in the old Stirling
burghs constituency.
At the age of 21 he was elected a member of Alva Burgh Council on the
SNP ticket, and at the age of 25 became the youngest Provost in
Scotland.
He was national secretary of the SNP between 1951 and 1953, and became
convener of the party's organising committee between 1953 and 1954.
He also formed the National League for Young Scots, taking a party to
Dublin in 1953, ostensibly to play football but contriving to use the
visit to meet and talk with the Irish patriot, Prime Minister, and later
President, Eamon De Valera.
He then left Scotland again, crossing the Atlantic -- this time of his
own volition -- to spend some time in America, returning in 1974 just in
time to see George Reid win the parliamentary seat of Clackmannan for
the SNP.
In 1980 he was elected to Clackmannan District Council, and served for
four years. The funeral took place on Tuesday at Tillicoultry Parish
Church.
A bachelor, Robert Curran is survived by a brother George and niece
Anne, who both live in Clackmannanshire, and a nephew Robert who is
serving in the American Air Force.

Mollie Harris, actress, writer, broadcaster; born June 23, 1913, died
October 3
TO the millions who follow that national institution, The Archers,
Mollie Harris was better known as Martha Woodford, keeper of the Penny
Hassett post-office shop in the longest-running of all radio soaps.
Having raised much money for cancer research and for the Sir Michael
Sobell House in Oxford, it was appropriate that, having suffered from
the disease herself, she was to end her days in that Oxford haven.
In an age when actors portray characters usually with backgrounds
quite different from their own, Mollie Harris had a real-life, rural
existence which fitted her well for the radio drama. Born in the
Cotswold village of Ducklington, near Witney, she never moved more than
a few miles from her birthplace, even when she married Ginger Harris, a
local central heating engineer, in 1937.
She had grown up in that rustic setting where the horse still pulled
the cart and cows meandered along country lanes on the way to milking.
Her mother taught her all the domestic arts which later brought delight
to the cast of The Archers when Mollie would turn up with her delicious
home-baking -- and some of her potent sloe gin to wash it down!
During the war you would find her driving a grocer's lorry, loading
and unloading heavy sacks, and even after the war she was still engaged
in manual work, picking and sorting potatoes and bringing in the harvest
on local farms. Her quarter-century on The Archers was still a long way
off. It was while working on the farms that she began to jot down the
experiences, along with recipes from the farmers' wives.
That prompted her to send stories to Phil Drabble, who presented In
The Country, and that was how her broadcasting career began.
Particularly in her own part of England, the voice of Mollie Harris
became well-known.
In 1969 she published her autobiography, A Kind of Magic, which was
followed by Another Kind of Magic and then by The Green Years, and they
were brought together just this year as a trilogy under the title of All
Kinds of Magic.
It was in the midst of this writing career that Mollie Harris joined
The Archers in 1970, by then aged 57. She began as Martha, widow of
postman Herbert Lily, who then married Joby Woodford, who persuaded her
to take the job at the post-office-cum-shop.
That was when she became a central character in the Ambridge
community, golden-hearted but gossipy, often getting it wrong but
attracting the other versions from people intent on putting her right.
In these days of cynicism and uncertainty, she was part of a series
which retains a massive popularity, perhaps not least because it reminds
us of a world which was more recognisable and dependable.
Mollie was last heard on August 29, in an episode recorded about a
month before that, and the BBC is now faced with the periodic nightmare
of knowing what to do with the character. Respectfully, it invariably
consults the real-life family to gauge their feelings on the matter.
Throughout her time on The Archers, Mollie became a prolific writer of
books, which ranged from The Magic of the Cotswold Way to a couple of
volumes which reflected her enthusiasm for traditional sanitation. They
were called Cotswold Privies and Privies Galore.
As well as writing her books she was an enthusiastic promoter of their
sales, undertaking large numbers of speaking engagements and carrying
them with her for sale.
Through it all, she remained a warmly ebullient figure, now survived
by her only son, Peter.

Susan Fleetwood, actress, born September 21, 1944, died September 29
SUSAN FLEETWOOD, who has died of cancer at the age of 51, was an
actress on whom many a current drama student might model a successful
career. She devoted herself to the stage, but did not shun television.
She picked her few film roles carefully. She worked with the top
companies in the country and helped establish a continuing one some 30
years ago.
Her death at a young age has not only deprived the theatre-going
public of the joys of seeing her in older roles, but also probably
denied her the widespread public recognition she deserved and which
often comes late in life.
For many people, her face will be most familiar from her work on
television, particularly in Hanif Kureishi's The Buddha of Suburbia and
particularly as policewoman Kate Phillips in Chandler &amp; Co. Given her
classical theatre background, she was a natural for The Jewel In The
Crown and the BBC adpatation of Jane Austen's Persuasion. The same
casting turn of mind gave her roles in the films Heat and Dust and White
Mischief, but she was equally at home in The Krays or, particularly,
Andrei Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice.
But it was as a stage actress with the Royal Shakespeare Company and
the National Theatre that Fleetwood will be most fondly remembered by
colleagues and fans. Born in St Andrews in 1944, she was the daughter of
an Army family and the family moved around a great deal, including a
pre-Suez stint in Egypt (where she made her stage debut in a children's
show), and a period in Norway where her father had a Nato job and she
appeared as Joseph in a school production of the biblical story.
The itinerant lifestyle has been noted to foster restless artists and
while her brother Mick went on to form the most successful blues band of
the period, Fleetwood Mac, Susan Fleetwood was sent to a convent school
after failing her 11-plus and from there won a scholarship to the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts at the age of 16.
At college she met Terry Hands, who was to be her partner for nine
years and important influence on her life, and began Shakespearian
career, playing Lady Macbeth, and Rosalind in As You Like It on tour in
Tuscon and Phoenix, Arizona. Hands was Orlando. Back in Britain the pair
were part of a group who established the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool,
with a classical repertoire which would be familiar to fans of the
Citizens' in the 1980s and Fleetwood both acting and adminstrating the
company.
Three years later she and Hands went to the RSC and apart from
sojourns with the Prospect and Cambridge Theatre Companies, she remained
there for 10 years. Only a year after her arrival her interpretation of
the role of Regan in King Lear insured that everything she did
subsequently was eagerly noted. In the early seventies her performance
as Portia in The Merchant of Venice, succeeding Judy Dench, a
controversial scene where she simulated orgasm in Hands's production of
Murder in the Cathedral, and her Katherine in The Taming Of The Shrew,
opposite Alan Bates, rewarded the attention.
At the National (which she joined after Peter Hall succeeded Laurence
Olivier) she was the only English actor -- in the central role of Pegeen
Mike -- in an all-Irish production of The Playboy of the Western World.
There was Irish blood on both sides of her family, certainly, but she
repeated the solo trick as Nora in O'Casey's The Plough and the Stars a
few years later. In between she was Ophelia to Albert Finney's Hamlet, a
role she had also played memorably opposite Ian McKellen with the
Cambridge Theatre Company.
With that company she had also played Nina in the Seagull, and in the
nineties she played Arkadina in the same play at Stratford, a
performance described in The Herald as ''consummate -- beautiful,
passionate, assured, yet with an underlying, driven restlessness''. Her
performance in Much Ado About Nothing from the same season was ''a
deliciously frolicsome Beatrice, executing little kicks and leaps of
delight to express her joy in life''.
Despite her extrovert nature in theatrical company, Susan Fleetwood
remained a solitary person and she never married although her life
included several long relationships.

Sir Fred Warner, GCVO, KCMG, former British Ambassador to Japan and
Conservative MEP; born May 2, 1918, died September 30, 1995
FRED WARNER'S breadth of vision and interest spread his not
inconsiderable talents across three different careers, most notably that
of diplomat which led him to the post of British Ambassador to Japan
between 1972 and 1975.
But, for some, his name is still linked with that turbulent period of
the early 1950s when he worked in the private office of Scotland's
Hector McNeil, Minister of State at the Foreign Office.
It was then that he found himself working alongside another Private
Secretary, the infamous Guy Burgess, who turned out to be a Soviet spy
and whose name was so closely linked with that of Donald Maclean when
the pair defected to Moscow in 1951.
In the post-mortem on how it had all gone wrong, fingers were pointed
at those closest to the situation, with the inference that somebody
should have done something about it. Perhaps, quite unfairly, Fred
Warner came into that category.
When matters had settled, however, his career progressed with
appointments to Rangoon, where he found great joy in the Burmese
culture, and then as Ambassador to Laos, at a time when Indo-China was
running towards chaos.
With an American mother, Warner found himself much at home in his
appointment to the United Nations in New York, where his success in
diplomacy led to his appointment as Ambassador to Japan.
As a man of much wit and intelligence, he had also seemed a confirmed
bachelor until 1971, when he married Mrs Simone Georgina de Ferranti, by
whom he had two sons, as well as gaining a stepdaughter.
He harboured an ambition to end his days as ambassador in Paris or
Washington but, when that did not materialise, he left the Diplomatic
Service in 1975, when he was 57.
It gave him time to switch careers before it was too late and his
sights were now trained on the European Parliament in Strasbourg. In
Europe's first direct elections in 1979, he became Conservative MEP for
Somerset, coming back to his own continent with that vast experience of
the wider world.
In 1984, however, Fred Warner quit politics altogether and entered a
third phase, that of businessman, with a number of directorships in
insurance, chemicals, and banking, including the chairmanship of
Guinness Peat (Overseas) Ltd. He was also chairman of the oversees
committee of the Confederation of British Industry.
That entry to the Foreign Service in 1946 had come after wartime years
in the Royal Navy, which in turn had followed his days at the Royal
Naval College, Dartmouth, and Magdalen College, Oxford.
He is survived by his wife, two sons, and stepdaughter.

FOTOFEIS hasn't even begun, yet already I'm impressed. A rare reaction
from The Herald's art critic? Let's say unique! For this second Fotofeis
International Festival of Photography in Scotland has been revving up
for weeks and tomorrow has lift off.
Fotofeis is an ambitious affair with a #300,000 budget. It's Britain's
leading photo bonanza, presenting more than 100 exhibitions by artists
from 25 countries. It's nation-wide, running from Benbecula to
Peterhead, Abroath to Ayr, Castlemilk and St Enochs to Dumfries. Already
a superb -- and these days, cheap -- 192-page combined catalogue and an
excellent free brochure is actually on the streets, published two whole
weeks early. Then there's an amazing array of 130 events: debates,
talks, tours, workshops, community projects, performances, videos, films
and night-time projections on buildings and shops plus a big conference.
So what's the secret? ''Fotofeis's strength lies in collaboration on a
grand scale,'' says director, Alasdair Foster, the driving force behind
this all-embracing concept of spotlighting photo-based arts in all their
diverse forms.
Foster himself has an interesting background. Trained in pure science
at Edinburgh, his degree combined physics, history of science,
photography and theatre. He then worked in films, later as a commercial
photographer making his living specialising in shooting glossy pictures
of food. Soon he was curating photo exhibitions -- and so to Fotofeis.
Its scope is awesome. ''Whoever you are, Fotofeis is for you'' is the
slogan. And it's true. Photos ancient and modern from India, Mexico,
Czechslovakia, Dundee, Berlin, Monktonhall, Italy, and West Africa mix
with family snaps and children's photos. There is a big Canadian
presence with 25 artists representing eight provinces from Newfoundland
to British Columbia. Black and white, and colour pictures by world names
like Ansel Adams, Minor White, Stieglitz and Paul Strand in the National
Gallery contrast with photos by young emerging artists in city shop
windows and newspapers. Serious, upsetting images; gentle poetic
landscapes; sexy nudes; gruesome cadavers. Above all Fotofeis is
eclectic. One black and white image on show, of roses, taken in 1924 by
Tina Modotti, is the most expensive photograph in the world, selling for
$165,000 at Sothebys in New York in 1991.
Today the actual events get on the road with exhibition openings in
Ayr, Kilmarnock, Paisley, and Glasgow. Tomorrow it's Edinburgh, then
Dundee, Greenock, and Aberdeen on Monday ending with a major three-day
conference for European Photographers in Aberdeen from November 3.
Foster and his small team can be proud of themselves so far. The proof
of the pudding will be in the next four weeks. Visitor figures for
Fotofeis 1993 were almost half a million. Round two augers well, so
perhaps it will be a bumper year.
Already more than 50 delegates and artists are in town, from as far
away as India, Japan, the US, and Russia as this 1995 Fotofeis puts the
emphasis back on the practitioners and away from the theorists. Not a
bad thing.
With such a cumbersome festival, Foster has sensibly divided it into
sections. There are three main themes: Cities, Migration, and Mortality,
complemented by two sections on collaboration and on young folk, little
known outside their own countries.
Obviously no-one is expected to see more than a fraction of what's on
offer -- though in 1993 one man actually claimed to visit the lot -- but
here's a taste of my sampling so far.
Diana Thorycroft at Edinburgh's Collective has a memorable show. One
of her Manitoba students, ''whose wheelchair wasn't going to stop her''
inspired new, luminous, disturbing images quite foreign to previously
sensual but disturbing concoctions of dolls and babies, leaves, and
drapes. Intense, honest and a must.
Stills (one of the three specialist photo galleries in Scotland; the
others are Portfolio and Glasgow's Street Level) shows Witkin's
controversial dark side of life. He gives famous old master painting a
sadistic twist. Technically astounding, I still find his art-about-art
derivative.
After this, Colin Gray's burlesque colour narrative of his parents
acting out his fantasies is something you'll love. Documented over 15
years, Mr and Mrs Gray are obviously a remarkable couple who have
contributed no end to their son's artistic career. Colin is a lucky chap
whose housewife mum has retained her film star looks and acquired
considerable acting ability.
Three shows, Indian Dreams at Kilmarnock and 1950s and sixties West
African shots at Edinburgh's Fruitmarket look at ''posing''. However
poor, people like to look their best and Keita and Sidibe's exuberant,
elegant images are magic.
Ironically amid the triumph that is Fotofeis, Glasgow Museums
shamefully let the side down and without the enterprising Martine
Beugnet of the French Institute -- and French cash -- there would be
nothing at all in any of Glasgow''s 11 civic galleries.
''They are afraid of photography, suspicious of it and Fotofeis,''
Martine said.
She persevered and part of Whispers, her ''interventions'' project is
at the Transport Museum and Kelvingrove as well as the Hunterian,
Edinburgh's College of Surgeons, Museum of Childhood, Royal Museum,
National Gallery and Calton Hill Monument where Jane Brettle is
installing mirrors visible from Princes Street. Fab.

DAVID BELCHER speaks to no-nonsense music star Elkie Brooks on her
career and discovers why she never made it big-time across the atlantic
YEARS later, too late to make much difference, Elkie Brooks discovered
why the American arm of her old record company, A &amp; M, hadn't made the
efforts on her behalf in the US that she'd have liked them to.
''My husband, Trevor, eventually found out that Jerry Moss, the 'M' in
A &amp; M, had said something like: 'Why should we promote Elkie Brooks in
the States when we've already got several Elkie Brookses in the States?'
''
Over the phone-line there follows a brittle silence. Plainly, there's
still annoyance about the fact that Elkie's British chart success in the
late seventies never received a fully-funded transatlantic translation.
You can see A &amp; M's point, though. From Tina Turner to Janis Joplin,
America has had a patent on bluesy warblers with a gravelly squawk --
why should it need to import more of them from Britain? It's the same
with crooners and croakers: they're all stamped Made In USA. Not that
that stopped America going ga-ga over a Yorkshire lad who in 1974
forsook a humdrum British rock-soul outfit called Vinegar Joe and
re-invented himself as a languid Long Island lounge lizard, one Robert
Palmer.
Brooks is naturally swift to pooh-pooh the notion of any resentment
over the glittering global career of her erstwhile Vinegar Joe vocal
foil. Robert Palmer's lived in millionaire seclusion, first in Nassau
and latterly in Switzerland. Brooks resides happily en famille in rural
Devon, which nevertheless doesn't have the same cachet.
''I've obviously watched Robert's career. I've no animosity towards
him. I admire him as a writer, or I wouldn't have recorded his song,
Circles, as the title track of my last album.
''But I felt very sad when Vinegar Joe broke up, because I thought
there was still a future for the band. If Robert hadn't decided to go
solo a year before the band came to an end, I wouldn't have gone solo.
''But I've done well. You can't go around being envious of others.
I've a great family life with my husband and two sons, and I'm not
totally and utterly immersed in the shallowness of the music business. I
got my first dan in aikido at 50. I've my own studio here, but I'm
outdoors a lot, which is healthy. I didn't have the good fortune to be
promoted in the US. I can sell records in the UK, but that's a drop in
the ocean worldwide. So I've had to go on the road to earn my living.''
Brooks's long road winds into Scotland very soon, with gigs at
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre on October 8, Aberdeen's Capitol Theatre on
October 9, and Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall on October 10. They'll be
shows numbers nine, 10, and 11 on a substantial 62-date UK tour.
In all, Brooks has been on the road for more than 30 years in a wide
variety of guises. She was born Elaine Bookbinder in Salford,
Manchester's earthy near-neighbour, where her first singing lessons were
provided by her rabbi. Encouraged by trad-jazz daddio Humphrey Lyttelton
and touted as ''Manchester's answer to Brenda Lee,'' she joined the Eric
Delaney band on the ballroom swing circuit as a teenage balladeer.
Those far-off swinging sixties having sunk swing bands, Brooks was
next marketed without success as a sub-Motown soul chick by the
distinctly unsoulful Decca label before joining up with Robert Palmer in
another failed rockbiz exercise in trend-hopping, Dada, a 12-piece
progressive jazz-rock combo.
The cod-hippie rock-soul of Vinegar Joe soon followed, Brooks sporting
satin waistcoats and a lot of hair. Upon Vinegar Joe's demise, Brooks
filled in time with a three-month spell with unlamented Alabama
blues-boogie men Wet Willie.
Having veered in vain from one side of pop's stylistic highway to
another, Brooks found her reward when she stayed in the middle of the
road . . . MOR: the mainstream, middle-brow genre which infuriates the
critics and delights the paying public.
Between 1977 and 1986 Elkie achieved top 10 easy-listening hits with
Pearl's A Singer, Sunshine After The Rain, Don't Cry Out Loud, Fool If
You Think It's Over, Nights In White Satin, and No More The Fool. Two of
Brooks's early-eighties albums, Pearls and Pearls II, jointly notched up
104 weeks in the UK top 100.
Not that everything was plain sailing for Brooks. As we've seen, she
fell out badly with the A &amp; M label. And with their successors, Legend.
And with their successors, Telstar. The label after that, Permanent,
were ''sweet'', but got left behind when they couldn't stump up for a
big TV ad campaign. Brooks is presently engaged in litigation with three
former companies over unpaid royalties.
More happily, her current label, Carlton, do have sufficient loot to
hire the 70-strong Royal Philharmonic for her forthcoming album, due out
next spring, which will re-work past Brooks hits as well as more obscure
stuff from her 12-album history.
Picking good tunes has never been as great a problem as selecting
labels seems to have been. Brooks's ear for a well-crafted surefire
toe-tapper has been re-endorsed of late, first by the
critically-acclaimed Jeff Buckley, who last year oozed through Lilac
Wine. Currently Berri is in the UK top 10 with Sunshine After The Rain.
Brooks hasn't heard either of them, although she has heard of them.
What constitutes a good song then? ''Melody. Good chord-changes. Strong
lyrics.''
A no-nonsense answer. In contrast, the music business is full of
nonsense, of course. It warps people's ideas of themselves. Which is why
Brooks keeps her distance. She's seen what can happen.
''I remember one early solo gig in Glasgow. I was pregnant with my
first son, Jay, who's now 16 and working as my band's drum
technician-cum-video camera-man. Cher, who was married at the time to
Gregg Allman, was in the theatre across the road from us, and while we
were playing to a packed house, it was entirely the opposite for them.
''But we were all staying in the same hotel, and after the shows Cher
and Gregg wouldn't talk to us. Very snotty. Then again, I'm sure the
theatre she was in was a lot nicer than ours . . . we always seemed to
play in such naff places. It would be the old Apollo, I think . . . I
remember nearly having a heart attack when half the dressing-room
ceiling came down on top of me.''
Plaster in one's bouffant. It would maybe keep your head level while
all around, others are having theirs filled with rock-star mince.

THE number of taxpayers in Scotland fell by 40,000 between 1992 and
1993, according to the latest figures published by the Inland Revenue,
for a variety of reasons.
There are fears that the number could fall again if a Scottish
Parliament uses its power to levy an income tax of up to 3p.
Donald Adamson, a former tax inspector and now a partner with KPMG Tax
Advisers, says he has heard chief executives from half a dozen companies
say privately, but in all seriousness, that if a Scottish Parliament
increased income tax by 1p, they would move their company headquarters
south of the Border.
The irony is, he says, that if a Scottish Parliament could use its tax
powers in reverse -- but cutting income tax -- it could probably raise
more money.
''If people in Scotland are saying, 'If the rate of tax goes up here,
we'll move our business to England', there must be people in England who
would move here if tax rates were lower,'' he said.
He argues that such a cut would be more effective in helping Scotland
than the 1970s' Labour policy of extensive regional assistance.
Moving a company head office to Scotland would not only bring the tax
revenue of the employees, including the company's most senior people, it
would attract the work of ancillary professional services, such as
lawyers, accountants . . . and, of course, tax advisers.
Cutting the basic rate of income tax by 1p would cost a British
Government #2100m in a full year. So a 1p cut in the basic rate in
Scotland alone would cost a Scottish Parliament roughly #187m.
If it had to recoup that loss through the basic-rate tax of incoming
businesses, there would be a net loss. However, businesses would bring
with them higher-rate taxpayers, corporation tax payers, council
taxpayers and business ratepayers.
Though that income would not go to the Scottish Parliament, much of it
would go into the Scottish economy, as would the business expenditure of
the companies and the domestic expenditure of the directors and
employees.

WILDCAT'S Bedfellows has not been having a happy time of it. Styled a
musical farce, Dave Anderson and David MacLennan's Highland farago went
to England last week -- only, like The Tron's Dumbstruck, to fall prey
to the same critical mawling as its precedessor.
The Evening Standard called it plain ''silly', The Times ''tedious',
while the Guardian's reviewer, Lyn Gardner, called it a piece of
community theatre that should have stayed home.
Are the criticisms justified? And how is it that the venue's Nick Kent
and the Sunday Times's John Peter, both enamoured of the show when they
saw it on home territory, could have got it so wrong? I can only report
that sitting in the Tricycle Theatre last week, the cold chill of
cultural chasm spread over the audience like yesterday's congealed
porridge.
You could feel that, in its own context, playing to an audience who
recognised and appreciated the particular geographic and local colour,
it could have been a gas. In Kilburn, it sank like a lead balloon.
True, some of the humour, from down here, did seem pretty lame,
caricatures well past their sell-by date. I mean, linguistic
misunderstandings may very well be a current preoccupation of Highland
tourism employing chamber-maids from every corner of the EC, but even
Ray Cooney wouldn't dream of flogging sexual entendre quite so
single-mindedly. Nor did Lesley Robertson's supposedly jumped-up Essex
girl come anywhere near matching the real thing.
All of which was a shame, because the company themselves are patently
more versatile and multi-talented than perhaps this show allowed them to
be, while the cultural and political satire -- not least the idea of
presenting transvestism as a metaphor for New Labour and it's women-only
candidates -- was, on paper, well worth airing.
In practice, while it produced one or two well-appointed shafts about
Blairism's close approximation to Toryism, in these days of megastars
such as Eddie Izzard and Julian Clary, Alan McHugh's pleasant,
cross-gendered Tony Bland seemed merely misconceived.
On the other hand, Dave Anderson's blustering Nicholas Fairbairn
clone, Sir Christopher Vainwean, and Michael Mackenzie's drunken hotel
factotum and SNP arsonist, both boisterously, deftly, struck home.
Was that, I couldn't help wondering, because they conformed to certain
southern stereotypes? Whatever, one thing seems clear: some north of the
border humour simply doesn't transfer well. But then, neither,
sometimes, do American, French, Polish satires and comedies. And it's
worth remembering that John Byrne, Billy Connolly, and Rab C Nesbitt are
as huge south of the border as north, while the dark humour of Irvine
Welsh's Trainspotting rang bells with many younger audiences. All is not
lost -- just more judicious selection called for.

With the launch of a highly-acclaimed series the BBC has brought
together some of the finest acting talent around. An impressed ALLAN
LAING looks forward to the first play
A CONTRADICTION in terms it may be, but it is possible to enjoy a good
night in at the theatre. Television is no substitute for sitting in the
front row of a West End playhouse, munching your Maltesers, and watching
a drama unfold on a stage before your eyes. But it does come a close
second. Particularly when it involves some of Britain's finest actors
performing some of the world's greatest theatrical works.
This Saturday sees the launch of a new season of BBC2's
highly-acclaimed Performance series. No nifty camera work, no hi-tech
special effects. Just pure stage drama. You want actors? They've got
them in spades -- Zoe Wanamaker, Colin Firth, Ian Holm, Richard E Grant,
Paul Eddington, and Jane Horrocks. Writers? They've got them, too --
Shakespeare, D H Lawrence, Pinter, and Strindberg.
The season opens with a powerful production of Sean O'Casey's 1925
classic, The Shadow of a Gunman. It features Stephen Rea, James Ellis,
and Bronagh Gallagher. Oh, and Kenneth Branagh. Let us not forget
Kenneth Branagh, who has been tempted back to studio drama for the first
time in 10 years (which is, I suppose, something of a coup for the
Performance production team).
Set against the backdrop of the Troubles in 1920, when the brutal
Black-and-Tans spread terror through the Irish community, the play tells
the story of poet Donal Davoren (Branagh) and peddlar Seamus Shields
(Rea), two dreaming youths who are mistaken for IRA soldiers on the run
by the folk who share their dilapidated Dublin rooming house. Davoren
warms to the role of fugitive gunman with tragic results.
Branagh, whose last television role was in the 1987 adaptation of
Olivia Manning's Fortunes of War, describes the Performance style of
studio drama as ''a hybrid between theatre and film''.
''It's like nothing else. You do much longer dialogue scenes than you
would on film, and because you're surrounded by three cameras you are
always 'on'. There seemed to be many more people around me than I'm used
to. The concentration had to be quite different,'' he said.
Although born in Belfast, Branagh moved to Reading as a boy and, as a
result, missed out on exposure to O'Casey's work. As a young actor he
made up for the loss by watching several productions of the Irish
playwright's work performed by the RSC.
''I remember being very struck by O'Casey's ability to capture
acutely-observed characters from working-class life and by his
tremendous knack of moving from pure farce to high tragedy in seconds,''
Branagh said.
The role of Davoren gives him his first opportunity to act in a
southern Irish accent. ''I took some coaching i and recorded the part on
tape. But it was still a great comfort to know that there were Belfast
actors such as Stephen Rea, Bronagh Gallagher, and James Ellis around
me.''
Branagh believes the part reflected much of the dramatist's own
personality. ''I think it reflects to an extent O'Casey's own ambivalent
feelings about his calling and he is giving us a bit of self-parody. The
idea of the artist -- the poet in a working-class community -- was
looked upon with great suspicion; as if what he did was not considered
to be proper work. O'Casey could see how risible a character he might
appear.''
Branagh enjoyed working on the play, particularly since it was a task
of pure acting and did not involve either directing or producing. The
experience has also prompted him to consider taking on another major
Irish play.
''When I'm directing, I'm scared by other things and so it's good to
be reminded from time to time just how frightening acting can be. And
this was very bracing.
''It felt strangely comfortable to be surrounded by all these Irish
voices, and it's made me think that I should take on The Playboy of the
Western World before it's too late. I love the crack when Irish actors
get together and all the stories and the anecdotes which flow when
you're all hanging about,'' he adds.
Stephen Rea (whose more recent film credits include The Crying Game --
for which he received an Oscar nomination -- and Interview With The
Vampire) should know The Shadow of a Gunman off by heart by now. He made
his London debut as the innocent Tommy Owens in a Mermaid Theatre
production of the play and went on to play Davoren in a 1970s version
for the BBC.
''When you think that this was O'Casey's first play, it's an
extraordinarily mature work,'' Rea said. ''Often in his plays, the comic
characters run away with it and the comedy gets the better of the drama.
But in this, he has the balance about right. It's the least sentimental
of his plays and packs a terrific punch.''
Rea, on the strength of his movie success, is now one of the most
bankable actors around. But he remains modest and self-effacing. ''I
remember someone asking me if I thought that success can spoil you,'' he
said with a wry smile. ''And I replied that failure can also do some
damage. Perhaps it's my defective personality, but I've always worked
too much. I was lucky enough to hit America with the kind of impact you
can only dream of.''
Has this success led to an artistic compromise or a weakening of his
Irish roots? ''Why would I suddenly start doing things I don't believe
in? I haven't moved to Hollywood. I still make my home in Belfast, and
I'd hate not to be able to call in at the pub and join in the crack.
''I've always believed that you just work and that you shouldn't get
too uptight about career success. I've done some low-budget European
projects as well as Hollywood things because I liked the scripts, and
that's the way I've always worked.''

IN the claustrophobic sweatbox of the Citz stalls studio Stewart Laing
has staged a feast of suppressed carnality that convinces that the
essence of human relations has
changed none since Giovanni Verga wrote his verisimo tale of Sicilian
peasantry. Laing's realism begins with the conspicous smoking and
drinking of his characters after a day's work, billows through clouds of
chaff raised from the floorcloth in brawling and lust, and finds
temporary peace in a plumbed-in standpipe used to water bouquets of
gloriously scented lilies.
The sounds, smells, dust, and tears of the Mediterranean are expressed
against distressed blue walls and the fierce light of day or the gentle
candles of worship. Verga's characters are tossed between their own
sensuality and the demands of their simple Christian faith, and when one
woman, Pina, dares to challenge convention by setting up young Nanni
(Paul Albertson) with her daughter Mara (Patti Clare) in order to keep
him for herself, she is condemned as ''the devil in flesh and bone'', a
she-wolf.
This is a Carmen among an innocent and uncomprehending people. (The
operatic comparison is quite apt since Verga provided the story for
Cavalleria Rusticana and Puccini was preparing an opera of La Lupa when
he turned his attentions to La Boheme.)
An intensely physical production, marred slightly by the varied
accents of the cast, through it all is the intense vibrant presence of
Yolanda Vasquez as Pina. It is far too long since Vasquez appeared at
the Citizens' (seven years?) and she should be welcomed back with full
houses for a performance that defines anguish and passion in every flick
of the wrist and arch look.

INVITED to launch the SCO's winter season in Glasgow last night, Mark
Wigglesworth showed himself once again to be among the most arresting of
Britain's young conductors, with a flair for Viennese music that
asserted itself instantly in the opening performance of Haydn's 99th
symphony.
The play of woodwind tone, the bright, clear timbres, the horn and
trumpet sonorities, the sharp response to the twists and turns of the
audacious modulations bore the stamp of a true Haydn conductor, and of
one who could draw, for the most part, just what he wanted from his
players. Each movement contained things to delight in. The whooping
horns in the minuet had real Haydnish brilliance.
Yet it was not in this -- nor was it in Ursula Smith's serenely
stylish and deftly turned account of Haydn's C major cello concerto --
that Wigglesworth revealed the full scope of his talents. The climax of
a programme that was originally intended to include Brahms's double
concerto (deleted through the illness of the violinist James Clark) came
very definitely in a wonderfully responsive treatment of Schoenberg's
Verklaerte Nacht, its every sigh, whisper, and cry lucidly articulated.
Growing from silence and ultimately receding back into it again, this
was Schoenberg playing of the utmost sensitivity, its rich textures
rooted in a remarkable undertow of cello and bass tone. The case for a
chamber orchestra version of the music, as opposed to Schoenberg's fine
sextet original or Karajan's massed strings, was eloquently stated. The
passion of Wagner's Walkure and the sweetness of the Siegfried Idyll
were held in perfect balance.

Q. I like to take a small whisky every night, just before bed. My wife
always complains about this, and says it's not good for me. But surely
it couldn't do me any harm, could it? Otherwise, I don't really drink at
all.
A. If that's true, then you have nothing to worry about, sir. A small
Scotch per day amounts to just seven units of alcohol per week -- which
is far below the officially-suggested limit for men of 21 units a week.
But a word of warning: people who pour so-called ''small'' drinks at
home usually under-estimate how much they're giving themselves! So maybe
your wife should dispense your nightly dram in future. I'd guess her
measure might be slightly less generous.
Q. I am a busy executive, and can't afford to lose time off work this
winter. So should I get myself fixed up with the 'flu vaccination?
A. This isn't quite as simple a question as it sounds! ALL
immunisation jags can have side-effects, and it's wise to weigh these up
before deciding to have the vaccine.
Fortunately, in the case of the influenza injection, severe
side-effects are at present rare. But it can cause two groups of
symptoms which could actually make you ill enough not to be able to
work. These are:
* A feverish and 'flu-like illness, lasting up to 48 hours;
* More rarely, an allergic-type reaction, probably caused by traces of
egg in the vaccine.
On the other hand, if we get a bad winter with a lot of influenza, the
jag could be of great benefit to you. The choice is up to you.
Q. I have never been able to discuss this with anyone, but for some
years my wife has been complaining bitterly that I do not ''last'' long
enough in bed. This is making her very frustrated, and she is talking
about leaving me. Can anything be done?
A. Certainly! You have a condition called ''premature ejaculation'',
which is so common that -- according to some estimates -- about one in
10 males suffers from it. The fact is that these days, it's awfully easy
to treat, provided that both partners want to put matters right. If one
of them won't co-operate, the outlook isn't too good.
Basically, the treatment is a simple set of bedroom exercises, which
have to be taught to the couple by a trained therapist. Your GP may know
of such a therapist in your area, but it's often simplest for a couple
to begin by seeing a doctor at a Family Planning Clinic. Good luck.
Q. There's heart trouble in my family, so I've been advised to cut
down on fat. But I'm very muddled about what kind of fat to avoid.
Please help.
A. Virtually everybody in this country eats too much fat -- and that's
one reason why heart disease is so common. But the kind of fat that's
really important to cut down on is called ''saturated'' fat which you
mainly find in fatty meat, and in animal products like butter, cheese,
milk, and cream.
If I had heart disease in my family, I would definitely cut back
pretty drastically on red meat (especially the very fatty bits), and try
and eat more salmon and mackerel instead.
Q. I am 51, and I've recently noticed that I'm suddenly having more
difficulty passing water than I used to. What's going on.
A. Almost certainly, what's ''going on'' is that your prostate gland
is getting bigger. This happens to most males over the age of about 50.
I'll return to the subject of the prostate in a couple of weeks' time.
However, the suddenness of your symptoms does suggest to me that you
should go and get yourself checked out by your doctor this week.
* If you have a query about your health, write to Dr David Delvin at
The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. Dr Delvin cannot reply in
person, but will try to respond in this column. Your name will not be
published.

THIS new play by Nigerian writer 'Biyi Bandele shouldn't really work.
Telling the tale of the rise and fall of a self-made prophet in northern
Nigeria, it is structured around a series of alternating monologues
delivered straight out to the audience by the prophet himself and two
followers.
For most of Act Two only one actor is on stage and it is right towards
the end before the play's first exchange takes place. It's a form that
went out with the Ancient Greeks, and its effect is to take the drama
off the stage and, only if it works, into our imaginations.
Happily, in Polly Irvin's production for London's Wild Iris Theatre
Company, it does work.
Charmingly acted by Chad Shepherd, a convincingly charismatic prophet,
Adjoa Andoh, his cured epileptic disciple, and Akim Mogaji, it is made
up of big, beguiling, articulate speeches which are a gift for the
actors. But the real pull of the play is Bandele's exploration of the
simple foibles that lead a man to declare himself a son of god and his
compatriots to believe him. It's not that Bandele doesn't raise a
cynical eyebrow at the charismatic hype, more that his interest lies in
the largely innocent way it is brought about, and for that his play has
an endearing, wry, and very human charm.

IT began with a folk-like openness and simplicity, moved through the
harrowing trauma of emotional crisis, and ended in utter nihilism; sheer
blackness.
It's hard to separate the components from the Tchaikovsky experience
delivered -- uniquely, comprehensively, and, I think, consummately --
last night by the glorious St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra with
their principal conductor Yuri Temirkanov. Two concerts, four
symphonies, the emotional gamut, and some unforgettable performances,
both uplifting and heartbreaking. The single pity of the night is that
neither concert attracted a full house; this orchestra doesn't deserve
the sight of a single vacant seat.
Of the earlier symphonies -- number two in the first concert and three
in the second -- Temirkanov and the St Petersburg Phil made as much as
could be expected. The second is a beauty, though it can tire because of
its repetition. Temirkanov went to town, unveiling (as well as the
splendours of the music) his entire thesaurus of acrobatic gestures -- a
one-man show in addition to the symphony.
Number three is the oddball work in the collection, one minute
pretending to be Mendelssohn in its lightness, the next an academic
composer in its rigour. Temirkanov made it a showcase for the orchestra,
especially in its deliciously weightless Scherzo.
But the meat of the night lay in the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. The
former received one of the most intense and draining performances I have
ever heard. Heavy-lidded and desolate at the outset, it went into a
crisis of emotional tension, even in the slow movement, where
Temirkanov's ebb and flow of pace pushed it almost to the limit. It was
highly charged, it never let up, and it was supremely played. I don't
know about the rest of the audience, but I was emotionally shattered at
the end of it.
By the Sixth Symphony -- the Pathetique -- Tchaikovsky was at the end
of his tether; he had a week to live after its premiere. Temirkanov and
the St Petersburg Phil played it as the composer must have felt it. And
somehow, the physical strain, by now showing in the orchestra near the
end of a long night, didn't mar the interpretation; if anything it added
to the tension.
This performance was as black as hell. It depicted a mind emotionally
exhausted; even the big tune in the first movement, and the subsequent
explosion of rage, offered no consolation or release. The relative grace
and crispness of succeeding movements did little to lift the atmosphere.
And the finale heaved itself into existence like a heartrending, aching
sob, collapsing, at the close, into oblivion.
Temirkanov, Tchaikovsky, and the St Petersburg Phil. Unique. What an
experience.

IS denial of Beta Interferon to patients with multiple sclerosis
rationing of health care? If the decision is based on finance, the
answer is ''yes''. If it is based on the value of the treatment, the
answer could be ''no''.
As always, it is important to define what we are talking about. If we
do this in the debate over the ''rationing'' of health care it should
prevent some of the needless conflict and confusion highlighted only too
well by Beta Interferon.
Rationing of health care is the denial to a patient of treatment that
would benefit their physical or mental health, treatment the patient
wishes to have and which, in the doctor's judgment, is considered
medically appropriate. Unnecessary treatment, by which I mean treatment
that is of no benefit to the patient, is not included within this
definition.
Therefore, stopping such treatment -- or in the case of Beta
Interferon, if it is ineffective, not starting it -- would be good
medical practice and proper use of resources. It would not be rationing.
My understanding is that, as yet, the scientific literature does not
prove the case for Beta Interferon. I have seen only one peer-reviewed
paper which shows any benefit, and that in only a few cases. It has no
effect on disability. That is not the basis for its widespread use. It
is an indication for further study.
If it is shown later to be effective, then it must be given to those
in need, irrespective of cost. Failure to do so would, indeed, be
rationing.
It is important to distinguish between need and demand. What separates
the NHS from others is that it is a needs-led service, unlike much of
the private sector which is demand-led. There is a demand for Beta
Interferon. Whether or not there is a need for it depends on its
effectiveness. I understand the demand. MS is a terrible disease, but
widespread use of unproven treatments is not in the interests of
patients.
A decision on Beta Interferon will show the NHS at its best. In the
United States, which has a demand-led service, patients who can pay will
get it whether they need it or not. Resources will be wasted. In
Britain, however, the decision will be based on scientific evaluation
and clinical judgment. That's what allows us a universal health service,
free at the time of need.
As you would expect, I am bitterly opposed to rationing. The way the
current debate is going, we are in danger of accepting it without due
consideration. The more often the claimed need for it is repeated and
unchallenged, the more readily it is agreed.
As a result, we then accept that the Health Service cannot meet the
needs of the people. But we should not use our rejection of rationing as
the excuse for demanding dubious treatments.
Let's look at rationing in general. An important criterion of true
rationing is that there is no exit from the system. As such, there is
only one form of rationing in this country: transplantation. The need
for organs exceeds their provision, thus making rationing necessary.
If the NHS cannot provide, no-one can leave the system and move
elsewhere. Most rationing, however, does allow exit. We should be clear,
therefore, that when we talk about rationing in this country we mean
rationing in the NHS. Escape is possible for those who can pay.
Rationing is often justified by repeating the assertion that health
care is a ''bottomless pit'' and need will never be met. That is not so.
As I have pointed out, it may be true of a demand-led service -- with
unneccesary investigations and treatments, generated by the private
sector and popular beliefs -- but it is not true of a needs-based
service like the NHS.
We know the number of people who require hip replacements. The number
is finite. Demand is not bottomless. We know how many require hernia
operations. Again demand is finite. If we establish the extent of need,
we can then decide whether or not to provide the resources for dealing
with it.
We may not wish to provide these resources, and that would be
rationing. It would have to be justified politically, but it would not
be justified on the false premise that the need for treatment is a
bottomless pit.
Apologists for rationing maintain that, through waiting lists, we
already have rationing in the NHS. Not true. Waiting lists are not a
system of rationing health care, but of delaying it. It is an unfair,
arbitrary system that again allows people to leave it and receive their
treatment elsewhere.
There will be rationing in the NHS from time to time. Renal dialysis
was such a case. When this treatment was first introduced, it was
available only to a few, and quasi-medical reasons were given for
restricting its use.
This was, in fact, a form of rationing and was caused by the limited
service available at that time. But there is a difference between that
form of rationing and what is proposed today.
When the value of renal dialysis was established, the rationing was
eliminated by expanding the service. So, too, with other procedures,
where initial rationing is abolished and treatment made available to
all. What is now being suggested in many areas of health care is the
opposite -- a reduction in services with fewer treated.
There is also unseen and unrecognised rationing within the NHS. The
rates for operations such as cataract removal, prostatectomy, and others
vary across the country and social classes -- higher rates in higher
socal classes, lower rates in the lower social classes.
It could be that the higher social classes have some unnecessary
operations. It could also be that their needs are greater, although I
doubt that. What I think it does mean is that people in the lower social
classes have lower expectations and have rationed their own care. We
should be seeking to eliminate this.
Eventually, someone has to sit down with the patient or the relative.
They can even say that the treatment is of no value. They can also say
the treatment would not be in the best interests of the individual
concerned.
But I do not believe they can ever tell patients that the treatment
would be of benefit but cannot be given because of rationing. Let's make
sure patients with MS do not fall into the last category when there is a
proven treatment.

William Russell finds a comedy about comedians, a computer-age
thriller, an assassin adventure, gender dilemma, and a local gem on the
big screen this week
LAUGHTER and pain are as inextricably linked in comedy as in life, and
it is this that Peter Chelsom celebrates in Funny Bones, his diverting,
erratic, brilliant, flawed comedy about comedians and Blackpool. There
are too many loose ends and non sequiturs among the brilliance for
comfort, and the result is a curate's egg film, good in parts, which
Chelsom has difficulty bringing to an end. It looks suspiciously as if
the studio has been insisting on cuts.
Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt), son of America's favourite comic, George
Fawkes (Jerry Lewis in wonderfully abrasive King of Comedy mode) blows
his Las Vegas debut and, ashamed, runs away to Blackpool, allegedly the
Mecca of comedians, where he spent the first six years of his life with
his father.
He hopes to find the secret of being funny. He auditions lots of truly
terrible acts to see whether they possess it, including the Parkers,
Thomas and Bruno (George Carl and Freddie ''Parrot Face'' Davis), circus
comics who have not performed for years.
He accuses them of stealing his father's material, only to realise it
was George who decamped with their act also leaving George's wife Katie
Parker (Leslie Caron) pregnant with Tommy's half-brother Jack (Lee
Evans).
Tommy realises that, although he may not be naturally funny, Jack does
have dem bones. Around this ramshackle frame Chelsom has hung an amazing
collection of music hall jokes -- some old, some new -- performed in a
tacky to-the-life Blackpool full of fat ladies, comic policemen, pompous
local government officials, weedy wee men, and broads with busts
straight from a Donald McGill postcard.
One running gag, involving a pair of severed feet and corpses in Fylde
mortuary, is a classic instance of laughing at the ghastly to avoid
crying.
Caron makes a lovely mature vamp, undulating in a body stocking as
Cleopatra with a real asp, while Richard Griffiths, Terence Rigby,
Oliver Reid, and Ian McNiece flesh out the assorted postcard grotesques
perfectly. Lewis, who sparkles in Las Vegas, could never, however, have
been a Winter Gardens star, and the subjective nature of what is funny
sabotages the film. Lee Evans, very good as Jack, is a Norman Wisdom
clone when doing his comedy act which, intended to prove him naturally
funny, proves dire.
Funny Bones is a stunning, original film, but Chelsom, who made Hear
My Song, a hopelessly undisciplined director, needs to be more firmly
controlled if his unique and astonishing talent is to flower.
Every Hollywood actress has a frightened-lady movie in her career. For
Sandra Bullock, flavour of the moment, it is The Net directed by Irwin
Winkler, which looks at the increasingly dominant role computers play in
people's lives. If one is not in the computer one does not exist; if the
machine says one is a crook or a debtor de facto, then one is.
An expert on computer security systems, devoted to her keyboard and
take-away pizzas, Sandra receives a floppy disk from a suspicious
colleague which she takes, unread, with her on holiday in Mexico. There
she is instantly seduced by a devastatingly handsome Englishman, Jeremy
Northam, and has to fight off his murderous advances. He wants that
floppy disk. She escapes, has an accident, and wakes up in hospital to
find she has a new identity as a drug-taking prostitute.
Back home in America she is a non-person as herself, a real person
only as the prostitute.
A massive computer fraud involving the Pentagon, the CIA and all the
banks is under way. This highly-topical plotline is not sufficiently
developed, the action being restricted by the demands of the genre. The
lady behaves like all frightened ladies in movies -- stupidly. Similarly
Northam, like all cinema's ruthless killers, is thick as two planks,
and, while undeniably pretty, is only there because of Hollywood's
current obsession with casting English smoothies as villains. Miss
Bullock, feisty, funny and sexy, demonstrates she can carry a film alone
and Winkler has made a competent thriller, which hits its targets. Had
the basic idea been fully developed it could have been much more.
Italian stallion, Sylvester Stallone, takes on Spanish Don Juan,
Antonio Banderas, in Assassins, a testosterone-packed adventure directed
by Richard Donner. Stallone, all laid-back charm and lizard eyes, plays
an ageing hitman who, tired of his work now that the Cold War is over,
wants out. Banderas, twitching like crazy, is the homicidal boy who
wants his job. There is only one way to get it -- kill the older man.
Julianne Moore as an electronics experts gets involved in their battle
of not-all-that-clever wits.
Donner handles a basically daft tale expertly -- the car chases and
the shoot-outs are done with style -- the photography by Vilmos Zsigmond
is stunning, and the three stars deliver what is expected of them.
Stallone exudes the weariness of the old pro bored with the same old
routine; Moore, a very clever actress, makes bricks from precious little
straw; Banderas oozes the Latin-lover appeal of a Torremolinos beach
bum. But the denouement is so daft that the whole thing collapses with a
rather rude noise as the wind is blown out of the sails of the plot. As
in The Net, computers play a large part in the action since Stallone and
Banderas and Moore all communicate through their laptops with the same
mysterious employer.
Directed by He Ping, Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker, set in 1911
on the Yellow River in China, looks at sex, love, and gender. A
devilishly handsome, impecunious artist, Niu Bao, is hired by the
Master, the powerful boss of a fireworks firm, who turns out to be a
gorgeous lady brought up as a man. As head of the clan, a pretext of
masculinity has to be preserved for the sake of appearances. The artist
will have none of it, the lady decides she enjoys being a girl, and
honour has to be satisfied. The poor man fights a fireworks duel with
his rival, a jealous factory overseer, which ends with him blowing his
manhood to bits. But at least the lady is pregnant. Lots of
firecrackers, not much sparkle.
Bernard Rudden's Hunger Artist, based on a Kafka short story, hailed
by critics from all over Britain as one of the best films at this year's
Edinburgh Film Festival, won our film Herald Angel. It is worth seeing.

GOVERNMENT sanctions use of expensive treatment; doctors question if
it is value for money. Some mistake, surely, you may say; it's usually
the other way about. However, this is the situation raised by the latest
costly drug to compete for a share of the NHS budget, Beta Interferon to
treat Multiple Sclerosis.
Neurologists in the United Kingdom were largely united in their
misgivings during a satellite tele-conference on Tuesday night to
discuss the impending licensing of the drug in the European Union.
There is a wide belief among doctors here that the American trials of
Interferon Beta 1b, the version to be launched by Schering in a few
weeks' time, were not as thorough as they might have been.
The nature of the US health care system, a profit-making industry, has
helped to give rise to this suspicion. While this system has helped to
keep the US at the cutting edge of medical innovation, it is not
uncommon for doctors in Britain and other European countries to take a
more cautious view about some of them, and they sometimes carry out
their own, larger trials to corroborate American colleagues' findings.
When the cost of the new treatment could be #100m a year for a health
service already strapped for cash, the need for such corroboration might
seem more compelling. Yet attempts to mount such a trial were blocked by
the Government.
''There were various reasons for the trial being turned down -- we
were unhappy about prescribing a treatment like this in an uncontrolled
way,'' Dr Richard Metcalfe, a consultant neurologist at the Southern
General Hospital in Glasgow, said yesterday.
The issue generated much discussion between the neurologists, the
Medical Research Council, and the Department of Health, but Dr Metcalfe
said: ''There is no doubt the Government was under enormous pressure
from MS sufferers to make this drug available on the NHS.''
The trial showed that Beta Interferon -- which costs #10,000 for a
year's treatment for a single patient -- could help the one in eight of
the country's 80,000 MS victims whose illness follows a
relapse-remission cycle.
Now that the Government has decreed that the drug should not be
rationed, Dr Metcalfe and his colleagues plan to consult the West of
Scotland health boards who refer to the Southern's Institute of
Neurological Sciences.
''It has very serious implications for their budgets,'' he said. ''To
treat all the people in this area alone who fitted the criteria would
cost #4m-#5m a year.''
The options offered by Beta 1b and similar products in the pipeline
are welcome to specialists such as Dr Metcalfe, but it will mean some
hard decisions for the health service over the coming year.
He hopes that patients who receive the drug may yet be recruited to a
more thorough clinical trial, but licensing the drug will hamper this. A
proper trial would require a control group -- patients picked at random
to receive a placebo instead of the drug.
In effect, they would be denied an established treatment, something
that generally runs counter to medical ethics. This is why the British
neurologists were anxious to have a multi-centre trial first.
However, the situation may not be as bad as the huge prices being
bandied about suggest. Dr Metcalfe points out that switching from the
branded ulcer drugs to their generic equivalents would pay for
Interferon from the savings.
Providing the drug on a controlled study basis is also supported by
the British Trust for the Myelin Project, an Edinburgh-based charity and
campaign group aimed at funding research into MS and other disorders
affecting the myelin nerve sheath.
Secretary Diane McGovern, an MS sufferer who has been taking
Interferon Beta obtained privately, has campaigned during the past year
for it to be made available in Scotland on a named-patient basis, as has
happened to some extent in England. Interferon and other current
developments, she said, now offer hope of treatment for up to 30,000
patients.
''Their cost raises the greater issue as to whether society is
prepared to pay for them,'' she said. ''To avoid the rationing debate,
stop local inequities, and justify their use to society, they should be
rigorously monitored by the Department of Health, preferably in a
controlled study.''
Allan Macdearmid, 40, has used a variant of the drug -- obtained
privately from a doctor in London -- for a year, and has not had a
relapse in that time. ''That does not mean I don't have good days and
bad days,'' he said yesterday. Even on the good days he is effectively
confined to his home in Dyce, Aberdeen.
''I can't go out in a car,'' he explained. ''I am not sure whether
it's because of my eyes or the effect of the vibrations coming up
through the nerves, but after five minutes I am car-sick. There is no
point in going anywhere -- I am ill by the time I get there.''
He finds it hard to follow movement with his eyes -- watching football
on television, he depends heavily on the commentary and the slow-motion
action replay. Watching tennis is a waste of time.
In the 15 years in which the disease has developed, Macdearmid has had
to abandon his Shetland business selling, servicing, and programming
computers, as the disease took its toll on his hands and eyes, and it
became impossible to use a keyboard.
''The drug costs #8000 a year, and a one-hour consultation with the
doctor cost #250, but the only alternative was doing nothing. I have
been fortunate in having capital as a result of selling my house on
Shetland, but it won't last for ever. My family have offered to help,
but I would be reluctant to take this up -- they have their own children
to bring up.''
Macdearmid has yet to discuss with his NHS consultant the question of
having Beta 1b prescribed. It will, of course, make a difference -- it
opens again the possibility of his Norwegian-born wife, Bente, also 40,
and their two teenage children going on holiday to see her family in
Scandinavia.
But he is open-minded about the value of the drug: ''Looking back, I
had some relapse-free years anyway, so I can't be certain the drug is
the cause. If it is made available on the NHS I will certainly take it,
but I am unwilling to be involved in a campaign to make it available
because I don't know how beneficial it is.''

A SIX-YEAR-OLD Bosnian girl, seriously injured in a shelling incident
near Sarajevo in which three of her playmates were killed, is due to be
admitted to Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Sick Children today for
specialist treatment.
She was hurt three months ago and, with a shrapnel fragment causing
concern, a humanitarian airlift has been arranged through United Nations
medical authorities, because no medical facilities are available to
treat her in her own country.
The child, who is not being named, her mother, and nine-year-old
sister were due to be evacuated yesterday.
She will undergo an extensive assessment by consultants at the
hospital, to determine whether she can be treated.
Hospital trust chairman Graeme Millar said the reputation of the
hospital and its facilities in its new surgical wing were among the
reasons why it was asked to help the girl.
He said the resources of the trust would be pooled to ensure the best
possible assessment and care for the little girl.

There is one crime OJ Simpson must plead guilty to: wife-beating. Anne
Simpson reports on the unwanted message from the trial
THE CRIME
NO matter how often incomprehensible violence occurs nothing prepares
decent people for the kind of slaying which felled Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ronald Goldman, that hapless caller to her home on Bundy Drive.
What brand of aggression ignites such a killer? What turns a human
being into the barbarian? O J Simpson's acquittal for double murder
tells us many things about America, but one unwanted message reaches
everywhere. Stitched into his freedom there is the bleakly careless
signal that abuse against women counts for nothing; wife-beating is
okay.
In a voice reduced to a despairing whisper, one worker at a Los
Angeles refuge for battered spouses reflects that this verdict, however
unwittingly, condones a perversion old as man himself.
The woman's anger is not exclusively American. Our world understanding
of violence seems inextricably linked to a concept of expected and
tolerated male behaviour, and nowhere is this more evident than in the
combat zone of sporting culture.
''Football is warfare,'' says one player. ''You've been programmed to
be a fighting machine.''
But such explanation merely compounds the malady. Every year tens of
millions of women, throughout all continents, are beaten senseless by
husbands and boyfriends. In America alone around 1400 of these victims
die, and that kind of murder rate, at the hands of lovers, will never
diminish until society stops training men to believe that bashing women
is inconsequential.
''Physicality for men has meant male dominance,'' writes a feminist
legal scholar, CatharineMacKinnon. ''It has meant coercion and the
ability to subdue and subject the natural world, one central part of
which has been us''. In MacKinnon's book that two-letter word means
Women.
But misogyny is a difficult hatred to nail down since it often moves
slyly and, indeed, far beyond the perilous glamour of O J Simpson and
his kind.
Ironically, some men may claim that women incite their own downfall by
being involved with them in the first place. There are people who now
reflect that Nicole and her family were always gold-diggers, that her
very blondeness -- that Californian tennis-Wasp appearance -- allied to
OJ's blackness, fueled in him some primitive impulse for revenge.
But what is really being said here?: That men, given the means, have
the right to be barbarians? No woman, however reckless in her choice of
mate or personal behaviour, deserves to be physically and mentally
destroyed.
Faye Resnick, Nicole's friend, can never forget, she says, that this
particular victim insisted Simpson would some day kill her and ''get
away with it'' because he believed he was above the law. Certainly it is
true that, long before the murders of summer '94, fame and wealth had
bred in him a special sort of arrogance.
In the months before that terrible night police were summoned eight
times to respond to reports of domestic violence at Nicole's house in
the Brentwood suburb of Los Angeles. That radio-aired tape of her 911
call reveals a woman whose every living cell is filled with terror.
Yet in the context of those pleas O J Simpson was charged only once,
receiving a $700 fine and 120 hours of community service. Even though
that conviction was publicly known, America still hailed him as a hero.
After that acknowledged beating on New Year's day in 1989, he
continued to work for Hertz promotions and for the TV network NBC;
continued to be saluted by fans and media alike as ''a great guy'' and
role model for all.
And when he was chased by police cars along the LA freeway, last year,
commuters acted as if the record of that ugly thrashing didn't matter,
stopping their cars to wave to him and chant: Go, OJ, Go!
It may be difficult to think of a neck slashed to expose the spine as
belonging to that same category of spousal injuries as a face bruised by
a punch, but in death Nicole Brown Simpson is now a martyr for all women
whose torture goes unheeded until it is too late.
Her husband has walked free from a monstrous crime, but, along with
many others, someone is out there, pursuing an unpunished life of brutal
rage against a woman. Deep down, black and white America knows this. And
so does everybody else.

WESTERN Isles Islands Council is joining the campaign against Dounreay
seeking contracts to reprocess spent nuclear fuel which had been due to
return to the US, its country of origin.
Following yesterday's meeting of the council's environmental services
committee, council vice-convener Angus Graham is to seek a meeting with
a number of bodies to try to organise a campaign covering the Highlands
and Islands.
Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch, however, said in Inverness
yesterday that he was satisfied that the existing controls on Dounreay
were sufficient.
On Monday night, 52 fuel rods from Hann Meitner Institute in Berlin
were shipped into Scrabster in Caithness and taken on to Dounreay, with
reprocessing likely to begin in the New Year. Nearly 15,000 fuel rods
are stockpiled at 40 reactors in Europe and further afield awaiting
transfer.
Mr Graham said yesterday: ''It is only 84 miles from the Butt of Lewis
to Thurso, so this concerns us. Dounreay seems to be trying to bring in
nuclear reprocessing by the back door. It seems to me amazing that they
are now taking in nuclear fuels from other parts of the world to be
reprocessed, with all the problems it brings in terms of increased waste
and so on.
''That is all being done without official scrutiny, without any need
for planning permission, without any need for a public inquiry. We need
now to join together in the Highlands and Islands and have a concerted
campaign to have all these issues looked at in detail.''
Meanwhile, Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, said yesterday that he would be seeking assurances from
Dounreay's director John Baxter if the plant won more foreign contracts.
He recognised that jobs at Dounreay were affected but so were others in
different fields.
''Winning new contracts could have an upside in one respect but a
downside in another. For example, our clean atmosphere in this area
sells our fish, it sells our food, it sells our tourism. If this
business is going to go ahead, is it going to be prosecuted in
absolutely the safest way possible? That is the key. They have to
satisfy all of us in the Highlands,'' he said.
Mr Kynoch, in Inverness yesterday to launch a tourist initiative, said
later: ''I am aware that the current project is a small one, it is in
line with similar projects . . . and I have a great confidence that my
colleagues in respective departments who monitor these things are
clearly keeping close touch on it.''

A DRUGS crackdown by police in Fife has prevented cannabis with a
potential value of #500,000 from reaching the streets.
Operation Chopper has caught growers and dealers off guard and
uncovered six factories producing ''skunk'' cannabis in the last two
weeks. Hundreds of cannabis plants have been seized in raids on houses
and at least six people have been arrested.
Detectives, working closely with the force drugs squad, are remaining
tight-lipped on the reasons for their success but predict more arrests.
A senior officer warned that the pressure will be maintained until
they are satisfied they have curbed the recent trend of mass cultivation
of cannabis plants in home-based factories.
Detective Chief Inspector John Nicholson, head of Western Division
CID, said: ''We have had good success in raids over the last few weeks
and are now focusing our attention on other addressess.''
He warned: ''We are determined to stamp out this increasing trend of
commercial cultivation.''
Revealing that in some cases as many as 60 plants of the ''skunk''
variety were being grown using a sophisticated hydroponic system, Mr
Nicholson said: ''We do not believe anyone cultivating plants in this
way is doing so for personal use.
''They will be charged with possession with intent to supply, which
could lead to an appearance before the High Court and a custodial
sentence of up to five years.''
Meanwhile, drugs worth around #8m were recovered yesterday after an
undercover police operation in London.
Two million capsules of Temazepam were found on a lorry at an
industrial estate in Feltham. Two men were in custody last night
following the raid.
Police in London believe the drugs were destined for sale in Scotland,
however, Strathclyde Police said last night there was no evidence to
support this theory.
From next month, the rules governing the carrying of Temazepam will be
tightened following a pledge of action from Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth.
* A young woman from Saltcoats was jailed for 12 years at Croydon
Crown Court yesterday, for her part in an attempt to smuggle nearly
#1.5m worth of cocaine into the UK.
Liza Alexander, formerly of Mayfield Road, Saltcoats, was found guilty
of the illegal importation of more than 13 kilos of the drug from
Barbados.
The court was told she was one of six people stopped at Gatwick on
Christmas Eve.

THE VIEW FROM AN EXILE
Peg De Voe, a Californian management consultant who has lived in
Scotland for the past four years, gives her view on implications of a
stunning verdict. She moved here with her husband, Crawford Beveridge,
chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, and their two children, four
years ago.
I AM a news junkie. So it came as no surprise that Monday night the
first thing I wanted to do on coming home from work was to turn on the
television to catch the news.
The surprise came when I discovered the children already tuned into
the news. Of course! It was time for the O J Simpson verdict.
The dog needed to be walked, but that was going to have to wait. Much
as I hate to admit it, even I was captivated enough by this story to
hang around long enough to hear the end result.
I was concerned that Judge Ito would have to poll the jurors -- this
could take a while. But no, in two brief sentences, the not guilty
verdict was delivered, and I took the dog for her walk.
Not guilty? My mind was reeling. How can this be possible? Everyone I
had ever spoken to about the case, both here and in the US, believed
that O J was guilty. What was going on here? And what was I going to say
to my colleagues at work tomorrow when they ask me that very question --
How?
The murders were committed when Crawford was in California in June of
last year. He phoned just to check in. I was incredulous when he told me
that O J Simpson had been arrested for the double murder. We laughed
when we realised that all his own scheduled TV coverage was going to be
pre-empted by the O J story. But I was stunned.
O J had been one of my heroes. He was at USC while I was at the
University of San Francisco. He was admired by all fans of college
football -- probably the biggest star in the Pac-Ten conference and
later in the professional football league. It took the television
coverage of the laughable, straight-out-of-the-movies car chase to
convince me that he probably was guilty. And I haven't changed my mind.
My friend Sharon -- a Texan who has lived in Scotland for almost 20
years -- found a phrase that sums up what I now feel compelled to say
about this unbelievable verdict: not guilty is a long way from
innocence, at least under the American system of justice. Guilty? Maybe,
but not convictable. I now understand the existence of the Scottish
''not proven'' verdict.
Which brings us to the point of all this: what is going on inside the
American legal system? And how can the US hold her head high when
international opinion, both in private and in the media, is mocking a
system which can deliver such a verdict in light of all the evidence?
The media coverage of this trial has made it all but impossible to not
know how it was progressing. I was in California for six weeks this
summer, and was amazed to see how many folk actually would leave their
TVs on all day long, tuned to the live coverage. During the visit, the
issue of racism in the case was developing. So even if you didn't follow
the case by day, it featured strongly in the evening news almost every
night.
The coverage here has been light by comparison, but still there has
been enough to to make me realise that there is an inordinate amount of
interest everywhere in this case, perhaps because of the prominence of
the players, perhaps simply due to the normal morbid interest human
beings seem to have in each others' troubles.
But I also have this the sense from the press here that this is yet
another chance to watch the US get it wrong.
This is the second opportunity I have had to live abroad. When we
first married, we lived in Switzerland because of Crawford's work.
Although we have friends from all over the world, it was the first time
I had been exposed to living in a truly international environment. It
was also the first experience I had had with being expected to stand up
for and otherwise defend the US -- its role in world affairs as well as
how it managed its domestic policy.
I learned a lot from that experience -- as one of 300 million people,
all I can do is observe, vote, and hope for the best.
For many reasons, the US has assumed the unenviable position in the
world as the country other countries look to. Much 'new' and 'forward'
thinking seems to emanate from the US. The size of the US economy and
its use of a widely-spoken language have led it to have a dominance on
the global scene that perhaps is not appropriate to its relative age as
a nation.
The early development of the film and television industry in the US
has led to its pre-eminence in that field -- to the dismay of other
countries as they see their own cultures being Americanised at an unholy
rate. Of course, other developments feature: jet travel and the growth
of international business among others. But television, in particular,
has led to a set of images and expectations about America that are often
either wholly or at least partly untrue.
Our friends from Hamilton, Max and Pat, came to visit us when we last
lived in the US. One day we were driving through the Santa Cruz
mountains where we came upon a highway patroman with his rifle trained
on the occupants of a VW beetle. I nearly had a heart attack! Max and
Pat, with their TV-influenced image of what life is like in America,
ho-hummed and thought nothing of it.
We laughed at the time about our differing perceptions. But the truth
is that everyday life in America is not what you see on your TV screen
-- most Americans have not had a gun pulled on them. Most do not own a
gun, even though there are (stupid) laws that allow them to.
Violence is not a part of everyday life, but an everyday concern, just
as it has to be almost everywhere. But blood, violence, crime, sex,
scandals and screw-ups are what make for interesting stories, whether
printed or broadcast. So this is the image that America projects with
both imaginary and real life characters.
The O J case to me is an example of another screw-up in the US --
including lots of blood and violence. It helps to solidify the view from
abroad that the US cannot get it right.
One report in Tuesday's Herald said ''. . . in America the
imcomprehensible is possible''. But the verdict is comprehensible.
This verdict, unbelievable as it appears to be, has to be seen as a
compilation of a long list of issues. A jury of largely blue-collar,
mostly black, workers -- people who idolise the famous rich, especially
those who have made it big on their own.
A black hero who has beat the odds in a predominantly white milieu. A
system which requires that the jury must be sure ''beyond a reasonable
doubt'' for a guilty verdict.
A jury of 12 people who only a few years ago watched LA burn in
reaction to the acquittal of Rodney King's assailants.
An LAPD which has demonstrated in the past that it has racists in its
numbers.
Unlimited money to pay high-powered attorneys. Book deals to follow.
Television cameras allowed in the courtroom, pandering to voyeuristic
audiences curious about the high and mighty, now fallen.
For the record: I agree, it looks like the legal system there is
broken. Maybe it can be fixed. They could start by kicking the cameras
out, and by moving trials to venues where the jurors aren't in fear for
their own safety.
Unfortunately, much US law is built on precedent, so what has happened
in this case could lead to permutations of the same issues later. The
''money talks'' problem is a big one -- an accused with a public
defender instead of F Lee Bailey would probably have been found guilty
in this case. The problems are so pervasive that it makes me truly
wonder if it can be fixed.
I would like to believe that what has occurred here will be the
catalyst of change, but I see only the faintest glimmer of hope that
this is to be.
What leaves me feeling very uneasy is this question: if not OJ, then
who? LAPD has no other suspects.

AIRDRIEONIANS FC remained homeless last night after Strathclyde
councillors rejected proposals for a 10,000-seater stadium on a
green-belt site at Glenmavis, north of Airdrie.
As grim-faced club officials left the region's planning meeting
without comment yesterday, the consensus was that the club had scored a
horrendous own goal by allowing their former stadium at Broomfield to be
developed as a superstore without having planning permission for an
alternative site.
In contrast, the villagers of Glenmavis, who have consistently opposed
the plan which they fear will disrupt their community, were
''ecstatic''.
The chairman of their action group, Mr Ian Mitchell, said: ''Ours is a
small village. We have problems with very heavy traffic. A football
stadium in the village would have been the last straw.
''Some elderly people who have lived in the village all of their lives
had been saying they would move out if the stadium plan went through.''
The plan was rejected by eight votes to three. The region's director
of physical planning, Mr Robert Maund, had recommended approval ''with
the greatest reluctance''.
The planning chairman, Councillor Sam McCartney, who voted against his
director's recommendation, commented: ''I did not regard the
application, or the lack of a football stadium for Airdrie FC, as
sufficient grounds for departure from our green-belt policy.''
Currently the team is sharing Broadwood Stadium with Clyde FC, a
situation that is not popular with the fans.
In a report to committee yesterday, Mr Maund warned that the choice
lay between an approval in the green belt at Raebog Road and a refusal
which could result in the demise of Airdrieonians FC. This would also be
damaging to the local area.
However, the main strategic concern for the region's planning
department was the precedent which could be set by a club which had sold
its original stadium site to a superstore operator without having a
replacement site in place, then coming forward with a site in the green
belt as the preferred option.
An alternative site at Brownsburn was considered as a possibility but
stadium use has been ruled out by Monklands District Council, which is
hoping to promote a joint venture with the Walker Group (Scotland) Ltd
for a golf course, housing, and commercial development.
Airdrieonians have the option of appealing to the Secretary of State
over yesterday's decision. However, the Scottish Office has already
indicated that, because of the size of the structures involved, football
stadiums could not be regarded as appropriate developments in the green
belt.

AN unemployed man, who has volunteered to take vital aid supplies to a
Romanian orphanage, has been told by the DSS that he will lose his #46 a
week benefit when he makes the journey.
Mr Bruce Lindsay, 33, has had to sign off because the DSS will not be
able to contact him with job offers. Also, he will be outside EU
boundaries while delivering clothes and equipment and installing badly
needed lighting and fire safety gear in the orphanage near Podriga, near
the Ukrainian border.
His benefit stops when the aid party leaves on Sunday and he will
receive no money when he returns until a new application has been
processed and approved.
Mr Lindsay, a former theatre stage manager who retrained as a
botanical surveyor, said yesterday: ''The Government is always telling
unemployed people to take a positive attitude and join voluntary
projects and that's exactly what I've been doing.
''Now it seems I'm being penalised. I was stunned when I was told I
would have to sign off, particularly when you consider the fiddles and
moonlighting which some people claiming benefit get up to.
''The simplest thing would be to cancel the trip but that would mean
letting down the rest of the group and I can't do that. I sold my guitar
for #100 this morning but I've still got to pay bills for my flat while
I'm away and have something to live on when I get back.''
Mr Lindsay, of Hawthorne Road, Langlee, Galashiels, has protested to
his MP, Sir David Steel, who is taking up the case with the Secretary of
State for Social Security.
Yesterday, an Employment Service spokesman said: ''An individual will
be disqualified from receiving benefit for any day he or she is outside
the UK. However, they can export their UK benefit claim to another EC
member state if they go there to seek employment. In the case of Mr
Lindsay, Romania is not an EC member state. There are no special
circumstances which apply to aid workers.
''Mr Lindsay has terminated his claim and has been advised to come to
his local JobCentre as soon as he returns from Romania when he will be
issued with the relevant forms to submit a new claim. He may apply for a
social fund loan if facing short-term financial hardship.'
Meanwhile, a six-year-old Bosnian girl, seriously injured in a
shelling incident near Sarajevo in which three of her playmates were
killed, is due to be admitted to Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Sick
Children today for specialist treatment.
She was hurt three months ago and, with a shrapnel fragment causing
concern, a humanitarian airlift has been arranged through United Nations
medical authorities, because no medical facilities are available to
treat her in her own country.

THE SYSTEM
IN Scotland we have nothing to learn from the O J Simpson trial except
that our system is better. Indeed to turn a murder trial into a media
event is profoundly repugnant.
Law is about human dignity and dignity is not a media event.
Had O J Simpson been tried in Scotland the proceedings would have been
over inside a fortnight, and the top lawyers would have been paid #400 a
day at most. Enough for us; enough for justice.
We know that we are better than the Los Angeles lawyers, better,
quicker, and clearer. If we tried to act as they do our judges would
stop us and our juries would rebel.
In America they ask too much of juries. These American jurors served
the equivalent of a year in custody. With us, jurors are free to come
and go. They have to be secluded in America because they would otherwise
be subject to press harassment. To approach a juror is a crime in
Scotland.
How did the jury reach a verdict after only four hours? How did they
reach a verdict at all? Judge Ito did not, to use our own home-spun term
''charge'' the jury, although there had been 10 months of evidence.
Twelve ordinary people were left with 12 question marks over their
heads and no instructions as to how to go about the most grave civic
duty they will perform.
To a Scots lawyer this is the most shattering event in the trial.
I have always maintained there is no such thing as a dull criminal
trial, yet I suspect that in America they contrive them. The reason is
the presence of the TV cameras. I have refused to let any trial of mine
be televised. This American performance has confirmed all my prejudices.
We saw professional men and women prance and posture as though they were
at a circus.
They had none of the cold dedicated pursuit of justice which animates
and informs all our Scottish procedure.
The most interesting part of the trial for me was the spectacle of an
important police witness refusing to answer questions on a vital
question of credibility. In Scotland lying policemen, and there are
such, have no protection and in the interests of justice it is difficult
to see how any Crown witness should be given such a right.
It is incomprehensible to us that his refusal to answer questions was
kept from the jury.
I fear for justice in America, but I fear for it also in Scotland.
During the time O J Simpson was on trial I conducted many murder
trials in Scotland. Hardly any of them made the newspapers. It is wrong
that violent death and the subsequent trial should pass without public
scrutiny yet the American media circus is clearly not the answer. It
kills what it is there to protect.
Have we then nothing to learn from this monstrous event? I don't think
we have. It might be an idea to have some standby jurors for lengthy
trials. It might be better for us to scrutinise jurors more closely.
Was he guilty? Of course he wasn't. A jury has said so. But I suspect
it was the Los Angeles police, not Simpson who were on trial.
Would he have been convicted in Scotland? Who knows? One thing's for
sure. If the light of world publicity is ever shone on Scots law we will
do far, far, far better than the Californians.

A CAR stolen from a motorway service station and later found abandoned
is worth around #1m. The thieves settled instead for the trailer it was
being transported on, which is worth about #5000.
The prototype Renault Safrane, fitted with a revolutionary new engine,
was stolen early yesterday from a car park at a services area near
Gillingham, Kent.
Renault had entrusted the unique vehicle to Perkins Technology Ltd, a
division of Perkins Group Ltd, a leading manufacturer of diesel engines.
Transporting it from France to his company's headquarters in
Peterborough, the Perkins driver decided to spend the night in the
Pavilion Lodge Hotel, at the Pavilion service area on the M2.
He parked the trailer and its valuable cargo and went to bed. When he
woke in the morning, the trailer and the car had gone.
The police began an investigation encompassing the possibility that
the car had been stolen to order, leaving Renault, which was desperate
to get its prototype back, having to face the prospect that it had been
the victim of industrial sabotage.
Six hours later, a member of the public spotted the car, abandoned in
Gillingham town centre less than three miles from where it had been
parked. The trailer, worth #995,000 less than the car, was missing.
Renault had been coy about giving out too much information. One
officer said: ''We knew it was a car and we knew it was worth a lot of
money. But, other than that, we didn't know what to look for.''
Another said: ''It looks as if the thieves were after the trailer all
along. They can't have realised how valuable the car was. They must have
thought it was just another Renault.''
Mr John Chandler, a spokesman for Perkins, said the car was in one
piece and apparently undamaged. He expected it to continue its journey
to Peterborough.
''We will be consulting with Renault about the arrangements,'' he
said.

The jurors tell how the came to their decision as Ros Davidson
profiles Johnnie Cochran, the winner who played the race card
THE VERDICT
ONE juror in the O J Simpson case told her daughter she thinks Simpson
probably is guilty, but voted to acquit because the fiasco over a racist
investigator damaged the prosecution's case.
Juror Anise Aschenbach made the comments in a telephone conversation
with her daughter, the ABC network reported, identifying the daughter
only as Denise.
''She said, 'I think he probably did do it' '' the daughter said.
''I said something like, 'Gosh, you're kidding me.' And she said,
'No,' and she's crying. So I said: 'Why? What happened?'
''She said it was because there wasn't enough evidence. And I said,
'Why?' She said, 'Because of Mark Fuhrman.' ''
Fuhrman was a police detective who had found key evidence used against
Simpson but was revealed to have lied on the witness stand about using
racial epithets.
Another juror, Lionel ''Lon'' Cryer told the Los Angeles Times that he
and others on the panel kept finding holes in the prosecution case, and
concluded there were many opportunities for contamination of evidence.
''It was garbage in, garbage out,'' he said. ''There was a problem
with what was being presented to prosecutors for testing from (Los
Angeles police).''
Another of the jurors, Brenda Moran, 45, said: ''I didn't have enough
evidence to convince me that he was guilty.''
Moran said one of the defining features in the trial was Simpson
trying on the evidence gloves in the case. ''In plain English, the glove
didn't fit,'' she said.
Asked if the racial makeup of the jury of nine blacks, two whites, and
one Hispanic had anything to do with the verdict, Moran bristled and
said: ''I didn't come here to serve on a sequestered jury for nine
months to be really humiliated like that.
''We were fair, it wasn't a matter of sympathy, it wasn't a matter of
favouritism, it was a matter of evidence.''
Most of the jurors, however, seemed in no rush to explain their
decision as they returned home after nine months of restricted phone
calls, censored newspapers, and supervised family visits.
In the West Adams district, juror Beatrice Wilson returned to
Independent Square, an apartment building for senior citizens and
low-income disabled people, where the $180 monthly rent is the same as
the daily rate in the downtown Hotel Inter-Continental she had called
home since January 11.
The jurors comments seem to confirm at least two of the theories put
forward by experts for the acquittal. Analysts believe O J went free
because of one of four reasons: jurors were mad at the police,
underwhelmed by the prosecution, swayed by race or simply tired of being
confined.
The case also has another legacy. It has promoted Johnnie Cochrane, O
J Simpson's attorney, as one of the most influential black voices in
America.
Cochran, 58, has long been considered one of the country's finest
trial lawyers, with a skilled, showman-like court-room demeanour and
celebrity clients. But he is now arguably the single best-known defence
attorney in a society obsessed with crime and race. Cochran's inside
story of the trial might even command a book advance of $1m or more,
equalled only by Simpson himself.
''He is a national hero, especially among African-Americans,'' says
Tom Bradley, the former African-American mayor of Los Angeles. Indeed
when the US Congress' black caucus held a conference in Washington last
month, it was Cochran not retired General Colin Powell who received
several standing ovations and was plagued for autographs.
Cochran is also controversial for his recent use of National of Islam
bodyguards, alleged domestic abuse of former wife Barbara, and overblown
comparison of racist detective Mark Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler in his
closing arguments. Even so, his lawyerly skills and ability to charm or
command attention are unquestionable.
He successfully defended singer Michael Jackson against child
molestation charges. He was retained by white lorry-driver Reginald
Denny to sue the city after he was beaten during the 1992 riots. Along
with many landmark verdicts against police, he has also successfully
defended actor Todd Bridges over rape charges and the rap musician Snoop
Doggy Dogg over involvement in a drive-by shooting.

WATER executives were accused of ''profiteering and greed'',
''appalling mismanagement'', and ''unacceptable breakdowns'' in supply.
An emergency resolution called for the next Labour government to stop
the companies making ''excess profits at the expense of consumers'' and
ensure ''proper public control and accountability''.
Delegates from Bradford and Halifax set the tone. These areas face
24-hour stoppages in supply if Yorkshire Water deems it necessary.
Diana Jeuda, an NEC member, said: ''We have to make Yorkshire Water
take their responsibilities seriously. That means tackling their leaking
pipes, cleaning up the bathing water, and, above all, keeping the water
on.
''Their priority should be our water, not their pay.''
The resolution accused Yorkshire Water of a ''cavalier attitude to the
effects of their mismanagement'' and said cuts would threaten health and
hit public services and business.
Halifax MP Alice Mahon said drought orders nailed the lie that the
privatised water companies were more efficient than a publicly owned
industry.
She demanded: ''Why is it that we can send the most efficient military
machine to the Falklands and the Gulf and yet we can't pipe water from
one part of England to the next?''
George Pope, from Bradford West, said: ''Yorkshire Water can make 100
million gallons of water disappear from their pipes in just 24 hours.
That's 1000 gallons a second. That's one heck of a leak.
''It's big, it's very big. It's just about as big as the pay cheques,
the share options, the dividends being enjoyed by the fat cats running
Yorkshire Water.''
Maura Wilson, from Halifax, said Yorkshire Water was paying Halifax
residents #100 compensation for sleeplessness caused by tankers
travelling to fill the reservoirs.
''The irony is that water is going in at one end of the reservoir and
leaking away at the other. It's ridiculous.''

As Johnnie Cochrane (above), O J Simpson's attorney, celebrates
Patrick Brogan predicts more turmoil for the principals in The Trial of
the Century
THE VIEW FROM AMERICA
Washington,
THE saga continues. O J Simpson is home free, but just as the Furies
of Greek myth, the Eumenides, pursued the guilty, so will Simpson be
pursued by a relentless and wholly unfeeling public.
One of his friends speculated on Tuesday night that he would certainly
have to leave Los Angeles, and probably leave the country. Even his
personal safety is a problem: this is America.
A lawyer representing the family of Ron Goldman, the young man
murdered along with Nicole Simpson on June 12, 1994, spelt out part of
it: the family filed an unlawful death suit against Mr Simpson last May.
It has been in abeyance, waiting for a verdict on the criminal charge,
but now that he has been acquitted, the suit will go ahead.
It will be tried in Santa Monica county, outside Los Angeles, and the
lawyer said flatly that he expects to get a white jury.
Johnnie Cochran played the race card in the trial, now Fred Goldman
will play it back at him in the civil suit.
What is more, the burden of proof is less extreme: they need to prove
a balance of probability, not guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and they
can win with nine of a 12-man jury.
It is always possible that time will heal the wounds, and that the
Goldman family will conclude that it is better to mourn in silence than
to drag themselves through months of pain towards an uncertain verdict.
But the message so far is that the Furies are unappeased.
The Brown family is less bitter, or at least Nicole's parents are less
bitter. Their concern is for the Simpsons' two children, Sydney (a
girl), now almost 10, and Justin, eight. They are faced with the
horrible dilemma, either to hand over their grandchildren to a father
who, they believe, murdered their mother, or to start a custody battle
in which the terms of the fight would be made horribly clear to the
children.
Nicole's sister, Denise, is less afflicted with doubt. She told the
cameras that the verdict fulfilled Nicole's prophesy: ''She said O J
will kill me, and he'll get away with it.''
Nicole left a diary and letters in a safe box describing the many
incidents when O J beat her, terrified her and stalked her after they
split up.
The diaries could not be used during the trial, since there was no
proof of any of the allegations and Nicole could not be cross-examined.
So it was hearsay. But Denise threatened to publish them now, and if she
does they will certainly reinforce the beliefs of those who think
Simpson a murderer.
The trial cost him about $6m (the state of California spent at least
$4m). His personal fortune was thought to be about $10m (sports
celebrities are much richer now), and he faces further huge expenses in
the new civil trials -- and one may safely assume that his film career
is over and that he will never be paid to advertise Hertz car rentals or
sports shoes.
However, he can sell himself. The editor of one of the supermarket
tabloids, The Globe, told The Washington Post on Tuesday that Mr Simpson
could easily get $1m for exclusive photographs. He calmly listed the
pictures he would like: first, O J reunited with his children; next, O J
at Nicole's grave; next, O J revisiting the scene of the crime.
He can sell press interviews, and no doubt could demand huge sums to
speak to sympathetic groups across the country. The lecture circuit is a
very profitable field of endeavour: Colin Powell can get as much as
$60,000 for a single lecture. There are doubtless black churches that
will pay quite as much for O J.
The most tacky of all these merchandising efforts is an effort made by
some of the Simpson team to register his name as a trade mark. The
marketeers who are making a killing selling Pope T-shirts and mugs this
week could easily dream up materials for O J.
Pictures, autographs, maps, photos of O J and Nicole together could
all be sold. Mr Simpson is said to have made $3m from jail with a
ghosted autobiography and by signing cards bearing his picture. His
publisher is not interested in a sequel, believing that the market will
soon be saturated: there must be 40 books in the works already.
The Furies will haunt other people, too. The Los Angeles Police
Department was devastated by the verdict. There are only two possible
explanations: either the jury was so convinced that a black man in Los
Angeles could never get a fair trial, meaning that race relations are
almost beyond repair, or else the LAPD made such a mess of the
investigation that nothing it said could be believed.
There were certainly plenty of mistakes. The police climbed the fence
of Mr Simpson's house without a search-warrant. That document is held in
deep reverence by Americans, even though it is usually a mere formality:
the LAPD has tame magistrates who will sign one unread, in the middle of
the night, if asked. But it's all part of the sacred Bill of Rights.
There were many other errors in police procedure. They did not report
to the coroner until 10 hours after the bodies were found, and did not
bring in the medical examiner immediately.
They handled the evidence with a cavalier disregard for proper
procedure: one of the detectives carried Mr Simpson's blood sample
around with him for six hours before depositing it with the laboratory.
There is a strong tendency in America today to disregard such
procedural inadequacies as technicalities. Politicians regularly
denounce bleeding-heart liberals for caring about such things.
There are 1.5 million people, half of them black, in American jails
and the number is rising steadily.
President Clinton and Congress strongly support the death penalty, and
have passed a federal law mandating life imprisonment for a third
serious offence (many states already have that provision). America likes
locking people up and cares little for the niceties of judicial
restraint.
Most Americans will believe that those trivialities allowed a murderer
to walk free in this case -- or that the black community will not
convict one of its own for killing a white woman, as once white juries
in the South would never convict a white for murdering a black.
A New York Times columnist quoted a friend observing: ''When O J gets
off, the whites will riot the way we whites do: leave the cities, go to
Idaho or Oregon or Arizona, vote for Gingrich and punish the blacks by
closing their day-care programmes and cutting off their Medicaid.''
They will also try to ''speed up and simplify'' the court process,
meaning telling courts to be more indulgent to police 'honest''
mistakes. All this may be inevitable, part of modern America; but the
Eumenides unleashed by this case will drive the drama for months to
come.

<HEADLINE>Beckett plans treatment for the health service. Promise to scrap 'distressing'  mixed-sex hospital wards.</HEADLINE>

A LABOUR government would abolish mixed-sex wards in hospitals, Shadow
Health Secretary Margaret Beckett announced yesterday, in response to
the mounting unpopularity of a system which often leaves patients
embarrassed and distressed.
Demand for the change, which she believes could be introduced quickly
and at limited cost, is one of the most common themes in letters to MPs
from constituents who have been forced to share a ward with members of
the opposite sex.
In her speech to conference, Mrs Beckett challenged Health Secretary
Stephen Dorrell: ''Why don't you demand an end to mixed-sex wards, and
restore dignity to patients? Because that's what Labour would do.''
Under the terms of the Patient's Charter, patients must be informed
that they may be placed in a mixed ward, but are not offered an
alternative if this is unsatisfactory.
Mrs Beckett believes the proliferation of mixed-sex wards is the
consequence of the run-down in the number of NHS beds.
However, she is determined to address an issue which causes
embarrassment to people at a vulnerable time.
Mrs Beckett, a left-winger and former deputy leader of the party who
stood for the leadership against Mr Tony Blair, won an enthusiastic
standing ovation for her promise never to accept the Tory vision of the
NHS ''as long as I live and breathe''.
She criticised Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell for paying for private
health insurance to cover non-emergency treatment as proof that private
health care is incapable of providing a comprehensive service.
The Government, had brought back fear to the NHS, she said. ''It must
be a public service, centred on patients' needs, and not their ability
to pay. Today we are seeing the most dangerous attack on the NHS for
fifty years,'' she said.
There has long been a phoney debate about NHS funding. ''What everyone
must understand is that we always have a choice. We may not have an
unlimited sum of money, but we can choose where to spend it.
''The evidence from all around the world suggests that we get better
value for money from a publicly-funded universal health service. And
despite Tory meddling our NHS still delivers some of the best health
care and the best value for money in the world.''
She said a range of new ideas had appeared on the best way of
delivering efficient health care. ''But all these things require a
universal health service, based on people's needs, not their ability to
pay.''
Labour would undo the damage done to the NHS by, among other things,
restoring dental care on the NHS and banning tobacco advertising, Mrs
Beckett said. She pledged to renationalise the assets of NHS trusts that
have not been completely privatised.
Opinion polls showed Labour was trusted on health: ''As we seek that
trust, we say to our fellow citizens -- not in arrogance but in all
humility -- that if you place your trust in us to modernise and to
renew, not just our health service, but our country and our society, we
shall strive to be worthy of that trust.
''The choice is real. It is fundamental. It's in your hands.''.
Mrs Beckett was followed in the health debate by Mr Rodney
Bickerstaffe, leader of the health workers' union Unison, who told
delegates the Government was guilty of allowing patients to die
unnecessarily, of tolerating profiteering and of allowing the NHS to
decay.
Referring to the O J Simpson trial he added: ''There's no way this
Government would be found not guilty of the charges against it.''
He praised NHS workers for their devotion and ''goodness''. He
accepted Labour leader Tony Blair's warning that a Labour government
would not always be able to say yes to demands for pay increases, but
added: ''We can't keep grinding them down. When you come into your
kingdom, Tony, remember them, and say yes.''
Jean Goodhand, a nurse for 30 years, from Derbyshire North- East, said
old people in particular were worried about the NHS.
''It breaks my heart to say it, but the health service can no longer
be relied on,'' she told delegates.
''We used to have time to really care for our patients. But the Tories
have turned the NHS into a bureaucratic nightmare.''
Dr Doug Haysmith, of the Socialist Health Association, and prospective
parliamentary candidate for Bristol North-West, warned: ''One more
election victory for the Tories and our NHS will become a privatised
two-tier system driven by profit instead of by need.''
Life expectancy for some people in Britain had worsened for the first
time in 50 years.
''These figures are a disgrace to a civilised society,'' he protested.
''We desperately need a Labour government to begin to change them.''
The leadership's health policy was overwhelmingly endorsed by
delegates on a show of hands.
Other successful motions included one to replace the NHS internal
market and GP fundholding with a co-operative framework for
commissioning health care, and to make NHS Trusts more representative of
the local community and more democratic.

A GROUP of American journalists were in Glasgow yesterday as part of a
European study tour. Duncan Black and Cameron Simpson asked them how
they felt about some of the fundamental questions raised by the -- the
racial divide, the American justice system, media coverage and. . . did
he do it?
THE racial tensions which have been highlighted by the O J Simpson
trial are a problem which affects not just Los Angeles but the whole of
the USA, according to Bill Bishop, associate editor of The Lexington
Herald-Leader in Kentucky.
He said: ''A year ago a black kid in our town was killed accidentally
by a policeman. That was an incident which showed the amount of racial
division we had. Initially, there were some problems on the street.
''But later the white community, the business community and the black
community all admitted that we had a problem. In a way, we have come
further than LA in that respect. We have admitted that we have got this
terrible, long-standing problem that we do not know how to solve.
''These divisions play up in every issue where race is a factor.
Nationally, 80% of white people thought O J was guilty and 80% of black
people thought he was not guilty.''
The intense media attention paid to every step of the courtroom
proceedings in the O J Simpson trial has raised concerns about the
credibility of the American justice system itself, as well as the
desirability of such saturation coverage.
Mr Bishop said Americans had already been worried about the US system
of justice before this affair. ''There is a general distrust of civic
institutions in the States and that runs across newspapers, Government,
and large business.''
And Mr Bishop's own personal verdict on O J Simpson? ''I think he did
it. They presented a lot of evidence. But I am not surprised by the
verdict. I think that in LA there is enough distrust of the LA police
that it is not surprising at all.''
David Horst, a business and labour reporter with the Appleton
Post-Crescent in Wisconsin, believes the future is bleak for Simpson
despite the acquittal.
''He will now slip into a secluded existence. He won't be a
sportscaster again. The networks won't want to take the gamble on that.
His reputation has been harmed too much. There are still too many people
who think he did it.''
The case had been given saturation coverage in the US. A morning
television news show called Today had led with the story more often than
not, ''to the point of excess, I thought.''
''My own paper -- we're in the middle of the country in the Great
Lakes area -- was a little more disconnected and the case did not make
page one every day.''
The reactions to the verdict were very dependent on the colour of your
skin. ''So in a larger area with many blacks such as Milwaukee there
will be many more celebrations than in our area -- we have a very small
black population, less than one per cent -- where most people were
convinced by the evidence and would be disappointed with the justice
system.
''The strongest opinion I heard during the trial was 'I think he's
guilty but he will get off' because he has spent so much money on
attorneys.''
Innocent or guilty? ''For myself I found the evidence very
convincing.''
Lynn Olson, a senior editor with Education Week in Washington DC, is
that rare species of American -- one who didn't follow the trial from
day to day, despite being on sabbatical.
However, when it came to the verdict the answer was easy. ''The
verdict will go down well in Washington. There is a lot of support for
him in the city because we have a very large African/American
population.''
The verdict itself would, she believed, have little effect on race
relations.
The media, she thought, had gone overboard. ''The coverage of the case
has been just too much.
''As for the future of OJ Simpson I think he will probably sell many
more copies of his book.''
0  Innocent or guilty? ''I was probably one of the few people who
didn't follow the case on a daily basis. My gut feeling is that we will
never know if he did it or not.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night put forward plans to encourage
lawyers to do free legal work for the less well-off.
The scheme would help people who are not poor enough to qualify for
legal aid but not rich enough to afford proper legal advice.
''Responsibility to the community applies from top to bottom of
society,'' said Mr Blair, a former lawyer.
''I know as well as anyone that people feel remote from justice.''
In April, Mr Blair's barrister wife Cherie was one of eight women
among 71 new QCs and it was estimated she could earn up to #250,000 a
year.
Labour Party sources said her legal chambers already does work of the
type envisaged in the party leader's proposals, which are part of his
drive to find ways people can work for the benefit of the community.
The work, in which Mrs Blair had been fully involved, included
providing legal opinions for charities.
Mr Blair has asked Labour legal affairs spokesman Paul Boateng to open
talks with the Bar Council and the Law Society about setting up a
special unit to co-ordinate and encourage voluntary work.
Lawyers and companies would volunteer to work a certain number of days
a year in law centres or Citizen's Advice Bureaux. Big City firms could
instead give a cash equivalent or sponsor a full-time worker.
Unlike in the United States, where some states enforce the scheme with
penalties, Labour believes the British version should be voluntary.
Eligibility for legal aid has fallen since 1979 from 79% of the
population to 48%, says Labour.
Mr Boateng today will unveil proposals for extending access to
justice.

PRAGUE: Four Czechs have been charged with at least six murders after
police found the remains of victims dissolved in acid dumped in barrels
in a reservoir. Investigators said the accused had murdered at least six
and as many as 10 people over the last four years in what appeared to be
contract killings. The Czech underworld has been growing in tandem with
a private enterprise boom which began after the end of Communism in
1989.

CONFERENCE voted unanimously to condemn Shell's wish to dump the Brent
Spar oil platform at sea. It committed a Labour government to ensuring
that disused oil installations be dismantled on land.
Delegates agreed without a vote to accept a motion from two Scottish
constituencies which criticised the Government for backing Shell. There
were claims that on-shore disposal would create jobs for the Highland
economy.
Mr David Stewart, of Inverness East, Nairn, and Lochaber constituency
party, said the oil companies were damaging the environment for profit.
Shell achieved a turnover of #130bn last year, he said. ''They get
filthy rich while we just get filthy.''
Ms Elaine Thompson, representing Aberdeen South, disputed the oil
industry's claim that on-shore dismantling was environmentally more
risky and expensive.
She said oil companies in Aberdeen had the technology and skill
necessary to carry out the work. It was a question of ensuring that they
were prepared to pay. ''The only thing we want to dump is the Tory
Government at the next election,'' she said.
The motion declares: ''Conference recognises that valuable employment
opportunities could be created, particularly in the fragile economy of
the Highlands and islands, by dismantling and recycling oil rigs: some
360,000 man hours as opposed to 52,000 to dump.''
Shell had intended to dump Brent Spar in deep water in the North
Atlantic. But concerted opposition from environmental groups and
European governments, who claimed its contents would damage the sea-bed,
forced the company to back down in June, despite the full support of the
British Government.
Brent Spar is moored in a Norwegian fjord pending a decision on its
future.

Canberra
AN Australian study has found computer games may bring families closer
together, confounding popular perceptions the games turn players into
anti-social loners.
The national government study found some evidence that computer games
encouraged joint family activities.
''Computer games have become an important part of family life in the
1990s, and it is reassuring to know that there does not appear to be any
scientific basis for the fears held by many parents about the impact of
games on young people,'' said Attorney-General Michael Lavarch.
''No link has been found between aggressive behaviour and game play in
the home, and there is no indication whether a limited correlation
between game play in arcades and aggression is due to the games or to
the arcade environment.
''Playing computer games also appears to encourage young people to
confront challenges and improve skills, with some studies indicating
improvements in cognitive, perceptual, and social development.''
The study also said images of games-addicted teenagers glued to their
computer screens were off target, with most children spending more time
reading or watching television.
''Genuinely addictive game-play is rare,'' Lavarch said.
However he warned against regarding the study as conclusive, saying it
was difficult to draw firm conclusions from the limited research
available.
The study was prepared for the government's Film and Literature
Classification Board.--Reuter.

Alexandria
FRENCH archaeologists today recovered a Graeco-Roman relic that had
been submerged for at least 1500 years in the waters of the
Mediterranean at the site of the ancient Pharos Lighthouse -- one of the
Seven Wonders of the World.
Now they plan to save another 30 pieces from the seabed off
Alexandria, including what they say are two granite blocks from the
Pharos itself.
The huge stucture collapsed in an earthquake in the fourteenth
century.
After three hours of coping with a high swell today French and
Egyptian divers finally manoeuvred the red granite torso of a young
woman on to the hook of a crane, which then deposited it at the feet of
Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosni as a crowd clapped and cheered
from the quayside.
''It's the breast of a female, very beautiful,'' said Hosni.
The Pharos, a monumental lighthouse built around 280 BC and standing
330ft high, lit the entrance to Alexandria harbour for centuries, but
archeologists have never been able to identify positively any remains.
Jean-Yves Empereur, the French head of the recovery mission, said:
''Before we had only some representations of the Pharos in mosaics, in
paintings, and on glass. Now we have pieces of the lighthouse itself.''
He said the piece of statue raised was probably a goddess or queen,
but it was difficult to identify it at this stage.
The other pieces chosen for retrieval from where they are lying in
20ft of water include sphinx figures, bases and capitols of columns,
sections of obelisks, inscribed blocks, and a statue of the goddess Isis
who had a temple in the area.
Greek rulers brought some of them from the much older city of
Heliopolis, near modern Cairo.
Empereur said there were no plans to retrieve large granite blocks
thought to be from the Pharos, some of which weigh 75 tonnes, despite
their possible importance in studies of the lighthouse.
Once all 30 pieces reach dry land they will need to spend at least six
to eight months in water of gradually diminishing salinity before they
are ready for exposure to air.--Reuter.

Tokyo
THE doomsday cult guru charged with murder in the nerve gas attack on
Tokyo subways has confessed to that and other killings, according to
news reports today.
However members of the Aum Shinri Kyo religious cult said that leader
Shoko Asahara's confession had been forced.
Police refused to comment, but the cult and some reports said the
confession was not strong enough to be admissible as evidence.
Asahara has been charged with masterminding the March 20 subway attack
that killed 12 and sickened 5500. Police believe cult members carried
out the attack to fulfil his predictions of doom.
Asahara has previously denied involvement in the gassing.
He is also charged in a nerve gas attack in central Japan last year
that killed seven people; with directing the 1989 murder of an anti-Aum
lawyer and his family; and in the murder last February of a man who was
helping his younger sister try to leave the cult.
''In each case I gave the order and group leaders carried it out,''
Asahara was quoted telling investigators in a written confession in a
report on Japan's public television network, NHK.
Almost immediately, however, the cult drafted a hand-written statement
quoting Asahara's lawyer as saying the confession had been forced and
would be inadmissible in court.
The cult said Asahara signed a written confession after being told
that the group may be forced to disband because authorities are
considering enforcement of a seldom-used law against government
subversion.
The Tokyo Broadcasting System quoted Asahara as saying: ''I submit my
unconditional surrender,'' but added that his confession was did not
appear concrete enough to be used against him.
Signed confessions almost guarantee convictions in Japan, and
obtaining them is a standard tactic of public prosecutors, who work
closely with police. They are one reason for Japan's conviction rate of
99% in cases which go to trial.
Legal experts have predicted Asahara's trial, to start October 26,
could take years if Asahara insists on his innocence. If convicted, he
could face the death penalty.
While most of the cult's leaders are in jail, seven fugitive members
are still being sought on suspicion of involvement in the subway attack
and other crimes.
Police were today reported to be examining sodium cyanide found at an
abandoned mountain campsite of one of the fugitives, Satoru Hirata, to
determine if it matches that used in an attempted gas attack May 6 in
one of Tokyo's busiest train stations.
A burning bag of the chemical was doused in a lavatory before its
fumes could combine with an adjacent bag of chemicals and release enough
cyanide gas to kill thousands.
Some fear the fugitives may attempt similar attacks when Asahara's
trial begins.
Cult spokesman Fumihiro Joyu said before the reports of Asahara's
confession that the guru had asked the fugitives to turn themselves in
to police.--AP.

Singapore
A BRITISH fugitive on trial in Singapore accused of murdering and
dismembering a South African tourist has confessed to killing him, a
court was told today.
John Martin Scripps said he hit the victim, Gerard Lowe, with a hammer
after Lowe touched him on the buttocks in the hotel room they were
sharing.
''I am not a homosexual and at that time it appeared to me Mr Lowe was
a homosexual. I freaked out,'' Scripps said in a confession to police
that was given as evidence in the Singapore High Court.
Scripps's arrest on March 19 uncovered a trail of alleged
international murders. He is charged with a double murder in Thailand
and has been linked to the murder of a British tourist in Mexico and
another death in San Francisco.
Scripps said he used a 3lb camping hammer to hit Lowe several times on
the head until he collapsed on the floor.
''I then panicked,'' he said. ''My right hand was covered with blood.
Everything happened so quickly.''
Scripps, 35, said he visited a British friend at another hotel and
paid him to clear up the mess. ''Later my friend returned and told me
that there was nothing to worry about as he had got rid of Lowe's body
by throwing it into a river. On returning to my hotel room, I found
everything neat and tidy.''
Police said Scripps was asked to identify the friend and replied: ''I
cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family
back in Britain.''
He is accused of killing the 32-year-old South African brewery design
engineer in Room 1511 of the River View Hotel on March 8 or 9.
Lowe's dismembered body parts were found floating on March 13 and
March 16 in black plastic bags.
However Scripps, a convicted drug trafficker who went on the run from
a British prison during home leave in October last year, denied cutting
up the body.
If convicted of murder, Scripps faces the gallows with a mandatory
death sentence. The defence will apparently try to reduce the charge to
manslaughter by bringing in the homosexual angle to get a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment.
Since the trial began on Monday, the prosecution has built its case on
testimony by a British prison caterer who said Scripps attained
considerable butchery skills while working in a prison kitchen in 1993.
A government pathologist has testified that the way Lowe's body was
cut up indicated that only a doctor, a vet, or a butcher had dismembered
it.
Lowe's widow, who took the stand on the first day, said her husband
was not homosexual and disliked gays.
In his confession, Scripps said knives and a hammer found in his bag
were for camping, while a stun-gun and a can of mace were to scare away
animals.
The beginning of his confession matches with the police version of the
events: Scripps and Lowe met at the airport and agreed to share a room.
He also confessed to using forged passports, tampering with passports,
and misusing Lowe's credit cards.
After the killing, Scripps went to Thailand, where he is alleged to
have killed Sheila Damude, a 49-year-old schoolteacher from British
Columbia, and her son, Darin, 23. He returned to Singapore on March 19
and was arrested.
The trial continues.--Reuter/AP.

<TEXT>
A GERMAN court yesterdayapproved the extradition of Mr Nick Leeson to
Singapore for trial over the #860m collapse of Barings Bank.
The former trader's lawyers immediately announced that they would
appeal to Germany's federal constitutional court, a process which could
delay extradition for up to a year.
The Frankfurt regional court approved extradition on 11 of 12 charges
of fraud and forgery, ironically throwing out the original charge of
forgery which was used to hold Mr Leeson when he was arrested seven
months ago.
Only a government decision in Bonn is now needed for 28-year-old Mr
Leeson to be put on a plane to Singapore for a no-jury trial and the
prospect of up to 14 years in the notorious Changi jail.
However, a justice ministry spokeswoman said they would not normally
proceed with extradition while a case was being considered by the
constitutional court.
Mr Leeson's British solicitor, Mr Stephen Pollard, said: ''The
reasoning of the German court appears in various respects to be
inconsistent and wrong in law. There are clear grounds of appeal against
the decision to extradite, in respect of at least eight of the remaining
charges.''
However, Frankfurt public prosecutor Hans-Hermann Eckert said the
chances that Mr Leeson would not now stand trial in Singapore were
''very small''. He expected Mr Leeson to be extradited in mid or late
November -- a few months later if the constitutional court took up the
case.
Mr Eckert said the court had considered Singapore's legal standards
and had received a report from the German embassy. ''These standards
give the certainty of a fair trial before the Singapore court,'' he
said.
Labour MP Denis MacShane, who has campaigned for Mr Leeson to stand
trial in Britain, said Amnesty International had criticised Singapore's
human rights record and the International Commission of Jurists had
criticised its courts' lack of independence from the executive.
''I will be writing to the Foreign Secretary, asking for a formal
British assessment of human rights in Singapore,'' he said.
Tory MP Tristan Garel-Jones, who represents Mr Leeson's family in his
Watford constituency, said the Home Secretary should seek his
extradition to Britain to face charges brought by Barings bondholders
who lost #50m in the bank's collapse.
He said he understood the Serious Fraud Office, which announced last
month it would not seek Mr Leeson's extradition, was seeking to take
over the case and drop it.
''They would have some serious explaining to do as to why the real
victims of this crime, real people who have lost real money, should not
be allowed to seek justice in the British courts when the charges
they're laying are more serious and substantial than the technical
charges the Singapore authorities are laying,'' he said.
Last week, the bondholders obtained summonses against Mr Leeson for
three offences of deception and five of false accounting, carrying
maximum sentences of 10 and seven years.
Mr Leeson is expected to have the chance to discuss the implications
with his wife, Lisa, today, when she is due to make her regular weekly
visit.
She has said that, if he is jailed in Singapore, she would be able to
visit him only once a month at most because of the cost of air fares.

Munster
A GERMAN court sentenced a British soldier to 14 years in jail for
murdering his German wife with a hand grenade in the bedroom of their
home.
The court in Muenster, western Germany, found 30-year-old Lance
Corporal Phillip Eddowes guilty of killing his wife Anke, 28, at their
home in the town of Osnabrueck out of jealousy after she told him she
wanted to leave him.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence but Eddowes' lawyers had
argued he should be found guilty of accidental killing, carrying a
maximum five years.
Prosecutors alleged Eddowes had planned to kill his wife by detonating
the grenade after locking her into their bedroom.
However the soldier said he reacted badly when his wife told him she
wanted to leave him. He told her he could not live without her,
producing the grenade to make his point. He said a violent argument
ensued and as they fought, the grenade exploded.
He lost an eye and a hand in the blast.
Eddowes, of Downham Market in Norfolk, said he had found the grenade
while cleaning out a tank during the Gulf War and decided to keep it.
Eddowes, who also served in Bosnia, was in the process of leaving the
army but was assigned to the 32nd Engineer Regiment near Hanover at the
time of the murder.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry told of death during hip surgery</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976044310</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CONSULTANT yesterday
denied that an elderly woman who died from a heart attack during an
experimental hip operation was poorly informed of the health risks
involved.
He also claimed that the risks of the pioneering treatment -- aimed at
reducing the chance of a second fracture to her hip -- were less than
those of a complete hip replacement.
Orthopaedic surgeon Professor Richard Porter told an inquiry into the
death of Phyllis Moffitt, 70, that the procedure involved injecting a
ceramic paste to strenghten the hip.
The inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court had earlier heard that Mrs
Moffitt died on the operating table at the city's Woodend Hospital in
August last year.
A post mortem examination revealed that she had died of a heart attack
after being given a sedative to ease discomfort during the operation,
which was conducted under local anaesthetic.
The operation was part of an experimental project by an Aberdeen
University-led research team, which had earlier sought volunteers. Since
Mrs Moffitt's death, the project has been suspended.
Professor Porter, a member of the research team, said: ''I have done
more than 1000 hip replacements and never had one patient die on the
operating table.
''What we were doing was a lesser procedure than that. If there was a
significant rate of mortality associated with the procedure, I would not
wish to have been associated with it.''
Professor Porter stressed that the procedure had passed two medical
committees at the Scottish Office and one in Aberdeen, as well as the
hospital's ethics committee.
He denied that an apparent difference in risk assessments on
information sheets issued to patients, during the early stages of the
project and later on, was likely to mislead them.
A statistic in the first sheet said that women who had already
suffered a hip fracture had a one in 10 chance of breaking the other hip
in the next two years.
But a later sheet, the one sent to Mrs Moffitt, had been altered to a
one in five chance over four years -- exactly the same risk.
The hearing was adjourned until Monday.

Pensacola
HURRICANE Opal raced toward the coastlines of Florida and Alabama
today with howling winds of 125mph, unnerving residents with the
prospect of the season's third Gulf Coast hurricane.
Tens of thousands of people from Mobile, Alabama, to Panama City,
Florida, fled their homes, causing traffic jams up to 10 miles long.
As Opal's outer bands licked the Florida coast, the storm spawned a
tornado that killed a man in a mobile home in Crestview. Last weekend,
Opal's heavy rains killed at least 10 in two Mexican states.
1 Florida officials gave up trying to evacuate residents from coastal
areas and urged people to shelter in their bathrooms.
''We gave up what was a futile attempt to evacuate because Opal was
moving five times as fast as traffic was,'' said John Teelin of the
Escambia County Emergency Management office.
The governors of Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida declared states of
emergency and activated their National Guards. In Washington, federal
disaster teams were standing by.
Opal surprised forecasters by growing rapidly from a minimal hurricane
yesterday to a dangerous Category 4 storm. Its maximum sustained winds
briefly surpassed those of deadly Hurricane Andrew, which devastated
South Florida in 1992.
Residents of the Florida Panhandle braced for what may be the third
hurricane of the season after Allison and Erin.
''Houses are going to be blown down and people are going to die. We're
leaving town and I suggest you do the same,'' said Keith Cooper of
Pensacola as he, his wife, and three children loaded their car.--Reuter.

Paris
VETERAN mercenary Bob Denard freed the Comoran president today, ending
a six-day coup, after French troops landed in the Indian Ocean islands.
''I have no regrets,'' said the 66-year-old French soldier of fortune,
adding that he expected to surrender tomorrow from the barracks he was
using as a refuge, surrounded by French forces sent to oust him.
He said he had handed over President Said Muhamed Djohar unharmed to
the French Embassy after 600 French troops landed before dawn on the
former French colony north-west of Madagascar.
''We're caught in a trap, we have to accept the consequences,'' Denard
told French television. ''I think that tomorrow we'll have the
conclusion.''
Ruling out a last-ditch fight, he said: ''There have been talks, there
haven't been negotiations. The strike force France has mobilised didn't
allow us to make any resistance.''
Correcting an earlier Defence Ministry announcement that Denard had
already surrendered, French General Raymond Germanos said: ''We are
waiting for him to take his decision and we hope that will be done
quickly.
''Denard has indeed handed over President Djohar, who is right now in
the French Embassy.''
Germanos, an adviser to Defence Minister Charles Millon, has said that
Denard would be taken to France.
Denard, sounding depressed despite flashes of defiance, said he
expected to be tried in France. Asked how he saw his future, Denard said
in a radio interview: ''You know, I'm 66 years old. My future's behind
me.''
Germanos said Comoran Prime Minister Caabi Elyachroutu had granted a
request for amnesty for the Comoran rebels who fought alongside Denard
and his 33-man mercenary force on the islands. Comoran officers in the
coup had accused Djohar of tolerating widespread corruption.
About 800 Comoran rebels, some of them in tears, laid their weapons on
the ground in surrender at the Kandani barracks where Denard had been
holding Djohar, French television said.
Germanos said four or five Comorans were killed after about 600 French
troops landed before dawn in a lightning military action.
The French forces suffered no casualties. Apart from the dead, about
10 people were injured, including two French journalists who were
slightly hurt.
It was the second time France has acted to oust the mercenary, who
served as the Comoro islands' uncrowned king for 12 years until he fled
to South Africa in 1989 after a bloodless French intervention.
Denard defended his action by saying that he had a ''debt of honour''
to soldiers he had trained and who were then locked up in ''vile cells''
by the current government.
''They spent two years in jails, one can't accept that, I promised to
return,'' he said.
Without even waiting for his capture, the French Foreign Ministry
announced that Elyachroutu had formed a new national unity government.
He had called for the French military intervention from refuge in the
French Embassy.
The Defence Ministry said some 600 French troops had gone ashore
before dawn. Another 300 to 400 French soldiers were supporting the
intervention on navy boats offshore or at French bases in Djibouti or on
nearby Mayotte and Reunion islands.
Operation Azalee (Operation Azalea) was the latest in more than a
dozen French military interventions in Africa in the past three decades.
Paris said it was entitled to step in with military assistance in the
case of ''external aggression'' under the terms of a Franco-Comoran
accord signed three years after the archipelago's independence from
France in 1975.--Reuter.

A GROUP of teenagers from across Scotland are to make a unique series
of programmes for Scottish Television aimed at their own age group.
Yesterday, the 12 ''video journalists'' described their first three
weeks gathering ideas and researching a series of six programmes to be
screened in January.
Members of the group, who are all looking for work, will have the
opportunity to appear in front of the camera as well as film and edit
the programmes.
Scottish Television's Bob Tomlinson, the programme's producer, said
the project was a unique television experiment which had given a group
of young people an enviable glimpse into the world of the small screen.
Denying it was youth television on the cheap, he said it was an
attempt to resurrect the apprenticeship system and revealed that the
station had made a substantial contribution to the community
organisations with which the teenagers were involved.
He said the programme, entitled VJ's, would tackle a range of subjects
relevant to teenagers, including drugs, sex, fashion, and music, adding
that he had been very impressed by the refreshing approach taken by the
group.

<TEXT>
A PLATER at a rig construction yard has won his job back and #26,572
compensation for lost earnings after an industrial tribunal ruled that
he was unfairly dismissed.
Mr George Brown, of Turnberry Drive, Kirkcaldy, whose action was a
test case against Trafalgar House Offshore Fabricators Ltd, will be
reinstated to the yard in Methil, Fife, next month. He will have to
return an unspecified redundancy payment.
The tribunal in Dundee concluded that Mr Brown's selection for
redundancy in May last year breached agreed procedure at the yard.
It added that there was no individual consultation or discussion about
redeployment which might have prevented his redundancy.
There was a history of animosity at the yard between platers and pipe
fitters. The platers felt that over the years the pipe fitters had
encroached on work they felt was their exclusive province.
The company's practice was to cease using all temporary and
sub-contract workers before any compulsory redundancies, which would be
selected on a last in first out basis.
But on the day 30 platers were made redundant, two pipe fitters
appeared at a job who ''hadn't a clue'' and had never done that type of
work before. Other workers spoke of the difficulties caused as a result
of pipe fitters doing the jobs normally done by platers.
In addition, the yard had to contract out work to another fabrication
yard in the North of England which could have been carried out by the
platers made redundant.
Foreman pipe fitter Robert Kerr said relationships had improved
between the pipe fitters and the platers since the redundancies and they
were now working together with no problems.

RAILTRACK Scotland said yesterday it had nothing to fear from a Health
and Safety study of the Forth Bridge.
Concern had been expressed at the length of time taken by the Health
and Safety Executive to publish its report on the bridge's structural
condition.
However, a spokeswoman for Railtrack Scotland said: ''We can assure
the public we are co-operating fully with the Health and Safety
Executive and are confident that we have nothing to fear from the
report.''
The Labour MP for Cunninghame South, Mr Brian Donohoe, the only
Scottish member of the Commons Transport Select Committee, urged the HSE
to ''get a move on'' with its assessment.
Mr Donohoe called for speedy action after hearing from Railways
Minister John Watt that the HSE hoped to publish its findings at the end
of the year, nine months after it was asked by the Department of
Transport to investigate.
Mr Watt also stated the recent withdrawal of one of the bridge's
painting contractors, McGills, had made no difference to the maintenance
of the structure.
Mr Donohoe has tabled an Early Day Motion calling for the restoration
of a continuous painting programme.
A spokesman for the HSE said the report was under way but there was no
date yet for publication.

DISAPPOINTED customers have ranked the Bank of Scotland one of the
worst in the country for mistakes, according to a survey by the
Consumers' Association.
A quarter of the bank's customers questioned had experienced a problem
with standing orders or direct debits in the last year, says Which?
magazine.
The Clydesdale Bank also fared poorly in the poll of more than 3000
members. In the overall customer satisfaction stakes it was ranked near
the bottom by customers questioned, although the level of mistakes, a
separate category, was not particularly bad.
The only gold star for performance among the Scottish high street
banks went to the Royal Bank of Scotland which, along with the Alliance
and Leicester and First Direct has, says Which?, the most satisfied
customers.
In response to the survey, both the Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale
said the results contradicted their own findings and they questioned the
size of the sample taken.
Mr Gavin Masterton, the Bank of Scotland's general manager and deputy
treasurer, said a recent independent survey of bank customers had
revealed 96% were satisfied with the service.
''Naturally, I was very disappointed with the results of the Which?
survey, which suggests that some of our customers are not altogether
happy with us, although the sample was substantially smaller than that
carried out for us,'' he said.
''I was surprised that the results seemed to contradict the findings
of independent research but we acknowledge that the only acceptable
level of customer satisfaction has to be 100% and we still have some way
to go.''
The Clydesdale Bank also said the results conflicted with their own
surveys. A spokesman said: ''We are not denigrating the Which? report
but it was based on a sample of 3000 people of which only around 100
were our customers. Our own findings show 2% were not particularly happy
with the service and that is something we are working on.''
Mr Frank Kirwan, retail banking director of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, said his bank's good performance was a result of substantial
investment in staff and service provision.
''I am delighted that once again we are the only high street bank to
be rated in the top category for service quality,'' he added.
Overall, however, banks are making fewer mistakes -- but a quarter of
customers still find errors in their current account, says Which?
The report says the level of mistakes remains ''unacceptably high''.
One in eight had problems with a direct debit or standing order last
year, one in nine were charged incorrectly, and two in three who had
complained were unhappy about the way they had been treated.
Barclays and NatWest were bottom of the table for customer
satisfaction. Midland had improved significantly since last year but,
like Lloyds, was still only average. Alliance &amp; Leicester, First Direct,
and the Royal Bank of Scotland fared best in the survey, says Which?
Which? said customers should take a tougher line when banks slipped up
and demand compensation. ''The current level of bank bungling is still
unacceptable. Too many mistakes slip through the net,'' said the
magazine's money editor, Mr Graeme Jacobs.
''Year after year, we find that the big banks' customers are less
satisfied than those who have accounts with the smaller banks.''
The British Bankers' Association welcomed the confirmation that
complaints were falling but said independent surveys had found a higher
level of customer satisfaction than Which? reported.

FALDO was never off the greens in a bid to reduce his handicap by 20.
But it was Faldo the golden retriever not the golfer and it was pounds
not strokes which the overweight guide dog had to shed.
Ten-year-old Faldo, who liked nothing better than a tasty can of dog
meat, was put on a diet of raw cabbage.
His owner, Ms Jenny Hodgson, of Geanies Street, Tain, Easter Ross,
said: ''Surprisingly, he did not turn up his nose at them. In fact, he
loved them. We mixed in a tiny spot of dog food with the cabbages but he
would eat them on their own.
''Faldo weighed 100lbs when he should really have been 80lbs. The only
place we could find to weigh him to chart his progress was on the coal
scales at the local trading standards office. The staff there thought it
was a real hoot when we phoned up to ask to weigh him.''
Ms Hodgson, who is partially blind, and her daughter, Georgina,
decided to make the dog's diet a sponsored slim and raised #556 for the
Guide Dogs for the Blind and the local Blythswood charity.
Faldo is due for retirement next year, but Ms Hodgson, her daughter,
and her 80-year-old mother will keep him as a family pet.
Meanwhile, a pub manager was reunited with his pet spaniel yesterday
after three Court of Appeal judges decided in Edinburgh on Tuesday to
free the five-year-old dog which had been sentenced to be destroyed last
January at Dumfries Sheriff Court for attacking a policeman in Gretna.
Mr Ron Brown and his wife, Ann, relief managers at the Crown Inn,
Carlisle, could not leave the pub immediately to collect their pet.
Yesterday, Mr Brown travelled 33 miles to Cairnsmore Kennels in Dumfries
where Kauma had been kept for nine months by order of the court.
The couple's appeal hearing was twice postponed but they kept up their
fight and were bolstered by huge public support, including a
4000-signature petition.
The appeal has cost the taxpayer an estimated #52,000 including court
costs and boarding fees. ''I think that is disgusting,'' said Mr Brown.
''The case should never have gone as far as it did. There was no
evidence the policeman had been injured, although it was claimed Kauma
had snapped at his hand and upper thigh.''
The incident happened in June last year when police called during the
night at the Gretna pub where the Browns were working. Mrs Brown, who
answered the door, was charged with having two dogs which were
dangerously out of control and was fined #100. She claimed the dogs were
simply protecting her.

A SCOTTISH fishing skipper who rescued five men drifting in a storm
said yesterday he was ''embarrassed'' to accept an award for his
bravery.
Mr Peter Smith, 45, captain of the Ambassador, went to the aid of
another fishing boat, Heather Bloom, when he sighted flares in a severe
gale 100 miles west of Shetland last December.
He battled through appalling conditions to lift four crewmen from one
liferaft and then ''in a display of outstanding seamanship'' manoeuvred
his ship in 40ft seas alongside another raft to take off a fifth
survivor.
Mr Smith, of Buckie, was one of nine to receive bravery awards from
the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society in London.
Before accepting the Lady Swaythling Trophy, he confided: ''I am
embarrassed because I feel I have reward enough in helping these
people.''
Mr Smith shared the award with 50-year-old Lerwick lifeboat coxswain,
Mr Hewitt Clark. He was commended for ''exemplary skill, judgment,
courage, and leadership'' when a Russian factory ship, Pionersk, struck
rocks off Shetland last October.
Mr Clark steered the lifeboat between the stricken vessel and the
shore in surging seas to rescue 67 crewmen. He said the award ''is for
all my crew''.
During the same incident, four coastguard helicopter crew, based at
Sumburgh, airlifted the Pionersk's remaining 89 crewmen to safety. All
received the Edward and Maisie Lewis award.
BP tanker captain Paul Anderson, 42, from Bude, Cornwall, and chief
officer Mike Johnston, 35, from Worthing, were both honoured with the
society's Emile Robin Award for their part in the rescue of nine crew
from a sinking ship off Greece last November.
Meanwhile, three men received bravery awards in Aberdeen for pulling a
man from his blazing car.
Mr Frank Fricker, 47, who now lives in Norway; Mr Peter Gordon, 28, of
Inchmarlo Road, Banchory; and Mr Raymond Brown, 28, of Springfield Road,
Aberdeen, saved Mr Ian Rosbrook, 19, after his car left the
Aberdeen-Westhill road, hit a tree, somersaulted, landed back on the
carriageway, and burst into flames.

Sarajevo
NATO warplanes attacked Bosnian Serb missile sites today, a move
condemned by a Bosnian Serb leader as ''a definite step back in the
peace process''.
Diplomatic sources said Nato blasted two missile batteries in
north-west Bosnia and one near Sarajevo after they targeted patrolling
Alliance jets with radar.
Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the Bosnian Serbs, said the attack
''simply does not make sense and is not going to help the peace
process''.
However international negotiators saw improved peace prospects after
hearing a ''serious ceasefire proposal'' from the Bosnian Government.
The air raids were the first against the Serbs since the last month,
when they removed most of their heavy guns from around Sarajevo after a
two-week Nato bombardment.
Since then, negotiators led by UN envoy Richard Holbrooke have pressed
both sides to continue the process by agreeing a ceasefire. Holbrooke
refused to disclose the terms of the new Bosnian offer, but said he
would discuss it immediately in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and hoped to return with a reply tomorrow.
The US-led diplomacy, battling for an end to the 3[1/2]-year war, was
boosted yesterday by progress on a dispute over a Serb-held region of
Croatia.
However renewed Muslim-Serb artillery battles south of Sarajevo
yesterday, a Serb counter-offensive in north-west Bosnia, and a car bomb
attack on Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov left no doubt that bringing
off a Balkan peace will be a tall order.
Macedonia named an acting president after Gligorov was badly injured
yesterday's attempt to kill him. Speaker Stojan Andov took over the
presidency of the former Yugoslav republic as Gligorov had surgery for
severe head and eye injuries.--Reuter.

TONY BLAIR has declared that the Tories are already in Opposition,
carping on the sidelines. Yesterday his would-be Ministers were busy
preparing for government on their Brighton conference platform.
They will do many things in education, health, and transport. However,
rhere was a growing sense that there was an important piece of the ''New
Britain'' puzzle missing.
It is not just Mr Blair's reluctance to abolish the grant maintained
system for schools, although the old Right in the shape of their former
deputy leader Roy Hattersley had sarcastic things to say about that.
It was not just that the National Health Service needs saving again,
although there were those who wondered precisely how this is to be done
and at what cost.
And when the Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher declared that
Labour will end out-of-town supermarket developments because they
generate traffic, convenience shoppers were given a judder.
At the heart of the Labour quandary -- largely unstated publicly at
the conference -- is what the public/private sector mix is to be in Mr
Blair's new economic paradise. There is clearly much work yet to do on
this before Mr Blair approaches an election manifesto.
He told BBC radio yesterday: ''You have the Labour Party standing up
and making policy announcements, saying how the direction of the country
could be different. And you have the Conservatives sitting there
cavilling and responding as if they were sitting on the Opposition side
of the House of Commons. They are now the Opposition.''
But there are plenty of people in Brighton who wonder if Mr Blair is
quite there yet.
The old spin doctor Mr Peter Mandelson yesterday anticipated the Tory
cavilling to come when they gather in Blackpool next week. He told a
Young Fabian fringe meeting on the theme ''What Next for New Labour?''
that Mr Blair has set out the vision for New Britain but a lot more
policy work has to be done. And, marking the Tories' card, he itemised
the welfare state and the railways as key areas where funding and
organisation must be provided.
''We have rightly said that a modern welfare system must be created
that effectively tackles poverty and want, that is affordable and
reduces welfare dependency.
''New Labour needs to set out how public and private provision will be
combined to create a modern welfare system that is fair for all and
universal in its reach.''
He continued: ''We will have work to do on the future of the railways
if privatisation takes place.'' The grandson of Herbert Morrison,
stalwart of the Attlee Government, added: ''Nobody believes that simply
restoring them to their former Morrisonian glory would be an option and
so we will have to explore a new, modern, form of public ownership and
control, in partnership with the private finance that John Prescott has
long advocated.''
So far from Mr Blair or any of his putative Cabinet we have not
received answers to this key Mandelson poser. Yesterday the Blair agenda
cantered through the votes on education, health and transport.
Anybody, like Mr Hattersley, who raised the hackles was quick to fall
back on the loyalty line. He and Mr David Blunkett, who would be
Education Secretary in a Blair Government, had a set to in the
conference hall -- but by nightfall they had kissed and made up. Blair
''families'' never go to bed with a row unresolved.

A SURVEY by a leading conservation body, on the performance of 13
European countries in forest protection and management, has ranked the
UK eighth and given it an overall assessment of ''poor''.
The report, published today by the World Wide Fund for Nature, finds
that of the 13 countries surveyed, not one is effectively protecting
even 10% of its original forests.
Mr Martin Mathers, forests policy officer for WWF UK, said: ''The UK
Government has failed to put in place an adequate system of protected
areas, making our surviving natural forest particularly vulnerable to
casual felling and overgrazing.''
However, he added: ''In spite of what appears to be a low result, many
will be surprised that the UK has scored so well. Only five years ago,
our forest policy was little short of ecological vandalism.
''The Forestry Commission has made vast strides forward in that time.
If only those in Government had done as well, we could have seen the UK
close to the top of the European league table.''
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Office said the protection of existing
ancient forests was something in which the Government took a deep
interest.
She pointed to the system of designating Sites of Special Scientific
Interest and added that the Government implemented a number of European
directives which gave protection to important sites.
She added that, earlier this week, the Millennium Commission had
awarded #5.75m to regenerating native forests in Scotland.
A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said he would be interested to
see how WWF had put its figures together.

<HEADLINE>Boot camps not the real answer to crime, says expert</HEADLINE>

AMERICA'S boot camps, while saving vast sums because prisoners spend
less time behind bars, are inneffective at preventing reoffending,
Scottish prison governors were told yesterday.
They were also told that the Scottish Prison Service might be able to
tender for the running of the country's first privatised prison. Plans
for it are expected at the end of the year.
The disclosures came at the annual prison management conference in
Peebles.
Senior prison service researcher Ed Wozniak said the American
experience effectively destroyed the notion that the brutal regimes much
loved by the Home Secretary have an effect on crime.
Mr Wozniak said that six weeks in camps across America and Canada had
shown that the term boot camp was a misnomer, since the regimes he had
studied had ranged from the brutal to the benign, some regimes involving
hours of purposeful activity.
In New York, the boot camp capital, prisoners with a two or three-year
sentence signed up for six months in boot camp plus six months community
supervision, saving on average 330 days behind bars.
This brought an average saving of #1.35m for every 100 prisoners
diverted to boot camp and this, Mr Wozniak, was what the public really
appreciated.
''While there is some brutality in some of the regimes in the deep
south, the public here would be surprised at the level of meaningful
work which boot camps involve in terms of education and substance abuse
programmes, for example.
''They are radically different from the detention centre short, sharp
shock which we had here. I think some people here would benefit but
others would not, although what I witnessed would fit in with the
current SPS opportunity and responsibility agenda,'' Mr Wozniak said.
He added, however: ''A major study of boot camps by the National
Instution of Justice concluded there was no empirical evidence that they
reduced recidivism. When you talk to prisoners they talk positively in
terms of increased self esteem. They are physically fitter and mentally
more agile. There are benefits but reoffending is not one.''
The possibility of tendering for the proposed private prison would be
a radical departure from the Government's private prisons initiative
which has turned the running of some jails in England over to private
security companies. Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth had hinted to the
prison service and union that this could be possible.
The move was confirmed yesterday by Mr Edward Frizzell, the chief
executive of the Scottish Prison Service, who said that, while he did
not wish to over-emphasise the possibilities of success, it was
something the service could look at.
The general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association, Mr Derek
Turner, said yesterday: ''We were surprised and pleased at the Secretary
of State's attitude. Prior to our meeting with him, we never had any
impression we would have such an opportunity.
''It came out of the blue. The question was asked and he said he did
not rule out the opportunity. We are aware there are many legal
difficulties but where there is a will there is a way. With our unique
knowledge of the people and the culture we would be in a strong
position.''
Earlier, Mr Frizzell told the prison governors that secure custody
alone was no longer enough, although it always had to be their top
priority. The service had to ask itself how it could build on best
practice to have an impact on the level of crime and reoffending.
He added that, for the first time in a decade, there had been no
incidents of rioting or hostage taking in Scotish jails, but the major
black spot on last year's performance had been the alarming rise in the
number of suicides.

FAX wars broke out at the Labour Party conference in Brighton last
night as potentially embarrassing pieces of paper were banded about,
writes Robbie Dinwoodie.
Labour themselves stood accused of putting undue pressure on the BBC
by sending a fax urging them to put Tony Blair's leadership speech above
the O J Simpson verdict on their main evening news schedule.
Scottish Conservatives, meanwhile, stood accused of conducting party
propaganda at the taxpayers' expense, as a letter from Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth to Mr Blair, accusing him of stealing Tory
education policies was seen to emanate from the Scottish Office rather
than from Tory Central Office in Leith.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson pointed out that there was
a convention that any activities that were party political had to come
from party offices and not from Government departments.
''It was pretty unconvincing propaganda anyway,'' he said, ''but is
the taxpayer going to reimbursed for these faxes coming out of St
Andrew's House? The Tory party have a huge overdraft but I don't see why
the taxpayer should be asked to subsidise their propaganda.''
Senior Conservative sources were scornful of the accusation last night
saying that Mr Robertson was being ''ridiculously petty'' and suggesting
that his outburst was a clear attempt to draw attention away from the
serious split which had emerged in the Scottish Constitutional
Convention. ''Perhaps Mr Robertson would like to give a breakdown of the
cost of sending two sheets of paper by fax,'' he said.
The row involving Labour spin-doctors may last longer. Mr Blair's
press secretary, Alastair Campbell, confirmed that he had faxed
broadcasters suggesting that Mr Blair's speech should take prominance
over the O J Simpson trial.
The fax stated: ''Whilst, of course, news judgments must be made in
the light of other stories on any particular day, and whilst I fully
understand there is much interest in the verdict, I would implore you
not to lose sight both of the news value and of the importance to the
country of Mr Blair's speech.''
Mr Campbell said yesterday that the language used in his message was
''clearly not intimidatory'' and he saw no problem with the
communication. However, a further irony was that while the ITN's
flagship News at Ten programme led with the Simpson verdict and did very
well in the ratings, it was understood that the BBC Nine O'clock News
suffered by putting Mr Blair's speech first.

A WOMAN who stabbed her upstairs neighbour after a row about loud
music was insane at the time, a jury has decided.
Victoria Whyte's rare defence of insanity was accepted by the jury at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court, which decided that she did attack Mr Norman
Pearson in the Granton Medway, Edinburgh, on September 17 last year, but
acquitted her.
Sheriff Andrew Bell sent Whyte, 31, to the State Mental Hospital at
Carstairs. The sheriff turned down a plea from her solicitor, Mr Martin
Collins, to send her back to the Queen Margaret Hospital, Dunfermline,
where she was treated after the incident.
Whyte, from Stockport, a single mother with a three-year-old daughter,
told the jury that she stabbed Mr Pearson in the backside but added: ''I
was so detached. It was as if it wasn't real.''
She said that, when she was being interviewed by police, she thought
she was in the police station in the TV series, The Bill.
Psychiatrist Alan Beveridge told the court that Whyte had suffered
''an acute psychotic episode''. He said staff at the Dunfermline
hospital were convinced her mental illness was genuine.
Mr Pearson, 33, a ventilation engineer, told the trial that he went
down to Whyte's flat to apologise after she sent a friend up to complain
about his loud music. He described how Whyte went for him on the common
stairs and stabbed him twice.

WOULD-BE investors in a privatised rail system were warned yesterday
that a Labour government could not guarantee subsidy levels, might
consider altering rail franchise terms and would stop cuts in services.
This strong declaration by Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher
followed Labour leader Tony Blair's commitment the previous day to
return the entire rail industry to public ownership and accountability.
During the transport debate, Mr Meacher also warned train franchise
holders that their revenue faced being squeezed by the cap on fares and
by Railtrack's ever-rising track access charges.
''If you still want to buy a pig in a poke in all those circumstances,
that's up to you, but don't come crying to me when it all ends in
tears.''
This concerted bid to scare off investors was well received by
delegates and Mr Keith Bill, national secretary of the all-party Save
Our Railways campaign, who said that Mr Meacher's statement on top of Mr
Blair's commitment finally could kill off the Government's privatisation
programme .
Anyone contemplating investing in Railtrack would face two threats --
that a Labour government would reduce subsidies to curb profits pending
moves to restore the industry to public ownership.
Potential investors should ask themselves whether it was worth going
after limited profits for just a year or two, he added.
Much of the passion had been taken out of the transport debate by Mr
Blair's commitment to renationalisation which was warmly welcomed by
rail union leaders who earlier in the week had felt they might have a
battle on their hands to get such support.
Promising a ''rail renaissance'', Mr Meacher claimed there was scope
for cuts in fares which would be more than offset by an increase in
people travelling off-peak on the trains.
He said Labour would fund a better integrated public transport network
by shifting the transport budget away from motorway building.
Changes would include a high-speed rail link not just from the Channel
to London but to Scotland and the North of England, with connections to
the east, west and Wales.
''Of course we will still build roads where appropriate ... but this
will be balanced by much stronger emphasis on greatly improved and
extended public transport.''
Union leaders spoke out at the conference against the rail sell-off.
Transport and General Workers Union general secretary Bill Morris said
privatisation ''will not go full-steam ahead when Labour comes to power:
it will be stopped and stopped immediately and returned to the public
sector. That's where it belongs''.
Calling for a comprehensive transport policy covering all modes of
travel, Mr Morris urged: ''We must adopt a transport system that is
carefully planned, tightly regulated, properly integrated, with a proper
balance between road and rail.
Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of train drivers union Aslef, branded
as ''lies'' the Government's pledges to improve rail safety following
fatal accidents.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union,
said: ''This barmy Government have thrown away 150 years of railway
operating experience and decided to fragment the railways into 94
pieces.''
He claimed this was undermining safety, while privatisation would mean
fewer services.
Highlands delegate Jackie Mitchell told the conference that he was
probably the person who had travelled farthest to get to Brighton and he
was proud to say he had made the journey by rail. He said that with a
vast area and sparse population the Highlands economy depended on
efficient and effective communications and transport links.
The break-up and privatisation of the railway system would be a
disaster in an area where it could never be treated as a profit-making
business.
The attempt to destroy the Fort William sleeper service had been
defeated by a tremendous campaign with Labour at the forefront but that
was only part of a greater battle to preserve a rail system service the
people of all parts of the UK within an integrated transport system --
''A rail system designed to serve the people, not line the pockets of
fat cats.''

THE fault-lines between New Labour and Old opened up yesterday over
education policy, with former deputy leader Roy Hattersley cast in the
once unlikely role as champion of the left.
He castigated Labour's new policy for not bringing opted out
grant-maintained schools fully back into the fold of the state sector,
and accused the party's leadership of failing to defend the ideal of
comprehensive education.
A substantial minority of delegates agreed with Mr Hattersley and gave
him an ovation. However, there soon followed a withering put-down from
Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett, who turned to him during a
highly-charged exchange during which he was heckled by Mr Hattersley and
his supporters and said: ''If I am angry, it is because those who did
not come up with solutions when in office should not criticise those who
have done so now.''
Mr Hattersley's intervention was dramatic. He said the new policy
document should have promised a unified system of comprehensive
education and should have ended grant-maintained status completely.
Instead, he said, it offered grant-maintained schools the chance to be
different, ''the chance to pose as superior''.
The Government was finding it difficult to bribe or bully schools into
opting out and he said of this system: ''Why we should prop it up seems
beyond comprehension.''
He appealed to delegates: ''For God's sake let's stop apologising
about comprehensive schools. Let us not take on the Tories on their own
ground.''
However Mr Blunkett took on Mr Hattersley head on. At first he joked:
''Roy, when socialists fall out the Tories benefit. When Sheffield
Wednesday supporters fall out the gods weep. Remember, the team that
kicks into its own goal always loses the match.''
Having made a light point he then launched his heavy criticism of Mr
Hattersley for failing to solve these problems when he was deputy leader
and the conference warmed to him. ''Watch my lips,'' he said. ''With
Labour there will be no selection by examination or interview. Labour
will make every school a good school.''
Mr Hattersley said afterwards that his intervention had been
calculated to win three points and he felt he had achieved
two-and-a-half of them. He was pleased at the unequivocal rejection of
selection on either academic or social grounds and he welcome the pledge
that schools would be funded in accordance with their special needs.
He also welcomed the commitment to extending the comprehensive system
and said that although this fell short of a pledge to scrap
grant-maintained and opted out status it virtually amounted to the same
thing.
The debate featured an impressive contribution on behalf of New Labour
from the youngest member of the National Executive -- 22-year-old
Catherine Taylor from Wishaw, who is now studying geography and
international relations at St Andrews University.
Moving the leadership's proposals contained in a new policy document,
Diversity and Excellence, she said: ''As the only NEC member to have
gone through the whole educational experience under a Conservative
Government it is an issue close to my heart.
Ms Taylor said the Government did not care about over-crowded
classrooms, teachers lacking resources, parents' concerns about class
sizes, women who could not return to work because of the lack of
adequate nursery education provision, or pupils who simply could not
afford to go on to higher education.
She had gone to primary and secondary school in Wishaw, where in spite
of underfunding, and lack of resources good teachers had given her a
sense of identity, pride in the community, and the qualifications to go
to university.
The Tories were now reversing all this, dividing access to higher
education between those who can afford it and those who can't, putting
money before merit.
Anger bubbled under the surface of the debate as speaker after speaker
spoke in favour of the leadership's position, frustrating those who
wanted to argue for a traditional left wing position demanding that
comprehensive education be re-imposed on all opted out schools. Then the
critics got their chance.
Coventry delegate Maggie Rosher made the direct reference that had
been unspoken so far this week. She turned to Labour leader Tony Blair
and to Harriet Harman, who have both sent children to opted-out schools,
and said: ''Have they any idea of the great sense of betrayal people
like me who spent more than 40 years in the teaching profession and even
longer in the Labour Party at them preferring grant-maintained schools
for their children? Every child should have the same chance.''

CALLS for tax cuts look set to dominate next week's Tory Party
conference as the party tries to meet the General Election challenge
posed by Tony Blair.
Conservatives are aware that they must be seen as the party of
government, capable of handling the economy, and that finding room for
tax cuts may be their strongest card.
Tory chairman Brian Mawhinney yesterday acknowledged strong grassroots
pressure to cut taxes by sharply pruning government spending. His
comments, in the run-up to the party conference, came after Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke warned nobody should assume ''that tax cuts are safely in
the bag.''
In a recent interview with The Herald, Mr Clarke said that he wanted
to reduce the overall burden of taxation, and get the balance right
between direct and indirect taxation. However, he pointed out, there
were limits to tax cuts.
Mr Clarke has said that he already has reduced spending plans by about
#45 billion in the past two Budgets, and finding more cuts would be
difficult, but company directors have warned the Government would be in
political danger if it failed to announce tax cuts in next month's
Budget.
A barrage of motions has been submitted to next week's conference from
the Tory rank-and-file demanding tax reductions, with 62 motions
submitted by local party associations critical of the Government's tax
policy.
Dr Mawhinney said the Blackpool conference debates would show which
policies party members wanted the Government to pursue.
He said: ''Indications are that they will include strong backing for
continuing tough policies against crime, our anti-inflation stand, a
desire to cut taxes by controlling public expenditure, targeting social
security spending on genuine need, and a reaffirmation of the Prime
Minister's call for a Europe of nation states.''
He also claimed, in an article in the parliamentary House Magazine,
that internal Labour splits and rows had reinforced the message that
Labour was not fit for government.
''All the presentational packaging cannot hide the reality of Labour
and its policies.''
Next week will be the first time the Prime Minister has faced
activists at a major Tory conference since he successfully fought off a
leadership challenge from John Redwood.
Dr Mawhinney said that behind a revival in Tory fortunes, and the
pressure of Labour, lay a single factor: John Major's decision to force
a leadership contest. ''His winning of it so convincingly has marked the
turning point in this Parliament.''
Meanwhile, Mr Redwood yesterday accused the Labour leader of stealing
his ideas and called him the ''thieving magpie of British politics''.
In a back-handed endorsement of Mr Blair's conference speech on
Tuesday, the defeated Tory leadership candidate accused him of poaching
his scheme for a national information superhighway and a cut in VAT on
fuel.
Mr Redwood was launching a new book outlining his own plan for the
Tories to win the next election. He made clear that victory for the
Tories was by no means a certainty, saying he could not predict the
outcome.

HOLLYWOOD stars may descend on the capital of the Highlands for the
next film premiere to be held in Scotland.
Inverness is being mooted as a suitable location for the first British
screening of the #6.5m film Loch Ness, starring Cheers star Ted Danson
and Joely Richardson of Lady Chatterley fame.
Highland Regional Council want the premiere staged at Eden Court
Theatre and publicity people for the new film say ''there is no reason
why it could not take place in the Highland capital''.
It would be a noteable coup for the area after the successes of the
premieres of Rob Roy and Braveheart in Edinburgh and Stirling.
Mr Duncan MacPherson, the council's convener, said: ''It would just be
another premiere in London but up here it would be a major event. We
could guarantee big, enthusiastic crowds and the best hospitality in the
world. Eden Court is easily capable of handling this type of occasion.''
Working Title, the London-based production company responsible for the
hit movie Four Weddings and a Funeral, is putting the finishing touches
to Loch Ness.
It was expected to be put on general release by the end of this year
but is slightly behind schedule and will not be screened now until
January or February 1996.
Mr Lesley Anderson, a spokesman for the company, said: ''We have been
talking quite a lot about where to have the premiere and Inverness is
one of the front runners. However, London is also a possibility.''
Ted Danson plays a disillusioned scientist whose boss sends him to
find the Loch Ness monster as a punishment.
Glasgow girl Kirsty Graham, 9, of Scotstoun, makes her screen debut in
the movie after being picked from more than 1000 seven and
eight-year-olds.

A JUDGE yesterday halted the prosecution of Mr Geoffrey Knights,
friend of EastEnders actress Gillian Taylforth, because of what he
called ''unfair, outrageous, and oppressive'' reporting.
A police investigation into claims of ''improper collusion'' between
journalists and some witnesses in the case was later announced by the
Solicitor General, Sir Derek Spencer.
Judge Roger Sanders told Harrow Crown Court that a ''grave abuse of
process'' by the media had forced him to ''stay'' Mr Knights's
forthcoming trial on wounding and assault charges.
He named eight tabloid national newspapers and several individual
journalists, saying that some writers seemed to have conducted a ''hate
campaign'' against Mr Knights.
He called for the Attorney General to consider contempt of court
proceedings against the editors and the Director of Public Prosecutions
to investigate whether some journalists had made illegal approaches to
prosecution witnesses.
Mr Knights, a 41-year-old consultant, who has had a stormy on-off
relationship with Miss Taylforth and is the father of the couple's
three-year-old daughter, allegedly attacked cab driver Martin Davies.
He was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Mr
Davies, 33, after an incident this year on Easter Sunday, outside the
couple's home in Macaret Close, Whetstone, north London.
He also faced an alternative charge of unlawful wounding. He denied
both counts at an earlier hearing and the trial was due to start on
October 16.
It was understood it was the first time ''adverse publicity'' had been
successfully cited as the sole reason for ordering criminal proceedings
to be ''stayed'' -- a legal term meaning the case will never be heard.
The judge was accepting the argument of Mr Knights's defence counsel,
Mr Jerome Lynch, that it would be impossible for his client to have a
fair trial because of publicity which had been ''unlawful, misleading,
and scandalous''.
Mr John Plumstead, prosecuting, had also agreed with the defence view
and had suggested press coverage might also be described as
''malicious''.
The judge said Mr Knights had been arrested after ''a vicious and
sustained attack'' which caused serious injuries to Mr Davies, who was
called to the couple's home when Ms Taylforth was planning to leave Mr
Knight.
Ms Taylforth was well known to millions of TV viewers and, to tabloid
editors' ''obvious relish'', it turned out that her lover had ''a bad
criminal record''.
After the attack had been reported, the Daily Mirror and Today carried
Mr Davies's alleged accounts of what had happened.
The judge referred to coverage in six other papers: the Daily Mail --
with articles by Lynda Lee-Potter -- the Sun, Daily Star, The People,
Sunday Mirror -- with an article by Terry O'Hanlon -- and the Daily
Express -- with an article by Peter Batt.
The publicity meant jurors were bound to have read about the case and
the credibility of witnesses had been ''put in issue'', denying the
defendant a fair trial, he said.
Sir Derek Spencer said on BBC Radio 4 that if there was a ''reasonable
prospect'' of showing any publication had carried a ''substantial risk
of serious prejudice to the trial'', the matter would be referred to the
Divisional Court.
A Mirror Group spokesman denied that any of its titles -- the Daily
and Sunday Mirror, and The People -- had published stories with a
substantial risk of serious prejudice to the Knights case.
Mr Paul Dacre, editor of the Daily Mail, said the paper took the
Contempt of Court Act very seriously and would be ''defending our
position vigorously''.
The Sun, Today, Daily Express, and Daily Star said they were making no
comment on the case.

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH university yesterday clinched a deal worth nearly #650,000
with a leading US biochemicals company to market its research proteins
around the world.
Dundee University's department of biochemistry is to receive the money
over the next 10 years in a deal with New York-based Upstate
Biotechnology Incorporated.
The US company will sell the proteins, which can be used to test
drugs, to research scientists worldwide.
Demand for the newly-developed proteins is expected to come from
scientists working in the fields of cancer, arthritis and diabetes.
Professor Philip Cohen of the university's Department of Biochemistry
said: ''The company first approched us two years ago to market two
proteins that we had just developed.
''Since then, things have grown and this deal means they will be
marketing around 40 of our protein's to other researchers.''
The department is renowned for its work in isolating and purifying
research proteins and enzymes.
Professor Cohen added: ''A lot of other biochemical labs decided to
concentrate on genetics and DNA. But we continued to work on proteins.
''Now we lead the way in proteins and other labs will buy our proteins
for their own research.''
Upstate's marketing manager Ray McKinney yesterday said that he
expected the proteins to generate an income far in excess of the money
guaranteed to the university.
He said: ''The University of Dundee is at the cutting edge of research
into proteins.
''There is a gap in the market for these products, and we expect other
scientists to benefit from having access to them.
''I expect these products to generate three or four times the income
guaranteed to the University of Dundee.''

PLANTING ''vicious'' bushes around your garden could deter
housebreakers, a police chief claimed yesterday.
Assistant Chief Constable Crispian Strachan of Strathclyde Police said
that cunningly placed 2ft berberis plants could be a thorn in the side
of thieves.
''Some berberis plants have spines which are two inches long,'' he
said. ''They are vicious, real man-eaters.
''Plants like that are difficult for people to push through. Any
burglar trying would, I think, end up rather sore in more ways than one!
''This idea has been around for thousands of years. The Romans used
spikey bushes along their earthen walls.''
Mr Strachan also suggested that prickly shrub roses might do the
trick, saying: ''I have a trellis at home and I would defy anyone to get
over it.''
Indeed, any spiny plant which did not grow above 2ft might be the
answer, he said. Any higher and it might just provide a hiding place for
lurking criminals.
People interested in trying this new ''security system'' will be able
to discuss maintenance and model types with Beechgrove Garden expert
Walter Gilmour later this month.
Mr Gilmour will be on the police crime prevention stand at the Modern
Homes Exhibition in the SECC, Glasgow, from October 16 to 22.
Mr Gilmour has suggested a few plant varieties that would ''take the
breeks'' off would-be burglars.
Some roses, he said, would really stop them in their tracks. ''The
rosa moyessii is very attractive and they have a thorn on them that is
slightly curved.
''Pillar roses can be grown against gutter pipes, which would
otherwise make a climbing frame for people wanting to get to a house's
windows or roof.
''And there is now an ornamental bramble bush which has milky white
stems. Their thorns are very barbarous.''

A FIRST World War hand grenade caused a major alert in Lower Largo
yesterday.
Police and Army explosives experts were called in and houses in the
Fife village were evacuated.
Mr Andrew Gillett, 36, of Durham Gardens, Lower Largo, found the
grenade while walking in Broxburn several weeks ago and took it home as
a memento. He left it on his window sill and called police after it was
found to be ''sweating''.
About two dozen houses were evacuated as the grenade was taken to a
nearby beach and detonated in a controlled explosion.
Inspector Brian Winton, of Fife Police said: ''We would appeal to
people's better judgment. If such finds are made, they should clearly
mark the spot -- not move the device -- and notify the police without
delay.''

AN Ayrshire bowling club is locked in a legal dispute over the
expulsion of a woman member for being improperly dressed at the club
dance.
Kincaidston and Belmont Bowling Club alleges that Mrs Caroline
McLaughlan took off her knickers at the dance then made an issue of her
state of undress with the vice- president and bar staff.
Now, Mrs McLaughlan, 43, of Pine Brae, Ayr, has asked her solicitor to
clear her tarnished reputation and have her reinstated at the club -- so
that she can resign and join another club.
The club also alleges that Mrs McLaughlan was abusive to members on
another occasion and tore a beer mat -- claims which she strongly denies
and says she has witnesses to prove her innocence.
Mrs McLaughlan said: ''I was wearing a quite expensive evening dress
and, yes, I did go to the ladies and take off my elasticated pants and I
did return and put them in my husband's jacket pocket. But that is all.
And surely that is between us.''
Her husband John, a supervisor with the Royal Bank of Scotland and
former club treasurer, declined to comment but is understood to have
written a letter about the behaviour of another member towards his son.
When Mrs McLaughlan was asked by the management committee to give
evidence about these allegations, she was astonished to find that she
was the target of criticism and was being put on a good behaviour bond
for a year.
She added: ''I got a letter from the club saying that I was
reprimanded and that, under some bye-law, they could discipline anyone
they want.''
Mrs McLaughlan said that neither she nor her solicitor, Mrs Maria
Galli, was given an opportunity to present their case to the management
committee.
Mrs Galli has called the ban a breach of the club's constitution and
of natural justice. She said: ''We are suing the club for damages to
compensate for the stress, anxiety, and humiliation Mrs McLaughlan has
suffered.
Mr William Fulton, secretary of the bowling club, said: ''As far as we
are concerned, the matter is in the hands of our solicitor. We are not
prepared to wash our dirty linen in public.''

THE disclosure by a Scottish Office Minister that a new community
hospital at Cumnock would be financed by the private sector provoked an
angry response yesterday.
Local MP George Foulkes said he was astonished by the statement from
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton that the new hospital would come under the
private finance initiative.
The row casts a shadow over the success of the Ayrshire and Arran
Community Health Care NHS Trust in winning the health board contract to
provide a 74-bed hospital for both in-patient and day care for a wide
variety of patients.
Lord James yesterday met senior trust and health board officials in
Ayr and heard details of the #8.6m plan which he said was ''excellent
news for the people of East Ayrshire''.
Lord James said: ''In common with other NHS contracts, the trust will
be seeking private finance for the building of the hospital. It will be
operated by NHS people for NHS patients.''
However, Mr Foulkes said the announcement of private sector
involvement in the contract, worth #8.6m in the construction phase and
#3.4m a year in running costs, flew in the face of promises given by
recently retired Ayrshire and Arran Health Board general manager Mr Jim
Eckford.
He said: ''Jim Eckford stood before a meeting of about 200 people in
Cumnock a few months ago and made it clear that the project would be
funded within the NHS.
''I am astonished and flabbergasted that we learn in a throwaway
remark from Lord James that private finance will be sought for this
project. He has said it will be run within the NHS but we were told that
the entire project would be a public one and I have no doubt that was
one of the factors which persuaded many local people to support the
community trust's bid.''
Trust chairwoman Mrs Aileen Bates said last night there was
''absolutely no question'' of the private sector becoming involved in
the running of the new hospital.
''Under the present guidelines, we are required to explore the
possibility of private finance. It is one of a number of options we are
looking at although at the end of the day it may be that the best
solution is to fund the building from the public purse,'' she said.

RELATIONS between largely Labour controlled Scottish local government
and Tory Ministers at the Scottish Office soured dramatically yesterday
and appeared to be at their worst since Mr Michael Forsyth took over as
Scottish Secretary earlier this year.
A bitter war of words between Cosla's Labour president Mrs Rosemary
McKenna and Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch was being
played out, perhaps significantly, against the backdrop of the Labour
Party conference in Brighton.
In a hard-hitting speech to councillors and officials at Pitlochry,
Mrs McKenna defended local authorities against claims by Tory Ministers
that they were employing too many highly paid staff.
She accused Mr Forsyth and Housing Minister Raymond Robertson of
treating the future of the 300,000 council staff in Scotland as a
''political football'' and of undermining their morale during the vital
period of transition to the new system of unitary authorities.
Mr George Kynoch, however, went on his own offensive, warning of the
Government's growing displeasure over recent ''jobs for the boys'' rows
over some senior appointments to the new councils and spelling out
Ministers' disapproval of the way some councils had awarded so many
councillors such large increases in allowances.
Labour controls most of Scotland's largest local authorities and Mr
Kynoch accused them of acting irresponsibly.
''We have been hearing all this week about Labour in government. What
we are seeing is how Labour in local government acts in Scotland,'' he
said. ''I have a distinct impression that a situation of jobs for the
boys and jobs for the councillors is developing.''
The Minister warned Scottish councillors that they were ''making very
heavy weather of it'' at a time when they were trying to convince the
Government to add #15m to the #36m already awarded for spending on
reorganisation this year. ''We have to be sure that taxpayers' money is
being used wisely,'' he said.
The Cosla president, meanwhile, claimed recent Ministerial attacks on
the number of staff employed by Scottish local authorities were
''misleading and unhelpful''.
There had been claims that Scottish council staffing levels were too
high compared to England, said Mrs McKenna.
''I would ask the question, too high by what standard? England and
Wales where spending per head on public services is 25% lower than
Scotland with the result that three million children are now in classes
of over 30 pupils and last year 3500 teachers were made redundant?''
The Scottish Secretary had suggested the new unitary councils were not
taking the chance of reorganisation to slim down the number of highly
paid staff.
However, Mrs McKenna told the conference, organised by Cosla to look
at the year ahead: ''I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Forsyth
that his research is based on an entirely incomplete picture with
councils throughout Scotland proceeding at their own pace to put in
place structures to provide services to varying populations with varying
needs.''
Mr Forsyth is considering action over complaints and, in some cases,
rumours about job appointments at the new North Lanarkshire Council
which has been passed to him by the Staff Commission.

AN eleventh-hour decision by education chiefs has averted the
possibility of 50 teachers facing disciplinary action for refusing to
teach a pupil who was suspended after using threatening behaviour
against one of them.
The teachers at St Augustine's secondary in Milton, Glasgow -- all
members of teaching union EIS -- told Strathclyde education chiefs they
would refuse to teach the male fourth-year pupil.
The boy was suspended for five days for allegedly threatening to wreck
a female teacher's car and then damage the classroom she taught in.
The 15-year-old pupil, who has not been named, was due back at school
yesterday but there were indications that only the head teacher and one
member of the staff of 54 would teach him.
Education chiefs had intended the boy should start back today. A
spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council admitted that the teachers
could have faced disciplinary action if they refused to teach him.
However, after meetings last night, the region has decided the boy
should not return to school until Mr Tom Macdougall, the depute director
of education, has had a chance to discuss the matter with him and his
mother.
An education authority spokesman said they would be offering the pupil
and his mother a meeting with the depute director of education, in an
attempt to resolve the matter, ''especially as the pupil has now become
the focus of media attention''.
''We will also be meeting with staff at the school to discuss the
matter further with them,'' he said.

THE five-year suspension yesterday of an architect involved in the
Government's housing repair grants scheme has provoked criticism of the
Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and Edinburgh District
Council.
Mr Dennis Graham Rodwell, who now practises in Melrose, was suspended
by the RIAS after he was found guilty of ''behaving in a manner
derogatory to his professional character as an architect.''
Mr Rodwell held funds for proprietors of a tenement property in
Edinburgh. After an RIAS investigation, the organisation claimed it
showed he had failed to provide copies of bank statements and other
statements relating to the money. It also claimed he purported to deduct
fees without the knowledge, agreement and approval of his clients.
Mr Rodwell said he did not accept any of the findings of the RIAS and
contested every point it had made.
The Herald can reveal the case has caused consternation in both
architectural and political circles, with senior figures believing Mr
Rodwell did not get a fair hearing.
A senior Scottish architect told The Herald last night: ''We do not
believe natural justice has prevailed in this case. We felt strongly in
support of Mr Rodwell. He has been treated appallingly. Here we have, by
a process of attrition, a man who has lost business and should have been
given support rather than criticism by his own professional body.''
Feelings were so strong within the profession that the 15-strong
Edinburgh Architectural Association Council passed a motion calling on
its parent body to drop the charges. It was sent to the RIAS but
rejected.
Concern over how the case was handled was also expressed by Edinburgh
District Councillor Gary Coutts, 36, who said the case was ''more like a
witchhunt than an open, honest inquiry''.
Mr Coutts said part of the case against Mr Rodwell had been based on
the repair grants scheme administered by the council. He said he did not
accept the findings of the RIAS.
Mr Coutts said: ''Mr Rodwell has been dealt with appallingly and his
case has been handled very unfairly by the architect's governing body.
The repair grant scheme where people got 90% repair grants for their
tenement properties was more complex to deal with in Edinburgh than in
other places in Scotland.
''The district council reported sixteen architects to the RIAS for all
sorts of things involving administrating the scheme and they were all
found to have done no wrong.
''In the interim, two senior housing officials were suspended at the
council because of the mistakes made in the grant scheme. Mr Rodwell has
done no wrong and dealt with the matter correctly and properly.''
Mr Rodwell said he had received no explanation from the RIAS about the
decision, adding: ''I have consistenly refuted the allegations made
against me and am amazed that they have been able to come to this
decision.
''I feel that I have had little opportunity to defend myself. When the
investigations took place many of the witnesses who would have supported
my interpretation of the events were not allowed to give evidence.
''I have been supported in my attempt to defend myself and to secure a
just finding by prominent members of the profession who, I know, are as
shocked by the RIAS decision as I am.
''As is known, many of the problems I face stem from a long running
dispute with the City of Edinburgh District Council. This matter is as
yet unresolved but their investigations have totally exonerated my
actions.''
The council deputy housing director, Mr Frank Gill, said the complaint
to the RIAS had been on a housing repair grant scheme and had been
logged by individuals. It had nothing to do with the district council.
Mr Sebastian Tombs, secretary of the RIAS, said the complaint had come
from clients regarding the handling of their money. ''The Incorporation
went through the usual disciplinary procedures and dealt with the matter
as we would any which comes to us from a client.''
He said the RIAS could enforce a suspension from the Incorporation but
this did not mean Mr Rodwell had to give up his practice.

WALKERS on the West Highland Way have become big business, leaving an
unexpected economic windfall in their wake, according to a survey
yesterday. However, local hosts must improve their welcome or risk
losing the vast tourist opportunities presented.
A study of the route during 1994, marking its fifteenth year,
estimated the Way earned Scotland an annual #3.5m, resulting in 168
full-time jobs, 126 of which were based within the local economy.
More than 50,000 walkers set foot on the 90-mile pathway from
Milngavie, near Glasgow, to Fort William, which was described as a
fast-expanding international tourist attraction.
Numbers travelling from abroad to do the trek more than tripled to 22%
from 7% in the last surveyed year in 1986. Meanwhile, the proportion of
users who lived locally showed a significant drop, from 51% to 22%.
At the same time, walkers abandoned wild camp sites to use local bed
and breakfast accomodation in their droves (27% compared to 11%),
increasing the amount they spent in the local economy.
However, the survey reported a significant proportion -- 15% -- had
experienced ''some trouble'' with the services with most complaining of
poor facilities and being made to feel unwelcome. Such a pattern was
''highly disturbing'' said the report, which concluded: ''The tradition
of Scottish hospitality is clearly not as widespread as it should be.''
Scottish Natural Heritage, which commissioned the report and is
principal funder of the Way, will now call on area tourist boards and
the local authorities who manage the route to make changes in marketing
and facilities to capitalise on the influx.
The head of SNH's south-west region, Mr Bill Band, said: ''We had no
idea the route's economic impact was so extensive. It will change our
way of thinking about it and the way we talk to those with a
responsibility for tourism. The SNH recommends that the route managing
authorities consider carefully its implications.''
He said the survey was proof of Scotland's growing international
reputation among walkers and the value of long-distance routes. ''People
are now coming to Scotland solely to use the Way which is extremely
important. Within Europe, there really aren't that many places where you
can encounter wild land and expect to meet relatively few people as you
can on the route.''
He stressed the quality of most services and accommodation was
generally high on the Way, blaming a ''specific minority'' for the
visitors' problems.
''Certain proprieters are slow to recognise the financial benefit of
having the Way near them,'' he added. ''One problem may be that the
average walker spend is relatively low -- about #4.22 a day and they are
dismissed as a nuisance by some. Attitudes need to change and walkers,
with their different purses, muddy boots, and wet clothing must be given
a proper welcome and not treated as second-class citizens.''
The Scottish Tourist Board expressed surprise at the earning capacity
of the route, adding that #3.5m rated it as ''very important'' among
leading national tourist sites.
Fort William and Lochaber visitor services officer, Ms Winnie Dick,
said: ''The study gives a very different picture from that shown in
previous estimates. It is exciting news.''
She said her area would now consider producing tourist literature
which was more walker-orientated and put more energy into the
international marketing of the route.
She called for a compulsory accommodation register which laid down
standards for providers on the route. ''At the moment, not all providers
choose to meet the official tourist board grading classification and
there is little we can do about them,'' she said.
While welcoming the recognition given to walkers' economic value, Mr
Dave Morris, of the Scottish Ramblers Association, said some of the
complaints in the report were ''familiar''.
''Scotland has enormous potential to develop this type of tourism but
under promotion by the tourist boards and the attitude of some hosts is
damaging our reputation as a walker destination,'' he added.
Complaints which the association received were of walkers being
separated into designated bars at some hotels, being refused entry with
rucksacks, and being denied washing facilities.
However, SNH remained ''very optimistic'' about the future of the West
Highland Way and planned to market a licensed range of merchandise and
official completion certificates to walkers.
Its main priority was upgrading the route which cost the agency
#140,000 last year. The 100,000 feet which tread the route each year had
caused certain stretches to wear, notably the path along the
north-eastern shore of Loch Lomond where the wet, rough ground was
eroding.
Also projected is a Great Glen Way which would continue the route from
Fort William to Inverness, a proposal which received the support of 87%
of walkers questioned.
However, one reality of the Scottish summer will continue to bite. The
largest single specific complaint, identified by 10% of walkers in the
survey, was the mighty midgie.

A FORMER convict who became infatuated with a prison officer is back
in jail after flouting an order not to go near him.
Wilma Monteith, 54, developed an obsession for Mr Mark Skinner, 28,
and stalked him for eight months after she had been freed from prison.
She claimed that he had promised to marry her.
Last month, Monteith, who is homeless, pleaded with a sheriff to send
her back to prison so she could be near Mr Skinner after she was caught
following him.
Her plea was rejected and she was bailed and given six months to prove
she could leave Mr Skinner alone.
However, Monteith has now had her wish granted after being jailed for
30 days and sent to Cornton Vale Prison, Stirling, where Mr Skinner
works.
The court heard she had turned up at a pub where Mr Skinner was
enjoying a drink.
Mr Skinner was in the hotel in Bridge of Allan, near Stirling, on
Friday when he noticed Monteith hanging about in the car park.
Later she appeared at a window and tried to attract his attention.
She was asked to leave and when she refused police were called and she
was arrested.
Sentencing her, Sheriff Brian Murphy said: ''I find this most
unsatisfactory. All I can do is give her 30 days because she is of no
fixed abode.''
Her lawyer, Mr John Barr, said it was Monteith's birthday on Friday
and she had decided to go in search of Mr Skinner to give herself a
treat despite knowing she was in breach of a bail order.
Outside court, friends said Monteith had gone looking for Mr Skinner
in the hope of getting a birthday kiss.
At an earlier hearing, Stirling Sheriff Court heard how she claimed Mr
Skinner had promised to marry her after they met while she was in
prison.
The court was told Mr Skinner had shown kindness to Monteith while she
was serving a three-month sentence for breach of the peace.
However, after she was released in December last year, she began
stalking him, following him into pubs and to his work.
Monteith got to know Mr Skinner's routine so well that she even knew
which buses he used to get to and from work.
In August, Mr Skinner walked into Bannockburn police station after
hearing her calling his name as he was strolling down a street.
As she waited outside, officers arrested her.
Monteith told her lawyer that she met Mr Skinner while serving time
for tormenting the family of missing Falkirk teenager Vicky Hamilton
with a letter claiming to have met her in Blackpool.
Mr Skinner was not available for comment yesterday.

Meanwhile, Highlands and Islands Minister George Kynoch was in

areas. It is hoped the three-year initiative will include up to 250
projects with upgrading of accommodation in hotels, guest houses, bed
and breakfasts, bunk houses, and caravan sites, along with improved
facilities for the disabled.
Of the total sum, #3m is coming from the European Objective One
programme and #3m from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The balance is
expected to come from the tourist industry itself, from the hotels or
guest houses which embark on projects.
They can expect grants ranging from 30% to 70% with the higher level
for remote areas and areas of greatest need. HIE estimates that between
400 and 500 jobs could be created by the scheme, HIE Standards.

<HEADLINE>Islands council executive claims damages from ex-pilot over petrol bill accusations. Pensioner sued for #30,000</HEADLINE>

THE chief executive of Orkney Islands Council is claiming #30,000
damages from a bankrupt local pensioner who called him a thief and liar
over a #30 petrol bill.
The allegations against Mr Ronald Gilbert were made in a letter sent
to colleagues on the council and repeated in a poster in a shop window
in Stromness.
The man who made the claims, Mr Hugh Yorston, a former Spitfire pilot,
is defending the action and insists that what he said in the letter and
poster is true.
During a legal debate at the Court of Session yesterday, Lord
Macfadyen was told that the legal action stemmed from an incident in
April 1993, when Mr Gilbert, of High Tor, Annfield Crescent, Kirkwall,
called at the local Deerness Stores to buy petrol.
At the time, he was the council's director of finance as well as chief
executive.
In his action, Mr Gilbert explains that, as a result of a misreading
of the petrol pump he mistakenly underpaid the store by #26.40 pounds.
However, the error was corrected later that day and the outstanding
balance paid.
About a month later, Mr Yorston, of Victoria Street Stromness, wrote a
letter to the convener, vice-convener, and director of administration of
Orkney Islands Council. The letter was headed: ''Fraud, lies, and theft
at executive level.''
It stated: ''I have some regret and pleasure to report a premeditated
and indeed calculated underhand transaction as conducted by your
director of finance and chief executive.''
Mr Gilbert says the letter suggested that he had deliberately and
dishonestly obtained the petrol without paying the full price and was
intended to convey to its readers that he was generally of a dishonest
character.
He claims it was also intended to suggest that he was not worthy of
public trust and confidence in the administration of funds under his
control as director of finance.
Following the letter, Mr Yorston, who is in his 70s, posted a notice
in a shop window in Stromness along with a photograph of the chief
executive.
Mr Gilbert says the notice further impugned his honesty by stating:
''Due to a misdemeanour of his own doing, he (Mr Gilbert) showed himself
to be in the first place a liar and in the second place a thief.''
It was placed prominently in the window of the shop which is in a busy
street, where it was seen by many local residents.
The chief executive alleges that the notice falsely represented to its
readers that he had been guilty of financial dishonesty in the discharge
of his public duties as chief executive and director of finance.
The case went before Lord Macfadyen yesterday for a legal debate to
establish what exactly Mr Yorston's defences to the action are. He is
conducting his own case and the written legal pleadings he has drafted
were said to be difficult to understand.
The pensioner, who was born in Orkney, has lived in Australia since
1950 but returns to this country each year and lives in Stromness from
June until November.
He told the judge yesterday that he did not deny writing the letter or
posting the notice in the shop window. He added: ''I made the
allegations that Mr Gilbert is a liar and a thief.''
Lord Macfadyen explained that what was being alleged in the case was
that these claims were untrue and defamatory.
Mr Yorston replied: ''Everything I stated, I stand by completely. It's
true 100%. He paid #3.60 when he should have paid #30.''
The judge said he was satisfied that Mr Yorston was putting forward a
defence that his allegations were true and that the case should go
forward to a full hearing of evidence at a later date.
Miss Leeona Dorrian QC, counsel for Mr Gilbert, asked for the expenses
of yesterday's hearing to be awarded against Mr Yorston and Lord
Macfadyen agreed.
Mr Yorston commented: ''I have been declared a bankrupt and I could
not care less about the expenses.''

<HEADLINE>US scientists warn of risks from electrical goods and power lines. Cancer 'link' in the home</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976044350</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
POWER lines and household appliances like vacuum cleaners pose a
hidden health threat which could increase the risk of cancer and
degenerative diseases, according to a group of scientists.
They have produced a report for the US Government, in which there are
warnings about Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and leukemia risks for
children.
The leaked report from the US National Council on Radiation Protection
recommends safety limits for exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs)
which are 8000 times lower than the current British standard.
EMFs are produced by all electrical appliances and most strongly by
electric power lines. The claims, therefore, could have huge
implications for the electricity industry and society.
The report, an early draft which was leaked to journalists, took nine
years to compile by 11 experts. It focuses on studies suggesting that
EMFs might cause hormonal changes in the body which could be linked to
cancer and degenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
Children exposed to fields from power lines may be at greater risk of
developing leukemia and adults exposed to EMFs at work could be more
likely to develop leukemia and brain cancer, it was claimed.
Other studies indicated that low exposure might help tumours to grow
by causing genetic or chemical damage to cells.
According to the report, the evidence of long-term effects on human
health was now so strong that EMF safety limits should take them into
account.
The experts recommend a safety limit of 0.2 microteslas, the
measurement of EMFs. This is a very weak field exceeded by many
household appliances and power lines: standing 30cm away from a vacuum
cleaner or electric drill will expose a person to between two and 20
microteslas.
Food mixers produce 0.6-10 microteslas, hair driers 0.01 to seven,
dishwashers 0.6 to three, and washing machines 0.15 to three.
Exposure immediately below a 400 kilovolt power line is 40
microteslas.
The British equivalent of the NCRP, the National Radiological
Protection Board (NRPB), recommends a safety limit of 1600 microteslas.
However, this does not recognise that electromagnetic fields are in any
way causally linked with cancer or other diseases.
The NCRP findings were highlighted in the latest issue of New
Scientist.
The magazine quoted the reports' authors as saying if their
recommendations were accepted it could force ''complex and costly''
changes to society's use of electricity.
Officials of the US Environmental Protection Agency, which funded the
report, said the study was the most comprehensive undertaken on the
health effects of EMFs.
However, the president of the NCRP, Mr Charles Meinhold, said that
because the report was a leaked draft version it had ''absolutely no
standing at this time''.
Mr John Stather, general assistant director at the NRPB, said there
was still no proof that electromagnetic radiation could trigger cancer.
''Our advisory group has taken the view that the epidemiological
studies which show an association between EMFs and cancer do not
establish a causal relationship,'' he said. ''Our view is that there is
no plausible biological mechanism to indicate that EMFs can effect any
of the accepted stages of carcinogenesis.''
Despite this, Professor Gordon McVie, scientific director of the
Cancer Research Campaign, called for full details of the research to be
released as soon as possible so other experts can test its validity.
''It's a hot issue and plenty of people have claimed their cancers
were caused by electricity, but causality has not been proved,'' he
said.
He added: ''Even if we get the evidence, that doesn't mean you can get
people to accept the social changes, as we have seen with smoking. There
is far more proof to link diet to cancer than electricity.''
Mr Nick Kembery, a spokesman for the National Grid, said it was too
early to comment on the significance of the US research.
Ms Kay Hand, spokeswoman for the Electricity Association, which
represents Britain's major electricity companies, said: ''There have
been many, many studies both here and abroad, but none of them has
proved any definite causal link. Nevertheless, we continue to keep
abreast of any research being done, and of course we will look at this
report very seriously.''

STUDENTS at Stirling University are to vote on whether they want
Prince Edward to be their next honorary president.
The prince confirmed that he would take the job after his name was put
forward by the administrator of the university drama society, third-year
student Janet Lascelles.
He is facing a strong local challenge from the only other contender,
mature student Ben Goodwin.
Mr Graham Mannering, spokesman for the university students'
association, said yesterday: ''The honorary president is a figurehead
more than anything else but he does hold one of only two votes the
students have on the ruling body, the university court.
''He should really attend four times a year, to represent our
interests.''
The track record of past honorary presidents has been patchy.
The retiring office holder, Radio One DJ Pete Tonge, never set foot on
the campus, though he did give students a mention on air.
Before that, Alex Patterson of the ambient dance band The Orb gave a
concert on campus.
Most active of recent honorary presidents is said to have been Jack
McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, a Stirling
Distict Councillor at the time he held office.
Polling will take place on October 17.

A SCHEME enabling young people to attend arts events at greatly
reduced prices has been launched in Scotland, 40 years after it began in
London.
Stage Pass is a credit-card style scheme operated by Youth &amp; Music,
which claims to be Britain's leading organisation in the field of youth
audience development, and is aimed at 14 to 30-year-olds.
Membership of the scheme costs #9.50 and entitles the holder to
discounts of up to 60% on tickets for theatre, opera, concerts, and
ballet.
Participating organisations include Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet,
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra,
all the main theatres in Glasgow and Edinburgh, the Edinburgh
International Festival and Fringe, and Glasgow International Jazz
Festival.
Card holders can buy an additional ticket at the reduced rate and
receive a regular magazine guide to what's on across the country. Young
Scots who want to join the scheme can do so at the Assembly Rooms,
King's Theatre, and Usher Hall in Edinburgh, or the Tron Theatre in
Glasgow.
Youth &amp; Music director Alan Fluck said yesterday that the Stage Pass
scheme had grown incredibly over recent years, with 300,000 tickets
being sold.
Presenting honorary memberships to Mari Stevens and Ewan MacLeod,
presenters of Scottish Television's Chart Bite, he said: ''We want to
encourage the habit of going to the arts on a regular and committed
basis.''
Meanwhile, the arts are now firmly established as an integral element
in all aspects of Glasgow life, according to the city's museums
department.
The claim follows publication of statistics gathered in an independent
report that show that arts and culture attractions are now the number
one factor in attracting visitors to the city.
They also confirm that Glasgow's cultural market is the fastest
growing in the UK and that only London and Edinburgh attract more
overseas visitors.
The Digest of Cultural Statistics, compiled by the London-based John
Myerscough research company, show that the cultural section, including
cinemas, theatres, museums, and art galleries, are now worth about #420m
to Glasgow's economy -- an increase of more than 40% on the mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE>Rangers give pledge to stand by grassroot supporters</HEADLINE>

RANGERS chairman David Murray yesterday denied that he is about to
sacrifice loyal, grassroot supporters in favour of big-spending
corporate entertainers to boost the Ibrox coffers even further.
He insisted that the ''ordinary fan'' will not be abandoned in the
drive to increase turnover, and was equally adamant the price of a
season ticket, working out at #10 a game, was the maximum his market can
bear at this time.
Mr Murray's comments came after publication of the club's annual
report, which showed Rangers have returned to the black -- recording a
pre-tax profit of #271,000 compared with a #2.2m loss last year.
Profits were further boosted this year by a tax credit of #184,000
because of the surrender of prior years' tax losses to group companies.
The bottom line profit therefore was #455,000.
In a statement accompanying the report, Mr Murray acknowledged that
''full use'' of executive facilities at Ibrox has now been reached.
He said growth in the executive area will now ''require examination of
a new and wider range of opportunities''.
Mr Ross Wilson, a financial consultant to football clubs south of the
Border, suggested that was a clear signal it is accepted that growth in
turnover from attendances at the stadium was now finite.
He added: ''It could also suggest a real conflict may arise between
the football supporter and the corporate entertainer, if the club
decided the way forward to boost income was to sacrifice the fan in
favour of bigger spenders.''
Mr Murray admitted later there was no spare corporate capacity at
Ibrox, but insisted that the ordinary fan will not be removed from seats
to make way for executive facilities.
He said the rise in stadium capacity to 51,000 -- by spending #4m on
corner developments during the current season -- is aimed at supporters,
currently faced with a 9000-strong waiting list. He forecast the number
of season ticket holders will stand at some 40,000 next year.
According to the annual report, turnover in the 12 months to May 31
soared from #15.8m to #18.9m -- driven largely by capacity crowds at
most home games, and thanks also to growing commercial activities.
Turnover from football stood at #10.5m, with commercial turnover put
at #5.9m. Catering was worth another #2.1m, while rentals brought in
#225,000.
However, Rangers' financial performance paled when compared with
Manchester United who, 24 hours earlier, revealed turnover had spiralled
from #43.8m to #60.6m with pre-tax profits almost doubled from #10.8m to
#20m.
Mr Murray said later that United's average ticket price is #18, and
that the Manchester club had received #6.8m from television compared
with Rangers' average entrance fee of #10 and television income of just
#800,000.
He added: ''We still recorded a turnover of more than #18m, even
without income from the Champion's League. This season, we are budgeting
for a turnover of #25m.''
The Rangers' accounts do not include the #9.7m spent during the summer
on bringing in Paul Gascoigne from Lazio, Oleg Salenko from Valencia,
Gordon Petric from Dundee United, and Stephen Wright from Aberdeen.
Since then, only #3m has been recovered from transfers, with Basil Boli
going to Monaco and Mark Hateley to Queen's Park Rangers.
The accounts reveal interest charges have more than doubled to
#1,096,000, and staff costs continue to escalate. The wages bill, up
from #7.6m to #8.4m, equals some 44.5% of total turnover.
No breakdown of individual wages was provided, but directors'
remunerations show the highest paid board member -- presumed to be
manager Walter Smith -- received #127,000, an increase of #2000 on the
previous year.
Much of the 1994 deficit was blamed on the club's defeat in the first
round of the European Champions' Cup.
Although a similar early exit was recorded in the year to May, Rangers
still managed to record an overall trading profit of #1.7m.
Debts now stand at #33.3m compared with #26.3m the year before.
The club's net assets are put at #43m, with intangibles -- including
players -- quoted at #20m.

SCOTTISH Housing Minister Raymond Robertson said yesterday he hoped
the day would come when Scottish councils would no longer be direct
providers of rented housing.
He insisted the tradition of councils supplying housing for local
people must not be allowed to stand in the way of progress.
At a conference in Edinburgh, where he made his first major speech on
housing since being appointed to the Scottish Office team earlier this
year, the Minister urged the new unitary councils to break the mould and
adopt a policy of large scale transfers of stock to alternative
landlords.
So far only one authority, Berwickshire, has transferred all its
properties to a new housing association. Approval was given by the
Scottish Office last August.
''I regard this transfer as a very significant milestone and have no
doubt that such transfers represent an effective way to achieve real
improvements in Scotland's housing stock,'' he told the conference.
Greater involvement of the private sector was essential to improve the
quality of housing, he said. Transfers were one way to increase
investment, as councils could use any surplus from the receipts to
reinvest in remaining stock or to improve their role as enablers rather
than providers.
He also told delegates at the conference, organised by the Chartered
Institute of Housing, Shelter, and Cosla, that councils should make more
use of the Private Finance Initiative to meet housing needs.
Mr Robertson, in what some saw as a veiled threat, added: ''The extent
to which authorities are pursuing private investment will certainly be
an important consideration in our minds when the Secretary of State and
I come to decide on the capital allocations to authorities.''
Edinburgh's Labour Housing convener, Ms Mary Mulligan, said she was
appalled by some of what she had heard. Transferring council stock to
other landlords would not help the problem of homelessness or of people
living in intolerable conditions. What was needed was more rented
housing, she said.

A DRUGS crackdown by police in Fife has prevented cannabis with a
potential value of #500,000 from reaching the streets.
Operation Chopper has caught growers and dealers off guard and
uncovered six factories producing cannabis in the last two weeks.
Hundreds of cannabis plants have been seized in raids on houses, and at
least six people have been arrested, with more predicted.
A senior officer warned that the pressure will be maintained until
they are satisfied they have curbed the recent trend of mass cultivation
of cannabis in home-based factories.
Detective Chief Inspector John Nicholson, head of Western Division
CID, said: ''We have had good success in raids on houses over the last
few weeks and are now focusing our attention on other addressess.''
He warned: ''We are determined to stamp out this increasing trend of
commercial cultivation. Drug growers and dealers can expect a knock on
their door at any time.''
Revealing that in some cases as many as 60 plants were being grown
using a sophisticated hydroponic system, Mr Nicholson said: ''We do not
believe anyone cultivating plants in this way is doing so for personal
use.''
''They will be charged with possession with intent to supply, which
could lead to an appearance before the High Court and a custodial
sentence of up to five years.''
Meanwhile, drugs worth around #8m -- which police believed were
destined for Scotland -- were recovered yesterday after an undercover
police operation in London. Strathclyde Police said later there was no
evidence to support the Scottish connection theory.
Two million capsules of Temazepam were found on a lorry at an
industrial estate in Feltham.
Police said later that a 52-year-old London man had been charged in
connection with the find.
* Liza Alexander, formerly of Mayfield Road, Saltcoats, was jailed for
12 years at Croydon Crown Court yesterday, for her part in an attempt to
smuggle nearly #1.5m worth of cocaine into the UK.
She was found guilty of the illegal importation of more than 13 kilos
of the drug from Barbados.

DIVING company Coflexip Stena has admitted that human error was to
blame for the first accident in North Sea diving operations for 11
years.
In August, The Herald exclusively revealed that the investigation into
the death of Mr Bradley Westell, 29, centred on how his umbilical cord,
which provides lifeline services, could have been caught by one of the
thrusters on the mother ship if the regulations were being adhered to.
It was also disclosed that the possibility of manslaughter charges
being brought against company personnel was being considered as a result
of the incident on July 31 during cable laying 60 miles off Norfolk.
At that stage, the company declined to comment until the HSE
investigation was complete.
However, it has now confirmed that more umbilical had been paid out
than was permitted because staff had been diverted from normal
operational procedures and that ''we have not yet got to the bottom of
why those procedures were not followed''.
A number of staff had been suspended ''as is normal after a serious
breach of procedures is suspected and pending the outcome of an
investigation''.

AN invasion of spiders has forced the closure of a school for three
days and given delighted youngsters an extra holiday while the creatures
are dealt with by a pest-control firm.
About a dozen of the spiders -- identified as coming originally from
the Canary Islands and being slightly poisonous -- have been found at
Bembridge Church of England school on the Isle of Wight.
Headmaster Harry Kirby said the alert first started at the beginning
of the summer holidays, when a woman staff member cleaning out a
cupboard felt something on her shoulder. She brushed it off and was
bitten by the spider.
Several weeks ago, the woman identified another spider as being of the
same type.
It was caught and sent to the environmental health department which
forwarded it to Cambridge University where it was identified as an adult
female steatoda noblis, a slightly poisonous spider native to the Canary
Islands, said Mr Kirby.
The school, which has 117 children aged between five and nine, was
told that the creature's bites were not dangerous unless there was
secondary infection.
Normally, the experts said, the spiders -- black and shiny with a
bulbous body about half an inch long -- were found only in one and twos,
although they were becoming established along the south coast.
However, Mr Kirby said he found about a dozen after looking for them
and moving heavy items in the school. ''They are quite nasty looking,''
he said. ''When I see a normal English spider, I think 'Oh, that's a
friendly one'.''

A MACHETE-wielding highwayman roamed England, robbing petrol stations,
a court heard yesterday.
Glaswegian Joseph Currie frightened the cashiers out of their wits,
York Crown Court was told.
He admitted four robberies and two attempts and was jailed for five
years.
In one raid at the Knavesmire Garage in York, cashier Maureen Dawson
ignored Currie's demands for cash and dialled 999.
The man in a white motorcycle helmet told her he had a machete and
would return to petrol bomb the place, said Mr James Hyland,
prosecuting.
Mr Hyland said Currie, 30, of no fixed address, but who was educated
at Holyrood School, Glasgow, toured Britain in a stolen car, picking out
petrol stations run only by vulnerable women.
He struck them all within the space of a few days last November and
used the white helmet each time as a disguise.
He boasted he was well known ''for doing petrol stations all over the
place''.
Mr Hyland said the vigilance of two policeman in Harrogate resulted in
Currie being caught as he attempted to rob the Oakdale Thrust Service
Station in the town's Ripon Road.
Mrs Jean Atkinson was the lone cashier and the officers, who were
passing in a patrol car, saw a man in a helmet acting suspiciously. They
were able to apprehend Currie but by the time they did he had dumped his
helmet and jacket and he told them he knew nothing.
Mr Hyland said a car, stolen in the Midlands, was parked on the
forecourt and keys recovered from Currie's pocket fitted its ignition.
Currie exercised his right to silence throughout.
Mr Thomas Bayliss, defending, said Currie's crimes were far from
sophisticated. Throughout, he wore the same crash helmet as a trademark
and undoubtedly badly frightened his victims.
Jailing Currie, who also admitted burglary at trade premises in
Birmingham, Judge Tom Cracknell said: ''You embarked on a spree of
robberies at petrol stations, picking vulnerable women in each case.
''You subjected them to an absolutely terrifying experience and there
will have to be a substantial sentence.'' He commended the two policeman
for their good work and their superior for linking all the robberies.

MASS protests and marches against three ''villain'' brothers followed
a spate of shootings, the High Court in Glasgow was told yesterday.
The Murdoch family was forced to leave their home town of Craigneuk,
Lanarkshire, as a result, the court was told.
The three Murdoch brothers, William, 30, Alan, 29, and John, 34, were
all shot in separate incidents. John, the court heard, was left
paralysed.
Giving evidence yesterday against three men accused of trying to kill
William and Alan, their father Mr David Murdoch, 57, admitted that his
three sons were villains.
He also revealed that, in addition to being shot, a hand grenade had
been thrown through the window of William's home at Golfhill Road,
Craigneuk, in an earlier incident.
Three men on trial are accused of attempting to murder William and
Alan in separate alleged shooting incidents last year. Mr William
Longmire, 32, and Mr John McNeil, 27, deny an alleged murder attempt on
Mr William Murdoch at his home on May 3.
The charges allege they also attempted to murder a six-year-old boy, a
14-year-old girl, and a friend of the family in the same incident.
Mr Longmire, Mr McNeil, and a third accused, Mr Derek McCreaddie, 19,
also deny murdering Mr Douglas Bryce, 21, near his home in Meadowhead
Road, Craigneuk, on August 25, by repeatedly shooting him.
They are also alleged to have shot Mr Alan Murdoch in a murder attempt
on the same day.
All three have special defences of alibi and Mr Longmire and Mr McNeil
have a special defence blaming the murder on Mr Alan Murdoch.
In evidence, the 14-year-old girl told Mr Michael O'Grady,
prosecuting, how she was playing with the six-year-old boy in William
Murdoch's front garden when three shots ran out, one hitting the wall
near the front door. She grabbed the boy and took him inside.
Mr William Murdoch's wife, Carol Ann, 31, said she saw a car,
containing Mr Longmire and Mr McNeil, draw up outside her house. Mr
Longmire, she alleged, held a handgun in both hands and fired three
shots.
Cross-examined by Donald Findlay, QC, she denied that the Murdoch
family were ''motivated by sheer malice'' and that she had named Mr
Longmire and Mr McNeill to settle a few old scores against the Murdoch
brothers' enemies.
The trial before Lord Dawson continues.

A SCOTTISH university professor will be honoured in Paris today and
presented with a #100,000 prize for a discovery which he believes will
lead to a cure for cancer in his lifetime.
Professor David Lane accompanied by his wife Birgitte, also an
internationally renowned professor and cancer researcher, is to be the
guest of honour at a ceremony in the Curie Institute to be attended by
President Jacques Chirac.
Professor Lane, 43, is the first person to be awarded the Yvette
Mayent Prize, which is intended to become ''the Nobel prize of cancer
research''. The award has been made for his discovery of p53, a
substance which protects the body from cells damaged by radiation,
tobacco smoke and other cancer causing agents.
To add to his distinction, the Cancer Research Campaign in Britain
announced a #5m research funding boost for his department at the
University of Dundee.
The discovery of p53 is so significant that last year two thousand
scientific papers were published on the subject worldwide.
When p53 is undamaged and working properly it suppresses tumours by
stopping cancerous cells from dividing and helps to kill them off. It
has been found that p53 is present in tumours which respond well to
therapy, but is absent or damaged in tumours which are difficult to
treat.
Last night Professor Lane said: ''It is a great honour to receive this
prize. When we made the initial discovery of p53 we suspected it was
something big. But we did not appreciate its full significance.''
Clinical trials are now under way in the US to develop drugs which
will simulate the action of p53 in killing off rogue cells.
The professor added: ''I am optimistic that the work on p53 will lead
to a cancer cure, or at least radically improved treatments, within my
lifetime.''
He welcomed the announcement of the #5m in funding. ''This is further
confirmation of Dundee University's ever-growing importance as an
internationally-recognised cancer research centre.''
Professor Lane and his wife, who heads a research group into skin and
gland cancers, live near St Andrews. They have two children, Amelia,
nine, and Oliver, 12.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Opera likely to lose its orchestra in arts shake-up</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Opera is likely to be advised to disband its orchestra in a
bid to solve the company's cash crisis, it emerged last night.
Speculation over the company's future comes days before a Scottish
Arts Council-organised working party reports on the future of the
opera's orchestra, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra.
The working party, chaired by Sir Lewis Robertson, was set up in May
to investigate ways in which the three orchestras could collaborate to
save money.
With no increase in the opera's Scottish Arts Council annual grant of
#4.7m over the next three years, it is predicted that the report will
ask Scottish Opera to disband its own orchestra and instead call upon
the Royal SNO and the chamber orchestra.
Yesterday, the broadcasting union Bectu, the Musicians' Union, and
Equity held a meeting with opera director Richard Jarman at the Labour
Party conference in Brighton.
The recommendation to disband the orchestra would certainly be opposed
by the unions, with the Musicians' Union arguing that the orchestra
should remain an intregal part of the company. The move is also likely
to be opposed by the opera's board.
It has already emerged that in the face of stand-still funding and a
reported loss of #1m last year, Scottish Opera prefers the option of
going part-time. Equity, which represents 40 singers, said it would
oppose that proposal.
Equity also dismissed a suggestion by Bectu to sell the Theatre Royal
in Glasgow, which is owned by Scottish Opera, as a way of solving the
company's cash crisis. It is understood that idea has already been ruled
out by Mr Jarman in a recent private letter to Bectu.
Equity's Scottish organiser, Mr Drew McFarlane, said the #5m raised
from such a sale would be only a stop-gap measure. ''A sell-off would
only prop up Scottish Opera for two years. Scottish Opera is
under-funded in comparison with other national organisations. Its future
funding is really a matter for the Scottish Office.''
Bectu, which represents around half of Scottish Opera's 230 members,
criticised the way in which the theatre was managed, saying it should be
hired out when there were no performances rather than be used as a
rehearsal venue.
An arts council spokesman remained circumspect in the face of
speculation. He would only add that the report was in the final stages
of preparation and would be made public tomorrow. ''SAC continues to
discuss future funding with all major clients.''
An official of Scottish Opera said the company would be happy to
discuss its options after the working party report was published
tomorrow.

A MAJOR corporate supporter of the Scottish Conservatives has
withdrawn its financial backing from the party following a move by its
former chairman, one of the country's leading Tories.
Hewden Stuart, Britain's biggest plant hire group, has dropped its
annual donation to the Tory Party, which last year amounted to #7500.
However, the blow is more severe than it may appear in financial
terms. The decision was prompted by the company's ex-chairman, Sir
Matthew Goodwin, a former treasurer of both the Scottish Conservative
Party and the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association.
The Glasgow based firm's new chairman, Mr Sandy Findlay, said
yesterday Sir Matthew had written before his retirement on June 8 that
he could not recommend to the board that the contribution be continued.
A specific irritation was that the plant hire industry has to pay a
licence on load-all plant of #150, whereas the farmer who uses a vehicle
which is virtually identical pays just #35.
Hewden Stuart has a fleet of about 4000 load-alls. It is thought this
tax was the last straw.
Mr Findlay, who has worked with Sir Matthew for almost all his career
in a company acknowledged as being the world leader in plant hire,
added: ''We are not giving charity to the Conservative Party. Our job is
to enhance shareholder value.
''No sort of donation to the Conservative Party would necessarily
enhance shareholder value.''
The decision was made on Tuesday when the half-time profit figures
were being approved by the board.
It is believed that influential figures in the Scottish Tory Party had
several times made representations to Treasury Ministers about the
damage the tax was doing to the plant hire industry and on an apparent
miscalculation by the Treasury as to the level of revenue expected.
One source said the Hewden Stuart move was prompted by the
Government's refusal to listen.
Conservative Central Office in London said it naturally regretted any
company ceasing to make donations and hoped Hewden Stuart would
reconsider.
Neither Scottish Conservative Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst nor
deputy Annabel Goldie were available for comment on the Hewden Stuart
withdrawal last night. A party spokesperson said she could not confirm
the withdrawal and declined to comment further.
In 1991, before the rows over executive pay, Sir Matthew took a 37%
cut as chairman of Hewden Stuart after his company posted a 30% drop in
profits. He said directors and senior managers could not expect bonuses
in such circumstances.
The last Labour Research survey of political donations, published last
December, showed that the Conservative Party was suffering a dramatic
fall in corporate cash gifts, although Tory Party chairman Brian
Mawhinney has recently claimed company donations are increasing again.
The findings, from what is the most comprehensive analysis of
Conservative Party funding outside of Conservative Central Office, were
in stark contrast to the growing number of unions reaffirming their
political funds through which they finance the Labour Party.
Having surveyed around 5000 UK companies, Labour Research concluded
that the year ended March 1994 saw the lowest number of corporate
donations to the Tories, amounting to one of the smallest totals.
Only 168 companies made donations, the lowest number traced by Labour
Research. They donated a total of #2.5m, the third lowest sum given
during the Thatcher-Major years.
This compared with #3.76m in 1991 (1992 was not used as a comparison
because, being an election year, there were many one-off payments from
companies which do not normally contribute to Tory funds).

LABOUR leader Tony Blair's modernisation programme stormed ahead at
the party's annual conference in Brighton yesterday.
Delegates overwhelmingly backed health and transport policies, with
only the education package threatening to upset the bandwagon effect as
former deputy leader Roy Hattersley made a fierce attack on policy
direction.
Mr Hattersley won a standing ovation with a denunciation of the
limited reforms being proposed for grant-maintained schools.
However, delegates overwhelmingly backed the party's policy paper,
Diversity and Excellence, and in another vote a rebel motion against its
proposals was heavily defeated.
On transport, Labour promised to halt rail privatisation in its tracks
and lure more train passengers by lowering fares.
But Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher did not go as far as
using the word ''renationalisation''.
Rail experts later commented they felt Labour would be able to run a
part-public, part-private network while still fulfilling Mr Blair's
pledge of a publicly owned and publicly accountable rail system.
Shadow Health Secretary Margaret Beckett won a standing ovation with
her keynote speech, insisting she would not accept the Conservatives'
vision of the future for the NHS -- ''not while I live and breathe''.
Meanwhile, one of Mr Blair's most trusted aides, Peter Mandelson,
warned the party against complacency when he said it was facing the
''most hard-fought, knock-down fight of our political lives''.

O J SIMPSON, enjoying his first full day of freedom after 15 months in
jail, said in an interview yesterday that he needs time to grieve for
his slain ex-wife.
The former American footballer remained firmly behind closed doors,
but in a phone conversation with a Cable News Network producer, the star
was quoted as saying he was happy about his acquittal on Tuesday on
charges of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.
''But I haven't had a chance to grieve,'' Simpson reportedly said.
''Yesterday there was a festive mood at the house, but at the same time,
my kids don't have a mother. People don't seem to understand that I
loved that woman.''
Simpson spoke from his Brentwood mansion, where he arrived on Tuesday
after being freed at the end of his year-long trial.
Meanwhile, jurors who cleared him of murder charges began speaking
out, saying they found too many holes in the prosecution's case against
him.
One juror told her daughter she thinks Simpson probably is guilty, but
voted to acquit because the fiasco over a racist investigator torpedoed
the prosecution's case.
Anise Aschenbach, one of two white jurors on the panel, made the
comments in a telephone conversation with her daughter, the ABC network
reported, identifying the daughter only as Denise.
''She said, 'I think he probably did do it, Denise,''' the daughter
said. ''I said something like, 'Gosh, you're kidding me.' And she said,
'No,' and she's crying. So I said: 'Why? What happened?'
''She said it was because there wasn't enough evidence. And I said,
'Why?' She said, 'Because of Mark Fuhrman.'''
Fuhrman was the detective who found key evidence used against Simpson
but was revealed to have lied on the witness stand about using racial
epithets.
The verdict by the jury of nine blacks, two whites and one Hispanic,
was arrived at in just four hours and brought mixed results.
Most blacks interviewed said they agreed with the verdicts, while the
majority of whites expressed shock and indignation at the jury's
findings.
Adding to the fireworks, Simpson's high-priced legal ''dream team''
appeared to be coming apart at the seams in a bitter public disagreement
over whether it was right to make race the overriding theme of the
defence strategy.
But the apparent split was perhaps the last thing on Simpson's mind as
he began readjusting to life on the outside after spending 474 days
largely confined to a maximum-security cell.
A family spokesman said Simpson was ''very tired'' and was resting
inside his Brentwood mansion.
Simpson has reportedly made contact with his children -- six-year-old
Justin and eight-year-old Sydney -- and the Brown family hinted that
they would likely give up custody without a fight.
With the world waiting anxiously for the former footballer to speak,
long-time friend Bob Kardashian said Simpson wants to tell his story
''very soon'' and will probably do so in a pay-per-view TV interview --
an appearance that marketing experts say channels are now negotiating.
Some of the jurors are also hoping to cash in.
In a glimpse into the inner workings of the mostly black jury, one
panellist said the panel was disturbed about signs that police
investigators mishandled crucial blood evidence. He said the defence
''race card'' rated ''barely a blip'' with the jury.
Another juror, Brenda Moran, told reporters ''I think we did the right
thing'' and denied a rush to judgment. A secret straw poll taken an hour
after deliberations began Monday showed a 10-2 vote in favour of
acquittal and that the jurors soon narrowed their differences.
Most legal analysts said Simpson's attorneys prevailed with the jury
by skilfully playing the race card.
''I felt I and every other black man in America was on trial, because
we know exactly the kind of mistreatment O J faced,'' said a postal
worker in South Central Los Angeles.
However, many white Americans expressed shock that the jurors had
ignored what prosecutors described as a mountain of physical evidence
linking Simpson to the murders.

PLANS for a St Andrew's Day launch to unveil the full details of a
devolved Scottish parliament were thrown into turmoil last night when
the general council of the STUC described the proposal to have 129
members as unacceptable.
That figure had been arrived at during a personal deal struck by
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, for Labour, and Scottish
Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace as a compromise between the favoured
positions of both parties.
One STUC source yesterday described the deal as a piece of ''political
expediency'' which could not be supported.
However, last night Mr Robertson insisted that the process would
remain on track and that they would not fail to deliver an agreed scheme
by November 30.
He believed that once the merits and arguments for a 129-member
parliament were explained the STUC would come back on board.
Labour had wanted a legislature of just 113 members -- 73 MSPs
representing the existing Westminster constituencies plus an extra one
to give Orkney and Shetland separate representation and then five
members from each of the eight European constituencies elected from
party lists to create a system of proportional representation.
Instead of 40 additional members, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had
wanted 72, arguing that this would make true proportionality more
attainable. This stance also earned the support of women in both parties
who were seeking gender equality at the body on Calton Hill in
Edinburgh.
There was some surprise when Mr Robertson and Mr Wallace sprang their
compromise deal -- exactly splitting the difference between their
proposals -- and there were murmurings at the time of a political
carve-up, which was more typical of the Westminster way of doing
business than the new style being proposed for the Scottish parliament.
However, the SLD, having run the numbers through a complex computer
program, concluded that a 129-member parliament would be sufficient to
achieve good proportionality.
Then came yesterday's STUC bombshell. The general council declared
itself ''bitterly disappointed'' by the proposals. General secretary
Campbell Christie said the plans as they stood were unacceptable. ''We
are therefore bitterly disappointed that some of our key principles are
in danger of being lost in the current debate.''
He did not believe that a parliament as small as that proposed could
bring about equal representation of men and women, nor reflect the
diversity of Scotland's communities. ''The mood of the general council
today was clearly one of considerable concern,'' he said.
''They were very doubtful whether the proposals suggested in the
scheme would meet these two key principles of gender equality and
proportionality and were unable to endorse the suggested proposition as
it currently stands.''
However, Mr Robertson said: ''This figure was not plucked out of thin
air and was chosen after a careful balance of all the issues. We firmly
believe this parliament can be proportional and can deliver equal
representation between men and women.''
He said that two political leaders representing the bulk of Scottish
MPs and a majority of the Scottish population had produced a
thought-through proposed size for the Scottish parliament. ''It will not
allow the domination of the parliament by any geographical area or any
party and is right for Scotland. The Labour Party in particular has put
the interests of Scotland ahead of its own electoral advantage in this
historic recommended agreement.''
Mr Robertson said he would be seeking an urgent meeting with
representatives of the STUC to explain how and why the agreement had
been reached and he remained confident that once the arguments were put
the STUC would accept the proposals.
He added: ''Jim Wallace and I are firm in recommending this system to
the Scottish people. I am confident that once they receive this
explanation, the STUC will not allow the convention to break up over a
disagreement on numbers.''
The Tories and the Scottish National Party were quick to seize on the
STUC's criticism of the plans, writes William Tinning.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said it had sunk Mr Robertson's
''flagship'' policy.
Mr Forsyth said: ''Yesterday Tony Blair pulled the rug from under
George Robertson's education policy. Today the STUC has sunk his
flagship policy on a Scottish parliament. This is the price that
political parties pay when they abandon principles for opportunism.''
Since the original Labour-Lib Dem deal was announced, the Tories have
singled out the proportional representation element for particular
attack, claiming it would result in a ''jobs for the boys'' body. manned
by party hacks.
The Scottish National Party said that the STUC's statement showed how
far Labour leader Tony Blair had watered down his party's devolution
policy.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said ''The simple fact is that Labour cannot
be trusted on Scotland's constitution.''
He argued that Mr Christie's ''bitter disappointment'' with the
Convention proposals reflected its total inadequacy to meet Scotland's
needs.
The SNP leader added: ''The more devolution detail we get, the clearer
it becomes just how puny the proposals are. Scotland needs a powerhouse
independent Parliament, not a puppet parliament on a Westminster
string.''
However, the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the objective of the
agreement had always been to obtain concensus. The party remained
optimistic that this could still be achieved.
Canon Kenyon Wright, a leading figure with the Scottish Constitutional
Convention since it was formed, said it was an ''obvious setback,'' but
he did not believe any members would turn their backs on its work.
Canon Wright, chairman of the Convention's executive committee, said
he understood the reasons behind the STUC pressure for the higher number
of MPs in the convention. He believed the STUC wanted a sufficient
number of members to ensure proportionality and a gender balance.
He said: ''I think that we can convince the STUC that the figure
proposed of 129, as agreed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, will
give them what they in fact want.
''I don't think that, important though this is, that it is a life or
death matter for the Convention. We will find a way through this. We
have to, and in doing so we will keep to the timetable.''
