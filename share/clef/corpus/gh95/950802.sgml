INSURERS yesterday warned dishonest holidaymakers that they face a
crackdown on fraudulent claims which are costing the industry about #50m
a year.
The Association of British Insurers said that potential fraudsters
would be well advised to think again about looking to travel insurers to
subsidise their summer breaks.
As well as scrutinising travel claims the association said that it had
also developed systems for spotting insurance frauds.
As the scale of the fraud was made public -- #49,670,000 according to
latest figures -- it was revealed that it had been matched by the
audacity of some of the fraudulent claims.
In one case, said Ms Linda Hamilton, ABI's manager in Scotland, an
Ayrshire businessman claimed to have lost a suitcase every time he flew
abroad. In two years he claimed to have lost 36 suits, 57 pairs of
trousers, 86 shirts, 10 leather jackets, and seven pairs of binoculars.
However, the businessman ''tried it on too many times'' and ended up
being given a hefty fine.
Then there was the ''amazing story'' of the Scotswoman who lost her
fur coat in Tenerife. ''She took it because she'd heard there was snow
on one of the mountains. But she had no receipt and she did not get her
payout. Some people must think we came up the Clyde in a banana boat.''
Ms Hamilton said the crackdown would be backed up by initiatives such
as the Claims Underwriting Exchange, a national database which will
enable claims on more than one policy to be detected, and the newly
formed Crime and Fraud Prevention Bureau. Both highlighted the
industry's commitment to protecting honest policy holders.
She said: ''The insurance industry is determined to crack down on all
types of fradulent insurance claims. We have to safeguard the interests
of the great majority of policy holders who otherwise have to pay more
for their insurance.
''Fraudsters rip off the honest policy holder so we are calling for
full public backing to try to eliminate the holiday insurance frauds.
Gone are the days when it was thought fair game to cheat and lie. Fraud
is a crime and the insurance industry will encourage prosecutions.''
Other cases of fraud highlighted by the ABI included a Glasgow man
travelling to Egypt who allegedly suffered a stomach illness on his
arrival and had to be treated in a private clinic.
He submitted a claim for #1200 for medical expenses but his insurer
became suspicious when a similar claim was received from another clinic.
On investigation it was found to be the same policy holder and that
neither clinic existed.
Ms Hamilton said: ''He like other people felt that his claim was not
going to be investigated. In the past many were not, but this is not the
case now.''
In another case, a Kent man submitted 20 claims for lost goods using
receipts faked on his home computer.
A London woman claimed for the loss of sight in one eye on five
separate occasions. Her claims ranged from allegedly being attacked in
the street in Iran, being a victim of a hit and run accident, falling
off a chair, and colliding with a swimmer.
Ms Hamilton said the ABI was well aware of common holiday insurance
frauds. These included:
* Inventing or doctoring original receipts for items lost or stolen.
* Reporting fictitious thefts to police at the resort.
* Claiming from more than one policy -- for example, stolen
possessions claimed under both the travel insurance and home contents
policy.
She added: ''It's not worth it. If you get found out you won't get
paid, you might not get travel insurance again, and you could be fined
or even jailed.''

THERE was one ray of sunlight yesterday for George Fulston when
Falkirk District Council gave the go-ahead for his club's new stadium. A
new 15,000 all-seater ground just outside the town is planned.
The #5.5m development includes an all-weather sports pitch, training
pitch, six-a-side pitches, and parking for 1600 cars and 120 coaches.
The council's development services committee yesterday passed the
plans for the stadium at Westfield Farm between Falkirk and Grangemouth.
Because the proposed stadium is on a greenfield site, however, the
application must now go to the Scottish Secretary for final approval. No
hitches are expected.

SCOTTISH Office new boy Michael Forsyth, sweating blood to win hearts
and minds as a listening Secretary of State, will shortly be able to get
even closer to the hoi polloi.
For word has leaked from the asbestos-free bunker soon to be the new
Scottish Office in Leith's restaurant heartland that barely one in three
of the 1500 civil servants who will mob the tea trolleys there is
interested in taking the plunge in their very own swimming pool -- built
with #600,000 of our money.
This reluctance to take a dip between the emptying of the in and the
filling of the out trays may not be unconnected with the demand for #75
a year for the privilege. Now, even before the pool opens in October,
Scottish Office administrators are casting around for customers to
defray the running costs -- so far an offical secret wrapped in damp
towels.
But the Diary can reveal that pensioners and community groups are
being discreetly invited to swim-along-a-Mike, the listening, stay-cool
Scottish Secretary. An approach, it is rumoured, has also been made to
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, offering free facilities to perfect his
backstroke.
Staying silent
WHILE the SOS is in listening mode in Leith, across the firth at
Maritime Headquarters, Pitreavie Castle, Fosni is not talking. Fosni,
known to his intimates as Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland, is
apparently hoping to hide from the Russians that which they almost
certainly already know -- namely the switch over of submarine propellors
when ships are in for refit at the Rosyth naval base.
This sneakly process, done to fool our old Cold War protagonist as to
the sonar fingerprint of a given ship's screws, has to be niftily done
during a mere 40-minute window that opens just once a month when a
Russian surveillance satellite up there over the Forth bridges suffers a
blackout.
Two Swiftsure class nuclear-powered attack submarines, Sovereign and
Superb, are currently being fiddled with. But whose propellors are
where? Requests for clarification have been met, on the instructions of
Fosni, with a broadside of silence.
Last straw
CULTURALLY braced for the star burst of art that will yet again
transform their lives, Edinburgh's citizens none the less speak of
wormwood and gall. For just as the world enters stage left to savour the
old-world charm of the Athens of the North one of the city's most
magnificent vistas has been ravished.
Traffic lights have gone up in George Street at its junction with
Castle Street and the striking westward view to the domed architectural
masterpiece of St George's Church at the West End of the city is now
devastated.
The Rev Dr Thomas Chalmers, first moderator of the Free Kirk and for
his magnificence set on a red granite pedestal at the confluence of the
two roads in 1878, now suffers stop-go lights flashing around his
dignity.
In a city that stands to have its principal piece of statuary, the
Scott Monument, pitched at the open market for a mere quid a traffic
light at the feet of the good Dr, a moral philosopher, could be the last
straw needed to make Edinburgh folk recognise Glasgow for what it truly
is . . . the City of Culture.
Indelible tattoo
GOOD news now for the teeming hordes of the cultured who travel 50
miles east each year for the Edinburgh Military Tattoo . . . a spectacle
that continues to defy armed forces cutbacks and the so-called peace
dividend. Notwithstanding the absence of the Camel Corps and elements of
Probyn's Light Horse from recent tattoos some things, it seems, are
forever.
For somewhat dazed-looking householders in the suburb of Colinton who
have the good fortune to live within earshot of the open-plan Redford
Barracks -- the architect's drawings for an Indian barracks and a cosier
model intended for the capital were inadvertently switched in the War
Office mail room -- report that the massed pipes and drums will this
year be giving big licks to Amazing Grace and Rowan Tree: just as they
did last year, the year before that, and so on back into pre-history.
Not a grace note left unplayed -- not a dry eye on the terracing.
Out of the window
BUT it is further round the city's peripherique, in the crooked-pinky
environs of Morningside, long celebrated by pantomime comedians as the
fur-coats-and-no-knickers suburb where sex is something that coal comes
in, that deafness is setting in.
Thanks to resurfacing work proceeding apace -- all six weeks of apace
-- on a taxi-way at Edinburgh Airport, conversation over the
pre-prandial dry sherry customary in Morningside is not currently a
runner.
The arts, books, politics, travel, and the pros and cons of Linksave
at Safeway . . . none can be discussed until the tar is all patted down
again and runway 2507 is back in use, 350 aircraft a day back on course.
Meanwhile, in double-glazed Cramond, where grants were disbursed with
maniacal largesse to bring hush when the airport's main runway was swung
through 180 degrees some years ago, all is silent . . . even with
windows open for the heatwave.
Police under fire
NO Diary coming from the capital is a fit document without mention of
the finest body of men that money can buy -- the boys in blue who fill
the ranks of Lothian and Borders Police. This time the story concerns
two officers on duty in Berwickshire with a radar gun, on the look out
for motorists demonstrating insufficient regard for the speed limit.
However, their fiendishly clever device, ignoring the odd tractor and
runaway combine harvester taking part in a Young Farmer's speed trial,
clocked instead a low-flying RAF jet fighter -- the kind that curdles
milk even before it is bottled and clips the hedgerows below five feet.
The radar gun jammed at a figure just in excess of 300 miles an hour.
Taxed with this damage to police property the RAF, the Diary hears,
informed the constabulary that they had had a narrow squeak. The Harrier
jet, reported Biggles's boys, had ''locked on'' to the radar gun and
triggered an automatic attack. Fortunately the aircraft was not armed.
RAF 10, Police 0, and a clear run for motorists in Berwickshire until
constabulary nerve is restored.

PETER Walton was a stalwart of Scotland's rugby World Cup squad. The
Northampton flanker played in only one game, yet ask anyone in the party
and they will tell you his contribution was immense, whether at training
or coaching kids in the townships or just generally uplifting morale.
At 26, Walton might be regarded as a typical example of the modern
international player. He was born in Northumberland, educated in
Scotland, married with no children, and prepared to move if his job --
he is a livestock auctioneer -- and his rugby career can be mutually
accommodated.
Indeed, as he told me yesterday, Walton intends returning to live and
work in his native county in a few months. And where will he play his
rugby? ''I would love to turn out for one of the Scottish Border clubs.
My international future has to be with Scotland -- I have six caps and I
would like a lot more. If anyone is interested, tell them to give me a
call.''
Walton has another problem shared with many current internationalists
. . . he is recovering from serious injury. His right knee has been
giving trouble for several years, the latest operation, to ''release the
knee cap'' means he is unlikely to be fit to resume until the tail end
of this year.
Like every other top player Peter has been reading about the vast sums
of money which are about to be offered to those willing to throw their
lot in with Kerry Packer, or maybe Rupert Murdoch, or even Mark
McCormack. He has seen signing-on sums of #170,000 mentioned, plus
#150,000 per season to join the Packer circus.
Is he to be one of the 900 players who are said to be required for the
global set-up? Does he even want to be? Walton is far from sure.
''Of course I would look at any contract which was offered to me --
none has been so far, by the way. And, yes, I would like more financial
security, greater monetary rewards for the commitment which is required
to participate in international rugby.
''I fully understand, and sympathise, with players coming to the end
of their careers and wishing to make a big final pay-off. But, quite
honestly, I am not sure if I want to be a professional rugby player. Who
would be paying me now if I could not play? There are an awful lot of
questions which need answered.''
Is his view shared by many of the Scotland squad? ''I believe the
majority would do so.''
That's interesting, is it not? We have had weeks of speculation, of
stories where ''a leading'' but always unnamed player is about to start
a breakaway, of rumoured massive defections, yet a player who is
prepared to speak on the record takes quite a different tack. In truth,
I suspect most players are as bemused as the general public.
Permit me to nail a few colours to the mast. I would abhor a sell-out
to Packer or any of the other vultures circulating around rugby fields
at the moment, because I believe it would be a disaster for the game --
and the players.
I believe the introduction of the huge sums of money would lead,
inevitably, to destruction of the ethos of rugby, that there would be a
considerable risk of corruption and an increase in drug-taking. Rugby
union is not football, nor tennis, nor cricket, nor golf -- sports where
it is perfectly possible to run a reasonably clean, though not, as we
have seen, lily-white, professional sport. Rugby union is a game of
aggressive physical contact which requires to be rigidly controlled.
It is a game where playing for one's country is far more important
than appearing for the club, the very reverse of soccer. It is a game of
proud traditions which simply cannot be maintained in the Packer set-up.
His organisation wishes to invent new clubs, named London or Paris or
East Scotland or some such concoction, to play for nothing more valuable
than money. What price a district-championship tie or a set of sevens
medals then? The Calcutta Cup, the Triple Crown, the Five Nations'
Championship would all be deposited in the dustbin of history. For what,
one wonders? Of course the game must change, the players must be
rewarded better than they are now. The International Board must be
reconstructed and be awarded some teeth; the Home Unions must reorganise
their structure so that they are able to provide the kind of
professional back-up which is required.
There must be the best medical advice available, a proper scheme of
compensation for injured players, a recognition that many will require
help with their careers. The existing authorities would also do well to
realise, as evidenced in the World Cup, that refereeing has not kept
pace with developments in the game -- they need help, too.
If anyone is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon, it is the game's
present administrators. They either put their house in order or become
homeless. That would be to let down all the Peter Waltons of rugby.

HEARTS yesterday hit back in what is becoming a bitter, public row
over the ''defection'' of Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies to Tynecastle as
successor to Tommy McLean, who was recently sacked by the Edinburgh
club.
Falkirk chairman George Fulston, who had offered Jefferies a
seven-year contract to stay at Brockville, thought he had succeeded. But
Jefferies, a former Hearts captain, did an about-turn and accepted a
similar deal to return to his favourite club.
Falkirk say they have a letter of intent from Jefferies that he was
staying put and Fulston said: ''I had it recorded with the Scottish
League that Hearts had only until 1 o'clock last Friday to approach Jim
Jefferies. My argument will be that after that they induced him to
leave.''
Yesterday, however, Hearts replied with an official statement: ''The
club is pleased that, after several days of difficult deliberations, Jim
Jefferies has decided to take up the position of manager of Heart of
Midlothian.
''Statements made by Falkirk FC chairman Mr George Fulston are,
however, disturbing in that they do not, in our opinion, represent the
facts.
''On July 26, Mr Fulston gave this club permission to speak to Jim
Jefferies. There were no conditions attached to this from our
standpoint. Suggestions that we have made unauthorised approaches to Jim
Jefferies are, therefore, factually incorrect. At all times, throughout
the process, we checked with the Scottish Football League to ensure that
our actions were procedurally correct.
''Heart of Midlothian FC are, and always have been, willing to agree
compensation with Falkirk FC. We shall continue to seek a resolution,
failing which we will ask for the matter to be determined by an
independent tribunal.
''The club has always enjoyed good relations with Falkirk FC and we
would prefer that this matter is resolved privately to allow continued
good relations.''
There were hints last night from sources within the Scottish League
that the authorities may well back Hearts on the matter, despite the
fact that Fulston is the League's vice-president, but any move to deny
adequate compensation will be vigorously opposed by the Falkirk
chairman.
Hearts chairman Chris Robinson has an unhappy knack of upsetting
people. As a successful businessman in the catering industry -- his
company, Wheatsheaf, leads the way in its field in Scotland -- Robinson
possesses considerable skills in commerce.
He is not the first to discover that attributes which strike the
correct note in the high street, may not be totally applicable in the
quirky world of football. His first year in control at Hearts has seen
him fall foul of a clutch of people from Wallace Mercer down, but in the
last 12 days there has been a prodigous fall-out rate.
It was at 2pm on Friday, July 21, that Tommy McLean's association with
the club ended. Yet last July, the same two men appeared together in the
stadium's Premier Suite, both happy with life and with each other.
For the manager's part, Robinson's overtures offered the chance to
work at a big club, with potential to challenge the best. The chairman
was recruiting the only name on his list. He was entitled to assume this
was the manager who would induce full houses and create the revenue to
reinvest. Now, one year down the line, Tommy McLean has served a writ on
Hearts.
The differences between the men revolve around money. McLean asserted
several times publicly that the funds he was promised were not
forthcoming. The Hearts board insist that he was given #1.6m to
reconstruct the team.
After a decade of operating within a stringent budget at Fir Park, it
is reasonable to assume that McLean would have no complaint about the
fiscal restrictions, unless he was promised otherwise. However, the
failure to deliver was not furtive or deliberate, it was simply the
result of last season's share issue, which raised a net figure of only
#180,000.
McLean grew unhappier by the month, culminating in his sacking which
in turn began a process that has elevated Hearts' profile for all the
wrong reasons.
Robinson turned his attention to Jefferies. But, in a similar way that
skirmishes over the year with Sandy Clark, Hugh McCann, Charles Burnett,
Gary Hay, Mercer, and McLean, had ended in acrimony, the approach to
Falkirk chairman Fulston ended in an untidy and inconclusive manner.
Others over the year have been ostracised. Robinson swore never to
talk to top Scottish agent Bill McMurdo although last week he
successfully negotiated a new contract with John Robertson's
representative.
A number of Hearts' corporate customers have withdrawn advertising for
the coming season and reduced their level of spending, largely in
response to the departure of commercial manager Burnett. The last time
Mercer and his wife Anne visited a match, both were ignored in the board
room by the chairman.
It is felt that Robinson, in trying to follow the larger-than-life
Mercer, has created a deal of animosity. The reality may now be that
Robinson has few friends around him to assist with the difficult,
sensitive problems that football has thrust at him.
Straight talking and a recognition of everyone's place in the grand
scheme are hallmarks of the Heart of Midlothian tradition. Sadly, this
club's heritage of fair play has been blemished. In the meantime,
interested investor Jim Glass spectates speechless as writs fly like
paper aeroplanes in the school playground.

A LEADING agent yesterday ridiculed the lucrative contracts that have
been offered to England's top players by the Kerry Packer-backed World
Rugby Corporation.
Mike Burton, the former British Lions prop who represents some of the
country's elite players, believes the Packer offer will help the Rugby
Football Union prevent a mass exodus to the professional WRC.
''What tickled me about it was that the contracts say that on November
22 you get 10%, and if the thing takes off, you will get the rest of the
money in March. I think that plays into the hands of the Rugby Union,''
Burton told BBC Radio 5 Live.
''All they have to do is to give the players something at the end of
this month and say: 'This is the deal, these are the contracts,' and
nobody will go.
''That is the truth of the situation. From a purely commercial point
of view this Packer contract is a weak one.
''The best players will play at Twickenham, Murrayfield, and Cardiff
Arms Park, and the circus will be doomed to soccer grounds around the
country.
''They will have difficulty getting support, even though they have
millions of Packer money behind them.''
England's World Cup squad are currently negotiating with RFU officials
about future earnings.
In London last week senior players met Malcolm Phillips, chairman of
the recently formed committee designed to increase players' off-field
income.
RFU officials have been eager, in the two weeks since the WRC
enterprise became public, to pour scorn on the likelihood of it taking
off. Their belief is that players would be far more secure with the
guaranteed income from Twickenham than the promise of Aussie dollars.
WRC are reportedly offering signing-on fees ranging from #48,000 to
#176,500, with three-year contracts of #100,000 to #143,000 a year for
international players. They intend to sign 900 players for a world
series of more than 500 matches, split into three different areas and
starting next year.

THE world long jump record, established by Cuba's Ivan Pedroso in
Italy last Saturday, may not be ratified.
The International Amateur Athletic Federation -- which has the
responsibility of certifying records -- will examine video evidence
which appears to prove that the wind guage was shielded when he reached
8.96 metres in Sestriere, beating the existing mark by one centimetre.
Pedroso had four legal jumps, yet during the whole contest only one
other athlete was credited with a wind reading inside the permitted
limit of two metres per second.
The reading during the 100m, immediately before Pedroso's record, was
4.4mps, and the American jumper, Kareem Streete Thompson, reached 8.20m
just after with the guage again showing 4.4 against. Yet Pedroso's
record reading was 1.2mps.
Istvan Gyulai, the secretary of the IAAF, said following a council
meeting yesterday: ''We want all our records to be watertight.''
An amateur video shows a figure standing tight against the wind guage.
The wind guage official complained, but to no avail.
Italian officials were censured for conspiring to have Giovanni
Evangelisti's long jump given favourable measuring treatment at the 1987
world championships, and he was removed from the bronze medal spot.
IAAF president Primo Nebiolo, one of world sport's most powerful
figures, was cleared of any implication, but some mud stuck.
The controversy haunted him yesterday when billboards adverstising the
sponsoring newspaper, the respected Gotheborg Posten, proclaimed: ''Ak
hem, Nebiolo.'' Nebiolo, go home.
The Italian had been interviewed on TV about corruption and his
autocratic management style by Britt-Maria Matteson. ''Stop,'' yelled
Nebiolo's aide Giaccomo Mazzochi, halting the proceedings after just
eight minutes.
Matteson said: ''I've worked for 23 years as a foreign correspondent,
interviewed dictators and other nuts, but I've never met anyone who
behaves like Nebiolo.''
* SALLY Gunnell last night confirmed she will miss the World
Championships in Gothenburg altogether. She had previously abandoned her
defence of the 400m hurdles title because of Achilles and heel injuries.
Yvonne Murray is a leading contender to replace her as women's team
captain.

Everton 2, Celtic 2
CELTIC gave their best pre-season performance so far with a
second-half comeback at Goodison Park last night.
For more than an hour it looked as if the trials and tribulations
which have followed Celtic in their earlier matches were to continue on
Merseyside.
Around 8000 fans had travelled to swell the crowd at the Neville
Southall Testimonial match and they seemed destined to suffer yet again.
First-half goals from Anders Limpar and Duncan Ferguson had Everton
ahead at the interval.
Then John Collins, captain for the night, struck twice in the second
period to restore Celtic's reputation on Merseyside.
He scored with a penalty in 65 minutes then snatched another three
minutes later after Celtic's best move of the night.
If anyone received a bonus from the match it was Scotland manager
Craig Brown, who is desperately trying to assemble a squad for the
European Championship game against Greece at Hampden later this month.
For Everton, Ferguson scored a glorious goal and caused problems to
the Celtic defence.
This was Ferguson at his devastating, buccaneering best, a sight Brown
had wanted to see before naming him in the squad when it is announced
next week.
And Collins was at his finest, running the midfield, scoring two
goals, and showing vision throughout a match which always rose above the
level of a friendly.
This was a true test for both teams and manager Tommy Burns must be
happy that the progress he has been searching for looks to have arrived,
as he predicted.
Everton were unable to play their new #5m Russian star Andrei
Kanchelskis who has joined up at Goodison from Manchester United.
His work permit had failed to arrive in time and, instead, the fans
were left to salute him as he took the pitch before the match kicked
off.
Predictably, the Celtic fans roared their insults towards Ferguson --
but it was clear the former Rangers striker was ready to thrive on their
hostility.
He gave a sign of that after only four minutes when he collected a
pass from Vinny Samways then pushed the ball forward into the penalty
box to former Ibrox striker Paul Rideout, who thundered a shot against
the underside of the bar.
Three minutes later, a sweeping move from Everton again exposed the
Celtic defence. This time Limpar shot low but Pat Bonner saved with his
legs.
It was 12 minutes before the Scottish Cup winners had any kind of
chance but Pierre van Hooydonk's shot was blocked by a defender and went
out for a corner.
In 30 minutes van Hooydonk was warned by the referee for dissent. The
Dutchman complained bitterly that he had been held by David Unsworth.
Eventually, the referee stopped the game, spoke to the Celtic skipper,
then warned the striker that he would not accept a repeat performance.
A minute later Celtic went a goal behind. Samways made ground on the
right, finding space available in front of him. He tried a shot from
more than 20 yards which went past Bonner, struck a post, and flew back
out.
Before the Celtic defence could recover Limpar pounced to send a
vicious shot beyond Bonner and into the net.
0 Then, after 38 minutes Ferguson left Peter Grant for dead and
started a crossfield move which culminated in the striker trying a
spectacular overhead kick which went high.
A minute later Ferguson scored the goal he wanted. Andy Hinchcliffe
took a corner on the right and Ferguson was at the far post to head the
ball into the net.
At the start of the second half the Parkhead men looked more
purposeful and Southall was forced to make a marvellous save, pushing a
drive from van Hooydonk over the bar. He followed that with a diving
stop from a Grant shot.
But in 65 mintes the game started to swing Celtic's way. Tosh McKinlay
made a run down the left and into the box where the Everton sub, Grant,
brought him down. Southall's goalkeeping magic was not enough to stop
Collins scoring from the resultant penalty.
Within three minutes the same player equalised when the Parkhead men
had their best passing movement of the night. Donnelly sent the ball to
van Hooydonk and the Dutchman pushed a pass to Collins, who rifled a
shot into the net.
Burns said: ''At one stage it looked as if we were going to be turned
over -- but, by the end, we could have won the game.
''John Collins was superb. Tonight he proved that he is one of the
best midfield players in Britain.''
EVERTON -- Southall, Holmes, Hinchcliffe, Unsworth, Short, Parkinson,
Samways, Rideout, Ferguson, Horne, Limpar. Subs -- Amokachi, Kearton,
Grant, Ebbrell.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Boyd, McKinlay, McNally, Mowbray, Grant, O'Donnell,
Vata, van Hooydonk, Walker, Collins. Subs -- Falconer, Marshall,
Donnelly, McLaughlin, Mackay, Gray.
Referee -- K Cooper (England).

SCOTLAND internationalist Rob Wainwright is to return home early from
South Africa for an operation on a tendon in his leg.
The 30-year-old flanker, tipped as Gavin Hastings' successor as
Scottish captain, took unpaid leave from the army to play for Natal in
the Currie Cup but has not played because of the long-standing injury.
He decided to return home to be sure of being fit for the Scots' Test at
home to Western Samoa in November.

HOW much would you expect to pay for the best seats in the house
during a New York Knicks basketball game at Madison Square Garden? One
hundred dollars might seem like a lot of money. Until recently, however,
those requiring court-side VIP seats had to hand over five times that
much for each and every game. Now, they probably think they had a
bargain.
The Knicks' management recently announced that the cost of those prime
seats will be increased to a cool $1000. Someone like award-winning
movie director and rabid Knicks fan, Spike Lee, will now have to hand
over $43,000 simply to watch one year's worth of matches.
''I'd better make another hit movie now, so I can afford this,'' Lee
grumbled.
These high-priced tickets mean that watching the Knicks is now the
most costly spectator occupation in all of sport.
The New Jersey Nets appear to have taken an alternative standpoint to
that of their New York neighbours. Granted, the Nets have hardly met
with the success of the Knicks in recent times. Even so, the latter
should possibly take a leaf from their book.
The Nets have recently made radical changes to their team roster, a
move that has been met with much dissent among their fans. The team's
management responded by announcing that if their 4300 season-ticket
holders were not satisfied with the changes after two weeks of their
pre-season training camp, they would be issued a full refund.
If all those getting their money back were to pool their resources,
one of them might be able to get good seats at a Knicks game.
* RICHARD Sandomir is a TV sports critic for the USA's most revered
newspaper, the New York Times. Sandomir moved into another medium on
July 16 when he took a turn hosting cable TV's ''NewSport Talk''.
Fittingly, he later critiqued his own performance, although somewhat
more scathingly than one might have expected.
''It's bad enough when producers think that some of the experienced
people they hire are talented,'' wrote Sandomir. ''But to let a neophyte
pretend to be a professional anchor was arrogant. Or pitiful.''
Of course, Sandomir did intimate that he was blameless.
* THE quotable quotes have been flying in American sport in recent
times, most probably a reflection of the turmoil in which many US sports
find themselves.
American football, inevitably, is uppermost in many minds, not least
because of the high-profile murder trial of O J Simpson. Just a couple
of weeks ago, a bust of Simpson was stolen from the USFL Hall of Fame.
Despite a flurry of police activity there were no clues as to the
perpetrator.
The list of suspects was narrowed by one observer, though. ''I guess O
J didn't do it,'' he observed.
Boxing, too, has been rife with commentary following the return to the
ring of former champion Mike Tyson, now freed from prison following a
rape conviction. Tyson is scheduled to fight his second bout in early
November, the same night that Riddick Bowe and heavyweight champion
Evander Holyfield will be trading blows.
Rock Newman, promoter of the Bowe-Holyfield bout, is chagrined at the
Tyson camp's attempt to grab the TV ratings. He said: ''They are
attempting to serve the people dog biscuits. We are serving filet
mignon.''
And in the much-maligned sport of baseball, John Adams, a legendary
fan of the Cleveland Indians, renowned for their losing streaks, cannot
believe their current run of success.
''Sometimes I sit here in disbelief,'' he said, ''and wonder who is
wearing those Cleveland Indians uniforms.''
* ROLLER Hockey is hardly the most popular sport in the USA, but its
fans are enthusiastic to say the least. The Philadelphia Bulldogs are
owned by actor Tony Danza, best known for his role in the TV sitcom
Taxi.
In a bid to boost ticket sales, Danza and the Bulldogs' management
announced that anyone bringing a dog to their July 31 clash with the
Buffalo Stampede would be given free admission. And, yes, the dog would
also get in free.
Owners and dogs were seated in the section called ''The Dog Pound'',
and general manager John Page, explained: ''Instead of TV time-outs, we
had wee-wee time-outs.''
* SCOTT Pruett is an IndyCar driver who is sponsored by tyre company,
Firestone. He recently commented: ''It's been a very good year.''
Then, mindful of his allegiance, he corrected himself. ''Excuse me,
it's been a very fine year . . .''

JOE Sequeiri, manager of WBO welterweight title challenger Luvuyo
Kakaza, has accused champion Eamonn Loughran of head-butting his way to
glory -- and says he would prefer to see his fighter wearing a gridiron
helmet in Belfast on Saturday night.
Kakaza revealed his concerns over Loughran's last two bouts ending on
head clashes during a pre-fight news conference in Northern Ireland
yesterday.
And Sequeiri said: ''If I had my way, Luvuyo would go in with a helmet
on -- just like the American footballers -- against Loughran, who only
seems to win his fights with the head.
''I don't know where Loughran gets his reputation of being a hard
puncher, because he only beats people with head-butts. The only thing
Luvuya is concerned about is Loughran's head because it's his best punch
-- he's like a billy-goat.''
The 30-year-old challenger was in confident mood yesterday, despite
this being his first journey out of his native South Africa in 45 bouts.
Kakaza said: ''I'm very pleased to be in Belfast and I believe I will
be too strong for Eamonn. I am concerned about the way he uses his head,
and his low blows, but I have prepared for that.''
In the supporting bill, Sheffield's Paul 'Silky' Jones makes the first
defence of his WBO Continental light-middleweight title against Ghana's
Danny Juma, who fights out of Belfast.
Meanwhile, Oliver McCall has threatened to make Frank Bruno pay for
what happened to the American's close friend Gerald McClellan in London
five months ago.
McClellan was seriously injured in his world-title fight against Nigel
Benn -- and the fact Benn and Bruno are big pals is enough to give the
WBC heavyweight champion the scent of revenge.
McCall, who makes his second defence of the title against Bruno at
Wembley Stadium on September 2, warned: ''It's payback time.''
The man who wrenched away the WBC crown from Lennox Lewis last
September is adamant that French referee Alfred Azaro should have
stopped the fight in the first round when Benn was knocked through the
ropes.
McCall, 30, said: ''This is a very special fight for me. It's a fight
for vengeance for my friend Gerald McClellan.
''Unfortunately, Gerald is blind -- a vegetable. But he'll be rooting
me on in spirit and Bruno will have to pay.
''Gerald was unjustly treated. From looking at the video, the fight
should not have gone that far. It should have been over in the first
round as Benn was knocked out, and if it had, then Gerald would not be a
vegetable now.''
Of Bruno, he said: ''I will take him out and try to do what he did to
my friend. It's as simple as that -- that's how I feel.''
McCall's outburst seems sure to prompt the British Boxing Board of
Control into asking a few questions -- and they already have to look
into Chris Eubank's broadside at Steve Collins last weekend.

THE Perth Open, Scotland's event on the Friends Provident British
Grand Slam series, will once again be the richest competition on the
tour with some #1000 more up for grabs than at any of the other four
events.
The #6350 prize fund, an increase from last year, has attracted
Britain's top players to Perth from September 1 to 3, including former
European champion and defending champion Darren Hall and last year's
women's singles winner Jo Muggeridge.
The event, sponsored by Perth and Kinross Recreational Facilities,
will pay out #700 for the men's singles champion and #500 for the
women's singles victor.

FOR the third successive day, light winds plagued Tennents West
Highland Yachting week and the proposed 23-mile passage race from Oban
to Tobermory was shortened to allow the majority of the 173-boat fleet
to finish.
Even so, there were plenty who found the pace too slow, opting to
retire and complete the passage under engine. The finish-line was laid
some three miles north-west of Lochaline.
While earlier starters enjoyed a good sail, the faster Class 1 boats,
which started last, suffered a general recall after half-a-dozen boats
went over the start-line. The extra 10 minutes' wait to restart left
them chasing a fading breeze.
For that class, the 6pm time-limit proved an impossible target and no
boats finished -- a frustrating waste of a day.
Naval architect Chris Morrison steered the substantial Moody 38,
Quaila, to a convincing win on corrected time in Class 2, while both
William Marshall on Crunluath, a veteran Honeybee in Class 8, and Frazer
and John Hunt in their Sonata, Diana, won for the second time this week.
The 1994 overall regatta winner, Roger Clegg, helming his Evergreen
[3/4]-tonner Mezzanine of Down, triumphed in Class 7 and Douglas Watson
steered his family Sigma 33, Rupert, to a win of just more than a
minute. Results:
Race Three (Oban to Tobermory): Class 1 -- No finishers.
Class 2 -- 1, Quaila (C Morrison) 2hr 20min 16sec; 2, Chameleon (J
MacTaggart) 2-23-51; 3, State O'Chassis (D R Henniker-Major) 2-24-20.
Sigma 33 -- 1, Rupert (D Watson) 2-13-50; 2, Odyssey (S Hood) 2-15-17;
3, White Lightning (D Jackson) 2-17-05.
Class 4 -- 1, Cavalier (W Cochrane) 2-21-33; 2, Revolver (R Perry)
2-22-12; 3, Chansa (M Loose) 2-29-48.
Class 5 -- Diana (J &amp; S Hunt) 2-20-14; 2, Carna (A Cousin) 2-22-38; 3,
Cynara (C Porteous) 2-27-08.
Class 6 -- 1, Rowan (A Ure) 2-25-13; 2, Ear Roller (A Lysser) 2-30-17;
3, Phendra (F Campbell) 2-31-38.
Class 7 -- 1, Mezzanine of Down (R Clegg) 3-01-57; 2, Silver Dollar (P
Whalley) 3-03-54; 3, Eureka (C Friar) 3-06-53.
Class 8 -- 1, Crunluath (W Marshall) 2-57-24; 2, Mist of Malin (K
Beaumont) 3-07-45; 3, Riever of Lorne (A Armstrong) 3-15-56.
* THE USA again increased their lead in the Admiral's Cup yesterday --
helped by a blunder by closest rivals Italy, who misjudged their arrival
and turned up five minutes after the starting gun had been fired.
The Americans extended their lead to 20 points with high finishes in
every race.
Britain managed an improved performance with second places for Robin
Aisher, at the helm of big-boat entry Group 4 Seahorse, and Mike
Golding, skipper of the British small boat, Group 4 Mumm.

THEY helped a Francophile World War II veteran track down vintage
nylons for an old flame; and through them, J R Hartley landed his
fly-fishing book. But if Steve Backley can spear a javelin medal at the
World Championships, then good old Yellow Pages can take the credit for
a factual achievement, rather than a fictional one.
Backley, double European and Commonwealth champion, but without a
world medal in three attempts, has another chance a week on Sunday in
Gothenburg.
He has buried his recurring fitness worries thanks to a South African
sports-injury guru to whose door the world is beating an increasingly
well-defined path.
Dr Ron Holder is a kinesiologist and biomechanical expert whose other
successes include Backley's great rival world record-holder Jan Zelezny,
400m runner Roger Black, and track runner Zola Budd. But of greatest
impact in his native country is that he is the man who defused the
explosive New Zealand winger, Johan Lomu.
Balance is the science in which Holder specialises, and he ventured
that left winger Lomu was vulnerable if he could be hit on the right,
rather than from the other side.
The Springbok defenders in the World Cup final did just that, and
Holder is credited with a share of their triumph.
Zelezny could barely walk, never mind hurl a javelin, when he first
saw Holder. Within a week he was walking normally; in two he was
throwing again; and in less than four the world record was his.
Earlier this year, Backley, plagued by recurring injuries which had
baffled every specialist, and fearing his career might be over, sought
Holder's help.
He detected a serious mal-alignment. Bare-footed, Backley demonstrated
this by stretching alternately as far as possible down each leg. One
hand reached some four inches further down one leg than he could manage
with the other.
''Holder treated this by making up special insoles for me,'' explained
Backley. ''He does it very precisely, building the insoles to the exact
thickness using pages torn from the Yellow Pages directory. Then he
binds the pages with ordinary masking tape.
''It is three times as thick as a page, so he takes out three pages.
Then I wear the inserts when I throw. You think I am kidding, don't
you?''
When I expressed scepticism, he pulled on his shoes, with the insoles,
and reached down both legs in turn. His hands touched the identical spot
on the side of each calf. ''My body is perfectly balanced as a result.
I've got three different bits of padding on the insoles, each correcting
various problems. The theory is that if the centre of gravity is down
the centre of your body, you are not so susceptible to injury.''
But Holder does not minister only to sporting needs. ''One elderly
lady whom he treated for arthritis left him a van Gogh in her will,''
added Backley.

EOIN Jess's injury jinx has struck again to undermine his bid to
regain his place as one of Scotland's top players.
A series of blows caused the striker to lose his place with Aberdeen
and Scotland last season as he delivered just two goals, and when the
Dons left yesterday for their tour of England, Jess was forced to remain
at Pittodrie for treatment to an Achilles tendon injury which could cost
him a place in the firing line for the new season.
The injury happened in the goalless draw at Arbroath on Monday night
and is the latest setback for manager Roy Aitken, who already has had to
rule out Brian Irvine, Brian Grant, and goalkeeper Theo Snelders.
Aitken admitted: ''We will know the extent of the injury once it has
been fully examined and I'm hoping it isn't too serious and he will be
able to link up with us later in our tour.
'''Obviously, though, this has not been the best of starts for us, but
there are other players in the squad who will help us overcome these
difficulties.''
One of these players is undoubtedly Scott Booth, who took over from
Jess to play his first game since damaging his groin in Scotland's
European Championship tie against Russia last November.
Aberdeen play Billingham tonight in the first of their three tour
games.
* URUGUAYAN midfield player Juan Ferreri has walked out on Dundee
United, and now the Tayside club's South American connection could be
over for good.
The 25-year-old, who cost United #250,000 when Ivan Golac signed him
from Defensor in January, flew home yesterday after a meeting with
manager Billy Kirkwood.
The United manager admitted last night: ''We spoke at great length
about his position here and it was clear he was unhappy, because we
could not guarantee him first team football.
''The sad thing was that the player put a lot of effort into his
pre-season training, but it was clear his heart wasn't in it.
''He had been told there was a place open for him on our trip to
Finland last week if he showed an appetite, but we ended up taking Paul
Walker, one of our youngsters instead.''
In fact, Ferreri made just one appearance as a substitute as a United
first-team player, coming on for a brief appearance against Clyde in a
0-0 Scottish Cup draw at Tannadice on January 28.
Now, United will try to recoup at least some of the outlay on the
player.
Kirkwood added: ''We still hold his registration so he is putting
himself out of the game unless he can find another club for himself.
''We granted him time off before to look elsewhere and he wasn't
successful. Now we hope he does find something which will allow us to
recoup some of our cash.''
* THE job of captaining Dundee for the season could be up for grabs
when Dundee face Bolton in a pre-season clash at Dens Park tonight.
Manager Jim Duffy has made it clear he will want someone else in
charge on the park unless Slovakian defender Dusan Vrto signs a
long-term contract with the club for the new season.
So far the former Banik Ostrava man has only agreed to extend his stay
with Dundee on a month-to-month basis.
The Dens manager has given the skipper's job to Ray Farningham, George
Shaw, Gerry Britton, and Neil Duffy during their pre-season games.
Dundee could line up against the English Premiership newcomers with
two new faces in defence. Former Falkirk pair, Roddy Manley and Tommy
McQueen, have been training at Dens and have clearance to play.

RANGERS defender Gordan Petric, who will be a key player in the
defensive system which manager Walter Smith will use this season, has no
doubts as to the ultimate success of the formation.
''It is the way the game is played all over Europe,'' said Petric, who
made his debut during the Ibrox tournament after his #1.5m signing from
Dundee United.
''And it is a style of play which can help the team reach the
Champions' League and, hopefully, find success there.''
Petric will slot happily into his role in the three-at-the-back tactic
which is currently used by Scotland's international team and is now
being utilised by Smith, although he will miss the European Cup
preliminary-round tie against Anorthosis Famagusta at Ibrox next
Wednesday because of a ban he picked up with Dundee United last season,
as well as a domestic ban for the Coca-Cola Cup tie against Greenock
Morton a week on Saturday.
It is not a completely new development in the thinking of the Ibrox
manager. He has tried in the past to play this way but found it
difficult to get players to adapt.
Recently, Smith made the point that coaches don't have to tell good
players what to do, they simply put them into a playing context where
they will be happy.
And the Rangers defence will be settled and content as the season
unfolds.
Stephen Wright and David Robertson will be allowed to push forward in
the way they enjoy while Richard Gough, Alan McLaren, and Petric will
sit together in the centre.
The thought of this makes Petric happier than anyone.
He admitted: ''I grew up playing this way. It was the only way I knew
when I was with Partizan Belgrade. Now, I will get the opportunity to
play in a familiar style and that can only help me.
''I played in Europe many times with Partizan -- against Real
Sociedad, Inter Milan, Sporting Gijon, and other teams -- and this
manner of playing in defence is the one which is best.''
Petric and the new-look Rangers team will be seen in action again at
Broadwood tonight when they play Clyde as Smith continues his
preparations for next week's European Cup tie at Ibrox.
He will send a strong team, possibly including Paul Gascoigne, and
almost certainly putting Ally McCoist on view again.
McCoist is a fan of Petric and pointed out: ''When I played against
him I recognised the defensive qualities he possesses.
''Now, playing with him, I can see just how much ability he has. His
passing out of defence, and the way he can start attacks from deep
positions, is magnificent.''
Petric believes that his transfer to Rangers has put him back in the
big time.
He said: ''Partizan are a very big club then I was with Dundee United,
who are a much smaller club. Now, I am back with the best, because
everyone knows Rangers are the best in the country.
''At United there were good players, but a lot of young players. Now,
I find myself surrounded by internationalists. When you have that
setting then you can give your best.
As well as the Clyde match tonight Rangers will head for a challenge
against Dundee United, Petric's old team, at Tannadice on Friday.

WARWICKSHIRE stayed on course for a second successive treble by
reaching the NatWest Trophy semi-finals with a 116-run victory at Derby
yesterday.
Dermot Reeve's side dismissed Derbyshire for 174, having earlier made
290 for six in their 60 overs.
They managed to allay the threat of England hero Dominic Cork -- who
claimed a wicket with his second ball before his stint was curtailed due
to a knee injury.
Dougie Brown, Nick Knight, and Roger Twose all made half-centuries for
the visitors, and Allan Donald then took five for 41 and
man-of-the-match Tim Munton one for 13 off 12 straight overs as
Derbyshire never looked like threatening Warwickshire's total.
Warwickshire were denied a Grand Slam of the four domestic trophies
when they lost to Worcestershire in the NatWest final last September.
Yorkshire were the only side batting second to win, getting the better
of Lancashire in a thrilling encounter at Headingley only in the final
over.
Australian Michael Bevan kept his cool to hit the winning runs and
seal victory by two wickets after they had been set a modest target of
170.
But Yorkshire were on the ropes at 155 for eight. Bevan kept his cool
and notched the three runs needed off the final over to take his tally
to an unbeaten 60 off 126 deliveries.
Earlier, Lancashire had been skittled out for 169, with Mike Watkinson
top-scoring on 55.
Paceman Steve Watkin was Glamorgan's hero in a crushing 66-run win
over Middlesex at Cardiff -- but not before an evening thunderstorm had
interrupted their victory charge.
The former England bowler took four for 26, including a double-wicket
maiden, as the Welshmen rocked Middlesex after Mike Gatting's side
looked in control by reducing Glamorgan to 242 for nine.
Watkin was ably assisted by Hamesh Anthony, who also took four
wickets, and man-of-the-match Colin Metson, adding two fine catches to
the 20 he scored off just 17 balls in Glamorgan's innings.
Northamptonshire completed the semi-final line-up by taking advantage
of Gloucestershire's bad timing at Bristol. After being dismissed for
226, the visitors managed to stall Gloucestershire, with Dean Hodgson
managing just eight singles in 63 balls during a 21-over spell --
despite pleas from the pavilion to speed up. Quarter-final scores:
At Derby. Warwickshire 290-6 (N V Knight 71, D R Brown 58, R G Twose
51); Derbyshire 174 (K J Barnett 53; A A Donald 5-41). Warwickshire won
by 116 runs.
At Cardiff. Glamorgan 242-9 (S P James 56); Middlesex 176 (J D Carr
62; H A G Anthony 4-25, S L Watkin 4-26). Glamorgan won by 66 runs.
At Bristol. Northamptonshire 226 (R J Bailey 52; J Srinath 4-38);
Gloucestershire 203 (J P Taylor 4-34). Northamptonshire won by 23 runs.
At Headingley. Lancashire 169 (M Watkinson 55); Yorkshire 170-8 (M G
Bevan 60no). Yorkshire won by two wickets.

ST MIRREN yesterday signed Scotland youth cap Chris Pollok from
Rangers. The teenage defender is taking up a place at university and is
switching to part-time football.
Saints manager Jimmy Bone said: ''He is an outstanding prospect and is
only being allowed to leave Ibrox as he wants to be part-time to
concentrate on his studies.''
Saints midsummer capture Bobby Law, from Partick Thistle, will make
his home debut tonight against Celtic after a confidence boosting tour

BRIAN Barnes' new career in European seniors golf has come to a halt
-- just 48 hours after his play-off victory in the Senior British Open
at Royal Portrush on Sunday.
Barnes has been forced to pull out of the #70,000 Lawrence Batley
Seniors tournament, starting at Fixby, Huddersfield, today after
suffering an attack of phlebitis (swelling of veins) in his right leg.
A doctor ruled the 50-year-old former Ryder Cup star out of this
week's tournament and suggested he may have to undergo long-term
treatment, which may affect his plan to play in another four events in
his debut year on the PGA European Seniors Tour.
John Morgan, who won the event last year on the way to topping the
European Order of Merit, will make a confident defence after finishing
joint third behind Barnes at Portrush.
* DEFENDING champion David Jones came within a downswing of a breach
of the rules at the Glenmuir Club Professional Championship at West Hill
yesterday as the former tour player from Mount Ober managed a
long-awaited return to competitive action, writes Matthew Lindsay.
Jones realised an illegal fifteenth club was in his bag only as he
started the backswing on his opening tee-shot.
Unshaken, the veteran Irishman completed a one-over-par first round of
70 to trail new course record-holder Peter Lane (Stocks) by six strokes
on a day of low scoring.
David Scott, of Letham Grange, carded a three-under-par 66 despite a
recent lack of competition and Dalmahoy's Stuart Callan holed a 60-foot
bunker shot at the fifteenth en route to the same score. Leading scores:
64 -- P Lane (Stocks).
65 -- G Smith (Camberley Heath), N Job (Richmond).
66 -- D Scott (Letham Grange), S Callan (Dalmahoy), P Carman
(Huddersfield).
67 -- A MacKenzie (Calcot Park), C Hall (Rushcliffe), T Sheaff (Trent
Park), J Woof (Netherlands).
68 -- K Kelsall (Sweetwoods), K MacDonald (Goodwood), G Stubbington
(Corhampton), W Grant (West Berkshire), R Tinworth (Nizels), G Vickers
(Knaresborough), F Mann (Musselburgh), R Weir (Cowal), B Evans
(Portugal), J Harrison (Matfen Hall), J Hoskison (West Surrey), S
McKenna (Stocksfield), N Allen (Shirley Park).
Other Scottish scores included: 69 -- C Gillies (Falkirk), K Hutton
(Downfield). 70 -- G Law (Uphall), K Stables (Montrose), C Maltman
(Eyemouth). 72 -- A Marshall (Kingsknowe). 76 -- A McCloskey (Airdrie).
78 -- S Kerr (Renfrew), A Webster (Edzell).
* COLVILLE Park won the twelfth annual East Renfrewshire Boys' Team
trophy yesterday, lifting the Bonar Walker Trophy with a team score of
231.
Eastwood's three-man team shot 234, one ahead of third-placed Haggs
Castle. Colville Park's B team were fourth with a total of 237.

THE selectors have given a vote of confidence to the Scots who
retained the Triple Crown and then beat Denmark.
They have picked their strongest batting line-up for years to face
Ireland in the annual three-day clash in Dublin in a fortnight.
Uddingston's George Reifer, who missed the victory over the Danes,
returns in place of Stuart Kennedy. But the biggest boost is that
Aberdeenshire's Mike Smith is available.
There is a step-up to the senior twelfth-man slot for Glasgow Accies
youngster Dougie Lockhart, who guided the under-19s to third place in
the Youth World Cup in Holland.
Three other talented teenagers have earned places in the Scotland B
party to take on Durham at Stockton next week. Falkirk footballer John
Blain and Fife spinner Ross Mitchinson are in the XI, while Edinburgh
Accies batsman Stuart Moffat is twelfth man.
Ayrshire wicketkeeper David Haggo has shaken off the effects of a
fractured finger and will lead the side. Teams:
Scotland -- G Salmond (Arbroath), captain, A Davies (Grange), S
Gourlay (Freuchie), J Govan (Carlton), B Patterson (Ayr), I Philip
(Stenhousemuir),G Reifer (Uddingston), K Sheridan (Poloc), M Smith
(Aberdeenshire), K Thomson (Strathmore), G Williamson (Clydesdale).
Scotland B -- D Haggo (Ayrshire), captain, J Blain (Penicuik), D Cowan
(Freuchie), D Lockhart (Glasgow Accies), B Lockie (Carlton), N MacRae
(Aberdeenshire), G McGurk (Grange), R Mitchinson (Fife), B Robertson
(Forfarshire), A Storie (West of Scotland), A Tennant (Ayrshire).

DEPENDING on the point of view, the greatest point of controversy at
Southerness yesterday was either that as the heatwave continued, the
clubhouse bar ran out of ice or that David Robertson, found guilty of
cheating 10 years ago by the Royal and Ancient Club and both the club
and tournament professional organisations, again took part in the J&amp;B
Scottish Amateur championship.
Other than that, the projected match of the day, unlike many of its
predecessors, turned out to be just that. Barclay Howard, soon to be a
Walker Cup player at 42, beat Allan Thomson, a former champion, who is
37, by one hole, having lost the opening three holes, the first two to
birdie 3s.
Robertson celebrated, if that is the appropriate word, his return with
a first-round victory by 3 and 2 over Scott Gillespie, a two-handicapper
at Cambuslang.
Robertson, whose offence involved incorrect replacing of the ball for
more than one green during the final qualifying competition at Prince's
for the 1985 Open Championship, was punitively suspended and fined.
Surprisingly, he regained his amateur status as early as 1992 and having
played some Lothians events, the Scottish Golf Union lifted their ban.
Now 38, Robertson remarked after his first match since 1973 at
Carnoustie: ''I'm glad it's over, that's the worst of it. The next match
should be easier, although everyone's watching me. Was I hard done too?
The past is finished and I don't want to talk about it.'' In all the
circumstances, he played well.
On Monday, Robertson will have an operation to remove a trapped nerve
from his neck. His brisk, serviceable swing around that aldermanic girth
was thus so restricted that he used a No.2 iron from the tee -- no great
disadvantage in the east wind.
0 Since Robertson's only golf in the past month was two practice
rounds over the 6566-yard links, a score of four over par was quite
acceptable.
But Robertson was under no illusion of making further progress.
''After 14 or 15 holes my shoulder stiffens up,'' he admitted. Now he
will be expected to play two rounds a day and so, realistically, he
cannot continue much longer. ''But,'' Robertson said unrepentently, ''I
enjoyed myself.''
As if Thomson's start was not problem enough, he and Howard are
long-time friends. In some 30 bounce games and two county matches Howard
had never beaten Thomson. Had he not halved the short fourth from six
feet that would probably have been that.
Instead Howard, for whom Graham Rankin caddied, repaying Howard's
services to him on Monday, gradually reeled in Thomson to the bank like
a bravely struggling salmon. Thomson, less a competitor than a selector
these days, regained his lead at the tenth.
The last five holes, a stern test, decided the issue. A pitch to a
foot won the fourteenth in 3; Thomson struck his next tee shot into
whins and mis-hit his approach to the sixteenth to become two down.
Although Thomson's 2 at the seventeenth prolonged the contest, Howard's
chip and run to a foot at the last ended it.
Elsewhere, Alan Turnbull, Alan Reid and David Downie, the three other
seeds under fire, also won through.

SCOTTISH tennis has found a new star in Kyle Spencer, a 19-year-old
Californian student who this week qualified for the first leg of the
British Summer Satellite Circuit at Ilkley.
Glasgow-born Spencer has lived in America for 18 years but made his
first competitive appearance in Britain four weeks ago when he joined
the Reebok Tour in Felixstowe. Last week he represented West of Scotland
in the British Inter-County championships at Cambridge.
He said: ''Although I'd love to play in Scotland, I'm committed to the
Satellite Circuit at Southsea, Worthing, and Havant for the next three
weeks. Maybe next summer.''
Michele Mair failed to justify her seventh seeding in the $10,000
Women's Satellite tournament at Ilkley when she lost 6-2, 6-4 to Natalia
Egorova (Belarussia) in the first round.
Miles Maclagan scored a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Croation Igor Saric in
yesterday's first round of the $25,000 Men's Challenger event in
Istanbul and now meets sixth seed Lars Jonsson from Sweden, who beat
Britain's Danny Sapsford 6-4, 6-1.
* THERE was no brotherly love lost at the Bank of Scotland Scottish
hard-court championships at Dundee's Games Club yesterday when
15-year-old Gary Smith claimed the scalp of big brother Toby, 21, the
Scottish No.8, with a 7-6, 6-0 victory which earns him a place in the

SCOTLAND'S Graeme Obree last night failed in his bid to improve his
own world record in the final of the open 4000m pursuit at the British
Cycling Federation national track championships in Manchester.
But Obree easily retained his title when he caught gold-medal rival
Bryan Steel with three-and-a-half laps of the 16-lap race left.
Obree went on to clock 4min 26.501sec, six seconds outside the world
record he set in Norway two years ago and four seconds slower than his
qualifying ride for the national series.
''You really need to be under pressure to win a gold medal and the
record will come with it,'' he said later. ''Conditions were very hot
and heavy tonight.''
Victory ensured the Scot will represent Britain in the world
championships in Colombia in September when he will be aiming to regain
the title he won in Norway two years ago.

THIS year's event at Posnan in Poland has been devastated before it
starts with many competitors going down with severe cases of salmonella,
caused by food given to them at the athletes' catering facilities.
At least 65 cases have been reported among competitors. Many more
coaches and officials have been affected. Dr Bill Webb, of Australia,
one of the world governing body doctors, confirmed that about one in
nine competitors has gone down so far. Some nations are severely
affected.
In the British team, four cases have now been confirmed.
Chief coach Mark Banks said: ''Three years of hard work have been
ruined by egg mayonnaise made up from leftovers.''
Yesterday, after pressure from team managers, the opening heats of
men's eights were postponed.
Britain's team includes three competitors from George Watson's
College. Isabel Walker and Katrina Hastings feature in the women's four
which start their campaign today and are joined by Laura Fitzgibbon in
the women's eight who raced yesterday.
They lined up against an Australian crew with just seven rowers.
However, by covering the course, the Australians kept the right to
compete later in the week.

WHEN Laura Davies steps on to the first tee of the West course at
Dalmahoy tomorrow to begin her defence of the Payne and Gunter Scottish
Open championship, she will do so as the confirmed wonder of the women's
golfing world. The manner in which she retained her Irish Open title at
the weekend aptly confirms that assertion.
Briefly, her winning score of 267 not only beat the previous European
winning margin of 16 strokes by five but it bettered, also by five
strokes, the world record total for any women's professional tournament
which she shared with Scotland's Dale Reid and the Americans, Nancy
Lopez and Beth Daniel.
Little wonder that Davies has been installed as the evens favourite
for the Scottish championship. In gaining her fourth victory of this
year worldwide, and the thirty-seventh of her career, Davies took her
1995 earnings to date to #353,000 and her latest #15,000 prize took her
to second place within the same amount behind the US Open champion,
Sweden's Annika Sorenstam, on the American Express tour.
To continue, at the age of 31 and in her eleventh season as a
professional, to be the dominant player still after her phenomenal
performances of last year, is remarkable. In 1994 Davies had eight
victories -- three in the United States, two in Europe, and one each in
Asia, Japan, and Australia, the first player ever to have won on all
five of the women's tours in the same year.
Inevitably, attention is focused on Davies's considerable physical
stature, at 5ft 10ins and proportionately to match in bulk, an
intimidating sight for any rival at the remoter distance of strokeplay
or the proximity of matchplay. From above them, however, there usually
beams a cheerful, though slightly shy, smile, the outward expression of
a genuinely optimistic nature.
Indeed, two or three years ago Davies pre-empted the remark which Sam
Torrance last week disclosed as the analysis given to him by his wife,
Suzanne, to account for his rewarding form of the past month -- ''worry
is the interest on the inevitable'', meaning, presumably, to accept that
things will go wrong without suffering psychological meltdown.
Thus Europe's Solheim Cup team captain, Mickey Walker, says of Davies:
''It is her manner of achieving greatness which is so exceptional, her
sense of fun and enjoyment of the game. Laura is aware of her position
but unlike a lot of people in sport she doesn't abuse it. She does not
feel superhuman from all the adulation.''
That opinion is confirmed by Davies' reluctance to make speeches in
public, in which direction her stage fright once reached the point where
she said she would almost rather finish second than win and have to
endure the torment, for her, of having to make a few remarks, however
routine the content, at a prize-giving ceremony.
Of tournaments she says: ''They are all fun. Who comes out on top is
important, but there is always next week. Pressure? What pressure? How
much fun can you have?'' Davies' attitude is certainly far removed from
the real and earnest expressions which haunt so many golfers, amateur
and professional, these days.
Last summer, in fact, Davies observed: ''If I miss every cut between
now and the end of the year, I would be very disappointed, but I would
think -- great, six wins, five seconds, and a couple of thirds, life
can't be that bad.''
The financial rewards reaped by a player once somewhat unkindly
represented as ''The Colossus of Ottershaw'' are considerable enough to
allow her to ''shop till she drops''. The baubles include a BMW car of
an awe-inspiring cubic capacity and a new house in the Surrey
stockbroker belt. The bubble shows no sign of bursting.
However, Davies takes a prudent view of the future. She says: ''It is
a very fragile thing, golf, and every time you win it gets more
difficult because mentally you think it has to stop soon. But I always
said that when I was into my 30s I would play my best golf.'' How
accurate that forecast has turned out to be.

A RELIEVED Richard Hughes can partner Martara to victory in the Lyde
Green Nursery Handicap tonight at Kempton.
The Irishman has made a big impact since coming over to ride as stable
jockey to Mick Channon this year and has landed Group race wins on
Piccolo and Sergeyev.
But he put up 4lb overweight at 8st 13lb on Stewards' Cup winner
Shikari's Son at Goodwood on Saturday and is in danger of missing
further winning opportunities due to problems with his weight.
Hughes would certainly have been odds-against partnering Martara when
the entries were made for today's race as the colt was set to carry only
8st 3lb -- well below the 22-year-old's minimum.
So he will have been delighted that the weights went up at the
overnight stage, leaving Martara on a much more manageable 8st 13lb.
Martara would definitely have been a disappointing horse to miss out
on as he was a very comfortable winner in maiden company at Ayr last
month.
That was his first outing since April and he has plenty more
improvement to come, particularly now that he steps up to six furlongs
for the first time.
Each of his rivals has shown ability so he'll be a fair price too --
he looks the best bet of the day.
Though small fields are a feature of the afternoon's meetings at
Brighton and Newcastle, tricky races abound and finding winners looks
none too easy.
Best option at Newcastle could be Jalcanto in the Weatherbys
'Newcomers' Series Handicap.
The gelding developed into a useful hurdler in the winter but showed
he had lost none of his speed when runner-up at Redcar on his return to
the Flat last month.
He'll have come on a lot for that run and should maintain Mary
Reveley's position as leading trainer at the course.
Hever Golf Star is worth a chance in the closing Edburton Maiden
Handicap at Brighton.
Though unplaced in three outings to date, he has shown definite signs
of ability each time and is potentially thrown in at the weights against
modest opposition.

FRANKIE Dettori's visit to North Yorkshire yesterday cost punters a
packet as hotpot Crackernat failed to deliver at Catterick.
The champion had travelled north for just the one ride and backers
took the hint.
A string of four-figure bets -- totalling about #25,000 -- saw Luca
Cumani's colt backed down to 4-6 from an opening even money for the
Fraggles Conditions Stakes.
But the confidence misfired with fellow Newmarket raider Dankeston
easily putting him in his place.
Dettori had set out to make all the running but Crackernat began to
throw out distress signals two furlongs out.
At that point Dankeston struck for home and, with Crackernat sticking
his head in the air, strolled home by a comfortable one-and-threequarter
lengths.
Admirals Secret had shared the same horsebox with Dankeston and
emulated his travelling companion an hour later.
Under a tidy ride from Lee Newton, Admirals Secret justified 11-8
favouritism in the Dragon Troop Handicap, coming home two lengths clear
of Milngavie.
''He likes it here and they seem to have done an excellent job with
the watering. I'm sure he'll be back,'' said trainer Chris Wall's wife,
Carole.
Wall was registering his tenth success and is going all out to beat
his seasonal best tally of 18.
Mark Prescott's Non Dimenticar Me looked an interesting proposition
with George Duffield preferring the filly to stablemate First Crush, a
winner at Brighton.
But the 2-1 shot was soon out of the reckoning after her saddle
slipped at the start of the Sanna's Post Claiming Stakes.
The favourite Bold Angel was the main beneficiary staying on strongly
to defeat Super Benz by one-and-a-half lengths.
* TRAINER Angela Knight has decided not to appeal against a Jockey
Club disciplinary committee decision to withdraw her licence for six
months.
The Cullompton trainer was found to be in breach of the rules
concerning percentage payments to her stable staff at a Portman Square
inquiry on July 12.
Her licence to train has been withdrawn with effect from July 31.

Ross Finlay drives a 4x4 that would be quite at home in a wartime
filmset
SEVERAL books about the war in the Western Desert recall the
adventures of mobile raiding units. Popski's Private Army was the
smallest independent command among all the British forces operating in
North Africa, and eventually  in Italy. It started with five officers,
18 other ranks, two three-ton trucks and four heavily armed jeeps. Given
its title from the nickname of its CO, Major Vladimir Peniakoff, PPA
raided behind enemy lines, blew up fuel dumps and several times
hoodwinked larger enemy units into surrendering to its own tiny
jeep-borne forces. One of the most amazing elements in its story was how
its heavily laden jeeps coped with terrain as different as extensive
sand dunes and the mountain goat-tracks known to Italian partisans.
Willys-Overland produced more than 360,000 wartime jeeps, which took
their name from their designation as ''general purpose'' transport. They
saw service in most theatres of the war. Later, Kaiser and American
Motors developed peacetime versions. Now, with a capital letter, Jeep is
part of Chrysler Corporation, but other companies which do not actually
use the hallowed name can build jeep-type vehicles, and several take the
opportunity to do so.
One modern version of the original wartime jeep is imported here from
India. The other is the Rocsta from South Korea. They have a tiny but
just identifiable market in the UK, as part of the light 4x4 leisure
vehicle sector, although the importers would also like to interest
people like farmers, vets and civil engineers whose work often takes
them into roughish terrain.
Asia Motors, a large-scale subsidiary of Kia, with export markets in
100 countries, has designed a sturdy vehicle which, if it hardly comes
with twin Vickers machine-guns and racks of spare petrol cans as seen on
Popski's jeeps, would not look entirely out of place in the background
of a 1940s desert-war film.
Modern features include a robust roll-over bar for the soft-top
models, and chunky wheels, but that is just about where the
sophistication ends. The Rocsta has a basic if well enough trimmed
interior, fair passenger space in front but not nearly so much behind, a
non-dipping mirror and a crunching ride. The importers modified the
suspension after it had been on the UK market for only five months, but
the long-term effect may still be like that experienced years ago by a
sports car driver who was advised to give up horse-riding, when in fact
most of his outings were in a cart-sprung HRG.
The Rocsta comes with either a 77bhp 1.8-litre petrol engine or a
61bhp 2.2-litre diesel. You can have a normal fabric hood or a hardtop,
and there are two equipment levels. I have been driving a diesel DX
soft-top at #9800, which is the price of two of the models on sale here,
with the entry-level versions at #300 less. You would have to weigh
these prices against the fact that this is by no means the usual run of
family 4x4s.
In diesel form, the Rocsta is absolutely flat-out at 70mph, but from
the point of view of noise levels, bounce and stability I was happier
cruising it around 55mph. At higher speeds, too, there is a
whip-cracking effect as the wind rams into the hood. However, the engine
is quite a sturdy performer. When revved hard the DX will accelerate
well enough to hold its own in most normal traffic.
What the Rocsta does with ease is clatter over rough roads, and,
because it has a transfer box as well as the ability to switch from
two-wheel to four-wheel drive, it is a charge-along off-roader. The
axles have good articulation, and it is a strong climber. Build quality
is fine, and there is standard provision, sensible in a vehicle which
may often be parked hood-down, of lockable storage space under the
seats.

Stewart Fraser has advice for new sailors planning a maiden voyage
You have a boat and want to put your sailing knowledge into practice.
So where do you go and what do you do? There's a booklet, Yacht Moorings
in the Highlands and Islands, available from the Tourist Board, Sail
Scotland, or marinas. Handy if you have some time on your hands. And the
moorings are free to visiting boats.
The thing is to make a realistic estimate of time. What does your sail
boat do -- with the wind, against the wind, and on average? What does
your power boat do, in calm waters and in a blow? Where do you want to
go -- and can you get back in time for school and the office? Will you
have time to step ashore, do some extra shopping, send a postcard if you
must? On the east coast, a day sail could probably get you down to Fife.
A week, up to the Moray Firth or down to Northumbria. Always bear in
mind how far you have managed already and how it compares with what you
have in mind. Being realistic keeps everything sensible.
For the west, there is the A, B, C of Arran, Bute and the Cumbraes. Is
it feasible to get round them in one day? Is Tighnabruaich and the Burnt
Isles a reasonable outing? Take advice from those who have done it
before, and can give you confidence in your first time out.
They can also advise what to take with you. For a day trip, a flask of
coffee or a can of soft drink, with ready-made sandwiches may well be
enough for al fresco catering. Any longer, and you need to be aware of
the possible vagaries of a gas-burning stove. Try it before you go and
gauge what its capabilities are. Before an important outing, these small
things will bring confidence in your own abilities.
Make a list including suitable clothes, plus a change, if the weather
happens to be wet. Food and drink, with some means of heating it, and
cleaning up after. Charts, to get to your desert island, and a compass
to steer by. Binoculars to watch for seals and sharks, sea birds and
submarines.
Remember pencil and paper, and keep a log or a diary to read in the
winter days. A sleeping bag, a hot water bottle -- you need little
comforts at times -- and pills to prevent sea sickness.
By all means, go down to the local chandlers. Inspect the books and
instruments, and the latest items on show. Get a new dinghy or tender --
or at least make sure your old one is in good shape. The same goes for
the outboard engine.
Anything else? Sun protection lotion and good sunglasses. The sea
reflects the light, and it's easy to get burned. Also soft-soled shoes
for parading around the deck.
Take extra bulbs for the navigation lights -- and do make sure you
know when to use them. Go to the library and get a book on sailing, the
kind that tells you everything including the International Rules for the
Prevention of Collisions at Sea.
In other words, have some idea of how to conduct yourself when afloat.
For example, when to give way to another boat. Do so, if in doubt, and
make it clear what you are doing. Learn how to put down an anchor and
how to get it up again without straining your back. Remember to fly your
ensign.
Have a ''dry trip'', on the chart at home, before you set out. Let the
Coastguard know where you are going on a longer trip, and your ETA
(estimated time of arrival). They'll keep an eye out for you.

WOULD it be missed? Does the UK banking system really need National
Westminster to maintain healthy competition and customer choice when its
product range is somewhat undistinguished and its only serious global or
world class operation is NatWest Markets.
Not even that enthralls one highly-successful, and grey-haired fund
manager who argued yesterday that there is a blurring of image there
with first County Bank which became County NatWest, the absorption of
Wood Mackenzie and now its present title . . . he is happy with the
equity research effort.
To paraphase former US Secretary of State Averell Harriman talking
about Britain, NatWest does seem to be seeking a role.
There is a gut feeling among some that there is a absence of decision
in the bank which lacks the new found and apparently well-founded
dynamism of Barclays under Martin Taylor, the sagacity of Lloyds' Sir
Brian Pitman and the huge pockets of Midland under the aegis of HSBC,
while both the TSB and Abbey National do have highly-effective
franchises in insurance and mortgages respectively which should insulate
them against most chills.
Also the Royal Bank has the comfort of Direct Line, Citizens in the US
and IBOS, while the Mound has its Scottish branch network and its
corporate connections to keep it warm.
The bearish feeling was underlined at yesterday's interim results
where chief executive Derek Wanless was putting more emphasis on cost
cutting, reorganisation and concentrating on core activities.
The overall cost income ratio, admittedly not a perfect measure,
actually rose 1.5% year on year to 74.2%, the highest among the UK
banks, although it is expected now to decline but will take a
considerable period to drop to about 62% where one would be more
comfortable.
But then that depends upon income growth in the long term.
The core UK retail banking saw a 4600 drop in employee numbers to
50,500 as information technology and branch closures continued their
inroads.
To be fair there were some bullish factors.
Pre-tax profits in the half-year to June rose 13.7% to #872m. The UK
loan book rose about 2% to #52bn which is a welcome sign of recovering
confidence, albeit most of that was due to greater mortgage lending
where margins are often paper thin for many lenders. However, there was
a larger contribution from the volatile NatWest Markets which brought in
an extra #7m at #208m, that is #50m greater than in the December
half-year.
The basic High Street banking operations saw little changed
profitability on the preceding half year, reflecting in part a dreadful
experience in life assurance. There, the success of competitors such as
Abbey National and Lloyds Abbey Life has become evident with NatWest
life profits down 29% to #42m. That has led to 500 job losses to reduce
costs but while chairman Lord Alexander was adamant that in the medium
term there will be a recovery while other providers fall by the wayside,
it would seem essential that NatWest either joint ventures with another
major player, makes a significant acquisition or retrenches to become
just a niche participant.
There have been good recoveries such as the Lombard personal and small
business lending subsidiary which plunged to a mere #3m profit for the
whole of 1990 compared with the latest six months' #105m although that
will undoubtedly see growth flattening off as new car sales seem likely
to be unexciting.
In the US, Bancorp has also bounced back to ruddy health and Mr
Wanless is determined not to move outside the ''geographic footprint''
to use his jargon.
He was also happy to talk generally about potential acquisitions
although nothing was done over Barings, Kleinwort Benson nor Smith New
Court let alone Warburg, the last named being probably just as well.
The interim dividend has been raised 15% to 8.4p and on the basis of
full-year profits increasing from #1592m to about #1800m, the shares at
579p trade at just 8.9 times likely earnings while yielding 5.4% on a
possible 25p dividend total.
Surely the crux is that Mr Wanless said that NatWest is a large and
complex organisation. No-one would argue that point. However the case
for it either to make a major UK High Street acquisition or else be at
the receiving end of a reverse takeover from a more focused financial
institution does carry some weight.

Tokyo, Tuesday -- Japan's finance minister vowed today to prevent an
erosion of confidence in the country's financial system after a massive
run on deposits at Tokyo's largest credit union.
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said his ministry and Japan's
central bank would work together to allay fears about the Japanese
financial system after weekend media reports that Cosmo Shinyo Kumiai
was in trouble prompted many Cosmo depositors to withdraw their savings
yesterday.
''The issue is protecting depositors and preventing the spread of
fears about the credibility of Japan's financial system,'' he told
reporters after today's cabinet meeting.
''We, in co-operation with the Bank of Japan, will do our utmost to
prevent other institutions from being affected by Cosmo's woes,'' he had
told NHK public television earlier.
Later in the day, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) followed through on a
promise to provide Cosmo with special loans -- the first such move since
the central bank gave loans in 1965 to Yamaichi Securities to keep it
afloat during a securities slump.
But Takemura said that while Cosmo's depositors would be protected,
the institution itself would become defunct.
A Tokyo metropolitan government official said later that Cosmo's
business was likely to be transferred to Tokyo Kyodo Bank, a special
bank set up in March to take over the business of two debt-ridden Tokyo
credit firms.
A BoJ-led scheme to create Tokyo Kyodo sparked an outcry early this
year over using public money for the two firms, mired in allegations of
breach of trust and influence-peddling.
The Tokyo city official said authorities were having trouble
persuading any other institution to take on Cosmo.
Financial authorities ordered Cosmo yesterday to halt most of its
business. They also unveiled a scheme using public money to protect
customers of the credit union -- an institution that takes deposits and
lends money to members.
The plan was agreed in a series of emergency meetings after Cosmo
depositors withdrew savings amounting to 60 billion yen ($681m). But the
pace of withdrawals slowed by Tuesday, when Cosmo said they totalled
19.2 billion yen ($218m).
Meanwhile, Cosmo's deposit run was not spilling over into the rest of
the industry, an official for the Shinkumi Federation Bank -- a national
federation of credit co-operatives -- said yesterday.

ELECTRICITY distributor Manweb yesterday hinted at a Northern
Electric-style defence to ScottishPower's #1000m bid, writes IAN
McCONNELL.
Chief executive John Roberts told shareholders at the company's annual
meeting that ''Manweb remains in a strong position to continue its
policy of enhancing shareholder value through a further restructuring of
its balance sheet''.
Repeating his call to shareholders to take no action, he said
ScottishPower's bid was an opening gambit and did not fully reflect the
value of Manweb.
Analysts predict shareholders will be tempted with a package of
special dividends, Preference shares and a slice of Manweb's stake in
the National Grid, worth about 425p per share in total.
However, both Bill McCall at stockbroker Tilney and Andrew Wright at
Smith New Court believe ScottishPower would win Manweb with a slightly
higher cash-plus-shares offer of #10 per Manweb share.
Mr McCall said: ''I think we are beyond the posturing stage and we are
now into the real combat.''
With ScottishPower shares up 1p at 316p and Manweb off 7p on 868p
yesterday, the value of the Glasgow-based generator and distributor's
existing cash-plus-shares bid has risen to 955p.
Manweb will undoubtedly be keen, in the first instance, to prove it is
worth more than ScottishPower's 915p per share cash alternative.
A defence of the type mounted by Northern Electric against the bid by
Trafalgar House could be preceded by the profits and dividend forecast
which Manweb intends to release for its current year to end-March.
The Chester-based company, which yesterday referred to the prospective
price/earnings multiple of 13.5 implicit in the #2500m agreed bid for
Eastern Group which was announced by Hanson on Monday, is keen to show
ScottishPower's offer in a poor light next to this.
However, ScottishPower would argue that Manweb requires a lot more
work than Eastern.
The Glasgow-based utility's formal offer document, which is unlikely
to contain anything new, is expected next week.
Manweb will then have to issue its defence before the end of August.
Meanwhile, the fall in Manweb's share price yesterday may reflect
increasing fears of a monopolies probe of the ScottishPower bid.
Electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild said yesterday that
additional measures could be needed to protect customers if Hanson's bid
for Eastern went ahead. His comments echoed those he made in the wake of
ScottishPower's bid announcement.
Mr Roberts indicated Manweb's ability to produce a defence package by
highlighting the fact that the company's gearing is only 21%.
He claimed outperformance of ScottishPower in terms of share-price
performance and dividend growth. However, both analysts and
ScottishPower would argue that the much tighter regulatory regime which
has until recently applied north of the Border has had a bearing.
Although Mr Roberts claimed a greater reduction than ScottishPower in
standard domestic tariffs, Manweb's current tariff, at 9.03p, is the
second-highest in the UK. ScottishPower's is only 8.36p.

THE Bank of England's quarterly inflation report, which will be
published this morning, is again expected to warn the Government that if
interest rates are not changed, underlying inflation will be above the
target of 2.5% when the current Parliament expires in less than two
years.
Little has changed since May when the last report was published. Days
earlier the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, was rebuffed
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, when he pressed for
a half point rise in rates.
The Bank was forced to publish a no-holds-barred report critical of
the Government for failing to respond to the inflationary pressures
generated by sterling's fall from grace this year, and the continuation
of above-trend growth.
The two men have been at odds on rates since then. The Chancellor's
determination to stay his hand has been strengthened by a run of weak
economic data. Even so, the second quarter gross domestic product
figures still showed that the economy was growing at above its trend
rate of 2.25%.
The pound has remained in the doldrums. Last night its trade-weighted
index was 83.3, a fraction weaker than the 83.4 when the May inflation
report was published. At this level it has lost 5.9% of its
international value this year.
The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has no reason to alter its
inflation forecast significantly, though it might be prepared to concede
that the risks were more evenly balanced, whereas in May they were all
on the upside.
Meanwhile, the Purchasing Managers' prices index eased back in July,
but remained at a disturbingly high level. The overall index recovered,
but remains appreciably lower than it was in the spring. This suggests
that the manufacturing sector has slowed down.
The seasonally adjusted prices index fell from 75.8 in June to 72.5
last month, its lowest reading since December. It peaked at 79.6 in
April.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which compiles the
indices, said that higher steel prices and continued weakness of
sterling were noted by many companies, although there was a marked fall
in the number of price rises linked to supply shortages, particularly
for paper products.
James Capel's Adam Cole said the decline in the prices index reflected
the easing in commodity price pressures in recent months. But he warned:
''The index remains well above post-devaluation levels, suggesting only
a slight moderation in input price pressures.''
One saving grace was a marked improvement in suppliers' delivery times
(from 43.3 to 45.7 -- the highest for a year), which suggests that input
price pressures could ease significantly over the coming months.
The main, seasonally adjusted, Purchasing Managers' Index rose from
51.8 in June to 52.3 -- still well below the levels recorded last year
when the manufacturing sector was booming. Activity has expanded for 32
months running, but the pace has slowed sharply in the latest three
months.
The improvement in the main index resulted, for the most part, from an
increase in the growth rate of output. The output index rose for the
second successive month to 54.5 from 52.7 in June. Among reasons cited
for this were improvements in productivity and capacity utilisation and
the need to meet strong demand.
The expansion of output was accompanied by an increase in recruitment.
The employment index jumped from 49.9 in June to 52.3. This was the
first rise in employment since March and was largely explained by the
need to keep up with full order books. There were reports of fewer
redundancies.
The institute's director-general, Peter Thomson, said: ''This paints a
picture of a more settled and balanced manufacturing economy, where
demand is strong but easier to manage and output is healthy. Investment
in capacity is paying off and firms are now better eqipped to cope with
new orders.''

UNICHEM is increasing its retail presence in Scotland with the #17.5m
acquisition of the Scottish retail pharmacy group Baddon Holdings. The
purchase takes Unichem's retail presence in Scotland, through its E Moss
pharmacy chain, up to a total of 76.
Baddon is a family owned group consisting of 23 wholly owned
pharmacies across central Scotland, from Glasgow to Edinburgh. It
employs about 240 people all but two of whom are to be retained by
Unichem. Two posts in Baddon's small head office are being transferred
down to Unichem's north London office.
In addition to the 23 pharmacies, two of which were acquired in
Kilbirnie in south west Scotland after the year-end, Baddon has other
retail interests. These are a majority interest in two large health
centre pharmacies, at Easterhouse and Meadowbank and one drugstore which
is to be converted into a pharmacy.
In the year to 31 May 1994, Baddon reported a profit before tax and
interest of just over #478,000 on sales of #12.8m. Net assets were
#3.23m. The Badden assets will be absorbed into Unichem's E Moss retail
pharmacy chain. Baddon will use Unichem's wholesalers for product
ordering, for the first time.
Jeff Harris, chief executive of Unichem, said that the acquisition was
significant in that it substantially increased Unichem's presence in
Scotland, which he described as ''a large and important market''. In
addition he said it continued Unichem's policy of selectively purchasing
high quality pharmacies and pharmacy groups. ''This acquisition
represents a further step in the development of our integrated
healthcare group'' he added.
The Badden acquisition consolidates Moss' position as the UK's third
largest pharmacy chain with 407 outlets. However it is still much
smaller than Boots, the market leader and the number two in the market
Lloyds Chemists. Unichem entered the retailing market only three years
ago having previously concentrated on consolidating its position as the
UK's leading pharmaceutical wholesaler.
However it has built up a strong business which not only provides an
additional revenue stream but also incremental sales for the wholesaling
operation. Moss has made a name for itself in providing profitable
in-store pharmacies in major food superstores. There are over 40
pharmacies throughout the UK including 37 within Asda superstores and
franchises in Sainsbury and Tesco superstores.
Unichem has above average, and almost guaranteed, growth prospects
given the expected increase in the prescription medicines market based
on an ageing population. Its strong market positions in wholesaling and
retailing should enable it to weather any difficulties in the trading
environment. Unichem's growth will be organic supplemented by
acquisitions.
News of the latest acquisition saw Unichem shares add a penny to 276p.

WROXALL Extreme (pictured above), the bull which has led the Simmental
Society's performance trials at Warwickshire College of Agriculture, has
been purchased in a private deal by Scottish Livestock Services for its
stud at Newlands in Perthshire.
Jack Lawson, managing director of SLS, said: ''We have always been
famed for our Simmental stud, therefore the overall performance of
Wroxhall Extreme, coupled with his fantastic growth rate and muscling
ability, made him a must for our supersires group.''
A grandson of Blackford Rory, Extreme has been described by his
breeder, veteran Simmental expert Dan Evans, as the best bull he has
ever bred.
Semen from Extreme will be available in the autumn.

THE sheep industry will have to move into a higher gear if it is
survive in the future, according to Neil Taylor, European director of
the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board.
Part of this would depend on using new technology to improve breeding
and management, but more critically it would depend on getting a bigger
share of the added value market.
''Producing quality raw materials and selling these at farm gate or
sale yards is not the recipe for income growth,'' he told delegates to
the 1995 World Sheep and Wool Congress at Malvern in Worcestershire.
''Increasingly the consumer wants a higher-quality, further-processed
product in which the raw material cost is a diminishing proportion in
percentage or even absolute terms. So to gain a higher proportion of
that increased value, ownership of the product further down the chain is
essential.''
Consumers repeatedly demonstrated they were prepared to pay top prices
for the right product. Yet sheep flocks worldwide were at best stable if
not declining and the sheep producer was making lower profits. This
indicated a presentational and positional problem, but one that could be
tackled.
Meat and Livestock Commission speakers Brian Kilkenny and Julian Bryan
took a similar line. ''Traditional lamb joints and cuts are -- and will
remain -- a very important part of the British diet,'' said Mr Kilkenny.
''But if lamb is to retain a significant share as the centre of meals,
it must be prepared, processed and presented in new ways. It is only
through creative thinking that the sheepmeat industry will satisfy the
customer and ensure its own future.''
Outlining MLC strategy overall, Mr Bryan said: ''This is based on
repositioning lamb as a convenient, high-quality product to reflect its
new and higher price positioning and to address the issue of its older
consumer profile.'' He noted that total lamb and mutton consumption in
Britain increased by 1.7% last year.
Speakers from the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) and elsewhere
confirmed there was no lack of modern technology to improve lamb output
and quality, whether by embryo sexing, manipulation or transfer.
But as Professor Colin Spedding of the Farm Animal Welfare Council and
others pointed out, lamb is almost unique in being able to cash in on
consumer perceptions of a ''green'' image with high welfare standards
implying a high degree of food safety. Such perceptions could make an
impact on consumer demand.
Dr Geoff Simm of the SAC admitted the perceived or real animal welfare
implications of some new techniques and the consumer acceptability of
others were becoming increasingly important in some countries. This made
it essential that resources were available for applied research and
development to ensure that appropriate new technologies were translated
into farming practice.

Washington, Tuesday
THE Attorney-General, Janet Reno, was brought before a congressional
committee today in a final attempt by the Republicans there to make some
capital out of the Waco disaster.
Miss Reno defended herself and the president vigorously. She
repudiated suggestions that he had given detailed approval to every step
in the siege of the Branch Davidians' compound, and the final attack on
it on April 19, 1993.
It was all done by the Justice Department, she said, by the FBI, and
the Bureau of Firearms. The president was kept informed, but the
decisions were all her own.
This is the line she took when the attempt to flush out the Davidians
with tear gas led them to set fire to the building, and perish in the
flames. Some 86 people were killed.
Miss Reno won a political points at the time by her resolute refusal
to evade her responsibility. So far, she has escaped the blame that
might be thought to accrue to anyone whose decisions proved so
disastrously wrong.
Brief congressional hearings at the time, directed by the Democrats,
exonerated everyone and briskly swept the whole issue under the carpet.
The Justice Department issued a report, clearing itself of all blame,
criticising some junior officials for excess of zeal but leaving senior
officials comfortably untouched.
The whole thing would have sunk into the mists of memory had not some
fanatics seized on the incident as proof that the federal government is
a conspiracy to destroy America's liberties, and bombed the Oklahoma
federal building on the second anniversary of Waco.
The right-wing Republicans in Congress, who are in the ascendancy,
accept some of the militias' theology. They march to the drum of the
National Rifle Association, which denounces federal police as
''jack-booted thugs'', a new Gestapo. We have heard much of this during
the Waco hearings.
Much time has also been devoted to an effort to blame the president
personally. As a result of these two red herrings, what has been given
short shrift is the gross incompetence and stupidity of the FBI, the
Bureau of Firearms, and Miss Reno and her officials.
Some Congressmen tried valiantly to pin down the attorney-general, as
they tried with her subordinates, on how they could have been so stupid
as to mount a full-scale attack on a conspicuous fire-trap of a building
filled with heavily armed fanatics at at least two dozen small children.
They made very little progress.

BRITAIN'S first woman soldier-sailor, an army officer who will spend
her career at sea, cast off for the Balkans war zone yesterday.
Captain Debbie Farleigh, 27, made history after being appointed second
in command of Her Majesty's Army Vessel Ardennes, running supplies to
front-line troops.
Captain Farleigh is the only woman army officer to be trained in
maritime skills and won her present job by volunteering for the 19-month
course.
''I qualified as an Ocean Watchkeeper earlier this year which means I
take my turn at navigating the ship, also as First Lieutentant I am the
admin and welfare officer,'' she said. ''I am here because the army
believes I am the right person for the job.''
The HMAV Ardennes is crewed by soldiers from the Port and Maritime
Regiment of the Royal Logistics Corps. On active service it has a full
compliment of 36 men, and now one woman.
Before training at Sandhurst in 1991, Captain Farleigh read Ecological
Sciences at Edinburgh University after attending Peterhead Academy,
Aberdeen, and Eastwood High School, Glasgow, where she swam for the West
of Scotland.
''This is my first operational role,'' she said, ''and while there was
a little bit of tension on board today when the weapons were being
loaded -- bringing the thought, 'this is the real thing' -- I am really
looking forward to it.''
She has no problem with her unique status on ship. ''The men were
obviously a little surprised to have a woman officer on board, but they
gave me a great welcome.''

Vienna, Tuesday
A SIX-YEAR-OLD Austrian girl whose cancerous tumour grew dramatically
while her parents and medical authorities battled over treatment now has
less than 10% chance of survival, doctors say.
Franz Waldhauser, deputy head of Vienna's General Hospital, said that
Olivia Pilhar's condition had worsened as the quickly growing tumour in
her abdomen expanded to more than 9lb and was now crushing her right
lung and other vital organs.
''The question is whether we will make it for a few more days or
whether the tumour will crush the child to death,'' Waldhauser told a
news conference.
Against the will of the girl's parents, doctors began chemotherapy
treatment yesterday to reduce the size of the tumour after a court
stripped the parents of custody rights.
The court action followed a ruling by a team of medical experts that
determined she would die without medicine.
Pilhar's parents had been refusing medical treatment on the advice of
a German ''miracle healer'' named Ryke Gerd Hamer, who advocates natural
remedies.
A warrent has been issued for Hamer's arrest and Olivia's father,
Helmut Pilhar, has said he has been warned that he will be arrested if
he tries to enter the hospital.
Waldhauser said that doctors hoped to reduce the size of the tumour
with chemotherapy treatment before they could operate on the massive
tumour, which has grown to 15 times the size when it was first
diagnosed.
''The tumour is growing with frightening speed,'' Waldhauser said.
''Olivia's abdomen is expanding by a centimetre each day,'' he said,
adding that the blood supply to vital organs was being endangered by the
tumour.
The girl is under sedation and receiving artificial respiration.
Waldhauser said that doctors had no experience with tumours of such a
vast size and that earlier predictions that she had a 20% to 40% of
survival were for smaller tumours.
''One has no experience with growths of this size,'' he said.
''Treatment has never been delayed to this point in the past.''
Waldhauser said that although the father will be arrested if he enters
the hospital, Olivia's mother was now co-operating with physicians and
spends about three hours each day with the girl.
He said he hoped both parents would support their last-ditch efforts
to save the girl's life.
''We've reached the point where the ice is so thin that we have to ask
ourselves whether it will hold up at all,'' he said.--Reuter.

Ntarama, Tuesday
SOUTH African Archbishop Desmond Tutu broke down and sobbed on seeing
hundreds of skulls, bones, and decomposed bodies, victims of last year's
genocide in Rwanda, but said the last word had to be forgiveness.
The Nobel peace prize winner almost collapsed wailing as he toured a
massacre site at Ntarama church where up to 1000 men, women, and
children were butchered at the height of the genocide.
''This is something the scale of which we have never seen in South
Africa,'' said Tutu, supported by an aide and sobbing on seeing the
church filled with human remains, including bodies draped over pews.
Ntarama is one of the massacre sites left as a memorial to last year's
horrors, in which up to one million Tutsis and Hutu moderates were
butchered by Hutu troops, militiamen, and mobs in three months of
bloodletting.
Tutu was led away towards his car but returned to see the rest of the
dead -- lines of skulls, including one with a piece of a knife embedded
in it, and bones displayed around the church.
He then visited the nearby Nelson Mandela peace village for widows and
orphans of one of history's worst genocides.
''Today we visited the dead in Ntarama. I am shattered,'' Tutu told
leaders, diplomats, and churchmen in his address in the capital Kigali.
''We give thanks to God for all of you . . . who have been so
traumatised, who have suffered to the extent you have suffered, but have
somehow been given the capacity to hold back your anger, your
bitterness, and your natural desire for revenge,'' he added.
Tutu, on the final day of a visit to Rwanda, endorsed calls for
justice made by the Rwandan Government, but said he feared that
resentment would build in those looking for a chance to get their own
back.
''And so I make my appeal: that our sisters and brothers must know
there can be no future without forgiveness, there will be no future
unless there is peace, there can be no peace unless there is
reconciliation,'' he said.
Tutu was cheered by thousands of inmates when he toured the capital's
prison, which is so overcrowded that many prisoners have to sit shoulder
to shoulder most of the time. Tutu said the conditions were a disaster
waiting to happen.--Reuter.

Paris, Tuesday
FRANCE recalled its ambassador from Australia today after Canberra
barred a French company from competing for a lucrative defence contract
in protest at Paris's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South
Pacific.
Australia called the French move ''a pity'' but made clear its
decision to bar Dassault Aviation from tendering for a #493m jet fighter
package was meant to hammer the message home to President Jacques
Chirac.
French Defence Minister Charles Millon said he was still prepared to
meet his Australian counterpart to explain the reasons behind France's
decision.
In a serious rebuff at home, the first opinion poll on nuclear testing
since Chirac's June 14 decision showed 56% of French voters think he was
wrong to resume tests and 60% hope he will change his mind.
Millon denied a French news agency report that the underground tests
planned at Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific would begin this month to
beat a protest flotilla to the draw.
''The nuclear tests will be held between September 1 and May 31,''
Millon told reporters. ''Since some people would like to prevent these
tests with over-the-top demonstrations, you will understand that we are
keeping the exact dates confidential.''
The Foreign Ministry announced it was recalling ambassador Dominique
Girard hours after Australian Defence Minister Robert Ray announced the
jet fighter decision.
A Ministry statement listed a series of previous hostile gestures
including stopping mail to the French embassy, delaying diplomatic bags,
allowing protesters to obstruct access to the French embassy, and
delaying French ships in Australian ports.
The loss of the potential contract for 35-40 light fighters was the
most serious economic price Paris has yet had to pay for the anger
sparked across the Pacific region by Chirac's June 14 decision to end a
three-year freeze on nuclear weapons tests.--Reuter.

A UNIQUE bond between two churches will be strengthened next week when
an American couple fly from Oklahoma City to marry in the Aberdeenshire
village of Monymusk, bringing a 50-memberchoir with them.
The close links between Monymusk Parish Church and Westminster
Presbyterian Church date back to 1958, when the minister of the time,
the Rev Inglis Black, spent time working in Oklahoma.
Monymusk Parish Church is more than 800 years old and became the
''mother church'' to its the Oklahoma counterpart, which was just 12
years old.
The first date for the choir will be the wedding of members Arthur
MacHugh and Susan McCoy, which will be conducted by the Rev Euan Glen,
the current minister at Monymusk, who was responsible for the recent
revival of the links.
After the marriage ceremony, there will be a tour of the church and
the surrounding district. In the evening, the newlyweds will join their
choir for a public performance of choral and American spiritual music.
After Monymusk, the choir's only other Scottish performance is at St
Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh.

<RECORDNO>977092668</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
WRITER Jane Austen may have been a lesbian who had an incestuous
relationship with her sister, says a controversial new review of her
letters.
Dr Terry Castle, professor of English at California's Stanford
University, claims many of the happy endings in Austen's novels were
designed to enable her heroines to form a union with her heroes'
sisters.
Austen, who turned down two marriage proposals, lived with sister,
Cassandra, at a cottage in Chawton, Hampshire, where they shared a bed.
The author of six novels, including Pride and Prejudice and Emma, died
unmarried in 1817 at the age of 42.
Writing in the London Review of Books, Dr Castle claimed ''Cassandra
was the person around whom her life revolved'' and that Jane's letters
showed ''the passionate nature of the sibling bond''.
Jane and Cassandra both remained spinsters, and Dr Castle commented:
''One can't help but feel that both found greater comfort and pleasure
in remaining with one another.''
She added: ''When Austen encounters, rarely, a man who disturbs her
sexual self-possession, her protestations of dislike are liable to
become spinsterish and strident.''
In contrast, she said Austen's physical descriptions of women ''are
funny, complex, often poignant, and as exquisitely drawn as any in her
fiction.
''Yet they inevitably reveal, too, what can only be called a kind of
homophilic fascination. Unlike men, women have bodies -- to be
scrutinised and discussed, admired or found wanting.''
The claims of lesbianism were swiftly dismissed by Austen scholars.
Expert Claire Tomalin declared: ''I think it's about as likely that
Jane Austen was gay as that she was found out to be a man.''

ABERDEEN'S Science and Technology Park (ASTP) is changing strategy to
help encourage the development of software companies, an area in which
Grampian Enterprise sees huge potential for the region.
Companies attracted to the area because of the oil boom are
discovering the wider applications for their technology and between one
quarter and one third of Scotland's software companies are now based in
Grampian, which is worth an estimated #250m a year to the area.
''When you speak to companies which you would expect to be primarily
oil and gas related, you discover that more and more of them are
deriving an increasing proportion of their revenue from non oil and gas
business,'' said Dr Gary Evans, Grampian Enterprise's head of advanced
technology.
''What they do tend to be is generic. If they can provide a solution
for one particular company, an oil company, it can often apply to a food
company or any other company.''
Six new tenants have been attracted to the park in the past six months
and Dr Jones believes this recent success is due to the change in
emphasis of Grampian Enterprise's strategy from the provision of
accommodation to more substantial business support.
The park, established in 1989 on a 67-acre site at Bridge of Don, now
has 33 tenants and he hopes that they can step up the rate of attracting
new companies to two a month.

A NEW seed-crushing mill at Arbroath, which will be the only one of
its kind in the United Kingdom, is due to begin production next month,
creating 35 new jobs in its first year of operation.
Over the past few months Seed Crushers (Scotland) Limited has been
busy adapting a former textile works on the town's Elliot Industrial
Estate as part of a #5m investment programme which will allow the
oilseed rape harvest to be processed locally for the first time.
New foundations have been laid and flooring has been strengthened to
bear the weight of specialist equipment. Silos and storage tanks have
also been installed to hold incoming oilseed rape and the mill's two end
products -- meal for animal feed and crude rapeseed oil destined for
industry or for refinement for food use.
Amritash Agrawalla, a director of Seed Crushers (Scotland), said that
the mill had been designed to make use of the most advanced
technological processes. The cooker would avoid the need for chemicals
which were used in rapeseed oil production at other plants in Britain,
he added.
The mill chimneys have been fitted with vapour scrubbing equipment to
ensure that the cleanliness standards of emissions exceed current
European standards.
The mill is located in the centre of Scotland's oilseed rape
production belt -- nearly two-thirds of the national crop is grown in
Grampian, Tayside and Fife.
Gordon Langlands, company development manager with Scottish Enterprise
Tayside, said: ''This new mill will offer local farmers a nearby outlet
for their harvest and add value to the crop without it having to leave
the country. We see this as filling a gap in the market.''
In its first year the company plans to process 20,000 tonnes of
oilseed rape and hopes to see this figure rise to 50,000 tonnes a year.
The bulk of the Scottish crop will still be exported either to England
or to Europe for processing. Mr Agrawalla said that the possibility of
building a refinery in Scotland was one which his company might look at
in the future.

A WAR veteran was jailed for a year yesterday after admitting drugs
charges.
William Parker, 74, was caught with more than 50,000 Temazepam tablets
worth up to #150,000.
The haul was found hidden in wardrobes and a cupboard in his home at
St Peter's Path, Woodside, Glasgow.
Defending lawyer Bob McCormack told Sheriff Iain Peebles that his
client was a former merchant seaman who had served on war-time convoys
in the north Atlantic.
''He has led a blameless life and was given a medal by Russia and
mentioned in despatches by the Admiralty,'' he told Glasgow Sheriff
Court.
Mr McCormack said a stranger had called at Parker's home and left bags
saying someone else would collect them.
Parker admitted possessing Temazepam in his home on June 27 last year
with intent to supply it.
Jailing Parker, Sheriff Peebles said he accepted that it was an
unusual case and that the accused was a first offender with a good war
record.
However, he said he could not ignore the fact the accused was aware a
vast amount of drugs were in his home and had held on to them over a
weekend to be collected.
The sheriff said he was exercising the utmost leniency in limiting the
sentence to one year.
As he left the dock, Parker turned and waved to his wife Catherine,
70, in the public benches. She was charged with the same offence but the
Crown accepted her plea of not guilty at an earlier hearing.

RANGERS' star striker Ally McCoist is to be forced to demolish a wall
at his home in a Bridge of Weir conservation area.
Planning chiefs criticised the Ibrox footballer for building the
extension around his mansion to prevent prying eyes. They said the
construction was a serious breach of conservation area regulations.
The player was prevented from erecting a 6ft fence around his garden a
year ago when he asked Renfrew District Council for permission. He
claimed the enclosure was required to protect his privacy.
Planning officials rejected the proposal and advised him instead to
screen his property by planting trees.
Now he will be required to restore the wall to its original condition
by removing the two-metre section that was added to the original
structure.
A meeting of the local authority's planning and development committee
in Paisley yesterday heard that Mr McCoist will now be given 28 days to
restore the wall to its original height, after officials ruled the
extension had had an adverse impact and was detrimental to the amenity
of the outstanding conservation area he lives in.
Senior planning official Crawford Russell revealed that the
unauthorised extension was brought to his department's attention by a
neighbour.
He told councillors: ''We tried on two separate occasions to get the
owner to submit a restrospective planning application but he failed to
do so. The threat of an enforcement notice is now our only recourse.''
Mr McCoist had consulted planners before commencing work on the wall
extension, explaining that he required additional privacy around the
garden. In a report that was discussed fully by councillors, Mr Russell
said the player had simply ignored the advice he received.
He said: ''They were informed that such works would require planning
permission and that, furthermore, it would be difficult to match new
stone with that of the existing wall.
''They were advised that an acceptable method of screening could be
achieved by planting a fast-growing hedge behind the stone wall.''
Mr McCoist went ahead with the work but a neighbour wrote a letter of
complaint to the local authority.
Officials say the player has ignored two written warnings requesting
him to apply for retrospective permission.
A report condemning the quality of craftmanship states that the stone
spacing does not match and the cement render is lighter in colour than
the original and has run, leaving white vertical streaks down the
original wall.

A LAWYER was jailed for three years yesterday for a fraud involving a
multi-million-pound film which was to star Omar Sharif and Glenda
Jackson.
Euan McIlvride, 35, and his associate, Michael McLetchie, 38, duped a
film producer into giving them #22,000. They told Miss Kenteas Brine
they could raise #12m to bankroll her historical film called The Castle.
Miss Brine told the High Court in Glasgow during a five-week trial how
she borrowed the #22,000 from the late Sir John Anthony Langford-Holt, a
former Tory MP and Lloyds name.
Czech-born Miss Brine said she never received any finance or her
#22,000 back after building a #1m film set and was forced to sell her
home.
Both the accused, who denied the charges, were directors of RTR
Estates, of West Nile Street, Glasgow, which specialised in allegedly
raising finance for companies.
McIlvride, of Stewart Drive, Glasgow, smiled at a woman friend in the
court room yesterday as he was led away to start his sentence.
Sentence on McLetchie, of Islay Drive, Newton Mearns, was deferred
until August 11 to enable him to repay the money to Miss Brine after his
advocate, Miss Ruth Anderson, said the #22,000 was available.
McIlvride was also convicted by a jury of embezzling #3450 while
working as a lawyer for another firm seven years ago, and was found
guilty of embezzling #13,244 in a swindle involving a fishing boat.
McIlvride, acting for the skipper, gave him #37,000, less #2000 fees
for his fishing licence, then sold it for #50,000 to a firm in Buckie in
Banffshire.
The pair were cleared of other charges last month and appeared
yesterday for sentence.
McLetchie, married with two young daughters, runs a property
development company employing five people, the court heard.
He is currently converting a house into a nursing home and building
houses in Port Glasgow.
Miss Anderson told Temporary Judge Alexander Wilkinson, QC: ''I would
ask that you allow him to leave the court to return to his wife and
family and his employees who rely on him.''
McIlvride, who had earlier been suspended as a solicitor, will now be
struck off. He has been made bankrupt and his marriage has broken down,
the court heard.
Judge Wilkinson told McLetchie that he had been convicted of a
''sophisticated'' fraud.
He told McIlvride that he had carried out a series of deceptions and
had broken the trust that clients should expect from their solicitors.
Victims may now make claims for compensation to the Scottish
solicitors' client protection scheme.
The Law Society of Scotland last night welcomed the jailing of
McIlvride.
The society's chief accountant, Mr Leslie Cumming, who heads the
inspection team, said: ''The society employs 11 inspectors who carry out
routine inspections of solicitors' firms on a regular basis.
''It was as a result of such an inspection that the society had
concerns about Mr McIlvride's activities and suspended him from
practising.
''We then applied to the courts to have a judicial factor appointed to
manage his practice. We are pleased that the courts have handed out a
custodial sentence in this serious matter.''

THE Halifax Building Society is looking to the Government to bring in
specific measures to stimulate demand for housing as prices continue to
fall.
The society's house price index, the most authorative barometer of the
market, shows that seasonally-adjusted prices have fallen for the fifth
month running.
Confidence has been hit by the further erosion of mortgage tax relief
to 15% in April and Government plans to cut back on mortgage income
support.
Last month prices fell by 0.7% after drops of 0.4% in June and 1% in
May. In the latest 12 months prices have declined by 3.1% compared with
1.9% in the year to June.
New house prices recovered some of the ground lost in recent months
with a rise of 0.4%, but prices are still 1.8% lower than a year
earlier. Prices continued to fall in the first-time buyer sector.

TWO of the specialist investment trusts investing in the Lloyd's
insurance market have decided to merge, less than two years after their
formation.
Angerstein Underwriting Trust and Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust were
among the first of the new corporate investors in the insurance market.
This followed the relaxation of Lloyd's traditional unlimited liability
to allow corporate investors with limited liability to come into the
market to make up some of the shortfall in capacity caused by the
withdrawal of individual members.
Backed by Foreign &amp; Colonial, Delian raised #50m, while Angerstein,
promoted by NatWest Investment Management, raised #67m. They run
conventional investment trust portfolios while using them to back
underwriting commitments in Lloyd's.
The companies now feel that greater financial strength and recognition
are increasingly important for a corporate investor in Lloyd's. The
merger will be accomplished by a share exchange offer from Angerstein,
whose shares shed 4p to 92p against a 4p gain at 94p for Delian.
The combined group will have underwriting capacity of #214m. The
merger will also result in cost savings of #650,000 a year.

Bogota, Tuesday
COLOMBIA'S Congress has decided to conduct a formal investigation of
President Ernesto Samper following accusations that his election
campaign got large donations from drug traffickers.
Congressional sources said that the Accusations Committee of the House
of Representatives had decided to investigate the president and would
make a formal declaration shortly.
Samper himself last Thursday asked Congress to investigate him to
clear his name and lift suspicions that he knew or authorised the
receipt of large amounts of drug money to finance his campaign.
Samper's campaign treasurer, Santiago Medina -- who was arrested last
week on charges of illicit enrichment, perjury, and receipt of drug
money -- has alleged in testimony to prosecutors that Samper explicitly
instructed him to accept up to #2.4m in donations from the country's
biggest drug gang, the Cali cartel.
Samper said last week that if drug money entered his campaign it
happened without his knowledge or approval.
The accusations, which began last June days after Samper's narrow
election victory, have snowballed over the past few weeks, triggering
Colombia's worst political crisis in nearly 10 years.--Reuter.

A FOURTH residential home for the elderly in Strathclyde has lost its
registration because of council concerns about management standards.
The proprietors of the home in Largs, Dr Subhash Prasad, 50, and his
wife Pratima, claim that social work staff have harassed them and
engaged in racial discrimination.
However, in a report to councillors, district social work manager, Mr
George Irving, states: ''I most strongly refute this allegation. The
proprietors have produced no evidence whatever to substantiate this
allegation.'' One of the social workers is a regional staff anti-racism
trainer.
Dr Prasad, a general practitioner, who retired early due to ill
health, has advised The Herald he will not be appealing the region's
decision to cancel the registration of Braeside, Irvine Road, Largs, and
has in fact returned his current certificate to the council.
He and his wife have been running the home since October 1, 1992. At
present, the home has three residents, one of whom is in hospital. Its
capacity is 14 residents but for the past two years there have been no
referrals from social work.
From January 6 until May 6 this year, when the home was being closely
monitored for the implementation of conditions imposed by social work, a
total of 28 visits were made to it by social work staff.
Dr Prasad said: ''We did our best to meet all the requirements but the
Social Work Department in Irvine was dissatisfied for some reason I
don't know about. We have fulfilled all that we were asked to do.
''The main thing they (social workers) were saying was we should
appoint a manager. We've had four or five managers.
''They also picked me up on a minor thing that I didn't have contracts
with the staff.''
Dr Prasad added: ''It was too much hassle for me to run the home and
cope with what has happened in recent months. So I'm not intending to go
for an appeal. I've no option but to close the home.
''I feel some kind of discrimination has been working here by the
Social Work Department against me -- racial discrimination,'' he
claimed.
However, a social work report on the home paints a picture of
administrative chaos. Since the original manager left in May 1993, the
department had received nine applications for notification for change of
manager. The high turnover of proposed managers was not regarded as
conducive to the efficient and effect operational management at the
home.
During that 17-week period when social work conditions were being
imposed, a proposed manager, in the absence of a cook, took
responsibility for providing residents' meals, but this meant she was
unable to undertake other tasks normally expected of the manager.
Care staff were noted to be working excessive hours. During the week
commencing February 27, one member of staff was rostered to be on duty
at Braeside for a total of 112 hours in addition to working a reported
18 hours in another establishment.
During the 17-week period, there had been a total of 10 changes of
staff members. A further eight changes had taken place during the
following six weeks.
Strathclyde region has previously cancelled the registrations of
residential homes in Glasgow, Uplawmoor, and Port Glasgow. It is
understood a number of other homes are under investigation.

STRACHAN &amp; Henshaw, which is part of Glasgow-based Weir Group, has
successfully diversified into the aerospace industry with a #5m-plus
contract for airport cargo-handling systems.
The Bristol-based operation, the third-largest company within Weir
Group, has traditionally supplied mechanical-handling equipment to the
nuclear power and defence sectors.
However, with defence work dwindling, Strachan &amp; Henshaw has been
pushing into other markets.
Although the latest contract was let by the Ministry of Defence, and
relates to cargo-handling systems for Royal Air Force transport bases,
it is essentially for aerospace work and is the first major deal which
Strachan &amp; Henshaw has secured in this field.

LLOYDS Bank yesterday handed over #1800m to its new subsidiary,
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, for onward transmission to C&amp;G members eligible
to share in the payout, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Amounts ranging from #513 to #13,700 will be paid over on or before
August 10. All qualifying accountholders will have their payout credited
directly to their accounts, except for holders of Tessas and permanent
interest bearing shares who will receive cheques. Direct transfer into
Tessa accounts could breach their limits.
The windfalls will be treated as capital gain for tax purposes and
given the #6000 annual exemption (#12,000 for couples) this will only
concern larger accountholders. Payments are based on #500 plus 13.2% of
the balance up to a maximum account size of #100,000.
Statements will be issued to accountholders in the middle of the month
confirming the amount of payment made.
As an incentive to savers to keep their windfall in their accounts,
C&amp;G has raised interest rates on its full range of investment accounts
by 0.2%. Its London Account now pays 5.95% gross on a minimum investment
of #2500. The #1000-#10,000 tier in the Cheltenham Gold account pays
2.85%. Accountholders can now do what they like with their money without
risking losing their payout.
Many savers are casting around for the next building society to be
taken over or go public and there has been a rush of applications to
open accounts, often with just #100 in each. Nationwide is reckoned to
be one of likeliest bets to convert into a public company, with Woolwich
and Alliance &amp; Leicester as other larger societies worth a flutter. But
it is a smaller society, Yorkshire, which presents the scope for the
biggest gain as its potential payout is put at some #1100 per
accountholder.
Meanwhile the other great building society merger, Halifax and Leeds
Permanent, also became effective yesterday and the integration process
is now underway, with 39 Leeds and three Halifax branches transferring
to other locations.
Members of the enlarged society will get their reward but they will
have to be patient and maintain their balances in the meantime. It will
come in the form of free shares when the society floats on the stock
market in around two years time.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
DIPLOMATS warned today that the conflict in Bosnia appeared on the
verge of blowing up into a full-scale war in the region and leaders of
the United Nations and Serbia appealed for peace.
As rebel Serb jets bombed Croat forces near the Bosnian border,
Croatia and Bosnia turned down a proposed diplomatic deal to ease
sanctions against Belgrade in return for recognition of Bosnia,
describing it as an unacceptable change in Western policy.
The proposed deal, which has divided the Contact Group of major
powers, resulted from talks between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
and European Union mediator Carl Bildt in Belgrade on July 19.
Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic and his Bosnian counterpart
Muhamed Sacirbey said the proposals did not include mutual recognition
between Bosnia, Croatia, and rump Yugoslavia.
Instead they offered ''at best a mirage recognition of some
Bosnia-Herzegovina only as defined by Mr Milosevic and the authorities
of the Belgrade regime, which is unacceptable to our governments''.
The Contact Group is due to meet tomorrow in Washington to discuss the
draft deal. However the United States and Germany are at odds with
Britain, Russia, and France over the proposal.
US officials said they opposed rewarding Serbia at a time when Bosnian
Serbs appeared unwilling to compromise.
London, Moscow, and Paris argue that time is running out after three
years of war and that the only alternative to a deal with Serbia now may
be effectively to drop the Contact Group peace plan and have the parties
negotiate directly.
Meanwhile, the Croatian Serb air raid on Croatian positions on the
outskirts of Strmica followed a Croatian advance in south-west Bosnia
that cut a vital supply route linking the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin
with Serb-held territory in Bosnia, easing pressure on the Muslim
enclave of Bihac to the north.
After capturing Grahovo and Glamoc on Friday, Croats have begun
shelling Strmica, threatening the Serb stronghold of Knin.
Rebel Serb forces today shelled the Gospic and Otocac areas in
Croatian Government territory close to UN truce lines, Croatian media
reported.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Croatian Serb leader Milan
Martic issued an appeal to Belgrade to help them counter the growing
Croat threat in western Bosnia.
''Serb people in both states are fighting with their hands tied and
urgently need help from Serbia and Yugoslavia,'' they told reporters.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, saying war in Croatia
appeared imminent, urgently appealed to both sides to ''stop and reflect
about the choice which now faces them''.
''The reports reaching me indicate that war between them is imminent.
If it happens, it will again cause terrible casualties and material
damage on a vast scale,'' he said.
''War is not inevitable; nor will it settle the conflict. Only
negotiation will do that,'' he added.
His fears were echoed by UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi, who said:
''The danger of full-scale war is increasing.''
Milosevic called on Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian
Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic to end hostilities and work for
peace now.
''Peace is unavoidable. It would be better it happened before
countless more people on both sides lose their lives or bear the brunt
of war suffering, before the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina destroy each
other,'' he said.
International mediators announced that envoys from the Croatian
Government and rebel Krajina Serbs had agreed to meet in Geneva for
peace talks on Thursday, but events on the ground threatened to scuttle
the talks.
In Bosnia, government soldiers and Bosnian Serbs both blocked the
passage of aid convoys into Sarajevo, UN relief officials said.--Reuter.

INTEREST rates in Britain may not have to rise immediately to ensure
the government meets its inflation target, an economist from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said.
However, in a report published yesterday, the Paris-based think-tank
sees short-term interest rates rising later in the year to peak at
7.75%, if the Government is serious about keeping inflation in its 1% to
4% target band.
''At the moment . . . monetary policy is sufficently tight to achieve
a soft landing,'' OECD economist James Chan-Lee told Reuter Financial
Television in an interview. UK base rates are currently 6.75%.
Chan-Lee said monetary policy, which has been tightened three times
since September 1994, was very close to a neutral stance.
In its report, the OECD said Britain's new monetary policy framework,
notably the publication of the minutes of a monthly meeting between the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England, had
strengthened the central bank's role.
''The positive experience with the current framework so far suggests
that it can deliver the inflation objective,'' the OECD said. It said
that inflation target should be updated.
''The mid-point of the range should be lowered below its current 2.5%
to build credibility,'' the OECD said, suggesting a medium-term target
below 2%.
Giving the Bank of England responsibility for the timing and size of
rate moves might further enhance credibility, the OECD said.
Further increases in rates may be necessary in 1995 as GDP growth is
still above the longer-term sustainable level, the OECD said. GDP growth
is projected to fall to 3.4% in 1995 and 3% in 1996.
Economists noted the OECD is using official figures available up to
May 7, since when the slowdown in growth has become more pronounced.
''By end-1996 the UK economy could be experiencing the favourable
situation of GDP growth slowing to a more sustainable rate, unemployment
falling to close to its estimated natural rate, with inflation still
moderate and the current account near balance,'' the OECD said. --

COWIE, the motor distribution, finance and bus group, has reported a
better than expected 32% increase in profits from #20.5m to #27.1m
before tax in the half-year to June 30 on a 7[1/2]% improvement in
turnover to #529m, writes CHRIS STONE.
It is boosting its interim dividend 12% to 3.05p on earnings per
share, 19% ahead at 12.3p. This kind of progress went down well in the
market, where Cowie's shares closed 5p higher at 307p, having touched
312p at one stage. In pre-market dealings they were among the 10 most
actively traded shares.
A profit split shows that motor finance profits rose 19% to #16.2m and
motor dealerships by the same amount to #6.4m. London acquisitions
boosted the bus operation to #3.9m before exceptional items, while bus
and coach distribution advanced 10% to #1.6m.
Chief executive Gordon Hodgson commented: ''The quality of our unique
spread of business operations, together with a proven strategy for
growth and our record of acquisitions, provides a substantial,
sustainable and secure long -term future income for the group, and
continues to set us apart from the rest in the sector.''
Cowie Interleasing benefited from the healthy margins now available on
the sale of ex contract hire cars, and has developed a number of more
profitable avenues for their disposal into the market. The group says
its national vehicle refurbishment centre is working 20 hours out of 24
to process up to 1000 ex-company cars a month to meet demand.
Improved efficiency at existing motor dealerships, supported by new
marketing initiatives, provided the impetus for the upturn in profits in
this division.
The acquisition of Leaside Buses and South London Transport added to
Cowie's established Grey-Green bus company helping to lift profits to
#3.9m before redundancy costs, against #863,000 last time.
After the half-timer, analysts may nudge their full year profit
estimates for Cowie a little higher. The consensus prior to the results
was for #53m before tax.

THE head of Scotland's biggest business organisation last night called
for Prime Minister John Major to give leaders of industry a seat in
Government to determine how the Exchequer spends #30bn of business rates
and corporation tax every year.
Charles Winter, director-general of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce,
which represents 8000 business people, called for an end to what he
describes as the Government's ''taxation without representation'' of the
business sector.
Mr Winter's call follows the publication of a specialist paper by
Professor Bob Bennett of the London School of Economics, which reveals
that British business contributes #14bn per annum to the Exchequer in
the form of rates and #16bn in corporation tax.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke promised to consider the director-general's
demands ''very carefully'' before he announces the next Budget in
November.
Mr Winter, whose members provide 50% of all private sector jobs in
Scotland, yesterday said it was the failure of the British Government to
heed the slogan ''taxation without representation is tyranny'' which
cost us the American colonies.
''Today, as a #30bn taxpayer, British business must have a say in how
its contributions to the Exchequer are spent,'' he said.
He is concerned that although British business provides a massive
contribution to the Exchequer, it has no direct possibility of
influencing the quantum of the tax or the manner in which it is spent.
He maintains that the problem has been exacerbated by the introduction
of a Uniform Business Rate in Scotland -- moving control from local
authorities to central government.
Mr Winter, the former group chief executive of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, added: ''It was the case in the past that business could
always point out to a particularly grasping local authority that, if its
demands became too intolerable, the business base would simply move
elsewhere,'' he observed.
''The cost of uniformity has been the loss of that sanction. The
business sector now faces a bill for rates and corporation tax alone of
#30bn and no vote on the way in which these revenues should be spent.''
However, he dismissed a return to local authority control of business
rates as ''retrograde'' and called on the Chancellor to earmark revenue
from industry for redeployment into private sector business for
promoting ''greater economic growth'' in the geographical area of its
operation.
''In doing so, this would create the ''sharing of sovereignty between
politicians and citizens which we are assured is so desirable,'' he
added.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke last night promised to ''consider very
carefully'' Mr Winter's representations, along with certain others,
before November's Budget.
''During recent Budgets the Government has announced various measures
to especially help small business,'' he said.
''The Treasury is already looking at certain hypothetical taxes and
the difficulties they may bring, and is considering a range of measures.
''Mr Winter's suggestions will be taken on board and considered very
carefully before the next Budget.''

THE owner of an old folk's home at the centre of ill-treatment
allegations has given up her legal battle against Borders Regional
Council.
Mrs Elaine Adamson claims she can no longer afford to go on with an
appeal against the council's decision to deregister Woodside Home in
Newcastleton, and the home will now close.
The first day of an appeal tribunal at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on
Monday heard that the council had received complaints about the way
residents were treated.
Mr Peter Snelling, 37, a council inspector, said one resident was
concerned about the way another, who died recently, had been treated. He
also found evidence that girls as young as 12 were working at the home.
At the end of an initial visit in 1992, Mr Snelling concluded that the
home, run by Mrs Adamson, 54, since 1987, did provide a caring
environment.
However, when Mrs Adamson applied to increase the number of residents,
she stated she was a state-enrolled nurse. However, her name was not on
any professional register.
Yesterday, after an unsuccessful bid to settle the case, Mrs Adamson's
counsel told the tribunal that the appeal was being abandoned due to
financial constraints.
Outside the court, solicitor Robert Millar pointed out that Mrs
Adamson was not eligible for legal aid and had to fund the appeal
privately.
Mr Colin Johnson, Borders director of social work, said the council
would make a full statement today.

Clare Henry speaks to radical artist Marina Abramovic about her
25-year retrospective and finds the exhibitionist, famous for
self-imposed life-threatening acts, has gone solo and come full circle
Ideas don't come in a studio, but while you're chopping garlic or
going to the airport
EXHIBITIONIST? Spiritualist? Radical conceptualist? Glamour Girl?
Certainly the world's most famous female performer. The last time I saw
Marina Abramovic she had three live pythons slithering around her head
for two hours: a piece called Dragon. Our first meeting was more
relaxed, in her house in Amsterdam after her return from a 2000km,
three-month walk on the Great Wall of China, perhaps the longest, most
arduous twentieth-century performance piece ever.
Since then she has cut a star in her stomach with a razor blade,
burned her hair, screamed into the wind till she lost her voice (it
takes two hours), and hung suspended semi-naked centre stage above a
pile of bones and dogs while holding two snakes. Now in Edinburgh I'm
greeted with a barrage of ear-splitting machine-gun fire.
Nothing personal, you understand; just a rerun of her most radical,
dramatic 1972 sound-piece, part of her 25-year retrospective at the
Fruitmarket Gallery which includes new videos (of skeletons), God
Punishing, (five whips made from the hair of Korean virgins) as well as
a giant seven-metre-high steel chair on top of the Fruitmarket roof.
Abramovich stops at nothing. ''Pushing my body to its physical and
mental limits'' is her credo.
She's more beautiful than ever, exuding energy, commitment and charm.
She is also a workaholic and perfectionist, one reason why her new life
as a solo artist after 12 years as a duo, is so successful. Every man in
sight lights up in her presence. How does she look this good when she's
50 next year? For more than 30 years Abramovic has been extraordinary.
Right from the start she worked on the edge, her background in Tito's
post-war Belgrade (mother a major, father a communist general,
grandfather an orthodox priest, now proclaimed a saint) supplying the
right mix of drama. Her earliest memory is of her father and a pistol.
He liked danger. At 15 her parents divorced and he taught her how to
shoot. She reacted to family disputes and a restrictive political
climate by creating scandalous public ceremonies and performances of her
own.
By 1968 Abramovic was active in student opposition -- and was proud
when her father took to the podium in their support and tore up his
party card.
Her early work, along with the war gunfire piece, included projected
images where more and more of this Yugoslav city's buildings were
removed, ''just like bombing,'' she says. ''Artists are strangely
visionary.''
In 1973 a man arrived in Belgrade who was to ''prove incredibly
important in my life''. Richard Demarco, on one of his customary
journeys to Eastern Europe, was in town searching for artists to appear
at the Edinburgh Festival. He was an official guest of the Yugoslav
Government, and had spent a week seeing official artists from their
list. He was umimpressed.
On his final night he was recommended to see Abramovic and her five
avant garde friends.
''He came early next morning, saw the work and invited us all to
Edinburgh. Our Government refused to let us go. They said we were not
the kind of people to represent the country. We phoned Ricky. He said to
get a cheap flight; he would look after things.
''And he did. I'd never been out of Yugoslavia before. The six of us
-- I was the only woman -- stayed in Edinburgh for six months. We met
Joseph Beuys and Kantor. We didn't know people like that existed. We
discovered our art family. A complete world opened up to us. I'll never
forget his help.''
In Edinburgh she ventured into violent performance territory, stabbing
a sharp knife between her spread fingers: over and over, faster and
faster to a rhythmic beat ignoring the cuts and gashes.
In 1975 she met another man who was to change her life, her partner
for 12 years, the German artist Ulay. ''We met in Amsterdam, fell in
love. I left Yugoslavia for ever. For four years we lived a totally
nomadic life in a Citroen van, living off the land, in woods, up hills,
milking goats. It was tough -- but the happiest time of my life.''
Together this charismatic pair enacted their love affair in public.
Both were fascinated by Eastern philosophies like Buddhism and how
ritual led to a heightened state of awareness. Their collaborative
performances were extreme, loaded with risks and aggression, and often
scared audiences.
Abramovic frequently performed nude and would beat herself till she
bled or exert herself till she fainted. Once they sat back-to-back for
16 hours tied together by their long hair or slapped each other hard
across the face till one gave in.
Then they spent nine months in the Australian desert travelling along
ancient song lines. The power play reached explosive levels with a
life-threatening bow-and-arrow performance.
Inevitably, their all-consuming passion ended turbulently. The lovers'
arduous three-month walk along the great Wall of China from opposite
ends, 15 hours a day up remote mountains, should have ended in a
marriage ceremony. Instead they split up.
''I was 42 and I was zero. I felt like half a person. For six years
after he never spoke to me. How could he do that; be that kind of man?
Love is truely blind! I had overcome physical pain but mental, emotional
pain can be greater.''
Back in Amsterdam alone she bought a house, ''but I was in panic. I'd
lost my work and my career too. I had to completely rebuild my world --
and a whole new system of art''.
And so to minerals and crystals. Her experience walking the wall told
her she felt differently on clay, on rock or quartz. ''I began making
quartz objects working with the three basic positions of the body:
sitting, standing, and lying.'' It's normally taboo to touch sculpture.
Abramovic reversed the situation and made it essential for the public to
interact with her works.
Many of these crystal pieces are in Edinburgh. She goes to Brazil to
find the 2500kg chunks of quartz: up the Amazon, down mines, ''to the
ends of the bloody world! The miners think I'm mad. I sit for days in
the mines waiting for ideas. Ideas don't come in a studio, but while
you're chopping garlic or on the way to the airport.''
The shoes are a paradox: too heavy to walk in or even move. ''It's a
metaphorical journey I ask. Put your bare feet in, close your eyes and
depart. Your soul is moving, not you.''
It seems much of her life was preordained. Her grandfather the
Patriach, was poisoned in 1938 by crushed diamonds secretly put in his
food. ''You see, crystals were in my family even then!''
She has a busy six months ahead, with shows in Brittany, Santa Fe,
Dublin, New York, Lyon and Paris, and she would like to perform at
Glasgow's Tramway. But her longing for a nomadic life is over. ''Always
departures! Now I like my house. I've just spent four years in Berlin,
but I plan to settle in Amsterdam.''
Now professor of art at Hamburg and Paris, to her surprise she loves
teaching. ''I believe at a certain age, it's an artist's duty to
transmit what they've experienced. Happily, artists have a passion to
serve society!''
Her student workshops emphasise touch and feeling, by not eating, not
talking, walking long distances blindfold. ''Not all art is visual. We
ignore our sensibilities at our peril. Artists have to be trained to
'see' with the entire body.''
Returning to Edinburgh after 22 years is, she feels, coming full
circle. ''This retrospective demonstrates that everything I've done is
connected. Artists work on impulse. They often don't know why at the
time. It's good for the public to have an overview -- but I need that
too. It proves the point that the most important thing is the idea, it
just takes different forms.''
As I was leaving she grabbed my arm. ''You will mention Ricky Demarco
won't you? That man is SUCH a pioneer. He deserves better recognition.''
* Marina Abramovic is the Festival exhibition at Edinburgh's
Fruitmarket until September 9. The Channel 4 film, Lovers at The Brink,
on her Wall of China walk is at the Filmhouse on August 17 as a tribute
to Barbara Grigor.

FIVE men who died in a speedboat accident in Northern Ireland spent
#200 on spirits before they drowned, an inquest was told yesterday.
Mr Stephen Martin, 32, the sole survivor of the accident on Strangford
Lough, told the hearing he and his friends had turned down the offer of
a taxi home only minutes before setting off on the fatal journey.
The party had ordered a mixture of whisky, Bloody Marys, Black
Russians, and one cocktail called an Asylum, which contained vodka,
Pernod, and Cointreau, at Daft Eddy's pub on Sketrick Island on the
lough on the day of the accident, last December.
The inquest heard the men then went on to another bar on the island,
the Lightship, where they ordered another round of whiskies.
As they left the Lightship to return to Kircubbin on the other side of
the lough, the speedboat's engine failed. As Mr Martin tried to start
the motor, the boat capsized and started to sink.
Mr Martin was rescued after swimming more than a mile in pitch
darkness to nearby Trasna Island.
He joined hundreds of volunteers to scour the lough for his friends,
but in vain.
The disaster, on December 27 last year, plunged the tight-knit
Kircubbin community into mourning. Three of of those who died were from
the village -- Christopher Bell, 33, of Manse Road, Glastry, Hugh
McCullough, 30, of Rubane Road, and Jackie McNamara, 36, of Shore Road.
The other victims -- Ron Grant, 54, of School Lane, North
Cockerington, Lincolnshire., and George Sweeney, 39, of Ribblesdale
Avenue, Northolt, Middlesex, had family ties with the area.
Mr Jim Lee, an inspector with the Maritime Accident Investigation
Branch in Southampton, said two 18mm holes drilled in the side of the
boat would have allowed water to get into the hull.
Tests carried out after the craft was recovered from the lough showed
that, with six adults on board, one of the holes would have been well
below the waterline, he said.
The outboard motor was more powerful than the maximum recommended by
the boat's manufacturer and the boat had no navigation aids, VHF radio,
flotation equipment or anchor.
Recording a verdict of death by drowning, Coroner John Leckey said:
''This tragedy shows that alcohol and sailing can be a fatal
combination.''

PRISON officers' leaders have reacted angrily to the latest Scottish
Prison Service moves towards the creation of privately funded, built,
and run jails, claiming the figures are being manipulated to prop up the
SPS case.
The chairman of the Scottish Prison Officers' Association, Mr Eddie
Hunter, of Shotts Prison, said: ''I am not saying we cannot use more
space but, if the refurbishment programme for existing accommodation
went ahead as quickly as possible, the facts would not possibly justify
the building of a private prison.''
Mr Hunter claimed the SPS figures showed the prisoner places available
in cells and dormitories was not 5200 as the agency had stated but 5478.
He was also critical of SPS figures released on Monday, when they
announced the appointment of consultants to explore possible private
prison sites.
''It appears to us that they are clearly manipulating the capacity
figures and the projections to bolster the case for a private prison,''
he said.
Mr John Gerrie, the SPS spokesman, said the latest figures taken 10
days ago showed a usable capacity of 5187 spaces in the Scottish system
which was housing 5626 prisoners.

Lahore, Tuesday
SECURITY guards punched photographers at a dinner hosted by Pakistani
cricketer Imran Khan last night to celebrate his recent marriage to
British heiress Jemima Goldsmith, witnesses claimed.
Several cameramen working for local and foreign news organisations
said they were manhandled and had their equipment damaged by the private
guards who pushed them out of the banquet hall.
No comment on the incident was immediately available from Imran or his
family.
The family had not invited press photographers to the dinner at an
army mess in Lahore's garrison area. However, between 50 and 60
photographers and television crew had waited outside for an opportunity
to take shots of Imran and his wife.
They entered the mess in a rush, breaking glass of a door when the
guards opened the gate leading to the banquet hall towards the last
stages of the dinner, witnesses said.
The confusion infuriated the other guards inside and some organisers
who started pushing the camerman back, according to the witnesses. In
the process, several cameramen were apparently slapped or punched and
their equipment damaged.
The witnesses said between 700 and 800 guests attended what Imran had
promised to be an austere one-dish dinner as a break from traditional
lavish celebration dinners.--Reuter.

A SOLICITOR told a court yesterday that he ran for his life after
being trapped in a flat by a threatening, abusive man.
Mr Nigel Beaumont, one of Edinburgh's leading defence lawyers, told
the city's sheriff court he had gone to the flat in Magdalene Drive,
Edinburgh, to interview a female prosecution witness in a forthcoming
trial.
Another witness in the case, Mr Robert King, found out that he was
there and confronted him about the way he was going to present the case,
shouting and screaming at him.
Mr King, 42, of Magdalene Medway, and Mr Kevin Bruce, 31, of Dalkeith
Road, both Edinburgh, deny assaulting Mr Beaumont on June 13 and
threatening to kill him.
They also deny preventing Mr Beaumont from leaving the house,
breaching the peace, and attempting to pervert the course of justice by
trying to intimidate him.
Mr Beaumont said Mr King and Mr Bruce came into the flat and Mr King
demanded that Mr Beaumont go into the stairway to fight him. ''The
general drift of it was that he was going to give me a kicking,'' said
Mr Beaumont.
Asked by depute procurator-fiscal David Dickson if he was concerned,
Mr Beaumont replied: ''I was more than concerned, I was terrified.''
Mr Beaumont said he eventually made a dash for it when the woman
witness he had gone to see knocked Mr King over in a struggle. ''I
grabbed my bag and ran for my life,'' he said.
The trial, before Sheriff Isobel Poole, continues.

Youth calls the tune this month with a breathtaking array of music
that professional organisations wouldn't have the nerve to touch, writes
Michael Tumelty
WERE it not for the looming juggernaut of the Edinburgh International
Festival, Scotland's musical map throughout August would be dominated by
youth.
Three huge youth festivals, in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, will
put on display the best of British and foreign young musicians --
literally, by the thousand. The festivals will also display a level of
uninhibited and adventurous programming that adult, professional
organisations would not dare risk in the climate of fear that
characterises the need to strike a middle ground and maximise box-office
takings.
First out of the blocks is the Aberdeen International Youth Festival,
which is launched this morning with a parade along Union Street to the
Music Hall, normally the musical nerve-centre of operations of the
festival (although this year's event features a special initiative).
The Aberdeen festival is not exclusively classical music, featuring a
theatre company from Zimbabwe, and a host of dance companies -- ballet,
contemporary dance, and folk ensembles -- from Azerbaijan, Prague,
Hungary, and St Petersburg, as well as the Wigan Youth Jazz Orchestra
(winners of the 1994 BBC Radio 2 Big Band Competition).
But the core of the festival is undoubtedly its orchestral music
programme, launched in grand style tonight by Scotland's finest -- the
superb National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, at the climax of their own
current Scottish tour, in a programme featuring Dave Heath's new
concerto for Evelyn Glennie. They will be followed over the next 10 days
by orchestras from the Netherlands, Ireland, and Scotland, and choirs
from Gomel, the Ukraine, Norway, and the Czech republic.
Within that musical core, however, this year there is a special
strand. The festival will link up with Aberdeen University, which is
currently celebrating its quincentenary. Six special musical events will
be staged in the Mitchell Hall of Marischal College, and threaded
through these will be a focus on Scottish composers.
That begins tomorrow when the Netherlands Youth String Orchestra
perform a fanfare commissioned from Aberdeen composer Kevin Haggart, and
Michael Norris's Waltz for Strings. Other Scottish music featuring in
the festival includes Edward Harper's Fiddler of the Reels and Thomas
Wilson's thoroughgoing masterpiece, the St Kentigern Suite (one of the
few Scottish works to have been taken into the repertoire of all of the
country's professional orchestras).
Glasgow's Edward McGuire is virtually a featured composer of the
Aberdeen festival. His Symphonies of Trains will be played by the Kelvin
Ensemble from Glasgow University, the Camerata Scotland (aka the elite
chamber orchestra of the National Youth Orchestra) will perform his
Fiddler's Farewell, while the Irish Youth Wind Ensemble tackle his
Sirocco.
And there will be more. As a commitment to the nation's music, this
Aberdeen festival stands like a beacon.
Down the road apiece, flexing its muscles and about to launch next
weekend, is the extraordinary Festival of British Youth Orchestras, two
festivals in one, which will run concurrently in Edinburgh and Glasgow
through to the beginning of September.
Extraordinary? In scale, just that. Beginning next Saturday and
running through the following three weeks, the two festivals will
feature symphony, woodwind, and string orchestras from the Highland,
Central, Borders, Fife, Lothian, and Strathclyde regions; from the
cities of Dundee, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Perth; and, from outside
Scotland, orchestras from Southampton, Dorset, West Glamorgan, Ulster,
Bedfordshire, Durham, and Sheffield. And there will be foreign guests
from the Netherlands and Sweden.
In total there will be 50 concerts featuring 2000 young musicians
ranging in age from the seven and eight-year-old tots of Ronnie Walker's
splendid Dunbartonshire Primary Schools Orchestra to the young adults of
the student-run Southhampton University Symphony Orchestra.
In repertoire terms, this lot are completely unrestrained and off the
leash. Sure, there are the Tchaikovsky, Brahms and Rachmaninov
symphonies that you might expect (though not necessarily from
youngsters), but there is also a breathtaking array of music that pro
organisations wouldn't have the nerve to touch -- the old box-office
neurosis again.
When, for example, was the last time you heard Franz Berwald's
Symphonie Singuliere, Gottfried von Einem's Philadelphia Symphony,
Rimsky-Korsakov's Trombone Concerto, Morton Feldman's Intersection for
Orchestra, or Edward Gregson's Tuba Concerto? See what I mean?
And there is a host of contemporary music too, including four new
pieces -- commissions -- from Philip Flood, Russell Keable, Kenneth
Dempster and Geoffrey King. Recent music from American whizz-kid Michael
Torke will be featured, alongside music by Scotland's John Maxwell
Geddes, Neil Butterworth, Thomas Wilson (the brilliant St Kentigern
Suite again) and Edward McGuire (his Symphonies of Trains).
A dazzling display, running (for the 16th year in Edinburgh) at the
Central Hall, Tollcross, and (for the eighth year in Glasgow) in the
Stevenson Hall of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.

WILLIAM RUSSELL previews a stylish film about an artist starving in
Glasgow
FRANZ Kafka worked wonders for Peter Capaldi. The question is: can
Franz do the same for another Glasgow film maker, Bernard Rudden, and
for Jim Hickey's Edinburgh-based production company, Boxcar?
Rudden's film, Hunger Artist, a 42-minute short, Boxcar's first
production, is based on a Kafka short story reset in present-day
Glasgow. Filmed in black and white, it is a calling card for both
director and producer, and gets its first screenings at the Edinburgh
Film Festival.
Capaldi's short film, also shown at Edinburgh, went on to win an Oscar
and secured him a feature-film contract with Miramax. Boxcar's first
feature film, if all goes well, will be Shadow Boxing, which Rudden has
written and will direct. Most of the money is in place, and the plan is
to start filming later this year, but it will help greatly if Hunger
Artist is well received.
It deserves to be, because Rudden has made a stylish film which
exploits its Glasgow locations to the full, creating a world that is
familiar but somehow out of kilter. This feeling of alienation fits the
story perfectly, and the black and white photography is of a high order.
Short films are notoriously neither fish nor fowl, and this one, at 42
minutes, is an awkward length from an exhibitor's point of view,
although it is exactly the right length for the story, not something one
can say about too many movies.
Everything has been pared down to the bone.
The Artist, played by the Glasgow disc jockey Flash, is a young man
who exhibits himself in freak shows, circuses and zoos, whose sales
pitch is that he is starving himself to death. His story is told by a
journalist, the Dutch actress, Antoinette Van Belle, who is looking for
him after he has been kidnapped by a profiteer, Mark O'Dowd. She is
hoping to discover before he dies what his motives are for such
behaviour.
Rudden said he had only taken the basic premise of the Kafka story and
transferred it into the 1990s, and a media dominated environment.
''I read the story 10 years ago and it haunted me. I thought then that
one day I could turn it into a film. When I missed out on the BFI
financing one of the two producers, Mark O'Dowd, said 'Why not just make
something you like?' I met Flash in a cafe one day and he was perfect
for the Artist -- he comes from a family who partook of fasting for
religious reasons and went on a strict diet for 10 weeks beforehand and
continued it while we shot the film -- and I met Antoinette in Amsterdam
when I was working there, and she agreed to do it.
''We shot it in winter light in Glasgow between 10am and 3pm, starting
last December.
''The question posed is, whether the Artist is right to do what he
does? Is there some kind of purpose and integrity to his life which the
advertising men, the pop star, and the promoter he meets don't have? I
wanted to measure his life against our media-dominated society in which
people are treated as commodities. The number of interpretations people
have put on his actions -- is he a holy fool, a fool -- are very varied.
Hunger is his way of living. I have no specific meaning for it. I
allowed him to be what he is.''
The money was raised, partly from family and friends, partly through
Boxcar, and the result is an admirable calling card. But it is more. It
is also a very good short film by any standards, among the best I have
seen this year.

BRITISH Design and Art Direction is currently hosting its third
Festival of Excellence at the Saatchi Gallery -- this year dedicated to
the best of British and international advertising and design. This is
the first large-scale exhibition of contemporary commercial art held in
the UK and is provocatively entitled The Cream of British Advertising in
a punning reference to a highly successful beer promotion campaign.
The title helps to pinpoint the strength of British advertising,
depending increasingly on the collusion of a sophisticated public
well-versed in the culture of advertising, but who also have a passing
knowledge of high art practice (or at least one created in media, and
particularly the tabloid press). The witty advertisement for the show
itself has a fish tank full of creamy beer with a thick Boddington's
head on it, but the allusion is to Damien Hirst's notorious dead sheep.
The caption across the tank reads: ''In this instance the lamp got the
chop''.
The exhibition presents a sleek, expensive corporate image in the
great white spaces of the Saatchi gallery, itself a homage to the wealth
of the 1980s created by advertising. The show is multimedia,
incorporating billboards, newspaper advertisments, and little theatres
dedicated to cinema advertisements.
One of the most effective sections is dedicated to advertisements for
charities and pressure groups, acknowledging that the big bucks are not
simply in the alcoholic drinks market (or that even the advertising
industry has a conscience). The splendidly perky dog in the National
Canine Defence League's Toy's Aren't Us (a dog is for life not just for
Christmas) is unintentionally self-defeating. Some are more disturbing
-- the Commission for Racial Equality and Amnesty International both go
all out to shock.
Advertisers are now only too aware that their audience can suffer from
compassion fatigue after watching the horrors of the television news and
have stepped up their campaigns accordingly. That is just another
powerful example of the way in which design and advertising intersect
with every aspect of our daily lives, and one that is made startlingly
clear in this fascinating show.

Los Angeles, Tuesday
LORD White of Hull, a co-founder of the business conglomerate Hanson,
was tonight fighting for his life in hospital.
The 72-year-old Yorkshire-born financier was taken ill at the weekend,
when he developed breathing difficulties as he flew home to Los Angeles
following a holiday in London with his American-born wife Victoria.
Lady White, 32, the former model he married in 1992, was thought to be
at his bedside in the UCLA hospital together with his daughters from the
first of his three marriages, Caroline and Sita.
A spokesman for the hospital described his condition in intensive care
as ''serious, but stable at this point''.
The peer is understood to have suffered lung problems for some time,
which worsened as he returned to his #4m Bel Air mansion in his private
jet.
He was taken to hospital as the company he helped to found finalised
negotiations for Monday's agreed #2500mn bid for Britain's largest
regional electricity group, Eastern.
With fellow Yorkshireman James Hanson, Lord White built up the #12
billion conglomerate Hanson into a major business force in Britain and
the US. His personal fortune is estimated between #70m and #100m. He was
knighted by Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and then made a life peer four
years ago.

An appeal to motorists not to make unnecessary journeys in the hot
weather received a guarded welcome, with motoring and environment groups
calling for positive action to improve public transport.
THE Government yesterday urged motorists to think twice before using
their cars as air pollution levels soared in sweltering temperatures.
Environment minister Robert Jones issued the plea as forecasters
predicted the hot spell, which sent July into the record books, would
continue for the rest of the week. Temperatures in parts of the South
yesterday reached 34C (93F).
Motorists could help improve air quality if they took the Government's
advice and left their cars at home when possible on days when quality
was poor, Mr Jones told BBC Radio.
The last time the Government made such an appeal some 10% of motorists
stopped using their cars, which had a significant impact on air quality,
he said.
''We want to get over the message that when air quality is poor people
should think twice about whether they really need to use their cars.''
The Department made its appeal to motorists after forecasts of poor
air quality in central and southern England and London. It issued a
leaflet giving drivers a series of dos and don'ts when air quality is
poor.
* Don't use a car if it does not have a catalytic converter (it is
unlikely to have one if it is an L-reg or earlier)
* Don't use a car for short journeys (1.5 miles or less), even if it
has a converter.
* If car use is unavoidable, don't warm the engine or use the choke
more than necessary
* Don't leave the engine idling. If you expect to be stuck in a
traffic jam for more than a couple of minutes, switch off your engine
* Park in the shade to avoid fuel evaporating from your car in the
sun.
Motorists were being targeted because cars were the main source of
gases which led to the creation of summertime smog in very hot weather,
the Government said.
The leaflet was being distributed widely, with copies going to every
GP's surgery in England and Wales, said a spokesman.
The AA welcomed the DoE move, but said a longer-term approach was
needed if summer pollution problems were to be avoided in future.
''We are all for people considering other ways of getting around,''
said a spokeswoman.
''Short journeys could be made on foot or bicycle, and where possible
we are all for car-sharing and using public transport where necessary.
''But this is a year-round problem that is just worse in the summer.
The most important point is that people should remember the need to
reduce pollution after the hot weather has ended.''
An RAC spokesman said: ''There is absolutely no point in asking
motorists to leave their cars at home in hot weather if the alternative
transport isn't there.
''This just highlights the lack of a strategic transport policy in
this country.''
Greenpeace said: ''We obviously go along with any reduction in car
usage and hope that motorists heed the message.
''But if the Government was serious about it, they would be putting
money into public transport so that this pollution problem doesn't
happen in future.''
The Department's appeal to motorists came less than two weeks after
the new Environment Act gave local councils duties to carry out surveys
on pollution hot spots and prepare anti-pollution plans.
Closures of roads during smog risk times is one possibility. Another
is a strategy to deter car commuting, with cycle routes, higher parking
charges and encouragement to use public transport.
But a DoE spokesman said it was too late for much to be done to tackle
the current problems.
''It would be inappropriate for new local authority activities to
commence until a proper framework of regulation and guidance has been
provided,'' he said.
Talks were planned between Department officials and local authority
associations to agree details of powers needed, he said. Guidance would
then be issued.
''We would hope to have the groundwork done by the end of this year
and we are trying to take it forward as quickly as we can in time for
next year,'' he added.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher attacked the Government's
attempt to persuade motorists to leave their cars at home.
''This discredited Government scales new heights of absurdity daily,''
he said.
''The Tories abandon public transport to the free market. Fewer people
use buses, fewer people use trains, fares rise, services are cut.
''Then, when people take to their cars because they have no
alternative, the Tories tell them they should stay at home.
''This is Tory transport policy -- stop or choke.''
The British Lung Foundation said motorists leaving their cars at home
would be helping millions of people.
''It's not just asthmatics who suffer from the soaring air pollution
levels and the relentless heat,'' said Foundation director Ian Govendir.
''It's also a grave concern for those people with bronchitis,
emphysema and a host of other chronic lung diseases. To ease the burden
on the five million people with lung disease we urge the public to leave
their cars at home whenever possible.''

<HEADLINE>Global warming question has scientists under high pressure</HEADLINE>

Is global warming upon us? Most scientists are hedging their bets,
writes Elizabeth Buie, while others believe the answer will soon be
apparent.
AS August dawns as hot as a near record July, and we look back on a
June that gave us snow one day and scorching heat the next, the question
is again being asked: Are we experiencing nothing more than a natural
fluctuation in weather, or are the predictors of global warming being
proved right?
Even if last month did break any records, that in itself will not tell
us whether global warming is taking place, according to climatologists.
It is the duration of the hot spell and how it fits into the pattern of
other years.
While most scientists are still hedging their bets on global warming,
saying they work in 30-year averages, do not have enough data yet, etc.
etc., some feel that in 10 years' time we will know one way or the
other.
Dr Gareth Jones, head of Strathclyde University's geography
department, said: ''The sort of weather we are getting at present is not
atypical of weather conditions in Britain. It is being caused by a large
high pressure system which has built up over Europe and is expanding up
over Britain. What is unusual is the length of time the high pressure
system has lasted, the number of systems establishing themselves, and
the duration of time this very good weather has lasted.''
Since 1989, said Dr Jones, average temperatures for summer have been
getting warmer, although last year was an exception. The sort of weather
conditions we are receiving now are typical of a trend towards warming
conditions and are typical of the conditions we would expect to be
sustained with global warming -- but it is impossible to say at this
time whether global warming has occurred, he said.
Working on comparisons of 30-year averages, Dr Jones concludes that
''there is no doubt that conditions have significantly warmed''.
''The question everyone wants to know is whether this is a genuine
global warming or just a natural fluctuation. There is no way of saying
that until we are 10 years down the line. But the Government is now
prepared to work according to the precautionary principle that was
agreed at the Rio de Janeiro environmental conference in 1992. That
principle suggests that if we are uncertain of what is happening, it is
better to take a little time and err on the safe side,'' he said.
Dr Jones, who yesterday was one of those who heeded a Government plea
to drivers on pollution and worked from home, suggested that legislation
may be necessary to make people change their behaviour.
The increasing use of electronic mail and Internet systems would, he
said, make home-working easier.
It was the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that first made
the world take the possibility of global warming seriously. Its report
claims that we should know for sure by the year 2030. Dr Jones, however,
said that statistics were getting better all the time, and if the
current trend continued for the next 10 years, these should prove a good
indicator of whether we are moving into a particular climatic type.
Evidence of global warming, he said, was based on maximum average
temperatures and the length of time that critical temperatures are
reached. From the climatologist's point of view, the critical
temperature is 5.6C. When that temperature is reached, the growing
season is reckoned to have begun -- and when it drops below 5.6C, the
growing season has stopped.
Dr Jones has lived in the same house for 22 years and has kept a note
of the flowering dates of his plants. His daffodils, for instance, have
been appearing earlier in spring over that period, although he does
accept that as flowers establish themselves in a garden they will grow
stronger naturally and flower earlier.
But it is not simply higher temperatures and more sunshine that may
indicate global warming. Other indicators are rainfall levels, the
amount of evaporation, and the direction of winds.
A warmer atmosphere may mean that moisture circulates more quickly,
making it evaporate more quickly and turn into rain. Wetter winters are
therefore likely, as well as more snow at high altitude.
Extreme weather conditions may also be significant, and this year
alone there have been plenty of those:
* freak blizzards in New Zealand last month at the same time as the
Gulf States were inundated with six feet of water;
* hailstones as big as basketballs, a rainstorm and a tornado in
China's southern Guangdong province, killing 37 people and injuring 453
others in April;
* *the deaths of almost 400 people in India in the country's longest
and most severe heatwave when the temperature hits 47C (116.6F) in
Lucknow in June;
* a five-day heatwave in the Chicago area which caused the death of at
least 224 people last month;
* a Spanish heatwave in which temperatures in the south reached 46.4C
(116F) and caused 35 deaths;
* widespread flooding in February in France, the Netherlands and
Germany;
* evidence that warming of the world's oceans has caused the water
temperature off San Diego to rise by between two and three degrees
Fahrenheit, wiping out a critical link in the food-chain for marine life
off America's West Coast;
* scientists have reported that Antarctica's ancient ice shelf has
begun to break up in warming seas;
* and a report yesterday from the British Antarctic Survey that the
ozone ''hole'' over Antarctica is still deepening.
Closer to home, the victims of flooding in Paisley and Kirkintilloch
may also have been blaming global warming when they had to abandon their
homes over Christmas.
The situation may not be as clear-cut as that, however. Human
intervention is often to blame when people's lives are destroyed by
severe weather conditions.
As populations grow, we are expanding into areas which are more
climatically hazardous such as the flood plains of Mississipi.
''Even in Paisley, the houses have been built in areas which were not
considered suitable in the past because local builders did not have the
technology to safeguard against these hazards,'' said Dr Jones.
While sounding a note of caution, Dr Jones said: ''I think we are
seeing real signs of changes in global climate patterns and that we have
got enough evidence to show that global warming is taking place. But we
still need more time.
''That is not to say that we have not had a period where we have had
similar blips in the climate, but the last 10 years have been quite
different from previous decades.''

Occasionally we threatened people, which is the true Chicago way
After their success last year at the Fringe, David Belcher wonders
what lies in store for comic improvisers Modern Problems in Science this
time out
IT would probably be true to say that without the three free-wheeling
free-thinkers who comprise Modern Problems In Science, the Chicago
Performance Mafia stage-coach would not be rolling into Edinburgh with
such numbers aboard this year. Much interest was aroused at home in
Illinois, you see, by the success which accrued during last summer's
Fringe to the fully-improvised, deeply-bogus academic lectures conjured
up by Dick Costolo, Rich Fulcher, and Phil Granchi.
Among the glowing plaudits which winged across the Atlantic there was
the one in The Herald which saluted Modern Problems In Science for
staging ''a tour de force of comic improvisation which displays
freshness and wonderful resourcefulness in a highly original
entertainment.''
Other papers did them equally proud. ''Their quick-wittedness is
prodigious and their entertainment value unbeatable,'' quoth one.
''Using every intellectual weapon at their disposal -- sarcasm,
outrageous puns, digressive story-telling, exceptionally complicated
diagrams on a blackboard -- these funny, verbally-adept performers spoof
sloppy thinking, popular culture, and the foibles of academics,'' purred
another.
Not that such honeyed words have led to riches in abundance for the
trio in the year since they were penned. Indeed, Modern Problems In
Science's sole concrete reward so far has been the return trip the combo
made to Edinburgh in March to star in five Traverse shows at the city's
International Science Festival. Why, two out of the three of them have
even had to retain their Chicago day-jobs.
Dick Costolo's dual degree in theatre and computer studies has mostly
been put to work in designing client/server computer applications. As
befits a man with a geology degree, Phil Granchi has been working
part-time at the Field Museum of Natural History. Only Rich Fulcher has
plunged more or less full-time into acting, via his involvement with
Annoyance Theatre -- an involvement incidentally shared by Messrs
Granchi and Costolo -- and as an understudy with one of Second City's
touring companies.
Nevertheless, the trio's Chicago compatriots have been greatly spurred
by the path Modern Problems In Science blazed through Scotland's purply
heather in 1994.
''Maybe a few people in Chicago now think that it's easier in
Edinburgh than it is,'' says Costolo. ''When we went over, we were
prepared to lose our shirts, and it must appear comforting that we still
managed to make a success of it. Attendances gradually snowballed over
the three weeks until we were sold out each night, in part because some
people were coming back to see the show as its improvisational nature
meant it would be different each time.''
Phil Granchi returns to the group's approved Edinburgh theme: hard
work. ''This year, if we're as good as we think we are, we're going to
have to work like crazy to achieve last year's level of success. Last
year we knew nothing.
''We had no expectations of money. We laboured for hours out on the
street outside the Fringe office. Handing out flyers. Engaging in
conversation with people who were standing in line. Occasionally
threatening some of them, which is the true Chicago way.''
In part, Modern Problems In Science may have been favoured by the
newness of long-form improvisation in Britain. Aside from brief bursts
of Josie Lawrence and the rest of the Comedy Store Players, most of whom
have cropped up alongside Clive Anderson on Whose Line Is It Anyway, our
exposure to advanced improv has been nil, quite unlike comedy lovers in
the US.
''There are improvised detective shows here,'' says Rich Fulcher.
''There's been an improvised Irish funeral, Flanagan's Wake; a Tennessee
Williams improv, Cast On A Hot Tin Roof. But what it always comes back
to is the fact that the best improv is always reality-based, and the
classroom environment in which we operate on stage is a reality with
which everyone is familiar . . . and where it becomes easy to concur
with some less-than-familiar theories: that the San Andreas Fault moves
in time to vibrations from the strings of B B King's guitar, for
example.''
Even stranger resonances hum through every topic that Modern Problems
In Science address in their oddly convincing lectures. In fact, the
trio's certainties are the stuff of other people's nightmares, as the
following examples might indicate.
Attend a Modern Problems In Science tutorial and you could come away
convinced that turqoise is the most powerful force in the universe;
Keanu Reeves' success is the cause of all global conflict; the Shroud of
Turin can be used to predict baseball scores; Beethoven's symphonies
were all written by Jim Morrison, and all American men are actually
women.
Where do such skewed bits of educational lore spring from? Do you have
to spend all your spare time reading lots of books and stuff, fellas?
Phil Granchi airily disavows the notion of study. ''Everything stems
from the fact that what we know, we know already,'' he states with
gnomic illogicality. ''You can't go away and learn anything for improv.
On stage, I've been at my most convincing when I've been talking about
ichthyology, and I don't know anything about ichthyology.
Maybe then you can tell me why Chicago has become a world centre for
theatre?
This is a question which the trio treat with uncharacteristic gravity,
obviously having pondered it repeatedly. It's a socio-economic thing,
they reckon.
While LA and New York have got the film and TV industries, Chicago's
got most of the performing talent because LA and New York can't afford
to set aside expensive floor-space in which impoverished improvisers can
hone their skills in front of small but appreciative audiences. In
post-industrial Chicago every redundant store and warehouse is home to a
theatre, a theatre group.
One final question: have you formulated a pithy mission-statement for
Edinburgh 95?
''We Are Three Wacky Guys Who Like To Have Fun,'' says Phil.
''And To Kick Ass At The Same Time,'' adds Dick.
''Just think of us as characters in a TV sitcom called Those Darned
Professors,'' concludes Rich. ''We all wear silly hats. We're all
divorced, living together in one house. One of us speaks Russian. And we
break into song at every opportunity.''
How better to think of Modern Problems In Science? They think weird,
therefore they are hilarious.
* Modern Problems In Science will be appearing nightly at the Assembly
Rooms, Edinburgh, during August.

EITHER modest or antisocial, that bloke. This is the impression
Terence Trent D'Arby gave to the layman for the first half hour of his
epic performance. Twenty-five minutes of continuous little-known
Kravitz-esque rock numbers, disappearing after each for a guitar change,
and generally not paying much attention to anything. Surely not for the
whole gig, I sobbed.
Thankfully, no. Dressed in luminous pink Lycra trousers, and looking
every bit an angel with blond cropped hair, he addressed his followers
with a promise of a rocking time -- and how many were diappointed? Not
one, layman or otherwise.
He swapped the bat-shaped guitars for some fancy hip and foot work,
throwing his athletic body into agile and theatrical acrobatics, oozing
about as much sexuality as one person can.
The R&amp;B tunes have always been and will remain what Terence Trent
D'Arby is best at. He told the crowd he'd dust off some old ones, and
that he did -- for the best part of two-and-a-half hours. A bit
overlong, yes. A tad self-indulgent, possibly.
But, oh, the encore! A nearly a cappella number by the band, an outfit
reminiscent of Shaft or what used to be Prince, a black wig, a whip, an
absolutely astounding version of the Rolling Stones's Gimme Shelter and
a sentimental promise to his older and wiser fans that he'd love to
return to Glasgow and that his biggest influence was Rod Stewart, for
whom he says he wrote Holding On To You (and actually it sounds not
unlike a Rod-penned tune). Nothing less than a perfect end to an overall
satisfying package.
The man is a fantastic musician, a beautiful singer, a brilliant
performer, a wonderful mover, a tease, and I'm hooked.

THE road is long; five-and-a-half days from New York to San Francisco,
from the hassles of an unfulfilled working life to possible redemption
through the escapism of true love. This one-man show, a world premiere
by the Californian-based Starving Artists Theatre Company, written by
Godfrey Hamilton and performed by Mark Pinkosh, takes us on an
instructive journey.
To describe it as a voyage of self-discovery is tempting but would be
trite; it is a particularised quest for one gay man, Joel, yet has wider
resonances. In charting Joel's tentative pursuit of romance Hamilton's
beautifully crafted script also steps confidently through an emotional
minefield, conjuring up the collective pain of a nation which has
suffered large-scale loss of its young men through Vietnam and through
Aids.
As he travels through Washington DC, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, and
California Joel encounters people in various stages of grief; the
elderly couple tracing their son's name on the Vietnam memorial in
Washington, a dope-smoking diva dishing out condoms and big-hearted
advice as a way of dealing with her son's death from Aids, a lonely
woman in the Nevada desert struggling to understand her daughter's
suicide. Pinkosh delicately evokes each through subtle physical
variation in an absorbing performance.
Hamilton's touch is sure, lyrically sweeping through psychological and
physical landscapes, but grounded in down-to-earth details; the
characters are never ciphers for sorrow. Their sadness it at odds with
Joel's buoyant optimism yet builds a mood which presages disappointment.
An elegiac production which is gently amusing as well as profoundly
moving.

Navy takes the young actors from rural Scotland to revolutionary
America, Imperial Russia, revolutionary France, and back to Scotland
again.
Sweeping changes of scene and costume suggest that director Graham
Hunter must have had several choreographic headaches along the way. And
that's even before he got round to sorting out the production's range of
theatrical modes: musical, farce, action, sitting-room comedy,
sentimental drama. Getting all this together is no small achievement.
Behind the play's epic intentions, though, it is a story of the
Scottish boy who runs away from home, searches for a purpose in the
smell of the sea and eventually regrets leaving his family and country.
And this mini-drama is acted out in the relationship of John Paul and
his sister, Janet. As children they pledge themselves to each other like
lovers and remain painfully bonded throughout. They intermittently
appear on stage as children, re-enacting early scenes where they dream
of the New World.
Dugie Gunn and Sally Anne Ogilvie make a pugnacious and touching pair
as the children, while Louise Boyle and David Colvin turn out believable
and surprisingly similar adult versions of the two. Together the four of
them are the stars of the show, producing sound perfomances.
Overall it's too long, too slow, and too sentimental, with the cast
giving performances which waver between good, overdone, and terrible.
But there are plenty of funny and moving moments which stretch the young
actors and make it worth while.

OUR new Republican Congress is churning along with its programme to
change America, to reverse 70 years of Democratic social legislation and
prepare for a prosperous and Republican 21st century. It is also doing
its best to elect two men President next year, and since only one man at
a time can hold the job, certain contradictions are emerging.
This week's example is welfare reform. This is one of the most solid
planks the Republican Party stands on. It was also one of Mr Clinton's
most solid planks when he ran in 1992, promising ''to end welfare as we
know it'', and his failure to keep the promise in his first two years
has cost him dear.
There is a consensus that the welfare system hasn't worked, that it
has made the poor poorer, at enormous cost. So what reform would win the
most votes? That's a shockingly cynical way of putting it. Try again.
What reform would most surely contribute to ending illegitimacy, send
the idle poor to productive work, restore marriage as the basis of
society, and reduce taxes and balance the budget?
President Clinton wants to tinker with the system. Senator Bob Dole
wants root and branch reform. Senator Phil Gramm wants to abolish it.
Senator Gramm's proposals are the most interesting and appalling. He
is supported by over 20 Republican senators, which means that Senator
Dole cannot get his more moderate version of reform through the Senate
without dealing with the ultra-right. Mr Gramm, who launched his bid for
the nomination early this year, has staked his political future on the
issue. The enemy, of course, is not the welfare system, President
Clinton, or the Democrats in Congress. It is Bob Dole.
Mr Gramm has found the stick with which to beat the front-runner (Dole
is far more popular than he). He calls him a ''moderate'', a term he
pronounces with as much scorn as true believers use when mentioning
those spawn of Satan, the ''liberals''. He says the Dole proposals
''leave 90% of the welfare bureaucracy in place, subsidising failure and
irresponsible behaviour''.
Some of his proposals are the same as Senator Dole's. They both
propose to scrap most federal welfare programmes, handing the money over
to the states instead. States would be allowed great discretion in
spending the money (derived from federal taxes).
President Clinton points out that many states might be tempted to use
the additional revenues for other purposes, including tax cuts, roads,
and retirement benefits for elderly, voting Republicans.
Mr Dole would write in some protection for the poor, providing that
the programmes now directed by the federal government must be continued
by the states. Mr Gramm will have none of that and wants to end some of
the programmes anyway, and at once. Teenage mothers would lose
assistance immediately, and unmarried mothers on the dole would lose
their welfare cheques if they had additional children. Furthermore, any
unmarried mother on welfare who refused to tell the authorities the
identity of her child's father would be cut off instantly.
No doubt about it, this is a radical programme. It is described by its
supporters as ''tough love''.
No doubt there would be a difficult period of transition (Speaker Newt
Gingrich has suggested orphanages) before the feckless poor at last
faced up to their obligations and set out to find jobs and support
themselves. But there is a glorious Republican future ahead, and if Mr
Gramm's proposals are accepted, we will head confidently back to the
1930s and 1920s of golden memory.
Or at least this is what the senator from Texas proposes. It won't
actually happen. Despite its apparent frenzy of callousness and
selfishness, the United States is not going to put hundreds of thousands
of children on to the streets. Mr Gramm's intention is to embarrass
Senator Dole and win points from the conservatives who, allegedly, will
control the nominating process next year. He is desperate to establish
himself as the most conservative of candidates (he is being sapped on
the right by Patrick Buchanan, who is even more extreme on every
imaginable position). The way to do that is to make Sen Dole look
moderate -- and he is succeeding wonderfully.
The President will veto the Bill, in its Dole or Gramm versions, and
there are probably not the votes to defeat the veto. His own much more
modest proposals might then get enacted, as the only viable alternative,
so the Republican dissension may hand him a nice little victory.
It is far too early to write off the Republican revolution but one
thing is quite clear: there is a danger that many of its proposals will
be defeated by their own extremism. The answer is that a real revolution
must be directed from the White House -- which is why they are fighting
so bitterly among themselves to get there.

THERE is something of a Jacobite orgy going on in this summer of the
250th anniversary of the '45. I have to admit my part in it, as director
of the major academic conference on the subject, organised by the
Eighteenth-Century Scottish Studies Society at the University of
Aberdeen this week.
The junketings are not to everybody's taste. One of our Irish
delegates has already given us a paper called ''Dead conventions, most
persistent and wearisome'', which deals with Jacobite verse. Those who
detest the shortbread-tin side of the heritage industry will know just
what he means.
Our conference is, of course, meant to counteract all that and say
something sensible instead. This is more possible now than it would have
been even just a few years ago. In the meantime, authors such as Bruce
Lenman at St Andrews and John Gibson in Edinburgh have applied modern
scholarly technique to all the hoary old sources. They and others have
allowed us to see Jacobitism for what it was, a complex movement, the
product of social and intellectual forces welling up from deeper levels
in the life of Scotland than anything directly represented by Prince
Charles Edward Stewart.
So, other things being equal, we have the chance of building up over
the years ahead quite a reasonable Jacobite historiography as, in the
usual academic manner, hewers of wood and drawers of water set to work
to clad the framework erected by the innovators.
All very nice, but our conference has brought out too the presence of
a few gremlins trying to ensure that this gleaming new edifice takes on
a particular appearance. In fact it almost seems to me that some are
trying to put the process of construction into reverse, to make Jacobite
history not more complex and richer, but simpler and cruder. Why should
any historian do this? The answer is political, to place the Jacobites,
and the emotional charge they still carry, at the service of modern
Scottish nationalism.
It has been said here in Aberdeen that Jacobitism was ''the only means
of expressing Scottish nationalism after 1707''. It may seem strange for
me to question the nationalist quality of Jacobitism, given that Prince
Charles decreed the dissolution of the Union. But he left no doubt that
it was a British, not a Scottish, Crown that he aimed to restore to his
father's head.
The logical conclusion is that he sought a return to the Union of the
Crowns, the constitutional position between 1603 and 1707. This position
was regarded by contemporaries, and is still regarded by historians, as
a good deal more miserable for Scotland than the full independence which
preceded it or the full Union which followed it.
There is nothing to indicate that Charles or any other Jacobite had
thought for a moment how to make a rerun less miserable. If they had won
in 1745 it is likely that Scottish disillusion would have been swift. It
may not be going too far to suggest that, since pre-1603 independence
had now become impossible, the Union might simply have been renegotiated
with some cosmetic improvements.
Would that have outraged the ragged Highland hordes who followed
Charles into England? There is no special reason to think so. Those
clansmen, and the chiefs who led them, went with him not primarily
because they were nationalists, to liberate Scotland, but because they
were legitimists, and felt it their duty to follow their lawful prince.
If they were willing to follow him to the death, it is hard to believe
that they would not in other circumstances have been willing to follow
him into a renegotiated Union.
This political ambiguity no doubt explains why the prince was able to
make so little of what nationalist appeal he may have had for the Scots.
His message was ''my rights will secure your happiness'', rather than
''a free Scotland''. But Scots were perfectly capable of making the
calculation for themselves, and did not believe him, did not even
pretend to believe him when it could have been to their advantage.
October 30, 1745, the birthday of the Hanoverian King George II, saw
popular demonstrations of loyalty in several places, including
Edinburgh, which the Jacobites were at that moment actually occupying.
In Perth there was bloodshed, when the rioters got the better of the
prince's soldiers ordered to quell them. These were ordinary working
men, said to be Whigs and presbyterians, and evidently intent on
upholding the rights they felt themselves to be guaranteed by the Union
and the free British constitution. They were ready to fight and die for
those rights: were they less Scottish than the troops who shot them
down?
Were they indeed less nationalist? It is an odd historical
interpretation which takes two different, but by any standards equally
valid, expressions of Scottishness at the time, to label the one
nationalist and the other non-nationalist. Presbyterian Whiggery had
defended Scottish nationhood at least as sturdily as Jacobite
traditionalism ever had. To write the story otherwise is just to write
history wrong.
Scotland, for her size, has always been an amazingly varied and
complicated country, and Jacobitism shared in that, just as Whiggery
did. Jacobitism was not just about one simple political aim, it was a
whole attitude to life, a sensibility, a darker and more tragic
alternative to the optimistic rationalism of the Enlightenment. It could
be more or less nationalist, just as the opposition to it could.
To reduce the whole of a fascinating conflict to the single dimension
of independence, or not, for Scotland impoverishes history, and so
impoverishes our present reality. But it does seem to be an item high on
the agenda of cultural nationalists, and that should give us all pause.

KEEP it to yourself but the word on the street is that the woman of
the moment, Kylie Minogue, is to show up at The Tunnel in Glasgow on
Saturday night prior to her Sunday appearance at the pop extravaganza T
in the Park. This is heady news and a guaranteed crowd puller as Kylie
enjoys unprecedented and strangely unfathomable popularity among men and
women, heterosexuals and gays.
Back in 1990 she ditched her little-girl-lost look for a sex kitten
make-over, but despite the leathers, the khol overdose, the wet clinging
T-shirts, and the fake tattoos she has, bizarrely, retained her
girl-next-door approachability. To bump into her at the local pub holds
a certain allure; men might be suckers for her sultry pouts but I could
imagine exchanging make-up tips with her in the ladies (''Kylie, any
hints?'' ''Sure, use more khol.'')
To watch her being interviewed is to be in the presence of the Goddess
of Nice. During a spot on breakfast television last week her niceness
was so irrepressible and effervescent that she actually managed to make
the gooey Anthea Turner -- and I'm with Morrissey on this one, finding
Anthea's permanent plastic smile absolutely nauseating -- seem bitchy.
More amazingly, Kylie makes niceness, a desperately untrendy quality,
seem, well, hip. You couldn't help but warm to her jaunty humour and
flirty, foxy ways.
Her name is on everyone's lips and most men I know wish her lips were
on them. She's become a major cover girl, selling copies of magazines as
diverse as the arty The List to the laddish Loaded, where she is the
stellar attraction in a star swimsuit photo special. All my mates, of
both sexes, are going to T in the Park expressly for the purpose of
watching Kylie, inspired by a mixture of lust and curiosity. Miss Cutie
Pie has become Miss Pin-Up. Men love her revamped vamp image and women
cannot fail to admire her capacity for reinvention.
This skill is crucial. In our fickle times to be a chameleon is all
important, as Madonna has so adroitly demonstrated. The glam queens of
yesteryear, from Marilyn Monroe to Jackie O, found a style which suited
them and stuck with it. That's old hat now, as Claudia Schiffer recently
learned to her cost, being blasted as boring by Jean-Paul Gaultier for
not updating her image.
The modern miss likes to experiment with the size of her hairdos and
her heels and feels respect for women in the public eye who do so too.
And if the new looks are the wrong looks -- Kylie with red hair? The
jury's still out -- so much the better. At least she has the guts and
originality to try something new.
It probably started with a kiss. From Michael Hutchence. Her
relationship, at the age of 21, with the groovy pop hunk conferred cool
status on her and kick-started her on a road to self-discovery which has
involved many experimental byways. I reviewed Kylie in a pre-Hutch
concert in 1990 and sneeringly compared her with a Cindy doll. The only
adults in the audience were those escorting the tiny-tot fans, and
Kylie's set was a nightmare vision of pink and a gaspy loveheart red
which could have been designed by Barbara Cartland. Her adolescent pop,
slickly crafted by hit factory PWL, had built-in obsolescence and it
seemed inconceivable that she could hang around for the future.
But through guile and a hefty dose of enigma she snuck out from under
her label and built herself a new career. A few months and a Hutchence
later she had ditched the sugary trappings and started to spice things
up. Being caught with a pair of handcuffs in her bag going through
customs was a publicity dream on par with Hugh Grant's escapade but
without the attendant criminal complications. The spectre of Charlene,
her Goody Two-Shoes character in Neighbours, was well and truly shrugged
off; a suspected spot of S and M was all a far cry from the days of her
teen romance with Jason Donovan.
For a while it looked as if Kylie, like Madonna, changed her boyfriend
as often as her hairstyle. Further reported dalliances with Evan Dando,
Prince, and Julian Lennon might have been apocryphal but were
profile-enhancing all the same. Her current beau is the eminently saucy
Australian actor Mark Gerber who, as the blind stud, provided the only
sexual spark in Sirens.
She's not only crafted a new musical career, making dance singles with
the hit label Deconstruction, she's also ignored the critical cavils
which greeted her debut film appearance in Delinquents to forge a
Hollywood career and will be following up her gun-toting action-girl
role in the Jean Claude van Damme movie Streetfighter as a psycho in the
short film Hayride to Hell.
It seems that she won't stand still long enough to be typecast again.
She certainly wriggles about enough in the promo for her new single
Where is the Feeling? which, despite the Antipodean's touchiness about
comparisons to Madonna, is not a million miles removed from that
artist's Erotica, featuring as it does deepthroat vocals from Kylie --
''Anytime you want me to/I can make you happy''.
When she struts her stuff on stage on Sunday she can do so in the
triumphant knowledge that she has seen off her detractors. Virgin
Radio's launch campaign might have impishly declared ''We've done
something to improve Kylie's songs -- we've banned them'' but it looks
like she has the last laugh. One of the most successful recording
artists in history in terms of Top Ten hits -- notching up more than
Elvis, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, or Madonna -- she's still selling
songs and standing tall.
Well, maybe not tall. Kylie is so shrimplike that she doesn't even
like anyone dancing near her in case it draws attention to her
vertically challenged stature. So, if you do bump into her at The
Tunnel, be sure to give her a bit of space. Heck, the babe deserves it.

* STYLEFILE is compressed this week, but in space rather than content,
which is the same ambition held by producers of the latest handy
accessory. We've had bumbags, which a large percentage of the population
wore on their midriff, now we have the Armi, which, if you haven't
guessed, one wears on one's arm. Travel product company ''Go'' empathise
so much with the everyday problem of carrying valuables, that they have
found somewhere else on the body for us to stick them. Armis will hold
cash, credit cards, and keys in one neat purse. The adjustable strap
means you can wear it at wrist level or above the elbow, which, in this
position, if your coinage is profuse, will have the added bonus of
toning upper arms. Armis are #3.99 from Frasers and Debenhams.
* THERE are some things you can never practise in public, and,
regardless of its claims, the Slendertone Gymbody 8, is one of them. It
is a portable muscle toner that ''enables you to continue with everyday
life while toning either stomach and buttock muscles''. Slendertone (a
sort of wrestler's belt with electrodes) is, the manufacturer says, for
women who have a bad back, don't like the sweatiness of physical work,
or need to lose weight for wedding day photos. The makers advocate using
the toner everywhere for maximum effectiveness, which means basically,
that you have to ensure that you are always near a power point to plug
yourself in. This might narrow your social life somewhat. Only for the
desperate, the Gymbody 8 costs #109, call 0345 697 278 to order.
* PRACTICAL yet glamorous, Marigold, the UK's leading rubber glove
brand is launching its new range of household gloves -- Marigold Kitchen
Extra Life and Marigold Bathroom. They will be available this month and
you would have expected a camped up ad campaign. The launch could have
featured Vera Duckworth, Dame Edna Everage, Lily Savage or other female
impersonators. But no, Marigold are trying to sell to the higher
classes, for rubber gloves are art, and photographer David Bailey, no
less, has taken the shots which feature a model wearing virtually
nothing (quelle surprise) but her Marigolds which provide ''The Best
Skincare On Hand''. These pretentious tableaux will haunt female
consumer magazines from this month onwards.
* IT'S a long way down for a feminist icon to fall. Quondam Superwoman
and storyteller Shirley Conran is in league with cosmetic giant Rimmel.
Rimmel's new eye shadow collection has the same name as Conran's new
novel. ''I love No 7'' she purrs. Her blockbuster is called Tiger Eyes,
and if you buy any shadow from No 7's range you receive the book free,
not the other way around, which might save some of the poor luv's
credibility. No 7 Colour Perfect Eyeshadow start from #3.50

OK, so summer shoes do nothing for the ego -- but hey, that's cool,
isn't it? Anvar Khan and photographer Mark Mann take a sideways look at
the sidewalk
IT HAS been said that a woman who wears sloppy shoes has no
neuroticism. The Sloane Ranger who uses her canvas slip-ons crushed
under her heel as flip-flops, the farmer's wife who lives in all-purpose
wellies, these are examples of psychologically healthy women who have a
bovine faith in their abilities. The wicked spinster in pop culture
should never have worn plain, sensible flatties, but should have been
walking on heights as sinister, spiky and as shaky as the Scott
Monument.
Footwear highlights character flaws, in the way of showy spats worn by
testosterone-inflamed gangsters. The desire to make it is fuelled by
insecurity. Driven, sensual, ambitious women wear aggressive shoes. The
egotistical Imelda Marcos illustrated her diatribe against the world
with her innumerable pairs. The Scots are not an obvious comparison, but
they're in there. When it comes to chalking up figures, Scottish women
allegedly own more pairs of shoes pro rata than their English
counterparts. This suggests weakness, a wholesome, free range, intrinsic
fear. A feeling of inadequacy. Again, Marcos annoyed hundreds of soles
and wore them, because she had both the money and the various dubious,
glitzy occasions. Most women buy a lot of shoes because they don't have
anywhere to wear them. In this way, it becomes obvious, just how
integral the shoe is to the female ego and her sense of vanity.
This summer, the public have been well entertained by tribes of
footwear in the shops, including plimsoles, sandals and jellies (these
are not named after the drug Temazapam, as a concerned collegue
suspected, the name is merely a description of the sandal's softness and
transparency.) And here, The Herald showcases a few items being
patronised by the hot sun. But this is not the full story. Still, women
buy straps and suede, nubuck and buckles. Buying shoes is not a seasonal
affair, and neither are we. This is no holiday romance. Summer wear is
tolerated, but at night, women turn inside to mince about in their
selected best. Glamorous footwear looks as if you're trying too hard,
and therefore looks as if you have more to hide.
There is an element of hard work in being scarily feminine, and you
can admire the Angelica Houstons and Zsa-Zsa Gabors of this world for
their unrelenting dedication to emancipating the female race from
dowdiness. Dressing-down is common and practical, two qualities which
vamps successfully edit out their lives. What counts against casual
summer footwear is that it is both cheap and accessible. And how many
real women want to be seen as that?
It may seem irreverent but there are major heroines in history, of
whom it is possible to speculate accurately on their footwear, because
we have the advantage of assessing their lives and characters from what
they did rather than what they said. Showy, determined and bad, Helen of
Troy, Boadicea, Cleopatra and Queen Elizabeth I are definite candidates
for extravagant, diamond-plated commissions. Joan of Arc and Florence
Nightingale could have been candidates for bold heels if they had been
honest about their eccentricity, rather than promulgating their
angelicism. The only possible candidate for self-sacrificing, functional
footwear is Mother Theresa, who has neither id nor personal ideology. In
truth, the desire for self-improvement is a woman's only evolutionary
step. She is more likely to have invented the hair-roller than the
wheel, and which has been the most useful I cannot decide. And as long
as she is neurotic, a woman will seek out shoes which convey the
kinkiest part of her make-up.

SCOTLAND is living under a dangerous cloud of summertime smog, which

The pressure group said that Department of Environment guidelines on
combating ozone pollution levels released yesterday, which forecast poor
air quality' only in London and South and Central England glossed over
''serious deteriorations'' in Scottish air quality.
FOE claim that while Scotland consistently conforms to Government
eight hour limits on ozone levels of 89-90 parts per billion, World
Health Organisation limits of 50ppb are regularly breached.
Last week Eskdalemuir in the Borders measured 53-58ppb and Strath
Vaich in the Highlands, 52-61ppb over three consecutive days.
FOE Scotland director Mr Kevin Dunion said: ''We are in the era of
Orwellspeak. Good is bad according to the Scottish Office.
''They seem to have an extremely complacent attitude to air quality,
which has a direct impact on many people's health.''
However, Dr Ken Anderson, a Scottish councillor of the British Lung
Foundation said that he expected ''no signiciant upturn'' in serious
cases of asthma and lung complaints despite the hot weather.
He said: ''Most existing asthma sufferers will simply be a little more
wheezy at the moment and may find themselves doubling their inhaler
doses.''
He advised asthma sufferers to avoid areas with large build ups of
traffic and road runners to cut down on long distance exercise.
He added: ''There is still no such thing as a safe dosage of ozone.
The substance can oxidise anything it comes into contact with, such as
taking the sheen off metal and in the case of lung tissue cause serious
inflammation.''
Meanwhile, the lessons of the June heatwave appear to have been
learned as Scottish hospitals yesterday reported treating few cases of
heatstroke and sunburn.
Accident and Emergency consultant at Glasgow's Western Infirmary Mr
Willie Tullett, whose department was innundated with heat sufferers
during June, said: ''This is a familiar pattern. During the first
heatwave of the summer, everyone goes out and gets sunburnt but are
wiser the second time around.''
A SENIOR fire officer in the Highlands was yesterday praying for heavy
rain. Since Saturday afternoon, more than 100 firefighters have been
fighting a forestry blaze in the hills above Inverness. Swirling winds
have made their task extremely dangerous.
Divisional Officer Mr John Cheadle admitted yesterday: ''The fire is
now embedded in the peat and could smoulder away for months, flaring up
now and again in different places.
''We are hosing water, dropping buckets-loads from helicopters and
using beaters, but all it is doing is putting out the flames on top.
''The peat still burns underneath, and short of digging up acres of
moorland, we can't do much about it.
''In short, our only hope is heavy rain to drench the moorland and put
out the burning embers below the surface.''
WRVS volunteers and local residents have been helping the firefighters
with a constant supply of cool drinks and sandwiches 24 hours a day
since the fire broke out.
THE prolonged hot weather is bringing with it risks of fish kills in
the West of Scotland, particularly on the River Clyde.
A spokesman at the Clyde River Purification Board said yesterday that
fish mortality due to heat stress was something they were watching for.
The fish kill on the Clyde around Glasgow Green last week, which
included many large salmon, was probably partly due to the low flows and
lack of oxygen in the water. But the Board also says that some form of
pollution could not be discounted.
At the moment the day time temperatures were exceeding the levels at
which salmon, trout and sea trout become stressed but the cooling period
at night was allowing sufficient respite. Smaller waters could become
vulnerable soon, however.

THE widow and children of a coastguard who died when his car crashed
into the back of a lorry which had broken down, have been awarded
damages of #87,735.
The family of Mr Donald Campbell, 37, would have been awarded nearly
#220,000 but a judge decided that Mr Campbell was 60% to blame for the
accident.
Mr Campbell, of Marsco Place, Portree, Skye, was killed on February 2,
1990, when his Vauxhall Astra, travelling at 60mph, ploughed into the
back of the lorry.
The accident took place at 8pm on a straight stretch of the A87 Fort
William to Kyle of Lochalsh road near Shiel Bridge.
His widow, Mrs Cairena Campbell, now 33, sued on her own behalf and
for her two sons, nine-year-old Hugh and Iain, aged eight.
She raised the action against Mr Grigor Talbot, a breakdown mechanic,
of Glebe Road, Inverinate, Ross-shire, and his employers, F and F
Motors, of Plockton Road, Kyle of Lochalsh.
In a written judgment, issued at the Court of Session yesterday,
temporary judge Mr Donald Robertson QC said Mr Talbot had been called
out to the lorry, which had broken down in darkness on the A87.
The hazard lights had been switched on to warn other traffic but Mr
Talbot had to disconnect the lorry's battery and the lights went out. Mr
Campbell's car crashed into the lorry when it was unlit.
The judge said the mechanic should have parked at the rear of the
lorry with hazard lights flashing. Instead, he parked his van in front
when he disconnected its battery.
Mr Robertson added: ''In putting off the lights, he . . . created a
serious danger on the roadway to northbound traffic.
''At the same time, there was a simple precaution which could easily
have been taken and would have reduced the risks substantially, namely
parking the transit vehicle at the rear of the lorry.
''Had he done so, that would probably have obviated any risk of an
accident and any risk of a driver not observing the lorry in good time,
even when travelling at around 60mph, as Mr Campbell probably was.''
However, the judge also ruled that Mr Campbell had been at fault,
since at least two other vehicles had seen and avoided the lorry in the
darkness.
An accident investigator testified that Mr Campbell should have seen
something in front of him at about 75 yards on dipped lights and 230
yards on full beam.
Mr Robertson attributed blame for the accident to both the breakdown
mechanic and Mr Campbell and decided that Mr Campbell was 60% at fault
for what happened.
The judge decided that if Mr Campbell had been blameless, he would
have awarded the family damages of #219,343. He reduced that by 60%,
giving a total figure of #87,735.

FOOTBALL fans face a TV blackout of live games in brewery-owned pubs
in a dispute over how much Sky charges publicans.
Scotland's big three brewers are concerned that Sky wants to increase
charges by up to 200% for the right to show live matches in pubs.
Independent publicans have already complained about the new charges,
which could go as high as #120 a month from #40 last year, for the Sky
Sports channel.
A Scottish Brewers' spokesman said: ''We do not welcome this increase,
and we are currently reviewing the use of the service. A decision will
be reached very soon after talks at board level.''
A Tennents' spokesman said: ''We have just heard of this increase and
we will also have to give some thought to our future relationship with
Sky.''
At Alloa Breweries, a spokeswoman commented: ''We are not happy with
this and we will be taking a long look at our policy as regards having
Sky in our pubs.''
There are also fears that fans in privately-owned pubs may have to pay
more for their drink to cover the extra cost.
Scottish Licensed Trade Association executive Colin Wilkinson warned:
''Some publicans will pass on the increased cost by making the price of
drink dearer.
No-one at Sky was available for comment.

As she prepares to celebrate her 95th birthday this week, the
changeless and timeless royal still walks above the woes of Windsor,
writes Anne Simpson.
FIVE years away from notching up a personal century, the Queen Mother
celebrates her birthday on Friday, and as the greetings roll in and the
media dusts down its ritual ode, any stranger to these shores must
wonder what it is about monarchy that sends the British potty.
Today, of course, amid tumult and uncertainty, the Queen Mother is
regarded as a tranquillising constant in our national life. At 95 she
symbolises, for many, a reassuring continuity -- in her presence all
will carry on and carry on with grace. Her performance at each
appearance -- and each appearance is a performance -- is never less than
perfect, yet all around her the fabric of social order has changed
utterly, a profound cynicism replacing humble faith.
Even her daughter, the sovereign, has altered in some measure by
accepting now that her vast income should be taxed and that as Queen she
should foot the bill for lesser royals. By special appointment, rather
over-awed camera crews have stepped over the private threshold of her
many demesnes, permitting us to view Her Majesty watching the Nine
O'Clock News, Her Majesty feeding a carrot to a horse.
We have seen the Queen place glasses on her nose for the State Opening
of Parliament, but who among us has ever observed the Queen Mother
wearing spectacles? After her cataract operation the other week, she
left hospital in brilliant sunshine, not with tinted lenses but dressed
in her customary fluorescence, shimmering like a beacon.
In her upturned brims and diamonds rampant the Queen Mother is
changeless and thus curiously timeless. Even so, she must be affected by
the public's present perception of her favourite grandchild as flowerpot
man and whingeing heir. Irritated too (if not downright incensed) by the
younger in-laws' clear misunderstanding of duty.
There are several lines in the film The Madness of King George which
find an eerie resonance in today's royal dilemmas, but the following,
whispered by the king to his tormented relatives, could well be the
Queen Mother's personal credo: ''There are model farms, model villages.
We must be a model family. Let them see we're happy. It is why we're
here.''
If anyone knows about the burden of royalty and its intrusion on
private life it is Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon who, as the younger daughter of
the Laird of Glamis, long hesitated over the marriage proposal from the
Duke of York because she was unsure whether she wanted the
responsibilities of being his duchess. However, having finally accepted
the hand of the shy and stammering George, she succeeded, through her
own will, in separating the two worlds of duty and domestic simplicity.
''The quiet house in the Park at Windsor was one of the most important
backgrounds for her children,'' wrote a reverential biographer, Hector
Bolitho in 1952. ''There Princess Elizabeth and her sister, Princess
Margaret Rose, often played with the children of the foresters near the
river by which the Saxon swineherds lived in the time of Edward the
Confessor. The princesses learned to ride down glades where William the
Conqueror must have hunted, and open fields where Queen Anne used to
follow the hounds . . . ''
Such lyrical appraisal could not be more remote from the rapacious
voyeurism which we apply to the Windsors today. But would Elizabeth
Bowes-Lyon ever have married the Duke had she known his destiny? His
ascension to the throne on Edward's abdication, because of his brother's
careless love affair with a doubly-divorced American, filled Elizabeth
with foreboding.
She despised Wallis Simpson's hard-edged elegance which exposed the
parochial grandeur of the British Establishment as well as its arrogant
hypocrisy. But, in a complex way, Elizabeth became indebted to this
socially ambitious interloper, for without the Duchess of Windsor to
hate, Britain would never have been able to cultivate its strange
adoration of the Queen Mother.
This woman whom Wallis dismissed in wise-cracking bitchery as ''a fat
cook'' and ''the Monster of Glamis'', loathed the Duchess with the
ferocity of a widow's grievance, believing the pressures imposed on her
delicate husband by Edward's selfishness had accelerated his early
death.
Yet, as Caroline Blackwood points out in her study The Last of the
Duchess, the two old adversaries were brought together by the Duke's own
death in 1972. And on that day of bizarre solemnity when he was buried
at Frogmore, it was Elizabeth who, moved to pity, came forward to kiss
the Duchess who was suddenly disintegrating under the weight of
sedatives, vodka and loss.
The Queen Mother's subjects, of course, will never hear her reflect on
the woes in the unmerry House of Windsor, for there will never be
open-heart interviews with the likes of Dimbleby and Co. And yet, as we
know from that moment when Edward abandoned the throne for love, the
Queen Mother has always been aware of how to play the populist card.
Nevertheless, it was obviously more than populism which compelled her
wartime activities. Many ascribed her natural talent for practical
sympathy to Scottish common sense and a native ability to put people at
ease. She was stubborn, too: as the danger of German invasion increased
she was urged to go to Canada with the two princesses, but whenever the
suggestion was made she wouldn't even bother to reply. She had made up
her own mind -- the family was staying together in Britain.
Hector Bolitho records:
''When houses in the East End of London were bombed during night
raids, the Queen often hurried to the forlorn areas next morning, to
stand with Cockneys while they salvaged their sticks of furniture from
the ruins . . . the royal houses were searched for spare beds and
clothes; the rationing of fuel was so strict that official visitors to
Windsor found their bathwater restricted to a depth of five inches. The
Queen went among the people and reminded them of the more enduring,
gentle aspects of the nation's life. She led the women in their tasks of
compassion. And the nation paid her the compliment which is so typically
English and affectionate: they hung her portrait in their pubs and
village halls.''
But barely five years after that encomium a questioning tone was
entering national discussion on the royals. In 1957 Lord Altrincham
wrote, in a small-circulation magazine, that the monarchy ''lamentably
failed to live with the times''. For his audacity he was publicly
slapped in the face and excrement was pushed through his letterbox.
That same year Malcolm Muggeridge observed that our secular society's
nonsensical adulation of the Windsors had turned its members into actors
in ''a soap opera''. Muggeridge was the first to use that phrase about
the family and his punishment was even more vicious than Altrincham's.
His letterbox was fouled but his house was also vandalised, his life
threatened, and his journalistic contracts, with newspapers and the BBC,
ripped up.
He was spat on in the street, and among his hate mail, there were
letters expressing pleasure at the death of his son who had been killed
in an accident. Royalist worship clearly contained a primal rage.
Nonetheless, it wasn't long before homage itself nose-dived, for in
the egalitarian Sixties the royals did appear frumpishly out of touch
with the new raciness of Swinging Britain. And that was very much the
way of it until, at the Queen Mother's encouragement, Lady Diana Spencer
passed through the portals of insufferable protocol as consort to Prince
Charles.
Diana was the grandchild of one of the Queen Mother's closest friends,
Ruth, Lady Fermoy, and popular belief has it that the two old ladies set
about their match-making when it became obvious that the Prince of Wales
could delay no longer in choosing a wife.
But from the start, some say, Lady Fermoy herself had worries about a
misalliance. However, in Diana the Crown had found not just the required
sexual innocent but a symbol of modernity. What it eventually got was
the virgin who refused to be sacrificial, and that wretched marriage is
perhaps the Queen Mother's only public mistake.
She was 82 at the time of the wedding, and no doubt possessed an
elderly incomprehension about the very fundamental shifts in British
life. Infidelity might not have shocked her since that has always been a
sophisticated, upper-crust deceit. But the open independence of
contemporary womanhood was something completely alien to her generation.
The Queen Mother's particular insistence on duty had been paramount in
Princess Margaret's decision not to marry the handsome and gallant
divorce, Peter Townsend, and, as things worsened in the Wales's
marriage, she might have thought her influence would be equally
effective in taming Diana. It wasn't, with the result that an old queen
and a future queen allegedly came to detest each other.
Yet there they are, the two most popular royals: an estranged
princess, beautiful but doomed; a dowager monarch, the charming,
make-believe granny of the people. To be robbed of these talismanic
figures is, for some, to leave Britain curiously defenceless.
Not long ago Richard Ingrams, the founder of Private Eye, observed
that: ''The Queen Mother is popular because she kept out of it all.
She's never said anything remotely controversial. She's probably a
dreadful old bag, but everybody loves her.'' Certainly, few think less
of her for being a philistine. Some years ago affection for her only
increased when the novelist and biographer A N Wilson caddishly
published an account of her dinner-table conversation with him:
Queen Mother: We had this rather lugubrious man in a suit, and he read
a poem . . . I think it was called The Desert, and first the girls got
the giggles, and then I did, and then even the King.
Wilson: The Desert, ma'am? Are you sure it wasn't called The
Wasteland?
Queen Mother: That's it. I'm afraid we all giggled. Such a gloomy man,
looked as though he worked in a bank, and we didn't understand a word.
Wilson: I believe he did once work in a bank.
In 1989 fury surfaced once again when Alison Watt's canvas of the
Queen  Mother, hatless with a teacup by her side, was condemned as
disrespectful. It had been commissioned for the National Portrait
Gallery and on sight of it the trustees shivered with disdain.
The art critic Brian Sewell dismissed it as nothing remotely like its
subject, but what the Glaswegian painter had captured was the essential
Scottishness of the sitter's character. This wasn't some festooned
octogenarian on her way to Ascot, but a strong-minded woman with every
appearance of still ruling her family. A woman with powerful hands,
which appear unringed in the painting, and the kind of solid frame
indicating a robust constitution.
Yet, whatever anger the portrait caused, the model at least appeared
to like it, privately expressing her delight at its realism and absence
of royal cliches.
Last year, at this time, the royal birthday photograph itself stirred
more outrage by its marked contrast to the fondant focus of so many
formal snaps. As if the matriarch herself now thought it wise to
demystify the tribe, the Queen Mother chose Lord Snowdon's black and
white study, knowing it showed her still grand and to the manor born but
also frail and vulnerable, the fatigue in her eyes hardly concealed by
the veil on her Edwardian hat.
But there was something different, too, about that hat. In the
iconography of royal portraits the Queen Mother's millinery represents
the closest thing to a halo in a godless culture. For generations it has
been the same, the upturned brim conveying a certain tilted optimism.
Now, the chosen hat, a feathered cartwheel worn to the side as usual,
featured the brim cast down. Everything about that picture defined the
fragility of age, which made it a courageous revelation and far more
honest than most ceremonial images released by the royal household. Yet
again, though, its reality was shouted down as shocking, and we can be
sure that this year's portrait will make amends by reverting to the old
kitschy formula of saccharine and light.
The special tyranny, then, of being royal is that by any public
admission of human frailty, they are undone. And what that says about us
may, in the end, be more depressing than what it says of them. We are
their subjects, but in return they must be faithful to their smiling
obligations. It is as absurd as as any pantomime, yet still a pantomime
most Britons feel unable to surrender.

A HOSPITAL was accused yesterday of disposing illegally of
bloodstained items, including a piece of human body.
Glasgow Royal Infirmary faces a total of 30 charges alleging the
method of disposal was likely to cause environmental pollution and harm
to human health.
The hospital denied all the charges at Glasgow Sheriff Court and trial
was fixed for November 28.
It is alleged that items were sent to the UK Waste Management premises
in Pinkston Road, Sighthill, Glasgow, between January and March this
year without proper descriptions.
The items are said to include a piece of human tissue, blood-stained
bandages, used syringes, prescription drugs, swabs, hair-clippings, and
blood-stained hospital attire and equipment.
The prosecution has been brought under legislation that stipulates
such articles should not be used as land-fill but should be incinerated.

A LITTLE bit of America has gone on sale to Scottish home hunters at
bargain prices.
Less than a week after the United States Navy announced it was pulling
out of its Edzell base, some of the purpose-built houses in Brechin in
which the servicemen stay have been advertised on the market as the
''opportunity of a lifetime''.
The houses are being sold at fixed prices and a four-bedroom detached
house valued at #75,000 can be bought for #65,000. A two-bedroom semi
will cost #35,000, a saving on the valuation of #7000.
Yesterday, Messrs Ferguson and Will, the Brechin solicitors and estate
agents who are handling the sale of the properties were inundated with
calls and Mr Ian McFatridge said he was very pleased with the initial
response.
According to the sellers of the 20-year-old two, three and
four-bedroom houses, they were built to the high standard and stringent
specifications demanded by the US Navy and, for example, have larger
rooms than typical British homes and have built-in wardrobes in all
bedrooms.
With the occupants changing every two or three years, they have also
been maintained to a very high standard.
Mr McFatridge said that initially there are around 20 houses vacant
but a deposit would secure a house now for purchase in 1996.
In total, there would be 82 houses for sale by the time the Navy
departed in September 1997.
''It is a question of first come, first served,'' said Mr McFatridge.
''We have had a large number of inquiries and are opening showhouses
this weekend to which several people have said they will come.
''Most inquiries so far have come from individuals but I understand
that, in similar situations, speculators have bought houses and kept
them for nine or 10 months until the price rises again and then sell for
a profit.''
* A HISTORIC Scottish castle, once the property of a notorious wizard
laird, is for sale at a knockdown #200,000.
Prospective buyers for Skene House, near Aberdeen, could also stand to
inherit the title of Baron Skene, left vacant since the early nineteenth
century, when the family were wiped out by a curse.
The most infamous ancestor to live at Skene House was Alexander, the
16th Baron (1680-1724), known in Scottish folklore as the Wizard Laird.
Born in 1665, Skene was said to have studied the art of black magic
for seven years at a school at Padua, northern Italy, said to have been
run by the Devil.

SPECIALLY trained police officers were comforting the family of
seven-year-old Sophie Hook last night as they sought to uncover vital
information in the hunt for her killer.
Officers were with the Hook family at their home in Cheshire as
detectives were granted a further extension until tomorrow to question a
man about the brutal murder in the north Wales seaside resort of
Llandudno.
The young local man appeared before magistrates for a second time in
two days. It is thought police may want to hold him while they
investigate leads from the hundreds of phone calls from the public about
the shocking murder.
It is believed the children with whom Sophie was camping -- sister
Jemma and cousin Luke, both aged nine -- in Luke's father's garden
before she was sexually assaulted and strangled, may hold the key to the
murder.
The children of both families know that little Sophie, whose naked
body was found on a beach half a mile from the garden on Sunday morning,
is dead.
''All the children know that Sophie has gone to heaven,'' said
Inspector Loraine Johnson, who is in charge of the team offering the
close-knit families support and comfort as they struggle to come to
terms with the killing.
''Jemma is aware that her sister has died. Jemma is a very bright
little girl. It is quite obvious she is traumatised.''
Inspector Johnson, head of the inter-agency unit of the North Wales
Police community liaison department since its inception in 1988, said
the children had already been gently interviewed at a special
semi-detached house in Colwyn Bay set up to resemble a normal home but
with hidden video-taping facilities.
It was now a matter of offering the families every support and
practical assistance and gaining the trust of the children in the hope
of uncovering any information that could be useful.
''They are assisting us but we are going very, very gently,'' she
said.
Sophie's uncle and aunt, Danny and Fiona Jones, from whose back garden
she was either lured or snatched, were ''very, very distressed'',
Inspector Johnson added.
''The family are a very close family. They are gaining support from
one another but self-blame is a natural process of grief -- all members
feel they are in some way blameworthy.''
Meanwhile, police were asking hoteliers at Llandudno to compile lists
of last weekend's guests. It is believed they are also awaiting the
results of forensic tests on items from the house where she had been
staying, and the murder scene.
Officers were also with the Jones family at their Llandudno home --
Sophie had been visiting her cousin Luke on his ninth birthday and his
parents had bought him the tent as a present.
They agreed to let the children camp out but the fourth child, Luke's
brother Alex, six, had gone back inside at about midnight leaving
Sophie, Jemma, and Luke.
Mr Jones had checked on them, the last time Sophie was seen alive
before her body was found on Sunday morning by a paddling pool on the
beach.
Detective Superintendent Eric Jones, leading the 60-strong team of
officers investigating the murder, said the man being held was local --
he is not believed to be connected to the families..
A second man, also arrested on Monday, was released on police bail
yesterday.
Mr Jones said police were considering contacting experts to produce a
psychological profile of the killer to aid the inquiry.
He also disclosed that Sophie's pants had been recovered on Sunday and
had been sent for forensic tests, including DNA tests.
He said hundreds of people had responded to Mr and Mrs Cook's
emotional appeal to the public and with thousands of holidaymakers in
the resort over the weekend calls had come from all over the country.
He appealed to the public and specifically local householders to help
find Sophie's Pooh Bear nightdress and cream socks with little pink
flowers on them, which were still missing.
He admitted it was still ''a mystery'' whether Sophie wandered away
from the tent or was lured or snatched by her killer. He said many
people would have been in the area of the paddling pool and the
promenade between midnight and 7.15am when the body was found and he
appealed to them to come forward.
In particular, he said a man seen by the pool who then drove off in a
red Ford Sierra at about 1.30am should contact police so he could be
eliminated from the inquiry.
Police were continuing house-to-house inquiries and searches of the
area. Sophie's parents, Julie, 34, and Chris, 37, live in the village of
Budworth Heath, Cheshire. They also have a 21-month-old daughter, Ellie.
Inspector Johnson said the family had been down to the beach to
collect cards from the bouquets of flowers left by wellwishers to mark
the spot where Sophie's body was found.

<HEADLINE>Cook to tour Britain with policy roadshow amid warnings of back-bench opposition. Labour launches Euro campaign</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977092726</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday launched a campaign on a pro-European agenda in the
teeth of warnings from party Euro-sceptics.
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook claimed there would be little
dissent within Opposition ranks over his tour of Britain to promote A
People's Europe.
Party leaders hope the new agenda will knock spots off Tory
Euro-scepticism at the next General Election. However, Labour's own
Euro-sceptics voiced bitter objections to a single currency under the
terms of the Maastricht Treaty and demanded a referendum.
They claimed there was widespread opposition on the back benches to
the single currency plans, which one MP said would produce ''an economic
catastrophe''.
Mr Cook is to visit 10 cities in England, Scotland, and Wales this
month meeting business leaders, trade unionists, local authorities, and
newspaper editors to discuss party policies on Europe.
0 Unveiling the document, A People's Europe, at a Westminster news
conference, Mr Cook declared it was time for Britain to take a
constructive approach to the EU and attacked the Tories' negative
attitude.
The document spells out Labour policies on Europe in a bid to show how
advantageous the EU is to British people's lives but the Shadow Foreign
Secretary denied Labour would support a federal European superstate.
''The Europe we seek is an association of free member states sharing
common interests, not surrendering sovereignty,'' Mr Cook said.
''But we believe we get a better deal out of Europe for our people by
being part of the team rather than by standing on the sidelines.''
He produced a survey of Britain's top exporting companies which he
said showed the economic importance of Europe. The survey found firms
believed by a margin of two to one that they had benefited from
Britain's membership of the EU.
On single currency, Labour's new agenda said the party would sign up
only if British industry was able to compete effectively and there was
true economic convergence across Europe. However, it stressed this must
only be with the consent of the British people, gained through a General
Election or a referendum.
Llanelli Labour MP Denzil Davies said Mr Cook had ''ducked the issue''
on the single currency. He said: ''If we signed up to the Maastricht
criteria on a single currency, it would mean massive public expenditure
cuts. There would be broad opposition in the Labour Party to spending
cuts and to having to defer to a central European bank.''
Mr Alan Simpson, secretary of the left-wing Campaign Group of Labour
MPs, said: ''I am profoundly opposed to a single currency on the terms
that were set out in the Maastricht Treaty simply because it wouldn't
work and it would create a banker's Europe and forfeit 10 million jobs.
It would be an economic catastrophe.''
Other parties were swift to attack Labour's initiative. Foreign Office
Minister Jeremy Hanley said: ''Robin Cook is carrying out a totally
bogus exercise about our future in Europe.''
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said:
''Being positive about Europe takes more than warm words. People want to
hear clear statements.''

THE bodies of two workmen, trapped in the rubble of a collapsed office
block at Ashford, Middlesex, were found by firefighters early today.
Two of their workmates were killed instantly beneath tons of smashed
concrete and steel when the building they were demolishing collapsed
around them yesterday afternoon.
One other worker escaped death by inches when part of the office block
disintegrated in a cloud of dust.
Shocked labourers working on other parts of the building pulled at the
rubble with their bare hands in a futile attempt to save their mates.
Within minutes, fire and ambulance crews and police were at the scene
and a heavy crane was brought in to begin seaching for the trapped men.
One worker, Derek Butler, 46, a married man from Chertsey, Surrey,
said the gang of builders had just started work after lunch when one end
of the building collapsed.
Mr Butler said: ''You never know when a thing like that can happen and
you are that close to death. I had been blocking off a door when it went
with a huge roar.''
Mr Butler, his eyes red from weeping, had torn at the rubble with his
mates. His back was covered in blood from masonry that had fallen on
him.
One of those who died was the site agent, Mr Ron Martin, from
Portsmouth. The others have not yet been named.
Foreman bricklayer Dave Yewer, 45, said: ''We heard the building
collapsing. There was dust rising and we rushed round. I called to a
lady living nearby to ring for the ambulance and fire brigade and then
we tried to lift the rubble off but we could only get little bits. The
rest was too heavy.''
The accident happened about 2.30pm as the contractors began work in
sweltering heat on a new office block for the Ready Mixed Concrete
Company.
As frightened and bewildered men struggled helplessly to free their
friends, a local priest, Fr John Walsley, from St Hilda's Church nearby,
offered comfort to the men, calming them down so they could point the
rescue teams towards likely places where the buried men could be.
Fr Walsley said that one worker was devastated by the tragedy. He
said: ''He was full of anger and there as a lot of foul language, and he
kept asking why it had happened, but I managed to calm him down enough
to be able to direct the rescue teams.''
Firefighters used thermal imaging cameras, probes, and later police
dogs in the attempt to find the missing men.
Assistant divisional officer, Malcolm Parker, of Surrey Fire Brigade,
said: ''It has been a hot and arduous task. Very difficult and dangerous
for my men.''
The Health and Safety Executive will begin a full investigation into
the accident today when its inspectors plan to close the site. They will
be checking to see if there had been any breaches of building safety
regulations during the demolition work.

ALL the Department of Trade and Industry's oil and gas division jobs
should be transferred to the North-east of Scotland, SNP leader Alex
Salmond said yesterday.
Two years after a successful campaign by the Aberdeen community to
persuade the Government to transfer 60 key oil and gas policy jobs to
the city, Mr Salmond says there are currently more oil and gas Civil
Service jobs in Leicester than there are in the European oil capital.
He challenged the Scottish Secretary to bring about the transfer to
prove he is ''Scotland's man in the Cabinet'' rather than ''merely the
Tories' man in Scotland''.
Mr Salmond said: ''Since he became Secretary of State for Scotland,
Michael Forsyth has raised expectations by promising people more of a
say of their own affairs.
''After a month in his post, it is time for Michael Forsyth to move
beyond mere words and to start pledging tangible and specific benefits
to the people of Scotland.
''In the North-east of Scotland there is an overwhelming case for a
complete transfer of Department of Trade and Industry oil and gas
division jobs to Aberdeen.
''Incredibly, four years after a major Scottish Enterprise report on
the beneficial impact of jobs relocation to the North- east and two
years since the DTI oil and gas office opened in Aberdeen, there are
four times as many oil and gas division jobs in London than in Aberdeen.
Indeed, there are more oil and gas Civil Service jobs in Leicester than
in Aberdeen.''
He said that even the limited transfers which had taken place had been
won against deep-seated resistance from Ministers and Whitehall
mandarins.
''While the then Department of Energy used absurd assumptions in order
to argue that relocation would cost the public purse, the Scottish
Enterprise study showed that savings would be made by moving out of
London.
''Ludicrously, the Government built in the cost of staff travel and
subsistence for civil servants commuting to London for meetings with oil
company staff. The whole point of moving Civil Service jobs to Scotland
is the many thousands of high-quality jobs in geology, petroleum
engineering, and project development which will follow them.''
He referred to the Scottish Enterprise report of 1991 which suggested
that relocation of the oil jobs would be a big step towards attracting a
potential 15,000 private sector jobs to the area.
Grampian Regional Councillor Maureen Watt said: ''Aberdeen is entitled
to the benefits of having the highly paid, highly skilled private sector
jobs which would come in the wake of the complete transfer of oil and
gas division jobs to Aberdeen.
''The problem is that although Aberdeen is where the oil is, London is
where the power lies.''
Last night, Mr Forsyth responded: ''Mr Salmond should be looking to
discuss this matter in person rather than by a press release.
''I would be happy to meet with him should he wish to do so. The jobs
he refers to are Department of Trade and Industry civil servant posts,
of which there is already a significant presence in Aberdeen meeting its
customer needs. The oil industry remains a major source of employment in
Scotland.''

MORE holidaymakers in Scotland must be drawn from the home market, the
Federation of Small Businesses argued at a meeting with Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth in Edinburgh yesterday.
The delegation said there should be more effective marketing of
Scotland to attract tourists from throughout the UK.
The results of a tourism survey showed that this season was no better
than last.
However, members of the delegation expressed their confidence in the
Scottish Tourist Board to tackle the problems.
Mr Bill Anderson, FSB Scottish Secretary, said after the meeting that
it had been agreed to look again at the results at the end of the
season.
He added, however, that last season's drop in the number of tourists
-- six per cent, worth #130m in lost business -- had to be turned round.
On the matter of Scotland's rail services, Mr Anderson said Mr Forsyth
had taken a positive approach and it appeared the business initiative in
this area had succeeded.
Mr Forsyth told the federation that there would be joint marketing
efforts between the Scottish Tourist Board, Highland and Islands
Enterprise, Scottish Enterprise, and ScotRail.
The meeting also discussed the enterprise network and business rates,
and delegates reported they had gained the impression Mr Forsyth had
been well informed on these situations by Mr George Kynoch, Scottish
Office Minister for Trade and Industry.
Mr Jim Torrance, the federation's policy convener, said the meeting
was constructive and worthwhile, and the federation looked forward to
continued dialogue with Mr Forsyth.

VOTERS will take retribution on the Government at the next General
Election for selling off Britain's electricity companies scandalously
cheaply, according to Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian
Wilson.
The latest bid by Hanson values Eastern, only one of 12 regional
electricity companies in England and Wales, at #2300m -- almost half of
what the Government raised for selling all 12 companies five years ago.
Opposition MPs believe that this latest flurry of takeover activity
exposes the sham of the Government's claim at the time that it was
creating a share-owning democracy of millions of small shareholders.
The reality is that many people cashed in shares for quick profits,
and most shares are now in the hands of large institutional investors
and other companies.
Mr Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, said at his home in Glasgow
yesterday: ''I don't suppose it can be restated often enough. The whole
supposed success of the privatisation policy of the Government has been
based on selling off public assets at scandalously low evaluations. All
the boasts about the triumphs of privatisation have to be seen against
that background.
''For political reasons the Government ensured that every
privatisation from buses to power stations was a no-risk bet.''
The four bids so far, which have resoundingly awakened the sleepy
world of electricity distribution, have sharply underlined the
difference between what the companies are worth now, and what the
Government was willing to settle for five years ago.
The 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales are now
worth some #16000m -- more than three times their Government valuation.
It can, of course, be argued that it was only after privatisation that
the inspirational abilities of the management teams could be unfettered
in order to turn the companies into the successes they now are.
Mr Wilson said: ''I think the genius of private management has been
greatly overstated. Most of us could manage a successful business if we
were sold it at half its true value and then given licence to sack a
quarter of the staff.''
Although Ministers will argue that the spate of takeover bids,
including ScottishPower's #1000m bid for Manweb, should be settled by
the marketplace, they do pose some embarrassing problems for the
Government.
First, takeovers push up share prices, and consequenlty push up the
massive gains directors will make from their share options.
Secondly, any takeover often leads to job losses in future
rationalisations.
Thirdly, future price rises, no matter how deserved, often will be
blamed on the takeover, and fourthly, this apparent confirmation of a
serious undervaluation of the companies at the time of the sell-off
leaves the Government open to the accusation that it failed to gain the
best return for taxpayers which could have been spent, for instance, on
improving schools and hospitals
Attention now will turn to the Government-appointed regulator for the
industry, Professor Stephen Littlechild, who has the power to recommend
to the President of the Board of Trade that some, or all, of the bids
should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
He tried to do so with the original Trafalgar House bid for Northern
Electric which was subsequently withdrawn, and suspicious opposition
politicians are worried in case he believes he got his fingers burned
once and will not be willing to do so again.
Equally, Professor Littlechild has shown an independence of spirit in
the past, and may not be easily swayed by an earlier rebuff.
Mr Wilson is convinced such bids should be referred to the MMC.

<TEXT>
A POLITICAL row broke out yesterday over a landmark legal ruling that
Britain's employment laws discriminate against women.
The Court of Appeal in London decided on Monday that the law requiring
people to work for an employer for two years before they were entitled
to claim for unfair dismissal went against the principle of equal
treatment under European law.
It ruled that the requirement was discriminatory because fewer women
would qualify.
Thousands of women could now claim compensation from the Government of
up to #11,000 for loss of the right to sue for unfair dismissal.
As the Government considered yesterday whether to appeal, the defeated
Tory leadership contender, Mr John Redwood, and the Institute of
Directors were sharply critical of the decision.
Mr Redwood, an arch Euro-sceptic, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that
the Government must appeal ''as high and as far as it can'' against the
decision, which showed how difficult it was to maintain Britain's
opt-out from the Social Chapter ''in all its glory''.
Ms Ruth Lea, head of policy at the Institute of Directors, said the
ruling would increase the burden on business and have an adverse impact
on the employment of women in particular. ''It will harm the very people
it is intended to help.''
The Equal Opportunities Commission, however, welcomed the decision.
Chairwoman Kamlesh Bahl said: ''We particularly welcome the court's
unequivocal statement that new laws should be checked to ensure that
they do not discriminate unfairly against one sex.''

SCOTTISH solicitors expressed their anger yesterday that no settlement
had been offered north of the Border to victims of the dye Myodil,
despite an agreement by the dye's manufacturer, Glaxo Laboratories, to
pay #7m to claimants in England and Wales.
The English case -- one of the largest personal injury actions to come
before the courts -- was settled on Monday when Mr Daniel Brennan, QC,
told Mr Justice May in the High Court in London that Glaxo Laboratories
had, without any admission of liability, reached agreement with the
plaintiffs.
The settlement involved a payment of a lump sum of #7m which would be
distributed by the steering committee of the Myodil solicitors' group.
It was also agreed that the claimants' reasonable costs would be paid.
Mr Brennan said that, so far, 405 of the plaintiffs had accepted the
terms offered, nine had refused, and 12 remained to be contacted.
However, the Scottish solicitors' Myodil group said yesterday it was
extremely disappointed that no proposals had been made by Glaxo to the
65 claimants it represents in Scotland.
Mr Grant McCulloch, chairman of the Scottish solicitors' group, said:
''The group trusts that this is not another example of an English-based
company ignoring the suffering of its Scottish customers.
''The group will use all avenues open to it in Scotland to achieve the
best possible result for its clients.''
Last night, a spokesman for the Edinburgh law firm of Dundas &amp; Wilson,
which represents Glaxo, confirmed that the deal struck in the High Court
related only to England and Wales.
He said: ''I am awaiting instructions from Glaxo and can't comment
further.''
In England and Wales, more than 3600 people consulted lawyers,
claiming they suffered back pain as a result of being injected in the
spine with the dye Myodil during back scans.
In the multi-million pound damages action -- due to be tried this
October -- 426 plaintiffs had accused Glaxo Laboratories of negligence.
They alleged that the company failed properly to research, test, and
develop Myodil and continued to market the dye after it knew, or ought
to have known, that it was likely to cause injury.
Myodil was withdrawn in 1987 on the basis that it had been superseded
by other products.
Claimants alleged that, as a result of the use of Myodil, they
developed arachnoiditis, an inflammation of the arachnoid membrane
surrounding the spine. The nerves are damaged, causing severe pain in
the back and legs.

FORMER Maxwell finance director Robert Bunn, 47, is too ill to
continue to defend himself against fraud charges and an Old Bailey jury
was yesterday discharged from giving any verdict in his case.
Mr Bunn suffered a heart attack on July 21 and at first his medical
advisers considered he might be able to return to court at the end of
August.
Mr Justice Phillips told the jury on day 42 of the trial that new
medical evidence indicated that Mr Bunn could no longer undergo the
stress of continuing with his trial.
He added, however, that Mr Bunn's role in relation to material events
would have to be considered by the jury when they were asked to reach a
verdict against his co-defendants, Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, Mr
Maxwell'sbrother Ian, 39, and another former Maxwell aide, Mr Larry
Trachtenberg, 42. All have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to defraud.
The prosecution alleges they misused pension fund investments to prop
up the debt-plagued Maxwell empire.

A WOMAN has found her young nephew stabbed to death in his home,
police said yesterday.
A kitchen knife was found close to the body of Mr Simon Purdy, 25, who
had lived at the isolated country house in Orchard Lane, Boars Hill,
Oxford, with his brother, Robert.
A post-mortem examination revealed the part-time student at North
Oxford college had died from a single wound to the chest.
Detective Superintendent David Blair, who is now heading the murder
inquiry, told an Oxford news conference that Mr Purdy's aunt, Ms Jean
Purdy, who lives close by, found her nephew's body during a routine
visit on Monday morning.
He was unable to say whether there had been a break-in at the house
but said there were no obvious signs of forced entry.
He added that Mr Purdy's brother had been away from home, serving with
the navy. The brothers inherited the house after their father died about
two months ago.

EXCLUSIVE
A PIONEERING #10m housing development in Lanarkshire has been left as
an empty black scar on the environment after the collapse of a Glasgow
property company.
The costs of removing a 20ft-deep peat bog and problems posed by a
complex of old coal workings forced Hanirose Homes of Thornliebank to
abandon an innovative housing estate near Airdrie and plunged the
company into official receivership.
Receivers Touche Ross and agents Euan Wallace are now struggling to
overcome the ground problems which crippled Hanirose and find a buyer
for the site at Wattston.
More than 40 families have lost deposits paid on the new homes as the
building company failed to register the site for an NHBC guarantee,
while creditors fear they will get little return on debts mounting to
tens of thousands of pounds.
However, while residents in the old village of Wattston claim they
knew of the ground problems all along, the collapse of Hanirose Homes
came as a shock after a high-profile marketing launch of its 140 home
village in January this year.
Sales exceeded #4m in the first 10 weeks of the company's Sherlock
Park development with the first phase sold out, more than 250 inquiries
for the first 15 homes and reservations taken on the second phase.
Hanirose Homes, a company with a track record of just one year in
property development, boasted that the new scheme of mixed housing with
prices ranging from less than #50,000 to more than #100,000 was a
groundbreaking initiative with design based on 1930s Scottish
architecture.
The company's only previous development was of luxury two-bedroomed
flats at Fotheringay Court in Pollokshields.
The extravagant estate at Wattston would have had a nursery, adventure
playground, social centre, fountains, tree-lined avenues, and
traffic-calming measures, with #250,000 worth of features returned to
the community from development profits.
However, sandwiched between a landfill site and peat bog, and
underscored by dozens of old mine workings, the development appeared
doomed from the outset. Three property developers had previously sold
the site on -- one going bankrupt in the process.
Problems began early for Hanirose Homes -- a family owned company run
by Mr Hamani Hanif.
Initially, Mr Hanif gave the task of removing vast quantities of peat
discovered beneath the topsoil on the site to a sub-contractor at a
fixed-price contract basis.
However, the peat-bed was larger than had been calculated by test
boring -- running to 20ft in depth in some places -- and its removal
proved both difficult and costly.
When the subcontractor fell behind schedule on its fixed- price
contract it went into liquidation and Hanirose took on the task itself.
However, it was the cost of replacing the hundreds of cubic metres of
peat with a foundation infill which crippled the company.
Liverpool-based Caird Environmental which contracted tipping
facilities at its neighbouring landfill site, last night said it was
owed ''tens of thousands'' by a Hanirose subsidiary company and was not
optimistic that its debt would be repaid.
Mr Euan Wallace of Glasgow estate agents Euan Wallace and Partners
said his own firm had been asked by receivers Touche Ross to give
development advice and to field queries from anxious home buyers who had
paid deposits of between #100 and #250.
''It's early days to say what will happen to what amounts to 3.6 acres
of the 11-acre site as there are underlying ground difficulties which
will have to be overcome before a decision can be made,'' he said.
''If we can resolve the groundworks, the development could still be
continued, but maybe not to the 140 homes originally envisaged.
''We are also unclear whether the prices at which the homes were to be
built and sold will remain at the figures they were originally
advertised,'' he added.
The site has now been abandoned, with fly tipping already making the
scar of peat appear like a scene from ''Beirut at its worst'', observed
Mr Wallace.
The chance of the development's eventual success has been further
hampered by the discovery of a network of old mine workings at the
eastern end of the site.
Last night, a spokesman for Touche Ross would say only that all
creditors of Hanirose Homes had been circulated and had no other comment
to make.
Mr Hanif, who is seriously ill, was not available to comment but close
sources say he is ''shell-shocked'' by his company's collapse.

<HEADLINE>Appeal court doubles sentence of driver who killed two cyclists</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977092737</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DRINK-driver who killed two cyclists had his jail sentence increased
from two years to four and a half by the Appeal Court in London
yesterday.
Derek Sylvester, 33, of Chapel Lane, Navenby, near Lincoln, also had a
driving ban extended from four years to seven.
He had been jailed and banned by Judge Richard Benson at Lincoln Crown
Court on April 28 after pleading guilty to causing the deaths of Michael
Wharmby, 17, and Carl Rutter, 21, by driving without due care and
attention on September 4 last year, after consuming alcohol above the
prescribed limit.
His sentence was referred to the Appeal Court by the Attorney General
as being unduly lenient.
Lord Justice Rose announced yesterday: ''We are satisfied the sentence
was unduly lenient.
''The court is wholly unable to accept that the judge's comment about
'momentary carelessness' was an accurate description of the accident.
''Aggravating features were the high degree of carelessness in failing
to see the cyclists; driving away from the accident and delay in calling
emergency services; and seeking to blame his wife.
''And he had previous convictions in May 1988 for driving with excess
alcohol, for which he was fined #100 and disqualified for a year, and in
1991 for speeding.
''Mitigation was his plea of guilty.''
Lord Justice Rose said the accident occurred at about midnight on the
A607 between Lincoln and Grantham as Sylvester approached his home after
a 90-mile round trip to Scunthorpe, before which he had drunk two pints
of beer and five whiskies in a Navenby pub crawl.
The two victims were cycling in the same direction as Sylvester. Both
their machines had rear reflectors, Wharmby's had a single rear light,
Rutter's a conventional light and a pulsating one, and they must have
been visible for 80 metres.
Sylvester's car hit them and one impact to its roof caused the
windscreen to shatter. The victims' bodies were left 40 metres beyond
the first impact point.
Sylvester drove home, telephoned police and said his wife had just
returned from Scunthorpe and had collided with a bicycle on the village
outskirts.
When he returned to the accident scene, he told police he had been in
the car but his wife had been driving. But he later admitted he had been
the driver after his wife denied his allegation.
He lied about the amount he had drunk but roadside and police station
breath tests proved positive.
His counsel, Mr Christopher Metcalfe, told the court: ''He has had
attacks on his house, wife and children and he has had a terrible time
in custody.
''He has been moved from one prison because he had ribs broken and he
is in another where he has suffered a broken nose.''
Sylvester waived his right to attend yesterday's hearing.
Mr Rutter's mother, Lorraine Clark, of Navenby, was delighted by the
result of the appeal.
She said: ''That is far better than we expected. We didn't want to
build our hopes up at all after what happened last time. We didn't want
to be disappointed again. But this is far more realistic.
''However, the maximum sentence for this sort of crime is 20 years. It
would be interesting to know just what you would have to do to get the
maximum sentence.''
Mrs Clark, 38, a care assistant, said she hoped the increased sentence
would act as a deterrent against drink-driving.
''Nothing could ever, ever bring the two boys back. All we could hope
for was a deterrent to stop other families going through what we have
gone through. Two years for two lives just wasn't that.
''Now people might think a little bit harder before they get in their
cars to drive when they have been drinking.''
Michael Wharmby's mother, Jean, 47, said: ''It has got to be an
improvement and it has gone a little way towards getting some sort of
justice.''

BRITAIN'S #5000m frigate programme for the 21st century is in danger
of falling years behind schedule with soaring costs, it was disclosed
last night.
The project is vitally important to Clydeside shipbuilders Yarrow
which is expected to be the lead yard for the contract when it
transpires. However, defence sources fear the entire project could face
collapse.
The Royal Navy's share of the deal would have been 12 warships. Yarrow
were guaranteed to build the first ship because of their involvement in
the design and therafter would have tendered with other companies for
the remaining 11.
The new vessel, being developed by Britain, France, and Italy, is due
to replace the Navy's Type 42 destroyers to provide air defence for
maritime operations.
Curiously, the proposed in-service date, which has been classified,
was revealed today in a report by the National Audit Office as 2002.
However, the report warned this date was obviously ''overly
optimistic''.
The next phase in the development programme was originally due to be
signed in March. It was then delayed until July and is not now scheduled
to be signed until the autumn.
Ministry of Defence officials admitted that discussions were already
under way with France and Italy in a bid to determine a more realistic
in-service date.
The contract is vitally important to the future of Yarrow
Shipbuilders. The company has already had to diversify because of
slippage in Government defence contracts and has being going for
overseas work recently, including an order from the Malaysian
Government.
A defence industry expert said: ''Yarrow is very realistic about these
things and know to expect slippage. It will be disappointing for it,
however.''
An earlier project to develop a Nato frigate during the 1980s failed
because it was impossible to harmonise national requirements and
timescales between many partners.
The Audit Office report warned there was a real danger of soaring
costs because of each of the three partner countries seeking to secure a
large percentage of the work.
''It is essential industry and the collaborative partners work
together to ensure work share arrangements are addressed at the broadest
level so that a pragmatic mechanism which recognises the political
realities and achieves value for money is agreed,'' it added.
Nobody could be contacted for comment from Yarrow last night.

<TEXT>
A TEENAGER suspected of stealing sunglasses plunged to his death over
a 100ft cliff, apparently trying to evade capture, police said
yesterday.
The incident happened at the same spot where two men died in a chase
12 years ago.
All three deaths happened in Newquay, Cornwall, when the victims
jumped over a wall with a sheer drop to the beach on the other side.
The latest tragedy happened when 18-year-old Ben Shepherd Read was
believed to have taken a pair of sunglasses from the Ocean Magic surf
shop in the resort on Monday evening.
Mr Read, from Sevenoaks, Kent, was chased for around 100 yards by a
member of the shop staff along the resort's Cliff Road.
Police said he ran through the car park and grounds of the Beachcroft
Hotel.
He climbed a wall which separates the property from the cliff, and
plunged to the beach below.
The youngster fell into a small inlet, so holidaymakers knew nothing
of the tragedy until a Royal Navy helicopter arrived to airlift his
body.
A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said: ''If you think someone has
got something from your shop you go after him.''
He added that anyone not knowing the area would not realise there was
a drop beyond the wall.
Two other men died at the same spot in 1983 as they were being chased
by a gang and jumped the same wall in a bid to escape. Two other men
clung to the cliffs and were rescued.

<HEADLINE>Hospice offers to look after brain-damaged boy for life</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977092740</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A BRAIN-damaged boy, whose parents are fighting a legal battle for him
to be allowed to die, was yesterday offered lifelong care by a hospice
for babies in Liverpool.
Zoe's Place, a six-cot hospice founded in February by the Life
anti-abortion campaign, said it can give a permanent place and 24-hour
care to Thomas Creedon.
The hospice's offer was made to the Official Solicitor, who represents
Thomas's interests in court, and the President of the High Court Family
Division, not to the child's parents.
Removing Thomas's drip-feed and allowing him to waste away and die
under sedation, as his parents wish, would amount to ''having him
legally starved to death'', said the hospice.
A judge gave approval on Monday for Thomas's parents, Con and Fiona,
to apply for him to be made a ward of court. This was the first step in
the legal process to decide his future.
The 22-month-old boy was brain-damaged in the womb and cannot hear,
see or control his movements.
His parents say he is in constant pain and have described the
drip-feeding which keeps him alive as ''barbaric''.
But a spokesman for the Life Hospital Trust, which runs the hospice,
said: ''We will look after him for the rest of his natural life and
treat him with love and respect.
''The media say Tom is going to be 'allowed to die'. If someone is
deliberately refused nourishment, he is not being allowed to die. He is
being deliberately put to death.
''Death by starvation and dehydration is a slow, awful agony. How can
anyone who loves that boy wish such a fate for him?''
Life research officer Peter Garrett said it was unclear whether the
parents' permission would be needed for Tom to enter the hospice.
He added: ''Overtures to the parents can only be made very gently. We
hope they will be made aware of the offer indirectly and we would then
be happy for them to contact us.''
A similar offer was made two weeks ago to brain-damaged two-year-old
Ian Stewart, whose parents Jim and Bronwen are also appealing for him to
be allowed to die, but Zoe's Place has received no response.
Mr and Mrs Creedon were unavailable for comment, but they have
previously suggested that they would not be happy to hand him over to
someone else's care.
The spokesman for Zoe's Place said the parents should not be allowed
to decide if their son's life is worth living or not.
He said: ''Tom is not a thing or a vegetable. He is a child with very
special needs. He is not the possession of his parents. He is a separate
human being for whom the parents have special responsibility.''

<RECORDNO>977092741</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO police officers came across a car resting on its roof in a corn
field and stuck a police aware sticker on the vehicle -- unaware that
the woman driver lay dead inside, an inquest was told yesterday.
The body of Mrs Sally Anne London, whose neck was broken, remained in
the car a further 24 hours while her frantic family searched in vain for
her.
Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner David Morris said the
two offficers had made an honest mistake.
He had heard that Mrs London's body was found only after the officers
put a note through her estranged husband Les's door saying: ''Could you
please remove your vehicle from the corn field or contact us to tell us
when and how it will be recovered.''
Mr London realised his 39-year-old wife could be in the car and within
minutes her body had been found, the inquest at Ampthill, Bedfordshire,
was told.
The court heard that between the sticker being placed on the car and
the discovery of the body, thieves had broken into the car and stolen
the stereo.
Mrs London, died from a broken neck when she crashed her car on May 16
near Ridgemont, Bedfordshire. Next morning, Constable Robert McGee and
Constable Shaun Timmons spotted the car, decided the driver had left the
scene and slapped a police aware sticker on it.
A further 24 hours were to pass before roadsweeper Shane Waplington
spotted the dead woman's arm hanging down inside the car. As he raised
the alarm, Mrs London's husband discovered the note telling him to
collect his car from the field.
The two officers, who originally spotted the car as they attended an
accident nearby on the morning of May 17, said they had not seen an arm
or any signs of a person being in the badly crushed wreckage.
Both policemen, who are now suspended, said they believed that the
driver had got out, shut the door, and left, intending to return the
next day.

A SCOTS MP yesterday dismissed the possibility that Rosyth Dockyard in
Fife would lose out on surface ship refitting as the result of a strong
lobby by Conservative MPs in the South of England.
Mr John Home Robertson, who represents East Lothian, and is a member
of the Defence Select Committee, was speaking after the publication of a
committee report which recommended that it was essential for decisions
on the future of the Royal dockyards to be based on genuine assessment
of the way in which refits and repair facilities could be provided,
rather than the pursuit of pre-determined policy options.
He said yesterday that he was happy with the report, and felt that
there was no threat to Rosyth.
''It was promised the programme of surface refitting work by the
previous Defence Secretary, and that is binding,'' he said.
He added: ''Clearly, there is a strong lobby in the south which would
like to see Rosyth's allocation placed elsewhere, but that would be
outrageous.
''My Labour colleagues and I intend to monitor the situation closely,
although Rosyth is coping well, and even attracting additional work.''
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that six offers have been received
from companies interested in taking over the running of Rosyth Naval
Base, which is scheduled to close next April.
No details about the bidders were being released by Edinburgh property
company, Ryden, which is handling the sale for the Ministry of Defence.
Managing partner, Mr Roy Durie, said that the MoD would probably short
list the bidders to three, making a decision by the end of August.
''The response has been encouraging, demonstrating that the site could
become a future maritime business park,'' he said.
The Ministry's land agents would then become involved in negotiations,
although it was possible that Procurement Minister, Mr James Arbuthnot,
MP for Wanstead and Woodford, could become personally involved in
speaking to those on the final short-leet.
Yesterday, the recently appointed Minister visited the base, and had
talks with management and union officials at the adjoining dockyard,
managed by Babcock Defence Ltd., for the MoD.
Later he said he recognised the importance of the situation facing
Rosyth, and would be making his decision in due course.
Babcock management, part of the consortium Rosyth 2000, which includes
Forth Ports Authority, the Bank of Scotland, and ScottishPower have said
they are interested in taking over the navy base, using it as an
integrated industrial site. Clydeport is also strongly rumoured to be
interested.

CELTIC Football Club has been granted permission by Glasgow District
Council to use a street behind its stadium for access to the ground,
despite strong opposition from local residents.
The decision clears the way for Strathclyde Regional Council to grant
a safety certificate on Friday for the full use of the club's new #18m
north stand, which will be opened officially at a pre-season friendly
with Newcastle United on Saturday.
Glasgow district's development control committee yesterday decided to
lift a restriction on planning permission granted for the club's new
26,000-seat stand last September which stated that Janefield Street must
not be used for access by spectators except in an emergency.
The granting of a safety certificate had been put in doubt when
Strathclyde Police expressed concern that using only a narrow path
called the Celtic Walkway, which runs roughly parallel to Janefield
Street and was Celtic's preferred access route for up to 13,000 fans,
could cause crowd safety problems.
This forced the club to return to the council in a bid to overturn the
condition that Janefield Street should not be used.
The development control committee, which met in private after a public
meeting with opponents and Celtic representatives, voted 10-2 in favour
of lifting the restriction.
However, the councillors insisted that the fenced Celtic Walkway
should be upgraded and that adequate safety lighting must be installed
along the walkway by June 1 next year.
Conservative Councillor Ian Thomas, who was one of the two committee
members who voted against the proposed amendment, alleged after the
hearing that four Labour councillors -- including council leader Pat
Lally -- were shareholders in Celtic and said they should have declared
an interest and should not have been able to vote on the issue.
Councillor Lally later confirmed he was a shareholder of Celtic but
said he had contacted the Town Clerk to ask whether that was a matter
that had to be declared at yesterday's meeting.
He said: ''The Town Clerk's advice was that we didn't have an interest
to declare in terms of the legislation.''
Councillors had visited the Janefield Street and Celtic Walkway sites
before returning to chambers to make the choice between public safety
and the amenity of local residents, who have campaigned vociferously
against the use of the street by football fans.
A group of residents, together with local children, demonstrated with
placards as the councillors inspected the site.
One community representative, Janefield Street resident Andy McGill,
said residents were continually plagued by fans urinating in gardens and
closes and dropping litter, while an ambulance had once been unable to
gain direct access to the street to attend to a sick resident.
Council leader Pat Lally said after the meeting that the committee
felt it had no alternative but to grant the access, adding that ''a
question was put to the police officer in charge of the area whether he
thought the committee would be irresponsible in rejecting his advice and
the answer was 'yes'.
''In the interests of public safety, the committee took the decision
that the condition should be rescinded.''
Councillor Lally said the committee was made aware of the fact that
Celtic would not have got a safety certificate for the new stand unless
Janefield Street was used.
A spokesman for Celtic said last night that the club was pleased that
''common sense had prevailed''.
However, Labour Councillor Elaine Smith, who represents a Bridgeton
ward and is not a member of the development control committee, reacted
angrily to the council decision and pledged that the campaign by
residents would continue.
''I think it is disgraceful for the people of Janefield Street having
to live in these conditions. In one vote, the quality of life of these
people has been reduced to virtually nil.''
Another Janefield Street resident, Mrs Rena McLaughlin, added: ''I'm
disgusted. The council and the club are all just interested in the
Celtic fans and not the residents. Celtic just want them in and out to
get their money and the councillors have sided with them and don't seem
to be bothered about the people they are supposed to represent.''
Strathclyde Police, who had maintained that the Celtic Walkway was
incapable of taking all 13,000 fans and would hinder their ability to
police fans and emergency services' access, said they were pleased with
the council's decision.

RANGERS Football Club yesterday banned the BBC from interviewing its
players and officials after the corporation screened film footage of
Paul Gascoigne's notorious flute mime.
BBC Scotland last night described the ban as ''deeply regrettable''
and made clear it would not tolerate any interference in its editorial
independence.
The move by Rangers followed Monday evening's Reporting Scotland,
which included brief highlights of the club's pre-season tournament at
Ibrox over the weekend.
It also showed the incident when Gascoigne, after scoring against
Steaua Bucharest on Saturday, celebrated by miming the actions of an
Orange flute-player.
His stunt, which has been criticised by Labour MP Mr George Foulkes,
received widespread coverage in newspapers thoughout the UK.
However, Rangers' decision to impose a ban appears to be motivated by
annoyance over the fact that the club itself supplied the footage to the
BBC.
It was filmed by the independent TV company, Cameron Williams, on
contract to Rangers. The club owns the copyright and the BBC paid a
relatively large fee to the club to show one minute of match highlights.
In a letter yesterday, club commercial manager Bob Reilly is
understood to have expressed displeasure at the inclusion of the
Gascoigne incident and indicated that interview facilities were being
withdrawn.
Mr Tim Luckhurst, BBC Scotland's editor of news programmes, said last
night: ''We were astonished to receive his letter. The footage was sold
to us by the club. At no stage did Rangers seek to impose any conditions
on our usage, nor would we have accepted any conditions.
''Paul Gascoigne's behaviour aroused a great deal of public interest.
Our reporting of the story went no further than most national
newspapers'.''
Mr Luckhurst said he hoped the matter could be resolved amicably, as
the BBC valued its relationship with Rangers, but added: ''We cannot and
will not accept any attempt to interfere without editorial
independence.''
Rangers' secretary Campbell Ogilvie was not available for comment last
night.

''A 36-YEAR-OLD man was charged last night with the murders of
schoolboys Robert Gee and Paul Barker. Police said Mr Steven Heaney, of
Eastham, Merseyside, would appear before Birkenhead magistrates today.
Robert, 12, and his best friend, Paul, 13, disappeared on Saturday
after they left their homes in Wirral, Merseyside, to go fishing in open
countryside about a mile away.
Their fathers carried out an unsuccessful search for them and alerted
police, who discovered their bodies on Sunday.
Officers arrested Mr Heaney on Monday and searched his bungalow home
less than half-a-mile from the field where the bodies were found.
Police said yesterday that a fisherman directed the youngsters to a
pond where their fishing gear was later found abandoned.
Earlier, police had been granted a 12-hour extension after Mr Heaney
had been in custody for 24 hours. Detectives obtained what is known as a
''superintendent's extension'' to allow further questioning, said a
Merseyside police spokeswoman.
Neighbours said Mr Heaney's father was become ill and had been taken
away by paramedics as police searched the house on Monday night.
Yesterday morning, Mr Heaney's mother left the house and is thought to
be staying with friends.
A neighbour described the parents as ''a smashing couple'', who have
another son, aged about 40, who lives in New Ferry, Merseyside. The
family had lived in the house for about 12 years.
According to the neighbour, the suspect was ''very, very quiet'' and
''self-contained''.

30.7C (87F), the highest since records began in 1951, and yesterday it
was 30.1C (86F), its second warmest recording.
Elsewhere, Dumfries reached 29.6C (84F) and Aviemore 28.9C (82F). The
temperature in Glasgow was 27.2C (81F).
Ayr experienced Scotland's only rain, a brief thunderstorm in
mid-afternoon, and Lerwick the coldest day, with a high of 17C (63F).
Yesterday, the Glasgow Centre forecast ''dry, bright conditions''
would continue over the weekend, though with temperatures easing to the
mid 20s.

Jamaican officials blamed the hurricane for a twin-engine plane crash
that killed five people. The Cessna 310 aircraft left Kingston bound for

THE Government's decision in October to withdraw freight subsidies
from Orkney and Shetland's ferry services was not one of the
recommendations made in a report by consultants hired by the Government.
Many islanders fear that the October decision will devastate their
economies.
The consultants suggested that the Government should consider a
publicly funded service, on similar lines to the west coast operation of
Caledonian MacBrayne.
However, the withdrawal of freight subsidies to Orkney and Shetland
was not recommended in the confidental report, which was prepared by
international accountants KPMG.
Not only did the Government decline to introduce a CalMac style
service, it specifically prohibited the publicly owned company from
tendering for the Northern Isles routes.
The revelations about freight subsidies brought about renewed calls
last night for Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to publish the report,
at least in summary form. It cost the public #137,500 and has been in St
Andrew's House since June of last year. On May 25, the Government stated
it would not publish any part of it.
The report was commissioned in May 1993.
In that financial year, CalMac received #7.1m in public subsidy to
operate 32 vessels of varying size, while the privately owned P&amp;O
received #8.613m to operate four vessels serving Orkney and Shetland.
In June last year, The Herald revealed that KPMG had concluded there
would be no economic or social benefit to be gained from privatising
CalMac. However, little was known about the Northern Isles Section of
the report.
On October 28, the then Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, announced
that CalMac would be staying in public ownership and that the subsidy
regime for the Northern Isles services would also change. This surprised
no-one but the way it was to be changed astonished most.
Under new arrangements, which would come in on May 1, a block grant
would secure passenger services and the transport of livestock to
markets. It would, however, be different for freight: ''I am satisfied
that the competition for the carriage of freight, other than exported
livestock, is such that subsidies are no longer necessary . . .''
There was outrage in Orkney and Shetland. Islanders are convinced that
P&amp;O's competitors, such as Orcargo and Streamline, would find it well
nigh impossible to carry on, and certainly not without rate increases.
P&amp;O would ultimately be left with a near monopoly which would lead to
even greater price increases.
Most assumed this had been one of the central KPMG recommendations.
According to Herald sources, however, KPMG made no such proposal.

''WE do hereby acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people
to determine the form of government best suited to their needs and do
hereby declare and pledge that in all our actions and deliberations
their interests shall be paramount.''
Perhaps not quite the Gettysburg address but still a pretty
uncompromising statement of the traditional Scottish constitutional
doctrine of popular sovereignty.
It was not, however, taken from an SNP manifesto but from a document
called the ''Chain of Right'', signed amid some considerable fanfare, by
every Scottish Labour MP in March 1989, with the sole exception of Tam
Dalyell who was allowed diplomatic leave.
This is quite recent history but it is useful to compare the ringing
statements of 1989 with the Blairite blur of 1995. Interviewed on
February 12 this year the Shadow Home Secretary, Jack Straw, put his
foot right in it: ''We would not be transferring sovereignty . . . Power
devolved is power retained . . . the Westminster Parliament would remain
sovereign . . . the powers could in theory be taken back.''
There is not so much a gap as a Grand Canyon between these two views
of Labour's proposals for Scotland. Therefore the only surprise in the
publicity of the past few days is that Labour's web of deceit has taken
so long to unravel.
There are two forces at work which mean that the Labour Party -- as
opposed to most Labour voters, many Labour activists, and even a few
Labour MPs -- cannot be trusted on the constitution.
First, there is the positioning of the Labour Party in Scotland. The
dominating force among the Labour leadership in Scotland is to concede
as little as possible to Scottish aspirations. This was once summed up
in a quotation attributed to Martin O'Neil that Labour's task was ''to
lower the aspirations of the Scottish people''.
It must be galling to the many genuine devolutionists in the
Constitutional Convention that Labour's leadership mind is only truly
concentrated by pressure from without rather than from within.
Labour leaders were panicked into radical constitutional commitments
in the immediate aftermath of the Govan by-election and ever since have
been gradually trying to prise their way on to safer ground.
What makes them more uncomfortable than anything else are the dangers
inherent in the assertion of sovereignty. On the same day as Jack Straw
was backing Westminster to rule OK, I was debating with George Robertson
in the Scottish parliament building in Edinburgh.
Among a number of revelations from George that evening was the
statement that he only campaigned for devolution because of his belief
that it would never lead to independence. This revelation rendered his
later failure to answer the celebrated Lorraine Mann question, asking
his second preference to devolution, redundant if still a tad foolish.
George is a conditional devolutionist. He will do as much as he deems
to be necessary to save the Union but no more. Whatever personal
affection he may have for a Scottish parliament it is saving the Union
rather than the ''interests of the Scottish people'' that is paramount
for Labour's Scottish spokesperson.
However, the real force placing Labour's plans under pressure has
nothing to do with Scotland. The prevailing winds in ''new'' Labour blow
from the south.
Blair's strategy for delivering Labour safely into power is now well
understood. Every potential Tory target must be moved and every Tory fox
shot. Clause Four, the minimum wage, tax plans, regional devolution in
England, women's short lists have all been kicked into touch in the
first half of this year. Why should the Scottish policy be any
different?
Of course there is an element of calculation involved. Blair must
weigh up potential English resentment against change with Scottish
resistance to no change. And that is why the overwhelming likelihood is
that there will not be a wholesale reversal of policy but rather a
trimming of the devolution sails.
Chief among these is again the question of sovereignty. In his
assertion of Westminster sovereignty Jack Straw actually quoted Enoch
Powell from the 1970s -- ''power devolved is power retained''.
He didn't however finish the quote. What Powell went on to say is
''that is precisely what makes it acceptable''. That is also precisely
the belief of Blair, Straw, and the sharp-suited clique surrounding the
London leadership.
If the Scottish parliament is clearly set under the thumb of
Westminster then it makes it less of a perceived threat and therefore
much less of a campaign target for the Tories come the election. It also
means less trouble from a Scottish parliament down the road if the lion
is well caged before the public is admitted.
There is an element of testing the water in all of this. The Scottish
reaction to the latest Labour slippage will determine how far the
process can be pushed before the election.
What might be interesting right now is for the lion to roar that the
cage door should be open not closed.

IAN McConnell writes about the ''popularity'' of Stagecoach (July 26).
We in this area use Stagecoach only because we have no choice. This
company has allegedly forced all competition off the road.
As for Mr Brian Souter's remarks -- new buses, improved services, and
lower fares are almost laughable! The address below is a small village
just outside Kilmarnock. Stagecoach's service to us, which we share with
a housing estate in town, is a minibus -- and what seems a rather
elderly one at that.
We've had a reduction in the service to four a day. The first bus in
the morning is at 10.45. As for lower fares -- ours increased from 90p
return to #1.30.
The area this service covers has an ageing population. On one day last
week we left Kilmarnock bus station with eight elderly people standing.
My understanding of the deregulation of buses was that it was meant to
break up the big monopolies. We've ended with even larger ones.

MR Pat O'Hanlon, the executive council member for the AEEU in
Scotland, has announced his support for the merger between ScottishPower
and Manweb (July 28).
When doing so he commented fulsomely on the company's ''positive
record in employee and union relations against a background of
industrial rationalisation'', following this with praise for the
company's ''enlightened'' personnel policies.
I doubt whether all ScottishPower employees, or Mr O'Hanlon's members
in the company, would be so approving.
Certainly not the ''blue collar'' electricians transferred from the
SSEB, following privatisation, to the newly formed Contracting Division
of ScottishPower.
The agreement presented to the employees with AEEU backing and active
support changed their working conditions drastically. It was, in effect,
a shotgun situation for the employees.
This transfer to SJIB conditions imposed reductions in hourly rates of
pay, withdrew the sick-pay benefit scheme, altered hours of work,
eliminated long-standing rest-day agreements, and will have an adverse
effect on long-term pension values. It also prepares the way for changes
in work-base locations.
It is difficult to see any sign of ''enlightened'' management or
''positive'' personnel policies here, unless Mr O'Hanlon considers that
the very short-term benefit of compensation covers the employees'
losses.
There is work for Mr O'Hanlon in ScottishPower Contracting Division
improving the conditions for his members, and not doing a ScottishPower
PR exercise.

PRIVATISATION of public utilities has led to the fallacious notion
that strict commercial practice should be slavishly followed.
Trade and industry maximise profit by every means, particularly
commodity price. But customers are free to shop around and companies are
forced to price accordingly.
With a utility, customers have no alternative to the asking price, so
profitability should allow for that. The rising profits of privatised
utilities reflect failure to meet this clear obligation, rather than
managerial skills.
Hitting the take-over and diversification trails is nothing less than
pseudo-entrepreneurial self-indulgence by senior management.
It would be more fitting if those concerns attended to their core
functions, the provision of safe and reliable services at low prices,
with the lower investment return offset by financial security.

ON July 30 Alistair Moffat of Scottish Television gave the Sabhal Mor
Ostaig lecture on Gaelic television and the preservation of Gaelic as a
living language. His message was a very gloomy one indeed. He said that
the view of Welsh academic experts was that Gaelic was finished and we
should give up.
I write about this with a great sense of urgency because in a recent
letter to you I took issue with Dr James Shaw Grant who argued in a long
piece that Highlanders should forget their terrible history and
concentrate on their computers in a campus-free University of the
Highlands and Islands.
Gaelic-free too, if Mr Moffat's analysis is right. But then, sitting
in front of their lonely VDUs, students wouldn't need to communicate at
all, except no doubt via the Internet.
I said in my letter that a University of the Highlands and Islands
should restore Highland history in full. Even more important would be to
restore the Gaelic language and culture, we have so much to learn.
Gaelic was once the language of all Scots for many centuries. The
language enshrines our deepest community instincts. It is not just the
language of the Gaeltachd. The vast majority of Scots and
English-speaking Scots are simply people whose ancestors at some stage
lost their original language under the pressure of English.
Scots contain hundreds of Gaelic words. The ''wee county'' in which I
live has a Gaelic name and nearly all the place-names in it are Gaelic.
Mr Moffat's aim of 100,000 Gaelic speakers by the end of the century
is a good one, but it will require a very well-organised campaign,
linking television with Gaelic language classes all over the country so
that everyone knows where they can get tuition.
Total residential immersion classes for people like me, a retired
university linguist, could quickly increase the number of teachers.
Finally, we have a great deal to learn from countries like Israel and
Finland where the national languages were brought back from near
extinction. The various organisations involved should study that
experience.

TELEFIOS must surely be the only news programme in a language other

MR David Thomson inquires why West Central Scotland always appears
scruffy (July 27).
We in this area would like to pose this question too. While
Helensburgh and adjacent areas, for example, continue to pay the council
tax to Dumbarton District Council (and it was hoisted this year not
insubstantially), we could cite the following as some of our less
favourite things:
A filthy foreshore; council houses the exterior of which seemingly
last saw painters when the gasometer, not tourist friendly, was erected;
an unsplendoured pavilion on the east bay; a recently constructed and
overdue public library, unbelievably unfurnished and unstocked; an
obscure and bewildering site on which stood the long unused outdoor
swimming-pool; and of course litter.
Didn't Mr Michael Forsyth say he will listen, following the example of
his re-elected Prime Minister? Well, here are some points for the
beginning of the feel-good factor too long absent, environmentally
anyhow.

IT was most refreshing to read Gavin Bell's column and to find that at
least one other person in Glasgow is lukewarm about the Burrell
Collection (July 26).
I would go one stage further and say that the general exterior
impression of the gallery is of an eyesore.
However, while I agree with Gavin Bell's concern about the various
plans for the city's parks, I must draw attention to an outstanding
success, namely the rose trial beds in Tollcross Park.
The semi-circular rose beds and intervening lawns are a credit to the
parks department both in their design and maintenance.
The colour and perfume are reminiscent of descriptions of famous rose
gardens of the past.

STATISTICS are wonderful. You doubt this? The merest glance at the
annual report of the Registrar General for Scotland should convince the
sceptic. It will never be a best seller, indeed it is possible that the
Registrar General and his staff harbour suspicions that few people
actually consult the result of their annual labours but, as was once
said erroneously of a certain Sunday newspaper, all human life is there.
The latest report has sad things to say about marriage in modern
Scotland, specifically the growing tendency to divorce and in particular
the 10,000 children who were affected by marital breakdown in 1994. It
has even more worrying things to say about births, which fell last year
to 61,656, the lowest since records became compulsory in 1885. The
reasons for this, apart from the fashionable worry about falling male
fertility, are unclear. It may be connected with more effective birth
control information, late marriages, and smaller families. Taken
together with the falling death rate in Scotland it speaks of a smaller
and ageing population. Scotland is not unique in this. Most developed
countries have an ageing population and this is frequently coupled with
a declining birth rate.
At this point statistics become not just interesting, but essential.
They are not compiled for intellectual exercise; their function is to
give information to the Government of the day on the most basic and
essential factors affecting the nation. Government should use this
information for forward planning, but this does not always happen,
especially when you have a Government which believes that market forces
will sort everything out. Combine this with short-term thinking and high
infant mortality for ministers in charge of important Government
departments and you have trouble.
To be specific, we have trouble. It is recognised widely that a
shrinking workforce will have to operate with exceptional efficiency in
the future to maintain an ageing nation. This is not an excuse for
ageism, but recognition that reports like that of the Registrar General
show us clearly that Scots must be better trained and educated now if
the future is to be sustainable. This goal is possible but we have scant
evidence that it is being prepared with anything like the care which it
deserves. Most educationalists, and many people who have raised
families, recognise that widespread and effective nursery education is
necessary to an educated nation. Even the Government realises this,
although belatedly, and thus we have the Department for Education and
Employment's proposal for a nursery education voucher scheme in England.
This is, if the latest information is correct, an unmitigated farce.
Apart from the dubious nature of voucher schemes, the measure bears all
the hallmarks of rushed and bungled thinking. The result is that the
Government's call for local authority volunteers in England has been
answered by only one Tory-controlled council. The rest are utterly
confused by Department of Environment threats to penalise them if they
fund vouchers, and hasty assurances from the Department for Education
and Employment that legislation would be brought in to allow the
necessary spending, but not for some time. The Liberal Democrats, who
are commendably serious about education, have advised their local
administrations to avoid the first phase of the new scheme and DfEE
officials have very little to say in response. None of this devalues the
need for more and better nursery education; what it points to is the
need for Government to bring forward proposals which can work. The need
is as urgent in Scotland as it is in England, and the necessary
proposals must be comprehensive and not subject to delay. Above all,
they must work.

MR John W Elliott is as entitled to his opinion of me (July 14) as I
hope I am of him and his viewpoint. But I know nothing of the man so
what can I say except that I stand by all that I have said and written
about Private Lee Clegg and his life, liberty, and stitched-up guilt --
as should any reasonable person interested in the substance of justice
rather than its shadow which seems to be Mr Elliott's only interest in
the matter.
As for Great Britain's vanished empire, yes, I do lament its passing,
the more so as coming events, the spectre of a major war this century,
continues to cast their shadow inexorably before us.
The world was mostly a more peaceable place when the Great Powers
ruled it. Benevolent despotism beats democracy, the source of more
murderous fracas than I care to think about, and I have experience of
both.
India, Pakistan, Kashmir, Bangladesh, and Burma, not to mention Sri
Lanka, once Ceylon, today ripped asunder with internecine strife, say
all that needs to be said about democracy. All was pretty peaceful under
the Raj and everyone had access to justice. Not any more, each country
spits hate across its frontiers.
As for the women, employees of the Crown who having rendered
themselves, knowingly, unavailable for duty as a result of having given
priority to childbirth and thereby incurred dismissal (and as a sop for
which they are now being massively compensated at the taxpayer's
expense), the mind boggles.
Yesterday, as in 1914 and 1939, to serve and if necessary to die for
Sovereign, Country, and Family was regarded as a privilege. Not any
more, if I understand Mr Elliott correctly service is simply a means of
bringing grist to the mill.
I am flattered, however, that my efforts should have put my critic in
mind of Cato the Elder, a very considerable public servant with many
valuable reforms in civic life to his credit, and some more
questionable.
I never got to Carthage but did get to its twin nearby, in Algeria
today, Timgad, where a fine triumphal arch commemorating the deeds of
Constantine the Great still stands.

A MODEST shareholder in Scottish Power, I have just returned from the
AGM only to read the article by Hamish Morrison exhorting Scottish Power
to get wired into Manweb.
Putting aside the rhetorical flourishes and saltire-waving most of
what is written makes sense but I do take strong exception to the
sentence ''short-term employment reductions would seem likely''.
This is double talk. Translated it means that there will almost
certainly be an increase in unemployment.
At present unemployment is the curse of industrialised Western Europe
and is no more acceptable whether it be in Chester and Liverpool or in
Glasgow.
Accordingly at a promised extraordinary general meeting I should voice
my displeasure at the proposed bid and given the opportunity would vote
against it.

IN writing of Zulu practice in relation to dead warriors Jim Craig
provides an interesting cultural dimension, albeit not one fully
appreciated by most West Europeans of the period (July 24).
Being familiar with the undertaker's practice of puncturing a grossly
distended stomach area with his screwdriver to allow ease of entry into
the coffin shell of a decaying corpse, I find the Zulu practice of
prompt disembowelment quite understandable; the ensuing stench is
absolutely appalling and endures interminably.
An addition to the list of Tshaka's martial innovations supplied by Mr
Craig was the heavy leaf-shaped assegai whose blade was forged into a
metal resembling steel.
Sharpened all round and fixed upon a hardwood shaft by a glue derived
from plant juice, it was finally secured in position by the tail of an
ox shrunk tightly over the join.
It was not a throwing spear but a well-balanced thrusting spear named
Ixwa from the sound it made when withdrawn from the body of its victim.
Tshaka's fighting method was to come to close grips with the enemy at
great speed overcoming opposition by discipline and the sheer aggressive
power of muscular manhood.
Sir Percy Fitzpatrick in his great classic of South African wild life,
Jock of the Bushveld, once a regular school prize, describes one such
remnant of Mr Craig's ''proud and downtrodden race''.
Debased, much addicted to drink, and often querulous, Jim Makokel's
latter-day fate as an expelled Zulu was to live and work among white men
under the then Boer Government of the Transvaal.
In appearance he belonged to another period and other conditions for,
wrote Fitzpatrick, ''he was simply a great passionate fighting savage,
the powerful bronzed limbs and body all alive with muscle, he had but
one argument and one answer to everything: Fight!''
Jim Makokel had fought at both Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift and
finally at Ulundi on July 4, 1879, where the might of Cetywayo, fourth
and last king of the ruling house of Tshaka was destroyed.
As at Rorke's Drift individual bravery at Isandlwana was not lacking
for Jim Makokel recalled one man dressed in blue, the last to die,
fighting with his back to a wagon wheel against scores before him and
how he fell at last stabbed in the back through the spokes by a single
Zulu who crept up from behind.
The hollow square and disciplined rifle fire at Ulundi may have broken
Zulu power but not the Zulu as a people. The captive Cetywayo was taken
to Capetown, but in 1882, with the support of Bishop Colenso and several
British newspapers who supported his restoration, he was allowed to
visit England.
Once there his dignified deportment created so favourable an opinion
that he was acclaimed by a sentimental public. Somewhat surprisingly he
was received in audience by Queen Victoria who plied him with gifts.
The following year Cetywayo was returned to a much reduced Zulu
Reserve with the undertaking not to raise an army.

THE Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
is telling us nothing new when it asserts that Britain's economic
recovery could be choked off by our growing skills shortage. This
country has fretted, without respite, about its relative failure to
invest in its future human capital, across the broad sweep of the
population, for the past 30 years or more. Worthy training White Papers
have come and gone. The political pages of countless newspapers are
littered with good ministerial intentions which died as quickly as the
print dried and the public spending implications were assessed. Seldom
has an issue been so exhaustively debated for so long to such little
effect.
We have, as the OECD report observes, far more people now staying on
in full-time education beyond 16 than was the case just five years ago.
But that is as much a reflection of the parlous state the labour market
has been in since the last recession as it is of a sudden resurgent
popular demand for meaningful applied education. Even in what passes for
economic recovery the spectre of how many of our children will earn a
sustained living as adults is one which continues to haunt parents right
across the social spectrum.
The dynamics of tertiary education in Britain today are as much about
the positive financial advantages to each institution of squeezing more
and more bums on to lecture room seats as they are about providing the
young -- and retrainable older generations -- with the fresh skills
needed to survive in the fast-changing world of work. Too much of the
ancillary training for the jobless, funded by agencies like Scottish
Enterprise, has been as much about massaging the unemployed claimant
count downwards as it has been about the genuine dissemination of
employable skills in the population at large. So this OECD report is a
timely reminder that much remains to be done if the skills deficit is to
be cracked once and for all.
Scotland in particular boasts a burgeoning electronics sector which
has replaced some of the lost output and lost jobs from our declining
traditional industries. But now, with the prospect of the latest major
inward investment project -- the proposed 2000 job Siemens semiconductor
wafer plant -- being lost to North-east England, there are allegations
from within the industry itself that Scotland is running out of the core
skills needed to attract more such investments here.
That charge merits some critical scrutiny. Locate in Scotland disputes
the claim. Its pitch for the Siemens project explicitly stated that,
with 7300 people employed in the semiconductor sector in Scotland, skill
shortages ''have not presented problems for incoming companies''. LIS
goes on to argue that the labour pool for the industry is now genuinely
UK-wide, if not European-wide. Recent adverts in Scotland for jobs in a
new wafer fab in Singapore would tend to suggest that the competitive
market for such skills stretches even wider than that.
That poses a deeper danger. It is that particular skills shortages
trigger more and more staff poaching as each new company arrives. That
could push up staff costs all round and, ultimately, render the UK, and
Scotland in particular, uncompetitive in the race to attract such
investment. If potential investors in Scotland are being deterred, for
whatever combination of these reasons, by what such companies identify
as local skills bottlenecks, here is an issue worthy of urgent attention
by our zealous and agenda-hungry new Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
There may even be more votes to be garnered in doing something about it
than are to be found in saving the West Highland sleeper service.

With the Scottish birthrate in decline, Jennifer Cunningham examines
the difficulties that face society with fewer children and an ageing
population
LIKE the trick mirrors in the fairground, the Registrar General's
annual bundle of statistics, reveals a likeness of how we might be, as
well as how we are. This year, he showed us a grizzled Auld Scotia 40
years hence.
We had the lowest number of births since registration became
compulsory 140 years ago, but also the lowest number of deaths. Between
1981 and 1994, the population of Scotland aged under 15 dropped by 13%
while the poulation aged over 75 increased by the same proportion. The
40-year projection from 1992 to 2032 shows the number of children under
16 rising slightly by the year 2001, when there will be 1,017,000 but
then falling to 912,000 (89% of 1992 level) by 2032.
The bad news for this summer's crop of job-seeking graduates and
school-leavers is that within their working lives fewer of them will be
supporting more old-age pensioners. The population of working age is
projected to fall to 86% of its 1992 level, while the number of men over
65 and women over 60 is expected to increase by 48% -- most of it
happening after 2011.
Should we be panicking? No, according to Isobel Lindsay, a Strathclyde
University sociologist, who believes that the problems of an ageing
population are often exaggerated. ''The problem about how the working
population is going to afford pensions for a large increase in the
number of retired people still has a considerable time to go. The answer
is that we have to start rethinking what is old age and what is middle
age. People are not only living longer, but more actively and more
healthily. If society needed labour, it could have people working longer
and still have at least as long a retirement as people did 40 years ago.
One small crumb of comfort may be that the projections assume a
different retirement age for men and women -- frankly unlikely after
about 2010. If the Registrar General's projections are borne out, the
population of Scotland, now 5,132,400, will be 5,143,000 in 2001, but is
expected to drop to 4,988,000 by 2032, 540,000 of whom will be 75 and
over compared with 326,000 in 1992.
''If we are looking at dependency rates, we have to take into account
not just older people, but also younger people,'' said Lindsay. ''All
children are expensive in terms of health services and maternity
services and of course education services are very expensive. The real
problem is the way that unemployment is distributed. A new policy would
need extensive planning and intervention. Everyone recognises there is a
problem but how should we get some people to give up a part of their
work and how should we distribute the resources. That is the central
problem. As long as old people in the population remain active for
longer and live longer, we do not have to panic about larger numbers of
the very old.
''In Scotland, the problem has been the migration of population, but
if we maintain our population and contain the migration problem, we have
the advantages of having a lot of land, a lot of space, and a lot of
water. There are advantages in not being over-populated,'' she said.
A forecast from the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys in
England earlier this year which showed that one in five women of
child-bearing age could expect not to have children compared with one in
10 of their mothers, has already set a number of hares running in all
directions. As well as the worried calculations about the future funding
of pensions and health-care for an ageing population, there is
increasing pressure for a re-examination of the true impact of the
current tax and benefits system on families.
The Family Policy Studies Centre is directing their research --
expected to be completed next year -- at the underlying reasons.
Ceridwen Roberts, the centre's director, said they are examining the
variations within the overall pattern of a drop in births.
They are conducting interviews with women coming to the end of their
reproductive lives in their late 30s and early 40s, divided into three
groups: married, single, and cohabiting with the aim of discovering why
they are childless.
''It may be that they never wanted to have children, or that they
wanted to have children but put it off and then found it difficult. The
nature of the choice of this generation of women is very different from
that of their mothers having babies in the 50s and 60s. ''We want to
know to what extent they want their lives to remain unfettered and to
what extent childlessness is the result of hard economic factors,'' she
added.
Roberts revealed that so far they had anecdotal evidence that people
feel they cannot afford to have children because of factors like
negative equity in the housing market and an increase in short-term
contracts, casual work, and self-employment.
The findings should produce real indications for policy makers as to
the effects of particular policies on reproductive choice. Already
sociologists have pointed out the obvious: that the birth rate is likely
to go down in times of economic uncertainty. It seems likely that
would-be parents put more personal factors into the equation but
population structure is the very nub of social policy and is where the
personal becomes political.
Roberts foresees intense political scrambling around the benefits
currently scattered to different family structures. ''If the birth rate
continues to fall, we will see a change in society, so that families
with young children become a minority of the population, although a
majority of the population will have gone through that stage. We may
then see political power moving. In the US we see the recognition of the
Grey Panther movement as a result of the number of votes held by the
old.
''The issue is if children are our future workforce, is society
investing sufficient in its 'stock' of children? For the past year or so
there has been a groundswell of opinion that families with children are
not getting a fair share of resources in the form of tax allowances,
with the right becoming vociferous that we are taxing 'normal families'
excessively because of the differential given to lone parents,'' she
said.
The Scottish statistics on live births bear out the idea that more
women are delaying having children until they have established either a
career, an economic base, or both. In 1990 there were 14,379 live births
to women aged between 30 and 34, 4143 to women aged between 35 and 39,
and 603 between 40 and 45. The numbers rose steadily in each of those
age groups, reaching 16,705, 5346, and 736 last year.
One of the questions the Family Policy Studies Centre researchers will
be asking their interviewees is whether their childlessness is due to
infertility discovered too late to make successful treatment a
reasonable option. Ceridwen Roberts believes that many women are not
sufficiently aware of the decrease in fertility levels in their 30s.
That in itself could result in a quick change in the statistical
pattern. In the past five years the number of births to young mothers
has also fallen consistently among both married and unmarried parents.
The number of babies born to teenage mums fell by 1300 and to women
between 20 and 24 by 4316.
At present the UK's birth rate (England's is not dropping quite so
clearly as Scotland's) sits in the middle of the European range -- with
Italy, Spain,  and Germany with the lowest rates and Ireland's showing
the most rapid fall.
So far the debate in Britain has got no further than scrapping over
child benefit versus tax allowances. Not only the commentators, but
future parents, would prefer the sort of debate which could establish
some real principles.

BERNIE Ecclestone, president of the motor racing Formula One
Constructors' Association, has been called the Napoleon of Grand Prix,
the Formula One Fixer, the Godfather of Formula One, and Mister
Motorsport. It is a galaxy of titles behind which hides a 65-year-old
man who arouses both admiration, envy, and fear in the world he
dominates.
As from yesterday he acquired fresh fame. According to the magazine
Labour Research he gave himself a pay rise in 1993, the last year for
which figures are available, of 1647% which put him top of the league
table of Britain's highest-paid company directors with a pay cheque of
#30m. This is #8m more than the man who came second, the pop singer,
Phil Collins -- #22.28m -- or Elton John, who came fourth with #17.94m.
It is three times as much as that Croesus of the musical theatre,
Cameron Mackintosh, who only just made the top 10 with #9.9m, and quite
puts Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, at number 11 with #7.6m, in the shade. It
is an achievement to boggle at.
But who is Bernie Ecclestone? A household word? Hardly, although he is
the eminence gris of his world. The names that the world knows are those
of the drivers he has helped -- through television -- to turn into
stars, rather than that of the star maker. He is said to be a benign
dictator, but motor sports journalists treat him with circumspection
because Bernie can ban. While officially the Paris-based Federation
Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), the sport's governing body,
issues accreditation, in reality it is said to be Bernie who has the
final say.
The 600-odd sports journalists who cover Formula One pay for their
passage through FOCA Travel, because if they do not they come up against
the fact that everywhere has been block-booked, all flights are full
with Foca Travel customers. He is not a man to be crossed, not a man who
courts publicity.
He is, however, the man who single handed transformed Formula One
racing from a contest for ''mates together'' -- his phrase -- into a
fantasy sport fuelled by millions of pounds from television, tobacco,
car makers, and consumer products sponsorship through his business
acumen.
His organisation, FOCA, represents the Williams, Benetton, and Ferrari
teams, among others, and has been responsible for bringing in the
sponsorship cash -- the cigarette company, Philip Morris, alone is said
to give around #60m a year -- and it is money well spent since Formula
One is the third-biggest televised sport in the world, after the Olympic
Games and the football World Cup. The sport's television audience is
said to number 45 billion in 143 countries, which compares with 31
billion for the World Cup and 16 billion for the Barcelona Olympics.
Said to be worth #200m, although he does not discuss money, his
headquarters are in a nine-storey building in Knightsbridge overlooking
Hyde Park which he bought from another man of mystery, Adnan Khashoggi,
for #7m. His moods are said to oscillate between vituperation and charm
and he is known -- to some -- as ''the poisonous dwarf''. He is, as well
as being a man who does not mince his words, a man of small stature who
favours white shirts, charcoal gray slacks, dark glasses -- his eyesight
is not good -- and a passe Beatles haircut when seen round the circuits.
But there are other views of him. According to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, who is numbered among his friends, he is a
''fun, exciting, unpredictable pocket dynamo'' and he is known to be
generous and compassionate to those the sport has injured and their
families. A family man, he has been married twice. He has a grown-up
daughter from his first marriage, and two, aged 11 and six, from his
second to Slavica, a Croatian model he met on the pit-lane wall.
Born 65 years ago this October in St Peter's, Suffolk, son of a
trawler captain turned engineer, he was brought up in the south London
suburb of Bexleyheath. He studied for a degree in chemical engineering,
which he did not complete, at Woolwich Polytechnic. At the age of 15 he
was already wheeling and dealing in second-hand bikes and duly went into
dealing in a big way, having discovered he was a natural.
By his mid-twenties he owned a garage in Bexleyheath, had built up the
second-largest motor bike dealership in Britain and was running a highly
successful used-car business, Weekend Car Auctions. Those enterprises,
and some property dealings around London, made him a millionaire.
He raced motorbikes for a while and then cars, enjoying the sport so
much that he bought the Connaught Formula One team in 1958, and in 1970
bought Brabham which he had been managing. The drivers he has worked
with include Carlos Reutemann, Carlos Pace, Nelson Piquet -- who won two
world championships -- Damon Hill, Ayrton Senna, and Nigel Mansell.
Established at Brabham, he took a look at FOCA and the rest -- after
some bruising in-fighting and much Byzantine intrigue with the
established powers -- is history. He had realised, as a team owner, what
they had failed to spot. That television was the open sesame to riches
for the sport, but that to bring in television and major sponsors the
sport itself had to change. Because he controls all television in motor
sport he controls its major source of income, sponsorship apart, while
the sponsors are his puppets because the image they want to project
through the sport depends on him.
He found himself involved in controversy when he spoke of a ''culling
season'' among drivers, suggesting that younger drivers were unaware of
the realities of the sport, following the death of Ayrton Senna. While
he was probably saying no more than the truth, it caused upset and he
was not welcome at Senna's funeral in Brazil. It was a rare public
pronouncement, and a rare instance of controversy attaching itself to a
man whose climb to the top has not been without making enemies.
He has said that he is just a humble lad from Bexleyheath whose sole
aim had been to turn Formula One into a Class A act. That he has done so
is beyond dispute, but along the way he has done himself some good too
as that #30m pay packet demonstates. Has he been good for motor racing?
That is a matter which those who follow it debate endlessly. One thing
is for certain. It would not be like it is today without him. As one
senior motor racing journalist said -- ''he is a necessary evil''.

Anne Johnstone considers the arguments raised by this week's Court of
Appeal ruling
ANOTHER historic victory for exploited women workers or another nail
in the coffin for British competitiveness in world markets? Your view on
this week's surprise Court of Appeal ruling will depend largely on the
angle from which you view it.
The solicitor who brought the case on behalf of two sacked office
workers says the ruling could force the Government to pay out millions
in compensation to thousands of women who were denied protection from
unfair dismissal. An estimated 25,000 women could claim up to #11,000
each. The group of workers affected are those dismissed when they have
more than one but less than two years' service.
Ten years ago a Government Order introduced by Lord Tebbit increased
the qualification period for unfair dismissal claims from one year to
two. But this week the Court of Appeal ruled that this change breaks the
European Equal Treatment Directive. This is because women tend to have
far more career breaks than men and work for shorter periods, so the
Tebbit two-year rule affects women disproportionately.
As with other changes in employment law affecting workers' rights, the
Government's justification was that the change would encourage employers
to take on more workers and would improve British competitiveness.
Unless the Department of Trade and Industry can get the Court's ruling
reversed in the House of Lords, the Government will now be forced to
restore the limit to one year.
Yesterday Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, said: ''The concern in
the Scottish business community must be whether this would reduce
competitiveness. We will be analysing the ruling carefully before making
any judgment.''
Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash immediately dismissed the ruling as ''another
example of our bending the knee to Brussels''. But the home of sprouts
was not such a dirty word in the Motherwell home of 49-year-old Margaret
Ewing yesterday.
Margaret has done shop work on and off since she left school at 16.
''I used to be told I was one of the best and very dependable.'' After
the birth of her children she switched to part-time jobs, working at
times when her mother could care for them. In 1988 she was working in a
local department store demonstrating domestic appliances when she was
made redundant without explanation or warning. Since then, she says, she
has taken a number of jobs but none has lasted longer than a few months.
Most recently she worked in a shoe shop where she wasn't told what hours
she would be working on any one day. ''If it was quiet, they'd send you
home at lunchtime but then expect you to work extra hours the next week
or the next day. I'd give anything to have a decent job again with
regular pay and hours. Instead employers will offer you bits and pieces
and can pay you off at the least excuse.''
Jane Simpson (not her real name) hopes that this week's ruling will
enable her to bring a compensation claim against the company who
employed her doing office work in the Western Isles before abruptly
dismissing her after 23 months. ''I was angry because I believe I'd been
doing a good job and my employer wasn't obliged to give any reason for
sacking me.''
Welcoming the ruling, Peter Hunter of the Scottish Low Pay Unit said
the Tebbit amendment had enabled employers to take on workers for what
amounted to a two-year probationary period: ''It meant that for 24
months a worker could not go to her employer with a complaint or to ask
for a paid holiday or a pay rise without fear of being sacked without
any reason being given.'' He said the decision represents ''another
radical improvement in workers' rights'', following the new rights won
for part-timers, as a result of another court ruling last year.
Morag Alexander, head of the Equal Opportunities Commission in
Scotland, said the case marked a significant victory because of the
rapidly increasing number of workers employed on short-term contracts.
''There is no evidence that the 1985 amendment created more jobs as the
Government said it would and we don't believe that reversing it will
destroy jobs. Employers shouldn't be acting unfairly anyway.''
If this week's Court of Appeal ruling is upheld in the House of Lords,
hundreds of thousands of workers, both women and men, will win new
protection against unscrupulous employers. The prospects for workers
dismissed over the past decade look less bright, according to the
Scottish Low Pay Unit. The two sacked office workers brought their case
under three headings, only one of which was accepted by the court. The
court rejected the argument that the sackings also contravened the
European Equal Pay Directive and this could inhibit retrospective
claims. Also some tribunals might argue that the dismissals were too
long ago and at this stage it would be impossible to prove they had been
unfair. So could this be another Pyrrhic victory for women in the
workplace?

BACKPACKERS, campers, hikers and bikers usually crowd the North of
Scotland at this time of the year. Some come in cars, some in coaches,
and a few have those flashy mobile homes with a bath at the rear window.
But what about people who want to stay in the area for longer than a
week or two, and don't have a home-on-wheels? Can holiday spots really
cope with normal letting requirements?
''No problem,'' says Vivienne Low, who handles residential lettings
for Inverness estate agent Collins &amp; Keyes. ''Letting is good business.
In fact, this is our main period right now. A lot of people seem to come
up here for a holiday, and decide to have a look around for a place to
purchase.''
''That means they need a place to stay, maybe for a year, maybe 18
months. They just decide they like Scotland as a place to stay, and this
area meets their needs.''
Typically, a young couple will send one partner to look for a place to
buy, staying for as long as is needed before calling in the other half.
There's no rush to pick the first house on offer.
Nor do families make many impulse buys. They want the right size of
property, the right number of rooms, a garden to laze in, and a garage
for the car.
''Normally, our let is for six months as a minimum,'' Vivienne says.
''In fact, if you really want three months, but accept the risk of
having to pay for the other three as well if it is not taken up by
someone else, we can offer that service. We're the only ones here who do
that.''
Properties go from around #260 a month for a one-bedroom place, to
#550 for a fully furnished 6-7 bedroom house.
A cottage near Drumnadrochit in the mid-range, say #300 or so, would
provide a lounge, two bedrooms, kitchen/breakfast area, utility room,
and bathroom. There would be a garage and parking space.
Much the same figure would apply to a cottage in the quiet Inverness
residential area of Lochardil. A double bedroom, hallway, bathroom,
living room and kitchen. Small garden and off-street parking.
The Hilton area could be a bit dearer, around #350 for a two-storey
terrace house with vestibule, living room, dining area, kitchen,
breakfast area, a single and two double bedrooms, and bathroom.
Going more upmarket, near the town centre, a three-storey family house
would come in at around #550. That would give five bedrooms, lots of
room to move around, double glazing, and a garden front and rear.
Near-neighbours Scottish Highland Property Services find business is
so rapid they don't offer a brochure of properties. They too find lots
of people coming in from outwith the area.
Most of the incomers are from the south and the islands. In many
cases, people are looking for holiday cottages to rent. In business for
the past three years, SHPS find a ''very steady'' rental market, and
deal broadly from one and two-bedroom properties to the larger family
house.
Prices with Scottish Highland normally come in the range of #300/350 a
month to #600. Their catchment area is fairly wide, taking in places
like Tomatin, Aviemore, Grantown and Nigg, and they have an office at
Nairn.

WOULD you believe it? The latest survey claims that house prices have
fallen, but it's a good time to sell. Surely they must be kidding!
The average report on the state of the property market is about as
informed and reliable as tabloid speculation on football transfer deals.
One national association unveils a gloom-and-doom report forecasting
massive repossessions, while another survey tries desperately to talk up
the market. Who are we poor punters to believe? How can we test
conflicting opinions?
Well, for a start, we can treat the bank/building society survey that
bases its findings on UK-wide statistics as of academic interest only,
and we can ignore the opinions of lenders whose customer-base is almost
exclusively south of the Border. The Scottish market -- diverse enough
on its own -- is distinctly different from that in England.
Next, we can apply native gumption to check whether opinions expressed
are backed by meaningful and credible figures, and test what we are
being told against our own local experience and that of friends and
associates.
And then, most important of all, we can look at the size and kind of
the sample the survey's prognostications are based on.
Which brings me to this week's report which suggests that, though the
average sale price achieved for our homes has fallen by more than 2%,
Scots can sell and buy without penalty to achieve the home of their
choice. In other words, it's a normal, fairly stable market to trade in.
Further, that there has never been a better time for the owners of the
traditional three-bedroom semi to trade up to a three/four-bedroom
detached property.
The source of this information is Scottish, and the database it draws
on is around 20% of all residential property transactions in Scotland,
so perhaps we should pay heed when Slater Hogg &amp; Howison reports on 4525
individual sales in the half-year to June 1995, involving nearly quarter
of a billion pounds of property -- #244,000,000 -- spread through the
company's 33-branch network.
The average price during this period was #57,755 compared with #59,155
in the same period of 1994, representing a fall of 2.3%
Hamilton is one of the areas which continue to enjoy relatively strong
demand, Lanarkshire performed well in general, with Slater Hogg's four
branches in Hamilton, East Kilbride and Cumbernauld increasing sales to
more than #41m.
Glasgow's West End has reported price increases in areas such as
Hyndland and Dowanhill, fuelled by a lack of choice in the #50,000 -
#95,000 range in particular.
Managing director Colvil Johnston comments:''Regardless of the market
Slater Hogg sell houses successfully. We are always trying to get the
message across that even if you are selling for less you are also buying
for less and therefore able to move without penalty.
Don't believe everything you read in the papers or see on television.
With good advice, accurate pricing and a positive sales team you can
move home in 1995.''
Colvil Johnston points out an interesting fact that Slater Hogg sales
statistics has revealed.
The traditional, mature, three bedroom semis are in short supply in
areas such as Bearsden, Clarkston, Kilmarnock, Ayr and Kirkintilloch,
because their current owners don't have the confidence to trade up,
although the ambition is still there. Yet, ironically, the gap between
the three-bedroom semi and the three/four-bedroom detached has never
been closer. The step up used to be from around #75,000 to over
#100,000, but with the three-bedroom semi holding its price, the move up
the market can now be made for between #10,000 and #15,000.
The messages now coming from the vast majority of Slater Hogg offices
across the Central Belt are that:
* House prices are having to be realistic in order to sell.    *
Buyers have become highly discerning, and are price-sensitive to the
pound, as far as their local market is concerned.    * With the wide
choice available, the condition of your home is vital.

A LOCAL MP has claimed that the strategy for Irvine Development
Corporation to dispose of its housing stock in advance of being wound up
is ''in tatters'' following the withdrawal of a housing association.
The corporation has countered, however, by saying that the strategy
remains on course and that the association's withdrawal was entirely
amicable.
Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, last night described the
decision by County Palatine to withdraw from the ballot for tenants as
''dramatic and highly significant''. Earlier, the corporation said
County Palatine had pulled out simply because it wished to pursue
interests elsewhere. The association would have been interested in 30%
of the existing housing stock.
Mr Donohoe is unhappy about the choices left for tenants as only the
Irvine Housing Association, supported by the corporation, and
Cunninghame District Council remain.

A TELEPHONE system which will allow Strathclyde Police to set up
instant hotlines went into operation yesterday.
The #200,000 BT FeatureNet system provides them with the equivalent of
their own telephone network, enabling hotlines to be set up within
minutes of emergencies, such as the 1988 Lockerbie disaster.
After the 1988 bombing, calls to a national casualty bureau run by
Strathclyde Police caused a log-jam of their main switchboard before
additional telephone lines could be found.
The new network came on-line yesterday at Glasgow's Cranstonhill
Police Station and will be extended to 59 other divisions by October
1996.
A spokeswoman said: ''Within minutes of deciding to set up an
emergency incident room we can issue numbers to the public.

A MAN was jailed for life yesterday for killing a friend because he
had interrupted a football match on television.
James Muldoon, 59, of Millerfield Street, Dalmarnock, Glasgow, was
found guilty of the murder of 64-year-old John Madden.
The jury at the High Court in Glasgow heard that Mr Madden, of Baltic
Street, Dalmarnock, had suffered a stroke and was disabled on one side
of his body.
He went to Muldoon's 15th-floor flat in Dalmarnock to tell him about
vandalism at his own home.
However, Muldoon, who was drunk, was trying to watch a game between
Arsenal and Sampdoria on TV, and went berserk, the court was told.
He slashed and stabbed Mr Madden four times across the throat, and
battered his face with a table leg.
A member of the jury was so horrified by photographs of the dead man's
injuries, including a stab wound in the throat which cut into his spine,
that he collapsed.
Muldoon, giving evidence, told his defence counsel, Mr Edgar Prais,
QC, that his friend was the aggressor and that he only acted in self
defence when Mr Madden faced him with a knife.
He told Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, that Mr Madden had the knife
in his left hand, the hand which was disabled after his stroke.
The jury took just 25 minutes to find Muldoon guilty.

A VIEW of the sea and the hills, with top-class golf, skiing, and
fishing all within easy reach of your own front door. Sounds like
heaven? Well, Angus is one of Scotland's under-regarded paradises, a
place that offers a rich range of leisure activities and a wealth of
interesting properties.
One such is Greystone which, as befits any paradise, comes complete
with its own private church. Situated on the edge of a small hamlet in a
quiet part of Angus and surrounded by open farmland, the house faces
south and is protected by lovely old trees. The property is divided into
three lots.
''With its excellent accommodation and beautiful grounds, Greystone
House is a family home, while the smaller White House would be ideal for
relations or staff,'' says selling agent Mark Gibson of Brodies in
Edinburgh.
The former church could be used for a variety of purposes in
conjunction with the rest of the property, from storage of hay for
horses to a studio or huge indoor games room. Each of these three parts
of the property stands on its own, so purchasers have the opportunity to
offer for the place as a whole or in individual parts.
The fine, old gabled house, Lot 1, is built mainly of stone under
slate roofs, together with a more recent cedar-clad extension. ''The
light, spacious rooms are well proportioned, and with interesting period
features. These include elegant stone fireplaces, a curving staircase,
ceiling cornices, astragalled windows and working shutters,'' says Mark
Gibson.
The accommodation comprises: outer hall with terrazzo floor, inner
hall, sitting room, drawing room, gun/rod room, dining room, kitchen,
laundry room, wine cellar, office, five bedrooms, two dressing rooms,
two bathrooms a garage and stable blocks.
The White House, Lot 2, has hall, sitting room, dining room, study,
pantry, kitchen, three bedrooms, bathroom and a generous-sized garden,
most of which is laid to lawn.
''This south-facing house has been the subject of considerable
improvement recently, including a new oil-fired central heating
system,'' says Mark Gibson.
The former church, Lot 3, is set within about a quarter-of-an-acre.
Built at a time when many more people worked on the land and the local
school had a roll of 130 children, this fine old building became too
much for the local parish when the population fell as farming became
more mechanised.
The main body of the building measures 60x40 ft and has a concrete
floor and decorative timber-lined ceiling.
''The gracefully arched windows have been blocked up but could be
re-opened. The former vestry has pine lining to dado height and,
together with a disused store room, occupies a single storey
extension.''
The asking price for the whole property is over #300,000. Lot 1 is
priced at offers over #200,000, Lot 2 offers over #80,000, Lot 3 offers
over #20,000.

RECENT summer weather is only one of the reasons why Scottish builders
have experienced a health flow of visitors through their showhouses over
the past few weeks.
Equally valid is the steady increase in the availability of
part-exchange offers freeing homeowners from the uncertainties of
selling their existing homes.
One national housebuilder is currently emphasising that it can take
properties anywhere in Britain into part-exchange consideration when
customers are looking to relocate in Scotland.
Another has announced that it is willing to increase the amount it
will set against a new house, giving a full l00% of valuation of the
existing home. Normally it would deduct between #l000 and #2000 to go
towards some of the costs involved in a part-exchange transaction
package, with its many extras.
And a third now extends its scheme to cover a section of the
house-buying market who may have felt lost and overlooked in
part-exchange deals.
''These are people who want to move to a smaller home but who often
find their existing property can't be accepted for part-exchange because
they are trading down,'' explained the national sales director of a
builder currently working on 16 locations throughout central Scotland.
Most part-exchange schemes are geared to assist people trading up to a
larger new house, with an upward difference in value of, in many cases,
around #20,000.
''We have introduced an assisted purchase scheme to supplement our
regular part-exchange scheme,'' she explained. ''Working in conjunction
with a major group of estate agents, we can include the owners of larger
properties by offering them a special package of help to assist in
marketing that existing property to the best advantage.''
In addition to making expertise available, there are financial
benefits involved by paying agreed estate agency fees and up to #500
worth of advertising costs to sell the larger property.
A general plus being pointed out to potential customers at showroom
sales desks is that while part-exchange values may be slightly lower
than the sellers might obtain on the open market there are variations in
part-exchange schemes and these schemes can sometimes be negotiated
months ahead. This can remove much worry and hassle and may also save
the seller much of the costs involved in selling in the ordinary way.
The valuation and offer process of a proposed part-exchange scheme is
carried out with no wasting of time. Many firms operate on a guaranteed
and free of charge offer on the existing home being made within seven
days.
''We have bought in a record number of homes in part-exchange over the
past few months,'' said a Glasgow area sales negotiator. ''We bought in
and sold homes ranging from #21,000 flats to top of the range family
properties costing in excess of #l47,000. Our current part-exchange
position is surpassing all previous seasonal totals.
''The attractions are easy to see. More householders are opting for a
speedy and frustration-free move. As builders, it is up to us to help in
that process. A part-exchange agreement which satisfies everyone can
result in speedy, trouble-free savings of hundreds of pounds which would
otherwise be spent on advertising, estate agency and valuation selling
costs.''
Builders are careful to point out that not everyone automatically
qualifies for part-exchange. Several factors come into the calculations
involved and both parties have to be totally satisfied before the
agreement goes ahead.
In many instances the choice, as well illustrated by the clear
information now available in many showhouses, can come down to a
housebuilder either being willing to consider buying a customer's
present home subject to its normal part-exchange conditions or offering
to assist the potential customer in making a sale with the support of
professionals. A trouble-free move is as important to the builder as it
is to the customer.

STANDING proud above Loch Long, Ben Arthur's unusual shape is better
known to generations of hillwalkers as the Cobbler. Just across the loch
stands Mansefield, a charming house which enjoys lovely views of the
mountain.
The house dates from the Victorian era, and is built mainly of stone
under a slate roof. It is run as a guesthouse producing a good annual
turnover, according to the selling agents.
The accommodation comprises: drawing room, dining room, sitting room,
kitchen, bedroom with en-suite shower room, five letting bedrooms, six
further bedrooms, bathroom and shower room.
Adjoining the rear of Mansefield is a separate cottage which has been
converted from the former outbuildings. This could be let out to provide
additional income and comprises sitting room, kitchen, two bedrooms and
a bathroom.
Mansefield is surrounded by beautifully maintained gardens which
extend to about three acres and are a key feature. They provide a
display of colour throughout the year with rhododendrons and daffodils.
Mansefield has a right to a mooring in Loch Long, with direct access
to the open waters of the Firth of Clyde.
Andrew Spencer-Nairn of Strutt and Parker, who is handling the sale,
is confident that the scenic location combined with proximity to Glasgow
will result in Mansefield generating considerable interest.
He says: ''The house and gardens have been maintained to a high
standard, and at offers over #210,000, including the cottage, I believe
we will receive many enquiries.''

Pacific project brings
new wave of activity
AN unusal three-storey home on
the Clyde which has been visited by floods of day trippers is set for
a dramatic change in its outlook.
Built by Laing Homes at the time of the Glasgow Garden Festival, the
townhouse was a major attraction, with thousands of festival visitors
queueing to troop through it.
It was sold after the festival along with the other houses built
beside it. The rest of the site lay derelict for some years, but it has
now been re-named Pacific Quay, and is scheduled for a major leisure and
business park development, bringing new life to the area and
transforming the views from the townhouse, which is being sold by SEAL.
In addition to its views over the Canting Basin, the property has
private gardens to both front and rear, and is within a few minutes
drive of the city centre. It is also convenient for bus and subway
services.
The accommodation comprises ground-floor reception hallway with
cloakroom/toilet, bedroom and integral double garage; the middle floor
has a principal lounge with patio windows on to a small balcony
overlooking the Canting Basin, broad archway to formal dining room,
modern fitted kitchen (oven, hob and cooker hood); the upper floor has
four bedrooms, all with good storage and master with en-suite shower
room, a family bathroom and gas central heating from a combination
boiler.
The development of Pacific Quay is to be carried out by Miller
Developments in conjunction with the Glasgow Development Agency.
Proposals include the prestigious Scottish National Science Centre, a
multi-screen cinema, catering, and the construction of the Millenium
Tower. There will also be a major business park.
Offers over #125,000 are sought.

THE STATELY vessels which took part in last month's Tall Ships Race
have slipped over the horizon, but in their wake a new tide of
development is tugging at the piers and wharves of the Forth.
A joint venture has been agreed between Morrison Homes (part of the
Morrison Construction Group) and Forth Ports PLC to create a #7.5m
development of apartments in Leith's prime Victorian Dock site, adjacent
to the new Scottish Office.
Morrison Homes plan to develop 86 apartments and four luxury penthouse
suites, all overlooking the Water of Leith.
The partners hope to gain final consent for the development in
September. Tony Donnelly, Morrison Homes director, said: ''The joint
venture plans to provide quality accommodation at the heart of the
transformed Leith waterfront, rapidly becoming one of the most exciting
and fashionable residential locations in the city.
''The proposal appreciates the growing demand for quality housing in
exciting locations. The Tall Ships Race has provided the chance to show
the area as exactly that to many hundreds of thousands of people.''
Property director of Forth Ports plc, Terry Smith, said: ''The port of
Leith is emerging as the most dynamic working area in Edinburgh, with
new quayside walkways and roads opening the waterfront of Scotland's
capital city for development.
''We are keen to create true, sustainable development in the older
historic part of the port, with families living, working and enjoying
leisure time amidst the spectacle of cruise ships and other vessels.''
0   Morrison Construction Group is one of the largest privately-owned
construction companies in the UK.

<HEADLINE>Congress votes to end embargo. Weapons victory for Bosnia</HEADLINE>

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, faced with a vote in Congress to lift the
Bosnia arms embargo, will persist in his efforts to veto the move.
The strength of the vote -- 298 to 128 -- was less than a similar
House vote to lift the embargo in June, but the White House admitted
that it was ''still substantial''.
Congressional supporters said the world could not stand by as they
said it did during the Nazi Holocaust. They said the UN embargo had to
be lifted so that Bosnia Muslims could defend themselves.
The result was eight more than the 290 votes, or two-thirds of the
435-member House, needed to override Mr Clinton's threatened veto.
Press secretary Mike McCurry said afterwards: ''The President is
disappointed with today's vote in the House unilaterally to lift the
arms embargo against Bosnia Herzegovina.
''He repeats his pledge to veto the Bill and is confident that his
veto will be upheld in Congress.''
Mr McCurry added pointedly: ''Now is not the time to Americanise the
conflict.''
He repeated White House warnings that a unilateral lifting of the arms
embargo would drive the UN force out of Bosnia, oblige the United States
to send in ground forces to assist that withdrawal, and divide Nato.
Mr McCurry said that Nato members had taken an ''important decision''
in Brussels yesterday to strengthen the UN mission and halt Bosnian Serb
aggression by extending the threat of decisive air strikes previously
made for the city of Gorazde to the other ''safe areas'' of Sarajevo,
Bihac, and Tuzla.
''At a time when the international community is showing new resolve to
stabilise the situation in Bosnia and get negotiations back on track, it
doesn't make sense to take action that could undermine these efforts and
encourage the UN mission to withdraw,'' he said.
The Senate voted to end the embargo last week, by 69 to 29, also well
over the two-thirds needed to defeat the veto.
The Bill provides that the embargo will be lifted when the UN has
completed withdrawing its troops from Bosnia, or in 12 weeks, whichever
comes first.
Mr Clinton yesterday remained determined to veto the Bill. He affirmed
his belief that when the vote to override the veto comes around, there
will be enough members of Congress to support his view.
Not many people in Washington share his optimism, though there will be
much behind the scenes activity to persuade enough Congressmen to change
their votes to save the day. The Bill's supporters need a solid 290
votes to defeat the President's veto, thus Mr Clinton's staff are
already making lists of the nine or 10 people they need to persuade.
After the Nato meeting in Brussels, Secretary General Willy Claes made
clear that warplanes would hit back hard at attacks on UN ''safe areas''
in Bosnia.
''The Council has today approved the necessary planning to deter
attacks by any party, and I repeat any party, on the 'safe areas' of
Bihac, Sarajevo, or Tuzla,'' he told reporters after a meeting of Nato
ambassadors.
''Any attacks on them will be met with the firm and rapid response of
Nato air power,'' Mr Claes continued.
He said the decision followed last week's Nato agreement to launch
allied air strikes against any attack or even the threat of an attack on
the Gorazde enclave, the only remaining ''safe area'' in eastern Bosnia.
He added that the individual characteristics of each enclave had to be
taken into account in the tactical planning of defensive air raids.
Mr Claes said Nato was particularly concerned about Bihac, which has
been under concerted attack by rebel Bosnian Muslims, Croatian Serbs,
and Bosnian Serbs. He called on all warring factions to agree to a
ceasefire before the Bosnian war becomes a full-scale Balkan war.
* Defence Minister Volker Ruehe yesterday gave 14 German fighter jets
stationed in Italy the final go-ahead to start supporting the United
Nations peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, his ministry said.
Eight radar-beating ECR Tornados able to seek and destroy hostile
anti-aircraft batteries and six regularly equipped reconnaissance jets
backing the British-French-Dutch Rapid Reaction Force have completed
preparations for any missions.
A defence ministry spokesman said Bonn had wrapped up political
discussions with the UN and Nato about the jets' use and settled all
technical details.
