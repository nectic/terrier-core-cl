DESPITE strenuous efforts to the contrary, Motherwell will not have a
new face in their line-up when they turn out for their afternoon date
with Hibs at Easter Road today.
Dutch defender Mitchel van der Gaag looks certain to be a Fir Park
player before much longer, but he will not be in place by kick-off time
today. ''Unfortunately there are a few loose ends which cannot be tied
up in time for Easter Road,'' said Motherwell manager Alex McLeish.
''Foreign transfers are sometimes not as straightforward as those in
this country. It is disappointing for myself and the player that we have
been caught up in red tape, but it is something we must accept.
''I am still very confident the deal will go through but it will be
later in the week.''
McLeish's team will have very little support for a game that police
insist has to be all-ticket on a midweek afternoon when few employed
folk will be able to get time off.
The rebuilding work which has begun at Easter Road, putting half of
the floodlights out of action, is the reason for the early kick-off
(3.30), and the consequence may be a record low attendance for a Hibs
home match this season.
Even so, McLeish points out that there are great incentives for each
team. The Motherwell manager is fully aware that a win would put his
team eight points clear of Hibs in the premier division table and make
them hot favourites for a place in the UEFA Cup next season.
''We are concentrating on the clubs around us and on getting back into
the UEFA Cup. If we do that it will be a fine achievement. It's an
important game but Hibs will regard it as vital to them as it is to
us.''
McLeish has an injury worry over defender Rob McKinnon, who is
troubled by a hamstring, and is likely to keep Tommy Coyne on the bench
while the Alex Burns-Dougie Arnott double act is working well.
Hibs might give new signing Andy Millen, from Kilmarnock, his first
game as Graham Mitchell is struggling with a leg injury. Manager Alex
Miller has two other doubts, Kevin McAllister and Gareth Evans, but
said: ''Whoever is fit, this is a game we have to win to have a chance
of qualifying for Europe.''
* PAUL Rideout, the former Rangers striker, could return to English
Premiership action within a fortnight -- and save Everton millions in
the transfer market.
The player has damaged knee ligaments, but is recovering well and
could come into consideration for the struggling side's next match,
against Blackburn on April 1.

SCOTTISH dairy farmers who have been gambling on the possibility that
they will be allowed to exceed production quotas without penalty may
soon be shown to have been playing with fire, a major quota broker
claimed yesterday.
Andrew Macfarlane, of Hayes McCubbin Macfarlane, said it was now
almost certain that a levy payment of 30p per litre would be imposed.
''For a producer with 500,000 litres annual quota that would mean a bill
of #5000 if he exceeded his limit by 3%,'' he said.
''Our advice to producers is that they must get down to their own
individual quota levels -- or as near to them as they can -- and not
rely on some mythical percentage by which they think they can exceed
quota.''
Exceptional circumstances last year had resulted in a last-minute 9%
leeway, he said. Farmers should not count on anything this year beyond
the 0.5% which had already been conceded.
The indications are that whatever measures farmers are taking to deal
with the problem of over-production they are not rushing to buy or lease
additional quota as a way of mitigating the level of penalty they would
have to pay. Some face a considerable bill for being substantially
over-quota.
''I was expecting more interest, especially as the price has eased
back a bit compared to December and the quota year runs out at the end
of this month,'' said Mr Macfarlane. ''There must be some people taking
a big risk.''
There are reports of individual farmers trying to cut back on
production by drying off cows or bringing forward plans to cull some of
their herd but the main milk purchasers say that there is no noticeable
fall-off in milk volumes.
Mr Tom Reid, vice-convener of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland
milk committee, said he had heard of producers indulging in last-minute
efforts to achieve cuts which would keep them near their own quota
levels.
On the global scene, however, there was no indication of a shortage of
milk supplies.
Dr Donald McQueen, director of the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation,
said that there was no sign of an imbalance between supply and demand
for liquid milk in Scotland.
Some cheese production plants had been deliberately closed this month
for a maintenance period and that could have offset the effect of
producers restricting their output. There had been fears that farmers
might panic and stop selling milk at all, he said.
Among the major purchasers, Scottish Milk said it had detected no
signs of short-fall although some of its producers were over quota. Alan
Wiseman of Wiseman Dairies in East Kilbride said volumes were rising.
''We are up on last week and everyone else I have spoken to is in the
same boat.''
Most farmers are a bit philosophical about the situation. The volumes
were produced earlier in the year.''

NEIL MacRae, the former Scottish boy internationalist, has moved to
support the cause of American golf scholarships following a view
expressed in this column a fortnight ago, that those on offer in
Scotland are superior in terms of courses, coaching, and academic
standards.
MacRae, 22, graduated in business administration from Augusta College,
Georgia, at the end of last year, and the former Campsie and Buchanan
Castle member, who has just joined Cawder, is looking forward to his
first full season on the home amateur circuit following his four-year
sojourn.
The degree, of which he is proud, is being put to use in his job as an
administrator with travel firm, Perrygolf, in Helensburgh, and the
scratch player challenges the view of Dr Ian Thomson, the sports
bursaries coordinator at Stirling University, that scholarships in
Scotland -- now on offer at seven universities -- are the best in the
world.
MacRae, however, claims it is impossible to compare degrees -- and
golf courses -- between the two countries and feels that the popular
image of low academic standards in America stems from the number of
Scots who have attended junior colleges -- designed for those who do not
have entrance requirements for colleges and universities -- and who went
to play golf with no intention of obtaining a degree.
''I am of the opinion that a quality education can be obtained in the
US whilst undertaking an athletics scholarship,'' said MacRae, who
pointed out that, in his experience, no academic concessions were made
and that the NCAA, the athletics governing body, sets higher standards
than some individual institutions.
Thomson, incidentally, formed his general view -- which he vigorously
defends -- following extensive, worldwide visits to seats of learning,
but does not dispute that excellent scholarships are available in
America.
MacRae, now a Cawder member, said many coaches in America are PGA
pros, former Tour players or sports psychologists and that technical
teaching pros were easily arranged.
At Augusta he was under the guidance of Jim Kelson, a former mini-tour
player in Florida and a graduate in sports psychology. He also had
access to nine local courses, none of them, unfortunately, Augusta
National, where he was still invited to play once.
His main course was Forest Hills, jointly owned by the college and the
Augusta Golf Association. It was there that he won the Augusta College
Invitational tournament in 1991, with a two-round total of 143, one over
par.
MacRae added that collegiate golfers who do break through to the pro
ranks display a great deal of loyalty to their former institution. ''I
met Andrew Magee, a college friend of my coach, who gave me valuable
insights into how he approaches all aspects of preparation, practice,
fitness, and tournament golf.''
He is continuing preparations in Scotland and his ambition over the
next two seasons is to make the Scotland team and ultimately a life in
the pro ranks.
* STEPHEN Govenlock, whose Edinburgh-based company Govenlock Golf
Management is planning to send six young Scottish professionals on the
inaugural four-event Volvo China Tour next month, last night made a plea
for sponsorship to allow the trip to go ahead.
Alan Tait, Scott Henderson, Euan McIntosh, John Wither, Andrew Crerar,
and Colin Brooks are all poised to head east if #10,000 is made
available in the next few days. Other more established Tartan Tour pros,
who are able to finance themselves, are being contacted as possible
replacements.
Pringle and Highland Spring have already promised support for the
young players on the tour from April 7 to 30 ending in the 72-hole China
Open in Beijing.
* ONE of the great golfing bastions of male chauvinism crumbled last
week when women, although vastly outnumbered, attended the nineteenth
annual dinner of the Scottish PGA in Glasgow.
There were eight pioneering representatives of the distaff side, none
of them pro golfers, however, and nearly 600 men at the black-tie
occasion.
''It was a major step forward and was well received,'' said Neil
Simpson, secretary of the Scottish PGA, who explained that the committee
decision to end the men-only status reflected the fact that five women
are now PGA members north of the Border, and increasingly through
sponsorship the organisation is dealing with women in senior positions
in industry.

A CLOSER relationship with farmers and the local population will be
critical to the success of the Central Scotland Forest Initiative, said
Dr J Campbell Gemmell, chief executive, in the annual report of the
Central Scotland Countryside Trust, writes ROBERT ROSS.
Farm forestry has been clearly identified as the sector with most
potential, due to current favourable grants.
The trust strategy for a Central Scotland Forest takes in 620 square
miles, stretching from the Clyde to the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth.
Its own landholdings cover 145 hectares on seven separate sites.
In the coming year, said Dr Gemmell, they will be developing the idea
of the Citizen's Forest and pursuing initiatives on farm forestry and
wood utilisation.
Creating woodlands has proved a continuing competitive and commercial
challenge, said trust chairman Sir David Montgomery. ''Until now,
getting trees in the ground has not been easy due to the difficulties of
obtaining sites to plant, complex land ownership arrangements in the
area and poor financial incentives.
''The trust has lobbied hard over the year for better grants
specifically tailored to the needs and opportunities of the area and we
are glad that things are now beginning to move in our favour with the
recently-announced Forestry Authority Locational Supplement for tree
planting in the Central Scotland Forest area.''
That supplement is a #600-a-hectare payment available to landowners
who establish woodlands in the central belt. It comes in addition to any
other payments for which they may qualify under the Woodland Grant
Scheme and the Farm Woodlands Premium Scheme.
The trust completed 54 projects with farmers and landowners during the
year. These included new farm woodlands, shelterbelts, hedgerows and
rejuvenation of existing woodlands. Out of a total of 345,000 trees and
shrubs planted 64,000 were on farms. They also undertook 3.25 kilometres
of hedging and dyking on farms.
In West Lothian shelterbelts have been a popular means of creating
small woodlands as boundary markers and protection for crops and
livestock in exposed locations. Some plantings have also provided
buffers between farmland and housing areas.
Near the Avon heritage trail a local farmer has been helped to
establish a farm woodland with broadleaf trees as a contribution to the
heritage trail project. Funding for the two-hectare woodland came from
the Forestry Authority under the woodland grant and farm woodland
premium schemes. The income over the next 15 years from the planted land
is expected to be much the same as if the farmer had continued to graze
it.
The funding and formal partners in the Central Scotland forest
initiative include local authorities, local enterprise companies, the
Scottish Office, the European Union, the Forestry Commission, Scottish
Enterprise and Scottish Natural Heritage.
Thirty six per cent of the #2.4m budget last year came from Scottish
Natural Heritage and a further 21% was received from Scottish
Enterprise.

WELL; the jokes don't change; they just grow a few more whiskers and
another earful of corn. Say what you want, but Ron Goodwin always puts
on a good show. In this business you see a great conductor one week and
a duffer the next; hear a band playing for their lives one week, and as
though they're already dead the next.
With Goodwin, it's consistent. The music is brilliant and the band
plays with vigour and colour. Screen Classics was the title last night;
selections of music by Richard Rogers -- including a lovely Some
Enchanted Evening with the band bathed in blue and the music coloured by
gorgeous harmonies nicked from Richard Strauss, and a stream of big
movie tunes -- The Magnificent Seven, Jurassic Park, The Big Country,
and The Stripper with appropriate raunch.
Goodwin makes little of his own effort, but it pays to notice his name
again and again as arranger. Top-drawer he is too: Latin brio for Tico
Tico, nostalgia in a Disneytime selection, a mellow arrangement of The
Shadow of Your Smile for trombonist Lance Green. And -- one of his best
-- an indescribably beautiful setting of Send in the Clowns with the
tune first on cor anglais, then on violas, and bathed in a warm glow of
strings and harp. Heartrending.
And to cap it all, and send this lad home happy, the music for the
great postbus chase to the airport from Where Eagles Dare. What more
could a music critic ask for? Right, I'm off home to dig out the video.
Ready, Clint? Here we go.

<HEADLINE>Bank's controls blamed for Barings' fall</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>23</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979271804</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England's head of supervision, Brian Quinn, spoke
yesterday of the ''severe and dramatic breakdown'' of control systems in
Singapore which led to the collapse of Barings Bank.
Mr Quinn, one of a nine-strong inquiry team investigating what went
wrong at Barings, told Euro-MPs in Brussels that the derivatives market
on which Nick Leeson gambled hundreds of millions and lost, had
presented the banking world with a new challenge.
''Banks do live in a more challenging environment. The speed of change
of financial markets is, I think, probably unparalleled. Information
technology has meant a high premium on agility and the ability to see
change and react to that change.''
The instant nature of derivatives trading called for far closer
monitoring.
In a first taste of the Barings inquiry findings, Mr Quinn said: ''The
prima facie indications are that there was a rather severe and dramatic
breakdown of control systems as they related to the subsidiary company
in Singapore. More than that I cannot say.''
Mr Quinn was speaking at a European Parliament committee hearing on
derivatives trading in the wake of the collapse of Barings, the City of
London's oldest bank.
He said the inquiry team hopes to report ''as soon as possible'' --
probably within a few weeks.
''Was Barings collapse a small earthquake in Chile?'' said Mr Quinn
and went on: ''The failure of Barings did not lead to a failure of the
system. There was not a system collapse or spasm or meltdown. People did
have to move rather quickly.''
There was no blueprint for dealing with what had happened, although
guidelines had been agreed by European central bankers.
One of the key questions was whether the Bank of England was obliged
to step in to commit public funds in extreme cases to prevent any
further failure.
Mr Quinn said the inquiry was going on in two parts -- the first to
establish what actually happened ''who did what, who might have done
what in the circumstances which led to the collapse'', and the second to
see what lessons were to be learned.
The liberalisation of money markets had encouraged the growth of the
derivatives trade: ''The right thing to do is to find out what risks are
involved and see if you can limit those risks while permitting the
proper beneficial effects of derivatives trading.''
Mr Quinn said there was no conflict of interests because of the Bank
of England's involvement in the inquiry. The investigation was being
conducted by the Board of Banking Supervision, including six independent
members as well as the Bank of England Governor, Deputy Governor and Mr
Quinn himself.
But only the independent members would conduct the second part of the
inquiry seeking advice from the three senior banking heads if necessary.
Meanhile, European commissioner Mario Monti yesterday wrote to
Euro-MPs stating that Barings was only a small bank relative to the size
of the market. It had benefited by a rapid rescue operation in a
friendly takeover.
But Labour's Euro spokesman on economic affairs, Alan Donnelly, said
the commissioner was being complacent. ''Every time there is a collapse
we hear that it was just a glitch and there is nothing to worry about.
''Everything is fine, they tell us, and we should not be concerned. We
are told we should not be concerned about a young man destroying an old
bank. Perhaps our concern should be about an old bank destroying a young
man.''
Barings, taken over by Dutch group ING, collapsed at the end of
February after Mr Leeson incorrectly bet huge sums of money that the
Tokyo stock market would rise.

QUEENS Moat House has finally agreed a debt restructuring package with
its bankers after two years of negotiations.
The hotels group built up #1300m worth of debt after an acquisition
spree and reported the second-largest ever corporate loss in 1992 afer a
huge property write-down. Talks have been under way since March 1993
with the 74 banks involved about how to restructure the debt.
The final deal is close to one which was nearly agreed last December
involving a debt for equity swap which would leave the lenders with 60%
of the equity.
It depends on approval from shareholders and debenture holders at
meetings to be held in late April. If not approved the company would
face insolvency. It also has to receive the go-ahead from the courts.
Following approval trading could resume in the shares which were
suspended two years ago at 47[1/2]p. They would resume at a fraction of
this level.

SCOTLAND'S women bowlers, following their double success in Monday's
individual British championships, opened their bid for a third
successive home international championship with a 119-99 win over Wales
when the three-day series began yesterday in Ballymoney, Northern
Ireland.
The Scots then watched England coast to a 155-98 win over the Irish
hosts to set up a potential decider today.
Roberta Hutchison, the Falkirk player, who had guided clubmates
Maureen and Vikki Leishman to the British triples title on Monday,
counted 13 shots over the last six ends to beat Rita Jones 25-15.
Anne Watson added a 22-13 win over Stella Oliver, Joyce Lindores hit
back to beat Pam Griffiths 21-15, and Frances Haxton gave Scotland their
fourth win, 19-17 against Betty Morgan.
Wales' consolation wins came from Doreen Rowlands who beat Nancy
Davidson 21-15 and Ann Bainton by 18-17 over Jeanette Conlan.

THE tall and still imposing figure of Peter Oosterhuis, on
professional duty at the Portuguese Open as a commentator on European
tournaments for the fledgling American programme, the Golf Channel,
called to mind a long-ago event also disrupted by bad weather.
Last week, the Iberian spring briefly took a turn for the worse when a
cold, gale-force wind swept the Penha Longa course in the first round.
In 1974, the Italian Open, played that October on the Lido at Venice,
was reduced by nine holes, having been interrupted by seasonal mists.
Oosterhuis was then the dominant British player. That year was to be
his fourth in succession as winner of the order of merit with #32,127,
scarcely comparable with the #877,135 earned last season by Colin
Montgomerie. He also was runner-up to Gary Player in the Open
Championship at Royal Lytham.
The point about that Italian Open was that Johnny Miller, then as much
of a force on the US Tour, was runner-up to Oosterhuis and complained
loud and long that if the championship had not been foreshortened he,
Miller, would surely have seen off this boyish looking upstart.
In such circumstances there has to be sympathy for the tournament
director of the day. Whatever he decides to do will be acceptable to
some and highly unpopular with others. The firing line in Portugal was
occupied by Andy McFee, who duly caught the flak for the options he
took.
When the engines of the grand prix racing cars testing on the nearby
Estoril circuit were switched off, the loudest sound of whining came
from a few of those who were out early in the opening round and were
stopped in their tracks for three hours and 50 minutes until the gale
had abated somewhat.
''The course was unplayable, the tournament should never have
started,'' some lamented. Others cried ''foul'' because of the
uncompromising location of a few pin positions. In the circumstances,
although understandable from the view that many of the field were
obviously disadvantaged, the gripes were unsustainable.
Golf, after all, is an outdoor sport and, as such, is vulnerable to
the vagaries of the weather. Those who hanker for the sheltered life
might consider snooker or knitting or country dancing. The luck, or
otherwise, of the draw can fortunately still lead to the inequality
which is an integral, if frustrating, part of the game.
The latest slogan by the Portuguese tourist authority, no doubt
intended to attract the visitors, is to attribute to the country ''The
Thrill of Discovery.'' As a philosophy this one clearly holds little
appeal for professional golfers, whose self-interest -- not exclusive in
sport to them, of course -- requires the balm of equity.
But as McFee reasoned to this listener, principles also were at stake.
The tour's responsibility as the keeper of the flame of its own
integrity; the interests of the sponsor of the event; and, by no means
least, the concerns of the fee-paying television channels all had to be
taken account of.
Unless fields were restricted to miniscule numbers -- and no-one could
advance that as a serious solution without attracting wrath and ridicule
-- then from time to time, as in any other sphere of life, irritating
inequalities will happen. Why should professional golfers be immune?
Let the experience of the young English professional, John Bickerton,
be an example. He equalled the European Tour record for consecutive
birdies of eight, but because he was unable to complete his second round
he had four on the Friday afternoon and the other four early the
following morning.
The interval between these bursts of fire amounted to more than 12
hours and some 15 hours elapsed between the first and last of them. Even
so Bickerton's score was a relatively modest 68.

THE cooling towers of Didcot power station rise up from the
Oxfordshire countryside like grey sentinels which contrast starkly with
the greenery and rolling fields.
They create a sombre, almost brooding mood which is perhaps not as
incongruous when the eyesight is lowered, because spread out in the
shadows of the towers is another complex equally dedicated to the
generating of awesome power.
The Williams Grand Prix Engineering factory sits almost unnoticed next
door to the power station, and it is an impressive facility to which
visitors are welcomed, but allowed to look at only what the owner, Frank
Williams, wants them to see.
There is a conference centre and grand prix collection of cars which
chart the history of Williams' involvement with a sport which is as much
about science, design, and engineering as the lengths to which
individuals are prepared to test themselves, but there are factory areas
which are off limits. Steel roller doors remain closed to the outsider.
It is possible to imagine wall-to-wall computers flashing and buzzing
inside, while engineers fuss around issuing instructions as figures and
systems are checked a hundred times.
Millions of pounds are invested in this business -- Williams alone
employs 230 people with a wage bill of almost #9m to put his two drivers
on the grid -- and as little as possible can be left to chance.
Although they would prefer it were possible, the one part of the
system which can't be programmed is the grand prix driver himself, and
each time he squeezes into his cockpit -- unless, of course, he is Nigel
Mansell in which case he can't even be shoe-horned into his new McLaren
-- fear settles in beside him.
It is the extent of the driver's ability to master, and use, fear to
his advantage as he pushes himself to the limits of bravery and
endurance, which can determine how productive will be his season which
begins 10 miles south of Sao Paulo on Sunday afternoon.
From the Brazilian Grand Prix to the final race, the Australian in
Adelaide in November, David Coulthard intends to prove he possesses the
required qualities to remain calm and calculating while hurtling around
circuits at ridiculous speeds.
The Scot and Damon Hill are Williams' chosen drivers to challenge the
world champion, Benetton's Michael Schumacher, and he is under no
illusions about the enormity of the task.
Coulthard is respectful of Schumacher's prowess, but he has a strong
confidence in his own ability to use his first full season to lay down a
foundation on which a successful grand prix career can be built.
''Schumacher sets the benchmark, but I don't see why he can't be
beaten,'' he said.
The new technical regulations are expected to provide closer and more
exciting racing, and one of Coulthard's strengths is the consistency of
his driving, something quickly recognised by Williams when he had the
Scot test drive for him at the start of last season.
The 23-year-old displayed the strength of his desire and character
when he was asked to replace Ayrton Senna in the Williams team after the
Brazilian was killed at San Marino. It was an opportunity which
presented itself in tragic circumstances, but that is the nature of the
sport, and Coulthard had to take his chance even though the thought of
taking over from a driver considered by many to have been the best ever
might have crushed the resolve of anyone even remotely unsure of
himself.
However, Coulthard's eighth-place finish last season despite having
had only eight drives, proved he has the physical and mental strength to
race in close contests, and he would not be unhappy to go the distance
in close company with anyone. ''I am so excited about the season which
I'm starting as a contracted driver to the top team in Formula One,'' he
said.
''I learned so much last season in a short space of time and I feel
much more comfortable now that I have a car which I have seen through
from the drawing-board stage to the circuit.''
Coulthard, who left for Brazil on Sunday, has never driven the
Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace and will take time to familiarise himself
with its various nuances as well as seek the advice of Hill before
Sunday's race. ''However, I've never had much of a problem when it came
to learning circuits quickly,'' he said.
''Also, Damon and I have made up since our differences of last season
and so if I feel I have to ask him anything, I will. I'm sure we will
make a strong team.''
Coulthard, who is the more naturally gifted driver, was faster off the
grid than Hill on a couple of occasions last season, and the team had to
instruct the younger man to allow Hill, who was pushing for the driver's
championship, to pass. Also, there were stories that the pair almost
came to blows on one occasion, but F1 is a high-energy, intense
environment in which tempers do become ragged.
The new regulations and reduced engine capacity from 3.5 to 3 litres
have made the cars slightly slower, but Coulthard believes other
modifications offset that loss. ''For instance, at high speed we are
slower than before, but we have more traction,'' he explained. ''With 3
litres we will be required to do more driving.''
Apart from having to race against Schumacher, Hill, and eventually
Mansell whenever McLaren successfully alter his car's cockpit, Coulthard
also has competition from the past. It is inevitable that the young man
originally from the Dumfriesshire village of Twynholm will be compared
with Scottish legends Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart, and the greater the
improvement in his racing, the more detailed will the comparisons
become.
Coulthard would rather not have that extra baggage on his journey
which begins on Sunday, but he will never be able to race away from
those names. All he can do is pull on his helmet emblazoned with the St
Andrews Cross and drive to the best of his ability.
We wish him well.

BOLTON striker John McGinlay spent yesterday trying to contact Craig
Brown to plead his case to be allowed to play against Portsmouth this
weekend.
The striker is determined to take his cause to the wire with
Scotland's international team manager. He is an intense a patriot as
anyone in the squad -- probably, as a paid-up member of the Tartan Army,
even more committed than most.
He said so yesterday when he insisted: ''I will give 100% for Scotland
whatever happens -- but I would be telling a lie if I said I was happy
at being taken out of the Bolton team.
''With Pat Nevin being left out of the squad, Bolton are the only side
being penalised -- and I am the only player left in this situation. It
doesn't seem right to me and I want the chance to put my case to the
international manager.
''I have already made my point about Colin Hendry being allowed to
play on a Sunday but, it is also the case that I will be in Scotland on
Saturday morning and left at a loose end after training.
''The home-based lads will go off and only a few of us from down south
will be at the hotel. I have to be honest, I would rather play for
Bolton and then come up to Glasgow on Saturday night.
''I have a cup final place at stake, after all.''
McGinlay believes that missing the match at Portsmouth could mean
missing the Coca-Cola Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley.
He pointed out: ''I have been away with Scotland before, scored a goal
at international level, and returned to the club to find myself out of
the side.
''I know Bruce Rioch, and if someone comes in and scores on Saturday
then I will be a spectator at Wembley.
''That is what I want Craig Brown to consider. If he won't listen,
then I will spend my time in Moscow worrying about what might happen to
me.
''A couple of years ago I thought I would never play for Scotland --
and I didn't think I would play at Wembley. Now, they are both there for
me and I have a major problem about the games. It shouldn't be like
that.''
Brown has other problems in the striking department.
Duncan Ferguson is doubtful and Chelsea's John Spencer also is out of
the reckoning. Only McGinlay and Hibs' Darren Jackson remain.
Brown maintains that McGinlay must be there on Saturday, for an hour
or so, at a Fir Park work-out.
FIFA rules are on his side, but whether they should be rigidly applied
in this case is another matter.
If McGinlay lost his Wembley place it would devastate the player and
would surely trouble Brown's conscience.
Is it worth that for a Fir Park kick-about? It is doubtful.

IT is unusual for Exeter to be in the racing spotlight, but this
certainly will be the case this afternoon, with more than #1.5m on offer
in the Tote Jackpot bet at the Devon track.
All that is necessary to land the cash is to forecast the winner of
all six races. Sounds easy but, of course, is isn't. The Jackpot pool
has been running since last week's Cheltenham Festival and, so far,
punters' millionaire dreams have not lasted too long.
At Stratford yesterday, the meeting kicked off with a 14-1 winner and
to add to the misery, 30 minutes later a 25-1 shot -- ridden by a
Japanese jockey -- dealt Jackpot punters another blow, the knock-out
punch coming by way of a 20-1 chance in the last. Cards and selections
for the Exeter meeting as well as the day's two others fixtures are on
Pages 34 and 35. Good luck.

ABERDEEN were dealt a serious blow in their bid to avoid relegation
yesterday when Theo Snelders was virtually ruled out for the rest of the
season.
The goalkeeper had a foot put in plaster after a second hospital
examination revealed that he had fractured a bone, sustained in a
collision with team-mate Joe Miller.
Dons' caretaker manager Roy Aitken said: ''This is a serious blow at a
critical stage in the season because Snelders is one of our most
experienced players.
''Although the swelling in the foot had gone down, he was still
feeling it very tender.
''To be on the safe side, we had the foot x-rayed again which this
time showed a slight hairline fracture in one of the bones.
''He will be in plaster for at least three weeks, then it will depend
on the healing process as to when he could restart training.''

THE latest attempt to restructure the Scottish League has collapsed.
Dundee director Nigel Squire launched a call for reconstruction almost
a fortnight ago when he sent letters to all 40 clubs, but yesterday he
admitted he has ditched his attempt to bring about an extraordinary
general meeting to bring about a new set-up -- probably 16-12-12 -- in
time for next season.
Squire said that five out of 20 clubs in the top two divisions didn't
reply, and he is nowhere near mustering the 59 votes required out of 78
available to bring about change.
He said three premier clubs didn't respond while two were against and
five were positive. In the first division eight out of 10 were
pro-change but two didn't reply.
Hearts chairman Chris Robinson has already held an informal meeting,
attended by six premier club chairmen, but Rangers owner David Murray,
for one, is against any revamp.
Scotland's four divisions of 10 were introduced this season and the
set-up was intended to last for five years at least.

SCOTLAND'S first school of football excellence has been given a
remarkable #100,000 sponsorship to guarantee 300 pupils the best of
coaching every week for the next year.
The initiative shown by Clyde, who ran the project for the first three
months on their own, has been transformed into the Broadwood Soccer
Academy plc, with #50,000 from the Walker Group and the same amount from
Sportsmatch, the business sponsorship incentive scheme run by the Sports
Council.
Head of coaching is Clyde manager Alex Smith who, with his various
assistants, has extended the SFA's community scheme to produce a
football school which he hopes will engender a real community spirit,
perhaps some special players for Clyde, and a new generation of fans for
the Cumbernauld side.
A unique feature of the project is that all 21 full-time Clyde players
will become licensed to coach children. ''We felt we need to bring
football here in line with other countries,'' said Smith, ''and with
this sponsorship I am sure we can go along that path. The players here
will be put through their 'D' licences which allows them to teach
children.''
Scotland coach Craig Brown, a former Clyde manager, was equally
enthusiastic. ''If anyone can mastermind an academy of this kind Alex
Smith has to be the man. He is respected and admired by everyone in the
game and I hope this scheme will become a model for other clubs to
follow.''
The academy directors will now seek further sponsorship to fund the
following two years.
Brown presented Smith with the #50,000 from the Walker Group while
Scotland's last rugby Grand Slam-winning captain, David Sole, who is a
member of the Sportsmatch panel which judges the merits of applicants
for funding, added the pound-four-pound backing from the Government
body.

Kilmarnock 0, Celtic 1
JUST when they seemed destined for draw number 17 in the league,
Celtic snatched the goal that hoisted them into third place in the
premier division and settled a match that was maybe too keenly contested
to make it worth the admission money.
Andy Walker, who came on in the second half for Willie Falconer, found
the key to goal with a diving header four minutes from the end at a time
when Celtic, admittedly, were giving the Kilmarnock defence their
hardest period of the evening.
There had been little in it overall, however, and had Walker's effort
not gone in, no-one could have denied Killie their right to some reward.
Celtic had good players in Rudi Vata and Paul McStay, while Kilmarnock's
willing workers gave their all, as ever.
Proving yet again that football fans have long memories, the Killie
support made sure that Pierre van Hooydonk was reminded of their
distaste for what they perceived to be a ''dive'' that produced a
penalty the last time the two sides met in the league at Hampden.
Every time the Dutchman touched the ball he was soundly booed. It
didn't disturb the striker too much, however, as he demonstrated early
in the first half when he cleverly touched on an Phil O'Donnell pass to
Brian McLaughlin, who broke clear of the Ayrshire defence and raced 40
yards towards goal.
The Celtic winger then manoeuvred around the keeper, Dragutin Lekovic,
but went too far wide and had to field the ball to McStay.
He was stopped in his tracks by two Killie men but his claims for a
penalty were ignored. Eventually, John Collins tried a shot which the
keeper saved.
That was a little cameo of the madcap pace at which both teams were
going about their business, exhilarating, but a bit too frantic.
Steve Maskrey had nearly snatched a goal earlier when he nipped in on
a pass from Tom Brown but Pat Bonner was able to save comfortably. In
fact, after their rejigged back four, with Tommy Boyd alongside Tony
Mowbray at its heart and Vata at right back, settled, the Parkhead side
took control for a lengthy spell.
Mowbray might feel he could have done better with a free header from a
Tosh McKinlay corner, although Lekovic saved well, and van Hooydonk was
not all that far away with a bending free kick which hit the side net.
Kilmarnock came back as willingly as ever and Bonner just pipped Ally
Mitchell to a dangerous cross from Tom Black.
Derek Anderson was the second man to be booked -- Boyd had been first
after fouling Maskrey when he flattened Collins -- but, as the pace
continued at a ferocious rate, there was every chance more would follow.
Van Hooydonk suffered even greater fury from the home support when he
fouled Black on the touchline and was given a stern lecture by referee
Gerry Evans after he consulted a linesman.
Vata, having his first game of the season, was held back by Robert
Connor, who was booked for his indiscretion, and from Hooydonk's
free-kick Falconer's header was diverted by Black for a corner. A
mistake by McStay let Brown through but the striker hurried his shot and
Bonner was able to collect easily enough.
Kilmarnock had reasonable claims for at least a foul on the edge of
the box, perhaps even a penalty, when Maskrey went tumbling as Vata
challenged but referee Evans saw nothing wrong.
In 63 minutes Celtic tried to freshen up their attack by bringing on
Walker for Falconer but the new man missed a good chance soon after when
he had a clear header from a Collins cross but sent it weakly into
Lekovic's hands.
Mowbray was shown a yellow card after fouling Connor just before
Killie put on Colin McKee for Maskrey. There was not a lot of subtlety
about but Collins did bring some class to bear with a swerving shot that
Lekovic stopped with some difficulty. However, it was quickly back to
more macho pursuits as Neil Whitworth was booked for a foul on Walker.
As Celtic pushed hard in the late minutes, Killie sent on their new
signing from Hibs, Willie Findlay, who replaced Gus McPherson. The
Parkhead momentum was in full swing by now, however, and with four
minutes left a McKinlay cross was headed back into goal where Walker
dived to head the ball into the net.
Said Celtic manager Tommy Burns: ''It was a big game for us -- three
very important points. Now, we can go for second-top place.
''I thought we deserved to win because we dominated most of the play.
We did exceptionally well, Andy Walker will be on a high after
scoring.''
Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten's disappointment was not helped by the
news that two of his players had to go for X-rays.
Mark Skilling has a broken nose and a damaged cheekbone while Tom
Brown has a badly swollen foot.

Dundee United 1, Hearts 1
SERGIO helped Dundee United take a vital point at Tannadice last night
as Gordon Wallace's side edged themselves up one place in the premier
division.
The Brazilian scored midway through the second half as United
struggled back into the match after Allan Johnston had put Hearts in
front after 28 minutes.
While Tynecastle manager Tommy McLean was delighted that his
injury-hit side had extended their unbeaten run to seven games, there
was concern when defender Steve Frail was carried off with a nasty knee
injury just five minutes from the interval.
McLean said later: ''The damage does not appear to be as bad as was
first feared. It does look to be a ligament injury and that is bad
enough. But we will not know the extent of the damage until we get Frail
back to Tynecastle.''
Should the player escape a lengthy spell on the sidelines, it will be
good news for the Tynecastle support, the majority of whom see the
defender as a key figure in the club's bid for Scottish Cup glory early
next month.
The result appeared to satisfy Wallace. ''There was a lot of
commitment shown by the players,'' he said, ''and in the end few would
disagree that we deserved at least a share of the rewards.''
However, Wallace must have been far from satisfied about his team's
early performance.
Hearts keeper Craig Nelson dealt competently with what United could
throw at him prior to Allan Johnston opening the scoring after 28
minutes, a goal best forgotten by United captain Maurice Malpas who was
slack with an attempted headed pass back, allowing Johnston to lob the
ball over the keeper.
United's half-time pep talk had the desired effect and Craig Brewster
powered a 30-yard shot just wide early in the second period as Wallace's
players dug deep, and in 66 minutes United's pressure paid off with a
bizarre equaliser.
Nelson made a mess of a Billy McKinlay corner, Mark Perry nodded the
ball back into the danger area, and Gordan Petric and Brewster combined
to provide Sergio with the ammunition to volley in his goal from close
range.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, McInally, Malpas, Perry, Petric, Craig,
Bowman, McKinlay, Gomes, Brewster, Dailly. Substitutes -- Johnson,
Nixon, Garden.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Frail, Leitch, Levein, Jamieson, Berry, Mackay,
Bett, Johnston, Millar, Hagen. Substitutes -- Cramb, Locke, Smith.
Referee -- M Pocock (Aberdeen).

MANY congratulations to Adam Hunter on his victory in the Portuguese
Open -- another Scot on the winner's rostrum is always a welcome sight
and the Glasgow golfer has earned his place in the sun.
I just think it was absolutely ridiculous that Sam Torrance was
disqualified from the same tournament.
Our man Sam, who has a penchant for sleep-walking, was a bit dozy when
he signed his first-round card. His totalled score was correct, a 75,
but he had a 4 instead of a 5 at the fourteenth. And for that, according
to the rules of golf, he had to go.
Torrance, typically, blamed no-one but himself for the error and
certainly not his playing partner, the person who actually put down the
wrong figure. Nor was there any complaint from Gordon J Brand, also
disqualified when he discovered his 84 was a shot short of the full
damage.
All very admirable -- but quite nonsensical, in my opinion.
This is not some sort of monthly medal we are talking about here, it
is a major professional tournament. Nobody suggested for a moment that
Torrance or Brand were trying to gain an unfair advantage, they simply
made a very human error. Walking with them on the course would be
tournament scorers, the event was featured on television, their scores
for each hole would be recorded and posted in the media centre.
Why should it be the players' responsiblity to make a correct return?
Because it has always been that way we will be told. Did not the
charming Argentinian Roberto de Vicenzo actually miss out on a major
because of just such a slip?
Well, I think it is time for golf to move into the 20th century before
we reach the 21st. There is no good reason, apart from tradition, why
professionals should continue to do their own scoring.
Once upon a time, it was possible to stymie an opponent by blocking
the route to the hole with your own ball. That was outlawed because it
was manifestly unfair; so is this disqualification rule.
At the very least, before they sign, players should have the
opportunity to go over their card with the scorer who has followed them
round. At best, the responsibility for marking should be removed
altogether.
There was an amusing incident at a British Seniors' event some years
ago when one of the competitors suffered a mild heart attack. ''Get an
ambulance,'' shouted one official.
''Get him to sign his card first!'' cried another. The old boy
recovered, you will be pleased to hear.
Golf has an enviable reputation for honesty which no-one would wish to
alter. It should always be the player's responsibility to declare how
many shots he has taken. Leaving the administration to others is hardly
a radical departure.
After all, we do not ask Nigel Mansell to time himself as he goes
round the circuit, Stephen Hendry is not required to keep a running
total of his breaks, Rob Andrew does not signal which of his kicks go
over (they all do!).
Yet, a player could win the Open Championship and lose it in the
scorers' tent. I find that quite absurd.
* THE big question, following Saturday's Twickenham barney is not
whether anyone can shut the mouth of Brian Moore but if there is a pair
of shorts that can last a whole match while worn by England prop Victor
Obugu. He had to change his pants three times against the Scots.
He also ripped a pair in the Welsh match but insists it is not his
mighty thighs which cause the problems. ''Opponents pull them down when
we go into a scrum.''
Name names, Victor.
* I SEE Terry Venables is seeking clarification on legal matters. He
wonders whether it is time the Professional Footballers' Association
helped ''to establish some common ground rules so that players and
managers know what to expect in situations involving sport and the
law.''
How about this for starters, Tel?
No-one, no matter how good they are, will play for England is
convicted of a criminal offence. Seems very clear to me.

THIS early, now sadly seldom performed play by John Arden was first
staged in 1958, part of the New Wave of British drama, and was
considered pretty radical at the time for its implicit criticism of the
patronising paternalism of the welfare state. Arden charts the social
disintegration instigated by the housing of a travelling family, the
Sawneys, in a greenbelt council estate, with humour and clarity, and the
play's examination of society's failure to deal with individuals whose
needs and demands fall outwith conventional terrain provides as much
food for thought today as it did then.
Chosen by guest director Andy Arnold, Arden's play provides colourful
scope for the second-year students who respond with appropriate vigour
to its piquant language and rich vulgarity. The anarchy which the
Sawneys bring to the white-paved estate, with their post-nuclear,
dysfunctional brood further swelled by cranky travelling friends, seems
inevitable but the explosive effect they have on the seemingly prim and
proper Jacksons next door is more surprising, as the interactions
between the two families gradually reveal that the Jacksons are only a
few whitewashed doorsteps away from white trash themselves.
Somewhat characteristically, Arnold layers the drama with musical
accompaniment, with folk songs complementing the scenes of urban decay.
Arranged by Andrew Curry these songs often interrupt the action but
always enrich rather than detract from the drama on stage. Thus, a quick
bawdy burst from the rest of the cast provides a comic exclamation to
some onstage debauchery, while, contrastingly, a haunting lilt from
Carlin Smith as Rosie Sawney exacerbates the sombre tone of the play's
conclusion.

St Mirren 0, St Johnstone 0
AN uncompromising battle of the Saints ended with a point apiece, but
the Paisley side can rightly feel more aggrieved with the outcome having
enjoyed the lion's share of play and opportunities. A combination of bad
luck -- just ask man-of-the-match Barry Lavety -- and careless finishing
cost them dearly.
A veil could be drawn over the first half with little to excite the
fans other than a double dose of bad luck for the Buddies and Lavety.
In 13 minutes the youngster sent in a blistering drive from a superb
Baker pass, but the ball hit the bar and was cleared. Twenty minutes
later Lavety flicked a clever Elliot lob over keeper Main, but the ball
again struck wood.
The visitors' best first-half effort came via the sterling running and
accurate crossing of their likeliest lad, Kevin Twaddle. In six minutes
he sent over a measured cross into the goalmouth and Dave Irons headed
the ball wide of target.
Just before the interval, Twaddle again delivered an accurate free
kick into the goalmouth but Cherry was inches short of connecting.
On the resumption, St Johnstone moved up a gear with Curran, Ramsey,
and O'Boyle building nicely from midfield, but it was the Paisley lads
who almost broke the deadlock in 65 minutes. Stuart Taylor's powerful
header from a Jim Gardner cross flew just over.
The visitors hit back five minutes later and following a magnificent
inter-passing bout between McAuley and O'Boyle, the former was
unfortunate to see his final flick just clear the far post.
With only 10 minutes left Lavety scorned his easiest scoring chance
when he headed an Elliot cross tamely into the keeper's hands.
Six players were booked -- Stuart Taylor and Martin Baker of St
Mirren, and Paul Cherry, Phil Scott, Jim Weir and Paul Ramsey of St
Johnstone.
ST MIRREN -- Money, Dawson, Baker, McWhirter, Taylor, McLaughlin,
McIntyre, Fullarton, Bone, Lavety, Elliot. Substitutes -- Inglis,
Gardner, Combe.
ST JOHNSTONE -- Main, Cherry, McAuley, Irons, Weir, Curran, Scott,
Ramsey, Twaddle, O'Boyle, English. Substitutes -- McMartin, Wright,
Robertson.
Referee -- S Dougal (Burnside).

Dumbarton 1 , Berwick 0
SECOND division leaders Dumbarton snatched victory in injury time
after a moment of madness by Berwick skipper Mark Cowan.
The big centre half handled a Hugh Ward corner three minutes into
injury time. Ward took the kick himself and dispatched his twelfth goal
of the season home in style to stretch Dumbarton's unbeaten run to 11
games.
The Sons took time to settle and could have fallen behind early on
when firstly Martin Neil drove just over and then a header from Cowan
drifted inches past.
Tricky winger Ward showed his team-mates the way after 20 minutes when
he drifted past three men before firing wide. However, he should have
done better on the half hour when a bad pass-back allowed him a clear
run on goal, but his final shot was poor.
Visiting goalkeeper Young produced first-class saves from McKinnon and
substitute Meechan.
Fabiani of Dumbarton was booked along with Alan Banks and the
unfortunate Cowan of Berwick Rangers.
DUMBARTON -- MacFarlane, Gow, Fabiani, Hamilton, Martin, Marsland,
Mooney, King, Gibson, McKinnon, Ward. Substitutes -- Meechan, Campbell,
Dennison.
BERWICK RANGERS -- Young, Valentine, Banks, Fraser, Cowan, Reid,
Graham, Neil, Hawke, Irvine, Kane. Substitutes -- Forrester, King,
Osborne.
Referee -- R T Tait (East Kilbride).

THE threat to supermarkets from American-style warehouse clubs, which
sell a wide range of products in bulk packs at discount prices to
members, has evaporated with the decision of Nurdin &amp; Peacock to abandon
its Cargo Club format after just a year.
Nurdin is swallowing its pride and selling its three sites to
Sainsbury for #45m. The surplus on the deal will offset the start-up and
closure losses.
The group said Cargo Club exceeded expectations in respect of
membership but sales were disappointing. In addition, developing the
business would be difficult given the planning clamp-down on out-of-town
development. Instead, Nurdin will concentrate on its main business of
trade cash-and-carry outlets.
There is one remaining warehouse club operator, Costco, run by an
experienced American operator and the fact that it is not buying the
Nurdin outlets suggests that it is not finding a lot of business.

MANCHESTER United manager Alex Ferguson assessed the scale of the task
facing his side if they are to retain the championship and admitted:
''It's the biggest challenge we've ever had.''
Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Liverpool was a crushing blow to United's hopes
of a hat trick of titles, with Blackburn still six points clear with
just eight games to go.
As Ferguson prepared to send his side out against Arsenal at Old
Trafford tomorrow, he conceded it would take a supreme effort for United
to overhaul Kenny Dalglish's men.
''Sunday made things clear enough for us,'' said Ferguson, who
restores Andy Cole to the starting line-up -- with Lee Sharpe likely to
make way -- following a thigh strain.
''It is now straightforward. They have really got to go for it. Of all
the challenges we have had in the last four years I think this is the
biggest.''
Ferguson admitted the Anfield defeat had sent shockwaves around Old
Trafford and that his players were aware they simply had to beat the
Highbury side if they are keep the title race alive.
''It is an uphill fight, but the very nature of me resists all
temptation of giving in,'' said Ferguson.''
Meanwhile, Arsenal caretaker manager Stewart Houston faces a double
dilemma of his own.
Houston must keep the players' minds on ensuring Premiership survival
-- still no certainty -- while the distraction of their efforts to
retain the European Cup-winners' Cup continues, and keep his own mind
off the rash of rumours about his possible replacement at the club.
Speculation persists that Barcelona's Dutch master Johan Cruyff is
being lined up for Houston's Highbury job, but Arsenal chairman Peter
Hill-Wood has denied reports in the Spanish press that Cruyff has been
targeted.
* LIVERPOOL yesterday paid #2m to bring Millwall winger Mark Kennedy
to Anfield.

WEST Country trainer Jackie Retter can achieve her seventh success of
the season, courtesy of Miss Purbeck in the Exeter Handicap Hurdle at
her local track.
Miss Purbeck has made the frame just twice from seven outings, but at
least there were more encouraging signs on her latest outing, when
second to With Impunity at Chepstow.
Held up towards the rear of the seven-runner field, Miss Purbeck
closed on the leaders three from home and stayed on to go down by 15
lengths.
That itself might seem like a moderate effort, but several factors are
worth bearing in mind.
With the favourite Doualago performing dismally, it seemed that With
Impunity was left with a straightforward chance at the weights.
Add to that the fact that two-and-a-half miles -- the trip at Chepstow
-- is short of Miss Purbeck's best, and she looks to have a real chance
today.
The race looks to have attracted horses that are simply very slow
rather than confirmed stayers and Miss Purbeck is well worth a bet.

ALTHOUGH Britain's visible trade deficit with the non-European Union
countries widened in February to #343m from January's #291m, itself
revised down from #303m, this was in line with market projections and
caused no concern in financial markets.
The Central Statistical Office (CSO) said that the trend of the
visible balance, heavily influenced by the ''erratic'' December figure,
was almost flat. In December, the deficit had trebled to #903m.
Last month, exports rose 5% to a record #5200m while imports were up
6% at #5500m. The increase in the value of exports was largely due to
higher exports of crude oil and precious stones while the growth in
imports came largely from consumer and capital goods. Estimates of the
trend in value show both exports and imports increasing though
influenced by the December outcome. Exports decreased by 0.5% in the
three months to February while imports rose 5%.
After stripping out oil and the erratic items, the core deficit in
February widened to #406m from January's revised #122m.
On the same basis, in terms of volume there was a fall in the volume
of exports of 0.5% from January, while import volumes rose by 0.5%. Over
the three-month period, the volumes of exports fell by 2% and that for
imports increased by 1%.
The CSO says that the latest trends in volume (excluding oil and
erratics) show little change in exports and some sign of turning down in
imports.
Imports, though, having remained relatively subdued for most of the
year, do appear to have risen in recent months while exports have been
mixed. Without oil and erratics, the outcome for February is not that
encouraging, indicating that the trend is deteriorating as the recovery
sucks in more imports. And while the year-on-year shows export growth
continuing to outpace imports, this is not the case over the latest
quarterly period.
Analysts were divided on the implication of the figures but there was
relief that the December non-EU deficit was looking increasingly like a
blip as the Treasury maintains. And it is felt that so long as the oil
balance holds up, there could be falls in the headline deficit over the
year.
A bonus would be a slowdown in import growth over the coming months.
The weakness of sterling has made imports more expensive but on the plus
side it also helps exports.

Stenhousemuir 2,
Queen of the South 2
STENHOUSEMUIR started confidently, despite their recent run of poor
results, and went ahead from the first corner. Adrian Sprott sent the
ball over, and Clark, scored from 10 yards after nine minute.
Queens played some attractive football, but their finishing was weak.
In 30 minutes, trouble struck the visitors when Kennedy was
stretchered off with a leg injury, substitute McFarlane taking over.
Queens almost equalised when a long lob came back off the crossbar,
but they drew level in 36 minutes when Bryce shot home from close range.
The referee initially waved play on, but a linesman put up his flag and
a goal was awarded.
In 78 minutes, Stenhousemuir took the lead when Christie scored from
close range, but Jackson equalised for Queens with the last kick of the
game.
STENHOUSEMUIR -- Harkness, McNiven, Donaldson, Armstrong, McGeachie,
Christie, Steel, Clarke, Mathieson, Hutchison, Sprott. Substitutes --
Godfrey, Aitken, Toms (keeper).

AHEAD of what it hopes will be High Court clearance for its Leeds
Permanent merger, Halifax Building Society has reported 1994 results
which emphasise its financial strength.
The group is hoping for approval of the High Court early next week but
has contingency plans if the result is unexpectedly adverse. So the
timetable should not be thrown badly out if this does occur.
The High Court has to rule on whether any borrower or saver of less
than two years' standing is entitled to free shares under the 1986
Building Societies Act.
Meanwhile, Halifax reported profits 13% ahead at #975m for the year to
January, though this only reflected lower bad-debt provisions.
Its solvency ratio improved to 14.5%. This is considered unnecessarily
high for a retail banking business and the merged group could afford to
give away some #2000m to members when it is floated and still have an
adequate ratio.
Chairman Jon Foulds pointed out yesterday that it was better to float
a company while it was throwing off surplus capital. Members will have
to be patient because he warned yesterday that flotation was probably
two years away. The Halifax is convinced there will have to be other
mergers in the industry, which has excess capacity as a result of a
static housing market. Chief executive Mike Blackburn said: ''I'm not a
betting man but I might wager one or two more being announced later this
year.''
Two other major players, the Woolwich and the Alliance &amp; Leicester,
have indicated they are interested in mergers.
Mr Foulds believes the housing market will pick up eventually but not
before 1996 or even 1997.
Bad-debt provisions for 1994-95 were down sharply from #271m to #88m
but Halifax is doubtful the trend can be sustained if DSS income support
is reduced as currently proposed. The society is continuing to lobby
against the Government's proposal, arguing that it will not save money
in the long term as people dispossessed of their homes because they
can't pay their mortgage interest will still need state assistance to be
housed.
Despite the difficult market, Halifax's mortgage advances rose by 12%
to 208,000, though this was at the expense of margins as marketing costs
rose. The interest margin contracted from 2.32% to 2.13%. Total assets
grew 7% to #72bn.
The inflow from savers was hit in the first part of the year by large
sales of unit trusts but picked up in the second with the year's
increase of #2200m coming in better than expected.

WENDY Fraser, the Great Britain Olympic player and a winner throughout
her career, had to accept second best for the second time in four days
as coach of Hutchesons' Grammar School.
On Saturday Hutchesons' were beaten 1-0 by Heriot's in the Scottish
Schoolgirls Cup at St Andrews. And yesterday at Craiglockhart,
Hutchesons' lost out again by the same score again against Heriot's in
the final of the Caritas Sevens tournament.
Yesterday's defeat came on penalty strokes after stalemate had
prevailed during normal time when defences were very much in command.
Heriot's eventually won the penalty stroke competiton 2-1 with Katie
Struthers making the vital conversion.
In the early stages, Heriot's were by far the more forceful side but
then Hutchesons' gained the initiative. Unfortunately, Samantha Judge
and her colleagues were no more successful in breaking the deadlock than
the Heriot's attack had been earlier.
This was no great surprise, particularly as Heriot's had an
outstanding defender in Jenny Irvine, daughter of former Scotland and
Great Britain and British Lions fullback Andy Irvine. Results:
Semi-finals -- Hutchesons' 1, George Watsons's 0; Heriot's 1, Glasgow
High 1 (Heriot's won 3-2 on penalties).
Final -- Hutcheson's 0, Heriot's 0 (Heriot's won 2-1 on penalties).

Ross Finlay relishes the thought of a new MG
SINCE its launch at the Geneva show -- and even before that, thanks to
the antics of a magazine which blew the gaff by releasing confidential
press information a week early -- acres of prose and photographs are
being devoted to the striking MGF sports car, which will start appearing
in the showrooms this summer.
Few comments on the car have been as confusing as the one which hoped
it would be a ''good drive -- something its descendants never were''.
Setting aside the puzzle of how the most modern car of its line can
contrive to have descendants rather than predecessors, thousands of MG
owners past and present must resent the suggestion that Britain's most
famous ordinary-folk's sports car -- over seven decades, mind you -- was
always a dud to drive.
It is all very well getting carried away in print about being given a
shot in ''thinly-disguised racers'' costing half a million quid and
upwards, but the much lower-budget MG has done not badly in terms of
good drives over the years.
MGs were very successful in Scottish trials and speed hill climbs
during the 1930s. Later, rally drivers like John Milne, Logan Morrison,
Bill Shepherd and John Williamson competed with their own MGs on home
events before graduating to the internationals.
Ron Flockhart progressed from sand-racing an MG TC to driving a V16
BRM and twice winning for Ecurie Ecosse at Le Mans. Archie Scott-Brown
competed in a TD and then, despite physical disabilities which you would
have thought ruled out anything of the kind, raced the hairiest of
sports cars, and on his day could sort out the likes of Stirling Moss.
The Herald man I have most envied over the years was the chap who, so
the story goes, was once driven from Glasgow to Drymen by no less
overwhelming a personality than Tazio Nuvolari. That was around the time
Nuvolari won the 1933 tourist trophy race in Ulster, by the simple
expedient of breaking his class lap record seven times in an MG K3
magnette. Altogether, I join the legion of MG enthusiasts in hoping to
read no more of this ''no good drives'' nonsense.
After all that, the MGF is a glorious looking sports car with an
unexpectedly advanced specification. Design chief Gordon Sked, a Scot
from Perth, supervised the development of a car which has intrigued many
people by going for a mid-engine layout, as well as using the
interlinked hydragas suspension system invented by that most patrician
of British vehicle engineers, Dr Alex Moulton.
Two versions of Rover's highly regarded K-series engine are available.
The base model MGF 1.8i will use it in 120bhp form, which should allow a
0-60mph time of about 8.5 seconds and a test track maximum around
120mph. Coming on to the market later in the year, the VVC version has a
substantial boost to power and flexibility thanks to a variable valve
control system, which is fairly simple in theory but quite some feat to
put into metal. The 145bhp released by it is expected to give the VVC
model a 0-60mph time of seven seconds and a top speed around 130mph.
The interior looks well thought out and suitably sporty, although the
instrument colour scheme may take a little getting used to. Despite the
fact that the engine lies behind the cabin, the still farther back
luggage boot is of a pretty fair size.
Prices should be around #16,000 for the 1.8i and #18,500 for the
enhanced specification VVC. There has been no chance yet to drive either
of the cars, check their performance or test the new power steering by
which the designers set considerable store.
But all the motoring writers I know are very keen to get behind the
wheel of the new generation MG, the older ones among us to relive some
youthful flings, and go out on the open road again behind that historic
octagon badge.

CLYDE Petroleum is achieving what it should have done several years
ago -- it is producing oil on highly-economical terms and production is
likely to grow for the next 18 months or so.
But in 1997 there will be a pressing need to find an immediate source
of increased output from assured sources which creates the burning
problem as to what acquisition chairman Malcolm Gourlay has in mind.
Production costs last year fell 22% to #6.20 per barrel. This was one
of the best performances among the independents and was helped by a rise
in output of 55% to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
As usual, it was the Gryphon field in the North Sea where Clyde's
floating production vessel was a major factor in reducing expenses. The
first extensions of the Wytch Farm complex in Dorset also helped the
balance sheet.
In the immediate future, there will be production from the 7.5% stake
in the Andrew field. Clyde, like most other oil companies, is not
expecting the price to do much in the coming months other than to range
between $15 and $18 per barrel apart from the occasional
politically-inspired spike.
Prices last year averaged #9.98 per barrel, down about #1.75. However,
Clyde faces the problem that even if there is any improvement, it will
be whittled away by the increase in tax which will leave net earnings
probably not too different from those of 1994.
There was a swing from pre-tax losses of #28.8m into a #13.6m surplus.
Despite a possible 15% rise in production this year, helped by
additional Dutch gas coming on-stream, net earnings will show an
improvement of perhaps just #2m to #14m and earnings of about 3.5p per
share.
Acquisitions will be helped by the reduction in exploration
expenditure during the year -- activity is largely confined to Syria,
where progress is highly positive, and Yemen, where politics are highly
volatile.
Gearing at the year-end was 92% and should drop to about 66% this time
round before any corporate activity.
But the question remains as to whether Clyde shareholders would be
better off invested in a somewhat larger entity. After all, it has
reserves of 177 million barrels valued at just 90p per barrel with the
shares at 39p. It would be cheaper for a medium-size oil company to buy
the stock rather than to explore off its own balance sheet while giving
Clyde shareholders a more ample reward.
The dividend total is 1p with a 0.65p final for a 3.2% yield. Given
the underlying quality of the North Sea and Dutch assets, Clyde looks
like a stock to buy for the medium term.

A HIGH-risk move into smaller quoted Asian companies is being made by
Edinburgh-based fund management group Stewart Ivory, which is raising an
estimated #23.7m for a new investment trust. The Scottish Oriental
Smaller Companies Trust, whose launch was announced yesterday, will aim
for long-term capital growth through investment in companies in emerging
Asian markets with a market capitalisation of less than $500m (#316m).
Stewart Ivory, which runs the #459m Scottish American Investment Trust
(Saints) and has proven unit trust expertise in the Far East, will be
targeting Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, China and Taiwan.
Working on the basis of individual stock selection rather than asset
allocation, director Angus Tulloch and colleague Alistair Staddon, who
have both worked in the Far East, will attempt to cash in on neglected
smaller companies.
Explaining the thinking behind the launch, Mr Tulloch said: ''The
argument is not so much for the Asian region at the moment. It is
probably that smaller companies have been very much neglected. They have
disappointed, they have underperformed and the value is absolutely
incredible.''
With a strong belief that smaller Asian companies have underperformed
during the last five years but no definite evidence that the tide is
turning, Stewart Ivory views #23.7m as a good sum to begin with.
If the fund management group waited for proof that underperformance
was over, it would be too late to grasp the opportunity.
Dealing in Scottish Oriental's 25p Ordinary shares, issued at 100p,
and warrants, issued on a one-for-five basis and exercisable at 100p
between 1997 and 2007, is expected to commence next Wednesday.
With no payment of commission or fees to placees or intermediaries,
Stewart Ivory has capped launch costs at 1%.
Mr Tulloch believes this leaves far less scope for shares to commence
trading at a discount.

DESPITE an undoubted increase in people working from home, the basic
need for colleagues to communicate is a good reason to predict a healthy
future for the business conference trade.
It is becoming an increasingly sophisticated industry and competition
to attract this type of trade is growing.
Conferences come in all shapes and sizes. Although many of these
events are geared towards gatherings of between 50 and 100 delegates,
there is a trend towards holding larger gatherings.
In two years' time, Glasgow will host the World ASST (American Society
of Travel Agents) Congress, which will be attended by more than 7000
delegates. Also in 1997, Glasgow will host the Rotary International
Conference, a gathering of 25,000 delegates. The scale of such events
will obviously place enormous pressure on hotels in the west of
Scotland.
Conference accommodation problems, however, have been solved by the
need for universities to generate additional income. They have woken up
to the fact that, in the context of conferences, they are sitting upon a
commercial goldmine.
All of Scotland's universities -- Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews,
Aberdeen, Stirling, Dundee, Abertay, Strathclyde, Heriot Watt, Robert
Gordons, Glasgow Caledonian, Napier, and Paisley are seriously chasing
the business conference trade.
Older university dons might deprecate the fact that the sheltered
groves of academia have been forced to do this, but they cannot argue
against the commercial pressures which exist.
It is not just Glasgow and Edinburgh that can provide advanced
conference facilities. There is the Music Hall in Aberdeen, the Eden
Court Theatre in Inverness, the theatre/auditorium facilities at
Aviemore, the City Hall in Perth, the St Andrews Conference Bureau, an
institution which has been set up to promote the facilities which the
district has to offer; the Caird Hall in Dundee which can seat up to
2400 people, making it the city's largest conference venue; and many
more.
Last month it was announced that the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and
Convention Bureau had won the conference industry's ''Best UK Convention
Bureau'' award for the second year in succession.
It beat off competition from Edinburgh and Birmingham, both of which
were shortlisted in an annual poll of the readers of Meetings and
Incentive Travel, the meetings industry magazine. Over 10,000 votes were
cast.
GGTB chief executive Jack Munro remarked, ''to win this award among
such prestigious competition is a tremendous tribute to the
professionalism and dedication of our staff, and direct recognition by
the meetings and incentive industry of the quality and range of service
we offer.''
During last year, GGTB secured a record 222 new conferences worth over
#23m to the local economy, with bookings secured up to the year 2001.
The conference business is now worth more than #33m annually to the
Greater Glasgow area.
On the East Coast, the Sheraton Grand in Edinburgh has launched the
capital's first 24-hour business centre and introduced a range of
enhanced services aimed at business guests.
This new business centre offers credit card operated telephones and
fax machine, fax modem equipment, personal computers with printer and
even a high-speed shredder. General manager Michael Wade said: ''We
recognise that the majority of our guests come to Edinburgh on business.
We have had the basic business equipment available for several years
now, but never before on a 24-hour basis.''

Facilities are supported by spacious foyers, exhibition and catering
areas, and a range of break-out rooms
THE success of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre can be
largely attributed to the venue realising the commercial potential of
staging conferences with an associated exhibition.
The SECC, now open 10 years, occupies a landscaped site on the banks
of the River Clyde, and has five halls of varying sizes.
Hall One is the designated conference auditorium fitted with tiered
and flat-linked seats for up to 2000 delegates, with Hall Two doubling
as an exhibition area or as a catering or registration area for Hall
One. Hall Three is a medium-sized exhibition area connected to Hall Two
by means of a retractable partition wall and Hall Four is the SECC's
largest hall, with exhibition space which can be converted to
accommodate up to 8500 conference delegates.
Hall Five can be used as a separate exhibition area or, by opening the
partition wall, it may be used in conjunction with Hall Four to provide
a large exhibition space. It will also provide seating for more than
3000 conference delegates.
There have been subsequent developments since the SECC was first
completed in 1985. The ability to stage conferences is to be enhanced by
a #30m investment aimed at upgrading the centre's conference facilities.
Scheduled to open in 1997, a purpose-built auditorium with the potential
to seat 3200 delegates and complete with full supporting infrastructure,
will be built to complement the existing halls described above.
It is not just large conferences that this new centre will host. All
sizes may be accommodated, with the auditorium dividing into two halls
capable of accomodating 1800 and 1000 delegates.
In autumn this year, the Edinburgh International Conference Centre
(EICC) opens. This centre will provide international standard
purpose-built meeting facilities in the heart of the city, just five
minutes' walk from Princes Street.
The main auditorium will provide raked seating for 1200 delegates in
theatre style. This main auditorium can be sub-divided into three
separate and self-contained auditoria for 600, 300, and 300 people.
On the exhibition/banqueting level will be 1200 sq m of space for
exhibitions.
An altogether different arena -- Hampden Park -- is now opening its
doors to the business community. The national football stadium in the
southside of Glasgow is the latest sporting establishment to offer
conference and corporate hospitality packages.
Lounges in the new North Stand can accommodate 220 people for dinner,
400 in a theatre-style setting and 500 for a stand-up buffet, but
smaller gatherings can also be easily catered for.
Three miles from the city centre with free parking, the Hampden
facilities have lift and stair access. There's a reception hall, secure
cloakrooms, a bar area -- and an impressive view of the pitch.

Aileen Little looks at a new work for the girls of Mary Erskine's
ONE suspects Robert Louis Stevenson would have been genuinely pleased
with an Edinburgh school's recent choice of composer to orchestrate A
Child's Garden of Verses.
To celebrate its tercenenary , the Mary Erskine School has
commissioned Howard Blake, of The Snowman fame, to compose The Land of
Counterpane for choir and orchestra -- culmination of a gala concert
scheduled for March 25 in the Usher Hall.
Blake, whose prolific output totals 475 works, recognises in Stevenson
the same sense of wonder as in The Snowman: ''The Verses do capture a
child's vision. I decided to set them simply, as they are, and get the
orchestra to do the rest.''
Ironically, Howard Blake's TV work for Channel 4 (The Snowman and
Grandpa) are all most people know about him. The composer takes a
philosophical view: ''A violin concerto takes longer to get accepted
into the repertoire . TV is ephemeral. I just write whatever comes up;
one reaches different types of public.''
It would be wrong to assume, however, because 57-year-old Blake is by
and large a ''serious'' composer, that his liaison with Channel 4 was in
some way out of character. On the contrary: he is in love with film,
always has been. After graduating from the Royal Academy Blake took
two-and-a-half years out of music altogether and worked for the National
Film Theatre as a projectionist. Work as a session pianist for EMI and
Decca led to writing music for films, and he notched up such successes
as The Avengers, The Duellists (special jury award at Cannes), and A
Month in the Country (British Film Institute award for musical
excellence).
Patches of intense commercial activity have been interspersed with
periods of reflection and religious comtemplation; during one, he
stopped taking commissions, retired to the countryside, and produced a
number of devotional works such as his Festival Mass and Songs of the
Nativity.
It is this versatility which has enabled Blake to join the ranks of an
elite few capable of earning a good living from composition. Curiously,
although he is no stranger to writing for young people, the Mary Erskine
commission is the first from a school. He needed some persuasion -- for
one thing, he worried that A Child's Garden of Verses was too twee for a
modern audience. But the school's principal pointed out, tongue in
cheek, that such considerations hadn't bothered Mahler. And, in fact,
what Blake has produced is a Mahler-esque song cycle for full orchestra
and chorus incorporating a prologue and epilogue spoken over the music.
The latter is to be read by actor David Rintoul.
Mary Erskine's head of music, Helen Mitchell, describes Blake's
orchestration as ''superb, very atmospheric, and beautiful to play.''
The performers, who include 300 singers aged between 10 and 17 (the
Junior School is involved in the choir, just as boys from the twinned
Stewart's/Melville College swell the orchestra), are reportedly loving
it.
News of Howard Blake's orchestration has already reached the ears of
several companies eager to translate the poems into film. Meantime, it's
more than fitting that what Stevenson called his ''ragged regiment'' of
verses has been transformed into song. ''They seem to me,'' wrote the
poet prophetically, ''to have a kind of childish treble note that sounds
in my ears freshly.''

MANY small businesses in Scotland have been hit by a rating scam.
Leading rating consultants warn that there has been a growth in the
number of firms purporting to be rating experts, but who in fact are not
qualified to provide such a service.
Many of these firms offer to conduct an appeal against rating
assessment in return for a deposit. The client never hears from the
rating expert again -- telephone lines are found to be discontinued,
offices are abandoned, the deposit is lost for ever and no appeal is
lodged.
Others are honest in their intention, but simply lack the professional
skill to carry out a successful appeal.
Tthe Glasgow office of chartered surveyors Colliers Erdman Lewis have
issued the following hints on what to look for.
The use of professional salesmen rather than rating practitioners to
obtain initial instructions from potential clients; claims of
''guaranteed'' percentage reductions on particular properties, often
accompanied by mysterious ''preliminary reports''; fees charged up
front, with a promise to return them if the appeal is unsuccessful and
soliciting instructions from companies that already have their own
rating advisers.
Only members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS),
the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers (ISVA) an the
Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation (IRRV) have the necessary
guaranteed levels of training and qualification awarded by examination.

BEHIND the words of Women of Troy is an almost unbearable reality.
Reading the National's programme note with quotes from, amongst others,
Tony Harrison, Edward Bond, and the diary of a young Sarajevo girl, you
get a real sense of the moral indignation informing Annie Castledine and
Annabel Arden's production of Euripides's fierce anti-war play. Sadly
it's an indignation that comes through only in spasms.
Women of Troy is a great oratorio of anguish. Hecuba, the vanquished
queen of Troy, her ''mad'', prophetic daughter Cassandra, and
Andromache, her daughter-in-law (and the chorus) bemoan the Fates in
vast set torrents of emotion. The experience is common still to defeated
women round the globe: loss of husbands, sons, and brothers, loss of a
beloved city, humiliation, exile.
If ever there was a play made for this Greek-inspired auditorium
(based on the amphitheatre at Epidaurus), this is it and Iona McLeish
succeeds triumphantly in visually realising it. Helicopters whirr
overhead, pillars of fire shoot into the sky at the back of McLeish's
twisted concrete and steel-fencing set -- a design that suggests both
the crumbling ruins of some ancient site, the scarred remains of a
modern city, and a twentieth-century football stadium -- the venue for
so many acts of political barbarity.
Less successful is the human element. Castledean and Arden's shock
tactics -- turning Greek soldiers into American GI's, Helen of Troy into
a Marilyn Monroe-ish figure and Menelaus into a southern drawling
American admiral -- only partly succeed in contemporising Euripides. It
is left to Rosemary Harris's noble, distraught Hecuba to scale the
heights through the words.

SECURITY might seem elusive in these days of stock-market
uncertainties, so it might come as a surprise that it is very much on
offer. How does a guaranteed annual return of 7.5% sound, tax free and
with all your capital returned at the end of the investment period?
Save &amp; Invest, the one-stop shop for financial advice based in
Glasgow's Hope Street, is more than happy to recommend guaranteed
products for those who seek absolutely no-risk investments.
Two in particular strike Managing Director Jeffrey Deans as attractive
examples of a financial services market coming up with products to suit
individual needs.
One is a Personal Equity Plan run by Scottish Amicable, the other a
guaranteed distribution bond offered by General Accident Life. Both
offer cast-iron guarantees: your investment is safe, the income or
growth is clearly explained, and you are guaranteed to get all your cash
back.
''Guaranteed investments appeal to many people,'' says Deans,
''especially perhaps to people to have taken redundancy or early
retirement and wish to make the most of their lump sum without taking
any chances, as they see it.
''My job is to assess the market continually for the best products on
offer, and these two certainly qualify.''
Scottish Amicable's PEP is among the first to offer a guarantee of
income and capital. Those investing a lump sum of #12,000 or over will
receive 7.65% net of tax each year, with the guarantee that the original
capital will be returned in December 2000.
Should the investment be slightly lower, from #5000 to #11,999, the
return is 7.5% per annum. For a standard-rate taxpayer (25%), that
equates to 10%, and for an investor paying tax at 40% it is equivalent
to a remarkable 12.5%.
Monthly income can also be obtained, at slightly lower rates. And
there is a growth option under which no income is taken at all.
Again, this is absolutely guaranteed and it means the #12,000-plus
investor can look forward to a 51% increase in capital, or 50% if the
amount is #5000-#11,999. Minimum investment is #3000 and the rates
remain attractive, with the growth guarantee, for example, being 46%.
This return is also, of course, free of tax.
This is subject to no withdrawals having been made. Investors can
forget about fluctuating levels of income, and in the value of their
capital: they know exactly where they stand.
There is a time element with the guaranteed PEP, which came on offer
earlier this month and is available only until close of business on
April 13. Anyone who hasn't taken out a PEP for the 1994/5 tax year will
have to act even faster, with the application and cheque requiring to be
submitted by 5pm next Tuesday (March 28).
There is also a bonus for those who do this: the equivalent of an
extra month's income to reflect this early investment.
Jeffrey Deans feels would-be investors should also realise that the
PEP is a particularly attractive limited offer which could be
oversubscribed, in which case it would be withdrawn and the opportunity
missed.
He and his team of independent advisers are always available at the
Hope Street premises to talk over this and other investment products.
The other guaranteed investment they strongly recommend is General
Accident's guaranteed distribution bond.
This one offers a rising income over the next five-and-a-half years,
with the initial capital being returned in October 2000. There is also a
payment equivalent to any increase in the ft-se index over that period,
on 20% of the capital. So if the index were to increase by 25% over the
five-and-a-half years of the investment, an investment of #10,000 would
draw an extra #500.
The reason for this is that 20% of the original capital has been
invested for growth at the outset, with the remaining 80% going towards
buying a high and rising income. The percentage paid is 7.5, 7.75, 8,
8.5, and 9 per year from years one to five, paid half-yearly, on that
80%. Quarterly payments are available at a reduced rate. The returns
quoted are net of basic-rate tax so 25% taxpayers have no further tax to
pay.
As with the Scottish Amicable PEP, there is a growth option with
General Accident's bond, with investors selecting this at the outset and
choosing to take all their benefits at the end of the investment term.
The guarantee is that their capital will have grown to 140%, with the
additional amount, which depends on the increase in the ft-se 100 index,
still payable. With a closing date of April 12, or earlier if fully
subscribed, prompt action is advisable.

SOMETIMES it's not just hopeful purchasers who respond after a house
is advertised for sale.
When the unusually named Barone at No.7 West Chapelton Crescent in
Bearsden was put on the market recently, there was an immediate call
from a local resident who had once known the architect. She even
reported where he had lived in Bearsden, along with information about
his family.
Duncan McNaughton designed the house in 1911 in the Glasgow style, and
fortunately it has survived for more than 80 years without too much
tinkering or interference to its overall design.
The meticulous attention paid to such matters as the woodwork or even
simple details like opening the windows can still be marvelled at.
Despite the passage of time his remarkable yet simple devices that allow
the glass to open for easy cleaning remain in perfect working order.
In the sitting room the large original bay windows swing open by
pulling down the upper panes. On sunny days this allows fresh air and
sunshine to stream in.
The fireplace is set in an original Glasgow-style wood surround that
extends over one wall. It includes a hand-painted overmantle showing
Highland scenes, and two side cupboards set with leaded glass panes. One
of the cupboards is surprisingly large, while the other is a simple
press.
In the dining room the windows again distinguish this beautiful villa.
A turret at the corner of the building creates an oriel window in the
dining room and in the bedroom above.
The spacious lounge has a matching bay window with a fine view over
the garden and surrounding trees.
Understandably, the once grandly-labelled morning room has been
converted into a kitchen, and the original kitchenis now a laundry and
utility room.
A pretty touch of contemporary styling has added twentieth-century
practicality to the kitchen, with a Laura Ashley rouched blind at the
window and toning striped paper. The pale cream units surround the pine
breakfasting table and chairs. Even here the original door with its
circular window remains.
Across the hall is a useful downstairs cloakroom.
The wide stairs have another delightful window at their mid-point with
four leaded panels featuring butterflies in brilliant shades of blue.
There are also four double bedrooms including a large master bedroom
overlooking the garden at the back of the house, with its own vanity
basin.
The bathroom has green deco-style tiles trimmed with black, and a
white suite.
Perhaps the most unusual feature of Barone is the basement, though the
present owners admit they have not really explored its full potential.
Because the building is on a slope, the basement is actually the ground
floor when viewed from the back elevation.
Its two large rooms have a separate entrance from the garden and could
easily be converted into a flat or incorporated into the house as a gym
or games room or office. It even has a loo and two splendidly massive
china sinks with their old brass taps.
To the side of the house is a brick garage, with the drive passing
under the welcoming arch of two interwoven trees. Just like the rest of
the house, they have clearly been lovingly tended over the years.

over #225,000.

SCOTLAND'S Martin Heath, who had come through three qualifying rounds,
produced a spirited performance before going out to Del Harris in
yesterday's Leekes British Open championships at the Cardiff
International Arena.
The pair were poles apart in terms of experience, but the 21-year-old
Scot kept Harris on court for 53 minutes before losing 15-13, 15-13,
15-9.
Harris is a twice British champion while Heath is in his first full
season as a professional. Heath forged a 9-5 lead, but in a crucial
turning point, Harris took the next seven points.
He was never behind in the second game as Heath's three qualifying
rounds took their toll.
Peter Nicol, Scotland's world No.5, plays his first-round match today
against French qualifier Julien Bonetat, while the only Scottish woman,
Senga Macfie, makes her entrance against England's Donna Vardy.

SUSPICION that the problem of mis-selling pensions may be greater than
originally thought mounted yesterday following a disclosure from the
Prudential, Britan's biggest life insurer, that it has made an
undisclosed provision to cover among other things claims from aggrieved
policyholders.
It has set up three teams of 30 people, including one based in
Glasgow, to contact 600,000 employed personal pension policyholders.
This represents half its total number.
The Prudential has about a 10% share of the UK personal pension market
and estimates that it could spend as much as #20m over a period of a
couple of years on processing the paperwork associated with the
policyholders.
Prudential's chairman Sir Brian Corby said that following the
Securities and Investment Board's (SIB) report in October the company
felt it would be ''right and prudent to increase our provisions''. It is
currently awaiting SIB guidance on how best to address the relevant
policyholders.
However, Sir Brian emphasised that the whole issue of mis-selling was
a manageable problem for the Pru and would ''not be material to the
Prudential's results''. This was said in the context of the #30bn total
set aside to cover all its long-term liabilities.
He noted that as far back as the 1988 annual report he had said that
it was not necessarily right for people to opt out of occupational
pension schemes. The fact is that not many people understand about
pensions, including some of those who sell them.
Therefore, it is not surprising that its sales force will have been
able to persuade some people to switch out of more beneficial
occupational pension schemes.
News of the enlarged provisions came as the Prudential revealed that
the bad publicity surrounding the pensions issue had led to a sharp drop
in its life assurance sales.
However, this was offset to some extent by strong growth in sales of
personal equity plans. The Prudential benefited from its wide spread of
business in different sectors and countries. This helped its annual
profits for 1994 to show a 2% improvement to #603m before tax.
The general insurance business performed strongly helped by better
underwriting, lower costs, relatively good weather and lower theft
claims. Overseas, the Jackson National Life business in the US was hit
by a lower level of investment gains and profits dropped by 12%.
However, new product launches helped its sales to increase.
Profits from Asia doubled and the Prudential is busy expanding its
presence in this dynamic economic region. Representative offices have
been opened in China and Vietnam.
The total dividend was raised by 9.1% to 14.4p reflecting the board's
confidence about the future and the performance of the business. Perhaps
not surprisingly, sales of annual premium insurance products in the
first two months of 1995 are down on the same time last year.
Prudential's shares at 322p, down 10[1/2]p, yield 5.6%.
The Prudential is keen to play down talk of a major rift with the
regulatory authorities following the high profile resignation of former
chief executive Mick Newmarch. Incoming chief executive Peter Davis, who
was most recently chairman of Reed Elsevier, will be hoping for a more
harmonious working environment when he takes up his post on May 1.
Mr Davis is to receive a #400,000 salary but no share options. The
Prudential has decided to abandon its share option scheme for directors
and executives and replace it with a ''restricted share plan''. The
criteria for eligibility will depend on above average performance over a
three year period. Mr Davis is on an initial two-year contract and
thereafter is subject to a one year notice period.
Although Mr Davis has no managerial experience in the financial
services industry, Sir Brian said his business acumen, experience at the
helm of a large public company and contribution he has made to the
Prudential as a non-executive director, ''make him an excellent
choice''.
Sir Brian added that Mr Davis' very good management track record in
marketing and consumer businesses ''will add a new dimension to the
Prudential's work''.

JOHN Menzies took a bold step into the fast-moving European multimedia
market yesterday, agreeing to pay up to #24.9m for an initial 37% stake
in Funsoft of Germany.
The acquisition, through the Edinburgh-based group's Total Home
Entertainment distribution division, also opens up new markets for THE's
existing video, audio and literary products.
With Germany commanding about 29% of the European market for personal
computer-based CD-ROM, which offers everything from educational
programmes to hi-tec action games, privately-owned Funsoft is a leading
distributor and publisher.
THE will exclusively distribute Funsoft's products in the UK, thus
realising its objective of becoming a major force in the distribution,
marketing and publishing of home entertainment and multimedia products
throughout Europe.
A high-volume but low-margin division, THE, with an annual turnover of
between #160m and #170m, is an important part of John Menzies, which the
public tends to associate more with High Street retail outlets.
Commenting on the acquisition, group managing director Ranald
Noel-Paton said: ''It is an extremely important move both strategically
and immediately, in terms of the impact on our earnings per share and
the financial performance of the John Menzies group.
''THE's profits will be enhanced by access to this wider market but
also by its participation in this fast-moving CD-ROM field.''
John Menzies, whose shares put on 2p to 512p, made clear its minority
stake in Funsoft was a step towards control. The group, which is using
its cash base to finance the acquisition, has an option to purchase a
further 14% of Funsoft before the end of 1997.
With its eyes on France, the third-largest market for CD-ROM behind
Germany and the UK, Mr Noel-Paton said the group would seek to develop
aggressively from the strong platform provided by Funsoft.
The Dusseldorf-based company has well-established distribution
operations within Austria, Switzerland, Holland and Belgium. It made
pre-tax profits of #3.4m in the year to December 1993 but has since
achieved significant growth in turnover and earnings.
John Menzies expects the rapidly-expanding European multimedia
software market, which has been doubled in the last year by sales of
compatible personal computers, to be worth #1500m by the year 2000.
Funsoft's joint managing directors, who will retain significant
shareholdings, have signed five-year service agreements. They will be
joined on the board by THE chairman and Menzies director Dermot
Jenkinson and THE managing director Alan Taylor.
The purchase is subject to approval by the German Federal Cartel
Office.

SCOTLAND'S junior women, led by Forfar's Julia Ewart, kept the home
nation's 100% record alive at the Bank of Scotland World Junior
championships yesterday in Perth with a nail-biting 6-5 win over Canada.
This game, which the Scots finally won by stealing a single shot in
the last end, gave Ewart five wins out of five and followed a much more
comfortable 8-4 win over Germany.
In the game against Canada, Scotland had a good start, scoring two at
the first end and following that with a single shot in the third after
Canada blanked the second end.
Canada clawed their way back and pushed their noses in front at the
eighth end when they scored two for a 5-4 lead, but the Scots responded
immediately, drawing level in the ninth with a single shot.
In the tenth, Canada had last-stone advantage, but Ewart raised her
own stone to lie two to put the pressure on while the Canadian skip
twice hit and rolled out when, particularly at the second time of
asking, a more straightforward shot might have produced a better result.
This Canadian misjudgment gave the Scots a steal of one from the end
and overall victory.
Not to be outdone, Tom Brewster, of Lockerbie, led the Scottish men to
an equally impressive 5-0 record with a 5-4 victory over Sweden in his
only game yesterday, which was decided by a measure in Scotland's favour
in the last end. Details:
Women. Fifth round -- Switzerland 9, Japan 2; Norway 4, Czech Republic

FOUR Scots are victims of Scottish Claymore's head coach Lary
Kuharich's first cut.
Pat Shields, Don Edmonston, John Letham, and Gary McNey have been
dropped from the team taking part in a pre-season training camp in
Georgia, prior to the start of the World League season on April 8.
The cut, in which six Americans also were dropped, leaves three Scots,
Scott Couper, Stephen McCusker, and Ben Torriero fighting for their
professional futures.
However, the door has been opened to three of home-based replacements.
Paul Balfour, from Glasgow, Aberdeen's Darren Chapman, and Andy Meikle
-- who all missed out on the trip to the US -- have been told to be on
standby when the squad returns to Edinburgh later this month.
The fourth replacement is already at the camp, Canadian kicker Derek
Noble, who holds a British passport and originally comes from Castlemilk
in Glasgow.
For McNey, who took a four-month break from his job as a Strathclyde
bus driver, the news was devastating. ''I thought something like this
was going to happen when the coach brought in the Canadian guy before
our match with Barcelona on Saturday,'' he said.

THE publicity surrounding executive pay was undoutedly behind the
publication yesterday by the Institute of Directors (IoD) of a guide on
how to be a good company director. The guide, Good Practice for
Directors -- Standards for the Board, is presented in three related
sections: organising and running the board, tasks of the board and
indicators of good practice, and building an effective board.
It hopes that implementation of some of the advice in the booklet will
enable companies to enhance their competitive performance and place then
at a greater advantage when seeking to justify generous executive pay
and perks.
The guide is the result of about three years research with input from
companies of all sizes, carried out by the Henley management centre.
One can think of many companies who would benefit from using such a
guide, most recently retail group Kingfisher which has sacked some key
members of its board and carried out a thorough review of the poor
performers within its business portfolio, namely Comet and Woolworths.
In a frank admission, Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the IoD
and former chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society said he
would have benefited from such a guide when he assumed his first
directorship 10 years ago.
Some of the guidance can be tailored to suit directors of non-profit
organsiations such as educational trusts and health boards.
* Good Practice for Directors -- Standards for the Board was sponsored
by the Department of Employment and is available from the IoD priced
#31.50 or #26.50 formembers of the institute.

NICOSIA: A farmer jailed by a British court in Cyprus for growing
potatoes near a firing range ended a 13-day hunger strike, a spokesman

Xylophagou village near the UK base of Dhekelia, was sentenced on March
9 to 132 days in jail for refusing to heed a court order prohibiting him
from growing potatoes near the range and not paying a fine of #200. He

Michael Tumelty is looking forward to the bash as the SCO celebrates
its coming of age.
REMEMBER your 21st birthday party? Well, OK, the early hours of it
then? All those mates, crowded house, scarcely room to sling a gin? The
Scottish Chamber Orchestra faced an unusual problem when deciding what
to do about its own 21st bash next Tuesday.
After all, its mates, fans and supporters are all over the country.
And it has so many artists associated with it -- two conductors where
some orchestras have one, two composers where most orchestras have none
-- that to accommodate everyone would suggest a logistical nightmare.
Problems are there to be solved, so the SCO has hired the Usher Hall
in Edinburgh, booked a fleet of buses, and will transport 1000 of its
subscribers from Glasgow, Aberdeen, Perth, and St Andrews for the big
bash. The fans will be deposited first at the Sheraton Hotel, where they
will be plied with champagne.
For the concert itself, the orchestra has booked both of its
conductors, Sir Charles Mackerras and Ivor Bolton, who will share the
platform. Old friends, such as flautist James Galway, will drop in for a
swift pint of Mozart. And the orchestra's two resident composers will
both be represented: James MacMillan with a brand-new work and Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies with his riotous musical portrait of progressive
inebriation, Orkney Wedding.
The concert will culminate with a performance of Handel's Fireworks
Music, with indoor fireworks by Wilf Scott, who choreographs the annual
Edinburgh Festival fireworks display on the castle. Thereafter, the
party may become a trifle blurred . . .
Festivities aside, where stands the Scottish Chamber Orchestra at 21?
As a callow youth it seemed to strike a refined pose with a diet
principally of baroque and classical music. Several living composers
were associated with it, but its first 10 years or so produced only a
handful of commissions.
Then, in its early teens, the 37-strong orchestra began to stretch its
limbs. An association, which was to prove seminal, was struck up with
Peter Maxwell Davies who, not long before, had been the bad boy of the
British music scene, outraging everyone from vicars to politicians.
Max had moved to Scotland for a bit of peace to write his music and
instead ended up closely associated with the SCO, producing for them --
to date -- a symphony, nine concertos, and a raft of other compositions.
Key administrative appointments -- Ian Ritchie as managing director
and Kathryn McDowell -- took the SCO, for some more conservative
observers, seriously towards delinquency. Under the aegis of these two,
a radical development programme was evolved which took the orchestra out
of the concert-hall and into the community, servicing facets of society
that wouldn't have known an orchestra if it hit them in the face.
As Ian Ritchie began to question the function of an orchestra in late
twentieth-century society, and the SCO's development programme -- which
was to bring it international renown and the Prudential Award for the
Arts, the richest arts prize in Britain -- took root and flourished in
the late eighties, something happened.
There was a suspicion that the SCO was becoming involved in unorthodox
activities to the detriment of its effectiveness as a concert-giving
orchestra. If this was true, the appointment in 1989 of James Clark as
leader set in motion a counterbalance that has led to the SCO, as a
concert orchestra, having today almost unparalleled confidence and
strength. Clark is a powerhouse of influence: stunning violinist,
exceptional leader.
The balance between development and concert work is something that
occupies the SCO's present managing director Roy McEwan. ''We're trying
to find a better balance,'' he said, ''but we haven't found it yet;
we're not quite there.''
The development department of the orchestra, said McEwan, is going
through a watershed. He's set to make a key appointment following which,
he said, the development work should come more into focus with the other
activities of the orchestra.
You'd have to be deaf, daft, or terminally prejudiced not to recognise
the quality and versatility of the SCO's concert-giving activities
today. One recent programme told the story of its versatility: three
works spanning three centuries. And the orchestra was as authentic and
convincing in very old music as it was in a new work being unveiled that
evening.
In another recent programme, where the SCO got its hooks into the
sensational conductor Joseph Swensen, the band produced an account of
Beethoven's Eroica symphony that would have held its ground against any
other performance in the UK. Or anywhere.
In its chief, and unstoppable, guest conductor, Sir Charles Mackerras,
69, the SCO has a stickman who is an authority in just about everything
he touches. Relationships with composers Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and
James MacMillan are set to continue -- MacMillan will produce three new
works for the SCO over the next three years.
Expect relationships to be developed with other composers too, said
Roy McEwan, naming Sally Beamish and Alasdair Nicolson as two the SCO
has its eye on. And expect, too, the concept of collaboration -- a new
word on the Scottish orchestral scene, previously a battleground of
territoriality -- to be taken further.
This season, the SCO, together with the Royal SNO and BBC SSO, have
undertaken their first ever collaborative series in Perth. Geographical
horizons are about to be broadened, said Roy McEwan, hinting at future
joint ventures in Aberdeen and Glasgow.
All of this is to come. But first the party. Now where did I leave my
tie?

STERLING continued its rehabilitation in the currency markets.
It failed to be stirred by news of the resignation of Rupert
Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England.
Analysts said the scandal would not affect UK central bank policy.
Sterling gained half-a-cent against the dollar to $1.5845 and rose 0.2
on a trade-weighted basis to 84.8.
The German mark continued to be the subject of profit-taking which
allowed other European currencies to make headway. The pound rose almost
over 2[1/2] pfennigs against the mark to DM2.2420 and the Italian lira
and Spanish peseta also improved against the mark. However, dealers are
not convinced that the mark's rise has been capped for good.
Concerns about the domestic political situation in Italy, France and
UK remains. ''This is just the mark taking a breather. Nothing's out of
the woods yet,'' said an economist at DKB International in London.
The dollar recovered from an earlier new post-war low against the
Japanese yen. It was helped by comments from central bankers and
ministers about the undervaluation of the currency. However, publication
today of the US trade report for January could see the dollar lose out
to the mark if the deficit is more than $9000m.

PACKAGING giant Bowater insulated itself against rapidly rising raw
material prices and lifted profits by #14m to #226m in last year. Some
products such papers and plastics as well as resins as rose by more than
50% and others more than doubled. This was caused in part by increased
demand from Asia in particular and through capacity restrictions.
Chief executive David Lyon said Bowater tried to pass them on
immediately but met resistance in the food, drink, and consumer related
industries. But overall, there was cost recovery within four to six
weeks.
Turnover at the continuing activities rose 12% to #2210m while
operating profits increased by 17% thanks to a general improvement in
the markets into which Bowater sells. That has come about through the
disposal of low performing businesses and the acquisition of those which
would show long term potential.
There was a good performance in UK cheque printing, reflecting the
recovery in the economy as there was at commercial printing. However,
lottery printing saw a setback from increasing competition around the
world with Bowater missing out on the UK National Lottery.
Coated products saw a slight decrease in margins due partly to weak
demand for book covers in the US.
Overall group margins improved from 9.7% to 10%.
In 1994, Bowater spent a total of #121m on acquisitions. In
particular, it continued its expansion into packaging for health and
beauty products.
The dividend total has been raised 10% to 13.8p with an 8p final. The
shares closed 6p better at 432p where they yield 4%.

Stewart MacIntosh examines the possible effects of next month's new
business ratings on the Scottish commercial property market.
By having to pay empty rates companies are going to be burdened with
crippling bills.
THE property industry is bracing itself for the introduction of
''empty rates''. From the beginning of April, many commercial premises
which have been empty for three months or more will have a bill for 50%
of their normal rates slapped on them, the first time this has happened
in Scotland.
It has been estimated that the new charge will cost the Scottish
property industry some #100m per year. South of the border where empty
rates have been in operation for years, many landlords vandalise
buildings to make them unusable -- and ineligible for ''empty rates''.
But Scottish landlords who want to avoid the charge of institutionalised
vandalism could slash their bills for ''empty rates'' by up to 60%, and
at the same time earn brownie points for contributing to charity.
Chartered surveyors Montagu Evans have come up with a radical proposal
to help businesses avoid the worst of the new system.
The firm suggests that by allowing charitable organisations to use
empty premises free of charge, ''empty rates'' bills would be reduced to
20%, rather than 50% to be applied to most empty properties.
Ratings partner Tony McRitchie said: ''This new system will hit many
companies extremely hard. By having to pay empty rates for the first
time they are going to be burdened with crippling additional bills.''
He suggests that landlords of large empty properties should allow
charities to operate from their premises. ''If you were to allow a
charity to occupy your premises on monthly licences, free of charge, the
properties would only be liable for 20% rates, as they have charitable
occupiers. This would not reduce the rating burden completely but would
cut it by more than half.''
He believes that this is the first time such a solution has been
proposed and says that there is an obvious attraction for charities in
getting free use of city centre properties.
He commends this solution as preferable to the one taken by many
property dealers and developers in England. ''They have simply removed
roofs, windows and anything that can make the building uninhabitable and
therefore no longer liable for rates,'' he says.
From April the 50% charge will be levied on empty factories,
warehouses, office blocks and even schools. Homes are exempt.
Many companies could secure a reduction in the business rates they pay
over the next five years by checking and challenging business rate
valuations and assessment over the next few months.
Companies will need to know whether or not their own individual rating
assessment is accurate -- and whether they should appeal against it.
A new booklet ''The Commercial Property Rates -- A Directors Guide''
has been published by the Institute of Directors and chartered surveyors
Herring Barr Rating, a company owned jointly by James Barr &amp; Son and
London based Herring Baker Harris. The booklet aims to help directors to
plan and control the cost of rates to their business and explains how to
check the accuracy of rating valuations.
Colin Hunter, director in charge of James Barr &amp; Son's rating
division, said: ''It is possible, with good professional advice, to
challenge a rating assessment successfully. Our experience shows that
virtually all appeals for the 1990 revaluation resulted in reductions in
rate liability for our clients' properties.''
The value of a well-negotiated rating assessment is illustrated by the
savings made by companies major like BhS and Caledonian Paper.
After appeal Caledonian Paper's proposed rateable value of #2.34
million was reduced to #1.8 million -- a 23% reduction which produced
savings of #1.425 million. After negotiation, BhS saw its proposed
rateable value of #1.2 million reduced to #500,000 -- a 58.33% reduction
with savings of #2.3 million.
Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the IoD said: ''Business rates
are a heavy burden particularly for small/medium sized businesses. It is
essential that directors understand the system and know how to check and
challenge assessments to ensure that they control the cost of rates to
their business.''

DEALING with roof problems at an early stage can lead to major savings
later.
It can take years for water to rot wood, and by the time it is
detected, major damage could be done. Preventative measures to halt the
effects of condensation can also save heartache and money.
Whether you need to know more about the proper ventilation of your
roof space or replacing your tiles, a reputable specialist firm will be
happy to give sound advice free of charge, and will offer a competitive
estimate for carrying out any work that may be necessary.
Specialist builders Strathbell have moved to bigger premises, their
expansion fuelled by increased business in their niche market.
The firm is expert in the production of fully insulated
conservatories, incorporating a tiled or slated roof, walls and a floor,
which provide minimum heat loss and can be used all year round.
The move to the new premises was preceded by a celebration --
Strathbell won a prestigious Marley Roofing Products award for
excellence in roofing work. The award was presented to directors Stephen
Robertson and Bob Laverty at a Federation of Master Builders dinner by
William Orr, Provost of Renfrew District, just before Strathbell moved
into a newly-built industrial unit on Hamilton Road, Strathaven.
''We rely on customer satisfaction to generate other contracts, so
we're delighted with the increase in business,'' Bob Laverty said.
''Our specialist skills are the key to our expansion -- we've just
completed a total refurbishment contract of a 150-year-old house which
has attracted some complimentary comments from architects and neighbours
because the slated roof and slated dormers blend in so well with
adjoining properties.''

FUNDAMENTALLY, our houses are built to provide shelter from the
elements, and it is the roof of the house which receives most of the
sun, wind, snow and rain.
A roof which is no longer able to remain impervious to wind and water
will eventually prove a major drain on your financial resources -- not
only is the roof itself at risk, but also internal walls, woodwork,
plasterwork and decoration, which can be ruined by prolonged water
seepage. Most repair work should be left to the professionals, but the
homeowner should constantly check for problems, since identifying and
repairing them early will certainly save cash.
Roofing material has to be hard-wearing and durable, and prove
reliable as a protective covering. Many materials in use today have a
long history, like slate, which although heavy and difficult to shape,
is both non-flammable and durable, and lead, which has been used to
cover important buildings like churches since Roman times, and is still
extensively used as a seal on parts of domestic roofs today.
Clay tiles, which were time consuming and expensive to produce when
they were first used in Europe, have been produced relatively quickly
and inexpensively since the seventeenth century, when new and improved
manufacturing techniques were developed similar to those used for
bricks.
Until recently, the style and types of roofing have been largely
dictated by the environment and the materials to hand. Traditionally in
northern Europe, where heavy snow builds up in winter, roofs tend to be
steeply pitched with overhanging eaves. Steeply pitched roofs cost more
to build, because the steeper the pitch, the greater the roof plane
area.
When considering a suitable type of covering for a roof, architects
take many factors into consideration, such as the prevailing weather
conditions, the natural materials available and how the covering blends
in with surrounding buildings.
New technology has resulted in an increasingly wide choice of both
roof styles and materials, and most will last well over 15 years. Modern
concrete tiles and asbestos are popular because they are easy to fix
quickly, but they will not last as long as some traditional materials.
Natural slate is extremely fire resistant, does not absorb and has
been known to last on roofs for over 250 years without any maintenance.
Concrete tiles should last well over 40 years without much maintenance,
and clay tiles and manufactured slate for around 35 years.
It is usually fairly easy to detect signs of wear on roofing materials
provided you are prepared to climb up a ladder and observe safety
precautions. When erecting an extension ladder against your house wall,
get help from a friend or neighbour, who should stand on the bottom
while you make the top secure.
Wear shoes with non-slip soles, never leather soles. Always use two
hands on the ladder, gripping the sides -- not the rungs -- and never
try to carry anything up a ladder in your hands, especially tools. Wear
a belt, and hang tools from it, leaving your hands free for holding the
ladder.
With natural slate or concrete tiles, tap gently with a small hammer.
If they are beginning to rot, they will sound dull and break easily.
Slates will begin to flake as they deteriorate. Manufactured slates will
begin to grow moss and lichen, and although the mosses can be cleaned
off easily, the slates will begin to curl at the edges and become
porous. Clay tiles will show flaking pieces inside the roof, and may
start to crumble.
When inspecting the roof space, use a small knife to test the wood for
rot. If small rotting areas are found, a professional firm will cut them
out and splice new sections on, working from inside the house.
It is an advantage to make the inspection when it is raining, because
you can quickly spot leaks and see where water is seeping through. A
long length of coloured electrical wire, pushed through the hole, will
enable easy identification of the trouble spot from out side.
Another problem to look out for in the roof space is condensation,
which is particularly likely if the roof has been insulated. Frequently
insulation material blocks the air gaps in the roof space. The heat
generated in the house condenses in the roof void, and lies as water on
top of the ceiling.
There are many ways to ventilate roof spaces, and a specialist firm
can fit slates and tiles with vents fixed on, or supply vents which fit
on to fascia boards. If the roof space smells damp and clammy, it is
almost certain that something should be done about providing
ventilation, and the sooner the better.

FIFE Indmar yesterday announced a #1.19m acquisition which will
significantly boost its North Sea hire and sale business, as it unveiled
a 13% increase in final pre-tax profits to #1.02m.
The Edinburgh-based distribution group financed the acquisition of
Aberdeen-based Safety &amp; Technical Lifting Services mainly with debt,
with a small portion of the consideration paid in shares and cash.
However, it plans to raise a net #1.37m through an institutional
placing and one-for-four open offer to other shareholders at 50p,
ensuring that earnings continue to benefit from substantially reduced
gearing.
Fife Indmar's total dividend for the year to end-December is up 9% at
3.0p, after a final payout of 2.25p.
STLS will be merged with Fife Indmar's existing Aberdeen subsidiary,
JACK Scot Equipment Hire.
JACK Scot already hires and sells a range of equipment for North Sea
oil and gas operations above the waterline.
With the addition of STLS, Fife Indmar hopes to reap the benefits of a
predicted upsurge in demand for sub-sea equipment, following the recent
grant by the Government of licences for the development of new fields.
The merged operation will turn over about #3m annually, with STLS
contributing #1.35m in sales.
Chairman Gavin Hepburn, who little more than a year ago repelled a
boardroom takeover attempt orchestrated by former Citylink boss Guido
Crolla, said the merger of STLS and JACK Scot would not have a
significant impact on jobs.
Gearing was reduced from 126% to 69% during the year, reducing
interest charges and boosting pre-tax profits.
The sale of Rochdale-based catering equipment business Henry Nuttall
after the year-end reduces Fife Indmar's involvement in this previously
loss-making activity to virtually nil. This sale, together with the
disposal of a surplus property in Kirkcaldy, will realise more than
#500,000.
Fife Indmar's rise in profits came in spite of a fall in North Sea
earnings back to normal levels, as expected, after exceptional numbers
of hook-ups in the previous two years.
Mr Hepburn expects the good progress achieved by the rest of the group
to continue, in spite of pressure on margins in Fife Indmar's
engineering and hardware distribution operations.
Ironmongery business Glegg &amp; Thomson, whose #780,000 acquisition last
March enlarged the distribution division, performed as expected.
Shares in Fife Indmar closed unchanged at 53p.

The level of rateable value in Scotland is expected to rise by an
average of 30% following revaluation on April 1.
SCOTLAND'S business rate-payers will be paying too much from the
beginning of next month. The uniform business rate of 43.2 pence in the
pound due to be introduced in April is unfair to Scottish businesses,
says rating specialist Bob Mowat of DM Hall. He argues that a fairer
rate would be 35 pence and claims that several factors have been ignored
in calculating the UBR for Scotland.
* The reason for levying rates is to pay for local authority
expenditure. Stated Government policy is that this expenditure should
not rise by more than the level of inflation (ie 3%).
* The level of rateable value in Scotland is expected to rise by an
average of 30% following revaluation on April 1.
* Vacant rates relief and industrial de-rating are no longer available
from April 1.
''Bringing Scotland into line with England -- the UBR in Wales has
been reduced to 39 pence -- might seem to be achieving the level
playing-field which the Scottish business sector has been canvassing for
over the last few years,'' says Bob Mowat.
''Unfortunately, this isn't so. The average rate poundage for Scotland
in the current financial year is 48.5 pence, which could lead people to
believe that the new rate of 43.2 pence will mean significantly lower
bills. Wrong again. A fair business rate for Scotland would have been
the old average 48.5 pence plus inflation, which equals 50 pence.
''From this you would have to deduct 30% -- or 15 pence -- to offset
the anticipated rateable value increases. This means that a fair rate
would be 35 pence. The new UBR of 43.2 pence is 23.4% too high.''
Indeed, if this level of rate had been set, the complex transitional
relief provisions might well have been completely unnecessary.

CABLES and Balfour Beatty construction group BICC increased the total
emoluments of chairman Sir Robin Biggam by #150,803 last year to
#465,137. That includes a pension contribution of almost #81,000.
However, Sir Robin waived another bonus payment of #55,000 which would
have been due under an earnings per share formula. A spokesman said he
had felt that it would not have been appropriate as BICC cut its 1994
dividend total from 19.25p to 14.6p.
There is a bonus payment of #49,950 equivalent to 5.4% of the salary
over the three years of 1992-94 attributable to the 27% increase in the
share price since February 1992 and the average share price over the
year to February 1995.
It could be argued that in comparison with other major companies, Sir
Robin's basic salary of #334,207 is somewhat low as BICC is one of the
most complex of the UK-based international groups.

WHAT a gem Scotland has in the Scottish Ballet. But what a disservice
your critic, Mary Brennan, does to your readers and indeed Scotland
(March 3).
Mary Brennan was presumably present as an apparent expert to comment
on dance, and hopefully to acknowledge where her own opinion differs
from the mainstream. So her column almost persuaded me not to see Swan
Lake and it was only because friends and neighbours told a completely
different story that I decided to see for myself.
Having seen Yurie Shinohara, Campbell McKenzie and the Scottish
Ballet, I cannot believe that we saw the same production and performers.
Galina Samsova's company is something Scotland can take a real pride in
and it is a great pity that is denied us by what can only preconceived
prejudice.
The quality of dance is outstanding, the production stunning, and the
whoops and cheers from a packed theatre a delight to witness.
Interestingly, I also read Mary Brennan's view of The Wizard of Oz
(March 15): ''At the end there were whoops and hollers'', she tells us.
So audience reaction has influence after all.

SAVE &amp; Invest is an unusual shop. Normally it is the shopper who keeps
a look out for the best buys: in this case it is the proprietor and
staff.
Jeffrey Deans and his team of advisers monitor the financial services
market on a daily basis, assessing what is on offer to the shrewd
investor and advising accordingly. That is the big advantage of
approaching an independent adviser as opposed to institutions which
Deans sees as little more than product salesmen.
Save &amp; Invest listens to the objectives of the would-be investor, then
draws up a package. Normally it recommends a balance of cast-iron
investments, such as guaranteed bonds, and stock market-related ones.
Should an investor wish to opt only for guaranteed investments,
however, Save &amp; Invest acts accordingly and offers a choice of what it
judges best from the wide range of products on offer.
Non-taxpayers, for example, might well be interested in a new
Co-operative Bank Fixed Rate Bond, which yields no less than 9.25%
annual income over a three-year period, with all the original capital
returned at the end of it.
But Save &amp; Invest can help with every type of investment and is in
daily touch with the latest rates available on all building society
accounts. There is no need to traipse from one society to another: all
the information is available at the Hope Street shop.
As the financial year draws to a close and a new one approaches, the
focus these days in naturally on PEPs of all kinds and last night (March
21) Jeffrey Deans was speaking at a Herald/Save &amp; Invest Seminar on the
subject, held at Glasgow's Marriott Hotel.
Anyone seeking to open a PEP for the 1994-95 tax year could do much
worse than to seek the independent advice available at Save &amp; Invest. In
the vast majority of cases, action is required before the end of this
month.

Musically, Perth's programme is barely Scottish, but full of delights,
reports Michael Tumelty.
THREE visiting orchestras, two operas, and a resident string quartet
represent the musical highlights of this year's Perth Festival, details
of which were announced yesterday.
For the first time in years, none of the Scottish orchestras will be
present, though all have been running their own joint season in Perth
over the past six months. The Budapest Symphony Orchestra, with its
musical director, Tamas Vasary, will give the opening concert.
They will be followed into the City Hall by the European Chamber
Community Orchestra and the City of London Sinfonia, which will give an
all-Beethoven programme, featuring the Fourth Piano Concerto with
Michael Roll, winner of the first Leeds International Piano Competition.
A more recent prizewinner from the same competition, Japanese pianist
Noriko Ogawa, will give a mammoth piano recital embracing music by
Beethoven, Debussy, Chopin, and Liszt.
Operatically, Perth is stretching its wings this year. Normally, a
single opera, under the direction of John Currie -- who is an artistic
consultant to the festival -- is undertaken. Currie will, in fact, be in
charge of performances of Benjamin Britten's opera, The Burning Fiery
Furnace, in St John's Kirk.
Additionally, this year, Perth Theatre will house a second opera, a
fully-staged version of Sir William Walton's comic opera, The Bear,
which will feature Donald Maxwell and Linda Ormiston.
John Currie will also take charge, with the Perth Festival chorus and
orchestra, of a performance in St John's Kirk of Handel's epic oratorio,
Israel in Egypt.
Central to the musical programme of this year's festival will be a
residency by the Endellion String Quartet. As well as playing in their
own right, and giving workshops and masterclasses, the Endellion will
share a platform with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra Quartet, in which
the joint group will perform Mendelssohn's Octet.
Theatre at this year's festival will feature touring shows by Wildcat
(Bedfellows) and TAG (Liz Lochhead's The Magic Island). Richard Alston,
former artistic director of the Rambert Dance Company, brings his own
group to the Perth Theatre.
The Perth Festival will take place between May 23 and June 4.
* SCOTTISH Opera is to stage an unusual free concert, entitled
Soundbites, that will represent both the announcement of its 1995/96
season and a taster for what is to come, on May 12, at The Shed, the
former Harland and Wolff engine shed in Govan.

IN Britain the gap between the rich and the poor is wider than at any
time since the Second World War, according to a Rowntree Foundation
report.
The British picture reflects a sorry mirror image of the growing
inequalities world-wide. As in Britain, so world-wide the gaps between
rich and poor are widening. At the recent UN Social Summit in Copenhagen
the leaders of rich nations were silent about the root causes of
poverty, and short on concrete proposals for real economic change.
Of course the people with the greatest economic power of all are the
directors of the transnational corporations (TNCs). The turnover of the
largest companies far outstrips that of most nation states. So vast are
these corporations, they can dictate the world trade rules and escape
national laws.
People are made poor by decisions taken by governments, banks, and
companies in rich countries. So unfair are these decisions -- on debt
and trade, on weapons, and aid policies -- that money is actually
passing from the poor countries to the rich.
In 1993, for every #1 given in aid, rich nations took back #3 in debt
payments. The rich countries, including Britain, could make concrete
changes, such as cancelling the poorest countries' debt, or introducing
controls over TNCs. The poor want action not words and they want action
on the causes of poverty.
Growing members of the British public are prepared to take action in
support of their beliefs, whether against new roads or the
transportation of live animals. The challenge before all of us who
believe in a fairer world is to turn that same energy and anger towards
the campaign for justice for the world's poor.

Among the public, the fashion is to despise and disparage the towering
structures of the sixties. But they have their defenders and, as Chris
Holme reports, the top 50 are being recorded as part of the Modern
Movement
MODERN monstrosities or aesthetic delights? As Frank Lloyd Wright
would have said, it all depends on your point of view. Love them or hate
them, Cumbernauld's town centre, Glasgow's Red Road flats, Monktonhall
Colliery and Cruachan Power Station all feature in a new top ten of the
best in modern Scottish architecture.
It has been drawn up by the campaign group Docomomo (Documentation and
Conservation of the Modern Movement) Scotland, for an international
register based at Eindhoven in the Netherlands, featuring the 50 most
outstanding structures from each country.
Docomomo has sent the list to Historic Scotland, but is not demanding
every structure be listed.
English Heritage has taken a more comprehensive and controversial line
than Historic Scotland by recommending listing for 40 modern structures
including the Centrepoint tower and New Zealand House in London.
No-one in their right mind would have suggested that 25 years ago when
they were built. As Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell observed: ''There
is a reasonable level of agreement on the merits of our best Victorian,
Edwardian and inter-war buldings, but no such consensus is yet apparent
for buildings from the post-war period.''
Diane Watters, a committee member of Docomomo Scotland, said its
approach was more pragmatic.
''We do get involved in conservation cases, but our main role is
research and education. We try to be practical about it and understand
the problems associated with use of modern buildings.
''We do welcome the debate. The list of 50 is not just about modern
Scottish architecture. There are good examples there of international
importance.
''Cumbernauld is one of the most interesting megastructures to be
built in post-war Europe,'' said Watters.
So is this some distant high-falutin academic talking? No, she grew up
in Cumbernauld. ''It was an interesting concept but it has had lots of
extensions. I think it has worked OK,'' she added.
Some of the buildings are under immediate threat. St Peter's seminary
at Cardross, which is listed grade A is in a sorry state of repair and
the original Turnhouse airport terminal in Edinburgh, the first major
commission for Sir Robert Matthew, considered the most important
Scottish architect of his generation, seems destined to be cleared for a
new cargo terminal.
Time has run out for others, like Sir Basil Spence's Queen Elizabeth
Square tower blocks in the Gorbals, demolished in a controlled explosion
two years ago.
Leith architect Andrew Merrylees, a former colleague of Spence, was
among many who favoured their retention.
He said architecture, like fashion, represented changing tastes.
''Taste does change. When I was a student, Victorian architecture was
definitely not in favour.
''My own home was built and designed in the 1960s and I have said to
my wife we should hang on to it for another 10 to 15 years because it is
likely it could come back into fashion. It's a question of trends,'' he
said.
Merrylees is also enthusiastic about Mortonhall Crematorium, built in
the style of Spence's Coventry Cathedral, but much better executed.
Desmond Hodges, director of the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland, vigorously defends Glasgow's remaining tower blocks.
''They stand for Glasgow. I would be sorry to see them go. They are of
great historical interest. They represent the period when Glasgow was
going all out to rehouse people,'' he said.
That had its down side. Spence's towers may have been functional and
aesthetically pleasing, but were structurally suspect in the winters of
Northern Europe and ultimately of no use to real people because of a
total lack of community facilities.
Professor Andrew MacMillan, of Glasgow's Mackintosh School of
Architecture, said the same applied to schemes like Easterhouse.
''We all recognise it was a social mistake. I am in favour of
demolishing the whole of Easterhouse and bringing the people back into
the city.''
A wider public debate on the merits of modern buildings is welcomed
both by the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and the Royal
Fine Art Commission for Scotland, whose secretary, Charles Prosser,
said: ''We are alert to this period. It would be terrible if we woke up
one morning and found a couple of decades of our history had been wiped
out compeletely.''
The Docomomo list stops at 1970 just before Scotland's most hideous
eyesore, began its ascent to scar the Edinburgh skyline.
New St Andrews House was so ugly that the Secretary of State and other
Scottish Office ministers moved out. They will soon be followed by civil
servants to a new headquarters in Leith.
''I would think it would be highly unlikely that it would be listed,''
said Graeme Munro, director and chief executive of Historic Scotland.The
body's remit is to look after the 40,000 listed buildings and deals with
2000 applications for changes every year.
Munro said Historic Scotland had already embarked on listing modern
buildings, including 21 churches designed by Jack Coia. Lighthouses,
railway architecture and some hospitals have also provided worthy
examples.
''We have been consulting on thematic listings for a while now, not in
the sense of public advertisements but by consultation with the owners.
There is good and bad from the sixties and seventies. There is potential
to list some modern buildings but we would be highly selective,'' he
added.
Poor quality materials and construction techniques during the 1960s
and 1970s means that some of the eligible buildings will now be reduced
to rubble. That cuts down the list of candidates.
What rises in their place will be for future generations to judge.

<TEXT>
COUNCILLORS in Dumfries and Galloway yesterday accepted a complicated
multi-million pound financial package for the take-over of the Crichton
Royal hospital complex in Dumfries.
The regional council will buy the 27 buildings and extensive grounds
for #3.1m from Dumfries and Galloway Health Board, which has declared
most of them surplus to requirements because of the new care in the
community programme.
The council will also negotiate separately for a golf course and a
commercial artesian well within the grounds, together costing possibly
another #400,000.
As an interim arrangement, the council will then lease the property at
a peppercorn rent to Solway Heritage, a conservation body with
charitable status, and pay them #12.5m to upgrade the site.
At an early stage, the lease will be assigned to a new body -- ''at
arm's length from the council'' -- which will take over the management
and development of the site in order to determine its future use. One
long-term possibility is a university.
Meanwhile, the health board will lease back some of the property at a
guaranteed annual rent of #210,000 for five years.
Council officials have put a ''conservative'' notional value of #20.4m
on the complex and hope to receive borrowing consent of this amount from
the Scottish Office under a Section 94 agreement.
This means that 97% of the loan will be repaid by council tax payers
throughout Scotland and the remainder by those in Dumfries and Galloway.
It will cost the average council taxpayer in the region only #1.83 a
year.
However, councillors were told they had only until March 31 to agree
to take advantage of the window of opportunity, which would not operate
in its present form after that date.
The hospital was founded and endowed as a lunatic asylum in 1834 from
the estate of James Crichton, physician to the governor-general of
India. Its magnificent red-sandstone buildings, in more than 80 acres,
include a large hall, church, administrative buildings, and wards.
The hospital board is retaining ownership of Crichton Hall and a unit
known as the hospice.
The council's chief executive, Mr Ian Smith, said that some of the
land, at a site known as Ladyfield, could be used for housing.
Twenty-nine councillors voted in favour of the complete package and
four for the take-over to exclude the golf course and artesian well.
There were two abstentions.

TRACES of a killer bacterium have been discovered in a town for the
second time in six weeks.
The swimming pool in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, was shut down yesterday
after traces of the legionella bacterium were found in shower heads
during routine testing.
On February 6, the town's showpiece water funpark, the Time Capsule,
was closed after the same bacterium was found in shower heads at the
pool there.
Both times, the legionella was found during routine tests by
environmental health officers.
The council states that the Time Capsule is not involved this time.
Monklands District Council officials say there have been no cases of
Legionnaires' disease discovered yet, but they have urged people who
have used the pool in the last fortnight, and have suffered severe
flu-like symptoms or a chest infection, to contact their GP.
A council spokesman said: ''Maybe we're finding it because we're
looking for it. The facility is closed and will not reopen until it has
been retested and these tests prove negative.
''After consultation with Lanarkshire Health Board, we can confirm
that there are no cases or suspected cases of Legionnaires' disease
known.
''Obviously our prime concern is the safety of people who use our
facilities.''
Usually, those at risk are the elderly or those who suffer ill health.

A PROPOSAL to provide a new #3.3m leisure complex at a Fife holiday
resort is expected to be approved on Thursday.
The swimming pool and associated facilities, for Burntisland and
surrounding communities, is to be funded by the regional council, with
contributions from Kirkcaldy District Council, Fife Enterprise, and the
European regional development fund.
A progress report on the plan will be considered by the region's
policy and resources committee on Thursday but administration leader,
Councillor John MacDougall, said yesterday he was confident the project
would be approved.
Stating that the complex would fulfil a long-term commitment to
replace the town's former outdoor swimming pool, he added: ''I am
confident the policy and resources committee will approve the proposal
as part of the wider Burntisland Initiative, which seeks to provide a
major boost to the economy of Burntisland and surrounding communities.
''The European Commission has approved, in principle, a European
regional development fund grant towards the project, recognising its
important role in the retention and future development of tourism in the
Burntisland area.

EXCLUSIVE
THE legacy of one of Scotland's worst mining disasters has hit a #9m
construction project near Blantyre, Lanarkshire.
All work on new outfall sewers for the Allers Sewerage Treatment Works
has had to be stopped because of the discovery of explosive levels of
methane. Tunnels were being dug close to the site of the 1877 Blantyre
mining disaster, which claimed the lives of 209 miners.
Officials from the Health and Safety Executive in Glasgow were called
in last month after gas in a tunnel ignited, slightly injuring one
workman.
Experts have tried without success for five weeks to clear methane in
one of two underground tunnels. During that time, no construction work
has taken place.
It is understood the methane, which in pockets is above the level
necessary to trigger an explosion, is seeping in faster than it can be
pumped out.
A geological expert from England has been called in by the Health and
Safety Executive, and Strathclyde region has hired a mining consultant
to examine the problem.
A spokesman for the HSE said the organisation was aware of the
proximity of tunnels to the site of the mining disaster and was checking
for a link: ''We have been told that it is a matter of a couple of
hundred yards.
''The problem is that methane gas has layered at the top of one tunnel
and may lie in pockets behind sections of the pipeline already
installed.
''The levels are such that work could not go on just now. Our
investigations are continuing but it is unusual to find this level of
methane during tunnelling operations.''
The spokesman said both tunnels had been capped off and there was no
danger to the public.
The 4.5km-long sewer outfall is designed to divert sewage away from a
local burn and into the Clyde. The work is being carried out to comply
with European freshwater directives.
Mr Tom Harris, spokesman for Strathclyde's water services department,
said steps had been taken by the contractors, Kennedy Construction of
Manchester, to avert any danger from a gas build-up.
''Various precautions were taken in the works, including gas monitors
all along the tunnels. When the incident occurred, work was stopped
immediately and we are in discussions with the HSE about a safe way to
proceed with the work.
''Work will not start again until the safety of the workers can be
guaranteed.''

TWO local authorities on either side of the Border have joined forces
to demand an upgrading of an eight-mile stretch of the A74 between
Carlisle and Gretna.
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council and Cumbria County Council have
agreed on a campaign to lobby the Government in an attempt to secure the
upgrading to motorway status of this section of road, which at present
carries an estimated 37,000 vehicles daily.
Councillor Allan Baldwick, Dumfries and Galloway convener, said the
A74 was of cross-Border importance, being a primary national and
European route which served Scotland, northern England, and Ireland.
He said the Department of Transport saw the gap in the motorway
network ''as a purely Scottish problem'' and, although the Scottish
Office wanted the motorway network to Scotland completed, there was no
commitment forthcoming from the Government.
Councillor Baldwick said: ''As a result of this nonsense, not only are
local communities being inconvenienced by the pressure on an overloaded
and inadequate road but the economic development of three areas --
Northern Ireland, south-west Scotland, and Cumbria -- is being seriously
hampered.
''We agreed to work together to lobby the Government for this scheme
to be completed as a matter of urgency.''
Councillor Anne Glendinning, chairman of Cumbria's economy and
environment committee, said the English local authority had already laid
before MPs and Ministers the argument for improving the road.
She added: ''There can be no doubt that, on both economic and road
safety grounds, this stretch of road should be a priority for transport
departments both north and south of the Border.''
She was hopeful that local authorities in Northern Ireland would join
the campaign to ensure that the eight-mile stretch of road was ''given
the investment it deserves''.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman maintained that the stretch of road
between Gretna and Carlisle was a matter for local authorities south of
the Border.
She pointed out that, following the completion in January of the five
kilometre Cleuchbrae to Dinwoodie Green section of motorway -- at a cost
of #20m -- around 60% of the 128kms of the A74-M74 between Millbank and
Gretna had now been upgraded to motorway standard.

A BORDERS stronghold opens its doors to tourists today, following
completion of a painstaking restoration to bring to life its chequered
career -- from the days of cross-Tweed raids by Scots and English
against each other, to its role as a main commercial inn during the last
century.
In a few weeks, and in time to capture the interest of spring tourists
and other visitors, the Duke of Gloucester is to play a part in the
grand opening of Hawick's Drumlanrig's Tower, which dates from the
sixteenth century. Architects and tradesmen have restored fascinating
features such as gunloops, wall-safes, inscriptions, and the
barrel-vaulted ceilings that form part of the original fortified tower.
Visitors will be transported through the building's various roles,
from its time as a Douglas stronghold, through the period in the
eighteenth century when it was a lavishly furnished residence of Anne,
Duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth, to it becoming a bustling hostelry --
the era into which, Ms Fiona Colton, district museums curator, above,
finds herself transported.
In its new role, Drumlanrig's Tower will also exhibit displays of
hosiery and knitwear manufacturing, a project sponsored by Pringle of
Scotland Ltd.
The Scottish Historic Buildings Trust, the Scottish Tourist Board, and
Roxburgh District Council are among the members of the partnership which
has given the tower new life in an attempt to boost the local tourist
trade.

AN independent report has shown that plans to let the private sector
build, own, and operate water and sewerage schemes would ''fail any
reasonable value for money test''.
The report said that the plans would also impose ''an excessive and
unnecessary burden on ratepayers''.
They could mean costs 44% to 55% higher than under the existing local
authority set-up, according to the private sector Chemical Bank. Its
report was commissioned by Strathclyde Regional Council.
Council leader Robert Gould said yesterday: ''The whole thing is
totally unacceptable. In fact, we would go for a judicial review on
this. Any reasonable person can only come down on our side.''
The report is the latest stage in the region's fierce opposition of
the views of Scottish Secretary Ian Lang on private involvement in
maintenance and regeneration of the water industry.
Councillor Gould derided the private sector interest as being that of
''sharks and gangsters''. He said that any increase in water costs under
the proposed BOO schemes could well be double what they would otherwise
be.
A Scottish Office spokesman said preliminary aspects of the report had
been raised by Strathclyde with the Scottish Office many months ago.
''We take issue with some of the major assumptions in the report and
would see it as fundamentally flawed.
''We would totally reject their assessment of private sector finance.
The use of private funds has a viable role to play in the major
investment programme needed to ensure that there is a high-quality water
and sewerage service in Scotland into the next century. Private capital
will bring taxpayers value for money.''
Councillor Desmond McNulty, who is dealing with reorganisation matters
for the region, said: ''BOO is privatisation by the back door. It will
mean significantly higher water bills for local people.
''It is a stark example of the Government's private sector
initiatives. It is the Government using legislation to force the local
authority to collect secure profits for the private sector.''
The Chemical Bank's report looks at the situation of a sewage
treatment works at Dalmuir, with a capital cost of #100m. Normal
financing through public loan arrangements would be #311m. This would
increase by #138m or 44% under BOO transfer, and by #170m or 55% under
high-risk BOO transfer.
''No amount of improvements in operating efficiencies can offset the
increased capital costs of the BOO schemes,'' says the report. ''On this
basis, BOO schemes fail any reasonable value for money test.''

THE backers of a scheme for Tivoli-style permanent gardens on the
Clydeside site of the 1988 festival yesterday claimed the rival Glasgow
Development Agency proposal will do nothing for local people.
Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 Ltd will hold a public meeting in Govan's
Pearce Institute tomorrow night, in a last-ditch attempt to rally public
support behind its concept.
Mr Sammy Gilmore, former shop steward in the Govan shipyards,
yesterday announced his backing for the garden scheme, which would
include a maritime centre commemorating Glasgow's proud shipbuilding
history.
Mr Mic Starbuck, a spokesman for the company, said yesterday: ''The
people of Govan will be short-changed by the GDA's proposal, which will
see jobs sucked out of the city centre rather than the authentic
creation of new employment.
''Our scheme will give them a genuine chance of employment. And it
would significantly add to the amenity value for them.''
Last night, the agency rejected the company's claims, insisting that
the Pacific Quay development would give Glasgow a ''new dimension to
attract new high value added jobs to the city''

AND so to Birmingham . . . Now there's a phrase that just trips off
the tongue.
One thing we will say is that as a city Brum makes a terrific motorway
service station, but for reasons for which we can find no rational
explanation it remains horribly popular as a conference and meeting
centre.
You know the kind of thing: events at which, if you wait long enough,
all your previous suits will flash before you while massed mobile phones
play a Concerto for Expense Accounts and Management Babble. In
Birmingham, particularly for those fond of driving round in endless
circles in order to view their hotel from all angles save the entrance,
this is what passes for life.
Thus it was that the Diary was to be found on Monday afternoon
somewhere between an airport and a motorway while the UK Press Gazette
handed out its annual awards. The usual affair: honouring talent,
rewarding excellence, and getting right up the noses of all those
colleagues who didn't make the cut.
Accuracy being the corner-stone of excellence in this business, it was
therefore no surprise that when it honoured our own Anvar Khan as
feature writer of the year, the UKPG set us all an example. That's
right: they got her name wrong. Wrong in their magazine, wrong on the
guest list, wrong (and this showed a real eye for detail) on the very
place-settings.
Mind you, this was also the magazine that invited someone called
Stephen Dorrell along as guest speaker and claimed he was a Government
Minister.
Fortunately, they named Anvar correctly on the one thing that
mattered, the award itself. If, however, there's an Enver Cohen out
there, tell him he's too late.
Blending in.
READY to eat all manner of sweet and sour horses and stir fried scabby
dugs on the night before the do, we were escorted to a Chinese
restaurant in Shirley, a suburb of Solihull. Given the predilection of
such establishments for exotic names we might have guessed what to
expect. But no: even this Diary was surprised to be dining most regally
in the Shirley Temple. Still, the duck in plum sauce was better than any
lollipop, or so we're told.
Die laughing.
HAVING long believed that comic relief was what happens when Andy
Cameron's microphone packs up, we couldn't quite grasp what Edinburgh's
Cameo cinema was up to last week while doing its bit for the charity
drive.
True, the big black characters on the marquee were unequivocal: COMEDY
EXTRAVAGANZA they said. Below, however, in slightly smaller type, ran
the words Natural Born Killers. It's the way Oliver Stone tells them,
apparently.
As it turned out, the extravaganza in question involved 24 hours of
''non-stop film fun''. Anyone who believes that Edinburgh folk have no
sense of humour will be comforted to hear that the event kicked off with
that laugh-a-minute masterpiece, Carry On Camping. Those who lasted
until 7am could watch The Jerk, and quite right too.
Bare rate.
WE don't know what it would do for life in your front room, but an
Edinburgh paper is currently running a small advertisement for ''Home
Stripping''.
Big noises.
LIFE in the capital is, as anyone knows, a touch different at the best
of times. Something to do with an innate sense of style, perhaps, which
may be why Edinburgh is hosting the World Mountain Racing Championships
on September 9. What could be more chic than puffing like a train while
turning blue and pedalling up a steep brae simply in order to cycle back
down again?
We're not exactly sure when Arthur's wee Seat, venue for the event,
was promoted to mountain status, but we do hear that the Scottish squad
has put out an appeal for volunteers come the day. Not just any
volunteers you understand, for the squad has a plan, and a devilish one
it is.
To be precise, the search is on for 50 pipers who, it is hoped, will
be stationed at 200-metre intervals around the course, with a view to
blawing our boys up the hill and blowing away the opposition.
Inexplicably, there seems to be no law against it. As the Duke of
Wellington almost said: we don't know what this will do to the enemy,
but it scares most of the hell out of us.
Return to sender.
STILL with Edinburgh, we come to this week's richly deserved Nae Luck
Award.
It goes not to the Scottish rugby team, who have suffered enough, but
to those lucky souls who climbed aboard the special train to London
organised by the Scotsman and InterCity.
On the way down, each of the passengers was handed a badge.
''Scotsman Calcutta Cup Special'', it said. On the return trip,
another badge, obviously prepared in advance, was dispensed to the
mourners: ''I was on the Grand Slam Special''. Edinburgh folk, as is
well known, waste nothing.
Speaking of the Twickenham debacle, we couldn't help but think the
Sunday Times got a little carried away with its front-page coverage. Or
was it just a lack of wit rather than a want of diplomacy that caused
the news desk to assign the task to a certain Tom English?
Lost for words.
WITH elections for the new unitary authorities looming, the parties
are sparing no efforts in their drive to slag off, undermine, and
generally disconcert their opponents. This is the way of democracy as we
know it, and a lot of fun to boot.
Edinburgh's Tories have, for example, put together a newsletter
entitled Blue Print in which our own Brian Meek offers a ''money back
guarantee'' to the voters, which may well be the original offer you
can't refuse. Elsewhere in the paper, however, his colleagues are less
generous.
Thus it is that Councillor Daphne Sleigh, that fine woman, deploys a
fair few words to remind us that the city's Labour administration has
been deeply flawed, wrong-headed, lacking in sense, and of precisely nae
use at all.
To that end she has put together a ''shocking indictment'' of failure,
including the claim that Edinburgh's new conference centre is too small.
Or as the councillor has it: ''The last straw is the latest bombshell''.

IN the fishing dispute our English-speaking cousins in Canada have
accused the Spanish of cheating. With the customary and treacherous
obeisance to the European Union, the British Government declined to
support the Canadians.
Sackfuls of mail received by the Canadian Embassy in London in support
of the Canadians' stand attests yet again to the fact that our
Government's appeasement of Brussels is entirely alien to the sentiments
of the vast majority of the citizns whom it purports to represent.
Between 1989 and 1993, Italy and Spain cheated on their allocated milk
quotas, depriving the Community taxpayers of #3.4 billion in levies. The
Commission imposed a fine upon the cheats whereupon Italy refused to
ratify the EU budget.
Spain refused to ratify the Accession Treaties which would enable
Austria and the Nordic countries to join the EU. The equally corrupt
Commission, under such threats, promptly increased the two cheating
countries' milk quotas retrospectively so that the fines could be
lowered.
Despite understandably furious opposition by British farmers and the
Danes and Dutch to such a shabby and devious surrender to cheats,
Kenneth Clarke, for the British Government, agreed at a finance meeting
in Brussels that the Italians and Spaniards would only pay a fine of
#800m less than the amount they stole.
The Commission's accounting procedures are so lax that no exact figure
of the amount of fraud perpetrated by the European Union countries is
known. It is conservatively estimated that it amounts to #6 billion a
year.
Since the British taxpayers are the second largest net donors to the
Community chest, the continuation of our membership must seriously and
increasingly impoverish this country.
The Italians, Spanish and Greeks to name but three members, must, on
the other hand, imagine that they have found Aladdin's cave.

THE best way to ensure good relations between Britain and America is
to have a Conservative Ministry in London and a Republican
administration in Washington. This is primarily because both parties,
being used to government, accept that it is properly a pragmatic and
limited business. It may have moral goals, but it cannot always reach
them along a straight and narrow moral road.
Imagining that government can be anything better or can do anything
more is the pitfall that awaits other parties when, from time to time,
they get into office. That always ends in tears and, incidentally,
always causes relations between London and Washington to deteriorate.
There are naturally exceptions to the rule. The Republican Eisenhower
did not support the Tory Eden over Suez, but then the plain soldier
recognised a catastrophic mistake in foreign policy that a vain and
double-dealing Prime Minister could not see.
The Conservative Macmillan got on very well with the Democrat Kennedy,
but then he was a splendid old fraud capable of every wile to beguile a
tough young President. He may even have been egged on by the knowledge
that Kennedy came from a notoriously anti-British family, and perhaps
surprised himself that genuine, mutual regard grew out of the stratagem.
Nothing, of course, has compared to the warmth of the relationship
between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Even now it seems a bit
bizarre. He was not obviously her type of man, nor she indeed his type
of woman. But there can be no doubt about the results of their
co-operation, or the importance of their legacy, in bringing about, so
far as politicians can bring these things about, the revival of a
liberal-capitalist order and the death of socialism.
It would anyway have been difficult to prevent a certain cooling once
those two vanished from the scene. But the awful state of relations now,
with deliberate snubs between London and Washington, cannot be viewed so
lightly. Scores are constantly being run up which somebody, on one side
or the other, feels the need to settle.
This unhappy sequence began, it must be conceded, with John Major's
imprudent expression of preference for George Bush during the
presidential election. Bill Clinton has certainly taken revenge
meanwhile.
Unfortunately he is, as a southern Democrat, the worst type of
American politician from the British point of view.
I happened to be in the United States at the time of the election and,
though I did not go to Arkansas, I gazed at it across the wide
Mississippi from Memphis, Tennessee. ''They're as corrupt as hell over
there,'' said my American hosts, a judgment amply borne out since.
Whether or not it could ever have been applied to Clinton in person, as
governor he remained obviously content just to run, rather than clean
up, his state.
To a southern Democrat, wheeler-dealing, jobs for the boys, pork for
the barrel, are in any event the natural ways of conducting politics.
Politics exists for those purposes, and no others. Yet it is dressed up
as tub-thumping morality.
To the rest of us, there may seem nothing moral about it at all. But
to the people running such systems they seem moral, because the ruling
party's supporters have been defined in advance as poor, oppressed,
victimised by history, or otherwise deserving. If the logic still
escapes you, think a little about the way the West of Scotland is run.
Clinton has inherited that morality, and developed it. He called
himself during his presidential campaign a New Democrat, the renewal
having come from the equally hollow morality of the 1960s in which he
spent his formative years. Moreover, he spent some of them in Britain,
and by all accounts did not like what he found.
Perhaps the university of Oxford was hardly the best introduction for
a boy from Arkansas. It houses few of the poor, oppressed, or victims of
history. But it might have imparted to him lessons of greater use for
his career, about the difficulty of importing morality straight into
politics.
That evidently did not interest him. Instead, he has become intent on
deflating British pretensions, above all the one to a special
relationship with America.
The relationship may not always have had moral purposes, though it has
not lacked them at crucial moments in the world's history. But it has
had a supreme pragmatic justification, that Britain and America stand
for many of the same things, and should be allied in defending them.
To spurn all that is further evidence of Clinton's confusion over
politics and morality, the same confusion that loses him congressional
support for potentially popular reforms, or tries to guarantee human
rights to African peoples who have never heard of them.
Luckily, the pragmatic common interest between Britain and America is
likely to survive Clinton, even if there is little chance of its
actually helping to improve relations while he is in the White House.
Assuming he may not be there much longer anyway, perhaps we can then
look forward to a steadier pair of hands.
To someone like Senator Bob Dole, a good quarter-century older than
Clinton, used to exercising power rather than chasing moral chimeras, a
man who remembers the Second World War, who will recall that Britain and
America stand for many of the same things. Quite possibly, however, his
counterpart on this side of the Atlantic will by that time be Tony
Blair, intelligent but fatuous after Clinton's fashion and just as
likely to rile an old-timer.
Indeed, it may be a long time before we again see the happy
coincidence of a Conservative Ministry in London and a Republican
administration in Washington.

YOUR leader, Perth revolution (March 17), demonstrates your
unwillingness to see the SNP as anything other than a one-issue pressure
group that would presumably pack up its bags after independence.
Wrong!
The issues that have top priority for the SNP are jobs, the economy,
housing, health, pensions, and education.
Of course we believe that the best way of creating the kind of
Scotland that we want to see is through a Scottish government. Is it too
much for The Herald to get the message?

Not Socialists
NIC Outterside's report on the launch of Glasgow SNP's manifesto for
the unitary authority elections, while giving an accurate account of
statements made by me may have left some people feeling that I had
described our main opponents in the Labour Party as Socialists (March
16).
The use of the word Socialist to describe Labour candidates was indeed
his description and not one that I would attribute to any Labour
candidate standing for the new unitary authority in Glasgow.
Labour has no ideology left, and the report that I received from one
recently resigned member of the Labour Party that one candidate when
asked at his selection meeting what he thought about Clause 4 didn't
even know what it was highlights Labour's dilemma clearly.

I AM delighted that the Canadians have at last taken on the Spanish.
Small nets, undersize fish, big boats, bigger than anything the
Newfoundlanders have, or Scots, for that matter, devastating traditional
fishing grounds and leaving the native Newfoundlanders being prosecuted
for catching the odd cod to feed their families.
This is what we can expect from the Spanish. Men out of work, women
grovelling for social aid, children undernourished for the principle of
what? Freedom of the seas when we are expected to support cheats and
liars?
Let's get behind Canada on this one. Let's cheer them on before it's

I CAN only agree heartily with your correspondent who condemned the
Secretary of State for his wholly unacceptable response to the Hutchison
Report (March 17).
The Government record on Loch Lomond is an absolute disgrace. Ten
years ago the then Secretary of State set up the Countryside Commission
to examine the issue of how best to protect the lochside's environment.
It reported in 1990 and he immediately shelved the report.
The Hutchison Committee reported two years ago, but Ian Lang delayed
his response. After all this time all that he suggests is that the joint
committee of Loch Lomond Park Authority be superseded by another joint
committee which will then consider the feasibility of having the Loch
Lomond Park Authority and the Trossachs as part of yet another joint
committee.
As he will have gauged from the outraged reaction of everyone
concerned with the future of Loch Lomond, this is an entirely
unsatisfactory and inadequate response to a serious problem.
At the moment Loch Lomond is simply an unregulated pond. Anyone can
travel up the M6 with a boat, launch it on the loch at any point, and
travel at any speed. Last year we had the death of a young woman on the
loch because no regulations were in force. Yet the Government is not
sufficiently moved to do anything about the situation.
What sort of interest has Ian Lang shown in Loch Lomond? He certainly
has shown that he is deaf to the collective voice of the people in the
area.
In the last few months the Secretary of State gave planning permission
for a housing-led development on the shores of the loch which had been
rejected on several occasions by the district council.
Ignoring public opinion and the viewpoint of elected representatives,
the Secretary of State overruled the district council. Subsequently the
developers admitted that they didn't have the finance to carry out their
proposals and went to Dunbartonshire Enterprise with a plea that they
buy them out.
As a result, #3m of public money was used to buy the land in order to
protect the natural beauty of the lochside.
Ian Lang should realise that protecting the environment of Loch Lomond
is a national problem and not a local one because it is enjoyed by
people from throughout Scotland who visit the area. He has totally
abdicated his responsibility to Loch Lomond and the national dimension

WASHINGTON: Iran's ability to threaten shipping in the Gulf is growing

But the Navy's top admiral in the region said privately that US forces

THE response by the Secretary of State to the report of the Loch
Lomond and Trossachs Working Party makes sad reading for all in Scotland
and beyond who have any regard for the protection of this area of
international landscape and wildlife importance and for the best
interests of the local people who are under such great pressure from
visitors and adventitious development (March 14).
Your editorial states: ''The Government believes national parks can
work well in some countries but is unconvinced that they can work in
Britain.'' Setting aside that they have been working for the past 40
years, is this a view of the Westminster Government or the Scottish
Office?
Whatever may be the view of the Scottish Office, the national parks in
England and Wales are making progress and are held in sufficient regard
by the Westminster Government for the current Environment Bill to
contain a proposal to give all the national parks independent boards,
with planning and management powers similar to those enjoyed by the Peak
and the Lakes since the early 1950s.
I am assured by a senior representative of the Lakes board that it is
in no danger of financial ruin, as attributed in the editorial. Indeed,
the annual level of central government finance to the English and Welsh
national parks in recent years has exceeded inflation by a healthy
amount.
The scale of expenditure in the Peak District for the year 1993/4 was
#7.2m gross, a far cry from the #2.85m spread over three years for Loch
Lomond and the Trossachs, an area under as great visitor and development
pressure.
I have had national park experience as director of the Peak National
Park for some 15 years through its early stages of develoment. The area
was already under visitor pressure long before it became a national
park.
In the leisure explosion of the 1950s and 1960s had it not been for
co-ordinated planning and management provision for visitors, undertaken
with limited financial resources, the Peak District today would be a
much less attractive place for visitors and residents alike.
None of this is arguing for importing the English and Welsh model in
toto. However, it bears certain similarities to successful models
adopted elsewhere in Europe. From all of them a solution tailored to
Scottish needs could be developed, given the political will.
As matters stand I find it difficult to go along with Sir Hector
Monro's view that we are going to get something better than national
parks in Scotland. Apart from the fact that the national parks concept
is understood and respected world-wide, the models currently promoted
for the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond fall well below recognised
international standards.
Somehow the Scottish Office must get beyond the ''wha's like us''
syndrome while we still have magnificent countryside left to conserve
for future generations and be prepared to learn from hard-won experience
furth of Scotland.

THE news about the latest developments at BBC Scotland is to be warmly
welcomed (March 16). It is very encouraging, following the announcement
about job losses in the design and costume departments, that the Outside
Broadcast Unit appears to be saved, and Mr John McCormick, Controller,
BBC Scotland, and his colleagues are to be congratulated on the
commitments they have given to maintaining a craft base in Scotland.
However, the ''strategy review of resources'' they intend to carry out
is not enough. If the quality and level of public service broadcasting
that Scotland needs and deserves is to be sustained and developed, what
is needed is a wider review, not limited to resources, but relating also
to policy in Scotland more generally.
This kind of wider review has been called for consistency by the
Broadcasting for Scotland campaign, and was mentioned also by Mr Pat
Chalmers, Mr McCormick's predecessor, in his article (March 16).
There would be value in providing for the possibility of input into
such a review from outwith the BBC, to gain benefit from those groups
and individuals whose interest and experience in this field means they
have much to contribute.
It is to be hoped that the Broadcasting Council for Scotland,
encouraged by this latest news, and recognising that the safeguarding
and pursuing of Scotland's best interests in future discussions within
the wider BBC context in fact demand such a strategy, will pursue this
matter with vigour, and also with great urgency in view of the imminent
completion of the process for the renewal of the BBC's Charter.

Member of the Broadcasting Council for Scotland, 1988-93.

IF an executive demonstrates manifest professional incompetence it is
reasonable to require him to leave his position. If he demonstrates the
morals of an alley cat, should the same apply? The deputy governor of
the Bank of England presumably agrees that this should be so. The
details of an extramarital affair which have been made public have
forced (or so he feels) Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea to resign, thus abandoning
what was felt by many to be a reasonable chance of succeeding the
current governor, Mr Eddie George. In his resignation letter Mr
Pennant-Rea makes an interesting point. He contrasts clearly the
difference in position between figures in the private sector and those
in public life. The danger of disclosure of private behaviour is what
stops many able figures from moving from private to public sectors, he
believes. This assertion is incapable of proof, except in an anecdotal
sense. It would, however, be the greatest misfortune if it were true.
The benefits of bringing successful men and women from the private
sector to the public sector are obvious and include such bonuses as
fresh and innovative thinking and the galvanising effect of change. If
Mr Pennant-Rea is correct, there are numerous private figures who would
not contemplate moving into the public sector, not because of any past
or current behaviour which breaks laws, but because their private lives
contravene morality.
Now, morality is not a thing to be disregarded. Immorality can wreak
the most dreadful damage on families and individuals, but personal
immorality which does not break the law is largely a private affair.
There is one important exception to this rule. When a politician or
other public figure demands greater public morality and then goes on to
behave in an immoral way, that person is guilty of rampant hypocrisy and
deserves to forfeit public trust. Politicians are also elected, and here
again there is a difference between the Pennant-Reas of this world and
the elected representatives, for there is no doubt that election to a
post by the public imposes requirements and restraints whose abandonment
is reprehensible. Mr Pennant-Rea was not elected by the public. As far
as is known he had made no promises to behave in a certain way, nor had
he required others to do so. If any more arguments are needed to prove
the silliness of his resignation, the most important should be the
general understanding that his professional competence was entirely
unaffected by his private behaviour.
Two things follow from this. The first is the feeling that
expectations of behaviour from whole sectors of public figures have
become dangerously skewed from common sense. It is simply not sensible
to lose the services of competent public servants like Mr Pennant-Rea
for reasons which have absolutely nothing to do with the public. Not
only did he do his job well, there is not the slightest evidence that he
took advantage of his position to further his private immorality. The
public case against Mr Pennant-Rea is therefore clear; there is none. It
follows from this that there is a growing need for these simple truths
to be stated with conviction. If this is done, the general acceptance of
the distinctions which we have made should ensure that those who expose
the likes of Mr Pennant-Rea can no longer claim public interest as a
justification. This would make it even less likely that the real
offenders, the hypocrites, thieves, and liars of the public world, are
allowed to hide from proper inquiring zeal.

Manila, Tuesday
A BRITISH mobile telephone salesman today protested his innocence from
a prison cell in the Philippines as he began a 35-year sentence for drug
smuggling.
Nigel Gatward, 31, of Clapham, London, was convicted at a court in
Manila of transporting 11[1/2]lb of heroin.
He escaped the death penalty reintroduced in the country last year,
but said this was of little comfort to an innocent man.
Gatward, who has a common-law wife and two young daughters, is to
appeal against the conviction. The court also fined him #124,000.
Gatward told IRN ''35 years is better than dead . . . what can I do
about it? You ask the embassy what can they do? They can do nothing . .
.
''How can I go inside an airport and put my luggage through an X-ray
examination and it's negative for contraband. Then I am illegaly
arrested and it's X-rayed by the same machine and it shows positive.
It's impossible.''
Gatward's lawyer Fernando Perito said he had already lodged an appeal
although it could take two years.
He criticised both procedures at the trial and the police's handling
of the case, claiming that his client may have been the victim of ''a
bag switch''.
Customs police arrested Gatward last August, taking him from a KLM
flight as it prepared to take off for Amsterdam via Bangkok.
The heroin was found in a bag which Gatward had checked into the
flight, police said.
But Gatward, who was on a business trip, denied the bag was his and
claimed the luggage tag had been tampered with.
A co-defendant, Burmese Aung Win, was jailed for 25 years.--PA.

THE 1996 presidential election is well under way, and it's going to be
fun. Three Republicans have already formally declared their candidacies
and five more plan to do so in the next few weeks. The real business of
tearing each others' eyes out won't get started until the autumn but the
enthralling preliminaries of abusing the Democrats and promising the
moon will keep everyone happy until then.
So far, the 1996 campaign has fit the predictions we all made in 1992.
The Republicans seem all set to slide off to the furthest conservative
extreme, leaving the centre to Bill Clinton. This does not mean that he
is home and dry, but it does put him in a far stronger position than he
deserves.
The Republican candidates, from the right, are Pat Buchanan,
conservative television commentator and loud-mouth, who ran against
George Bush in 1992. He is the nearest thing to an orator in Republican
politics these days. Next, Alan Keyes, who is black and equally extreme.
They would make a fine pair: Mr Buchanan might want Mr Keyes as
vice-presidential candidate, just to prove that he is not a racist.
Then Senator Phil Gramm, who boasts that he was conservative before it
was cool. He is not an orator. On the contrary, he is a bully and a bore
-- but he is very smart, his political and economic views are solidly
thought-out, and he is the favourite of the Reaganite wing of the party.
Then we have Lamar Alexander, former governor of Tennessee, who rather
improbably insists that he is an outsider because he wears a tartan
shirt all the time.
Next, and the current favourite, is Senator Bob Dole. He is the
oldest, and most experienced, which is a drawback. Like Othello, we love
him for the dangers he has passed (he was severely wounded in Italy in
1945), but wonder whether that is really relevant in 1995.
He was the Republican vice-presidential candidate, with President
Ford, in 1976 and ran for the nomination, and lost, in 1980 and 1988.
His main difficulty is that it is not at all clear why he wants to be
President.
Gramm, Buchanan, and Keyes can answer that question at once, and
convincingly. Mr Dole, like George Bush, has a problem with ''the vision
thing''.
Then we have Pete Wilson, governor of California. He has carried that
state, the most populous in the union, in four races, and that gives him
a huge advantage. His problem is that he is not very interesting and can
be overtaken on the right. Senator Gramm is already there, running
against him in the conservative strongholds of the golden state.
There are also two senators, running as moderates: Richard Lugar of
Indiana who is an expert on urban affairs (he is a former mayor of
Indianapolis) and foreign affairs.
Lastly, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who is Jewish, is running as
the pro-choice Republican. No doubt at all, large numbers of
Republicans, probably a majority, support abortion rights in some
fashion and oppose the inflexible anti-abortion position of the Pat
Buchanans. It is not very probable that enough of them care so much that
they will support Mr Specter against the strong tide of extremism that
is rushing through the party.
Notice that the Rev Pat Robertson is not on the list. He ran in 1988
and was soundly beaten. This time, he prefers the role of eminence
grise. The Christian Coalition that he founded is very influential, and
will devote itself to supporting extreme conservative positions.
Its director said the other day that the Coalition will oppose any
Republican candidate, for President or Vice-President, who does not take
a dogmatic pro-life position. There are lots of born-again Christians
who follow Pat Robertson, and they all vote.
The eight avowed or soon to be avowed candidates will devote the next
six or nine months to raising money. The first primary, in New
Hampshire, is on February 20, New York on March 7, Texas and most of the
South on the 12th and California on the 26th. And then it will be over.
So the candidates must have the resources to campaign flat out for two
months over half the country -- and the conventional wisdom is that they
need at least $20m to do so.
Which is why we are off to such an early start. It takes time to raise
that amount (that's $55,000 a day for those starting now), and they must
all scramble to be in the news while begging for money.
That means being as provocative as possible, which helps Mr Gramm, and
Mr Buchanan, but hurts Senator Dole, who has to prove his control of the
Senate, which means compromising with the Democrats and his own
moderates.
As for Bill Clinton, it's all good news, so far.

A STUDENT is summoned by one of her lecturers to account for her
repeated absence from tutorials. The student confesses to having a job
serving in a cafe on the same day as the tutorial. She explains that she
needs the work to make ends meet. Her lecturer understands about student
hardship and knows that confronting the problem with a threat will
merely drive it underground -- or back behind the counter -- and
increase drop-out rates. But she worries that this student's story is
the tip of an expanding debt mountain. She is right, and it is
threatening to engulf the very purpose of higher education, as the
latest data on student hardship shows. A survey by the National Union of
Students and National Westminster Bank of nearly 2000 students in
Liverpool and Birmingham has found that hardship has reached record
levels, with increasing numbers in debt and one in three saying they
have at times to go without food. More than two-thirds face financial
crisis, hardship is harming the academic work of more than one-half of
students, and one-third have taken term-time work to supplement grants
and loans.
This is not what higher education is about. Students go to university
to study, develop their personalities, broaden their experiences, secure
a qualification that will lead to a fulfilling job and, yes, have a good
time. Even accountancy and business studies undergraduates do not enrol
to be consumed by money worries. Febrile number-crunching has its place
in the lecture theatre, the library, the exam hall -- not the bedsit,
the hall of residence, the family home. Yet the books are balancing for
fewer and fewer students. Plunging into the red, however, is not just
their concern. Higher education has a cost. No-one should be hidden from
it, and we should all be prepared to contribute. The Government's policy
is to shift the burden of the cost of student maintenance from the
taxpayer to the putative beneficiary of higher education -- the student.
Students are no longer eligible for income support, or unemployment and
housing benefit. By next year the value of grants and loans will be the
same. Public expenditure on student maintenance will be reduced, as will
parental contributions -- in theory at least. That qualification is
necessary because students are borrowing more from their parents -- as
well as from banks, building societies, and the Student Loans Company.
And so the debt mountain grows. Students graduating four years from
now after a typical Scottish honours degree will do so with debt of more
than #7000 under the present loans scheme. That sum takes no account of
parental support or other debt run up by students. And the current
method and timescale for repaying student loans means that graduates
must sustain a disproportionate burden early in their working lives as
they meet the demands of the Government's debt collection agency. When
it established the scheme one of the aims was to increase students'
economic awareness and self-reliance. For economic awareness read
immersion in the culture of debt; for self-reliance, the donning of
aprons, the serving of burgers with a smile, the playing of a piano in
shopping malls. When it comes to paying bills and being self-reliant,
tutorials take second place. If this is self-reliance it is a bankrupt
model.

THE Tory Party has not been fortunate with its recent party chairmen.
Cecil Parkinson was the last unambiguous success in the post and only
then because he spent most of his time sucking up to his leaderine.
Even a political boot boy like Tebbit needed his leather jacket to
protect him from friendly flak in his spell before the mast, while
Kenneth Baker's reward for oiling the Tory machine was to be memorably
portrayed as a snail on Spitting Image.
John Selwyn Gummer's performance needs no elaboration beyond the
mention of his name but even he looks like a political giant compared
with the present incumbent. Jeremy Hanley is finding some difficulty
getting into his stride.
This must have something to do with the job, although we must not
underrate Hanley's own individual talent for making a mess of things.
The Tory chair is certainly a lightning conductor for the rest of the
Government. In this administration that is a substantial task. He will
inevitably get fielded to defend the indefensible and to explain the
inexplicable.
The job is basically one of political fire fighting with the
occasional opportunity to launch a strike at the opponent's goal.
Unfortunately Hanley tends to approach the first part of the job with a
bucket of kerosene rather than water while the only crosses he has
converted thus far have been in his own penalty area.
He has now reached the unenviable position that everybody assumes he
is about to make a gaffe and so he inevitably does. His latest problem
was his failure to back-up his charge of ''corruption'' directed at
Labour councils.
Corruption can, of course, manifest itself in a variety of forms, from
the malign to the ridiculous. A few years back I was chatting to a local
councillor who had defected from the SNP to the ruling independent group
in one of Scotland's rural councils.
He told me with a smile that he realised he had been fully accepted
into his new political home when bags of tatties began mysteriously to
appear on his doorstep. His response was to retire from local politics.
Individual councillors are occasionally caught with their hands in the
cookie jar. Mr Hanley may not be aware that even among the less than
serried ranks of Scotland's Tories a prominent councillor has been
spending some time at her Majesty's pleasure.
The same is true of the Labour Party. The fact is that all political
parties, including the SNP and the Liberals, will have the occasional
rotten apple in the barrel. That is human rather than political nature.
This hardly provides justification, however, for attempting to brand an
entire political party as corrupt.
There is also a difference between behaviour that is simply
reprehensible and that which is corrupt. The West Lothian Labour
councillor who resigned yesterday after claiming #17,000 expenses for
commuting from his home in South Shields may have been legally entitled
to his money. The electorate is still unlikely to commend him or his
party for their behaviour.
Then there is the behaviour of entire councils, and here Jeremy's feet
are planted on yet more uncertain ground. Speaking from Westminster, the
haunt of Lady Porter, seems hardly the place to adopt a holier-than-thou
attitude to the activities of Birmingham City Council or even Monklands
district.
The rich vein that past Tory chairmen could mine about ''loonie left''
councils is starting to run out. It is some time since Labour in
Scotland could boast a left-wing council, loonie or otherwise, while
even in London the new wave of Blairist moderation is sweeping through
the town halls.
And yet if the hapless Hanley had bothered to commission some decent
research rather than relying on the ''rotten boroughs'' column in
Private Eye he could have found some substantial charges to level at the
unacceptable face of local Labour politics.
In Scotland the general problem is not too much corruption but too
little democracy; not crackpot councils but tinpot councillors.
Across Scotland Labour administrations jealously hold the reins of
power, packing committees and outside delegations with their chosen
nominees.
In East Kilbride they exclude opposition councillors from the six
major council committees including, with a fine touch of irony, the
equal opportunities committee!
In Inverclyde they have a narrow majority on the council but gobble up
82% of the appointments to outside bodies.
In Dundee Labour has effectively quangoed the administration by taking
decisions concerning the three largest committees behind closed doors
and involving only two Labour councillors and officials. At the district
election Labour secured 36% of the vote in the city but hold almost 90%
of the appointments to outside bodies.
These are not isolated examples but a general malaise afflicting local
Labour. The same arrogance which Labour rightly detects in the
administration of central government is there for all to see in its
stewardship of local government.
Just as the Tories have been in power too long at Westminster so
Labour has been in office too long in the town halls. Scottish democracy
could make a fresh start by the removal of both.

ANOTHER spectacularly unsuccessful night on the tiles and I'm back
home in single solitude, whiling away the small hours with my customary
cup of Ovaltine and The Chart Show. Oh no, Saint Kurt of the Cobain
preserve us, but they've swooped into the Video Vault and resurrected an
early Wet Wet Wet single -- Marti Pellow in pre-flowing locks
incarnation and, hard as it is to credit, looking even smugger than he
does now, simpering on about Sweet Little Lies.
Flinch from screen and delve into copy of Hello! magazine to keep up
to scratch on what well-dressed minor celebs are wearing to their
weddings these days. Thankfully, Sweet Little Lies is soon locked
securely into the Video Vault again and song changes into even more
stomach-churning sacharine, with a quintet of homeboys crooning Show A
Little Love. Sounds suspiciously cherubic.
Glance up and watch cute little boy addressing the camera, face
pinched in pain as if he's just went one lollipop too far; ''Mama always
said I'd fall in love someday, but I didn't know it would hurt like
this.''
Wonder what his mama is doing letting him out of the house on his own.
''Show a little love and understanding,'' he entreats, as a Naomi
Campbell lookalike writhes around. She is adult-sized (very) but he
doesn't look old enough to have made double figures, let alone make a
pass. He knows better, pouting heroically: ''I'm trembling from the
thought of being all alone, touching, holding, needing, wanting, I'm
longing for your love.''
His wee pals join in the chorus, ''All the joy I'm giving girl, I can
tell you're not responding/Is it because I'm too demanding?'' It's a
typical whining love song which builds to a breathy crescendo: ''I want
to know what turns you on.''
Sit there aghast, feeling more than a little uncomfortable at the idea
of a little boy wanting to know what turns me on. This is Ultimate Kaos,
the latest British (despite references to Mamas, the hood, and other
Americanisms) group to be marketed at the lucrative teeny-bopper market.
They supported Take That on their national tour last summer and
cracked the charts then with the single Some Girls, which knowingly
listed what babes were into -- hey, some like their necks stroked, some
don't. The teen group are actually aged between 12 and 17, although
12-year-old Haden, who leads on Show A Little Love, looks much younger,
as does 12-year-old Ryan, son of Maxi Priest, who solo'ed on their last
single, the saucy Hoochie Booty.
Feel curious and very unfamiliar compulsion to become guardian of
moral standards and start fretting that these little lads are so keen to
grow up so fast. Worry that they're worrying about the pangs of lurve
and wish they'd stay at home and do something more suitably childlike,
like play with their Gameboys or torture the cat, or whatever it is
young folks do nowadays. Resent the little gits for making me feel
uptight, upright, and old.
Phone their record company at a more suitable hour and berate their
publicist with accusations of exploitation which she cheerily denies,
assuring me that the boys have lots of fun and when they get together
''it's like playtime''.
Snarl about suggestiveness of lyrics and she sighs pityingly down the
phone, obviously assuming she is talking to the heir apparent of Mary
Whitehouse. ''That's such a British attitude, they're only singing about
the typical preoccupations of their age group,'' she sneers in a more
liberal-than-thou way, adding: ''They wouldn't make this fuss in
France.''
Well, non, but excusez moi if I refuse to be influenced by the nation
who smiled indulgently on Serge Gainsborough and his then-teenage
daughter Charlotte's musical collaboration, the blatantly titled Lemon
Incest, and whose biggest popstar of recent years was a three-year-old
tot.
Mind you, I muse on the history of suggestive lyrics in pubescent pop
and realise Ultimate Kaos are merely following a long and dishonourable
line. After all, there was young Michael Jackson pleading I Want You
Back on the Jackson Five's first hit, and ''Young Jimmy Osmond''
offering I'll Be Your Long-Haired Lover from Liverpool.
Somewhat miraculously, considering the milk-toothed muso's plumpness,
preponderance of freckles, and tasteless tank-top, thousands of young
girls took him up on the offer and catapulted him to number one. Then
there was Musical Youth cheerily chanting Pass the Dutchie, which had
dopeheads across the country sniggering over their ganga at the hashpipe
reference, while another young British group had a success with the
innuendo-laden Candy Girl.
Not forgetting our very own Lolita from Rothesay, Lena Zavaroni, who
triumphed on New Faces with Mama, He's Making Eyes At Me, disturbingly
singing about stirring carnal desires while wearing a little-girl frilly
frock and ankle socks.
And that paedophile dream was tame by comparison with the taste
nightmare which was the cult early eighties Channel 4 show Minipops,
which mysteriously withstood weeks of outrage and complaints to show
young boys and girls, some only toddlers, dressed in adult clothes and
make up, miming along to contemporary pop hits, such as Madonna's Like A
Virgin.
Another memory; me, standing on a chair at a party bawling out Stand
By Your Man. I think I was five. Maybe Ultimate Kaos aren't such an
indictment of our warped times after all. I guess girls'n' boys were
always more intrigued by the birds and the bees than by ice cream and
toys.

Hamburg, Tuesday
FORMER world number one tennis player Monica Seles told a German court
today that a suspended sentence imposed on a man who stabbed her two
years ago was too lenient . . . he did not kill her ''but he destroyed
my life''.
The attacker looked at the long knife he used to stab her and said
murder was not on his mind in the attack that effectively ended her
tennis career.
Seles, 21, has not played a tournament since Guenter Parche, a
40-year-old lathe operator from eastern Germany, stabbed her in the back
with a kitchen knife at the Hamburg Open in April 1993.
Parche said he had acted out of love for Seles's German rival Steffi
Graf.
Hamburg's public prosecutor and Yugoslav-born Seles are appealing
against the suspended two-year sentence imposed on Parche for grievous
bodily harm.
The appeal hearing is expected to last several days. Miss Seles is not
expected to appear but wrote to the court.
Parche, at the start of his retrial, said if Seles had been a German
or an American, he would not have thrust the kitchen knife into her back
as she sat on a bench during the tournament in Hamburg.
But Parche later said he would have attacked Seles even had she been a
naturalised US citizen, which she became some time after the stabbing.
The court was trying to determine whether there was anti-Serb
prejudice.
Parche got a two-year suspended sentence during his first trial in
October 1993. Seles and many other tennis stars were enraged.
Presiding judge Gertraut Goering received piles of hate mail, some
from the United States, including one letter saying she should be
beheaded.
In a letter read by her lawyer today, Seles said she had worked hard
and sacrificed all her life to become the best in tennis.

TERRY HOUSTON visits Albion and finds management has been put in its
place -- on the shop floor
IN the traditionally autocratic world of heavy engineering, Scotland's
most historic automotive company is pioneering new working practices . .
. the introduction of devolution to the shop floor.
Albion Automotive, of Glasgow, Britain's best-known manufacturer and
designer of axles, chassis components and crankshafts, has stepped away
from the old-style system of running the plant from ''the office
upstairs''.
At their South Street factory, on the Clydeside, they have moved their
complete production management team, lock, stock and barrel, into
offices in the very heart of the plant.
They now operate from glass-sided offices on the factory floor, in
full view of the workforce, who have instant access to them to discuss
problems arising from jobs.
The open-plan offices -- known as business units -- house everyone
from the general manager, through his two unit managers and quality,
logistics, material, and maintenance engineers, to facilitators
(foremen).
The two units have been designed deliberately to ensure maximum,
open-door management . . . getting away from the old ethos of a factory
run by faceless department heads in ''white collar'' offices remote from
the production floor.
The creation of the business units has created a two-way street, where
management staff have easy access to each other and to workers, and the
workforce can go direct to any member of the management team with
specific queries.
The results have been cut-down bureaucracy and paperwork; improved
communications; dramatically cut waiting times on problem solving;
removal of many of the ''them upstairs'' barriers; and the opening up of
new opportunities to create greater dialogue between management staff
and the shop floor on improving working practices.
The general manager, Ian Reid, 47, from Paisley, who has complete
responsibility for factory floor operations, and has worked with the
engineering firm for 30 years, is enthusiastic about the quiet
revolution in working practices.
He said: ''Previously, everything was department-orientated. But the
focus wasn't there. Within departments, often there were different
priorities. Now that people are on the shop floor, they are no longer
invisible people -- there's no more talk about 'them upstairs'.
''There is much more communication. Guys can walk straight through our
door to talk about something. The glass windows are important, too.
There's no secrecy, no mystique about management work.
''If managers can watch shop floor at work, why can't workers watch
management at work? Actually, everyone's busy getting on with their own
jobs. But what the shop floor business unit has done is give everyone a
wider knowledge of the way the plant works.
''You appreciate more what's involved in other people's jobs. We still
have tight targets but it is more democratic.
''Going into receivershp was a traumatic experience. We're very
conscious we are not a multi-national. No-one is going to bail us out.
There's a realisation that there is no hiding place -- successful
business depends on everyone.
''Under this system, productivity is improving and, for certain, we
are much faster at problem-solving. We also have greater flexibility and
adaptability.''
As part of the devolution process, the Albion plant is divided
geographically into two sections, run by the company's two Business Unit
Managers, who report to Ian. They have semi-autonomous control of
everything which happens in their sectors.
One of them, Brian Lang, 42, of Scotstoun, Glasgow, who has been with
Albion for 26 years, said: ''I have always felt comfortable about
getting information from operators. But this system is much better.
People on the shop floor, under the old system, were very reluctant to
leave it and go to upstairs offices.
''It was a different environment, unfamiliar and probably a little
intimidating for them. They didn't feel comfortable about going
upstairs. So a lot of talking didn't get done.''
He added: ''With the business units here, the amount of paperwork has
been cut back. One of the spin-offs is that the factory is probably
cleaner. That's part of the works culture now -- performance, quality
and cleanliness.''
Facilitator Raymond McRobbie, 43, from Denny, Stirlingshire, who has
been with the company for 23 years, admits he was uncomfortable at first
with the new system.
''For the first four weeks, I was struggling,'' he confessed. ''I
didn't like it. I'd been used to doing my job completely on my own. Then
I came to realise that having the rest of the managers here was an
advantage -- I didn't have to spend nearly so much time chasing after
people. They were all here.
''I got through the work a great deal faster because I could just walk
over to people and talk to them.
''There has actually been a change in attitudes. There is much more
openness. Information is shared. I hold a weekly meeting with the shop
floor to discuss work matters. And if I didn't, they would very quickly
be asking for them.
''Because we share information, we're able to set up jobs better and
more efficiently. Tasks are getting done in an order that often can suit
both the operator and the deadline requirements. If it can't, then at
least the operator knows the reasons. Before, he would never be told.''
Operators like the ''goldfish bowls'', as they have nick-named the two
business units.
Machineman Louis Ford, 50, from East Kilbride, who has been at the
plant for 22 years, said: ''This unit is a big improvement. Sometimes,
you could wait two or three weeks to get action on a query. Now you can
grab people right off.
''Also, they get an insight into our work. They're not just office
wallahs who have no idea what we do.''
Toolmaker George Young, 56, of Rutherglen, who has been at the plant
for 41 years, said: ''The old system was them and us. But now people
have to justify what they say and do. You can get a grip of, say, a guy
who did the drawing, and query it.
''In the old system, the job might just be stopped -- or you would be
told to go ahead and do it, even though you had a fair idea it wasn't
right. Then it would be scrapped, anyway. Things are more enlightened
now.''
Grinder Bob Edward, 61, of Dumbarton, who has been with the firm 34
years, said: ''The whole attitude of the workforce has had to change.
Now it's eyeball to eyeball -- you can't hide.
''There's no wandering about looking for faceless folk in offices you
couldn't find. That was stupid. It's a lot harder now for people who are
still reluctant to come out to deal with your problem.''
Computerised turner Harry Thomson, 47, of Clydebank, who has been with
the company for 18 years, said: ''I was one of the biggest cynics. I
reckoned it was up to me just to do my job and that was all. But times
have changed -- we've all got to help solve our problems. You've got to
get involved.
''It's made my job easier. Things which could take hours to deal with
before are often solved in minutes.''
Driller Scott MacGregor, 25, of Ibrox, who has been with the company
for 10 years, has just started a new post as quality audit inspector.
He said: ''We're all more aware. Scrap levels have dropped
dramatically. There's more time spent on the machine because we've cut
down wasted time. I think we have a better future now.''
Machine setter and operator Harry McCulloch, 50, of Clydebank, who has
been with Albion for 21 years, said: ''I think the new system has had a
tremendous effect -- even in getting in components. To get them you just
go to the order guy and tell him what's needed and he lifts the phone
there and then.
''You have it within days instead of three or four weeks. Responses
are a lot faster. I think, too, management have a different outlook.''

Khayelitsha, South Africa, Tuesday
THE Queen moved from pomp to poverty today, visiting two sprawling
dirt-poor black townships on the second day of her state tour of South
Africa.
But she had to cut short her visit to Langa township by a few minutes
when friendly but over-enthusiastic spectators at a sports ground
swamped the royal party and police bundled her away for safety.
The sea of tiny tin-and-wood shacks lacking water and toilets in the
townships on Cape Town's outskirts was in sharp contrast to the
formality and pomp of her arrival yesterday for the six-day visit with
the Duke of Edinburgh.
Earlier today, they attended a moving Anglican service of
''thanksgiving and reconciliation'' in St George's Cathedral on South
Africa's first Human Rights Day, commemorating the 1960 Sharpeville
massacre that turned the country into an international pariah.
Apartheid's security forces shot down 69 black protesters in the
Sharpeville township south of Johannesburg during a demonstration
against the hated pass laws that restricted black movement in the
country.
Security forces also gunned down 18 people on the same day protesting
against the pass laws in Langa, Cape Town's oldest township with about
40,000 people.
''What happened 35 years ago in Sharpeville eventually led to South
Africa leaving the Commonwealth (in 1961), because from then on she
became the pariah of the world,'' Archbishop Desmond Tutu told the
packed cathedral congregation which included Presidsent Nelson Mandela.
He praised God for the dramatic switch from apartheid to democracy,
which culminated in last year's all-race elections that ended white
minority rule and brought Mandela to power.
At Langa, the Queen met Sports Minister Steve Tshwete and other
officials. But she was swamped by hundreds of enthusiastic spectators
after watching multi-racial cricket practices among 10-year-olds and
police had to form a human chain around the party.
Heavy police security was in force for her visits to Langa and at
Khayelitsha, a sprawling squatter camp of some 700,000 people.
At Khayelitsha, the Queen visited the British-aided Philani (Be Alive)
centre where malnourished children are helped, and nutrition training is
given. It also has a weaving centre.
Philani is a bright dab of buildings painted yellow, green and purple
amid the drab shacks erected on wind-swept sand dunes. The Queen planted
a wild fig tree on the centre's lawn.
Crowds were moderate compared to the city centre. About 2000 lined the
dirt roads held back by orange plastic barriers in Khayelitsha, and many
were unsure who they had come to see on a national holiday -- or even
who the Queen was.
''The government is very far away from us, but with the media coming
to see the Queen here, maybe the government will know we're here and we
can have water and toilets,'' said Rogers Stayimeli.
The Queen also took a trip down memory lane, visiting Cape Town's old
City Hall where she celebrated her 21st birthday in 1947 with a
glittering ball.
She smiled happily as she looked around the high-ceilinged main hall
and pointed out different aspects of the chamber to the background
strains of the city's symphony orchestra.
She and Duke waved to a cheering, ululating crowd from the City Hall
balcony, where President Mandela first appeared following his release in
February 1990 from 27 years in prison for his struggle against
apartheid.
The Queen has emphasised during her state tour that she had warm
memories of her previous South African visit.
The trip has set the seal on relations between South Africa and
Britain and the Commonwealth.--Reuter.

One of the biggest social changes of recent years has been the growing
casualisation of the labour market. Margaret Vaughan meets one young
victim and looks at the wider implications.
DAVID is 23 and an accountancy graduate. He has a job. He does not,
however, have a home of his own because he can't get a mortgage. He has
no car because he can't get a bank loan. He can't marry Marie, his
fiancee, because he has no security to offer.
David is a member of the new, casualised workforce. The flexible
friend of the labour market. His job in Livingston is part-time, on a
temporary contract which has been renewed three times in the past 18
months.
''It's like living in a kind of limbo. I count myself lucky to have
work but, although I get a wage, that's about it. The benefits you
somehow expected to come with a job aren't there.
''Somehow, the sense of social exclusion I felt when I couldn't get a
job after college is still there. I'm still living with my parents.
There's no sense of building a life, a career, even, because there isn't
one on offer.
''There's no feeling of commitment on either side, because to the
company I'm just a number-cruncher. There's a sort of mutual
disinterest.''
Yesterday's disclosure that all the new jobs created in Scotland
between March and September last year were part-time is a trend that
comes as little surprise to Professor Laurie Hunter. It worries him,
though.
''If we don't get a period of sustained economic recovery, employers
will not feel confident enough to convert more of their marginal jobs
into core jobs.
''If they don't get that, don't develop that confidence, they will
continue to play it cautious and that may be their death-knell. If they
continue to play at the cheap end, they won't get the commitment and
loyalty of their workforce to enable them to compete in the markets.
That means they will lose out.''
The Glasgow University economics professor is careful to draw a
distinction between part-time jobs which are permanent and those which
are temporary, a feature of the changes in the labour market.
The evidence, he says, shows that a high percentage of the people in
part-time jobs live in households in which there is already someone else
at work
''If you go to the low-income households, you don't find a high
percentage in part-time work. What seems to be happening is a wider
spread of the poverty gap; it's being exaggerated. It's not as if the
households with low incomes are getting much of a toehold through
part-time jobs. They don't even seem to get that.''
Short-term contracts create a problem with security. Often, Professor
Hunter says, he has researchers working on two or three projects who
want to buy a house. ''I have to try to work out whether their prospects
are assured or not.''
The long-term trend, which has been exaggerated by the recession, is
that the vast majority of new jobs will be part-time, while full-time
jobs are disappearing, particularly full-time jobs for males.
''What it means is that, if you add together all the part-time jobs,
the temporary jobs, and a lot of new jobs in the form of self-employment
and sub-contracting, you are now looking at what you might call a
non-standard labour force.''
Something closely approaching 40% of all those in employment now work
in a shifting, unsecured jobs market. ''You only have marginally over
60% of people in regular standard employment.''
That is a massive social shift. ''You also have the change in people's
sense of security. That's not to say that a lot of people are much more
at risk, but everybody feels themselves much more at risk.'' Hence the
feel-bad factor.
Those who joined big companies, in expectation of security, of working
towards retiremement at 65, now increasingly find themselves counted out
from 55 upwards. In the drive for organisational efficiency and
cost-cutting, layers of management have been removed and restructured.
''This means there is an increasing number of jobs at the top end of
the market and at the bottom end of the market but there is a growing
gap in the middle.''
A lot of middle-income jobs are simply disappearing. ''One worry in
social terms is what happens if that continues. At the bottom end, you
have a lot of poor quality jobs, low-skilled, with no prospect of career
development. At the top end are people doing nicely. But in the middle,
the craftsmen, supervisors, foremen, production workers, are squeezed
out.
''That may suggest an increasing split in the labour market, with no
way to work your way up. It begins to worry me as an economist and you
can see the signs of it in terms of income and earnings inequality,''
says Professor Hunter.
A sustained period of recovery over a three or four-year period may be
enough to help the labour market begin to draw people in. ''If we have a
problem in sustaining that kind of growth, there are bigger risks about
the bigger social and economic divide between the haves and have-nots.
The next couple of years might be quite critical in that respect.''
But in order to be competitive, employers have to understand that they
cannot rely on offering relatively low quality work to people who don't
have any real attachment or involvement with the company, Professor
Hunter claims. ''Particularly with people on short-term contracts, there
is no commitment, no loyalty.''
To be competitive and efficient, companies need to invest in a
workforce. ''It worries me that a lot of the things happening at the
moment show that companies don't seem to understand that. They are
creating dead-end jobs where the workers have a marginal attachment.''

Bujumbura, Tuesday
GRENADE explosions rocked the Burundi capital of Bujumbura today, 30
minutes after the night curfew deadline in the city which was being
patrolled by hundreds of soldiers.
Witnesses said three grenades exploded in quick succession in the
mixed suburb of Buyza where eight members of the Tutsi minority were
killed and 13 wounded last night.
The chatter of small arms fire appeared to confirm the fears of city
residents that Tutsis would seek their revenge on the Hutu majority.
''It will be hell in Buyza tonight,'' one resident, who would not be
named, told Reuters shortly before the curfew.
''Although no arrests have been made, people know who was responsible
and tonight is for revenge.''
The violence followed a day in which the security force presence was
strengthened and government ministers appealed for calm and cooperation.
Diplomats said they feared Hutu gunmen, who killed three Belgians and
at least two off-duty Burundian soldiers in an ambush on Sunday,
intentionally picked out white expatriates for the first time in an
attempt to heighten the ethnic crisis.
A funeral mass for the Belgians, a man, a woman and her four-year-old
daughter, will be held in Bujumbura tomorrow.
The gunmen ambushed a minibus carrying off-duty soldiers on a road
southeast of the capital but also turned on cars carrying the Belgian
expatriates to Bujumbura from a sports event.
Three Belgians and three Burundian soldiers were wounded.
A police officer said 17 people, including the Belgians, were killed
in the ambush at Nyamutenderi, seven miles southeast of Bujumbura but
the official death toll was five.--Reuter.

Allan Laing's first view of comic Robbie Coltrane could have been just
a touch off-putting, but he stayed the course along with some Glasgow
drama students, and heard serious discussion about being funny.
ROBBIE Coltrane attributes the remark to Stanley Baxter: ''Comedy,''
he says, ''is like a crowd watching a man on a tightrope. On the one
side is good taste; the kind of things you're allowed to say. On the
other side you get bad taste; what social convention dictates it is not
permissible to say''. Then Coltrane pauses, momentarily, for theatrical
effect. ''And in Glasgow,'' he adds, ''they hope the rope breaks.''
The crack raises a laugh in the audience. This is good. This is very
good, in fact. Indeed, it's only fitting because Coltrane is delivering
a short lecture on humour -- on the business of being funny -- to drama
students at Andy Byatt's legendary actors' studio in Glasgow.
And Robbie Coltrane is a very funny man. Even when he's not acting.
Like when he's taking his lunch break and you are led into a wee room to
talk to him. And the first sight you get of Robbie Coltrane, actor,
writer, comedian, is his not inconsiderable (and mercifully trousered)
arse. For he is doing what Glasgow wifies have done since they invented
tenements. He is hanging out the window watching the world go by.
Eventually, he comes back in and almost smiles at you when he shakes
your hand. You have to remember that here is a man who does not have a
particularly high regard for newspapers. I mean, he's no Billy Connolly
but he is suspicious of journalists.
There is nothing wrong with this, you reason, for he doesn't know you
from Adam and he has suffered in the past from twisted press reports.
Indeed, you would think the less of him were he hail-fellow, well-met.
For that would be disingenuous. His demeanour is simply what you would
expect. Courteous and polite and yet wary and slightly distant. You are
left with the impression that, while he has nothing against you, he
really could see you far enough.
Robbie Coltrane is a good actor; an award winning actor. But he is
particularly good at playing himself. With Fitz, the flawed genius of a
psychologist in Cracker, what you see is what you get. And what you get
is Coltrane playing Coltrane. That is its strength. When you play
yourself you can't go wrong because it is truth.
Ironically, it was not so long ago when he was accused of not playing
himself; of using funny voices and theatrical personnas as a mask in the
commission of his real life. Those were the hellraising days (a
ubiquitous period for all young actors) when he tanned whisky by the
bottle and smoked fags like there was no tomorrow. And maybe there
wouldn't have been if he'd carried on. But now he's stopped.
His upbringing was middle class Rutherglen and he went to school at
Glenalmond. And yet he seems so much more working class. You just
couldn't imagine this man singing ''Swing Low Sweet Chariot'' and
clasping a pint of ale to his chest in the rugby club with the rest of
the chaps. It is also hard to get your head round the fact that he went
to art college and not drama school. More or less everything he has
learned about acting has come through the experience of actually doing
it.
So when you talk to Robbie Coltrane, you set yourself a challenge; can
you conduct this brief interview (he only has 15 minutes) without asking
an inane question about Cracker? You start by steering clear of the
subject and ask him what he thinks of these actors' studio sessions.
This, he reveals, is the first one he has ever done. ''What it does,''
he says, ''is give you the chance as a practitioner to speak to people
who have not had much experience really. There is the advantage in the
fact that you are not a teacher because they already know the theory.
You can help because you've had a go at it. I always think it is
interesting for actors to hear how other people have approached
challenges.''
What is he working on at present? Well, he explains, he is doing a
spot of writing and also preparing himself psychologically for the next
series of Cracker which is looking ''very exciting'' (he arches his
eyebrows and makes very exciting sound melodramatic with that sort of
Edgar Lustgarten accent he's so good at).
You jocularly remark that you were trying not to bring this most
obvious of touchy subjects up in the conversation. However, in the
circumstances, you're glad that he did. No I didn't, he says,
poker-faced. It was you when you asked me what I was working on. You
concede the point because, well, life's short enough, really.
But, since you/I mentioned it, Robbie, what do you think of all those
lurid yellow press stories that seem to dog Cracker?
''There's nothing to be said about it. A lot of people have decided to
write newspapers and then they decide they've got to sell them. It's
between them and their conscience. Not me,'' he replies.
Then he asks you if you're planning to stay for the workshop
downstairs. Yes, you reply, looking forward to it. His face goes all
serious. Is there a problem? Well there might be. It is really up to the
participants, he says. It is their workshop and it is up to them (which
is fair enough). He will have to ask them. Suddenly, you have a vision
of the Great Embarrassing Moment of your life, getting chucked out of
the lecture theatre. In the event, he doesn't ask them.
Which is good news because, in the event, it is a privilege to listen
to Robbie Coltrane expounding on humour. Never once does he say that
comedy is all about timing. Good comedy, he says, is all about having
the perfect comic memory and then having the ability to project that to
other people.
''A good comedian is someone who can recreate the moment when it
really happened. So that people can feel that they are actually there
when something happened -- and that, of course, is the great trick.
''A lot of people say that comedy lies between the way we like to
think of ourselves and the way we really are. It is true that, for
people who commit suicide, that distance is unbearable. This is very
seminal, very important, to us. It's a way of coping with the darkness
between the people we are and the people we pretend to be,'' he
explains. This is serious stuff.
Then he lightens the load, telling his drama students that there's
nothing wrong with plagiarism. Find someone you admire, watch what they
do, and imitate them. He also goes on to applaud the fact that the line
between comedy and drama has become blurred.
''It started with programmes like Tutti Frutti and Boys From The
Blackstuff. And Dennis Potter was great at it. He pointed out that
no-one's life is totally tragic and no-one's life is totally funny. This
crossover between comedy and drama has been responsible for the way
producers have stopped pigeon-holing actors,'' he adds.
And so he moves on to what he describes as the theatre of cruelty,
specifically, alternative comedy. This, he says, came out of the
realisation in the sixties and seventies that stand-up comedy, up till
then, had been about being in one group and slagging off another group.
''Alternative comedy said that it was fine to laugh at people but
let's laugh at the powerful people, the people who run our lives. Not
cripples, or blacks, or gays, or women but the people who make the
decisions in our life; the judges, the politicians,'' he says.
He points out that a curious thing about comedy, even alternative
comedy, is the fact that it fights against generalisation. But it only
works if you do generalise. Modern ''recognition comedy'' (which is
dependent on the audience identifying with the comic's subject matter)
by its very nature had to generalise.
The power of comedy should not be underestimated. It was culturally
every bit as important as drama. Coltrane reckons that, if someone from
outer space wanted to know what life was like in the 1950s, he would be
far better to get a tape of Tony Hancock than John Osborne. Personally,
I reckon if the Klingons (not the funniest race in the Federation) want
to develop a sense of humour they'd be well advised to get a video of
Coltrane.

THE Scottish comedian Denny Willis, one of the last great troupers of
the variety halls, has died suddenly in London. He was in his late
seventies.
Denny Willis inherited the comedy genius of his father, Dave Willis,
and his slightest gesture could produce great gales of laughter.
Jimmy Logan said last night: ''Denny was very economical in his
working style but always got the maximum effect. All he had to do was
raise a little finger or do that apologetic little cough of his.''
When doing fall-about comedy, his timing was immaculate and he became
known all over Europe, particularly in East Germany and Holland, for his
Hunting Quartet routine. He spent years touring with the Fol-de-Rols
company.
In the 1930s, he spent time in Ayr, when his father was star of the
Gaiety Whirl summer shows. At that time, he contemplated a showjumping
career. However, in 1935 he deputised in the tap-dancing double act of
Tips and Taps when one partner dropped out. He remained with the act,
renamed Willis and Wills.
During war service an Army chaplain discovered that Private D D
Williams (the family name) was the son of Dave Willis, and he became a
member of concert parties as a comedian.
After the war, he appeared on stage briefly as Dave Willis Jr. His
uncle, Claud Williams, was also a funny man, known on stage as The Great
Claud, a spoof magician.
Although in his late seventies, Denny Willis looked much younger,
having been a fitness enthusiast all his life.
Right to the end, he walked four miles a day with his Yorkshire
terrier, Bimbo, and exercised on his rowing machine. He had been putting
the dog's lead on when he fell over. His wife, Rey, said jokingly: ''We
don't want any of your silly walks just now,'' before realising he was
ill.
Denny Willis was respected by his peers as a complete professional and
a gentleman who would always go out of his way to help others.
His father died practically penniless, having been ill-advised in a
hotel business venture. Denny, determined not to fall into the same
trap, was careful with his money, and bought property in London.
He did not touch alcohol and the high life was never for him. On tour,
he lived in his caravan or with his actress daughter, Bobbi, in Glasgow.
Bobbi said: ''Dad loved animals and his garden. Apart from Bimbo, he
had a cat, Sarah. And there are two goldfish, which appeared on stage in
his last panto.''
Dorothy Paul, who appeared with him in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
at the Mitchell, Glasgow, two years ago, said: ''Whenever I think of
him, I get a wee glow. He was a magic man, a one off. So unassuming. His
voice was so quiet, yet it could be heard in every part of the
theatre.''

Fanatical nationalists in South Africa remain hostile to the Queen, as
Patrick Laurence reports from Johannesburg.
THIRTY-FIVE years ago yesterday police opened fire on a crowd of black
civilians outside a police station in Sharpeville, a little-known
township about 25 miles south of Johannesburg. When the firing stopped,
69 people lay dead and many more were screaming in pain as they hobbled
and crawled away. Most had been shot in the back, felled by bullets as
they fled for their lives.
The massacre -- comparable perhaps to the slaughter of Indian
civilians by a British general at Amritsar in 1919 -- marked a turning
point in the campaign against white minority rule in South Africa.
Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black president, at the
presidential Office in Cape Town on Monday, marked another turn of the
historical wheel. The last South African to receive the Order of Merit
before President Mandela was Prime Minister Jan Smuts, the Afrikaner
leader and former Boer general, who invited the royal family to South
Africa in 1947.
Smuts, however, was seen as a traitor to the Afrikaner nationalist
cause by Afrikaner radicals, a man who had been seduced by the British
Empire to become an Anglophile. One of the Afrikaner nationalist leaders
who expressed his contempt of Smuts and the royal family was Hendrik
Verwoerd, who later became known as the ''high priest'' of apartheid.
At the time Verwoerd was the editor of Die Transvaler, the official
voice of Afrikaner nationalism. He expressed his contempt for King
George VI and his family by ignoring them. Not a word appeared in his
newspaper about the royal visitors.
Verwoerd, an avowed republican, was Prime Minister at the time of
Sharpeville. Known to his followers as the man of granite, Verwoerd
adopted a lofty attitude towards the massacre. He assured South Africans
that his government had the situation under control and offered them a
cyclical -- some would say cynical -- interpretation of the
bloodletting.
It had nothing to do with apartheid but was part of a more generalised
turmoil which ebbed and flowed ''in cycles'', Verwoerd insisted. He was
quick to argue that there had been worse troubles in the Congo and
Nyasaland (later renamed Zaire and Malawi) and to point out that Smuts
himself had to contend with ''restless natives''.
With sublime confidence Verwoerd pressed ahead with his plans to
establish a withdrawal from the Commonwealth, a move he undertook
because of the ''spirit of hostility . . . even of vindictiveness''
shown to South Africa at a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in London by
Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and -- worst of all,
in Verwoerd's view -- John Diefenbaker of Canada.
The animosity displayed by Verwoerd to the British royal family is not
yet dead: it was reflected in the acid reference to the Queen by Robert
Van Tonder, leader of the Boerevolk Party, as ''Elizabeth Windsor''. Van
Tonder labelled her a descendant of the cruel British queen (Queen
Victoria) who, he declared, herded Afrikaner women and children into
concentration camps during the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902.
Fanatical nationalists like Van Tonder represent a dwindling minority
of Afrikaners today. One of the political leaders who visited the Queen
aboard the Britannia was Deputy President F W de Klerk, whose
grandparents were among the Afrikaners incarcerated by the British
during the Anglo-Boer war.
After his exchange of views with Queen Elizabeth, de Klerk pointedly
stressed that the reconciliation between Boer and Briton was complete
and that the spirit of reconciliation was now fusing new bonds between
white and black South Africans.
But reconciliation between Boer and Briton has not led to a resurgence
of the vast cheering crowds who were far short of wild enthusiasm.
A survey commissioned on South African attitudes to the British royal
family by the Johannesburg Star showed the vast majority of citizens --
70% -- would not go out of their way to see Queen Elizabeth or her
husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.
Even the minority of pro-British royal family South Africans were not
particularly pleased by the presence of Queen Elizabeth: they would have
preferred Princess Diana to have visited South Africa.
The Queen, however, was given a standing ovation when she addressed a
joint sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate. In her speech --
labelled a ''gentle breeze of approval'' in contrast to the ''Winds of
Change'' speech delivered by British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
shortly before the Sharpeville massacre in 1960 -- she praised South
Africa's leaders for their patient and successful quest for peace and
reconciliation.
'You have become one nation, whose spirit of reconciliation is a
shining example to the rest of the world,'' she said.

POLICE frogmen are preparing to probe the depths of Loch Lomond today
in the hunt for water-works joiner Kevin McGuire, who has been missing
since he walked out of his home by Loch Katrine on Hogmanay after a row
with his wife.
His case was highlighted on Friday in the TV programme Missing and
London Weekend TV said later that it had received ''interesting
information''.
Inspector Bill Rose, who is leading the inquiry into Mr McGuire's
disappearance, said yesterday that the programme had produced a number
of calls but no definite information.
''We're still compiling information and that may take some time,'' he
said. ''There's nothing positive yet but it's still early days.''
He said people had telephoned the television company saying they
recalled seeing parts of Mr McGuire's car registration but no-one had
come forward saying they had definitely seen his metallic green Saab
with the registration number F22 RAC.
Officers from Central Scotland Police's underwater unit have not
searched the bed of Loch Lomond around Inversnaid pier before now owing
to the depth and technical difficulty of the dive.
The pier lies on a direct road from Mr McGuire's home at
Stronachlacher, about four miles away, and police want to eliminate the
possibility that his car went into the waters of the loch after he drove
off angrily minutes before the new year.
After he failed to return, his wife Lisa, 24, made an emotional plea
for him to contact either her, his parents. or the police.
Mr McGuire, who worked for Strathclyde Regional Council's water
department, is 5ft 10in, well built, and has short brown hair.

<HEADLINE>Sham recovery in jobs, says Labour</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S recent gain in jobs consists entirely of part-time work.
Official statistics show that 2288 jobs were created between the start
of the recovery last March and the latest figures in December. Yet
closer analysis reveals that the huge loss of 7600 full-time jobs was
offset by the creation of 9900 part-time jobs.
Surprisingly the largest area of part-time work growth has been in
male employment, where 6526 jobs were created, dwarfing the loss of 3054
full-time jobs.
Mr Jack McConnell, Scottish general secretary of the Labour Party,
yesterday claimed the figures revealed that the so-called recovery was a
sham.
''The Government has concocted figures to try to show that work
prospects are improving -- but no-one is fooled,'' he said.
''We have said all along that the figures do not show the true level
of job insecurity and unemployment that exists in Scotland.
''This Government has no long-term economic strategy for stable growth
based on manufacturing industry.''
Mr McConnell said part-time workers were far more vulnerable than
full-time employees. ''Part-time jobs are not necessarily worse than
full-time but the reality is insecurity for employees. ''
The employment figures were prepared for the General and Municipal
Boilermakers union by the Government-backed National Online Manpower
Information System at the University of Durham.
They also show that in the last quarter of 1994, the months from
September to December, Scotland had one of the weakest growth rates in
the UK at 0.1%.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB, said: ''These numbers
graphically demonstrate why Kenneth Clarke is right about the absence of
the feel-good factor.
''Our economy and credit systems are based upon full-time employment
and prosperity in the housing market. This move to part-time work,
largely in low-paid, insecure sectors, is undermining the recovery.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said any increase in employment,
whether full or part-time, was to be welcomed.
''The growth in part-time employment, which can mean working up to 30
hours a week, has resulted from a combination of employers seeking a
more flexible workforce and the existence of a significant number of
people wanting to work part-time.
''According to the Autumn 1994 Labour Force Survey, only 14% of those
surveyed who were working part-time did so because they could not find a
full-time job. The majority actually preferred part-time work.''

THE Government yesterday was urged to introduce a new type of petrol
which could cut dangerous car exhaust fumes by 25%.
Oxygenated petrol could be introduced with no alterations to cars or
petrol pumps and at minimal cost to the consumer, said Mr Jim Dowd, the
Labour MP for Lewisham West.
However, the UK Petrol Retailers Association questioned how clean the
new petrol really was. It was concerned that it could lead to the spread
of a the pollutant methyl tertiary butyl ether.
Oxygenated petrol, which has added oxygen and reduced aromatics,
making it cleaner burning than conventional petrol, has been widely used
in the United States since the introduction of the 1990 Clean Air Act.

PERHAPS it is because of her own television career that Helen
Pennant-Rea managed to keep so cool while pursued by the press.
Taking a tip from Lord and Lady Archer, she smiled and served tea to
reporters waiting outside her home. The still-trim blonde, 49, even
cracked a good-humoured joke. ''I almost gave you a Bank of England
mug!'' she said.
Her father is Lord Jay, formerly a Labour President of the Board of
Trade, and her brother, Peter, is BBC TV's economics editor.
Helen and twin sister Catherine were mini-skirted beauties in the
swinging sixties, photographed by David Bailey, appearing as cover girls
for Tatler and Honey and featuring frequently in the society columns.
They both studied politics and sociology at Sussex University then
moved into television.
Helen enjoyed ''rather a jet-set life'', she said last year. ''I did
things like jetting to Spain for the weekend and going to New York.
''I was meeting people like Jimmy Goldsmith, John Aspinall, Lord
Lucan.
''They called me a 'champagne pinky' because they were fascinated by
my left-wing politics and yet I obviously enjoyed champagne.''
She was a researcher on current affairs programmes during the 1970s
and 1980s, including Nationwide, Robin Day's The Sunday Debate, and
Channel 4's Right to Reply.
In 1975 she married Mr David Kennard, a BBC colleague, and they had
two daughters, Amanda and Juliet, but she said that the relationship
foundered when he wanted to go and live in America.
She divorced and married Mr Pennant Rea, the then editor of the
Economist, in 1986, five days after his divorce on the grounds of his
previous wife Jane's adultery, and two months before the birth of their
son, Edward.
Mrs Pennant-Rea explained why she appeared to take this week's
revelations in her stride. ''I have known about this for about a year,
and that's probably why I seem fine,'' she said.
''It has been a question of waiting for a knock on the door.''
She recently said that she has been quite content to stay at home in
their Cotswolds mansion.
''I used to think it must be boring for people at these rather grand
City dinners to be stuck next to me, but Rupert has impressed upon me
that in the evening they don't want to talk about inflation, they would
rather talk about children and holidays and theatre.
''The funny thing is that after being at home all day, I would rather
talk about economics!''

<HEADLINE>Paisley MP seeks tighter curbs on drug</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979271925</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCOTS MP has launched a campaign for tighter curbs on the supply of
a drug which can change the personality of users, and which she claims
is behind the latest crime wave in Paisley.
In talks yesterday with Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser, Paisley
North MP Irene Adams called for tougher restrictions to dry up the
supply of the tablets.
Mrs Adams is appealing to the Government to designate Temazepam a
controlled drug and is also pressing for tighter prescription curbs.
The MP is concerned over the recent spate of shootings in her
constituency, and police have confirmed that the upsurge of gun violence
in the town is drug-related, involving rival factions within the drugs
culture.
Following her meeting in London yesterday, Mrs Adams said: ''I have
always been reluctant to call for an outright ban, believing that
doctors know best about prescribing medicines to patients.
''Sadly, I am now convinced things have reached such a pitch that a
ban may be the only answer.''
The Labour MP says she is satisfied that Temazepam was at the root of
the recent escalation of violence.
Mrs Adams added: ''The volume of drugs available can mean only one
thing -- a breakdown somewhere in the pharmaceutical chain -- and some
people are making a lot of money peddling this vile trade.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office confirmed last night that Lord
Fraser was prepared to raise the possible classification of Temazepam
with health Ministers, had taken on board Mrs Adams' concerns, and would
be considering if further guidance on the prescription of the drugs
would be appropriate.
He added: ''Greater Glasgow and Argyll and Clyde health boards have
already applied voluntary bans on prescribing Temgesic and gel-filled
Temazepam capsules.''

Lord Gill, argues for a root-and-branch reform of Scotland's civil
justice system.
MY retirement date, in theory at least, will be 2017. If I am still
around by then, I will be greatly disappointed if the system of civil
justice in Scotland remotely resembles the present model.
Criminal justice, the cost of it and the inadequacies of it, are
subjects of unfailing fascination for the public. Reform in the criminal
field readily attracts the attention of the media.
Civil justice is less attractive. In my view, the disparity between
the pace of reform in criminal and in civil procedure has become a
matter for serious concern.
I wish to argue two general propositions: that our system of civil
procedure is a contemporary relic of a vanished age which is ill-serving
the litigant; and that the familiar piecemeal approach to reform must
give place to a comprehensive review of civil justice with no assumption
in favour of the status quo in which the public should have a proper
voice.
We must always remember that the system exists to serve the public, as
do those of us who play our parts in it. The public are entitled to
demand that it serves their needs.
What then do they ask of us? I suggest three things; expeditious
procedure, conducted at an economical cost appropriate to the nature of
the case, leading to a just and reliable result.
If the law fails to meet the public's needs there is the ever-present
danger of less savoury methods of dispute resolution such as
unscrupulous debt collection or criminal ''self-help''.
The civil procedures of the Scottish courts have always been a cause
for pride among our writers and, in my view, for complacency among
practitioners.
The basic structure of civil litigation is that which has endured
from, at latest, the Court of Session Act 1825, namely summons and
defence, or petition and answers, adjustment, closed record, debate or
proof.
In essence, our system of civil justice faithfully applies a tradition
of nearly two centuries. Twenty years ago that would have been our
boast. Today, it should be our complaint.
This complacency has continued until today . . . in the seeming
indifference of the profession to honest expressions of amazement by
litigants and witnesses as to its complexities, costs and delays.
The impatience of the public is there to see. It is to be seen in the
frustrated client who asks the question, when?; in the expert whose own
search for the truth has become distorted by forensic tactics; in the
frustrated witness who spends a day or more in an inhospitable waiting
room only to be sent away.
Evidence abounds of the law's delays -- where a dispute over custody
of a child begins when the child is just over two and comes to proof
when the child is almost seven.
In 1994, 3960 actions were raised in the Court of Session. Of these
2023 were actions of damages for personal injury. A further 3936 such
actions were already pending at the beginning of the year. It is my
clear impression, and that of most of my colleagues, that many of these
personal injury litigations have no place in the Court of Session. They
are important to the pursuers, of course. But most of them raise no
question of the law. Many of them are worth no more than some few
thousand pounds on full liabilty.
If such actions do not settle, the cost of hearing them far exceeds
their true value. Is this an appropriate use of the specialist resources
of the Supreme Court? We must begin by transferring the primary
responsibility for the progress of litigation from the litigant's
advisers to the court itself.
There are two very good and straightforward reasons for that. The
profession represents its clients and not the public. In almost every
litigation, one party has good reason not to rush to judgment.
In other words, we must move from the idea of the judge as the passive
arbiter to that of the judge as manager of the litigation.
There is an abundance of evidence that a substantial part of judicial
time is spent in procedural firefighting, rectifying errors, extending
deadlines and ruling on amendments.
In the higher courts, judges should not be deflected from their task
of explaining and developing the law by the stresses of a workload of
cases more suitable for the lower courts, or of a workload of procedural
wrangles which a streamlined system could avoid.
We have also reached the stage where an increasing statutory
complexity and the proliferation of case law make it appropriate to
allocate judges to specialist areas of law. This probably means the
division of the court into a number of specialist departments. In this
respect there may be much to learn from England.
As to the form of pleadings, what can justify the baroque formularies
which are still characteristic of grounds of fault, prayers of petition,
calls of summonses and the like? The priority is the institution of a
comprehensive civil justice review in which every aspect of the status
quo is open to question. In all of its deliberations such a review would
have as its paramount consideration the interests of the public.
My own preference would be for abbreviated statements of case and
answers, for fixed diets of hearing, allocated at the outset of the
case, with advance lodging of written arguments or of witness
statements.
In the Copyright Tribunal, of which I was deputy chairman, it is
normal to proceed straight to a hearing on cases involving millions of
pounds on simple statements of case.
So how can we justify the elaborate and time-consuming procedures and
evidential requirements which have to be undergone in simple reparation
(compensation) actions? The judiciary and the profession should be the
promoters of reform. They should do so before public dissatisfaction
forces the issue.

<TEXT>
RUPERT Pennant-Rea had an aura of cautious, unflappable
self-determination -- a man used to getting what he wanted.
On Sunday morning, Mr Pennant-Rea, 47, who has been married three
times, woke to find his present marriage and his job as Bank of England
deputy governor under scrutiny, because of an affair which began in 1991
and ended acrimoniously last year.
His wife, Helen, had to read in Sunday's newspapers:
* How her husband had made love to journalist Mary Ellen Synon on the
carpet of the dressing room of Bank of England Governor Eddie George in
the City.
* How Mr Pennant-Rea wrote joke cheques setting out his feelings for
his lover.
* How he used crucial Bank conference time to compose love letters to
the woman.
But how could such a formidably intelligent person get himself into a
fix which threatened his widely-predicted succession to Eddie George as
well as his family life?
In the buttoned-down world of banking, the 6ft 3in Mr Pennant-Rea is
something of a maverick -- a former trade unionist who wants cannabis
smoking legalised.
Educated in Ireland, he first met Mary Ellen when both were students
at Trinity College, Dublin.
He readily admits to a belief in love at first sight, and his record
of three marriages certainly bears this out.
Born in Rhodesia, the raffish Mr Pennant-Rea went on to work for the
General and Municipal Workers' Union.
He then switched to the Bank of England as an economist during the
Seventies and later worked for the Social Democrats.
In 1986, he was appointed editor of the Economist after being spotted
by Sarah Hogg.
Later when she was appointed as John Major's special adviser, she
played a key role in Mr Pennant-Rea's move to the deputy governor's post
in July 1993. It was an appointment that surprised the City.
Miss Synon, who was born in America, was also drawn to journalism and
worked on newspapers in Ireland, Britain, and South Africa before
herself moving to the Economist.
In Fleet Street, she became known as the Ice Queen, because she
repeatedly rejected amorous advances from colleagues.
Mr Pennant-Rea and Ms Synon began their affair in 1991. He took her on
a cruise and then to business trips in the United States.
He went on to bombard his mistress with more than 200 letters, all of
which she kept with the date-stamped envelopes in a John Lewis carrier
bag.
Miss Synon said of Mr Pennant-Rea: ''He swore he loved me and promised
to leave his wife, but in the end he ditched me for the sake of
appearances at the Bank.
''His whole conduct towards me in the end was selfish and obsessive.
He used me for sex while he was abusing his position at the Bank and
within his family.''
The banker may have thought his mistress was a disposable luxury, but
is reported to have been panic-stricken when faced with the threat of
exposure, staggering on to the railway line at Clapham Junction with
thoughts of suicide apparently in his mind.
On Sunday, he responded calmly to the newspaper revelations: ''I have
discussed the position with the Governor and we are both entirely
satisfied that I remain able to function effectively as deputy.''
That was not to be the final scene, which Ms Synon, 44, was reportedly
anticipating: ''Nothing would give me more pleasure than to see him lose
his job and his perks.''

FORMER Scottish rugby captain David Sole is preparing to wrest a truly
''world'' record from a London monk.
On May 2, he will take off from Heathrow Airport, London, on a journey
of at least 24,859.75 miles, which he hopes to complete within 4000
minutes (66 hours).
He is attempting to break the record for the circumnavigation of the
world, by scheduled airline flights passing through two antipodal points
and returning to London, to raise money for the Gordon Highlanders
Museum Campaign.
The campaign was launched a year ago to purchase and develop the
regimental museum at St Luke's in Aberdeen to ensure something from the
regimentis preserved.
The idea came from the former chief executive of Grampian Television,
Mr Alex Mair, who took the record in 1992 as part of the Telethon
campaign. His record was broken by Brother Michael Bartlett from London.
Sole, purchasing manager with United Distillers in Edinburgh, said:
''I come from Strathdon and at one stage considered joining the army,
and it would have been the Gordon Highlanders I would have joined. I
have no idea what it is going to be like but imagine boredom might be
the biggest problem and that I will be able to recite the in-flight
movies verbatim when I return.'' The ticket is being provided by
American Express and people are invited to sponsor David Sole per 1000
miles.

Benedict Brogan talks to Health Minister Gerald Malone, who is
refusing to intervene as nurses and midwives display increasing
militancy over their pay claims.
MIDWIVES and nurses looking for a Government compromise on their pay
dispute should avoid Gerald Malone. The Health Minister has no intention
of undermining the pay review bodies. The money is there to fund a 3%
increase, but it is up to the nurses, midwives, and their officials to
make the case for it -- locally.
By voting 82% in favour of abandoning their long-held opposition to
industrial action, the nation's midwives have set off the political
panic alarms carried by each Tory back bencher facing unemployment at
the next election. With the Government so far down in the polls,
Ministers are not expected to annoy a profession considered sacrosanct
by the voters.
Gerald Malone, unsurprisingly, is not afraid. The ex-Scottish MP,
resurrected in 1992 as the Conservative MP for Winchester, insists that
the deal on offer has been misinterpreted. The money is there, he says,
for local trusts and health boards to add another 2% on top of the 1%
guaranteed by Government.
But he will not intervene. ''What I'm not in the business of doing is
being in favour of local pay, and then telling trusts as Minister what
they should pay. I'm not giving any direction to individual employers to
behave in a certain way. That would totally undermine what the review
body said should be an important move towards local pay.''
The local element, suggested by the pay review bodies for nursing,
midwifery and health visiting, and accepted by the Government last
month, unexpectedly forms the bulk of the offer. Instead of the local
element being a small add-on to a larger national offer, the pay bodies
suggested 1% basic with a local element varying between 0.5% and 2%.
They also suggested local alterations to nationally-set conditions of
service and allowances, which often make up 15% of pay.
Over coffee on large leather sofas in his sun-filled office, Malone
argues strongly that devolving pay decisions to local employers is a
logical reform. All he has to do is ensure that the money is available
to fund up to a 3% increase. But it is up to the employers to assess the
need, and to decide by how much they accept the pay board
recommendations.
Although he won't say it, the Government hopes that the trusts and
boards will save them embarrassment and go for the full 3%. Industrial
action, Malone says, would not be welcome.
Beneath the confidence and the easy jokes, Malone's approach is as
sharp as his dark suit. His argument is effectively about double
standards. The pay review body has delivered ''tremendous results'' for
nurses and midwives in the past, and they should be prepared to accept
its recommendations now.
''Sometimes Government has been forced to swallow hard, before
actually accepting what the review body has said. But we've done it.
This may be an occasion where everything isn't to their liking, and it
may be a year where they have to swallow quite hard, too.''
Gerald Malone was briefly MP for Aberdeen South before falling victim
to the clear-out of Tory MPs in Scotland in 1987. Before that, he was a
lawyer in the family firm in Glasgow -- he is from a Tory-voting,
professional Glasgow family -- with a string of unsuccessful attempts to
get to Westminster.
He filled his time out of Parliament looking for a safe seat and
editing the Scottish edition of the Sunday Times. He and Andrew Neil,
the former Sunday Times editor and scourge of the Establishment, have
been inseparable since their days running Glasgow University
Conservative Association in the sixties. The relationship has earned
Malone enemies by association: in certain circles to be a friend of
Neil's is crime enough.
On his return to Westminster, John Major made him deputy chairman of
the party. Against a Cabinet of gaffe-prone misfits, his presentational
skills are admired, and he is talked about as a future chairman.
With Virginia Bottomley's sanctimoniousness beginning to wear, Malone
has emerged as the voice of the Department of Health, unflappable even
when defending against the seemingly universal fear of a collapsing NHS.
Civil servants speak admiringly of the speed with which he has mastered
his complex brief since he took it on last summer.
He wants to get the ''message'' of NHS reforms right, but recognises
it is not easy. He identifies two trends: ''There is a private
perception of the NHS based on an individual's experience and there is
the public perception of the NHS which is very different and much less
flattering. Part of my job is to ensure these two match each other far
more than they have. We plough on.''
The cultural switch from Scotland to Hampshire was effortless -- ''far
easier for a Glaswegian to move to Hampshire than Aberdeen'' -- and he
increased the Tory majority. He finds a message for Scottish politics in
the acceptance he has found as a carpet-bagger: ''The people of
Winchester are not obssessed with the fact that I come from Scotland and
represent an English seat.
''I think that the attitude in Scotland is now very different and I
wonder if that says something about the deterioration of what used to be
a welcome tolerance in Scotland.''
He is happy to condemn dissension within Tory ranks. Lord McAlpine's
recent suggestion that the party needs a spell in Opposition to recharge
its policy batteries is dismissed as the absurd idea of ''a lord who
lives in Venice'' -- a jab at Lord McAlpine's preference for long months
at his Italian palazzo.
''This is rubbish. There is always an agenda for Government. I think
it a rather ludicrous abdication of responsibility to say that you can
meekly hand over to the other side for a bit and an arrogance to think
that you can assume that you would automatically return to power
thereafter.''
At 44, Gerald Malone is still young in political terms. He is too
brash and articulate for some -- smooth is frequent description. He is
ambitious, but doesn't like talking about it. Are there any limits? The
laugh is long. ''No, there's no depth to which I'm not prepared to sink.
I'm always happy to get on with the task I'm asked to do.''

Cyberpunks in silver catsuits, clingy synthetics and shiny nylon . . .
Out of this world? Not at all, says Francesca Fearon, there is an
undercurrent of wearability here. And, with a few minor alterations,
this is the shape of things to come
THE Paris autumn/winter 1995 fashion collections are like a double
A-sided record. This bumper offering spun out over the past week plays a
wild and wacky theme on one side -- the sort of spectacle that earns
splash headlines and front-page photo opportunities. On the flipside,
realism steps in and the precious decadence is peeled away to reveal
what women really want to know -- what they will actually be wearing
next season.
Blitzing the headlines this season is the glam, futuristic cyberpunk
vision. Jean-Paul Gaultier's whip-carrying cyberpunks wore hooded
circuit-board print catsuits with bustle-bowed basques or tailoring.
Neoprene was moulded into big fit-and-flare coats and astonishing
ballgowns were shaped out of brightly coloured sleeping-bags. It was an
extraordinary exhibition of sci-fi fashion interspersed with clever
mohair and wool jersey tailoring.
Thierry Mugler's gladiatorial robo-fashion provided the climax to his
twentieth-anniversary collection, which was otherwise a pure Busby
Berkeley extravaganza starring Tippi Hedren (the Hitchcock star), Patty
Hearst (doing a spangled striptease), Jerry Hall, Elle Macpherson, and
Marie Helvin along with a silver-catsuited cyborg who could have starred
in Fritz Lang's Metropolis.
Shiny nylon surfaces, PVC, plexiglass (which Mugler used), and clingy
synthetics, fresh from the laboratory, are being moulded, bonded and
velcroed together. Helmut Lang used rubber-backed crepe for modern
couture shapes that are far removed from his anarchic street-fashion
roots. Issey Miyake shaped masculine suits from a coated chiffon that
resembles coloured clingfilm and has pioneered bubble-jet
colour-printing on leather with romantic floral designs.
Such experiments with fabric technology so tempted the couturier,
Ungaro, to briefly veer away from his favourite tweeds and floral prints
into tender-looking plastic-coated chiffons and hologram fabrics for
evening wear. Ann Demeulemeester showed that even traditional fabrics
like satin and shot taffeta give a clean, sharp look to tailored wool
garbardine, crepe and mohair tweed. Nylon lurex, pearlised leather, and
glassy synthetic finishes hone a modern edge to the classic tailoring
that still dominates the catwalk.
Such irresistible fabrics are only part of the story this autumn,
which sees the fashion silhouette softening from the rigorous hour-glass
shape proposed for spring. Proportions are long and slim, with jackets
curving into the waist rather than cinching it, although several
designers produced little peplum jackets that flirt with the hipline.
Karl Lagerfeld, Christian Lacroix, and Sonia Rykiel all shaped longer,
leaner proportions which they lavished with fake fur trims -- a key
accessory.
Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano are among the handful who vested
any historical reference in their collections. Galliano combined elegant
African and Spanish influences in a collection that conjured up memories
of the late great Spanish couturier, Balenciaga. Westwood's cocotte had
a purposeful county air with her tweeds, tartans and headscarf, circa
late fifties, combined with an exaggerated pointed bustline that would
even have impressed Jayne Mansfield. However, mellow the provocative
silhouette and you are left with clothes that blend style with substance
echoing the undercurrent theme of the Paris collections, wearability.

A MAN jailed for knocking down four cyclists when drunk, killing one,
is suing for #3500 for a thumb injured in jail.
George Brodie, 49, sentenced to eight years in 1990, alleges the
injury was sustained when he slipped on a wet, tiled floor in the toilet
area of Porterfield Prison, Inverness, during the now-discontinued
practice of ''slopping-out''. He originally sought #20,000 in damages.
Brodie, of Avoch, Ross-shire, was told by Sheriff James Fraser at
Inverness yesterday that he would have to wait at least six weeks for
his ruling on the civil claim, made against the Scottish Secretary.
Brodie's agent, Mr Fraser Simpson, accused the prison authorities of
negligence in failing to ensure the washroom floor was in a safe
condition on April 15, 1991.
The accident happened on remand about six weeks before Brodie was
sentenced for ploughing through cylists on a Land's End to John O'Groats
charity run while drink-driving.
Mr Graham Scarisbrick-Smith, 29, was killed and three others seriously
injured in the accident, near the Kessock Bridge. Brodie did not stop
after the accident.
He wants compensation for the alleged injury, which he says will limit
potential earnings when he leaves prison.
Robert MacDougall, 42, senior prison officer at Porterfield, said
yesterday he could not recall ever receiving a complaint about the
condition of the tiled floor in the toilet area. ''Spillages were always
minor, there were regular inspections by the prison governor, and the
floor was never dangerous.''
He also denied that there was a ''mad rush'' to use toilets and
showers each morning because not enough time was given to prisoners for
washing before breakfast.
Prison nurse officers had no recollection of treating Brodie when he
claims the accident took place, but he had been taken briefly to
hospital two weeks later.
Mr Mark Lindsay, lawyer for the Scottish Office, said: ''It is very
strange that there were no witnesses to the accident, since part of Mr
Brodie's claim rests on the suggestion there was a mad rush to use
toilet facilities.''
He said the prison authorities had taken reasonable care to avoid
slippages in the washroom but Mr Simpson, Brodie's agent, said there was
clear evidence of a breach of duty by prison authorities. He claimed:
''There were regular complaints by prisoners about the dangerous state
of the washroom floor, which fell on deaf ears.''
Mr Simpson added: ''Prison is not intended to be a fun place but in
every civilised society there must be a reasonable expectation that
prisoners will not come to harm.

LABOUR MP George Foulkes yesterday advised the M77 protesters to
''pack their tents and return home and stop creating hazards and dangers
for other people.''
This follows a letter to him from Scottish Secretary Ian Lang,
promising his ''complete support for the project.''
Mr Lang spoke of ''my unswerving determination that the contract
should be completed to schedule.''
In a lengthy letter to Ayrshire MPs who met him earlier this month, Mr
Lang countered the criticisms of the opponents of the road.
Although construction of the motorway requires three thousand trees to
be felled, he said, almost half the thousand trees within the City of
Glasgow area were already diseased or dying and 125,000 new trees would
be planted within the Pollok Estate with the agreement of the National
Trust.
Mr Lang said that landscaped reserves such as were being created
alongside the new road were recognised by ecology experts to ''provide
important and often diverse habitats or wildlife corridors.''
The road would not just benefit commuters in wealthy areas, as the
protesters claimed, but would be a major communication link for
strategic traffic, particularly that bound for Ayrshire.
Far from harming the environment Mr Lang said construction would
result in new footpaths, play areas and environmental improvements
planned for the Corkerhill, Kennishead and Pollok Estate areas.
In addition, the Scottish Secretary said the road should reduce noise
and air pollution and cut road casualties.
Mr Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, said it was ''one
of the most comprehensive and compelling letters I have ever seen from a
Government Minister'' which ''explodes the myths of the M77.''

ONE of the children at the centre of the Ayrshire sex abuse case is
reluctant to go home to his parents, the Court of Session was told
yesterday.
The other seven children involved in the case have now all been
reunited with their families.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and
Mayfield, was receiving the latest report on the children after the
court's ruling that, after a separation from their parents of nearly
five years, their return must not be rushed.
Sheriff Neil Gow decided in August 1990, that allegations of ritual
sexual abuse involving the children had been established and that the
eight children should be kept in local authority care.
However, a fresh inquiry was ordered by the Court of Session and last
month, in a report of more than 400 pages, Sheriff Colin Miller ruled
that the sex abuse claims had not been proved.
One girl, aged 15, was allowed home immediately, and the court ordered
a phased return for the rest under the supervision and guidance of
childcare experts.
Yesterday, Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, counsel for the parents of the L
family, told the court that the four children -- girls aged 15, 13, and
five, and an eight-year-old boy -- had been returned home under the
supervision of childcare experts last Wednesday. This was two days
earlier than expected.
Mr Jackson said there was nothing to indicate that there would be any
problems, but the family would continue to receive counselling, as would
be expected following such a traumatic experience.
Mr Edward Targowski, QC, for the F family, said that there had also
been a successful reunion between the parents and their two younger
sons, aged eight and six.
The couple had rented a house near the local authority home where the
children had been cared for, so the boys would be able to remain at the
same school.
However, the couple's 10-year-old son was in a different position.
Mr Targowski said: ''Quite clearly, there has been some reluctance so
far as he is concerned to return to the family home. It may well be that
his return will take some time, and also require expert assistance.''
The boy was still in the local authority home, but had contact with
his parents.
Mr Targowski said the parents were anxious to have their children
returned legally by a court order, as well as physically. If that was
done, some stability would return to the family and they would have the
feeling that things were returning to normal.
The parents accepted that they would need expert help and counselling,
and were willing to co-operate in that.
Lord Hope said that in view of the progress that had been made, the
court could bring the case to an end as far as the children were
concerned.
However, in view of the advice received from the childcare experts,
the judges felt it better that the F children be treated as a family
unit, and were not prepared to end the court's involvement with them at
this stage.
They appreciated the parent's concern but felt it was better to treat
the three children together, and called for up-to-date information for a
hearing on May 16.
Meanwhile, solicitor Michael Johnston, for parents, has demanded that
Strathclyde region holds an internal investigation into the handling by
social work officials of the abuse allegations, and says that if the
region fails to act, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang should order a public
inquiry.
Strathclyde's social work committee will today receive a report from
its social work director, Ms Mary Hartnoll, on Sheriff Miller's document
opening the way for the return home of the children.

<TEXT>
NOISY neighbours could face on-the-spot fines of #40 under tough new
rules being considered by the Government.
Ministers are determined to tackle a growing problem that has been
blamed for suicides, violence and even murder.
It is understood they are planning to give powers to environmental
health officers to seize hi-fi equipment from offenders -- and keep it
permanently if they cause a nuisance again.
The proposals apply to England and Wales. A spokeswoman for the
Scottish Office said last night that there were more powers under
existing Scots law to deal with noise problems, but it would be
consulting interested bodies, such as local authorities and the police,
to see if the law required to be strengthened.
Labour yesterday gave a qualified welcome to the prososals drawn up by
the Department of Environment's working party on neighbourhood noise and
due to go out for consultation.
The proposals would allow environmental health officers to take action
over noise that exceeded a specified decibel level according to the
circumstances in which the noise is being made.
The prime aim would be to cut noise in hours of darkness when the
greatest number of problems arise.
MPs are facing increasing pressure from constituents for action on
what is seen as an increasing menace.
Police have limited powers to intervene in disputes between neighbours
over noise and fear that in desperation more and more people could start
taking the law into their own hands.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson said: ''Noisy neighbours are
becoming a bigger and bigger problem and it is not just music.
''People seem to be becoming less concerned about the impact of their
activities on their neighbours and we would be willing to consider any
sensible propositions.''

A NEW deal for ambulance workers was announced yesterday, giving
front-line staff rises of up to 20%.
The Scottish Ambulance Service, which becomes an NHS trust next month,
said it was the first pay and conditions package from a trust to be
endorsed by the trade unions.
Mr Andrew Freemantle, chief executive of the SAS NHS Trust, said:
''The aim is to treat ambulance staff more like the professionals they
are and reward them appropriately.
''It is a good deal. We are bringing their position up more alongside
their colleagues within the police and fire services. We are not there
yet, but we are certainly getting closer.''
The package has been worked out within an overall 2.5% increase in the
service's #38m pay budget, by consolidating various allowances.
It will raise paramedics' salaries by a total 16% to #17,000. Pay for
ambulance technicians will rise to #16,000 and control assistants will
receive nearly 20% more.
Non-emergency drivers on patient transport services will gain least,
with a 1.5% increase, built up to 8.5% through incorporating allowances.
The deal also gets rid of holiday payments. Staff will be paid for a
42-hour week, but rostered for 40 to allow for overlapping shifts.
Preferential mortgage and loan rates have also been negotiated with the
Bank of Scotland.
Senior ambulance managers will have their own increase because of
higher pay scales, which will take effect when the service becomes a
trust.
Mr Freemantle declined to give details of the pay rises for himself
and other executives. He said they were in line with NHS guidelines and
would be revealed in its annual report.
The deal will be offered to the 2800 workforce later this week.
Mr John Lambie, head of health for Unison in Scotland, said the
approach by management had been a refreshing change to that adopted by
trusts south of the Border.

FORMER Minister Robert Hughes is facing a constituency attack over his
affair with a Commons secretary.
Tories in his Harrow West constituency have tabled a motion for debate
at their annual general meeting on Friday calling on him to
''demonstrate qualities worthy of a public figure''.
They are accusing the local party hierarchy of stifling discussion
when Mr Hughes -- who resigned as a Minister earlier this month --
peared before the executive committee last week, and appeared to have
won its backing.

''WHAT shall I ask?'' sometimes can be almost as agonising a matter
for the Leader of the Opposition as ''How shall I answer?'' is for the
Prime Minister. Mr Tony Blair yesterday decided to avoid the obvious and
take a longer view.
The obvious was the different timescale on which members of the same
Cabinet are working in computing the return of the missing ''feel-good
factor''.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke spread dismay in Tory hearts, especially
hearts with majorities under 10,000, with a careless remark which
suggested that voters may not be feeling good until after the next
General Election, a thought that created a feel-really-bad factor among
the aforesaid MPs. Home Secretary Michael Howard decided to take a
blither view and declared it would reappear ''well before the next
General Election''.
What with the Chancellor accusing Euro-sceptic Tories of damaging the
pound and the Government just before the Euro-sceptic votes were wanted
at the end of a debate last night on the Common Agriculural Policy, the
Cabinet appears to have lost its sense of timing.
All this is meat and drink to a Leader of the Opposition and, indeed,
his foot-soldiers. Mr Keith Hill (Streatham -- Lab.) pointed out that Mr
Major's pleas for peace on Europe had gone unheeded and the Chancellor
and Lord Tebbit were ''at each other's throats''. Didn't this show that
Mr Major lacked authority and was ''not up to the job''.
This was a good enough question to require to be left unanswered. Mr
Major suggested instead that Mr John Prescott did not agree with Mr
Blair on Europe any more than Mr Blair agrees with Mr Dennis Skinner.
Taking up Mr Hill's other point -- the absence of the famous factor --
he said the Government's policies offered the prospect of steadily
rising living standards and these would produce ''a very good feel-good
factor''. He did not put a date on when this would occur but must be
either believing or hoping that it will be before April 1997 when he
will be obliged to ask the nation how they feel.
Mr Hill, being a back bencher, is only allowed one supplementary
question. Mr Blair, being Leader of the Opposition, can have three. He
was thus well placed to highlight the Prime Minister's embarrassment
and, one imagines, anger at the unhelpful pronouncements of his
Chancellor.
Mr Blair opted for education instead. To the watching scribes above,
even those employed by the reputedly more serious broadsheets,
personalities are more fun than policies, so this was disappointing.
He started disastrously -- in a way that could have disqualified him
ever being Prime Minister of a nation of animal lovers -- by standing on
his Education spokesman's guide dog, Lucy. The dog whined in protest and
Mr Blair quickly made amends. ''I've just apologised to Mr Blunkett's
dog'' he announced.
He then taxed Mr Major with the admission by Education Secretary, Mrs
Gillian Shephard, that some schools and councils would face problems
given the level of funding they are to receive from the Government.
The Prime Minister boxed defensively offering up councils with
surpluses, too many administrators, and so on. Mr Blair backed him into
a corner with a couple of well placed supplementaries, but three
questions in this case were not enough and though Mr Blair had won on
points he hadn't achieved a knock-down.
Had he chosen the wrong subject? Well, more voters probably are more
worried about the education of their children and grandchildren than
care about the single currency and, besides, the three English teaching
unions yesterday had mounted an impressive lobby of Parliament by
teachers, councillors, governors and parents complaining about the lack
of funds.
So Mr Blair probably chose right especially, as it is a good bet that
the Tory Cabinet and party still will be at odds with each other next
week.

<HEADLINE>Students exploit loophole in grant</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>13</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979271940</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
STUDENTS have discovered a loophole in grant application procedures
which allows them to profit from travelling allowance expenses.
The National Union of Students last night conceded that students on
many campuses were exploiting it.
Its president in Scotland, Mr Douglas Trainer, said: ''We accept that
students are committing fraud, but the Government is at it as well.
Pressures on students are growing all the time. They are experiencing
severe financial difficulties.''
The Scottish Office has ordered an investigation into the fraud. An
official said: ''A Scottish-wide investigation has been ordered to
identify the students concerned. We will be evaluating the results of
our enquiries with a view to determining what action to take.''
The loophole allows students who claim to commute to university from
the parental home to claim up to #1000 net in travelling allowance
during the three-term academic year.
They are, in fact, incurring very small travelling expenses because
they live near their place of study.
The Student Awards Agency for Scotland grants a maximum of #70 a year
in travelling expenses to students who live within a reasonable walking
distance of their university.
However, students who tell their institution they are commuting from
their home towns and villages can claim a lump sum of #493, plus an
additional #3 a day, five days a week for the academic year, which has
approximately 30 weeks.
The awards agency can deduct #500 from the student grant because the
student is living at home but that can leave students who take advantage
of the loophole #450 better off -- although they will have to meet the
cost of accommodation.
A Dundee University student said: ''I have always said on the grant
form that I lived with my parents. It means that my grant is reduced by
#500 but last year I got a travelling expenses cheque for more than
#1000.
''As long as you remember to give your home address for the university
records, you cannot be found out.''
Students who live with their parents qualify for a maximum maintenance
grant of #1390, while those living away from home receive a maximum of
#1820.
Meanwhile, a survey carried out by the NUS in England, and sponsored
by National Westminster Bank, has shown that student hardship has
reached record levels, with two-thirds of students facing a financial
crisis.
The survey of 2000 students in Liverpool and Birmingham showed that
students are borrowing more and taking on more term-time, low-paid work
in an effort to make ends meet.

THE entire length of the A1 in Scotland will be monitored by speed
cameras, it was announced yesterday.
At present, nine camera sites are fixed on the road from
Berwick-upon-Tweed to Dunbar.
From next Monday, an extra seven sites will be installed from Dunbar
to Edinburgh, bringing the total to 16.
A leaflet informing drivers of the new speed cameras is being
distributed.
Councillor George Thomson, the SNP representative for Tranent North on
East Lothian District Council, said: ''I use the road from Tranent to
Haddington a couple of times a week.
''You see lunatic drivers speeding past you with their foot to the
floor going way over the speed limit.
''The Government have said there will be work done on the road between
Tranent and Haddington but we need the whole road to be upgraded and
turned into a dual carriage-way.
''People are confused when they go from dual to single carriageway on
the road and every avenue must be explored to make them cut their
speed.''
Figures show there have been 117 accidents resulting in 44 fatalities
or serious casualties which required overnight hospital treatment on the
stretch from Dunbar to Edinburgh over a three-year period from 1992.

POLICE have been called in to investigate the travel expenses claims
of a West Lothian district councillor who yesterday was forced to
resign.
Labour representative Terry Coleman, 50, claimed #10,457 in expenses
to and from his home in South Shields on Tyneside to the district.
He was also entitled to back payments of #6115, making a total of
#16,572 over a 10-month period. The #6115 back payment has not been paid
out to Councillor Coleman.
Lothian and Borders police last night confirmed they had been invited
by the council to look into allegations regarding expenses claims
involving one councillor.
Two fraud squad officers removed documents from the district council
headquarters in Bathgate on Monday around midday.
At the same time three senior West Lothian Labour Party members met
Councillor Coleman at his Tyneside home.
Local Labour group leader Councillor Graeme Morrice said that during a
two-hour discussion they had advised Mr Coleman to resign as
representative for the Howden ward in Livingston and he had agreed.
Mr Morrice said: ''We cannot comment upon the detail of Terry
Coleman's record in claiming expenses -- we do not want to prejudice a
police inquiry.
''We recognise that expense claims are the legal responsibility of the
claimant. West Lothian Labour Party will assist the police and will be
conducting its own inquiry.''
Councillor Coleman moved to Tyneside because of his personal
circumstances. His wife Jenny has a heart condition and they wanted to
move nearer her family. The couple have two grown-up daughters.
His friend, West Lothian Labour councillor Joe Thomas said he felt Mr
Coleman had been under great stress and was on the verge of a nervous
breakdown.
Mr Morrice said he had been close to tears after seeing the condition
of Mr Coleman. He went on to accuse rival parties of taking advantage of
a human tragedy to play politics.
He said Mr Coleman had intended to resign after the unitary elections
in April. Adverse publicity surrounding the expenses claims had
persuaded him to bring forward his resignation. His written resignation
was lodged with the council yesterday.
In a short written statement Mr Coleman said: ''I have attempted to
fulfil my commitment to the council and my family to the best of my
ability, without knowingly committing any illegal or corrupt act. I
plead for some human understanding of my family position.''
It is unclear whether Mr Coleman, who claimed mileage allowance, owns
a car or even has a driving licence. Even if he did not he could still
claim a mileage allowance for friends driving him to and from his home
to the council.
Labour's local election campaign co-ordinator Councillor Tony Kinder
accused the minority Scottish National Party administration of ''running
a loose ship'' and called for tighter financial and audit controls.
''For a period of 10 months somebody has been submitting a travel
expenses claim amounting to nearly #100 a day,'' Mr Kinder said.
However, council convener Jimmy McGinley accused the Labour Party of
''trying to put up a smokescreen'' over the expenses claim issue.
Mr McGinley, an SNP councillor, said he had ''been badly let down'' by
Mr Coleman.
Mr McGinley said his understanding was that Mr Coleman would be
staying with his daughter in Livingston during the week and travelling
back to South Shields at weekends.
He added it was ''obnoxious and obscene'' for the Labour Party to try
to criticise the council over its financial checks and controls.
''Never at any time have I made this a political issue. I neither
chose the issue or the timing of it,'' he added.
A Lothian and Borders police spokesman last night confirmed they were
involved in an investigation.
The spokesman said: ''We can confirm that Lothian and Borders police
have been invited by West Lothian District Council to inquire into
allegations regarding expenses claims.''
A political row has already erupted over Councillor Coleman's council
seat. The Labour Party wants one of its number to take it over until the
district councils are wound up. The SNP is expected to suggest its
candidate who came second at the last district elections by only five
votes behind Councillor Coleman should take over.
Before Councillor Coleman's resignation Labour had 11 seats, the SNP
10, Conservatives one and there was one Independent Conservative and one
Independent.
Councillor Coleman had represented Howden for 15 years.
At various times during his political career he had been chairman of
the licensing board, general purposes and finance committee. Latterly he
had been working as a licensing consultant giving aid and advice to pubs
and clubs on local authority regulations.

TORY Party chairman Jeremy Hanley continued his attack on Labour's
local government record yesterday by accusing Shadow Environment
Secretary Frank Dobson of a ''clanger'' for dismissing the Tory campaign
against allegations of corruption in Monklands as ''sectarian''.
Mr Hanley repeated allegations that the council had spent more money
on mainly Roman Catholic Coatbridge than on mainly Protestant Airdrie.
''The allegations were originally raised by Labour councillors and
reported widely in the Scottish press,'' he said.
Labour and the Tories have been exchanging accusations on their local
government records as part of the English local elections campaign. Mr
Hanley said: ''Mr Dobson should stop trying to defend the indefensible.
Labour's record of waste and incompetence in local government is
appalling.''

LABOUR yesterday launched what it billed as the biggest ever political
campaign outside a General Election.
The Rolling Rose will invite people literally to jump on the political
bandwagon as its campaign trailer, plus rock band and assorted
celebrities, tours the country over the next eight months.
It was launched yesterday in London, with Richard Wilson --
television's Victor Meldrew -- as guest compere.
Party leader Tony Blair told MPs and journalists -- ferried to the
scene by boat from Westminster -- and passers-by: ''Rolling Rose will
take our message of hope, change and opportunity to every part of
Britain.
''It represents not just fun and razzmatazz, though there is nothing
wrong with that.
''It is also part of the biggest political eduation campaign ever
undertaken by a political party. I believe it will be one of our most
successful and exciting political campaigns.''
The tour's 150 events include evening shows combining political
comment and debate with comedy, satire and music.

ANY faint notion that commercial television is dominated by men in
suits was dispelled yesterday by ITV's #158m spring and summer schedule,
which had more the whiff of perfume than after-shave about it. Women
writers, women actors, women presenters, and women journalists dominate
in both drama and factual programmes.
Network director Mr Marcus Plantin said: ''All four of our new dramas
have strong female lead characters and three of them have also been
written by top female writers.''
New comedies also featured strong roles for women and several
documentaries have women producers and presenters, he added.
Leading the drama package is Helen Mirren as the newly-promoted
Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison in three new Prime Suspect
stories. The prolific screenwriter Lynda La Plante has penned a new
series, The Governor, which will star Janet McTeer as the new boss of a
tough male prison.
Period drama is supplied by Bramwell, written by Lucy Gannon and
starring Jemma Redgrave as a pioneering nineteenth century doctor.
Dangerous Lady is a hard-hitting 1960s London gangland epic, based on a
novel by Martina Cole and starring Sheila Hancock and Susan Lynch.
Women, however, do not have it all their own way. Jack Shepherd and
Martin Shaw return in, respectively, Wycliffe and The Chief.
After a long absence, Carla Lane, creator of Butterflies and The Liver
Birds, returns to form with a new comedy series (her first for ITV)
called Searching, starring Prunella Scales as the head of a women's
therapy centre.
Women were so much to the fore in yesterday's announcement that the
only time Mr Plantin could get remotely macho was when he hailed ITV's
success in gaining exclusive coverage of the 1995 rugby World Cup in
South Africa.
The centrepiece of VE Day celebrations in May will be live coverage of
the Royal Gala at the London Coliseum, in the presence of the Prince of
Wales. Other factual programmes include a three-part documentary on the
Churchills from the stable that produced The Kennedys and The Windsors.

TORY aspirations in the new South Ayrshire local authority have
suffered a setback with the withdrawal of one of the party's most
accomplished councillors. The deputy leader of Kyle and Carrick District
Council, Mr Murray Tosh, has withdrawn his candidacy for the Troon West
ward amid fears of a conflict with his post as a teacher at Belmont
Academy in Ayr.
Under local government legislation he would not be permitted to be
employed by an authority on which he serves and South Ayrshire will take
responsibility for local schools after April 1996.
Councillor Tosh has represented the people of Troon for seven years
and has been recognised as the leading strategist in the often
controversial stewardship of Kyle and Carrick.
He had understood that it would be acceptable to serve in the shadow
authority for a year before the creation of South Ayrshire but has been
advised that there could be a problem in that there is a 12-month
moratorium on serving councillors who wish to apply for jobs with an
authority.
He said: ''I withdrew from the race with great regret but I was not in
a position to risk my career and the welfare of my family.''

Diyarbakir, Tuesday
TURKISH planes pounded Kurdish rebel camps along a 185-mile front
inside north Iraq today for a second day and ground forces advanced in
pursuit of separatist guerrillas, the army said.
An Iraqi opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress (INC), said in
a statement that Turkish paratroopers had dropped on villages 15 miles
northeast of Dohuk in the east of the region,
But a tank advance towards the district of Shiranish, northeast of the
Iraqi border town of Zakho, had met heavy resistence from Kurdish
guerrillas, it said.
Turkey's general staff spokesman Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu told a
briefing in Diyarbakir, command centre for the operation involving upto
35,000 troops, that at least 24 members of the Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK) had been killed. Eight soldiers were also dead.
The colonel's casualty figure contrasted sharply with one of 200 PKK
rebels being killed, with no Turkish casualties, given earlier today by
Defence Minister Mehmet Golhan.
''The aim is to cause as much destruction as possible,'' said one
military official, summing up the operation which started before dawn
yesterday.
First Turkish television pictures showed soldiers in north Iraq
deployed on steep hilltops, their guns and rocket launchers pointing
towards an empty horizon. Snow lay in some parts, with troops snaking
their way through it in long lines.
President Suleyman Demirel told television that Turkey was
''absolutely determined to eliminate this major provocation. It has the
power and strength to do this.'' He dismissed criticism that the
incursion violated international law.
In Silopi, near the Iraqi border, the mission commander told reporters
his men had secured a swathe of Iraqi territory 185 miles wide and more
than 20 miles deep.
In Geneva, the United Nations expressed concern about Kurdish
refugees, saying it was investigating reports from local authorities
near Zakho that Turkish forces had rounded up Kurds and taken them
forcibly back into Turkey.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE Government and Sinn Fein last night appeared to move closer to
talks involving Ministers.
Sinn Fein has ''responded positively'' to the Government's proposed
agenda for discussions at that level, according to republican sources in
Belfast.
Negotiations between the two sides have been delayed over Government
demands for assurances from Sinn Fein that the IRA is prepared to make
some sort of move on the decommissioning of weapons.
It is understood Sinn Fein's response was delivered yesterday after
talks involving Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness,
leader of the party's delegation for talks with civil servants at
Stormont.
The two sides have not met since February 9, when a meeting was
cancelled because of a bugging scare.
However, they have been in regular contact, and although the
Government's agenda for talks at ministerial level was issued a few days
ago, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew has made it clear
that did not mean his side was ready for dialogue to begin immediately.
In Belfast on Monday, he said Sinn Fein had yet to give the assurances
on weapons he was he was looking for.
The Northern Ireland Office insisted last night there had been no
change in Government policy about talking with Sinn Fein.
A spokesman said Sir Patrick's demand that the IRA made moves to
decommission its weapons remained Government policy.
A source said nothing had changed, no message had been received from
Sinn Fein and the Government was waiting to hear from the party.
The leader of the non-sectarian Alliance Party in Northern Ireland
said yesterday that President Clinton has pledged to take a hard line on
his demands for the IRA to get rid of its weapons.
Dr John Alderdice said he was given that assurance when he met the
President at the White House on St Patrick's Day.
Meanwhile, SDLP leader John Hume said the rift between the Government
and Sinn Fein over the decommissioning of weapons could be resolved
sensibly as part of the overall Ulster peace process.
Mr Hume warned that the goodwill towards Northern Ireland in the US
and Europe would not remain for ever and the quicker dialogue started
the sooner it could be harnessed into economic benefits.
Deputy Irish Prime Minister Dick Spring said the decommissioning of
terrorist arms had to form part of any lasting settlement to the
Northern Ireland conflict.
He also highlighted ''the extraordinary debt'' owed to President
Clinton, whose controversial White House invitation to Mr Adams last
week opened up a rift in British-American relations.

THE two main Unionist parties in Northern Ireland yesterday were
preparing for a head-to-head fight following the death of MP Sir James
Kilfedder.
The differences between the Ulster Unionist Party of James Molyneaux
and Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party will turn the by-election in
North Down -- expected some time in June -- into a mini-referendum on
Unionist attitudes to the British and Irish framework document on the
future of Northern Ireland.
The result will have an effect on John Major's majority in the House
of Commons.
Sir James, the only Popular Unionist MP, was a strong supporter of the
Government despite loyalist concern about the framework document.
However, if the DUP wins the seat, it will mean one more vote against
Mr Major, while the UUP would support the Government only some of the
time.

AN election manifesto pledge by Edinburgh Conservatives, to examine
the possibility of creating an extra, part-time police force of retired
officers, yesterday ran into stiff opposition from the main police
union, the Scottish Police Federation.
The leader of the Conservative group on Edinburgh District Council,
Councillor Daphne Sleigh, told The Herald that the idea had originally
come from senior police officers, and that she had consulted Sir William
Sutherland, Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders, who had, she said,
expressed willingness to make a study of the idea.
The plan has been put forward in a pamphlet called Blueprint, a local
Tory manifesto for the new unitary authority elections in April.
Mrs Sleigh said yesterday: ''The idea came to us from the police in
the first place. We have had meetings with Sir William and some of his
senior officers, and we looked at the idea of a feasibility study.
''This force would be over and above the existing police strength,
complementing the current force. What we are saying to the public is
that police officers retire in their late 40s or early 50s, which is an
appalling waste of resources.
''We believe there are many police officers who would be pleased to be
retained, who could have another job but return to the beat part-time.''
She adds: ''In an ideal world we would want to see far more police
officers, but who is going to pay? What we would like to see, soon, is a
feasibility study and possibly a pilot scheme to test the idea. It might
be possible to get about eight policemen or women patrolling for the
price of one.''
However, the plan was attacked by Mr Norman MacLeod, secretary of the
Lothian and Borders branch of the Scottish Police Federation, who said:
''This is the first move to try to introduce policing on the cheap.
''This Tory pamphlet has the cheek to say that pious words are not
enough when talking of direct action to quieten peoples' fears about
safety. Then it goes on to suggest a study into what it obliquely calls
a 'retained police force'. In other words, this is one which is
part-time, second class, and inadequately trained.''
The Tories, Mr MacLeod said, had equated a retained police force with
retained firemen.
''Retained firemen are, almost without exception, men with full-time
jobs who can muster when required in areas of low risk and low
population density. Policemen are primarily employed to prevent crime,
not solve it,'' he added.
Deputy Chief Constable Graham Power, of Lothian and Borders police,
said: ''Normally it is not our policy to comment on election material. I
have no knowledge of this proposal being discussed at senior level, and
no arrangements of this kind are currently being discussed.''

Sarajevo, Tuesday
SERBS seized a heavy machine-gun and ammunition from British
peacekeepers in Bosnia today in a fresh blow to hopes of a lasting
peace.
A UN spokesman said a British vehicle was stopped at a Serb checkpoint
outside Sarajevo and its crew forced to give up the gun along with 1000
rounds of ammunition.
The hijack took place in a suburb notorious for acts of banditry
against the UN and followed a growing pattern of harassment -- along
with shelling and sniping in the city -- which was a prelude to fierce
clashes yesterday.-- Reuter.

THE Government last night easily saw off the latest challenge to its
European policy when MPs backed Ministers' stance on agriculture.
Against the background of concern over the Common Agricultural Policy,
MPs voted by 305 to 278, a majority of 27, against a Labour amendment
stating that the CAP continued to fail consumers and that the Government
was not doing enough to change an unacceptable policy.
The Government motion, congratulating Ministers on its ''robust
negotiating stance'' on the CAP and on its ''leading role in achieving
reform of the CAP, was approved by 298 votes to 277, a majority of 21.
The nine unwhipped Tory rebels all abstained in this crucial vote,
except for Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton South-West), who supported
the Government.
In the earlier vote on the Labour amendment, all the rebels supported
the Government, apart from Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East), who
abstained.
Former Chancellor Mr Norman Lamont, a persistent critic of European
policy, backed the Government in both divisions.
Mr Budgen candidly admitted he was supporting his ''former party'' for
''openly political reasons''.
Urging his party to unite before the local elections, he said: ''I do
believe the time for a back bencher to be as much nuisance as possible
to his party is when his party is doing well and is arrogant with
success.
''Now my former party is doing badly, this seems a very proper time
for me to come to the aid of my former colleagues.''
Labour's frustration at the apparent softening of the Tory rebels'
hard line surfaced just before the vote when Opposition spokesman
Elliott Morley called Mr Budgen ''a rat actually jumping back onto a
sinking ship''.
Earlier, opening the debate on agricultural prices and the CAP, Mr
Waldegrave sought to woo the Euro-critics by highlighting the ''huge
shift'' away from mounting EU spending on agriculture -- one of their
main targets for reform.
He also pledged the Government's commitment to ''vigorously sustain''
the battle against fraud.
''As a result of our efforts, the monster has stopped growing. Now he
must start a radical programme of slimming,'' he said.
However, another whipless Tory, Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North)
said: ''The CAP rips off the housewife, plunders the taxpayer and
discriminates against the British farmer.
''Any red-blooded British Government would get out of it and get out
of it now.''
Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow), another Tory Euro-rebel without the
whip, condemned the CAP as ''insanity'' and accused Ministers of
''buying its enemies at the expense of selling its friends'' over the
subsidy regime.
''If the Conservative Party accords greater importance to the
institutions of the EU than to the interests of its natural supporters
in the food and farming industry, then it will get its just desserts,''
he warned.
''We have a situation where a Conservative Government apparently is
prepared to go to the stake for a socialist principle, prepared to turn
its back on its own values and people, so as to keep faith with other
members of what is becoming the world's most expensive club -- buying
its enemies at the expense of selling its friends.''
For the Opposition, Dr Gavin Strang said there had been a significant
rise in farm incomes, which was welcome.
However, contrary to Mr Waldegrave's assertions, spending on the CAP
was still ''racheting up year in, year out''.
It had increased by 180% since 1979, he claimed -- to angry denials
from the Agriculture Minister -- and would amount to #30bn this year.
''Intervention buying and export subsidies should go,'' he said.
Mr Budgen intervened repeatedly, attacking the CAP as ''an utter
nonsense'' and accusing Labour of wanting to spend even more on it.
However, Dr Strang claimed this was merely an attempt by him to
justify his ''failure'' to vote with the Opposition -- despite
Euro-sceptic opposition to the CAP.
Tory Peter Atkinson (Hexham) said he had expected some detailed
proposals from Dr Strang on how Labour would reform the CAP.
However, after Dr Strang's speech, he was ''baffled'' on exactly what
Labour intended.
Mr Atkinson added: ''I believe the Government is right and deserves
congratulation on what it has done to turn this Titanic (of the CAP)
around.''
Tory Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk North) defended the CAP while
acknowledging some changes were necessary.
He derided as ''mischievous'' those who claimed British agriculture
would not need subsidising if the UK pulled out of the CAP.
''On this subject, there is more misinformation put around, especially
by Euro-sceptics,'' he protested.
Winding up the debate for Labour, Mr Morley said there was widespread
recognition of the failures and distortion of the CAP.
He said: ''Our amendment reflects the mood of this House and, indeed,
the mood of the country.''
Mr Morley said he was sorry to hear the arguments put forward by Mr
Budgen on why he would vote with the Government.
To Labour cheers, he told a smiling Mr Budgen: ''It does seem to be
one of the first cases on record of a rat actually jumping back onto a
sinking ship rather than deserting a sinking ship.''
Mr Morley challenged the Tory Euro-rebel to say how he could hold his
head up again when talking about the EU after voting with the Government
and not for Labour's amendment ''which actually stands for what we have
been arguing for and what you have been arguing for publicly''.
He pressed Mr Budgen: ''You are entitled to your own opinion. But you
are not entitled to argue one thing and then vote another way.''
Winding up for the Government, Agriculture Minister Michael Jack
warned the Euro-rebels: ''The problem for some on this side is of the
House is perhaps a temptation to give some credibility to the Opposition
amendment.''
However, he said anybody reading ''this diet which stands for an
Opposition policy on agriculture'' would see it was the Government that
was truly addressing the question of reform and the need to modify the
CAP in the interests of the UK food industry, consumers and farmers.
He insisted: ''We have the credible policies.''

EDINBURGH Conservatives yesterday claimed the Labour Party was so
arrogant about the result of the local elections that they had already
decided who would fill which top post in the new city council.
The job of Lord Provost was apparently to go to Lothian Region
convener Eric Milligan, and regional Labour leader Keith Geddes was to
lead a new city administation.
However, senior Tories said Labour, which currently controls Lothian
region and Edinburgh district councils, would face some surprises at the
polls on April 6.
Launching their local manifesto, the Tories also targeted Labour's
controversial transport policies in the city. They promised to scrap
many of Labour's road-narrowing schemes and to provide proper car parks
which would encourage people to visit the city centre.
On cutting crime, they promised to investigate the possibility of
introducing a part-time ''retained police force'' in addition to
existing officers which would be similar to that operating in the fire
service and which, it was claimed, would put more bobbies on the beat.
Tory group leader Councillor Daphne Sleigh said: ''Whether it is
anti-crime cameras in local shopping areas or in neighbourhoods or tough
measures to crack down on pavement fouling and littering, we will
introduce a new and improved service at a price people can afford.''

Tokyo, Wednesday
JAPANESE police today raided buildings of a secretive religious sect
linked by some media reports to nerve gas attacks that killed eight
people and injured close to 5000 on Tokyo's subways.
Police said the raids were mounted by 3000 officers on charges that
sect members abducted a Tokyo city employee last month.
The sect issued a statement yesterday, denying allegations both of the
abduction and Monday's poison attack using sarin, a gas developed by
German scientists in the Second World War, which cripples the nervous
system and can kill in minutes.
Police said the raids targeted four building complexes owned by the
shadowy cult Aum Shinri Kyo.
Nobody has claimed responsibility over the poison gas attack, which
the government called indiscriminate murder.
Today's police raid was not directly connected to the attack.
The charge stemmed from the abduction of 69-year-old Kiyoshi Kariya,
last seen on February 28 being pushed into a van by four people from a
Tokyo street.
At the time, Kariya's younger sister was trying to break from the
secretive cult, after pledging donations of the family land and cash.
The raids took place on two building complexes in Tokyo, another in
the small village of Kamiku-Isshiki west of the capital and the sect's
headquarters in Fujinomiya at the foot of Mount Fuji.
At the Kamiku-Isshiki village last July police detected traces of
sarin used in Monday's attacks on five subway trains during morning rush
hour.
The incident at the village did not amount to a criminal case, because
no one was poisoned. But the National Police Agency's science squad
found traces of a by-product of sarin production at the scene.
In the Tokyo complex at the posh Tokyo neighbourhood of Minami Aoyama,
riot police wearing helmets arrived on the scene around 6am and showed
search warrants to Aum Shinri Kyo officials.
Sect officials refused police entry and scene developed into a
quarrel. Some police eventually entered the building.
Yesterday's statement by Aum Shinri Kyo, a secretive cult built around
bearded guru Shoko Asahara, blamed the government for trying to frame
it.
''Some media reports have linked our sect to the Tokyo sarin case,''
said a statement issued by Aum Shinri Kyo's headquarters in Fujinomiya
city.
''To create an impression that the Aum Shinri Kyo was a group that
would carry out inhuman acts, we think state authorities planned this
conspiracy,'' the statement said.
The religious group was founded in 1987 by Shoko Asahara, who has
claimed he can levitate himself. The sect's followers, who leave their
families for communal living, is reputed to number about 10,000
throughout Japan.
Asahara has claimed the world will end in 1997. He made headlines in
1990 when he and 25 followers stood as candidates for election to
parliament's Lower House. None won seats.
Police focused their investigation on scores of eyewitnesses who saw
people leaving the gas on packed commuter trains and on two cases last
year involving the same gas.
They said last night that they still had no clear suspects or motives
for yesterday's attacks.
They were, however, waiting to question one survivor, a man seen
kicking a gas container on to a subway platform.
Tokyo police said 120 eyewitnesses had reported seeing
suspicious-looking characters on the subway during yesterday's rush
hour.
TBS television said these included at least one report pinpointing the
man now under surveillance in hospital.
The man, in his thirties, was seen kicking a container wrapped in a
newspaper out of a subway car at Kodenmacho station.
He tried to get away but succumbed to the gas himself and collapsed on
the platform, the network said. - REUTER

PLANS by Greater Glasgow Health Board to close care facilities for the
elderly at Lenzie and Mearnskirk Hospitals were reversed yesterday after
successful public campaigns. The existing hospital at Mearnskirk will go
but the board, in approving the final draft of their community-care plan
for the elderly, agreed to retain 60 beds in the Eastwood area, in a new
building at Mearnskirk.
Instead of closing Lenzie Hospital, the board is to close 60
continuing care of the elderly beds in Stobhill Hospital. Also retained
are 10 beds at Newark Lodge, serving the elderly in the Jewish
community.

THE Scottish Liberal Democrats' oldest candidate in next month's local
elections alleged yesterday that she had been subjected to a torrent of
telephone and verbal abuse by local Conservative opponents in Eastwood.
Seventy-five-year-old Miss Ella Rae, who lives in Newton Mearns and is
known as a fiery local campaigner, said she was going public for the
first time after suffering repeated dirty tricks campaigns which had led
her to change her telephone number three times and eventually go
ex-directory.
At the last local election, Miss Rae said she had had to bring in
Strathclyde police and the British Telecom abuse line to monitor her
incoming calls.
Miss Rae said the telephone abuse had not been confined to the
election campaigns that she had fought over the past 20 years, both as a
Liberal and Liberal Democrat candidate.
She said she had been a leading campaigner against Pilmuir Quarry and
had accused Tory-controlled Eastwood District Council of failing to win
an environmental impact study and back the people strongly enough in
their fight.
She said: ''The result was that one day someone phoned me and started
a chainsaw at the other end of the phone. It was the people who wanted
the quarry to go ahead. They were young Tories and said 'this is what is
going to happen to you'. I knew it was them but could not prove it.
''On another occasion, someone said they were going to knee-cap my
son.''
Her ex-directory number had come back into the public domain after she
declared her candidacy for the new Greenfarm ward in East Renfrewshire
in next month's unitary elections. The new ward is a three-corner fight
among the Tories, SNP, and the Scottish Liberal Democrats.
She said: ''I have taken 17 abusive calls since my name went down for
Greenfarm. One caller told me that I didn't have a snowball's chance in
hell of winning.''
Miss Rae said she had no doubt that it was the Conservatives who were
behind the campaign. In some cases, she had even recognised who was
speaking but could not prove it.
''It's got to the stage this time in Eastwood that the Tories must get
rid of me. I believe I could win the seat. If I win they have had it as
far as East Renfrewshire is concerned.
''Labour, SNP, and the police will tell you it is only me that gets
belittled.''
Miss Rae alleged she was also the subject of character assassination
by her Conservative opponents. ''This unitary election is handing out
gutter sleaze against me because I have the audacity to contest a Tory
stronghold.''
Miss Rae said this was likely to be her last election. She had a heart
condition and had recently undergone abdominal surgery.
An SLD spokesman, who described Miss Rae as a party stalwart, said:
''These allegations are very serious and we hope police will investigate
them fully.''
The Tory group leader on Eastwood District Council, Mr Gordon
Macdonald, said: ''I have no knowledge of this and would refrain from
commenting on it.''
Tory councillor Leslie Rosin, the provost of Eastwood and an old
sparring partner of Miss Rae, said last night: ''I can't comment on what
someone else has done. I have no knowledge of the phone calls.''

THE Scottish Labour Party has launched a 10-point action plan to
regenerate rural communities which Labour-controlled councils will put
into operation following next month's elections.
The party, which has a record 230 candidates standing in rural areas
at the elections, claimed yesterday that its values of ''strong
community, good public services, and clean environment'' were in tune
with the needs and wishes of Scotland's rural communities.
It said the action plan would help regenerate rural economies by
improving infrastructure and encouraging an affordable, comprehensive
system of public transport.
A jobs creation and training plan will be drawn up in consultation
with local people aimed at creating jobs ''rooted in the community''.
Ms Rhona Brankin, chairwoman of the Scottish Labour Party, said
yesterday: ''Scottish Labour is increasingly the party of rural
Scotland. Rural communities are dynamic and to survive must constantly
develop and adapt to changing economic circumstances. Labour will ensure
that the people who live in rural Scotland are determining rather than
being swept away by initiatives.''
She added: ''Rural services have suffered in the last 16 years under a
Government which refuses to sustain village life.''
The party states that joblessness in rural areas has increased by more
than 30% since the last recession began, that 65% of rural households in
Scotland have incomes below the #200 low-pay threshold, and that crime
in rural areas has increased by 57% since 1979.

A LEADING UK helicopter engineering company is to invest more than #1m
in a purpose-built corporate headquarters and servicing facility which
will create 30 jobs in Aberdeen.
Maintenance, including the repair and overhaul of hydraulic components
and main rotor blades and the inspection, modification, and repair of
safety equipment, will be carried out by Rotortech at its new 25,000sq
ft premises at Kirkhill, adjacent to Aberdeen Airport.
Some management and administration functions will also be transfered
to Kirkhill from the existing base at Bourn Airfield in Cambridge.
''This move to Aberdeen will place us at the hub of European oil and
gas operations and we believe will enable us to access work which we
have not previously been able to obtain because of our existing
geographical location,'' said Mr John Cloggie, company managing
director.
He said he believed by moving to Aberdeen the company would be able to
help UK and Scandinavian helicopter operators reduce their direct
maintenance costs.
''In addition, our Kirkhill facility will bring potential economies of
scale through providing helicopter operators with a viable alternative
to maintaining in-house resources to carry out these activities.''
The Kirkhill facility is expected to be fully operational by late
summer.

THE deputy governor of the Bank of England resigned yesterday,
expressing fears of tabloid intrusion harming the public sector, and
admitting he had made ''foolish mistakes'' over an affair.
In his letter of resignation to Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, 47-year-old
Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea said he decided to quit his #180,000-a-year post
to avoid the Bank being damaged.
His former mistress, American-born Mary Ellen Synon, commented: ''If
you're going to dump, don't dump a financial journalist if you're deputy
governor of the Bank of England. That's dumb.''
In his resignation letter to Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Mr Pennant-Rea
said he was resigning ''with great regret'' to avoid the possibility of
the Bank ''being damaged by some foolish mistakes that I made, albeit
more than a year ago''.
He explained that one of his reasons for taking the job was his belief
that Britain ''would benefit from greater job mobility between the
private and public sectors''.
His letter went on: ''But I do know that many good people in the
commercial world are put off by the tabloid intrusion into the private
lives of those in public positions. After the events of the past few
days, this reluctance to move will increase.''
In reply, Mr Clarke wrote: ''You have done an exceptional job as
deputy governor. I am particularly grateful for the hard and effective
work that you put into the Barings crisis.
''I am sorry that you feel that tabloid intrusion is increasingly
discouraging the movement of good people from the commercial world to
the public sector. I would view this with great regret.''
The Bank of England Governor, Mr Eddie George, said he understood the
reasons and ''greatly respected'' his determination to minimise any
damage to the Bank.
Mr Pennant-Rea's dramatic resignation came two days after 44-year-old
Ms Synon revealed details of their affair in the press. She told how the
couple had made love on the carpet of Mr George's dressing room at the
Bank.
His wife Helen, speaking in the doorstep of the couple's home, said
she ''respected and supported'' her husband's decision.
Mr Pennant-Rea, who was born in Rhodesia, worked for the General and
Municipal Workers Union for a time before joining the Bank of England as
an economist in the 70s. He became editor of The Economist in 1986
before returning to the Bank as deputy governor in 1993.
Mr George said in a statement: ''I understand the reasons for his
decision and greatly respect his determination to minimise and damage to
the Bank. It is a matter of deep personal regret to me that Rupert has
felt it necessary to resign.''
Mrs Pennant-Rea, 49, read a prepared statement on the doorstep of the
couple's #500,000 home in Parsons Green, west London. She made it plain
what she thought of Ms Synon, accusing the former mistress of holding
over her family the threat of exposure for 12 months.
''I support and respect my husband's decision to resign from the
Bank,'' she said. ''Over the last year, despite her threat to publicise
the affair, we have endeavoured to rebuild our marriage and protect all
our children. Throughout this time, Rupert has paid a very high price
for taking the right decision and staying with us.''
She had known about the affair ever since it ended a year ago, she
said.
There was no bitterness towards her husband in the statement although
she also failed to use the word ''forgive'' at any point.
With her lawyer by her side, Mrs Pennant-Rea added: ''Despite the
obvious desire to correct the many hurtful falsehoods that have been
printed in the press since Sunday, neither Rupert nor I will be saying
anything further.''
For three days, Mrs Pennant-Rea had coped with reporters camped
outside the family's home while the newspapers printed details of the
affair. But she chatted pleasantly and at times frankly with them.
She even re-emerged later from the house and began talking both with
well-wishing neighbours and the remaining reporters -- thanking the
journalists for the way they behaved.
Mrs Pennant-Rea was a divorcee when she first met her husband, who was
then married to his second wife. She had his son Edward in 1986 two
months after they married following his divorce from his second wife.
Both already had two children of their own.
Mr Pennant-Rea and Ms Synon were fellow students at Trinity College,
Dublin in the late 60s. They met again in 1991 when he was editing The
Economist and she was its Irish correspondent, working as a freelance.
She no longer works for the magazine.
She let him know she was visiting London for her 41st birthday, they
met for lunch and the affair began.
''I allowed myself to think we might have a future together: after
all, he had left two previous wives,'' she said yesterday.
Ms Synon said the affair continued after he joined the Bank of
England, with the convenience of the official car and even told of
trysts in the Bank itself.
She joked to a friend that she was well qualified to write a guide
book called Ceilings of the Bank of England.
She said he became sensitive to the new risks to his career, and grew
emotionally distant and reluctant for them to be seen together.
Eventually, he broke off the affair.
Ms Synon said her view of the matter was was that he had ''turned
vicious and extremely nasty'', and from that moment she hardened her own
stance.
''I said: 'That's it, matey, no more protection from me. You've had
it, and that's it','' she recalled.
''If he had even been vaguely nice about this, I would probably have
cooled off in 20 minutes. But the fact that he was kind of deadly and
vicious about it just made me very angry.''
A Downing Street spokesman said the Government would be involved in
discussions over Mr Pennant-Rea's successor and the replacement would be
announced by No 10.

<HEADLINE>Raid was 'to pay for funeral'</HEADLINE>

TWO drug addicts who robbed a post office at knifepoint in a bid to
provide a funeral for a fellow addict were each jailed at the High Court
in Edinburgh yesterday for seven years.
David Carlin, 32, of Niddrie House Park, and Robert Ramsay, 28, of
Bingham Way, both Edinburgh, admitted that, on February 3 this year,
they assaulted sub-postmaster Andrew Gilhooley, and robbed him of
#11,618.
During the raid at the sub post office at Niddrie Mains Road,
Edinburgh, they seized hold of Mr Gilhooley, held him against a wall,
put a knife to his throat, and threatened to stab him.
The court heard that, the day before the robbery, Ramsay had learned
that his sister, who was heavily involved in drugs, had died in
hospital.
Ramsay was deeply distressed and realising that he had no money to
help pay for her funeral had enlisted the help of Carlin to carry out
the crime.
Advocate-depute Iain Bonomy, QC, said Mr Gilhooley had been putting
cash in a safe.
He was pushed up against a wall and Ramsay held a knife to his throat,
while Carlin began taking money from the safe.
Mr Gilhooley tried to grab his attacker's hand but Ramsay broke his
grip and put the knife above the sub postmaster's head and threatened to
stab him.
The two robbers escaped with the cash but the area sealed off by
police and they were caught near a railway line. The money was
recovered.
The court heard that both men had lengthy criminal records, with
Carlin having 63 previous convictions and Ramsay having 45 previous
convictions.
Solicitor-advocate Vincent Belmonte, who appeared for both men, said
their past crimes were largely committed to fund their severe drug
addiction.
He added that, as a result of their addiction, both Carlin and Ramsay
have become very seriously ill and their life expectancy has been
restricted.
He said: ''Any substantial prison sentence which may be imposed may
well result in it being a life sentence for them.''

SHETLAND's roads and transport committee yesterday rejected four of
five proposed new traffic orders, after hearing that local residents
objected to further restrictions in Lerwick.
Sergeant John Mathewson had explained that the orders were necessary
because of illegal parking in Shetland's congested capital, causing
obstructions and dangers.
He also said he believed there were some yellow lines in the town
which ran slightly beyond the area covered by existing orders.
The committee, meeting to discuss the restrictions on parking at busy
junctions in the town, approved a ban at the junction of Hillhead and
Scalloway Road.
Councillor Willie Tait told the committee the council was to blame for
the problem, because its office staff used the streets to park.

WAR hero and clan chief Lord Lovat was buried yesterday at Eskadale on
the slopes above the Beauly River, Fraser country for more than 600
years and where generations of the family lie.
Simon Fraser, the 24th Lovat chief, MacShimi, died last Thursday at
the age of 83. The first of 500 mourners began arriving at the
white-washed St Mary's RC Church at Eskadale more than an
hour-and-a-half before the requiem Mass was due to begin.
Wreaths at St Mary's entrance reflected the different strands to his
life. They came from his close family; from the Clan Fraser in Canada,
in California, in England; from ''Ville de Ouistreham A Son
Liberateur''; from the pipe band in Dubright, Normandy; from the 78th
Fraser Highlanders, Capistrana Branch; from Beauly Shinty Club; from the
Mallaig and Morar Games Club.
Old commandos in their green berets rubbed shoulders with Highland
aristocracy, the chief of the MacKenzies the Earl of Cromartie, Sir
Donald Cameron of Lochiel. They joined local people and other friends to
hear Bishop Mario Conti of Aberdeen, who conducted the service.
''We have come to bury our brother and friend Shimi, Lord Lovat. His
long life was one of great distinction. Born into privilege, he lived to
serve his country, his Highland community, his Church.
''He was a brave and gentle warrior whose deeds of daring were
honoured by military awards and whose exploits are now legendary. He was
a highly intelligent man, well educated, cultured, with a deep interest
in the political and social life of his people. Yet an essentially
humble man. He was a man of deep but unostentatious faith,
characteristically loyal to his friends and to God.
''He epitomised all that was noble in his line and best in the world
of privilege he inherited. A clan chief by right and by temperament, a
Highland gentleman by training and by instinct, a devout Christian by
education and by conviction.''
The new Lord Lovat, the 18-year-old Harrow student, Simon Fraser, read
from Isaiah:
''On this mountain, the Lord of hosts will prepare for all peoples a
banquet of rich foods. On this mountain he will remove the mourning veil
covering all peoples, and the shroud enwrapping all nations. He will
destroy Death forever . . .''
Another to pay tribute was Sir Fitzroy Maclean, a war hero himself and
Lord Lovat's brother-in-law. He broke down when he recalled Lord Lovat's
final hours last week, a year to the day since the Lovat's youngest son
Andrew, 42, was killed in Tanzania by a wounded buffalo.
''He died on the anniversary of Andrew's death, gently with his wife's
arms around him. Rosie's arms had always been around him in the 57 years
of their marriage. He was much loved and will be much missed by his many
friends. A great chief of a great clan.''
Sir Fitzroy also recalled Lord Lovat's wartime career: ''Just as his
father saw in 1900 that the Lovat Scouts were what was needed in South
Africa, Shimi quickly grasped that commandos were what were needed in
1940.
''He raised them, he trained them, and he led them in battle. As one
military historian has put it 'for his rank, he probably had the best
and clearest military mind on either side in the Second World War'.
''The Germans were undoubtedly quite right to offer a prize for his
capture dead or alive.''
Former commando Niall Thomson from Aberdeen, who now lives in Tain,
was at the Normandy landings with Lord Lovat and was at Eskadale
yesterday. ''The great guy has gone. Superb leader, always led from the
front. He never asked anybody to do anything he couldn't do himself.''
Following the service, with his son Kim playing the pipes, Lord Lovat
was carried the few yards to the family's burial ground, where his sons
Andrew and then Simon, 54, have lain for just a year.

A CAMPAIGN similar to the successful ''Hands Off Hibs'' five years ago
looks set to be launched this week in a bid to save the greyhound track
at Powderhall Stadium.
Yesterday, it was announced that, after 70 years, there would no
longer be greyhound racing at the stadium.
While the Edinburgh Monarchs speedway team has been told by the new
owners of the venue that it can continue at the track for the
forthcoming season, starting next week, its future racing plans have
been thrown into doubt.
The announcement about Powderhall, where Sunday racing was introduced
earlier this year, came in a statement from the recently-appointed joint
receivers. It said the sale of the stadium had now been completed in a
deal valued at #3.3m.
They said they had reached agreement with the new owners -- a
newly-formed subsidiary of English property company Charlotte Twenty-One
Ltd.
''Greyhound racing, which had terminated as a result of owners
withdrawing their dogs before the new owners agreed to purchase the
property, will not be resumed.''
Last night, the Powderhall Greyhound Owners Association vowed to fight
the move and said it would be meeting tomorrow night to launch a
campaign. They would be trying to get support from the local
authorities.
Mr David Welsh, the group's chairman, forecast that a campaign would
have similarities to the ''Hands Off Hibs'' lobby, when Hearts financed
the offer for Hibs shares by means of a bank facility, provided by the
Bank of Scotland, whose customers included a number of Easter Road
supporters.
Until recently, the same bank had a shareholding in Charlotte
Twenty-One. Last night, when questioned about its sharholding, a
spokeswoman said the bank no longer had a stake in it.
She said: ''Because of customer confidence, we can't comment any
further.''
Mr Matt Henderson and his partner, Mr Cameron Russell, of chartered
accountants Kidsons Impey, were appointed joint receivers last month to
the Powderhall operating company Scottish Greyhound Racing Company Ltd,
headed by Mr Eddie Ramsay, an Edinburgh businessman.
Mr Ramsay had been in negotiations with brewers Bass Leisure over
#1.8m the company claimed he owed it.
Last night, Mrs Jane Glass, an owner and trainer, described the
announcement as sad and said that the public, as well as those involved
in dog racing, had lost out.
The joint receivers said the amount received in the sale package
''should enable a dividend to become payable to the ordinary creditors
after selling secured and preferential claims''.
A spokesman for Edinburgh Monarchs described the developments as
worrying.
He said they were examining the feasibility of a move to the Ingliston
Showground.
Yesterday, Mr Ramsay was not at home.

a ''contemporary relic'' of a bygone age. Lord Gill criticised the
complacency and apparent indifference of the legal profession towards
the complexity, cost and inefficiency of a system which he said was
failing the public it was supposed to serve.
He urged the judiciary and lawyers to take a lead in promoting reform,
before change was forced by public resentment.

ANGRY scenes erupted in court yesterday when bus driver Campbell
Devlin, 30, was cleared of causing the deaths of three Girl Guides and
two of their leaders in the West Street bus crash.
Relatives of the girls gasped in shock, then sobbed. Some relatives
yelled abuse from the public benches. Others reduced women in the jury
to tears as they shouted and swore at them and screamed: ''These mothers
will never sleep again.''
Amid emotional scenes outside Glasgow Sheriff Court, furious relatives
complained about the ''outrageous'' verdict.
Devlin, of Rannoch Street, Cathcart, Glasgow, had been found not
guilty of causing the five deaths, and 15 injuries, six of them serious,
by driving a double-decker bus dangerously on September 18 last year.
He sat unflinching in the dock as the torrent of abuse was shouted
within feet after a five-day trial the jury of nine men and six women at
Glasgow Sheriff Court found Devlin guilty of the lesser charge of
careless driving.
Devlin sat head bowed in the dock as police ringed the courtroom and
helped sobbing relatives, several on the point of collapse, outside.
Sheriff Archibald Bell said he sympathised with the feelings of
relatives but warned them he would have to clear the court unless there
was order.
Women jurors sat sobbing with their heads in their hands. One mother
collapsed shaking uncontrollably and had to be half-carried to the
court's first-aid room for assitance.
Sheriff Bell, who was told that Devlin was a first offender, deferred
sentence for three weeks for social inquiry and community service
reports and continued bail.
Even Mr David Burns QC, defending Devlin, was not immune to the wrath
of the bereaved families. They swore at him as he walked from the court.
Outside, George Riddick, whose daughter Margaret-Ann, 11, died in the
crash, said: ''The driver should never have gone down that road.''
Another relative, Andrew Dougal, 59, whose wife, Robina, 47, a Guide
leader, died, said: ''We were warned that he could walk away from the
major charge. I have lost half of myself because of what happened.''
A mother whose 11-year-old daughter was injured stormed: ''This is
rubbish justice. We are heartbroken.''
During the trial the court heard that Devlin, who had been driving
buses only since April that year, was taking the Girl Guides of the 313
and 313a Companies and their leaders from Drumchapel, Glasgow, to
Butlin's at Ayr and back.
He was unsure of the route and was guided out of Drumchapel by a Guide
leader, Mrs Mima Dunlop, 44, of Gorsewood, Bishopbriggs.
On the way home Mrs Dunlop was asked to guide the driver from
Glasgow's South Side and went ahead in her car.
She drove into West Street then turned and saw what she thought was an
open-topped bus.
But it was Devlin's bus, with its roof ripped off.
What happened next was described as ''carnage followed by an eerie
silence''.
Dead and dying were Guide leaders Mrs Robina Dougall, 47, of Boon
Drive, Mrs Mary McGreskin, 39, of Drummore Road, and Guides Catherine
McKnight, 10, of Pitmilly Road, Margaret-Ann Riddick, 11, of Bankglen
Road, and Laura Cullen, 10, of Bellsyde Avenue, all Drumchapel, Glasgow.
The court was told that the children had been singing and joking after
a wonderful day out when tragedy struck.
Driver Devlin was deeply shocked and sobbed throughout the trial.
Witnesses told how in the previous four years there had been 37
instances of high vehicles striking the same low bridge or getting stuck
underneath it.
Despite complaints the region did nothing about the bridge because
there had been no injuries for more than four years and it thought the
signs were adequate.
Since the tragedy, despite new mandatory warning signs on the approach
to the bridge, there have been another seven incidents of what is now
known as ''bridge bashing''.
Earlier Miss Elizabeth Munro, prosecuting, asked the jury not to
compromise by bringing in the lesser verdict of careless driving.
She asked them not to consider Devlin's obvious suffering, but to
leave that to the sheriff on passing sentence.
Miss Munro also asked the jury to be dispassionate and not to say to
themselves: ''There but for the grace of God go I.''
She said the jury had heard ''an unfolding human tragedy on a huge and
ghastly scale''.
Miss Munro added: ''What started out as a happy, noisy, Sunday day
trip ended up in bloody carnage in West Street.''
Giving evidence Devlin had told the court: ''I was following the car
and did not see any signs. My mind was on other things.'' Asked why he
was crying he replied: ''What I have done to the families.''
Strathclyde Regional Council's chair of roads and transportation said
after the court verdict that the tragedy had shocked him and many people
in Drumchapel and beyond.
Councillor Charlie Gordon said: ''It also deeply affected many
regional council staff who dealt with the immediate and longer-term
effects of the accident.''
He added that the council wished to stress again that the signs at the
West Street bridge were adequate before the accident occurred and said
that ''no double-deck bus should have been using the route''.
A spokesman for Clydeside 2000, which employs Devlin and placed him on
suspension of duties immediately after the accident, said he would
remain suspended ''until the company is able to consider his position''.
A decision is likely to be taken within the next few days.
It is expected that a fatal accident inquiry will be held later this
year, while the matter could also be contested in the civil courts.
Clydeside 2000 has received a number of civil claims in connection
with the accident and have passed these on to its insurers.

THE famous Henry Moore sculpture King and Queen, which was beheaded by
vandals, is to be repaired.
But it was also revealed yesterday that headhunting sculpture vandals
have struck again in Scotland.
A giant fibreglass sculpture of two Japanese wrestlers has had one of
its heads removed at Leith Docks.
The Leith decapitation is believed to have taken place last week,
disfiguring the sculpture by Scottish artist David Mach. The work was
set up as an open-air display on Forth Ports Authority land by Edinburgh
District Council.
As detectives continued their hunt for the Moore culprits yesterday,
the heavy bronze was removed from its hillside site, overlooking
Glenkiln Reservoir, near Dumfries.
Supervising the operation was Mr John Farnham, who was Moore's
assistant and is an expert in transporting and repairing sculptures.
With the help of estate workers, he used an agricultural digger to
lift the work from the rocky outcrop where it has stood for 40 years.
Protected by straw bales, it was put on a farm trailer and taken to a
place of safety on the estate, owned by Mr Henry Keswick, a director of
Jardine Matheson.
The sculpture will be transported to Hadham in Herefordshire, for
repair.
Mr Farnham said: ''It would have been easier to repair if we had the
heads of the two figures, but they are missing. We might have to cast
new heads.''
Divers will search in the reservoir for the heads on Saturday.

MILLIONAIRE electricity boss Ed Wallis yesterday rekindled the ''fat
cat'' pay row by revealing three additional ''little jobs'' which net
him more than an MP's salary and well over double the national average
wage.
The PowerGen chief executive first confirmed to the all-party Commons
employment committee that he received #1.2m from PowerGen last year in
the form of salary (#300,0000), pension (#50,000), and share options
(#876,000).
He also confirmed that he was entitled to share options, currently
worth #332,000, over the next few years.
But it was a throwaway line about another three non-executive
positions, with the British Standards Institute, Mercury Asset
Management and German power generating company RVE, which upset the MPs.
Between them the three jobs take up as much as four or five days a
year yet attracted a total of #36,000, compared to an MP's basic salary
of #33,189.
''I don't call them jobs. They are just little jobs done in my own
time,'' said Mr Wallis.
Both he and PowerGen chairman Sir Colin Southgate, who gets #150,000
for his part-time one-day-a-week chairmanship of PowerGen to supplement
the #505,000 he gets from his real job as chairman of electrical giant
Thorn-EMI, suggested there was no need for legislation to control
executive salaries.
Full disclosure of all directors' remuneration, backed up by Stock
Exchange regulations if necessary, would suffice.
PowerGen salaries were based on the ''rate for the job'' reflecting
the growing competition which has seen a previously monopolistic company
converting to a situation where they now held 25% of the market, down
from 33%, and due to fall further to 22%.
The investigation by MPs also disovered that PowerGen intends to axe a
further 700 to 1000 jobs in addition to the 5400 which have been shed
since privatisation in 1989, when the workforce stood at 9500.
The employment committee is now to have a private meeting with Sir
Richard Greenbury, the #700,000 head of Marks and Spencer, who is
chairing a CBI committee on executive pay.
Meanwhile, a truce has been declared by Tories who had been attempting
to unseat the committee chairman, Labour MP Greville Janner. It seems
they have agreed to lay off the millionaire Labour MP provided no new
executives are hauled before the committee.

VETERAN Scottish actor Robert Urquhart, who appeared in films with
some of Hollywood's biggest stars, died yesterday. He was 72.
Born in Ullapool, he went to school in Edinburgh and trained at RADA,
before beginning his acting career in Glasgow.
He appeared in many Scottish stage roles and in a number of TV roles,
but his film breakthrough came in 1957, in Hammer's The Curse of
Frankenstein, with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.
A year later, he starred alongside John Mills and Richard Attenborough
in Dunkirk, and then, in 1963, he appeared with Charlton Heston, David
Niven, Ava Gardner, and Dame Flora Robson in 55 Days at Peking.
Mr Urquhart's most recent major role was in the 1985 cult Scottish
comedy, Restless Natives, while his best- known TV series were
Pathfinders and The Amazing Mr Goodhall.
For the last two decades, he ran a hotel and arts centre in Ullapool,
with his second wife Jean.
Mr Urquhart, who had recently had a second heart bypass operation,
died in an Edinburgh hospital. He is survived by his wife, and two
teenage children.

EASE off on the claret to toast the Auld Alliance: red wine may not be
as healthy for us as some people claim.
Scotland's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Robert Kendell, claims the
evidence in favour of red wine's protecting against heart disease is
pretty weak.
Writing in the Scottish Health Bulletin, he says the notion of its
health-giving properties is now widespread. ''I myself have been assured
both by a professor of cardiology and a distinguished epidemiologist
that the evidence is really strong, though when challenged, neither
could provide that evidence.''
There was good scientific backing for the beneficial effects of one or
two alcoholic drinks a day. In most studies, mortality was 30-40% lower
than in complete abstainers but this applied to beer, spirits or wine
drinkers.
Dr Kendell says: ''The red wine story seems to be derived from the
well-known 'French paradox'. Despite smoking as much as we do and having
similar blood cholesterol levels, the French have an age-adjusted
coronary heart disease mortality that is less than a quarter of ours.
And, of course, they drink far more alcohol than we do, mostly as red
wine.''
However, this did not amount to hard evidence. Other factors such as
diet and use of olive oil were also involved and, as the French have
drunk less red wine over the last 30 years, fewer have been dropping
dead with heart attacks.
Dr Kendell reckons the reason the red wine theory has found so much
favour is not because of promotion by the alcohol industry but because
we all want to believe it.
''Despite our long-standing political rivalry, the British secretly
admire and envy the French and their apparent immunity from heart
attacks, despite their disdain for health education.
''And how convenient and satisfying it would be if claret, burgundy,
and phenolic flavenoids were the explanation for their puzzling immunity
from coronary heart disease.''

Stobieside House is within 23 miles of Glasgow by road. It is 6 miles
from Strathaven Station (C. Rwy) and 5 miles from Darvel (G. and S.W.
Rwy). The house is modern and convenient and overlooks the Field of
Drumclog and its Monument. It has Central Heating, Acetylene Gas, and an
ample supply of Water by gravitation. There are 3 large Public Rooms,
Gunroom, 9 Bedrooms, Servants' Hall and excellent Accommodation for 6
servants...
THE above is an extract from an advertisement placed in the Property
for Sale columns of The Glasgow Herald on Wednesday, February 11, 1920,
by the Strath aven firm of solicitors and estate agents, Gebbie &amp;
Wilson.
The house at that time was part of a small sporting estate owned by
the Leadbetter family extending to '980 Imperial Acres or thereby', and
including five farms and three cottages, writes Eileen Crone.
It was eventually sold as a separate lot in 1924 for #2,500 to Samuel
Cameron, a well-known professor of obstetrics at Glasgow University.
The next time the house was sold it was advertised by Gebbie &amp; Wilson
in the Scotland's Homes columns of The Herald -- 75 years later almost
to the day. This time the asking price was offers over #250,000, and the
sale was achieved in three weeks.
Gebbie &amp; Wilson is a traditional Scottish law firm which was
established in 1816 and has been selling properties since 1885 at least.
Senior partner William W Park, has been with the firm nearly 40 years,
and his family has been in the area since 1777.
He showed me a cuttings book of advertisements that tells a
fascinating story. The style of copywriting may have changed over the
decades, but Gebbie &amp; Wilson have always advertised in The Herald.
Stobieside House, with its crow-stepped gables and corner turrets
stands 850ft above sea level, which gives it extensive views to the west
over Ayrshire. It was extensively renovated in 1987.
There is no telling how long it will remain in its new owner's hands,
but no doubt when it comes on the market Gebbie &amp; Wilson will again
handle the sale. And again advertise it in The Herald.

THE Rev John Jolly, who conducted the funerals of three of the
victims, said there would be a sense of relief in Drumchapel that the
trial was over, writes Keith Sinclair.
However, he added that the grieving would continue for a long time yet
for relatives of the dead.
Mr Jolly, the locum minister at St Andrew's Drumchapel Church and
chaplain to Pinewood Primary School, which two of the dead Guides
attended, refused to comment on the outcome of the trial and the angry
reponse of some relatives. He said: ''My remit is to help and comfort
those affected, and the church will continue to support them in every
way we can.''
Mr Jolly carried out a ceremony at which the two youngest victims of
the crash were remembered by their classmates at the school's
Thanksgiving service. Matching plaques were unveiled in memory of
Margaret-Ann Riddick, 11, and Catherine McKnight, 10, at the ceremony.
He also conducted the girls' funeral services and that of Mrs Robina
Dougall.
The courage and spirit shown by Guides and their leaders since the
crash was also praised at a memorial service for the victims at
Wellington Church in Glasgow in January, attended by more than 300
people.
The service was led by the Rev Eileen Manson, former county
commissioner for Renfrewshire Guides, who said in her address that many
people had felt ''confusion, anger and despair'' after losing loved ones
and friends.
Mr Colin Grey, a senior teacher at Pinewood Primary, also declined
yesterday to comment on the outcome of the case, but said that pupils
and staff had slowly been able to put the tragedy behind them.
''A psychologist attended the school shortly after the accident and
counselled children who were directly involved as well as others who
were not on the bus but maybe lost a good friend. Teachers and parents
were also offered counselling.''

MURRAY RITCHIE, European Editor in Brussels
BELGIAN police yesterday raided offices of the European Commission in
Brussels in connection with fraud inquiries.
By coincidence, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang was visiting the
Commission on the same day to push the Government's case for more
anti-fraud pressure on the European Union.
Mr Lang was ending a two-day visit to Brussels, during which he
emphasised that he had not changed his pro-European stance despite
Conservative party infighting.
His talks were held with Mr Erkki Liikanen, European Commissioner in
charge of the EU's #60bn annual budget. Mr Lang pressed home the point
that the EU must be more vigilant in attacking misuse of EU funds.
Around the time his meeting with Mr Liikanen was taking place, the
Belgian police entered Commission offices searching for evidence in
their investigation into alleged misuse of funds destined for tourism
projects.
A spokesman for the Commission emphasised that the raid had taken
place at the Commission's request. The investigation is long running and
has already led to the suspension of three officials -- one French and
two Greek -- while inquiries continue into the suspected misuse of funds
for Portuguese tourist investments.
The three officials are being investigated in an affair where it is
alleged that kick-backs of #300,000 were involved in the award of
contracts.
The raid took place against a background of growing demand for a fraud
crackdown, with British Ministers foremost among those calling for
tougher action. The Commission reported last year that #320m went
astray, a rise of 50% on the year before.
* Mr Lang's visit, during which he commended direct Scottish contact
with EU commerce and business under the umbrella of Scotland Europa, was
condemned last night by the SNP as ''absurd''.
Dr Allan Macartney, SNP Euro-MP for North East Scotland, recalled that
the Cabinet was planning to undermine the small member states of the EU
by arguing that their right to appoint one Commissioner each should be
withdrawn. He derided Mr Lang's intention to forge closer links with the
smaller EU states including Finland, Sweden, and Denmark.
''As long as Scotland remains in the unequal British union we are
prevented from developing mutually beneficial, direct links with our
fellow northern European nations,'' he said. ''Our voice is twisted and
distorted by a hostile Westminster Government.''

THE parents of one of the girls who died when the bus hit the low
bridge last night asked: ''Who killed our daughter?''
Those were the bitter words of Mr Joe McKnight, 44, as he struggled to
come to terms with a jury verdict he described as ''unbelievable''.
''The past six months have been sheer hell, and after today there is
no end to it and no future in sight.''
His anguish strikes sparks against the anger of his wife Joanne, 39,
as they sit in their Drumchapel flat reflecting on a life they say is
shattered.
Against the blue-papered chimney breast is a black bordered photograph
of a young girl. Her smile captivates the room. Under the photo the
inscription: ''Catherine McKnight. 28 October 1983 - 19 September
1994.''
By the fireside their nine-year old and youngest son Joseph chews
sweets, looking bemused. Teenager Elizabeth sits at her mother's feet
staring at the carpet. She leaves after five minutes unable, it seems,
to cope with the recollections.
With the tragic death of Catherine -- ''six months ago last
Saturday'', observes Joanne -- they have lost a sister and ''beautiful
daughter'', while the man who in their eyes is responsible has ''walked
free''.
''Everything is broken. It's a living hell,'' says Mr McKnight.
''She was my wee pal. She was special. I miss her not getting into bed
in the morning for a wee cuddle.''
His wife adds: ''She still had her whole life in front of her. She
could have grown up and had kids of her own.''
Both parents bristle at the court verdict.
Mr McKnight said: ''He was done for careless driving.'' But he wanted
to know who was responsible for the deaths.
''Somebody must be. At the end of the day the driver will get a few
penalty points on his licence and a fine. Ours is a life sentence.
''On August 31 he reversed into somebody, yet 18 days later they give
him a bus-load of wee girls.
''I used to stand under that bridge when I was a kid and wait for my
dad. You'd even duck if you were driving a Transit under it.''
The family have struggled to cope with life since last September. Mr
McKnight admits that he has taken to drink and their marriage has hit
trouble with a separation when the coping became too hard to handle.
''It hurts so much,'' he says. ''We no longer have any life. I talk
about it all the time. That helps.''
Mrs McKnight adds: ''I get up in the morning and see the kids go to
school and mine isn't among them. I see them come home again and she
still isn't there.
''The kids find it really hard. Elizabeth writes poems to her and we
found this letter under Joseph's pillow.''
A small piece of paper bears the hand of a nine-year-old. It reads:
''On 19th September my big sister died and I miss her very much. I wish
it hadn't happened at all. I don't like suffering and I want her back
even if it was for one night. I miss you Catherine.''

HERE'S a contentious thought to be going on with. ''Rent is best. And
it's cheaper than buying.''
The words come from Stephen O'Neill, a relative newcomer in the rental
field celebrating the first anniversary of his Rental Homes business.
''I was an estate agent for 14 years,'' he adds. ''And it occurred to
me that we were seducing young people into buying homes, using security
and value for money as our argument.
''Add to that the Eighties boom, and we couldn't lose. But, as we all
know, things turned sour, and the dream of owning your own home turned
into a nightmare for some.
''No one has ever compared renting to mortgages in any meaningful
way,'' he claims, ''and if you listened to some of my former colleagues,
you would think that letting agents were a cross between Rachman and
Attila the Hun.''
All good knockabout stuff, but what are the factual points Stephen
puts forward?
''I base my calculations on real costs, in a scenario where a young
person of 26 buys a property of value around #40,00 -- average rent
about #375 or thereby. No one ever explains that buying is economical
only if you intend to stay in one place for five years or more.
''Even then, you only get the full benefit if you stay for about 10
years. What young person is going to have the same set of circumstances
at 36 as they did at 26?''
Stephen O'Neill comes up with these figures...
Age of purchaser: 26. Length of occupation: two years.
Outlays: Legal fees, #1000. Carpets, curtains etc, #2500. Selling
fees, #2000. Factor, #1000. Wear and tear, #1000. Building insurance,
#200. Total: #7700.
Reduce that by #2000 to cover profit on sale with 2% inflation
estimated. Real cost, #5700. Divide that by 24 calendar months gives a
monthly cost of, say, #235. Add that to average mortgage for #40,000
property of #295.
This brings the real cost of the property to #530 a month.
He compares that with the average rent for a #40,000 property, say
#375 or thereby a month. Difference, #155 a month.
Mr O'Neill suggests we should have a more European view of things. In
France or Germany, he points out, people buy only when they are ready to
settle down for life. Until then, they rent. That gives flexibility, to
change circumstances as and when need may arise.
He adds: ''We manage in excess of #4m of domestic property in Glasgow.
''Take Glendowart Court, in Buccleuch Street, as an example. It's an
upper floor, modern flat, in a small development in landscape grounds.
Just off the city centre, inside the ring road area. Altogether, a
pleasant urban feel to it, with nice gardens.
''The development was built about 15 years ago. You get hallway,
lounge/dining room, fitted kitchen, double bedroom with fitted
wardrobes, bathroom with shower.
''Entry is by the usual security-controlled communal front door and
there is private parking space with a lockable bollard. It is handy for
Sauchiehall Street and local amenities.
''Rent is around #385 a month. Isn't that good value for money? Ideal
for the busy city gent, or lady. Better than buying?'' he asks.
You can argue it out on 0141 304 0032.

A MOUNTAIN guide who was instructing a three-strong party in ice and
snow climbing insisted yesterday that he tested for avalanche danger
three times -- despite the two survivors of a fatal avalanche saying he
had tested only once.
Mr Kevin O'Neill, 40, from Cumbria, was giving evidence yesterday at
the second day of a fatal accident inquiry at Dingwall into the death of
Dr Katharine Herd, 28, of Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire.
Dr Herd died from head injuries the day after an avalanche swept her
and her two fellow students 400ft down Liathach, a 3458ft mountain in
Torridon, Wester Ross.
Mr O'Neill said he had no recollection of the avalanche itself. He
remembered climbing alongside Dr Herd, who was roped to Marcus Cross,
then 17, in the lead and Dr Robin Dawson, 27, who was roped behind her.
The next thing he knew, he was walking in the heather at the foot of
the mountain. When the avalanche happened, the party had been at around
2400ft.
Mr O'Neill said he did not know how he had got there or that there had
been an avalanche and for some reason had decided to walk to his car to
meet up with his students on the other side of the mountain.
Despite having a fractured skull, collar bone, and ankle, as well as
other injuries, he made it to his car.
The next thing he remembered was someone tapping on the car window. He
had no recollection of being flown to hospital by helicopter.
On the first day of the inquiry, Dr Dawson, from Dumfries, and Marcus
Cross, from Aberdeen, said their instructor had tested for avalanche
danger -- and to show them how it was done -- just before the climb
proper started.
Neither could remember any further tests as the climb progressed.
Under pressure from Mr James Hendry, for the relatives of Dr Herd, Mr
O'Neill said he had never been more than a metre from the students as
they climbed Trotter's Gully.
He could not explain why they had not seen him carry out two further
''snow profiles''.
Mr O'Neill described the snow conditions on January 16, 1994, as
''friendly'' even though there was a low to medium avalanche risk.
Had he thought there was any danger he would have attached himself to
the three students and used rock belays (anchors).
This would have slowed the climb down but if necessary he would have
done it.
Mr O'Neill, a qualified guide and instructor with experience in
different parts of the world, said the Scottish mountains were
particularly dangerous because of the way the weather could change so
swiftly.
The avalanche risks in areas of Lochaber, Glencoe, and Cairngorm were
well known ''in some cases to within a foot'' because of the large
number of people using these mountains.
However, Torridon was part of ''the last wilderness'' where he could
climb for weeks on end and see no-one but his students and when
footprints in the snow were seen they were liable to be his own from a
previous climb.
The inquiry continues.

BUS driver Campbell Devlin, 30, was yesterday cleared of causing the
deaths of three Girl Guides and two of their leaders when the bus he was
driving hit a low bridge in West Street, Glasgow, last September.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday women in the jury were reduced to
tears as relatives of the girls shouted and swore at them.
Devlin, of Rannoch Street, Cathcart, Glasgow, was found not guilty of
causing the five deaths, and 15 injuries, six of them serious, by
driving a double-decker bus dangerously on September 18 last year.
He was found guilty of the lesser charge of careless driving. Sheriff
Bell deferred sentence for three weeks for social inquiry and community
service reports and continued bail.

AN 83-year-old Earl and close friend of the Queen is set to marry a
woman more than 30 years his junior.
The Earl of Wemyss and March, who is deaf and has trouble walking, is
to wed divorcee Mrs Shelagh Kennedy, 51, after what she described as ''a
whirlwind romance''.
They have yet to name a date but it is thought they will marry within
months.
The Earl's first wife Mavis died seven years ago. Last year, Mrs
Kennedy helped him through the death of a close female friend.
It is thought the former Queen's Body Guard for Scotland, a member of
the Royal Company of Archers, wanted to keep the ceremony a secret.
However, the Earl, born Francis Charteris, recently visited his local
register office to make the wedding plans public, although he still
chose not to tell staff at his mansion, Gosford House, Longniddry, East
Lothian.
Mrs Sheila Davidson of the register office at North Berwick said the
banns, which must be publicly displayed before any wedding, can have the
date of the marriage added as late as 24 hours before the exchange of
vows.
She said the widowed Earl must marry within three months or he will
need to apply for fresh banns to be displayed.
She said: ''His intentions took everyone by surprise but it has been
around seven years since his wife died so he deserves another shot at
happiness.''
Mrs Kennedy said last night it was a ''share of hobbies'' that had
brought her and the Earl of Wemyss together. The 32-year age gap between
them would not stop the marriage being a ''great success'', she said.
She works for the National Trust for Scotland and said she first met
the Earl when he was appointed president of the trust in 1980.
She said they soon established a close working bond and remained
friends after he resigned four years ago.
No personal relationship had formed until recently, she said, when she
had been swept off her feet by his affection. She said: ''We have had a
whirlwind romance but our friendship has been deep-rooted for several
years.
''We are both passionate about our love for the National Trust for
Scotland, and share interests in everything from the restoration of
antiques to gardening.
''Age isn't what's important in a marriage. It's common interests and
friendship that counts.''
Mrs Kennedy, who has one grown-up son, said she hoped to marry before
the end of next month.

THE actor Nigel Hawthorne has revealed he is homosexual, and plans to
take his partner Trevor to the Oscar ceremony in Hollywood at the
weekend.
Mr Hawthorne, famed for his role in the hit TV series Yes Minister,
said: ''I will be attending the Oscars with Trevor.
''My friends have said 'what about the Oscars, with banks of
photographers clicking?'
''And I said I dread it because I'm quite a quiet person.''
He added: ''My idea is to have a good evening and do a bit of star
spotting.''
Mr Hawthorne, 65, reveals details of his relationship in an interview
in the US gay magazine The Advocate.
He is in the US promoting his new film The Madness of King George,
which has won him an Oscar nomination for best actor.
Mr Hawthorne, who played Sir Humphrey Appleby in Yes Minister, told
the magazine: ''I'm not somebody who sets himself up as an icon of
sexual orientation.
''But my private life has never been a secret. I've never been a
closet queen.''
He did not reveal his partner's full name, describing him only as a
51-year-old writer. Their relationship began 15 years ago.
''Trevor and I are very happy and very lucky. We have had a long
relationship. It has been totally successful.
''Trevor and I are both very quiet people and we both just want to
live and keep the peace.
''It's not a transitory thing. It's for life. We both know that and I
think we're very privileged.''
Mr Hawthorne also revealed that he thinks his homosexuality may help
him find greater depth in the characters he portrays.
''I'm not scared of showing my emotion for example -- and I think a
lot of Englishmen are. They like to bottle it all up and I don't care,''
he said.
''So I have that freedom which perhaps I wouldn't have had I been a
married man.''

THOUGH their town has a tourist office and is on the Covenanter Trail,
the residents of Strathaven find it puzzling that American visitors
should find their way there in the summer. Perhaps the tourists have
heard about the local delicacy, Stra'ven toffee, which is like tablet
and is popular with children on the many Sunday school trips attracted
by the town's excellent parks.
Strathaven (pronounce it Strayven) is a small Lanarkshire town closeby
Hamilton and East Kilbride, and 18 miles from Glasgow. Its
fifteenth-century ruined castle was once home to the Earls of Douglas,
and later the Dukes of Hamilton.
Part of the town is designated a conservation area, and recent
improvements include the refurbishment of the castle, landscaping and
street cobbling around Kirk Street, and new signposts mapping out the
points of interest.
Strathaven retains the atmosphere of a market town and much of the
hinterland has productive dairy farms, with the prospering L.S.Smellie
Auction Mart holding sales every Monday. The town is on high ground and
has a reputation for getting snowed-in. Luckily the need to get the milk
to market means that the snow ploughs are out sharpish. Just as well,
for many people commute to Glasgow or drive their kids to school.
Strathaven is just seven miles from the main motorway network to the
central belt. Unfortunately the rail link to the town was closed many
years ago.
Douglas Mackenzie, a director at Roy Slater and town resident for 18
years, says: ' I have sold houses in Strathaven to large numbers of
relocating English people, because it is the nearest you can get to an
English village. I also sell to commuters and to people in Kilmarnock.
'Sometime next year we are to be involved with the sale of new ribbon
development by local builder Jardine Paterson outside the town at the
village of Sandford.' Mr Mackenzie has also sold a splendid mill house
in the town to a member of Simple Minds, and subsequently to a friend.
In contrast to East Kilbride, Strathaven has its amenities within
walking distance. There are good local shops around the Common Green and
a strong business/traders association is keen to maintain standards.
Small supermarkets (Spar, Gateway and Co-op) are backed up by Safeways
and Sainsbury at East Kilbride eight miles away. There is a library, a
sports centre, the Town Mill Theatre, and a variety of social clubs.
The four churches and a chapel include the interesting East Church on
Allison Green. Strathaven Academy is high in the league table, and many
families in Larkhall are keen to send their children there. The school
is host after-hours to squash, badminton and five-a-side football.
The town has two splendid parks - the John Hastie and the George Allan
- which have model railways, a boating pond, a bandstand which is the
focus of the summer gala, playparks, a museum highlighting Covenanting
relics, bowling greens, sports pitches and the Powmillon Burn.
The burn runs right through the town and under the listed Boo Backit
Brig.
The private Strathaven Golf Club has a long waiting list. For
equestrian pursuits, the Letham House Riding School is popular, and
houses with a couple of acres and stabling become available from time to
time. Liz Gordon, who is selling Westlinbank House, Gilmourton, through
Clyde Property, says: 'I have lived here for six years and it is
marvellous for country walks and hacking horses - my daughter is into
ponies. We can easily drive to Ayr in the summer and the close-knit
atmosphere is great for young families.
Mrs Gordon adds: 'There is a prison nearby, but it is of 'open' status
and no threat. Dangers of being snowed-in are exaggerated: the children
have only once failed to make it to school in Glasgow.'
Strathaven has developed alongside East Kilbride and many people moved
into the area in the Sixties and Seventies when they got jobs in the new
town with employers like Motorola. Andrew Park built a lot of new
housing at that time and these resell well.
Strathaven has an excellent choice of both new and old properties for
the size of the place.
Patricia Mullen, office manager at Slater, Hogg &amp; Howison, says:
'There are very desirable pockets, such as Letham Road, Cullen Park
Grove, Glasgow Road and Townhead Street. Prices are on a par with East
Kilbride, with detached properties selling from #70,000 to around
#190,000 for luxury villas by Wimpey and Insignia.'
Jenny Gilchrist at Clyde Property says the market at the moment is
'steady if a bit slow.'
Barratt is building 36 two and three-bedroom homes from #55,000 to
#75,000 at The Rushes, off Newton Road. Other developments include those
by Tilbury Douglas at Avon Grove, Cala and Wimpey at Cullin Park,
Insignia Homes at Castle View, and L&amp;C Estates on Hamilton Road.
Being snowed-in might not be such a bad thing. There is a 170-year-old
bakery called Taylor's at which to sample the best in Scottish savouries
while you await the snow ploughs.

THEY say that the three most important factors in property are
location, location, and location. That certainly seems to be borne out
in two surveys by builders into house purchase decisions by Scots.
After location, Scots list living space, value for money, design and
layout as the most important features when choosing a new home,
according to the Barratt survey which was carried out among the 100,000
visitors to their four flagship show villages around Britain.
The villages were created to launch Barratt's new Premier Collection
range of house styles and to gauge reaction to the new designs.
Barratt Northern chairman Mike Norton said: ''The response has been
extremely positive. This is because we are building what the customer
wants, traditional cottage style homes with lots of extra features at
value-for-money prices.
Over 95% of respondents told us they thought the new designs were
either ''good'' or ''excellent''.
''Externally , design features, quality of workmanship and choice of
building materials scored highly, while inside, people were impressed
with the room layouts, kitchens and bathrooms and general use of space.
''Four out of five visitors felt that the houses represented good
value for money.''
The show villages included Wallace Park at Stirling, where the most
popular of the ten fully-furnished showhouses on display was the
Devonshire four-bedroom family house, followed by the three-bedroom
Allenby.
Barratt, recently voted Housebuilder of the Year, are now building new
Premier Collection house styles on most of their 20 developments in
Scotland. Prices range from around #45,000 to #170,000.
Meanwhile, a similar survey by Beazer Homes reveals that Scots are not
the thriftiest people in the UK when it comes to house-buying decisions.
Beazer researched buying patterns at 300 developments throughout the
UK and was surprised to discover that Scots were not as financialy
cautious as had been supposed. Only 4% of Scots said that interest rates
affected their buying decisions, compared wit h a UK average of 21%.
Where part-exchange was the most popular incentive, many Scots said
they would still have bought the home of their fancy even if the
incentive not been available.
The survey also confirmed that in Scotland the first consideration
when buying a new home is its location, while most of the UK rated this
as of equal importance to product and price.
Beazer's sales director, Maureen Anderson said the results had clearly
positioned the Scots as individuals with well-defined buying patterns.
'The majority of those questioned in Scotland said they would prefer
their new home to be positioned in a cul-de-sac, while more and more
people were looking for a carefully planned development designed for
modern living.
''Inside the house, an increasing number of people expressed an
interest in the luxury of en-suite facilities and in such cases most
said they would prefer a shower to a bath.''
Gas was given the thumbs-up right across the UK as the preferred form
of central heating. Spacious rooms, double glazing and 10-year
warranties were all high on the buying criteria agenda. Other modern day
extras such as patio doors and conservatories were not considered
important fixtures by most buyers.
This is the second national survey conducted by Beazer. David Perrie,
managing director of Beazer Homes Scotland, said: ''The results of the
surveys are a crucial indicator that the building of new homes in
Scotland requires its own individual approach.

IF you've been wondering whatever happened to the appeal against your
council tax banding that you submitted two years ago, take heart from
one home owner's experience in Clarkston.
A few weeks ago he received notice of a hearing by an independent
committee to hear both his argument and the counter-claim of Strathclyde
Regional Council. With the hearing still more than a week away, the
council called to announce it would be round to reassess the property.
Our home owner found himself in the odd position of having to point
out all his house's faults -- the spot where the roof let in the rain,
the rotten window-frames, etc -- to two men in trench coats, who were so
impressed they agreed on the spot to move the house to a lower band and
refund two years of overpayments.
They left, but a minute later were back at the door, looking less
sympathetic. One of them had a six-inch tear in his expensive raincoat
after an altercation with a rosebush in the garden.
Which left one relieved home owner wondering what the outcome would
have been had the rosebush attacked them as they arrived.

TWO in every three of the 40,000 appeals against house valuations in
Strathclyde have been successful so far, admits the regional assessor's
office. But a lower valuation in many cases has not been enough to take
the property into a lower council tax band.
Anyone moving home has an opportunity to save thousands in tax over
the years, but you will need to take action within a few months of
settling into your new house. Shortly after taking up residence you
should receive notification of your council tax banding, and if you feel
that the band is too high compared to your neighbours then you can lodge
an appeal with the regional assessor.
All you have to do is send a reply to the notification pointing out
that you do not believe that the band applied to your property reflects
its value.
''It's well worth appealing,'' says Alasdair Seale of Edinburgh-based
Trinity Factoring Services. ''We've had an 80% success rate in getting
bands reduced on appeal.'' But he makes the point that his firm's
expertise allows it to predict fairly accurately which homes are
unlikely to win on appeal and clients are advised accordingly, saving
time and money.
''We really only lodge an appeal when we are sure there is a strong
case. A successful appeal might save you #200 a year,'' he says. He
points out that the council tax does not just affect owner-occupiers;
people moving into private rented accommodation can also appeal their
banding.
''In many cases a straightforward clerical or typing error has
occurred and a house has been put into the wrong band as a result. These
can often be sorted out over the telephone,'' says Alasdair Seale.
''More complicated cases might require the help of professional
surveyor. In our experience roughly one in six people who contact us has
valid grounds for an appeal.''
People living in large houses which have been converted might find
that they have a case. When houses were assessed for the council tax,
registration officers simply assessed whole streets at a time.
''Sometimes a one-off house is wrongly assessed because there are no
other properties with which to compare it,'' says Brian Allison of
surveyors D M Hall. ''It's quite possible for such properties to be
moved into a lower band. And people who find themselves affected by the
new M77 have a case for appeal.''
If a house has an extension built after it has been valued, then it
will be revalued when it is next sold. If part of the house is
demolished, then it might qualify for reassessment into a lower band.
When the council tax replaced the poll tax, Strathclyde Regional
Council's Assessor's Department had to value about a million residential
properties within a very short period.
A spokesman for the Assessor's Department said that approximately
40,000 appeals had been lodged against the original valuations, of which
roughly two-thirds had been successful. Most of those appeals shifted
the valuation of the property as at April 1, 1991, by only five or 10%,
which meant that not all of those properties switched bands, because
many of them were valued in the middle of the band and some of the bands
are quite broad.
''But it would be fair to say that a reasonable number of people did
have their house put into the next band downward.''
The council tax system was now operating smoothly, he said, and only a
very small number of subsequent appeals were likely to be successful.
''Anyone who thought that they had a two-thirds chance of succeeding
would be making a mistake. Most properties are now firmly established in
their band,'' he added.

THE Prime Minister has launched another attempt to co-ordinate his
Government to try to find a way to compete in the next General Election,
and prevent the almost weekly gaffes of Ministers.
Mr Major yesterday announced a new Cabinet committee, known as ECD/P,
which will attempt to unify the Tory Party on a long-term strategy to
continue in government.
The team of four will be chaired by Mr David Hunt, Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster (Mr Major's new chief of staff -- and chief
troubleshooter). Commons leader Tony Newton and his opposite number in
the Lords, Viscount Cranborne, are included, as is party chairman Jeremy
Hanley, Minister without Portfolio.
The ECD/P nomenclature is supposed to stand for ''the co-ordination
and presentation of Government policy''. Co-ordination is obviously
required. The move comes as yet another Cabinet row broke out, with two
of Mr Major's most senior Ministers at loggerheads over the return of
the ''feel-good factor'' on the economy.
It will start meeting immediately and may develop into a kitchen
Cabinet, provided that key Ministers like President of the Board of
Trade Michael Heseltine and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke are brought in to
its strategic planning.
If it proves to be effective in avoiding banana skins and the
devastating succession of Ministerial gaffes, it could well develop into
the Prime Minister's key administrative weapon for imposing party unity
and dictating election manifestos.
The emergence of this new committee coincided with another conflict of
opinion between Cabinet Ministers. Last week, Mr Clarke warned that the
electorate may not feel the benefits of economic recovery until after
the next General Election. Yesterday, Home Secretary Michael Howard, at
a Tory Central Office news conference, confidently predicted a
reappearance of the ''feel-good factor'', well before the next General
Election.
The Chancellor, discomfited by this, responded: ''Well, there we are.
That must be very encouraging news. One thing I always say is that I do
not go in for forecasting human emotions.''
The lack of co-ordination was further demonstrated by Mr Hanley at the
news conference when he suggested that the threat of a Labour Government
might be causing instability of sterling in the currency markets.
However, Mr Howard had insisted at the same conference that only the
Chancellor or other Treasury Ministers should comment on the markets or
the value of sterling.
The new committee has to sort out this kind of thing if the Tories are
to recover credibility. Within an hour of the new committee's
announcement by Mr Major in a written answer to the Commons, jokes were
already being made: ECD/P was being read as ''Emergency Cabinet
Defence/Propaganda''.
Meanwhile Labour leader Tony Blair is reported to be set to warn his
Shadow Cabinet Mr Major could soon be ousted and a snap poll called by
his successor. He believes the Tories are in the kind of ''panic mode''
which preceded Lady Thatcher's downfall and that Mr Heseltine is
''limbering up'' on the sidelines.
In preparation he is poised to order his top team of John Prescott,
Gordon Brown, and Robin Cook to bring forward policy and campaigning
plans.

THE housing market has changed quite dramatically over the past 30
years that Bellway Homes has been building homes in Central Scotland.
In 1995, more and more young people are choosing to become home owners
for the first time, many tenants are deciding that they would like to
own their home, and older people are retiring to more suitable homes.
Bellway Homes has been aware of these changing needs and has been
striving to build homes for everyone in the community.
This national company, started in Newcastle and now firmly established
in Scotland, is focused on providing a local service.
''Over the last few years, Bellway has chosen sites in the right
locations, and designed houses specifically for the local market,' said
divisional director Ian Mahon,''and that has meant building quality into
every home, regardless of its cost or location.''
Bellway developments are situated throughout the Central Belt, the hub
of the Scottish market, from Old Kilpatrick in the west to Drumchapel,
Kirkintilloch, Maryhill Locks, Springburn, Robroyston, Garthamlock,
Cumbernauld, Condorrat and into Lanarkshire with developments at
Blantyre, Uddingston and Airdrie.
Further east, a new development of three and four bedroom homes will
be opened within the next month at Parklands, Gilmerton Road in
Edinburgh.
Bellway's development at Dalnottar Grove in Old Kilpartick is a fine
example of maximising the quality of the environment. It comprises 41
spacious three and four bedroom detached houses in a secluded setting.
At Willowbank in Kirkintilloch, Bellway is about to release the final
phase of 40 semi-detached houses, in the middle of the existing
development.
The location is central and close to all the shops, with easy access
to the M80/A80.
Residents range from first time buyers to retired people, and there
are already several enquiries from a wide spectrum of people.
Further along the A80 at The Hawthorns in Cumbernauld, there are only
five houses left and at Cowlairs Grove in Springburn, within minutes of
the city centre, the 24 two bedroom flats with parking spaces are
already proving popular.
Bellway has taken the lead at its Summerhill Gardens in Drumchapel,
building the first private housing in the area. The development has two
and three bedroom semi-detached homes.
According to sales director Iain Davidson, such an extensive building
programme indicates the company's confidence in the housing marketplace:
''Despite what some market commentators are saying, the housing market
is expanding and we should be confident at least in the short term,'' he
said. ''Last year, Bellway completed around 250 new homes and is on
target for 400 this year. That is an increase of over 50 per cent on
last year's figures.''
Today, Bellway has a clear picture of where the housing market in
Scotland really is and is tackling it in a much more aggressive manner
than before. For the past few years, the company has been amassing sites
and planning for the future.
''We have no gimmicks,'' assured Iain Davidson. ''What you see is what
you get, so people know from day one what they are buying.''
Safety is high on Bellway's agenda and the ''Supersave Specification''
is standard with every sale.
This security pack includes a fire extinguisher, first aid kit, window
locks, night lights, socket safety covers, fridge locks and a video
guard.
This, together with good design, generous specifications and value for
money, have all worked to make Bellway Homes a name that is associated
with quality in the Scottish housing market.

A leading Scottish builder is offering houses with room for expansion
in the roofspace. The idea is that as the family grows, or income
increases, two further rooms and a bathroom can be created in the loft
if required.
The two bedroom Kinnaird bungalow has been designed by Stewart Milne
Homes. Previously available in the North East only, its success in
Aberdeen has led to its introduction at the company's developments in
the Central Belt -- including the company's Lathallan Park development
in Polmont, near Falkirk.
The inclusion at the construction stage of Velux windows and specially
designed roof trusses ensures the conversion, when desired, is quick and
inexpensive.
Accommodation also includes an open plan lounge and dining room which
connects to a large fitted dining kitchen. The two bedrooms have fitted
wardrobes and there is additional storage space throughout. The bungalow
also has bay windows and an adjoining garage.
Hamish Bethune, director of Stewart Milne Homes, said: ''The Kinnaird
is ideally suited to young families, as the accommodation can be
extended as the family grows.
It is perfect for Lathallan Park which offers the ideal location for
family living, away f rom the busy city centre but close to the M9 for
easy commuting.''
Prices for the Kinnaird bungalow start at #73,950 and the first will
be ready for occupation in June 1995. Also available at Lathallan Park
are the three bedroom Flamborough and Doirlinn villas with prices from
#76,950.

MILLER HOMES has been shortlisted as one of the final nominees for the
Building Awards, a new scheme designed to recognise the best
housebuilders in the UK.
The other two firms shortlisted in the Northern Housebuilder category
are Henry Boot of Sheffield and Shepherd Homes of York. From its
Edinburgh office, Miller Homes covers both Scotland and the North of
England.
The three firms have been selected following a major survey among 5000
professionals within the construction industry. Each person surveyed was
asked to vote for Northern Housebuilders who came out tops for all-round
performance, cost-effectiveness, image and reputation, and speed and
quality.
Deborah Benson, sales and marketing director for Miller Homes, said:
''We are delighted to have reached this stage. However, Miller Homes
always wants to be No.1, so we are hoping that we will pick up the main
prize at the awards ceremony.''
The overall winner will be announced at a ceremony in London on April
19.
The Building Awards have been organised by Building magazine.
Editor Peter Bill said: ''The three housebuilding firms from Scotland
and the North of England which have been identified as finalists all
have excellent reputations.
''At this stage, it is anybody's guess as to whether the prestigious
trophy for the best Northern Housebuilder will go to Edinburgh,
Sheffield or York.''

STRATHCLYDE Regional Council's roads officials were criticised
yesterday by a sheriff over the death of a off-duty police officer.
Sheriff Lewis Cameron criticised staff responsible for gritting roads
as ''insufficiently trained'' for reacting to weather reports.
He described their procedures as ''alarming'' and blamed Strathclyde
Regional Council for a ''serious breach'' of its duty.
Mr Callum Chisholm, 27, died when his car ploughed in to a truck on a
stretch of the A73 in Lanarkshire which was like an ''ice rink''.
Region chiefs had decided not to grit the road despite weather
forecasts warning of ice ''chiefly in Lanarkshire''.
They also failed to seek clarification, despite having a 24-hour
hotline to the Glasgow Weather Centre.
Mr Chisholm, of Carding Street, Symington, Lanarkshire was travelling
to his work at Stewart Street Police Station, Glasgow, early on March 15
last year when the crash happened on a stretch of road known to be
dangerous, because of water seepage from nearby bings.
His wife, Elizabeth, 37, a mother of three, wept at the inquiry when
she asked the sheriff to find out why the road had not been gritted.
The findings follow a fatal accident inquiry at Hamilton Sheriff Court
into his death.
During the inquiry, Mr Ronald Small, 45, Roads Direct manager for
Lanark North, claimed water ''does not necessarily freeze'' at zero
degrees.
Depute-fiscal Jim Robertson and Mr Peter Watson, representing Mr
Chisholm's family, condemned Mr Small and another official for
attempting to avoid answering questions.
In his findings, Sheriff Cameron said that Mr Small and his staff had
received no formal training for interpreting weather reports.
He also highlighted areas where procedures could be improved,
including training and extended patrols.
The sheriff said: ''A decision was taken that the A73 should not be
gritted that night.
''The road was covered by ice because of the failure of the regional
council to carry out gritting.
''Those who had the decision to make, admitted, in some cases with
marked reluctance, that they got it wrong.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council said: ''Strathclyde Roads
Department is aware of the sheriff's findings and is examining these
relative to its current practices.''
Mr Watson said: ''We are delighted about the outcome of the fatal
accident inquiry, that it confirms our position that the accident was
caused by the failure of the region to grit the road properly.
''We will now be intimating a claim for damages on behalf of Mrs
Chisholm and her children.''

A YOUNG Edinburgh couple who lived next door to a convicted child
molester who was allegedly murdered in his maisonette nearly six weeks
ago were yesterday found dead together in their home.
Last night, police were treating the couple's deaths as a coincidence.
The detective leading the inquiry into the latest tragedy at No 18
Southhouse Medway, a sprawling housing estate on the city outskirts,
indicated that the deaths could be the result of a drugs-related
accident. He ruled out any link with the death of their neighbour, Mr
Lawrence Leydon.
They leave a three-year-old daughter, Charmaine.
Detective Chief Inspector Ronnie Turnbull named them as Steven
Charleston, 26, and Karen McMillan, 25, who was four months' pregnant,
and said: ''Initial forensic inquiry indicates that this is a tragic
accident.''
Police were called at 4.20pm to the couple's home, Flat 9 in the
block, by relatives concerned for their welfare. Officers forced the
door when they got no response.
Relatives stood by anxiously as the police checked out the situation
and until news of the deaths was broken to them.
The couple, whose daughter, Charmaine, is now with her father's
parents, Mr William Charleston and his wife, Pat, at their home in
nearby Burdiehouse, Edinburgh, had lived in the house for a year.
Neighbours, who did not wish to be named, expressed shock. One man
said: ''They didn't deserve that. They were not bad people. They liked a
wee thing like everyone else, but they didn't deserve to die.''
Ms Karen McMillan's uncle, Mr James McMillan, of Magdalene area in
Edinburgh, said: ''She was a great girl.''
An aunt, Mrs Mary Haig, 35, of Gracemount, Edinburgh, said: ''It has
just turned out to be tragic. Karen kept herself to herself and minded
her own business.''
As the relatives and neighbours comforted one another in the street,
Chief Inspector Turnbull said: ''It must be very upsetting for the
residents.''
Last night, the local district councillor, Mr John Wilson, said he was
shocked by the death of the couple.
''It is very sad when anything like this happens, especially coming so
close after the tragedy a few weeks ago.
''It is just coincidental that it has happened in the same block.
Unfortunately, people have been given entirely the wrong impression
about Southhouse, that it is a no-go area, but this is an insult to all
the decent people who live there.''
The body of 36-year-old Mr Leydon, a joiner, was found last month in
his home in Flat 7 of the No 18 block in Southhouse Medway.
Earlier this month, Mr Paul Strathearn, 33, of Buchanan Street,
Edinburgh, appeared on petition at the city's sheriff court charged with
the murder of Mr Leydon at his home in Southhouse Medway on February 11.
Sheriff John Horsburgh continued the case for further inquiries and
remanded Mr Strathearn in custody.

GLASGOW Zoopark might be relocated to the north side of its 100-acre
site at Calderpark and turned into a modern conservation centre, with
its current site turned into a complementary leisure development.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, which has security over the land on which
the zoo was built in 1947, is expected to make a planning application
for the changes after a number of meetings with the zoo's director, Mr
Richard O'Grady, and representatives of Glasgow Development Agency,
Glasgow District Council, and Strathclyde Regional Council.
The Zoological Society of Glasgow and the West of Scotland, which owns
the zoo, has an overdraft of #1.6m with the bank, and a rescue package
mounted last year by Glasgow district and Strathclyde region of #200,000
each has failed to ease the zoo's financial problems. It is expected to
show a deficit of #200,000 this year.
If successful, however, the relocated zoo and new leisure development
could be in place by spring of 1998.
Mr Gordon Macdiarmid, Glasgow's City Treasurer, said: ''The zoo is
still in financial difficulties, but my understanding is that the zoo
intends to relocate to the north of the site and planning permission
will be sought for a leisure facility on the current site. In so doing,
they hope to raise a sufficient capital receipt to solve their financial
problems. That is because the bank, the region, and ourselves are fed up
with rescue packages. We feel the zoo ought to be doing something itself
to resolve its problems.
''I understand the bankers would be happy if the development scheme
can be shown to be viable. It requires a successful planning application
and evidence that the development would generate a sufficiently
substantial capital receipt. If they came to us now and said they were
in grave financial difficulty and looking for more funds, we would
certainly not be terribly pleased and we would be unlikely to respond
positively.
''If, on the other hand, they are saying they can raise a capital
receipt by developing land that is currently the zoo's as a leisure
facility, and they had planning permission and had people wishing to use
it, and they were seeking help with a #50,000 revenue problem, our
answer would likely be positive.''
The zoo closes down its children's zoo each autumn because the weather
is not suitable for domestic animals. A modern zoo, however, could have
a children's farm, other modern animal houses, a good education centre,
shops and restaurants, all under cover, said Mr O'Grady.
''We have to look forward to the next century. This zoo was laid out
at the end of the war. We have got rid of all the cages and tried to
replace them with open plan enclosures,'' he added.
Mr O'Grady realised that as the zoo lay in green-belt land, so a
number of planning restrictions would affect any developments.
It seems unlikely that any of the land owned by the zoo will be turned
into residential use. Instead, the planning authorities will be asked to
consider a leisure development that complements the zoo proposals.
A Travelodge and Beefeater restaurant on land bought by Glasgow
Development Agency adjacent to the zoo should be completed by the end of
this year. Mr O'Grady hopes they will attract families to the zoo,
although sceptics see the development more in terms of a convenient
stopover for travellers on the M74.
Construction work on the M74 near the zoo last year hit the zoo's
attendance figures badly, said Mr O'Grady. He still hopes to receive
financial compensation for the inconvenience caused, although he accepts
that the Scottish Office is under a moral rather than a legal obligation
to pay the zoo any money.
The recession and financial constraints have reduced the zoo's
expenditure to #560,000 a year, cut its permanent staff from 32 to 19,
and reduced its number of animals.
Since 1974, between 7000 and 8000 people have undergone training
programmes at the zoo.
Glasgow Development Agency said yesterday, however, that from next
month, in the next financial year, it will no longer fund the zoo as a
training provider, but will pay another agency to carry out the training
work at the zoo.
Mr O'Grady, however, said he proposed to operate community training
programmes for the long-term unemployed in the zoo's catchment area.
''If we continue with employment training, then we do not want to
administer it ourselves. With cutbacks there is not enough money and
that would be done by an outside agency. We have one operating here
right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Former Rangers manager seeks jail sentence over delay in producing bank account information. Souness and ex-wife in bitter court battle.</HEADLINE>

A BITTER legal row between former Rangers and Liverpool manager Graeme
Souness and his former wife Danielle emerged in the High Court
yesterday, with each accusing the other of failing to come clean about
their finances.
His former wife, who received #500,000 under a Scottish divorce court
settlement six years ago, is now seeking to reopen her claim in England
on the grounds that her former husband failed to reveal full details of
his assets and exerted undue pressure on her to settle.
Her claim is resisted by Mr Souness, whose lawyers yesterday sought a
suspended jail sentence against her for ''blatant disregard'' of a court
order requiring her to produce bank statements indicating what had
happened to money in her accounts.
Ms Alison Ball, counsel for Mr Souness, 41, of Colinton, Edinburgh,
told Judge Slot that one matter of concern was the apparent transfer of
#1.8m from an account held in Majorca, where the couple once lived and
owned property.
Ms Caroline Willbourne, for his ex-wife, 39, of Pen House Close,
Bramhall, Stockport, Greater Manchester, accepted the information
provided so far was incomplete, but said solicitors were having great
difficulty obtaining documents from the Spanish authorities, who did not
seem to have a proper understanding of compliance with court orders.
The documents would be obtained, she said, and added that the move for
a suspended prison committal order against her was ''heavy-handed''.
Judge Slot adjourned the case to a full hearing on April 26, but said
he hoped the information required would be provided in the meantime.
Told earlier that she was on legal aid, the judge commented: ''I am
not going to sit idly by and see public funds used on a frolic of this
kind if the legally-aided litigant is not going to provide the
information necessary for the court to do its job.''
The couple married in July 1980 and separated in November 1988. They
have three children, Chantelle, 19, from his ex-wife's previous
marriage, Fraser, 13, and Jordan, 10.
Miss Ball told the judge that the 1989 Scottish divorce petition was
never finalised by his client's ex-wife but an agreement on transfer of
property, school fees, maintenance, and payment of a lump sum to her was
registered.
In May 1993, she filed a new divorce petition, based on five years'
separation, and they divorced in London in 1994. An agreement was
reached in respect of school fees and maintenance for the children, when
she made it clear she was not seeking further provision for herself.
Last August, however, she stated she wanted more money for herself
because of her ex-husband's ''failure to disclose and undue pressure''.
Mr Souness's solicitors responded with a questionnaire asking for
details of her finances but, after five months, this had still not been
satisfactorily completed, despite court orders.
Miss Ball said a lot of Mr Souness's money had been paid into one
particular Majorcan bank account during the marriage, and it was now for
the court to ''show its teeth'' by forcing disclosure of that and other
accounts.
No details had been produced of a family trust of which his former
wife was a beneficiary.
The prison committal application was brought ''with reluctance'', said
Miss Ball but ''we have come to the end of our tether''.
Outside court, Ms Willbourne said Mr Souness's move for a jail order
would be ''fiercely resisted''.
Graeme Souness, former player-manager of Rangers, resigned from
Liverpool in January last year after 33 months in charge. In 1992, he
recovered from a triple heart bypass operation. Former model Karen Levy
was his companion at the time and they later married.
