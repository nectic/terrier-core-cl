ASK the sales staff in a showhouse and they will let you into a trade
secret...most houses are sold ''through the back door''. The builders
work much harder nowadays to provide individual exteriors with
impressive front doors, but the factor which clinches the deal is often
the quality of the kitchen.
The quality of the appliances is vital and many houses are sold
through the sheer convenience of the gadgets, working surfaces, and
lay-out of the storage space and white goods.
Families are spending more time in the kitchen. In many homes it has
become a key place for catching up with each other while the cooking is
going on. Builders like Muir Homes at Livingston's Deer Park are
responding by providing larger kitchens and installing convenient
surfaces for a quick breakfast, late supper, or a hurried lunch.
The company also offers busy owners a chance to relax in the 150-acre
golf and country club which adjoins the housing development. Muir is
building nine different house styles in the latest phase at Deer Park,
with prices starting at around #80,000.

THE Government was sharply attacked on its transport policy at the CBI
conference.
Mr Robert Napier, chairman of building products group Redland, and
chairman of the CBI transport policy committee, said the Government had
done a U-turn down the motorway, a U-turn of the same abruptness as its
approach to the housing market.
He said that infrastructure spending already had been cut and seemed
set for a further major reduction in the Budget.
The personal finance initiative had been offered as the private-sector
solution, Mr Napier said, but so far it had failed to deliver.
''PFI certainly wont compensate for the reduction in central
government funding,'' he said.
Commenting on the environmental lobby, , he said the balance of the
debate had moved away from the real needs of business and society as a
whole.
Mr Napier said the UK needed to invest annually about #2000m more in
transport infrastructure than it did at the moment to have a system
which met the same high standards as its main European competitors.
''A Budget on November 28 which cuts transport spending and places too
much emphasis too soon on the PFI is not acceptable to business'' he
told the conference.
Mr Graham Miller, operations director, William Younger &amp; Co., and
president of the Freight Transport Association, also emphasised the
importance of transport infrastructure, saying: ''It provides the means
by which our economy thrives and it frees us to use our leisure time on
a wider variety of pursuits.''
He called for continuing investment in infrastructure to remove
bottlenecks.

<HEADLINE>#100m damage during jets servicing which 'could have cost lives'</HEADLINE>

A #7m DEAL to have a squadron of the RAF's frontline Tornado fighter
aircraft serviced on the cheap resulted in #100m worth of damage by an
outside contractor and could have cost lives, a House of Commons
watchdog group disclosed esterday.
Now the taxpayer faces a bill for repairs by British Aerospace, the
company undercut by #4m in the bidding for the original contract.
Calling yesterday for an urgent review of the Defence Ministry's
quality control techniques, the all-party Defence Select Committee said
the damage to the jets was discovered purely by ''a fortunate accident''
when a sharp-eyed RAF technician examined the aircraft when they were
returned to squadron duty.
Liberal Democrat Defence spokesman Menzies Campbell, a member of the
committee, said last night:''This is yet another example of of the
failure of management of the MoD. Anyone with any sense knows that the
cheapest deal is not always the best deal.
''Inadequate supervision of contracts of this kind not only costs
money, but could have cost lives.''
The contract for servicing the 16 F3 Tornados was won by the Dorset
firm of Airwork Ltd, now a part of Short Brothers, in 1993. Repair work
by BAe was authorised earlier this year.
The Select Committee report on the incident, published yesterday,
says: ''We are astonished that MoD accepted back the aircraft and paid
for the 'work' undertaken on eight of them solely on the basis of
Airwork's documentation, showing that it had carried out the work
correctly.
''The discovery by the MoD that this was far from true appears to have
been a fortunate accident -- an RAF technician noticed some damage --
rather than by any planned inspection.
''This deplorable incident should be a salutary and timely lesson
about the risks inherent in contracting out such work. Contracts must be
effectively monitored and supervised at all times.''
The committee added that it would be ''monstrous'' if the taxpayer
ended up out of pocket for the debacle. It was also ''highly fortunate''
that the aircraft type was the Tornado, as there were still sufficient
numbers to meet defence needs until the damaged jets could be repaired.
Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark said:''The MoD's handling of
its contractorisation programme has been characterised by incompetence
and ineptitude.   ''This farce demonstrates many of the risks of
contracting out some vital defence roles to the private sector.''
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment last night.

It could mean a new job for me and a lot like me. Now there's hope for
the future for many people
Scott Easton
FOR the first time since the former Ravenscraig steelworks closed in
1992, the people of Motherwell had something to smile about yesterday.
Mr Scott Easton, 23, from Motherwell, worked at Ravenscraig with an
industrial cleaning services agency until 1992. He is now unemployed but
has already put in his bid to switch on to Chunghwa.
He said: ''I have applied for a job at Chunghwa. If there are going to
be 3000 jobs then that's great.
''It could mean a new job for me and a lot like me. Now there's hope
for the future for many people. Everyone here can't stop talking about
it.''
Mr Kenny McCarron, 19, from Motherwell, unemployed, said he was
delighted with the announcement.
He said: ''I didn't know anything about this until I saw it on TV. I
just live two minutes away from Mossend. Motherwell has really hit the
dumps so much I don't even like staying here anymore.
''Now I hope this factory changes all that and makes a really big
difference. Hundreds have already applied for jobs and so will thousands
of others.''
Ms Andrea Carty, 33, from Motherwell, a shop manageress, said:
''Ravenscraig closing was just devastating. A lot of the shops went down
when it shut. It will be brilliant if most of the local community get
jobs.
''We're looking forward to trade picking up once more, thanks to
Mossend.''
It is hoped that the factory will be completed in 1999, giving it a
capacity of 10 million tubes per year. The first phase of the project is
expected to be completed by 1997, by which time 1200 people are expected
to be employed.
Chunghwa employes 12,000 staff world-wide in plants in Taiwan,
Malaysia, and China, but this is its first investment in Europe.
Councillor Harry McGuigan, Labour group leader of Motherwell District
Council, said: ''This is not just an investment for Motherwell. This is
clearly a large investment for Lanarkshire and Scotland.
''And one of the factors in that has been the flexibility of the
workforce.'' More jobs are expected to be created in spin-off industries
from the project.
Chunghwa, a subsidiary of Tatung, says that many of the initial
recruits will be trained in Taiwan or Malaysia, where the company has
four other factories.
But for the old guard who worked shoulder to shoulder at the old
steelworks the jobs boom comes too late.
Mr James Kelly, 46, from Motherwell, said: ''It won't make any
difference to me.''
Mr Ian Simmons, 51, a former fitter at Ravenscraig, said: ''This has
all come too late for me. Hopefully it will make a difference for my
laddie. Ravenscraig was the life blood around here. It was the heart of
Motherwell. I hope Mossend will turn out to be our new heart.''

CHRIS STONE, City Editor, reports from the CBI conference.
GOVERNMENT Ministers yesterday launched a counter-attack following
Labour leader Tony Blair's favourable reception at the CBI annual
conference in Birmingham.
Both the President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang and Heritage
Secretary Virginia Bottomley singled out the European Social Chapter and
a minimum wage as the most vulnerable part of Mr Blair's agenda, and one
on which industrial leaders have expressed the most concern.
Mrs Bottomley, speaking in a CBI conference session on tourism, said a
minimum wage would cost 1.8 million jobs across the country while Mr
Lang, in attacking both Labour's plans for a minimum wage and support
for the Social Chapter, warned of a return to union militancy if it won
power.
However, the CBI declared its intention to remain politically neutral
in the run-up to the next General Election, despite a Government plea
for support.
Mr Lang dismissed Labour's efforts to woo the business world as
''vaporous outpourings'' and said its interests were best served by the
Tories.
However, CBI president Sir Bryan Nicholson made it clear that the
organisation would not take sides.
''The important point is that the CBI should support policies that are
appropriate to business,'' Sir Bryan said at the end of the conference.
Earlier, Mr Lang denied at a news conference that Tory leaders were
letting Mr Blair set the agenda. He said that he would expect CBI to
come out in support of the Conservatives.
In his speech to the conference, he argued that a flexible labour
market was the cornerstone of economic success.
He said that ''industry must be able to respond quickly to the
competitive challenge. A flexible labour market helps to create jobs and
improve productivity.''
He continued: ''It was to create such a market that we curbed union
power, reformed our industrial relations laws and state ownership made
way for privatisation -- leading to a labour market that has become more
efficient in providing jobs, in raising living standards and in
maintaining competitiveness.''
On the minimum wage, the Minister said this was not a panacea for low
pay. He said it would open the door to disputes over wage increases as
workers and unions fought to restore differentials.
He claimed that it would push up prices as suppliers sought to
compensate for increases in costs. ''Increased costs without improved
productivity mean lost competitiveness. And lost competitiveness means
lost jobs.''
Attacking the Social Chapter, Mr Lang countered Mr Blair's argument
that this was just a set of principles.
It was part of a solemn and binding treaty. ''It would inexorably lead
to detailed legislation.'' The Minister said that those who wanted to
sign the Social Chapter failed to understand that, in doing so, the UK
would lose the chance of saying ''No'' to proposals for damaging
legislation imposed by qualified majority voting.
''It is no good saying therefore that each piece of legislation will
be judged on its merits.''
Raising the threat of renewed trade union militancy, the Minister
said: ''There are discouraging signs that some trade unions still hanker
after the failed laws of the past. They want forced union recognition to
help them to recruit. They refuse to act like business -- to demonstrate
to employers and employees why they add value.''
Mrs Bottomley told the conference that it was vital that Britain
resisted measures that would do immeasurable damage to the tourist
industry's chances of generating wealth and creating jobs.
The Social Chapter, she said, was a prime example: ''a more efficient
device for increasing unemployment is hard to imagine.''
She continued: ''Just consider what it would entail. The part-time
work directive. The parental leave directive. The works council
directive. All guaranteed to increase costs, reduce competitiveness, and
destroy jobs. And they threaten to cost our companies #2000m every
year.''
When the tourist industry was seeking to recapture market share, the
Social Chapter would reduce that share and give British jobs to others,
said the Heritage Secretary.
On the minimum wage, she said that while everyone accepted the need
for measures to combat poverty, that would not be achieved by specifying
wages employers could not afford and workers would not receive without
their jobs or those of their colleagues being sacrificed.
''That would not be compassionate or caring, but a cruel deception of
the young, the unskilled and the unemployed.
A minimum wage of #4.15 an hour is plain bad economics, and could cost
up to 1.8m jobs across the economy as a whole.''

<RECORDNO>975372430</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WATER bailiff said there was no hook on the line when he was caught
fishing on a salmon river, an industrial tribual in Inverness was told
yesterday.
Mr Andrew Thomson, 31, of Tomdoun, Invergarry, was dismissed after the
incident on the River Garry.
He told officials from Ness District Fishery Board that he had been
testing the rod. He said the end of the line had either a piece of wool
or a fly with no hook.
The board decided that Mr Thomson was lying, and dismissed him from
the job which he had held for five years.
Board chairman Douglas Keith, 50, a company director who owns the
fishing on the nearby River Oich said: ''He was in breach of the law and
River Garry regulations.''
The matter had come to light when the new owner of the River Garry, Mr
Paul Williamson from Norfolk, found a day permit had been issued to a Mr
Dennis MacKay, but Mr Thomson was fishing with him.
Mr Keith said: ''Two people were fishing on a single ticket, one of
them our own bailiff. It was a very serious matter.''
He said that Mr Thomson changed his explanation, and claimed he might
inadverently have fished simultaneously with Mr MacKay when both were
out of sight of each other.
Mr Thomson's lawyer, Mr Victor Tough, said that, three months after
the alleged poaching incident, the board had sent Mr Thomson a letter
summoning him to explain an incident on the River Moriston, and not the
River Garry.
Mr Keith said that the board's clerk, lawyer Fred Kelly, must have got
''a bit confused'' when dictating the letter.
Mr Williamson, 30, said he visited the river with his wife and,
unseen, watched Mr Thomson fishing with Mr MacKay before introducing
himself to the bailiff.
Mr Williamson told the tribunal: ''Mr Thomson went bright red. I did
not say anything at the time, as I was uncertain about the background
and facts.
''But I was concerned that the first time I met the river policeman,
the very person you should be able to rely on, he was fishing
illegally.''
Mr Thomson is claiming unfair dismissal. The tribunal was adjourned to
a later date.

STAGECOACH appears to have failed in two bids to extend its burgeoning
bus empire into running trains. It seems likely that the first train
operators' franchises under rail privatisation will go to management
buy-out teams.
That is certainly the view of shipping company Sea Containers, which
yesterday pulled out of the race and condemned the privatisation
process.
It warned of a ''deteriorating network,'' due to lack of investment,
and said it would not wish to operate in such an environment.
Sea Containers claimed that only management buy-out teams are likely
to win the seven-year franchises because ''the Government really only
wants the network to be managed for the primary benefit of Railtrack and
rolling stock-owning companies which are being sold to private
investors''.
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said the comments were
more proof that rail privatisation would be a disaster, and called on
the Government to stop the sales ''before any more damage is done''.
But he was far from disappointed that Stagecoach had failed in bids to
run services on the Great Western and LTS (London, Tilbury and Southend)
lines. He said: ''I think it would be very dangerous to have a local bus
monopoloy -- and an inter-modal monopoly -- in any part of the
country.''
Stagecoach was recently criticised by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission for ''deplorable'' activities in Darlington, and blamed for
the collapse of a municipal bus company in the town.
Stagecoach, which is still in the running for South West Trains,
declined to comment yesterday on its failure to reach the shortleet for
Great Western and LTS.
An spokesman for the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, which is
responsible for sales, emphasised that the bidding process was rigourous
in maintaining ''a fair competition in which all bidders are given equal
information''.
Sea Containers president Mr James Sherwood yesterday announced the
company ''would not be proceeding with franchises to operate parts of
British Rail''.
He added: ''The British Government has refused to offer franchise
periods long enough to justify capital investment, and without such
investment we can only see a deteriorating rail network which would not
be an environment in which we would wish to operate.''
The franchise awards are expected to be announced next month, and it
is understood only a management buy-out team now remains for the LTS
franchise.

Strasbourg
PRIME Minister John Major's campaign against European Union fraud
received an embarrassing setback yesterday when the EU's Court of
Auditors named Britain as one of the countries most at fault in managing
community funds.
Reporting that blatant dishonesty cost the European taxpayer #400m
last year, the auditors chose the lack of accounting in Scotland to show
how the British Government had failed to meet its responsibilities.
The total figure for losses to the European taxpayer could be almost
#2bn, if money properly spent but inadequately accounted for is
included.
The auditors' huge report was accompanied by a second bulky document
giving a more detailed account of how money had gone missing. It placed
the blame for losses and mismanagement mainly on the community's member
states who are responsible for 80% of all EU spending.
The EU's financial watchdogs in the court complained that it was
impossible to check certain items of agricultural spending amounting to
#200m in Britain because ''no information at all'' had been sent by the
British authorities.
They also noted that it was impossible to reconcile spending #82m on
the ewe premium in Scotland and Northern Ireland ''because the national
authorities had not supplied all the requisite information''.
In addition, #21m had to be excluded from the audit of spending in
Scotland, mainly on aid for cultivation of land, because magnetic tapes
sent to the court were not complete.
Moreover, said the auditors, they could also not audit spending
amounting to #88m in the five-year farming set-aside scheme for land
being taken out of production, and dairy product area, because it had
received no word from the British authorities.
British officials last night issued a statement in Strasbourg -- where
the European Parliament is in plenary -- saying they had been unable to
meet the deadline for providing detailed information on magnetic tape in
the specific format laid down by the court.
They added: ''The relevant payments were, however, subject to the
normal control checks operating in the UK. We have agreed with the court
the information to be provided in future.''
But Opposition MPs pounced on the court's selection of Britain, along
with Denmark and Spain, as sinners in the fraud debate. Shadow Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook accused the Government of failing to take effective
action to tackle fraudulent and wasteful use of EU finances.
''The Government must accept its share of the blame instead of
pointing an accusing finger at Brussels. Instead of taking the lead the
Government has blocked measures to improve anti-fraud work by the EU and
has failed to insist on fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy budget which accounts for most fraud,'' he said.
Mr Cook accused the Tories of ''playing to the gallery of right-wing
opinion instead of defending British taxpayers''.
Mr Andre Middelhoek, president of the court, complained that the
auditors had been unable to obtain information in ''a number of areas''.
Referring to Britain and the other two offending states, he said: ''It
is to be hoped that all responsible authorities will act rapidly to
eliminate such obstacles to the court's work.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday described the #260m
investment by the Taiwanese company Chunghwa as ''excellent news for
Lanarkshire and Scotland''.
The firm is bringing a record 3300 jobs to work-starved Lanarkshire
over the next five years through its construction of a massive
custom-built factory at Mossend to manufacture tubes for computer
monitors and televisions.
The deal is believed to include an #80m package of Government and
local incentives.
Mr Forsyth said: ''This is the largest inward investment project ever
attracted to the UK. It is also, I know, by far the largest investment
in Europe by a Taiwanese company.''
Development agencies believe that Taiwan has the scope to make further
investment in Scotland and hope that other Taiwanese companies will
follow the example of Chunghwa, which is a subsidiary of Tatung.
Attempts to attract other computer monitor manufacturers to Scotland
have failed in the past because they had no access to a tube
manufacturer. Now that Chunghwa has remedied this situation, it is hoped
that new investment in other spheres of the electronics industry will
follow.
Mr Brian Cole, head of the Asia Pacific desk in Locate In Scotland,
the agency which did the bulk of the negotiations, said last night that
the jobs offered would be ''quality'' jobs.
''These are not typical assembly-line jobs. They will need people who
can fix machines and who have engineering skills,'' he said.
The first phase of the operation is expected to be up and running by
mid-1997, but recruitment will begin before then. Much of the training
will be carried out in Lanarkshire, but some recruits will be invited to
Taiwan and Malaysia for additional training and the opportunity to
observe Chunghwa's production lines there.
Initially, it is expected that around 1200 people will be employed. Of
these, around 900 will work in production in what will be a heavily
automated workplace operating three eight-hour shifts of 300 people
round-the-clock.
The project was won by Locate In Scotland, the joint Scottish
Office/Scottish Enterprise inward investment agency, in the face of
fierce competition from Ireland and France in Europe, and South Wales
within the UK.
The Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau also
co-operated, and Lanarkshire Development Agency played a key role in
putting together a local training and services package.
The company chose a 90-acre Enterprise Zone site close to the
Eurocentral Rail Freight Terminal at Mossend, which is currently being
cleared by Lanarkshire Development Agency to allow the 1.2million sq ft
factory to be built.
When completed in around four years, the plant is expected to be the
most automated and technically advanced in the world. It will house six
production lines with a production capacity of 10 million tubes per
year.
Mr Charles Yu, Chunghwa's European manufacturing director, said:
''Chunghwa may not be a well-known company in the UK, but it is a major
company with sales in 1995 budgeted at $1bn, and growing rapidly. We
employ 12,000 staff worldwide in plants in Taiwan, Malaysia, and China,
but this announcement is our first investment in Europe.
''We chose Scotland as the location for the plant because of its
position at the centre of the European electronics industry, the
availability of a quality workforce with the requisite skills, and an
excellent site which matched our needs superbly.''
Mr Forsyth said that Chunghwa's decision had reinforced Scotland's
position as one of the most competitive European business locations.
''Scotland was favoured due to the impressive locational package we
were able to offer the company -- a high quality, highly skilled
workforce, non-wage labour costs which are among the lowest in Europe,
one of the lowest rates of corporation tax, and a site which will give
the company direct access to customers in the heart of Europe,'' he
said.
Mr Forsyth added: ''The project will provide a massive jobs boost for
Lanarkshire -- enabling it to finally put behind it the closure of
Ravenscraig and to look to the future with renewed confidence.
Ravenscraig is the past -- this is the future. We are moving on.''
Mr George Kynoch, Scottish Industry Minister who was closely involved
in the negotiations, said that Scotland already produced 12% of Europe's
semi-conductors, more than 35% of Europe's personal computers; more than
50% of Europe's automated banking machines; and more than 60% of
Europe's workstations.
Mr Ian Livingstone, chairman of Lanarkshire Development Agency, said:
''I am confident that the Chunghwa facility will act as a magnet,
attracting further jobs and investment to Lanarkshire. We are now on the
threshold of a dynamic post-steel economy which will see Lanarkshire
established as the new manufacturing powerhouse of Scotland.''
The Labour MP for Motherwell, Dr John Reid, said: ''We have gone
through the trauma of steel closures and there is still some way to go
in the regeneration of Lanarkshire. But I believe that we can now start
looking forward rather than back. Today really does mark a new
beginning.''
STUC assistant secretary Richard Leonard said: ''This is, of course,
good news for Scotland. But the Government should not think that it is
the invisible hand of the market which has made this happen, but the
visible hand of the public sector, including local authorities.''
The 3300 skilled engineering and technical jobs amount to the biggest
employment bonanza in British history, outstripping the 3000 jobs set to
be created respectively by Samsung and by Siemens in the North-east of
England.
Last year, 97 inward investment projects were announced for Scotland,
involving planned investment of more than #1bn, creating or safeguarding
more than 12,300 jobs. The Finnish company Nokia is known to be
considering Lanarkshire for a cellular phone factory which would employ
700.
At the end of yesterday's announcement, Mr Eugene Chien, London
director of the Taipei Representative Office, said: ''The partnership
between Chunghwa and Scotland seems a match made in heaven. As Humphrey
Bogart said, this could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship.''

With 14 developments north of the Border and plans for a further
eight, Tilbury Douglas is one of Scotland's most active developers
builders. Recently the company opened new showhomes in Ayr, Cumbernauld,
Glen rothes, Livingston, and Troon.
The builder's homes feature 17 different house styles which include a
range of window types, a variety of brick designs, and other distinctive
features such as cornerstones, rendering, and pediments.
Since homebuyers have a very wide choice nowadays, Tilbury aims to
make purchasing a new house as simple and stress-free as possible.
For example, at the company's Wallace Glen development in Stirling -
and its Heathfield development in Ayr - homebuyers are being given #4000
vouchers to be spent at Reid Furniture.
Jan Jeram, Tilbury Douglas' marketing director, says: ''It is our
policy to make it as easy as possible for people to purchase one of our
houses and with this offer they can treat themselves to furniture for
their new home.''
Currently there are Tilbury developments in Airdrie, Ayr, Baillieston,
Beith, Cumbernauld, Falkirk, Glenrothes, Johnstone, Law, Livingston,
Paisley, Stirling, Strathaven and Troon.
The company has plans for developments in Baillieston, Coatbridge,
Edinburgh, Renfrew, Wishaw and second developments in Airdrie, Johnstone
and Paisley.

THERE'S no doubt about it: letting is proving increasingly popular
throughout Scotland. Take the views of Tony Kopsch, senior man with
General Accident Property Services, as he surveys both sides of the
country.
Glasgow and Edinburgh alike are experiencing greater demand, he finds,
from company personnel relocating into Strathclyde or Lothian
respectively. And the demand from professionals and young couples is
strong and consistent.
Student demand may well be seen as essentially seasonal, but demand
always outstrips supply and this is one sector that can be expected to
remain strong.
The greatest area of change over the past year, Tony reckons, is in
the number of houseowners who would never have thought of renting out
their properties. With a dull market making for difficulties in selling,
or simply with circumstances stipulating th e need for an actual move,
rental has come to the fore.
Now, he adds, home owners who have been lucky enough to sell
properties are looking to rent for six months or longer. This is to give
them enough time to find a new home. It means test and try, before you
buy. Try out an area, schools, shops or whatever, without a long-term
commitment and a possibly expensive mistake.
Looking at the main changes in the market, Tony picks out an increased
supply of the popular three-four bedroom houses as helping to stabilise
rent levels. Allied to this, more agents coming in to the letting sector
helps both landlords and tenants - competition keeps fee levels down,
and rent levels relatively stable.
With a good spread of clients, and customers, GA's views on the
country-versus-city question are worth considering. The general
situation, Tony Kopsch finds, is that the bulk of demand remains to be
close to the main centres of population, and close to the workplace
where possible.
With a growth in electronics and computing services, for example,
there has been a demand in West Lothian which can often outstrip supply.
Small country cottages are always a popular item. The larger country
houses remain attractive where they are not too far from motorway
access.
In broad terms, he points out, you get more for your money with a
country property. The only penalty as such as having slightly longer
commuting times. With what seems to be an increasing number of tenants
relocating from the Home Counties - and quite used to serious commuting
times in the South - this is less of a problem than could otherwise
appear.
Look at sample properties on the GA list. There is a nice old country
house at Braco, near Dunblane, originally a traditional farmhouse and
steading. It comes with three reception rooms, master bedroom with en
suite dressing room and bathroom, three other bedrooms, and bathroom,
kitchen, utility room and conservatory. Plus an acre of ground. Ready at
#1500 a month.
It's the same price for a nice country property over by Dunlop in
Ayrshire, B-listed and in a conservation area. Linked to a TV
personality, as it happens. Bow-ended drawing room, hall, sitting room,
dining room, conservatory, kitchen, cloakroom and utility room.
Three bedrooms, bathroom and sitting room on the first floor. Three
more bedrooms and bathroom on the second floor. Just under an acre of
ground, and two greenhouses. Handy for the golfing, of course.

ALL good things must come to an end, and the success story that has
been Henderland Gate is into its last chapter. The extremely popular,
award-winning development in Bearsden is due for completion in the
spring and, thanks to the huge demand for the luxury flats and villas,
this is really the last chance to stake your claim.
You'd better be quick, for though the six houses remaining are at the
tail end of the project, they are most certainly not what could be
termed the left-overs.
''The six houses remaining are in a splendid location at the top of
the development, which is set in tranquil surroundings just off the
Switchback,'' said David Nelson, managing director of developers Adam
Homes, announcing the release of Henderland Gate's final phase.
''Situated on one side of a cul de sac, with no houses opposite, they
will enjoy a commanding position overlooking the rest of the site, with
uninterrupted views right down the Clyde estuary.
''The six houses back on to woodlands, which obviously gives them the
added benefit of a very private garden.''
The homes are a mix of the company's exclusive four and five-bedroom
detached villas and all will be built to the same high specification and
standard that won Adam Homes' site manager, James Harkins, two
prestigious NHBC awards in this year's Pride in the Job competition,
established to foster quality construction and reward commitment to
quality workmanship.
As well as winning a quality award in the summer, James beat off
competition from all over Scotland to win a Seal of Excellence in the
recent regional finals.
To industry insiders, that achievement means he excels at overseeing
every aspect of new-house construction and man management at the
Bearsden site and, more importantly, to the housebuyer it means Adam
homes not only look good but are built to the highest technical
standards.
His success underlined what owners and potential buyers have been
saying all year about Henderland Gate, which comprised a range of two
and three-bedroom flats (28 in all) and 15 four and five-bedroom
detached homes.
Now the site is coming to an end.
''There are only five flats left in the final phase of 14 flats so,
again, time is running out for potential buyers.
''One reason for the continued popularity is the amount of space in
these flats and houses,'' said David Nelson. ''In the five-bedroom
house, for example, even the fifth bedroom can take a double bed, and
all the kitchens - even those in the flats - have been designed to take
a table for dining. All of the flats have balconies leading off from the
lounge, most with a view.''
Each flat is supplied with satellite television, and there is an
aerial point in every room. The villas have living-flame fires and
patios leading to the gardens, and the developers offer a carpets and
curtains package.
Henderland Gate is close to shopping and transport facilities as well
as being within easy reach of the city centre. Prices are from #98,000
for a two-bedroom flat and from #198,000 for the Braemar four-bedroom
detached villa.
''We are delighted the way the site has progressed,'' said David
Nelson. ''Not only has it proved to be popular from the sales point of
view, but in winning the NHBC awards the site has been recognised by the
building industry.
''Well over half of the site will be occupied by Christmas and the
second and final phase of flats is due for completion in early spring,
with the final phase of houses due for completion in late spring.
''With only five flats and six houses remaining, potential buyers had
better move quickly.''

While it is nice to be able to get away from it all, it is usually
important to be able to get back as quickly as possible. With its ready
acess to Edinburgh, Perth and even Glasgow, Kinross-shire is attracting
people who want to live in the country but require fast road links to
the rest of the country.
Tillyochie House by Kinross is a fine period country home, situated
amid 14 acres of gardens and policies. Edinburgh is only 28 miles
distant and Glasgow is 45 miles via the Kincardine Bridge.
The opportunities available nearby include trout fishing at Loch
Leven, curling and golfing. Gleneagles Hotel, with its golf course and
leisure facilities, is within a 25-minute drive.
Tillyochie House retains many attractive features and offers the
following accommodation: drawing room, dining room, sitting room,
playroom, breakfasting kitchen with larder and pantry, utility room,
master bedroom, with bathroom and dressing room, five or six further
bedrooms, three bathrooms.
The grounds include extensive areas of lawn, bordered by mature mixed
woodland. Further woodland plantings have been carried out.
The Edinburgh-based joint agents, Langley-Taylor and Strutt &amp; Parker,
are seeking offers in excess of #325,000.

WORRY about being unable to sell their current home is one of the
major barriers when people are considering purchasing a new house.
Nobody wants to be caught having bought, only to find that they can't
sell - or that their home does not achieve the price they had hoped for.
West of Scotland housebuilder Ambion Homes is targeting those worried
would-be buyers with AIM - its Assistance in Moving scheme.
''The only stumbling block for our potential purchasers is the fear of
being unable to sell their current home,'' says sales manager Irene
Martin. ''So AIM is designed to take the worry and expense out of
selling our purchasers' existing homes. And it is available at every one
of our developments.''
At Westerlands in Newton Mearns, the company is building 10 different
house styles and has opened two showhomes.
At Bearsden and Milngavie, Ambion is selling detached homes with four
bedrooms at less than #110,000.
But good prices and locations are not enough to revive the housing
market. Only the Government can bring back confidence. ''Some serious
intervention is needed,'' says Irene Martin. ''We're all hoping to see
some action in the Budget. Not just tinkering - like the previous
suspension of stamp duty, which did no good at all.
''The stamp duty threshold should be increased significantly and
permanently. Mortgage tax relief should be reinstated to where it was
three years ago.''

The specialist retirement housing sector appears to be expanding
again. As part of a #15m expansion programme in Scotland, McCarthy &amp;
Stone has submitted plans for developments at Newton Mearns and Bearsden
.
The Newton Mearns development comprises 27 flats to replace the old
Broomburn Garage, while at Bearsden a #2.4m building is proposed on the
site of a house and its grounds in Gartconnel Drive.
The programme - which also embraces projects at Edinburgh and
Stirlingshire - has been prompted by an increased demand for retirement
housing in Scotland.
Alan Gosland, managing director of McCarthy &amp; Stone Scotland,
described the location of both sites in Strathclyde as ideal for
retirement living.
''Newton Mearns is a prime site in a good residential area with good
shopping just across the road. The Bearsden development will be our
first in the town, but we have built twice before in Milngavie, where
Fairview Court became one of our most successful projects. All the
evidence suggests there is a need in these areas for the type of housing
in which we specialise.''
Each development will include a house manager, a residents' lounge and
a Careline emergency system - with panic buttons monitored around the
clock in each of the flats.
Security is a key feature of the developments. A video camera at the
main entrance can be activated by any resident, simply by changing
channels on their TV set.
The first residents are expected to arrive at each site in autumn
1996. Guide prices will be announced next year.
Another McCarthy &amp; Stone development, The Cedars at Corstophine,
Edinburgh, recently claimed a record in the company's 18-year history
when all but two of the flats were sold or reserved before it opened.
Further sites will come on stream as the company, which is Britain's
largest retirement housebuilder, steps up its policy of land
acquisition.

A Welsh-based builder has launched showhouses in a Scottish style.
Redrow's site at Kittoch Muir in East Kilbride contains the company's St
Monance and Culross house styles, which have been decorated and
furnished by Redrow's in house designers who are responsible for 150
show home interiors each year in the UK Redrow aims to reflect the
character and location of each of the areas in which it is building new
homes.
John Anderson, regional director of Redrow Homes (Scotland), said:
''We are delighted to be able to show off our new homes at last.
Interest in the development has been very keen since we won the design
competition run by East Kilbride Development Corpora tion 12 months ago.
Our show houses have a reputation for style and attention to detail and
we hope that Scottish customers will be suitably impressed.''
The Kittoch Muir development, off Stewartfield Way, features a
selection of 3 and 4 bedroom detached properties with garages and
en-suites with the master bedrooms, currently priced from #104,950 to
#135,000 The Culross house has the extra luxury of two en-suite bath and
shower rooms in addition to the family bathroom . Its ground floor
accommodation includes separate lounge and dining room , study, kitchen
with breakfast area , utility room and downstairs c loakroom.
The St Monance style has similar attributes and the same level of
specification, including gas central heating, double glazing, fitted
kitchen with built in oven, hob, cooker hood, fridge freezer and
dishwasher, and Victorian style bathroom with traditio nal white suite.
''Internally these homes match the high standards set by our
established Heritage Range, while externally they have been specially
designed for the local market with white render and traditional slate
look roof finishes,'' says John Anderson.
''Conscientous landscaping of the development will include a tree
lined avenue leading to an existing motte and dry stone walling' The
company has just acquired a site at Dalgety Bay in Fife and is now
looking for further land acquisitions in Scotland. The Dalgety Bay site,
which is off Harbour Drive, will see building wor start early next year.

MINER'S son William Cowie will relive the happiest days of his life
when he moves to a new home on the site of the former miners row
cottages where he spent his childhood.
The former mining village of Annathill, a hamlet at the foot of the
Campsie Hills, is being transformed by Taywood Homes with a delightful
development of two and three-bedroom detached bungalows.
William, who is 59, was born and lived for nearly three decades in the
two-room cottage in the hamlet, which was home to more than 400 people.
''There were three rows, stretching about 200 yards, and we lived in
the first one - No,1 Annathill,'' recalls William, who followed his
father into Bedlay Colliery as an electrical engineer.
''It was a good community of nice people, most of them miners. It was
a great time in my life. Everyone knew each other, and we were always in
and out of everybody's houses.
''It was the kind of place where people could leave their doors open.
We didn't have alarm clocks because we knew someone would chap on the
shutters in the morning if we overslept. Times were hard for all of us,
but everybody pulled together. I have very happy memories of those
days.''
When a renovation programme was announced for the Annathill miners
rows 33 years ago, the Cowie family moved to Glenboig, and the community
was scattered across Central Scotland.
But when the programme of work fell through, William and his young
bride, Cathie, moved back to Annathill to a cottage in the second row.
And that is where two of their sons, Gordon and Colin were born.
''We lived there for four happy years, but then the pit closed and the
houses were finally demolished,'' William explains. ''We were the last
to leave. It was a very sad time for us, and all the families who had
lived there felt the same.
''We then moved back to Glenboig, where our youngest son Alan was
born, but I always yearned to go back to my roots.'' Though William and
Cathie had lived in their Glenboig home for 25 years, they jumped at the
chance to return to the area they will always think of as home.
Just as they had been last to leave the miners rows a quarter of a
century ago, the Cowies were the first customers to reserve a Taywood
Homes house on the Campsie View development, and a week today, William
will move back to Annathill for the third time.
He says: ''Cathie, Gordon and Colin all have happy memories of
Annathill in the old days. Alan will be moving there for the first time
and it's nice to think he will be able to make his own memories. I hope
he'll be as happy as we were.
''I'm still in touch with friends from the original miners row
cottages and most of them wish they had the chance to move back to
Annathill, too. We all agree that we should never have left in the first
place. It's where we belong.''
The Cowies have reserved an Oakwood, a two-bedroom detached bungalow,
in a choice position on the site. To celebrate the opening of Campsie
View and the fact that Mr and Mrs Cowie were the first purchasers,
Taywood Homes have agreed to carpet their #59,000 house as a gift.
Overlooking the Campsie Hills, the development enjoys a rural
environment only three miles from the shopping and sporting facilities
in Cumbernauld.
The site is a 20-minute drive from Glasgow city centre and a
five-minute drive from the M80. It is within easy reach of Edinburgh via
the M8, and the South via the M73 and M74.
Prices at Campsie View start at #67,950 for the Laxford, a distinctive
two-bedroom home with en-suite shower room unit. The three-bedroom
Etive, at #74,450, with en-suite shower room and a garage, combines
traditional styling with practical use of light and space. The Rosewood,
at #78,450, is a three-bedroom family home with well-planned
accommodation including an en-suite shower room and a garage.
Special offers are available at Taywood Homes'' Campsie View
development for a limited period. A showhome is open Thursday to Monday,
from 10am to 5pm.

A TEENAGE girl made legal history yesterday when she became the first
person in Scotland to be sentenced to detention for making a falserape
accusation.
Caroline McKinlay, 18, admitted wasting police time by causing
officers to search for her alleged attacker and rendering him open to
suspicion and accusation of rape.
Sentencing her to three months' detention, Dumbarton Sheriff John
Fitzsimons said it was one of the most difficult cases he had ever dealt
with.
He told McKinlay: ''Rape is one of the most serious crimes in the
book. Therefore pretending that someone has perpetrated it must be
treated very seriously as well.''
The court was told that McKinlay was found lying naked from the waist
down on a roadside verge near the Clyde Submarine Base at Faslane,
Dunbartonshire.
She was taken to Vale of Leven Hospital where she claimed a man called
Alex from Drumchapel had taken her out for a drink, then forced her to
have sex in his car before dumping her in remote Glen Fruin.
She repeated the claims at Dumbarton police station, and the alleged
attacker was tracked down and voluntarily appeared for questioning.
He admitted having intercourse with McKinlay but insisted she was a
willing partner.
The man also told officers that the girl had an asthma attack outside
the vehicle after the sex session and panicked because her inhaler was
empty.
He said she refused to calm down and get back into the car so he drove
off without her.
When asked by police why she had lied about what happened in the car,
McKinlay, whose address was given as a hostel in Glasgow, told them: ''I
was happy enough until the sex was all over but later I didn't want it
to have happened.''
Under the terms of the charge, three months was the maximum sentence
available to Sheriff Fitzsimons, who was told by McKinlay that she would
refuse to comply with any probation orders.
He told her: ''I regret having to impose a custodial sentence, but it
is the only course left open to me.
''You don't appear to appreciate the gravity of what you did to this
man and the possible consequences if he had been convicted.
''Nor have you shown the slightest sign of remorse.''
As the sentence was backdated to when she was remanded in custody
eight weeks ago, McKinlay was deemed to have already served the term and
was not detained after the court case.
She refused to comment as she left court and she was believed to be
going to her mother's home in Glasgow.
McKinlay spent some time in France before being brought back to the UK
to face the charges at Dumbarton.
She was to have flown back to Britain via Jersey but tried to dodge
police by failing to make her flight connection from the Channel island.
Eventually she was deported by the authorities in St Helier and banned
from the island for three years for flouting immigration laws.

ROSEMARY WEST, with her perverted obsession with sex and violence, was
the strategist behind the killings at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, it
was claimed yesterday.
''She was involved in violently and sexually abusing the victims,'' Mr
Brian Leveson, QC, prosecuting, declared.
''From the evidence, it is clear she herself intended each of these
girls should die,'' he said in his closing address to the depleted jury
of seven men and four women at Winchester Crown Court.
At the very least she intended serious bodily harm to them to prevent
them going to the police, said Mr Leveson. ''In that case she is guilty
of murder, even if the act which snuffed life out was her husband's. If
she is participating, that is murder.''
Mr Leveson told the jury: ''You may think that, during the course of
the last weeks, we have all, everyone of us, travelled to a place which
plumbs the depths of human depravity. We have been forced to consider
what human beings can do to one another.''
However, he declared that the jury could be sure Rosemary West was
fully involved in the death and mutilations, including that of her own
daughter, Heather.
In court, he said, Mrs West had tearlessly sobbed each time her name
was mentioned.
Mr Leveson declared that, in giving evidence, Mrs West had displayed a
very selective memory concerning these events. She was like the three
''brass monkeys'' -- she saw nothing, heard nothing -- and said nothing.
''This flies in the face of all common sense,'' said Mr Leveson. It was
impossible to mutilate and dispose of the bodies without creating a
bloody mess.
The jury, he said, would have no difficulty in concluding that
Rosemary West was thoroughly dishonest. The Crown was not asking that
she be convicted because the jury disapproved of her morals, or because
she was a lesbian or because there were sex aids in her house.
Nor because, as she contended, she had made one mistake as a girl of
19 by sexually assaulting Caroline Owens.
The Crown was seeking her conviction on the evidence. ''Consider the
evidence,'' he said. ''And what was found at Midland Road -- the remains
of Charmaine, a girl who would not give in to her stepmother.''
Charmaine, the Crown insists, was murdered by Mrs West while her
husband was serving a term of imprisonment. Born in Coatbridge,
Charmaine disappeared in 1971 when aged eight.
Much of what followed could be explained by the Wests' sexual
obsessions. The victims were murdered, he said, for reasons ''we can
hardly imagine''. Sexual gratification was at the forefront of what
happened to them.
Rosemary and Frederick West were a devoted couple, and she was the
strategist in the relationship. Even as a 15-year-old girl, she was
instructing a 20-year-old man on what they would do together -- how they
would live together and get the children out of care.
''This is not the woman who just says 'Yes!''' said Mr Leveson. In the
witness box, Mrs West had proved to be intelligent, tough, and
resourceful.
Unusually, the jury had heard taped evidence from Mr West. This, said
Mr Leveson, was high drama from beyond the grave.
The value of the evidence, the Crown insisted, was absolutely nil.
West told different things to different people. ''He lied, he lied
again, and again and again,'' said Mr Leveson.
West's version in the tapes of an alleged and impossible relationship
with undergraduate Lucy Partington, one of the victims, verged on the
obscene, said Mr Leveson.
For the defence, West was the perfect witness. He was obviously
involved in the killings and he was exonerating Rosemary West.
Most important of all, he could not be cross-examined. His death was
the greatest gift he could give his wife -- and that is exactly what he
said in a letter found after he hanged himself in his cell at Winson
Green Prison, Birmingham, on New Year's Day.
Mr Leveson said that this evidence was obviously worthless and served
only to create smoke. ''Fred West is not on trial -- she is!'' said Mr
Leveson.
Referring to Charmaine, Mr Leveson recalled a letter Rosemary West had
sent her husband in prison.
It declared in part: ''About Cha, I think she likes to be treated
rough. But darling why have I to be the one to do it?''
This, said the Crown counsel, was copper-bottomed evidence -- it did
not depend on anyone's memory.
The jury, he said, might have little difficulty in concluding that
Rosemary West, in treating Charmaine rough, killed her. It may have been
that, on his release, Frederick West buried her remains at 25 Midland
Road.
Referring to the sexual attack on Caroline Owens by both Wests, Mrs
West was asked to explain in the witness box why she had lied to the
police. She responded then: ''It was me putting up my defences.''
Mr Leveson told the jury they might think that was what she had been
doing during these past weeks.
Throughout her life, Anne Marie Davis, Mrs West's stepdaughter, had
been wrapped in tragedy.
In her evidence, Anne Marie had described how she had been taken to a
pub by her stepmother, but later was raped in a van by her father while
Rosemary West looked on and laughed.
''A small window has been opened in the case,'' said Mr Leveson,
referring to Mrs West's diary. ''The window, however, has a clear light
because of her entries.'' In it Mrs West declared how she had taken Anne
Marie to pubs and clubs and ''found fellas''.
This was the clearest evidence of how Rosemary West treated and dealt
with this still young child of 12-and-a-half, he said. ''Frederick and
Rosemary West were playing with their live toy.''
Counsel went through the individual victims, highlighting how
Frederick West must have been left covered in blood and gore. The
clean-up operation alone suggested Rosemary West was involved up to her
neck, he said.
Referring to the death of Shirley Hubbard, who disappeared in 1974
aged 15, Mr Leveson told the jury he would not ask them to look once
more at ''that terrible mask'' which had covered her from the top of the
head to her chin. Inserted in the mask were breathing pipes.
''That is one of the pictures that will perhaps live with each one of
us,'' he told the jury.
Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, defending, makes his concluding address to
the jury today.

A leading east of Scotland estate agent is calling for an abolition of
stamp duty and the continuation of mortgage interest tax relief in the
budget. Scottish house sales will have a quiet winter following a good
autumn period, according to John Brown, d irector for residential sales
at DTZ Debenham Thorpe: ''The hot summer meant more people were
interested in sunbathing rather than looking at houses. However, now
that the summer has ended people are once again out looking.''
Though many housing developments are selling successfully, not all
sectors are selling well. John Brown said: ''New homes are active and
houses or flats in the traditional areas are popular, but out of town is
slow. Generally the second hand housing marke t remains sluggish, with
confidence still being the major factor. The worry, as far as the public
are concerned, is always selling their current home.''
Despite the busy autumn period Brown expects the winter months to be
quiet and anticipates several changes in the residential property market
in 1996.
''A November budget which benefits home owners would undoubtably help
the housing market. I woud like to see stamp duty abolished and tax
relief for mortgage holders continued. I think 1996 will see an increase
in the number of people re-mortgaging their property to a different
society or bank as early fixed offers of loan come to an end.''
DTZ's autumn sales figures reflect the renewed interest with 28
converted flats at College House, Portobello, being reserved within 10
days and a total of 90 Bryant Homes being homes being sold in Edinburgh
alone. Sales covered all ends of the market inc luding the top end where
several Applecross penthouse flats were sold for more than #300,000
Applecross's Grange Hall development opened last month with 75% of the
flats pre-sold. The company's new development of 38 two and three
bedroom flats at Lauriston Gate in Edinburgh will start at the end of
the month.
At Portobello's College House development in Inchview Terrace, all 28
flats in the first phase were reserved within 10 days and demand
outstripped supply by three to one.
The former Ramsay Technical College, an attractive red brick listed
building, was developed by Headon Developments and BVH Developments
(Edinburgh) Ltd.
''The developers got it all right - location, car parking, lift, good
size of flat, quality finishes, and original features,'' says John
Brown.
''Price was also essential for success at College House. Prices range
from #30,000 for a studio, #42,500 for one bedroom and between #53,000
and #75,000 for two bedrooms.''
The former Bruntsfield Hospital in Whitehouse, Edinburgh, is to be
converted into a range of flats by AMA Homes.
Several Victorian buildings will be converted and new flats will be
build on adjacent hospital grounds.
Bruntsfield Hospital was originally purchased by Napier University who
used the Hospital buildings until securing new premises at Craiglockart.
AMA then decided that the former hospital would be a good residential
development.
John Brown said: ''These flats will have a very attractive location
adjacent to Bruntsfield Links, making thim ideal for central facilities
and amenities .''
A total of 28 luxury flats will be developed on the hospital site.
Demolition work is now underway and DTZ expects to market the properties
in March 1996.

Modern architecture gets the blame for much that went wrong in the
redevelopment of the Gorbals during the 1960s and 1970s. But modern
architecture can also enhance the Gorbals, as is graphically
demonstrated by the completion of the first phase of Crown St
Regeneration Project.
A competition to design and build the regeneration project was won in
June 1992 by Holmes Partnership, a Glasgow-based architect and planning
consultancy, in conjunction with Miller Partnerships which is part of
Miller Homes.
The competition was part of a long term #80 million redevelopment of
The Gorbals which aims to create a new urban village on the south side
of the Clyde, comprising 1000 houses as well as shops, a hotel and
business premises. following the demolition of the infamous
''Hutchesontown E ''' flats.
Ballater Gardens consists of three sides of a grid block facing on to
Ballater Street, Laurieston Road and Old Rutherglen Road. A total of 117
flats and maisonettes and three shops have been completed and sold.
House prices range from #33,000 for a one b edroom flat to #52,000 for a
three bedroom maisonette.
The development forms the ''gateway'' into the Crown Street
Regeneration Project area. ''The design re-interprets traditional
tenemental forms in a contemporary way, giving re-assurance of the
familiar without resorting to overt plagiarism of the past,'' say s
Robin Th'ng , managing partner at the Holmes Partnership.
The accomodation is set back from the pavement and raised by one metre
above the ground to increase privacy for ground floor appartments.
This ''privacy strip'' is bridged by entrance porticos which project
from the face of the buildings, signalling points of entry and
punctuating the facade along its length.
The intersection of the crescent and its terrace is celebrated by a
gushet block with a bay window at the corner, capped by a conical roof
and lantern feature. ''The simple geometric shapes at this important
junction creates a landmark which enriches and provides orientation for
the commnity,'' says Robin Th'ng.
The corner block at the junction of Old Rutherglen Road and Laurieston
Road provides shop units at ground floor, behind a covered arcade, and
three upper floors of residential accommodation.
The street frontages are faced in a combination of stone and high
quality facing brick which are used to provide interesting scale and
detail.
Private gardens to the rear of the blocks give acess to a large
communal landscaped area for the enjoyment of all the residents within
the block.
Promoted by Glasgow Development Agency, Scottish Homes, and Glasgow
District Council, the project shows what can be done by joint public and
private partenerships. Future phases of the masterplan should ensure the
completion of the whole Gorbals area by 1997, in time to contribute to
the celebration of Glasgow as the ''City of Architecture and Design'' in
1999.

Scotland's housing market has withstood the recession much more
strongly than most parts of England, which is why some of the leading
builders from south of the border have come north to get a share of the
action.
Bryant Homes is a recent arrival, but has alreafdy staked out the high
ground by opening about half a dozen sites aimed at the upper end of the
market. At Poacher's Knoll in Bearsden, one of the five house styles
available is the Ambassador, a detached house with a wide front, five
bedrooms, lounge, dining room, family room and study. The kitchen has a
separate utility room and the main bedroom has an en-suite dressing area
and en-suite bathroom.
Bryant's most recent development is at King's Manor in Edinburgh and
will offer 20 upmarket homes in three styles, including the Ambassador.
The development is at Mouthooly Loan.
Graeme McCallum of selling agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe said: ''No
development in Edinburgh's south side in the last two years has offered
such spacious accommodation. The homes at King's Manor also benefit from
stunning views, many enjoying outlooks toward s the Pentland Hills.''
Depending on location and house style, Bryant's prices range from
around #65,000 to #225,000.

After doubling its profits this year compared to last, CALA has
announced an ambitious building programme for its Scottish housing
division over the next 12 months. CALA Homes Scotland is poised to start
work on its biggest ever number of new development s north of the
Border. The target calls for almost 700 new homes to be built,
representing turnover of around #70 million.
''This is an expression of our confidence in the Scottish Market,''
says Alan Downie, chairman of CALA Homes Scotland.
''There's no argument that the housing market isn't as strong as the
developers would like it to be, but the Scottish market has held up well
. There's a long way to go before the percentage of homeowners in
Scotland equals the UK average.''
Since achieving sales depends entirely on building the right
development in the right location, the new sites range geographically
from Ayrshire to East Lothian.
The company's range includes bungalows and detached houses in Alloway,
flats and large detached houses in the Newlands area of Glasgow, and
detached houses in Carmunnock. Also in the West of Scotland, CALA is
building flats in Hamilton and two developmen ts in Paisley consisting
of flats and houses. Houses in the east include some split level designs
at Haddington - and two developments of flats and another of mid-sized
houses in Edinburgh.
A new development at Silvermills will comprise a total of 90 one, two
and three bedroom apartments on the edge of Edinburgh's Stockbridge and
New Town areas. ''These flats are designed for the young professional,
or those in the upper age bracket,'' says G ill Gray, CALA's Sales and
Marketing Manager.
''The development has been carefully designed in traditional style to
blend with the existing buildings in the area. The external appearance
will be interesting, since we've used a variety of reconstituted stone,
render, facing brick and slate roofs.'' Pri ces at Silvermills start at
# 62,500.
At Annfield in Stirling CALA is selling both apartments and detached
houses. The apartments start at # 49,000, while the four bedroom houses
cost from #112,000 upwards.
In Perth CALA have built a range of properties in the mid- price range
. The last four bedroom house at Hunters Croft on the northern edge of
town start is priced at #106 000.
Saddlers Mews in Edinburgh's Colinton Road is surrounded by elegant
houses dating back to the turn of the century and has been designed for
the luxury market. The price of the remaining apartment is #173,000.
One of the company's most interesting developments is on the west side
of Scotland. At Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire CALA has rescued Auchenbothie
House, which was built in 1898 in Scots Baronial style, and converted it
into ten flats, each with one or two bedrooms. Large detached houses are
being built inthe grounds. Prices of the flats range from #92,000 and
the houses from #166,000.
Eagle Rise, overlooking Westerwood golf course at Dullatur near
Cumbernauld is strategically placed to take advantage of the central
Scotland motorway network. The range of properties here includes both
bungalows and detached houses. Prices start at #136 ,000 In Glasgow CALA
has 3 developments, all in prime residential areas of the city.
Kirklee Wynde near the Botanic Gardens in Kelvinside, is a development
of upmarket flats where prices start from #94,000.
Waterside Gardens at Bishopbriggs has eight different house styles,
with prices starting at #165,000.
Sherbrooke Gardens in the Pollokshields offers17 excecutive houses
with four or five bedrooms. Prices start from # 217,000.
END PAISLEY -
While CALA has made its name at the upper end of the new homes market,
the company is slipping into a more humble habit at The Priory, in
Paisley.
Recognising that the market for the most expensive house styles is
limited, the company has decided to compete one or two rungs down the
property ladder from its usual more lofty position. While houses at well
over #150,000 will continue to be built on some sites, others (like The
Priory) will contain CALA's new middle range designs which have not
previously been seen in the west of Scotland.
Located off Renfrew Road on the northern side of the town, the site is
less than five minutes from the M8. When complete, the development will
consist of four blocks of flats and 11 detached houses.
The lower price house styles consist of: the Pentland, which has three
bedrooms; and the Kilbreck, the Lomond and the Lawers, each of which
have four. All have gas central heating, double glazing and en suite
shower rooms; the larger properties have sepa rate dining rooms. The
Kilbreck also has a study, and the Lawers has a family room and a double
garage.
The apartments are set in landscaped gardens and have an audio door
entry system, carpeted stairs and landings, and a choice of gas or
electric central heating. Prices at the Priory start from #45,000 for
the apartments and #90,000 for the houses.

If you want to bet on getting the house you want, you need to show
your determination. When Bett homes opened its new sales cabin at
Riverside in Invergowrie, buyers were already queueing up. In fact,
William Docherty from Millbray Gardens in Dundee slep t overnight in his
car to ensure that he could by the one particular home.
His perseverance paid off and he was able to purchase the four bedoom
detached home of his choice. Meanwhile, his new neighbour Ian Dow
arrived early at the site on Saturday morning to qeue at 8 00 am
although the sales cabin wasn't open until 11 00 am.
He also managed to book a four bedroom home. In total, some 16 plots
were reserved over the first weekend.
The new 65 house development will feature three and four bedroom
semi-detached and detached homes, as well as two bedroom flats ranging
from #56,000 to #101,500.
Kareen Davidson, Bett's sales director, said: ''The development is
generating strong local interest despite the fact we haven't advertised
yet . Our showroom will open in the spring, but already we have a lot of
forward sales.''
Meanwhile, Bett Brothers plc, has promoted Kareen Davidson to the
position of sales director.
She now joins the board of Bett Homes. She joined the company as sales
manager last year after eight years with Tilbury Douglas. She is based
in Bett's Dundee headquarters and has responsibility for the company's
sales operations as Bett expands across central Scotland.

TOUGH times need innovative solutions. Builders have responded to the
continuing slow market by wheeling out a wide range of bargains and
incentives to keep their sales going.
But buyers can't expect to find a bargain on every site. Some are
selling well and the builders do not have to dent their margins too much
to attract buyers.
Here are some of the bargains currently on offer in Central Scotland:
* Wilcon Homes is offering savings of up to #20,000 at Doune, near
Callander. One four bedroom detached house which was priced at #109,950
in August has been slashed to #89,950. Another has dropped from #116,950
to #105,000. Each of the reduced prices is subject to 14 day missives.
* Kilsyth-based builders J.B. Bennett is offering free solicitor's
fees, a 3% mortgage cash-back, and free valuation, to buyers. The
company has four current developments - two at Kilsyth, one in
Auchterarder and one in Irvine.
* At Carvill's Admiral's Court development in Gourock, purchasers can
dip their toe into a swimming pool when they take the plunge into buying
an apartment. The developer is throwing in free membership of the
leisure club at a nearby hotel. Prices at Admiral Court start from
#43,250.
* Stirling-based Ogilvie Homes is offering its purchasers the chance
to win a car. Anyone who buys an Ogilvie house before Christmas can
enter the free contest, which includes answering four simple questions
and a tie-breaker. The prize is a new Ford Escort. On some of its
properties Ogilvie is also offering part-exchange, carpets and curtains,
or a cash-back offer.
The company is currently building at Lochwinnoch where four and
five-bedroom detached villas start from #105,000. The firm's other West
of Scotland site is at Westcliffe Court in Anniesland where two-bedroom
apartments start from #51,250.
* Paying your mortgage for a full year is the key incentive offered by
Bellway Homes at some of its developments. The offer is available for
people moving in by 22 December. Bellway's prices range from #48,500 for
two-bedroom cottage flats to over #100,0 00 for four bedroom detached
homes.
Not every builder feels that they have to offer bargains to sell their
schemes. If a particular site is selling quickly they might simply not
bother. As a general rule, the further up the market you go, the less
are the incentives.
Some builders prefer to use their own USP - unique selling point - to
bring the customers into the showhomes.
* Having built a track record of 70 years in central Scotland,
Mactaggart &amp; Mickel relies on its reputation for quality to bring in the
buyers. With several developments on the south side of Glasgow, as well
as in Troon, Ayr and Edinburgh, the company says that it is the
attention to detail which it puts into the interiors - as well as the
locations and the exteriors - which has created its success.
* They say that there are only three things that really count in
property - location, location, and location. St Andrews Square, just off
Glasgow's High Street, offers one of the best locations that a
city-lover could hope for. Right in the historical heart of the city, it
is also within easy reach of the shopping and leisure amenities.
Citylink Developments is selling a variety of apartments, some within
converted historical buildings.
* Housebuilder Adam also relies on finding good locations, then
ensuring that the homes have plenty of space in them. The company's
current development at Henderland Gate just off the Switchback Road
offers large flats and villas on a wooded hillside.
Prices for the flats start at #98,000 while the detached houses cost
from #198,000.
* Tay Homes is sufficiently confident about its product to quietly
shelve some of its incentives. With prices ranging from #23,000 in
Castlemilk to well over #100,000 at Hyndland Gate in Glasgow's West End,
the company has a foothold at each end of the market.
A steady, if unexciting, sales pattern at Hyndland Gate over the last
couple of years has given Tay the confidence to head further upmarket
with the release of three and four-bedroom townhouses priced at between
#149,950 and #180,000.
* Paisley-based Ossian Homes has firmly established itself as a
specialist builder in the mid-market. At Cotton Quay, adjacent to
Meikleriggs Cricket Ground in Paisley, the company is building three and
four bedroom homes from #64,500.

A FAMILY-OWNED Scottish building firm has beaten off opposition from
throughout the UK to win a top housing award. Glasgow-based Mactaggart &amp;
Mickel has won the What Homes? gold award in the Best Luxury Development
category. The building firm collected the award for its Hill Park Pines
development in Edinburgh at a ceremony in London's Dorchester hotel on
Friday afternoon. The upmarket scheme offers prestigious homes priced at
between #350,000 and #450,000.
''We were thrilled on Friday afternoon when we heard that we had
won,'' says Edmund Monaghan of Mactaggart &amp; Mickel. ''Our director,
Bruce Mickel, had drawn up the designs for Hill Park based on the work
of the famous Scottish architect Robert Lorimer.
We see the award as an endorsement of our commitment to quality right
across the board - especially since we recently won a National House
Building Council Seal of Excellence award for our development at
Gilmerton Mews, in Edinburgh, where prices are in the #50,000 to #75,000
range.''
He believes that there is no reason why lower-priced houses should be
built just as well as top of the range developments. ''When we build a
house we do it to the same standards of design, construction materials
and building standards.   ''When you buy a more  expensive house from us
you are simply buying a bigger house - you are paying for more space.
But each of the houses will be as well built as the other.''

AS the autumn leaves start swirling around us, many Scots are tempted
to buy a holiday home in the Spanish sunshine. Choosing a house built
there by a British builder offers the security of dealing in your own
language with a company which has a reputation to maintain at home.
For example, Taylor Woodrow has begun work on two new developments in
Majorca. On the island's eastern coast at Porto Colom, the firm is
creating a small neighbourhood of duplex apartments close to one of the
last traditional Mallorquin fishing harbours.
All 16 apartments at Residencial Porto Colom are on two storeys. On
the upper floor is the main bedroom with en-suite bathroom and large sun
terrace, two other bedrooms and a guest bathroom. On the lower floor
there is a fully fitted kitchen/breakfast room, utility room, downstairs
cloakroom and spacious living and dining areas.
All the apartments face either south or south-west with views across
the landscaped gardens and all have access to a large, private swimming
pool. In addition, each home has double glazing, economy electric night
store heating with remote control, and car parking. Prices range from
#82,500 to #87,500 and pre-sales have just begun.
Residencial Porto Colom is only 300 yards from the town centre at
Porto Colom and one mile from the 18-hole D'Or golf course.
On the north-eastern coast of the island, Taylor Woodrow has started
work on the brand new Residencial Font de Sa Cala.
The 29 two and three-bedroom duplex apartments are laid out on two
floors, the lower given over to a living and dining area leading out
onto a balcony and/or garden, plus kitchen, utility room and cloakroom.
Upstairs, there is a large main bedroom with en-suite bathroom and
balcony, and buyers can choose from either one or two bedrooms plus a
shower room. All the bedrooms have built in pine wardrobes.
The apartments face south-east to catch the sun and all have sea
views. As with all Taylor Woodrow's developments in Spain, owners have
access to a large, private swimming pool.
The apartments have central heating, double glazing and private
parking, a communal satellite and FM aerial, and landscaped gardens.
Prices range from #76,250 to #97,500 and completion of the first phase
is scheduled for August.
Font de Sa Cala is located on the north-east coast of Majorca, a
five-minute drive from two of the most attractive 18-hole golf courses
on the island and only an hour's drive from Palma and the airport.

YET another honour for David Hope. A knighthood bestowed by the Queen
in a private audience. No it's not Wee Rettie, our own former Dean of
Faculty and current Lord President, elevated to the Upper House as a
baron in his own right in the New Year Honours list. It's that other
David Hope chappie, the new Archbishop of York, for his work as Dean of
the Chapels Royal and as Bishop of London. All of which must be a bit
confusing for the House of Lords flunkeys, spotting the difference
between two deanly Davids, both likely to spout an ex-cathedra quip.
Here's a tip for them: the boy with the mitre is unlikely to be seen
with the works of Middleton Rettie KC under his arm.
At prayer
THERE is another example closer to home of mixing matters legal and
spiritual. Dr Raj Jandoo, the first non-white lawyer to be admitted to
the Scottish Bar has been appointed principal of the new
inter-denominational Edinburgh Bible College. He's delivering a series
of lectures including the curiously titled ''The God on high made
cannabis'' and ''What the actress said to the bishop.''
Equal underwear
DESPITE the Parliament House merry-go-round last week, all of
Scotland's top law officers and permanent judges still have one small
thing in common. They are all men. For all the increasing female numbers
in the Faculty, the only distaff presence in the highest legal offices
are the old favourites Laura Norder and Avis Andum. A pity, but maybe
next time if that's all right with the chaps who sport the best briefs:
Y-fronts, that is, rather than Janet Reger. There again, most of them
have taken silk; can we ever be really sure what's worn in the
downstairs department?
Fiscal females
ON the same theme, last week's upbeat annual report on the Crown
Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (new motto: Fast Forward with
Falkirk) showed a 28% increase among women legal staff over the past
five years. They now number 104 compared with 148 men. But look further
and we see 260 people working as typists. All women, same as they were
in 1991. See equality in the workplace, see male typpingg?
Malone Rangers
FURTHER success on the sporting front. Faculty Phantoms, boasting the
cream of Scottish advocacy's soccer and socialising talents, went over
to Dublin and defeated their Irish Bar counterparts 5-1. Goals from Drew
McKenzie (2), Ian Duguid, Simon Gilbride, Tom Rice (og) were countered
by one from Micheal O'Higgins for the Four Courts men.
Axing the Acts
THE bill killers were out with a vengeance last week, condemning 220
acts and 300 statutory provisions to oblivion. The Statute Law (Repeals)
Act also swept away the 15 Glasgow Police Acts (1866-1904). These went
well beyond the question of what neds the polis could clobber, and
proved a model for civic administration, making Glasgow Governed just as
much a byword as Clyde Built around the world. The only solace for the
orginal draughtsmen is that most of their hard work is now incorporated
into national legislation.
Song date
HE liked a good tune, did our Walter, or as he more prosaically put
it: ''Few things delight or affect more than a simple tune sung with
feeling.'' Which is why the Signet Library is hosting a varied musical
evening on December 1 to raise money for scholarly research into the
collection at Sir Walter Scott's library at Abbotsford. Details and
tickets from faculty librarian Catherine Smith at Parliament House.

Mike Dailly assesses a new scheme for compensating victims of crime.
MICHAEL Howard's first attempt at introducing a tariff scheme for
victims of crimes of violence received short shrift in the House of
Lords earlier this year when it was deemed unlawful. But how will his
new tariff scheme work in practice?
Last week, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995 (CIC Act)
received royal assent, enabling a revised tariff based compensation
scheme to come into force on April 1, 1996.
The existence of this short piece of legislation -- a mere 12 sections
-- owes much to a remarkable legal challenge made by a consortium of
trade unions. Remarkable, as it resulted in the Government's
cost-cutting scheme being struck down as an abuse of prerogative power
by the Lords.
The current common law damages scheme was first introduced in 1964 and
had never been placed on a statutory footing until Parliament enacted
the Criminal Justice Act in 1988. Discretion to bring the 1988
provisions into force was left with the Home Secretary, who took it upon
himself to introduce a radically different scheme last April.
If left unchecked the Government's tariff scheme would have resulted
in untold hardship, as it made no provision for loss of earnings or
long-term nursing-care costs. It also took a broadsword to the potential
number of claimants by reducing the three-year time limit in which to
lodge claims to one year.
What then of the new tariff scheme? The new draft scheme contains a
major concession that will satisfy many earlier critics. Loss of
earnings or earning capacity for more than 28 weeks will be compensated,
as will special expenses, which includes reasonable nursing-care costs.
However, the scheme will be subject to a maximum overall claim of
#500,000.
While this sum seems more than generous it should be remembered that
the largest UK personal injuries pay-out stands at #3.4m. Half-a-million
pounds can be quickly eaten up where a victim of violence suffers from
severe brain damage and quadriplegia. If the victim is young,
compensation will have to provide for intensive nursing care and special
equipment costs for years to come.
The Government does not dispute that the number of claims likely to
exceed #500,000 is minuscule. Why then impose a financial limit to the
detriment of a handful of people most in need? Subject to limited
Parliamentary approval, the CIC Act will give the Home Secretary full
discretion to formulate tariff scheme rules -- that discretion should be
exercised to remove or at the very least increase the scheme's financial
cap.
Critics of the rule by which claims had to be lodged within one year
of injury have been met half-way: a two-year period is proposed under
the new scheme. In general, Scots law provides for a three-year
triennium period in which personal injury claims must be raised. The
abolition of this rule in CIC cases can have no other purpose than to
reduce the overall number of applicants.
But restricting the total number of claims is not the Government's
only concern. As a spokesperson for the Law Society of England and Wales
explains: ''The idea behind the tariff scheme is to control the cost of
the scheme and the cost of administration. By simplifying the scheme to,
for example, a broken leg equals #3000, the scheme can be administered
by unqualified civil servants rather than by advocates and barristers.
''The vast majority of cases are straightforward and can be dealt with
under a tariff. But complex cases with complex prognoses cannot be dealt
with under the tariff or by civil servants.''
Simplification translates into the identification of some 309 separate
types of injury -- more than 100 more than under the old tariff scheme.
Each injury carries a payment on one of the 25 tariffs; the lowest
tariff being #1000 and the highest #250,000.
Unfortunately there is no indication that the tariff scheme will be
index-linked and unless the Home Secretary agrees to do so, tariff
payments will soon be eroded by inflation.
Organisations such as Victim Support see two important advantages to
the new scheme: speed and certainty. Victims under the tariff scheme
will now know what level of compensation to expect and should have their
claim dealt with more speedily, given the simplification of the scheme.
So what are the disadvantages? Any simplified scheme will inevitably
operate on some arbitrary basis -- but does the tariff scheme go too
far? For example, sexual abuse of a child involving intercourse over a
period up to three years carries a tariff of #10,000. A day over three
years and the tariff becomes #17,500.
Many tariff injuries are distinguished as minor, moderate or severe:
will the Government issue objective guidance here or will decisions be
entirely subjective?
Just how these dividing lines will operate in practice is anyone's
guess. It may well be that arbitrary rulings by the new Criminal
Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) will be the price to pay for a
stream-lined system. But is that a price society can afford?
The Government's view is that the tariff scheme will remain the most
generous compensation scheme in the world. Total UK expenditure for the
scheme in 1993/94 was #165m -- a staggering double the cost six years
earlier.
Resources are finite and while the current scheme could cope with 554
applications in 1964/65, it certainly cannot deal with 73,000
applications in 1993/94. A backlog of more than 100,000 unresolved cases
is testimony to that.
The good news is that aggrieved applicants will still be able to
request a review of their cases. The new tariff scheme makes provision
for a review to a senior claims officer within 90 days, with a further
right of access to the CICA Appeals Panel. Notification of an appeal
must be made within 30 days of the review decision.
Of course, any legal right is only as effective as the applicant's
access to good advice and representation. Many people currently treat
the process of claiming criminal injuries compensation as a simple
form-filling exercise. This is wrong and likewise the new tariff scheme
should not be underestimated. Those who do may settle for inappropriate
awards or, worse still, obtain no award at all.
For example, in most cases it may be necessary to instruct specialist
reports to have any prospect of success. Serious indecent assault
carries a tariff of #3000, but the applicant may have suffered from
shock, post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental disorders. A
psychiatric diagnosis would be essential here, and the applicant could
claim under this tariff, and also be entitled to 10% of the indecent
assault tariff.
With a view to providing accessible guidance, the Legal Services
Agency, with support from BBC Children in Need, will publish Action
Guide to Claiming Criminal Injuries Compensation, later this month. This
is the only up-to-date legal text on the subject and anyone advising
victims of crimes of violence would do well to obtain it, together with
the forthcoming supplement on the tariff scheme.
The new tariff scheme is a remarkable legal victory. Many victims of
violence and surviving family members will be indebted to the trade
union movement for years to come.

<TEXT>
GORDON Strachan will not be moving to Wolves as successor to Graham
Taylor, who resigned as manager of the Molineux club on Monday.
The former Scotland, Aberdeen, Manchester United and Leeds United
player insisted yesterday that he will remain with Coventry City, where
he is player-coach under Ron Atkinson.
The bookmakers had made Strachan favourite to succeed Taylor, and they
also rated Atkinson among the fancied candidates.
But yesterday both Strachan and Atkinson asked Coventry to issue a
statement on their behalf, pledging their future to the Highfield Road
club.
Now Wolves' attention may switch to Jimmy Nicholl, the man who last
season led the then first division Raith Rovers to a Coca-Cola Cup
triumph and took them into Europe this season, and a joust with Bayern
Munich.
It is the second time in five months Nicholl, the former Manchester
United, Rangers and Northern Ireland defender, has been linked with a
move south.
He was interviewed for the vacant Norwich manager's post in the
summer, but, after believing he had landed the job, lost out to Martin
O'Neill, of Wycombe.
Nicholl declined to comment on the Molineux situation, but Raith
supporters' chief, Fraser Hamilton, urged the Kirkcaldy club to hang on
to their manager.
''Every time a big job comes up, it seems Jimmy's name is mentioned,''
said Hamilton, secretary of the Raith Supporters Club. ''Raith fans know
Jimmy Nicholl will, in all probability, leave eventually but we'd love
to postpone that moment for as long as possible.''
Former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough also threw his hat into
the ring yesterday after the roads towards Strachan and Atkinson were
blocked.
Coventry chairman Bryan Richardson said: ''We have not invested
heavily in them to have them pinched. I would refuse any approach to
speak to them.
''Mr Atkinson and Mr Strachan have asked me to put out a statement
pledging their future to Coventry City Football Club to avoid any
further speculation regarding the manager's job at Wolverhampton
Wanderers.''
Meantime, 60-year-old Clough said -- maybe with tongue in cheek:
''They (the Football Association) would not give me the chance of
preceding or following Graham Taylor as manager of England, but I would
not mind succeeding him at Wolves.''

SCOTLAND team manager Craig Brown was making confident noises at Troon
yesterday as he savoured the idea of taking on the Continent's finest in
the European Championship finals in England next summer.
It has to be stressed that Brown was not taking the Ally MacLeod route
and promising that the team would return with, at least, a medal to show
for their efforts.
But he did promise that the squad who have battled their way to these
finals when so many predicted failure would make an impact on the
matches which will be played next June.
As he finalised the preparations for tonight's meaningless clash with
San Marino at Hampden, Brown said: ''We have to prove to the fans who
are going to be at Hampden for this game that we can go to England and
make an impact on the tournament
''We do have to show them that we are not going to go across the
Border in the summer simply to make up the numbers. That will not be the
case. I believe, and so do the players, that we can make a major impact.
''As Gary McAllister was saying yesterday, we do want to get to the
second stage of the competition, and that is not beyond us. So far we
have proved that we are a difficult team to beat -- now we have to prove
that we can also entertain and score goals.
''There have been suggestions that we have qualified from a soft
group, but I do not accept that. Russia are one of the strongest
countries in Europe and if you look at the Champions' League, you'll see
that their top team, Spartak Moscow, who are good enough to win the
European Cup, and the Greek champions Panathanaikos, are both heading
their groups.
''Yet here we are sitting second in a section which involves these two
nations. There cannot be too much wrong with that.''
The problem Brown and his players have tonight, of course, is that no
one can take any result against San Marino seriously and yet, the game
has to be played and the result racked up in the record books and the
players will have to produce goals to please the 30,000 fans who are
expected to be at Hampden.
Brown wants to entertain the fans who have begun to appear in numbers
once more as the lure of the finals has focussed interest on the
national side.
He repeated yesterday: ''We will be very aggressive in this game. We
must have players going forward at all times and there is no use playing
too many men at the back when we know they will have just one man up.
''They will defend all through the game and they are becoming better
at doing that, but we want to break them down and, hopefully, at the end
of the night, we will get the result we want here, get the results we
want from elsewhere in Europe, and can concentrate fully on the finals.
''Maybe we will have an idea of the striking partnership we would like
to use in the finals.''
Brown gave few hints about his team for tonight, though it is certain
that Jim Leighton will be in goal, looking for his sixth successive
shutout, and the central defence will be composed of Colin Hendry, Colin
Calderwood, and Alan McLaren with the Ibrox men sitting in front of the
other two.
Gary McAllister, John Collins and Scot Gemmill will be in midfield,
while Stuart McCall was sent back to Ibrox for treatment as expected.

'It might be significant that the majority of the
people who will be pressing for a change in SFA
policy are relatively new to the game.'
WHILE the SFA continue to resist moves to have television evidence
used to punish violent conduct on the field of play, the controversial
issue is to be raised by two premier-division chairmen at tomorrow's
meeting of the Scottish Football League's management committee.
And it could mark the beginning of a campaign to bring Scottish
football into line with other countries, including England, where video
tape is used to determine players' guilt, or otherwise.
A growing number of influential voices are coming round to the idea
the sport cannot continue to deny the sophisticated and unambiguous
evidence of television when it highlights incidents which compel the
police to launch investigations.
The Herald attempted to contact all 10 premier-division chairmen, and
of the eight who responded, only one, Falkirk's George Fulston, said he
was against the use of TV film. Fulston, who as vice-president of the
SFL, will be at tomorrow's management committee meeting, believes
''football should be left to deal with its own problems in its own
way.''
However, it is clear the game is unable to police itself properly, and
the fact the SFA, who are responsible for disciplinary matters and
punishment, remain switched off to television does nothing to discourage
the Crown from intervening.
In these columns only yesterday the association's chief executive Jim
Farry said there had been a discussion on this issue six weeks ago when
it was ''overwhelmingly rejected,'' but after tomorrow, there might have
to be another more serious discussion.
Rangers' chairman David Murray was unwilling to comment on the matter,
which was perhaps understandable given that one or more of his club's
players might be the subject of investigation by the police, but it is
unlikely Campbell Ogilvie, who will represent Rangers tomorrow, will
argue against the call for discussion on the use of video tapes.
Also, Fergus McCann, Celtic's managing director, made it clear he
feels the time has come for the people's game to use technology instead
of hiding from it.
Both Kilmarnock's Bob Fleeting and Jim Oliver, of Partick Thistle, in
the course of independent discussions with The Herald, said yesteray
they would raise the question at the management committee meeting since
they are among the five premier-division representatives. The other
chairmen on the same wavelength are Hibernian's Douglas Cromb, also a
management committee member, Hearts' Chris Robinson, and John Chapman,
of Motherwell.
Raith Rovers' Alex Penman was involved in business meetings throughout
yesterday, and Ian Donald, chairman of Aberdeen, could not be contacted,
but he may have taken the same stance as Murray since the Dons also were
involved in last Saturday's Ibrox match.
Nevertheless, there is within the top division of the SFL a desire to
use television in matters of discipline, and it might be significant
that the majority of the people who will be pressing for a change in SFA
policy are relatively new to the game.
Apart from the moral issue, chairmen believe football would be better
able to keep the police out if they can prove they are using all
available methods to punish violent play which goes unnoticed by
referees. There is a general belief that the procurator-fiscal would not
have instructed the police to investigate the match between Rangers and
Aberdeen had referee John Rowbotham taken action against obvious
transgressors.
Even though from the sanctuary of England's training camp Paul
Gascoigne -- he will play against Switzerland at Wembley tonight -- is
attempting to make it clear he was a victim, his behaviour last weekend
was unacceptable and although the SFA won't receive their supervisor's
report until today, it is almost certain the midfield player will be
called to account. If so, many will regard subsequent SFA punishment as
another example of TV evidence being used when it suits the
establishment.
''My club, Hearts, do not have a policy view but I believe that what
TV shows it shows. It is there for everyone to see, so how can we in
football ignore that?'' asks Robinson.
The chairmen stress television proof should be used only to deal with
matters of discipline, and they point out the whole ball game would
become ridiculous if the BBC, Scottish Television, or BSkyB pictures
were able to have the results of matches reversed.
''On that basis, I would be very much in favour of television evidence
being used,'' said McCann. ''I don't see what is wrong with these
supervisors who are supposed to be at every match having access to TV
film.''
His view was echoed by Cromb at Easter Road. ''Yes, let us use this
form of evidence. When it is before our eyes it is difficult to deny,''
he said.
Motherwell's John Chapman was perhaps a surprise supporter because his
fellow Fir Park director, Bill Dickie, is president of the SFA and could
be regarded as a pillar of the establishment. ''We disagree on many
matters,'' Chapman said, ''and it happens to be my own opinion that
anyone who breaks the law should be punished.
''It could be people involved in the trouble which flared at a recent
boxing evening when one of the fighters died will be punished because of
video evidence so how can football resist?''
Pledging to raisethe subject tomorrow, Fleeting said: ''In specific
and the worst cases we should use everything at our disposal and if that
means television evidence then so be it. It is vital we send out the
correct signals to everyone.''
Oliver said he advocated the use of such evidence when he was on the
referee and disciplinary committee and he pointed out: ''Our best chance
is to raise the matter at the management committee and then proceed as
one from there. Surely there is an obligation on all of us to use the
best possible evidence which can work both ways in that it can acquit or
convict.''
If the SFL agree to push the case, they would have to go to the SFA,
but it is suspected that many of the committees follow a party, or
establishment line. Representatives from smaller clubs, who would not be
affected by television evidence, could outvote the premier-division
clubs and we may see the main players frustrated again.
''Look, football seems to have managed without television evidence and
we should continue to sort out our own problems,'' said Fulston. ''It
wouldn't be fair that only some clubs and players would be subjected to
this form of justice and I would rather hear directors and managers
telling their players not to play in a violent manner.''
However, Jock Brown, a lawyer and football commentator, dismantles the
argument that all games would have to be captured on film if proper
justice was to be served. ''One of the reasons the procurator-fiscal is
becoming involved is because he doesn't believe football can keep its
own house in order,'' he says.

SNOOKER
PAUL McPhillips tried to find a silver lining to last night's 9-3
defeat by Matthew Stevens in the Benson &amp; Hedges championship final.
After seven previous victories at Edinburgh's JP Leisure Centre, he
finally ran out of steam against his 18-year-old rival.
''I can be very optimistic from what I've achieved this week,'' said
the world No.64 from Thornliebank. ''I have beaten some very good
players and gained a lot of confidence. I am still left in five
tournaments and hopefully I can begin to improve my ranking.''
Stevens finished #13,000 richer, including the #8000 he is guaranteed
for reaching the B&amp;H Masters at Wembley next February.
The boy from Camarthen who compiled his first century break at the
tender age of 11 said: ''I always knew I had the ability to win
tournaments but it's just a question of getting consistency into my
game.''
Stevens faces countryman Terry Griffiths at Wembley Conference Centre.
''We practise together at Terry's club in Llanelli,'' explained Stevens,
now world-ranked No.57 from his season's starting position of No.236.
The teenager won the first frame on the black with a break of 51. He
added runs of 62, 81, 54, and 71 before the Scot stopped the rot at 1-6.
Last night Stevens added runs of 55, 38, and 43 before finishing in
style with a 122 clearance.
* AYRSHIRE'S Alan Burnett and England's David Gray clash today in
their qualifying section of the Embassy IBSF World Amateur Championships
in Bristol.
Gray, at 16, the youngest winner of the English Amateur title earlier
this year, crushed American Tang Hoa 4-0 with breaks of 74, 56, 65, and
115. World junior champion Burnett hit runs of 72 and 76 in beating
Malta's Kevin D'Agostino 4-2.

IT WOULD be surprising if Scotland chief Craig Brown did not use the
Aberdeen pairing of Scott Booth and Eoin Jess against the men from San
Marino tonight.
Both the Dons are ready to resume the international careers which were
so rudely interrupted by injuries and loss of form last season.
Jess, who played in the opening qualifying game of this current Euro
campaign up in Helsinki, wants to play in the closing match of the
series.
He maintained yesterday: ''I don't want another year-and-a-half
between my Scotland appearances. I want to take this chance and let
Craig see that I will be able to do a job for him in England.
''Maybe the timing is right for me as regards the finals. I am coming
back into the side at the right time -- providing I am able to maintain
my present form.
''It won't matter to me whether I play up front or in midfield. I
enjoy both roles but I still feel that I am learning about the new one,
especially abut defensive duties. But it's all so much better than last
season, when I was being played wide on the right, wide on the left, up
front, midfield -- I think the only position I wasn't used in was
'sweeper'.
''I didn't help myself, either. I allowed my head to go down. Now when
things are not going my way, I try to work harder to get back to form.''
While Jess cannot pick between the two roles he has found success
filling -- as striker and in midfield -- his partner Scott Booth
believes that the new club position has made Jess an even better player.
''He has come back to prove himself a fantastic player,'' Booth
enthused yesterday. ''Because he spent so long as a striker himself, he
knows exactly the kind of ball that we are looking for in the penalty
box. Eoin has marvellous vision and he is a tremendously creative
player. The deeper role suits him perfectly.''
Tonight we shall see which one he is asked to fill. Brown has
suggested that the striker's job is the one he would prefer for Jess,
but yesterday he also hinted that a midfield role may still be a
possibility.
Tonight, as the country's fate is being decided in faraway places with
strange-sounding names, we will find out just where Jess will play and
whether Brown has been able to discover a front-line partnership which
can make the European impact he wants.
* KEEPER Michael Watt will come back tonight to stake his claim for a
place in Aberdeen's Coca-Cola Cup final plans.
The Pittodrie keeper dropped out with a serious knee injury, sustained
against Celtic at Parkhead last month, but he has made a rapid recovery
and will face Rangers in a reserve match tonight to take the first step
towards Hampden and a possible place against Dundee.
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said yesterday: ''Watt has worked hard on
his fitness since the injury. I will be looking closely at him and Brian
Irvine with a view to the final.''
Meantime, Aberdeen have freed reserve defender Derek Reeley, whose
progress has been hampered by injuries.
* COUNCILLORS last night deferred a decision on whether to award
Caledonian Thistle FC a #900,000 local authority grant towards their new
#5.4m stadium.
Caley have threatened to quit the Scottish League if the cash is not
awarded.
A date for the meeting will not be set until further talks between the
club and council are complete.

San Marino Under-21s 0
SEVEN in a row took on entirely new connotations last night at Firhill
as the current Under-21 team collected another victory in the European
Championships, giving them a record seventh successive triumph.
They took a while to get their engine warmed up at Firhill, but once
they got into top gear, they were never likely to fail in their mission
to become a unique Scottish side at this age group.
Now they will wait with enthusiasm to hear who their opponents will be
in the last eight of the championships when the draw is made tomorrow in
Geneva.
On their track record, they have no reason to fear anyone, it is not
too often we are able to say that about any Scotland side.
For all of the first half the young Scots found it difficult to get
past a well-marshalled and disciplined defence but they found the way
through soon after the interval, by which time Brian McLaughlin had
injected a fresh impetus to the attack.
Andy Liddell, of Barnsley, was the man who made the breakthrough,
although it might need a photo-finish picture to decide if the ball was
over the line for an own goal before he reached it. But that settled any
anxiety, and the opposition defence had to hang on to try to keep the
score at that respectable level.
The only depressing moment for manager Tommy Craig was the sending-off
of Scott McNiven, who had come on in the second half and lasted only 34
minutes of his first cap appearance before collecting two yellow cards
and having to leave the field. It was youthful exasperation rather than
anything malicious that earned him his dismissal, as he was booked a
second time for dissent.
The news before the kick-off that Russia had beaten Finland 3-0 meant
that these young Scots were home and dry in the quarter-finals without
needing as much as a cheer at Firhill.
Craig was delighted for the seventh time since he took over the
running of the Under-21s, saying: ''To win seven out of eight in our
group is the way to qualify. It was a little bit frustrating against a
team that set their stall out as they did but it was so important to get
that goal.
''It was a new experience for most of these lads playing against a
system like that. But overall this group of players have played some
good stuff and contributed greatly to the section.
''I was disappointed that Scott McNiven was sent off but he did look
good for the time he was on. I've reassured him and told him he will be
back okay.
''Our overall record will mean that anyone that meets us now is
entitled to give us respect.''
However, the men from the tiny republic put up a staunch show of
defiance for a long time last night. Scotland did not create much until
a McNamara cross was knocked down by Hamilton, and Liddell turned and
shot in the one movement. Unfortunately, he was slightly off target.
The best chance came in 27 minutes when Dailly's cross from the left
was nodded on by Liddell, and Hamilton met it at knee height only to
lift it just over the bar. Hamilton again was unlucky when he turned and
shot from close range only to see Valentini clear off the line.
For the second half, Scotland replaced McNamara with McNiven, and
McCann with McLaughlin, who at once went off on a run and was severely
upended by Ugolini, who was booked for his recklessness.
There was more purpose about the Scots now and they got the goal in 52
minutes. Hamilton had hit a hard shot into the goal, where San Marino
defender Valentini diverted it towards his own goal and Liddell helped
it on its way over the line.
McNiven had his name taken after a foul on Zonzini before Donnelly hit
the underside of the bar after Liddell had laid on the pass. The Oldham
player then foolishly kicked the ball over the bar after a foul had been
given against Freedman, thus earning a second yellow card and the
compulsory red. It means the young Anglo misses the quarter-final.
In the closing seconds Donnelly was booked for taking a free kick too
quickly.
SCOTLAND -- Stillie (Aberdeen), McNamara (Celtic), Sheerin
(Southampton), Murray (Rangers), Pressley (Dundee United), Handyside
(Grimsby Town), Donnelly (Celtic), Hamilton (Dundee), Liddell
(Barnsley), Dailly (Dundee United), McCann (Dundee). Substitutes:
Gardiner (Hibs), Freedman (Crystal Palace), McLaughlin (Celtic), McNiven
(Oldham Athletic), Bollan (Rangers).
SAN MARINO -- Ceccoli, Giannini, Bacciocchi, Pelliccioni, Valentini, L
Gasperoni, B Gasperoni, Muccioli, Ugolini, Pancotti, Gatti. Substitutes:
Zanotti, Zucchi, Zonzini, D Gasperoni, Moretti.
Referee -- S Lazarevski (Macedonia).

FRIENDLY INTERNATIONAL
PAUL Gascoigne will take his place in a surprise England line-up
against Switzerland tonight. He hurt a knee in a collision with Dennis
Wise in training but is fit enough to start.
Alan Shearer, eight games without a goal, is retained in a new-look
attack, with Spurs striker Teddy Sheringham to support him in a
deep-lying role.
Steve McManaman and Newcastle midfielder Robert Lee unexpectedly are
retained. Gary Pallister again partners Tony Adams in defence, and
Stuart Pearce wins his sixty-first cap.
* DAVE Sexton indicated he is ready to step aside as coach after
England failed to qualify for the European Under-21 Championship finals
last night.
The youngsters failed -- despite goals from Liverpool's Robbie Fowler
and Neil Shipperley of Southampton in a 2-1 victory over Austria at
Middlesbrough -- because of Portugal's 3-1 defeat of the Republic of
Ireland.
Sexton, who has been in charge since 1977 apart from a spell between
1990-93, said later that he would be prepared to move aside -- with Ray
Wilkins earmarked to take over. The Queen's Park Rangers manager has
acted as Sexton's assistant in recent games.

CHAMPIONSHIP GROUP 6
THE Republic of Ireland's crucial European Championship qualifier in
Lisbon tonight is in danger of being called off after torrential rain.
Benfica's pitch was under water last night and the Republic, who need
to beat Portugal to be totally sure of second place, could not have
their final training session on the ground.
Sean Connolly, chief executive of the Football Association of Ireland,
said: ''More rain is forecast for tomorrow and if the pitch is in the
same condition as it is tonight, there's no chance of the game going
on.''
He has warned the Portuguese FA that the Republic will not contemplate
a switch to Sporting Lisbon's stadium a few miles away. An estimated
20,000 Irish fans have travelled to Portugal.
A postponement would have repercussions in Belfast, where Northern
Ireland are to play Austria, who are one point behind the Republic. UEFA
have insisted that both matches kick off at the same time so that no-one
has an advantage. Northern Ireland manager Bryan Hamilton has sent a
message of goodwill to counterpart Jack Charlton, and a home victory at
Windsor Park would let their neighbours in.

JUDY Bell, a former Curtis Cup player and team captain, will in
January be elected the first woman president of the United States Golf
Association at the organisation's annual meeting, to be held on this
occasion at Orlando, Florida. Bell, who in 1987 became the first woman
member of the USGA's executive committee, was subsequently treasurer,
secretary, and vice-president.
Bell, who has an interest in several retail businesses in her home
area of Colorado Springs, was a member of the USGA's women's committee
in 1968 and later its chairman. She will not, however, be the only woman
involved in directing American golf. Among those on the 16-member
executive committee is Carol Semple Thompson, who has been nominated for
a further term of office.
* A NET 70 was good enough for 10-handicapper Tom Bennett, of
Prestwick St Cuthbert, to win the Iain McLeod Cup at the Ayrshire Winter

In the pro section, Stuart Kerr and Haldane Lee both were joint top on
level-par 71.
Ian Mossman, a New York-based pro, tied for fourth on 73. Leading

SCOTTISH UNIVERSITIES
EDINBURGH and St Andrews meet today in the final of the Scottish
Universities championship at Stirling.
Both sides won all their pool matches, St Andrews achieving a
first-round 20-3 win over holders Dundee to set them on course and
Edinburgh beating Aberdeen 13-3 at Balgownie.
Not for the first time in their long history, Edinburgh field a side
with a strong Irish influence. Winger Peter Haslett and flanker David
Watt both represented Ulster at under-20 level and prop Willie Mulhall
played for Leinster Schools.
The side also have considerable experience in stand-off Piers
McWhannel, who played for London Scottish, and scrum half Hywel
Williams, a Cheshire under-21 player.
Moreover, they have Scottish Universities players in Scott Roberts at
hooker, Andy Lucking at lock, and Rob Henley at No.8.
St Andrews, with no current Scottish Universities players in their
side, have the confidence of success in Division 6 of the Tennents
national league. They are unbeaten at home and currently are lying joint
second.
St Andrews -- C Kerin; C Wakefield, P Ainsworth, J Acton, M von
Hapsburg; A Armstrong, M Rennie; D Primrose, N McLaren (captain), A
Ravenscroft, N Christie, P Anderson, M Pickles, P Sanderson, B Crosse.
Edinburgh -- R Bailes; K Brennan, M Mansour, J How (captain), P
Haslett; P McWhannel, H Williams; T Cohn, S Roberts, W Mulhall, J Harte,
A Lucking, S Cadzow, R Henley, D Watt.

North and Midlands 43,
Western Samoa 9
NORTH and Midlands ripped the heart out of Western Samoa at McDiarmid
Park in Perth last night with a five-try display of aggressive,
controlled rugby which sets the stage perfectly for the Murrayfield Test
on Saturday.
Old soldiers like Stewart Hamilton and Danny Herrington set a fine
example for the North and Midlands side captained by Dave McIvor who
drove like a demon at the demoralised Samoans. The backs, too, were
alert on the attack and presented a stone-wall defence on the few
occasions that the Samoans ran at them.
Mark McKenzie had a fine game, the least of which was his 18 points
from the boot, and John Kerr was in startling form on the wing with a
hat trick of tries.
Perhaps this indicates that the Samoans are very much a one-team
touring party -- the Test side being streets ahead of the second-string.
Nothing, however, should diminish this North and Midlands' effort -- in
front of a crowd of 4519 -- which was magnificent.
A delighted McIvor said afterwards, with reference to Edinburgh
Academicals' controversial defeat by Melrose on Saturday: ''Three days
is certainly a long time in rugby. The boys were absolutely superb.
''We watched the Samoans play Edinburgh and Scotland A and reckoned
that they hadn't taken the game to them. We weren't going to make the
same mistake and the plan was to take it to them at every opportunity.''
Western Samoa coach Bryan Williams said his side had not
underestimated North and Midlands: ''No, we knew it was going to be
tough but not that tough,'' he said. ''Some of our younger boys learned
what rugby at that level is all about tonight. If they have learned
something from the experience then it hasn't all been bad news.''
North and Midlands were by no means overawed by the South Sea
islanders and took the game to them with vim and vigour. Early on, they
showed that they had learned the lessons from the Scotland A game at
Mansfield Park by employing some profitable lineout variations.
The home side went into the lead after nine minutes when Flockhart
took the ball on at pace, slipped the ball to McKenzie, and the Samoans
were penalised at the ensuing maul. Mark McKenzie steered home the
30-metre effort.
A minute later, the Samoans equalised with a penalty goal, the referee
dealing sternly with North and Midlands back-chat.
McKenzie had struck the upright with a 30-metre drop-goal effort by
the time that a fired-up North and Midlands side stormed back on to the
offensive and, after good close-quarter running, Paul Rouse steamed over
at the corner flag for a try to make it 8-3. McKenzie failed with the
conversion attempt.
After some superb driving by the North and Midlands side, McKenzie
sent a second drop goal attempt wide of the posts, but it mattered not.
The Samoans had been caught off-side in front of their posts and
McKenzie stroked over the simplest of penalty goals.
With two Samoans down hurt -- a testament to the North and Midland
determination to fight fire with fire -- the tourists were penalised yet
again and McKenzie put over his third penalty goal.
Two minutes before the interval, and after a superb run by Renton with
Flockhart at his shoulder, North and Midlands were halted a yard short
of the Samoan line. However, the Samoans were caught offside once again
and McKenzie slotted home his fourth penalty goal.
In first-half injury time McIvor, Waite, Kerr, and Burns swept upfield
and, from the ruck, Harper fed John Kerr for a try at the corner flag.
With McKenzie's conversion North and Midlands enjoyed a 24-3 half-time
lead.
Campbell Burnes, the Samoan fly half had the opportunity to kick-start
a comeback early in the second half with a penalty effort from 30 metres
out but, like so much else on the Samoan agenda, the kick went awry.
McKenzie's third attempt to drop a goal went wide of the posts before
the Samoans began to put together something resembling a game-plan and
made a rare appearance in the North and Midlands' half.
With just over an hour played Burnes had another attempt at goal --
North and Midlands penalised for off-side -- and this time the ball flew
true to make it 24-6.
North and Midlands hammered home their superiority a few moments later
when Dave McIvor trapped and turned Samoan full back Autagavaia, the
ball popped out, and McKenzie struck a gem of a chip to the corner flag
where John Kerr pounced for his second try. McKenzie failed with the
conversion.
Nine minutes from the end John Kerr got his hat trick and what a
priceless piece of rugby it was. Harper, McKenzie and Carruthers
combined for a dazzling passage of handling in front of the Samoan posts
before Kerr latched on to a superb ball and grounded under the crossbar.
McKenzie converted.
Cameron Burnes put over his third penalty goal in another rare Samoan
sally just as a bank of fog descended.
The finale to a superb North and Midlands performance came in the
third minute of injury time when Waite picked up from the base of a
scrummage. Neill Renton scampered over in the corner and McKenzie
converted.
North and Midlands -- S Burns (Edinburgh Academicals); N Renton
(Kirkcaldy), P Rouse (Dundee HS FP), A Carruthers (Kirkcaldy), J Kerr
(Watsonians); M McKenzie, K Harper (both Stirling County); D Herrington
(Kirkcaldy), R Cairney (Stirling County), W Anderson (Kirkcaldy), S
Grimes (Watsonians), S Hamilton (Stirling County), D McIvor, M Waite
(both Edinburgh Academicals), G Flockhart (Stirling County).
Replacement -- B Easson (Boroughmuir) for Rouse (67).
Western Samoa -- A Autagavaia; T Faaiuso, K Tuigamala, S Leaega, F
Fereti; C Burnes, M Vaea; B Reidy, T Leota, G Latu, M Birtwhistle, S
Lemamea, L Taala, S Smith, M Iupeli.
Replacement -- T Leiasamaivo for Leota (51).
Referee -- A Lewis (Ireland).
SCORERS: North and Midlands: Kerr 3t; Rouse 1t; Renton 1t; McKenzie
4pg, 3c. Western Samoa: Burnes 3pg.

BOWLS:
HOPES of a Scottish victory in the European indoor team championship
were fast receding last night. They were 14 points behind leaders Wales
at the end of the third day of the seven-day event.
Wales, with 16 wins from their 18 matches to date, are on 32 points,
nine clear of England on 23 with the Scots five further adrift.
Yesterday the Scots won all three of their pairs matches and lost
their three triples matches -- an exact reversal of Monday's fate.
In the pairs, David Gourlay and Hugh Duff coasted to a 29-11 victory
over Jersey's John Lowery and David Le Marquand and then beat England's
Gary Smith and Andy Thomson 26-24.
The England pair reversed their playing order with world champion
Thomson going to lead and Smith taking over the skip's role. With eight
ends played the Scots led 15-1 then dropped successive doubles and a 6.
They countered with a 6 on the twelfth end but dropped a maximum 8 on
the next to be only two in front, an advantage they maintained.
Scotland's other success came in women's pairs where Sarah Gourlay,
mother of David, and Jan Woodley edged out Jersey's Susan Noel and Val
Stead 18-17.
In the triples, Angus Blair's side lost 24-9 to Tony Allcock's England
team and 21-8 to Jason Greenslade's Welsh side while Joyce Lindores lost
her first match 15-19 to Edna Bessell's England team. Results:
Men's pairs -- Wales 23, Guernsey 9; Scotland 29, Jersey 11; Ireland
26, England 17; Jersey 35, Guernsey 10; Wales 20, Ireland 10; Scotland
26, England 24.
Men's triples -- Wales 16, Ireland 15; England 24, Scotland 9;
Guernsey 19, Jersey 14; Jersey 14, England 14; Wales 21, Scotland 8;
Ireland 20, Guernsey 8.
Women's pairs -- England 18, Ireland 10; Wales 30, Guernsey 10:
Scotland 18, Jersey 17. Women's triples -- England 19, Scotland 15;
Guernsey 15, Jersey 13; Wales 14, Ireland 9.

GOLF
SANDY Lyle, who has spent most of his time in Europe since 1989, will
rejoin the US Tour next year.
Officials said that Lyle, who resigned his membership in 1990 to
concentrate on the European Tour, will return as an exempt member until
1998 on the basis of his 10-year exemption for winning the 1988 Masters.
Lyle, 37, has won 28 international events, including the 1985 Open and
has five career titles on the US Tour, including the Masters and the
1987 Players' Championship. He was No.31 on the European Tour this year
with #151,000 in 18 starts and made #15,272 in seven US Tour events.
* COLIN Montgomerie, the European No.1, flew home from the Far East
yesterday after withdrawing from the Dunlop Phoenix tournament which
begins tomorrow in Tokyo.
The Scot had been due to play in his second Japanese event following
last week's Taiheiyo Masters, where he aggravated his injured left wrist
during a final-round 71 which dropped him to fourth. He is to seek
specialist advice.

RUGBY ROUND-UP
CONNACHT made history in Galway yesterday with their first victory
against a national touring team. Star of the show was fly half Eric
Elwood -- relegated to Ireland's replacement bench for Saturday's Test
at Lansdowne Road. He landed three conversions and two penalties in
dreadful conditions for a 27-5 win to follow their victory over South
African touring team Griqualand West.
The home side went ahead in two minutes. Elwood's blind-side break
opened the Fiji defence for skipper Kevin Devlin to claim the first of
their three tries. Elwood converted, and added the extra points 10
minutes later after Rory Rogers dived over. Elwood also landed two
penalty goals.
Fiji's points came late in the first half when full back Rasolosolo
Bogisa went over for an unconverted try.
Michael Devine scored a late try. Elwood converted.
* TWO tries each by winger Jonah Lomu and full back Glen Osborne
helped New Zealand restore pride three days after losing the first Test
to France with a 55-17 demolition of a French Selection XV in Nancy.
* WINGER Jacques Olivier was was handed the perfect belated birthday
present when he was named in South Africa's team for the Twickenham Test
against England on Saturday. Olivier, who was 27 yesterday, is the only
change from the line-up which beat Italy on Sunday, although there will
be six new faces on view from the side that secured World Cup glory
against New Zealand in June. He wins his twelfth cap, replacing James
Small on the right wing.
* BRISTOL prop Alan Sharp, who last week announced his career as a
Scotland international was over, has escaped a ban after having been
cleared of foul play in the scrum during the clash with Leicester in
October. But Gloucestershire Rugby Football Union's disciplinary
committee upheld his earlier yellow card for stamping in the clash with
West Hartlepool the month before. A 15-day suspension was given to
Gloucester forward Chris Raymond, who has been yellow carded twice this
term.
* GRAEME Inglis, captain of Scotland's under-18 team last season,
steps up to Glasgow's under-19 squad for a practice match against an Ayr
XV at Millbrae today (7pm).
Yesterday's results
Tour matches -- North and Midlands 43, Western Samoa 9; Edinburgh
Academicals Under-21 7, New Zealand Under-20s Development XV 30;
Edinburgh Academy Development XV 0, New Zealand Under-23 36.
Other match -- Murrayfield 7, Penicuik 13.

RICHARD Dunwoody took the riding honours at rain-soaked Newton Abbot
yesterday with a 747-1 four-timer aboard Northern Saddler, Mouse Bird,
Nazzaro, and Granham Pride.
And trainer Ron Hodges is hoping Northern Saddler's victory under
top-weight in the HEAT Handicap Chase will prove a change in fortunes
for his Somerset stable.
Without a winner for 40 days, Hodges said: ''Our horses have been
running like hairy dogs and I didn't think this horse could win carrying
12st.
''I ran a horse called Commanchero at Plumpton yesterday who had been
working as well as this one and he stopped like he'd been shot, so what
can you do?
''I cannot find anything wrong with the horses and we've changed
everything at home in the hope it would change our luck, so let's hope
with this horse winning we've turned the corner,'' added Hodges.
Dunwoody sent Northern Saddler to the front at the eighth fence and
the eight-year-old saw off all challengers before scoring by 15 lengths
from Dear Do after closest pursuer Waterford Castle capsized at the
last.
The reigning champion jockey cannot have partnered many easier winners
that Mouse Bird, who coasted away with the South West Racing Club
Novices Hurdle after collaring long-time leader Caspian Beluga two out.
Dunwoody completed his treble as Nazzaro made virtually all the
running for the Claude Whitley Memorial Challenge Cup handicap Chase.
The quartet was completed when he brought Kim Bailey's newcomer
Granham Pride with a well-timed run to collar Scotby inside the final
furlong of the concluding bumper.

CRICKET
DEVON Malcolm, the destroyer of South African dreams just 15 months
ago, is hanging on to a Test place by his fingertips.
The Derbyshire fast bowler seems certain to be among a squad of 12 to
be named after today's final practice session at Centurion Park. But the
doubt will continue right up to 10am tomorrow.
John Crawley is probably in better form than any other batsman but is
likely to miss out. Likely 12: Atherton, Stewart, Ramprakash, Thorpe,
Hick, Smith, Russell, Cork, Gough, Illingworth, Fraser, Malcolm.
Meanwhile, leg-spinner Ian Salisbury helped England A maintain their
100% tour record in Pakistan yesterday -- and then fixed up a special
''clinic'' with Abdul Qadir. The Pakistani king of leg-spin tricks was
happy to accept Salisbury's invitation to join him in a net session in
Lahore in 10 days' time.
Qadir watched briefly as England A overwhelmed a Pakistan Cricket
Board XI by eight wickets. The 25-year-old Salisbury, whose senior
England career has never got going, has started this tour in style,
taking eight wickets in the opening first match in Karachi and three for
31 yesterday.
Richard Stemp's four for 46 meant England A required just 100 for
victory after dismissing the PCB XI for 153.
* WESTERN Union chiefs may have to settle for a second division of
just nine clubs.
The league have already recruited eight clubs from the Glasgow League,
and Border League minnows Dumfries to make up their lower division. They
want 1991 county champions Ayrshire to make up the numbers but the
Prestwick club have already agreed to join the new Scottish League,
formed last month by the merger of East League and county sides.
West officials will be forced to form their second division with just
nine clubs if they cannot find another club before their annual meeting
tomorrow.

Network Q RAC Rally will again decide the outcome of the world
championship for drivers and manufacturers.
The event organisers have made provision along every yard of the
1445-mile route to accommodate more than two million spectators, the
majority eager to witness the performance of a Scottish rally driver who
is poised to become the first Briton to win the world championship.
The day before, in Leeds, the Millers Oils RAC Historic Rally -- for
rally cars of yesteryear -- begins its two-day test of men and machines,
and here, too, a Scottish driver is tipped to shoulder the winner's
laurels.
The two drivers come from the same Lanark family, and in motorsport's
record books it is difficult to find an equal to the McRaes.
Father Jimmy, favourite to win the historic rally in a Porsche 911,
was first crowned British rally champion in 1982 driving an Opel Ascona.
He equalled Roger Clark's record of four championship titles in 1987
and, for good measure, added one more the following year.
After a gap of two years it was young Colin -- wisely contracted by
the Banbury-based Prodrive Subaru Team -- who was, at the age of 23, to
follow in his father's wheel tracks and add his name to the championship
trophy. The following year he successfully defended his title prior to
embarking on a limited world-championship programme which was intended
to groom him for things to come. Again two years elapsed before Alister
-- 25 next month -- became the third McRae to win the British title,
this time with a Nissan Sunny GTi.
Jimmy, now 52, is justly proud of his and his sons' achievements.
''Just recently a lot of people have been asking if there are any other
families with a track record similar to our in motorsport. I have to say
I can't think of any. The nearest we can come up with is the Andretti
family. As father and son, they have several race wins and titles to
their credit. So we are very proud of our eight British championship
titles in 14 years and, of course, Colin is poised to win the biggest
prize in rallying,'' said Jimmy.
Colin starts the RAC Rally, the eighth and final round of the world
championship equal on points with his Subaru Impreza 555 team-mate
Carlos Sainz. It is a straight fight between them for the title, which
Sainz has won twice before.
''To win the championship I must finish ahead of Carlos; if second,
third, or fourth place is good enough, then that's what I'll go for,''
said Colin.
Jimmy said: ''I think Colin has realised that you don't have to win
every stage and every rally to become a champion. The mark of a champion
is one who picks and chooses his time when to attack and when to avoid
risks.''
This year's RAC Rally could also be Alister's opportunity to prove his
worth to a world-championship team.
In an eleventh-hour deal he accepted an offer from Malcolm Wilson,
last year's British champion, to ''hire'' the Ford Escort Cosworth that
Ari Vatanen drove to victory on April's Pirelli International Rally,
round two of the British championship.
''Even though I won the British title with Nissan, there was no budget
for the RAC. The deal with Malcolm, assisted by Ford and my personal
sponsors Pirelli, was too good to turn down. For me it's a new team,
car, and co-driver. The only constant denominators are the tyres
underneath the wheel-arches,'' said Alister.
When posed the difficult question of which of his two rallying sons --
Stuart, the youngest, has no aspirations to become a driver, but will be
preparing Colin's meals on the RAC -- he regards as most like himself,
Jimmy is forthright in his response.
''Alister. He's maybe not as naturally talented as Colin, who can get
into anything on two or four wheels and drive it to its absolute limits
within a very short time. Alister is more a planner and thinker, but
equally determined. Whatever he sets out to do, he usually achieves,''
said Jimmy.
The brothers are currently on a slow-speed reconnaissance of all 28
timed special stages to be used on this year's event, a task that will
take six days and cover 2000 miles.
''This is the worst but an essential part of the rally. Driving at
30mph over the 350 miles of competitive sections, the majority on forest
tracks, is a bit of a drag, especially when we have to go over each
section twice,'' said Colin.
And what advice has Alister sought from Colin? ''He's my tyre
consultant. My dad will drive through each of the stages before Colin
tackles them so he knows just what the surfaces will be like.''
Colin adds: ''It's great to have Dad around. He does this advance
checking for me on most of the world-championship rallies, and I have
100% confidence in what he tells me.''

KEEPING our roads and motorways free from ice and snow is an
undertaking which is central to safe winter driving. And with the road
mix that is found in Strathclyde region it demands a team effort to keep
the roads safe and one which is entrusted to the region's Roads Direct
department.
A typical such operation is carried out at East Kilbride, a town with
a population of around 100,000 and a high level of car ownership. It
also has a weave of roads from motorway to rural that stretch a distance
of 300 miles and cover 18 routes. But more important, the town lies
between 400ft and 600ft above sea level and is susceptible to inclement
winter weather.
John O'Brien is superintendent at the region's Hawbank depot, and it
is up to him and his team of 40 personnel to ensure the roads in his
charge are kept free of snow and ice. It is no mean task, and one which
requires liaison between police, weather men and the roads department.
Roads Direct receives a constant flow of information from the weather
centre and other agencies which is matched against a feedback from road
sensors and other known information such as thermal mapping profiles.
As superintendent, John O'Brien has the responsibility to respond to
any change in weather condition or variation in local weather, including
complaints from the police.
If salting is required, gritting commences with the highest priority
route using six gritters in one phase. Footpaths to and from shopping
precincts and areas of high pedestrian traffic are gritted
simultaneously with carriageways.
At the moment John has stocks of 10,000 tonnes of rock salt, an amount
which is adequate for a normal winter. Let's hope that come spring, he
has made little impression on that stockpile.

Make sure your vehicle is in good condition -- mechanically and
electrically. A full service should do the trick.
Check the strength of the anti-freeze in your radiator. Your local
dealer will ensure that the correct additive is used.
Replace windscreen wiper blades if they have been in use for more than
one year.
Prepare for frost by having at hand a de-icer spray and plastic
scraper inside your car and at home. Park the vehicle in a garage or
closer to the side of the house to give it some protection.
Check the condition of the fan belt and replace it if in doubt.
Have the battery and starter motor checked.
Top-up the windscreen washer and add screen wash additive suitable for
winter conditions.
A wet-start spray is handy to have on a damp day when your car won't
start.
Useful additions to your car accessories include a set of jump leads,
tow rope and snow-beaters such as a small spade and a couple of old
sacks or matting in case your tyres need extra grip.
Stop the risk of corrosion in the floor of your vehicle by placing
rubber mats on the carpet to protect them. Condensation problems can be
tackled by keeping a dry cloth or chamois leather handy.
Always test your brakes after driving through flood water.

Citroen's different engines set it apart, says Ross Finlay
WHEN Citroen arranged what it promised would be ''an MPV launch with a
difference'', certain thoughts came to mind that it might involve
driving a clutch of fashion models from engagement to engagement, just
to show how the new Synergie copes with its full passenger capacity.
Citroen often goes off at a tangent from the usual way of doing
things, not always to divert attention from the fact that its vehicle
launches are usually based in Slough. In the past, it has discovered
sand and gravel surfaced public roads in Oxfordshire to show off the
ride qualities of the Xantia, and provided a car linked up to a caravan,
to demonstrate the benefits of self-levelling suspension.
At the Synergie launch, no fashion models, but it was different
nevertheless. We were loaded four or five into each vehicle so that we
tried all three rows of seats, and somebody from the Citroen press
office did the first short driving stint, before baling out and waving
us goodbye from the roadside in Windsor Great Park.
The problem with the MPV market is that so much of the apparent
variety in it depends on badge engineering. The Synergie is essentially
the same base vehicle as its Peugeot and Fiat rivals. But each company
can instal its own engines and settle on its own equipment levels, with
the result that these MPVs are by no means identical when you get them
out on the road.
Citroen manages to ring the changes in the Synergie by offering two
different engines, a 125bhp two-litre petrol job and a 92bhp 1.9-litre
turbo diesel, as well as five, six or seven-seater styles, and equipment
specifications at LX, SX and VSX levels.
There are nine models on the list, at prices from #16,200 to #18,755
for the petrol versions, and from #17,200 to #23,090 for the turbo
diesels. Unexpectedly, the top ranked VSX is diesel rather than petrol.
The petrol Synergie will reach 60mph in under 13 seconds, go on to a
test track maximum of 110mph, and offer a motorway fuel consumption
around 30mpg compared with something like 24mpg around town.
Naturally, the less powerful turbo diesel takes a couple of seconds
longer to reach 60mph with a light passenger load, and would not quite
reach a test-track ''ton''. But it has better fuel consumption of 35mpg
at 75mph, and 31mpg in city traffic.
Running four-up, it was noticeable that the turbo diesel pulled much
more strongly in the mid range. As usual, the petrol version had no real
answer to the turbo diesel's abundant torque.
Seating arrangements in MPVs are versatile, and the Synergie continues
that trend. You can turn round or remove different seats to provide
layouts like two pairs facing each other with a fold-down seat-back
table between them.
The MPV's obvious lack of luggage space, if there is no roof box, can
be compensated for by sacrificing one rearmost seat. And travelling
four-up, we found that it is quite a good idea to remove the middle-row
seats to allow people in the back extra stretching room.
The Synegie has sliding doors at each side to allow access to the
middle and rear rows of seats, with a neat arrangement to stop an open
fuel filler cap being demolished by a flung-back door.
Standard equipment or extra-cost options include twin sun roofs,
under-seat storage boxes, bottle holders and aircraft-type cup holders,
fold-down coathooks and even a roof-level container for sunglasses. The
VSX specification features alloy wheels, air conditioning and anti-lock
brakes.
Two items in the front cabin to keep the floor as uncluttered as
possible include a handrake to the driver's right, and a short,
fascia-mounted, cable-linked gear lever. While it is a sensible
space-saver, I wonder how long it might be before the dreaded
cable-stretch appears.

THE Government launches the second stage of its autumn political
''offensive'' on Labour in the Queen's Speech today. However, it is so
short of troops that a Reserve Forces Bill is needed to bolster the
regulars.
New laws to be introduced by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo will
make for speedier call-up in emergencies.
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames is calling for 350 volunteers
for the Nato peace implementation force for Bosnia.
Two new categories of reserve are to be created: a 5000-strong High
Readiness Reserve comprising special skilled personnel such as medics
and linguists, and a Sponsored Reserve for support tasks.
Their civilian jobs will be protected and their civilian pay will be
made up by Whitehall.
For the first time, reservists will be used in peacekeeping
operations, humanitarian aid and for natural disasters.
With the rundown of regular armed forces since the end of the Cold
War, Britain's resources have been stretched. The Gulf war found the
Government with insufficient powers to call up more than a few hundred
reservists.
The Reserve Forces Bill follows a four-month pilot scheme when a
220-strong Territorial Army force guarded the Falklands.
Volunteers, who will require permission from their employers, will
sign up for periods of 12 months on call.
Their employers will receive compensation for their absence and the
volunteers a special bounty.
The Queen's Speech -- containing 15 Bills, two more than last year's
-- marks the second phase, after the Tory Party conference last month,
in the Prime Minister's attempt to regain the political initiative from
Labour. The Tories are lagging Labour by up to an unprecedented 40
points in opinion polls.
Yesterday a new poll of business managers taken by the Institute of
Management indicates that Mr Blair's support has increased by 4% last
month and by 19% since the 1992 General Election.
The poll of 342 managers (42% of them compnay directors) was taken
before Mr Blair's successful speech to the CBI on Monday. It indicates
that 42% of them will vote Tory; 32%, Labour and 13% for the Liberal
Democrats.
The Prime Minister hopes that today's new legislation, said to be a
mixture of the commonsense and the radical, will expose Mr Blair on the
key issues of law and order and education in particular.
The Government is depending on this, plus the November 28 Budget
measures to recoup ground still being lost to Labour after the
respective autumn party conferences.
Apart from social reform measures, the Queen's Speech is designed to
establish Britain as the ''enterprise centre'' of Europe, improve
communications, information technology and transport structure.
Tougher measures against crime and the international drug barons --
with the security services being deployed against them for the first
time -- are also part of the drive to expose what the Tories see as the
gap between Mr Blair's rhetoric and reality.
The Prime Minister, in his traditional eve of Speech address to the
Carlton Club, said last night that the programme would highlight the
''common sense and success'' of Conservative policies.
''This is a positive, common sense programme that establishes the
Conservatives as the only party firmly in the centre-right of
politics,'' he said.
''It reinforces the fact that only the Conservatives offer realistic
policies for the future.''

<HEADLINE>Warning as petrol prices tumble</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PETROL prices in Scotland are the lowest in western Europe, according
to the latest survey.
But the good news was coupled with a warning that motorists in rural
parts of Scotland are still paying inflated prices at the pumps.
The AA monthly fuel price report issued yesterday also reveals that
prices have fallen throughout the UK for the fourth month in a row.
An AA spokesman said forecourt price wars had sent the cost of
four-star and unleaded petrol plummeting since the summer.
The monthly survey shows that the combined area of Scotland and
Northern Ireland is the cheapest place for a litre of both four star
(56.6p) and normal unleaded (50.6p) petrol. It has the fourth lowest
priced diesel (50.5p) after Greece, Luxembourg, and Spain. The average
UK prices for four star (57.9p), normal unleaded (52.1p) and diesel
(52.3p) are also among the lowest in Europe. Supermarket prices are
generally lower throughout the UK.
Britain has traditionally been more expensive than European countries
such as Spain and Greece, though cheaper than France or Germany. And
recent surveys showed that some areas of Scotland were the most
expensive in Britain.
But major oil companies such as Shell, Esso, and Texaco have chosen
Central Scotland and the North-east of England to launch their price
wars. Other areas which used to be expensive have cut prices to match
supermarket prices.
An AA spokesman said: ''The price war has really hotted up in the last
few months and that is great news for the customer. There has also been
a bit of pre-budget cutting to try and get prices low now in
anticipation of being hammered by the Chancellor.
''The big suppliers are in competition with each other, particularly
in built up areas and then they have to compete with supermarkets as
well.
''But there are still isolated areas where one station serves a wide
area and its prices are a lot higher, bumping up the national average.''
Mr Dermot Grimson, director of Rural Forum Scotland, said there could
be up to a 20% difference between petrol prices in, for instance,
Glasgow and the Western Isles.
Mr Grimson added: ''There may be a price war in Glasgow but in rural
areas prices are relatively high.''
The chairman of the Scottish Consumer Council (SCC), Ms Deirdre
Hutton, backed up the forum's arguments.
Ms Hutton said: ''Price cutting is fine if you live in the central
belt, but there is a very substantial differential between urban and
rural areas.''

GREAT Portland Estates increased half-time pre-tax profits by 11% to
#23.8m, partly through an increase in the surplus on properties sold of
#1.41m to #2.1m.
Chairman Richard Peskin is turning over the portfolio more actively.
Some #31m of assets were disposed of and an identical amount spent on
acquiring more rewarding sites, five of them producing a rent roll of
#2.9m annually. These include George House, Glasgow, and 52-56 Murray
Place, Stirling.
In the six months to September, net rental income rose 4.3% to #46.7m.
Mr Peskin said the level of voids had dropped to under 2% by both area
and rent roll. However, it will increase as two major developments reach
completion, although some shopping units are now being let. He added
that tenant demand remained patchy.
Second-half profits will be approximately the same as those in the
opening period, excluding investment property sales.
The interim dividend of 2.9p is held, as the full-year total will be
at 8.75p.

<FLAG>BUDGET COUNTDOWN</FLAG>

<TEXT>
In the latest of a series of pre-Budget articles written for The
Herald by leading Scottish figures in industry and commerce, Geoffrey
Maddrell, chairman of Macdonald-Martin Distilleries, producer of
Glenmorangie, argues the case for creating a climate in which
internationally competitive companies can develop
OPINION polls tell us that this Government is one of the most
unpopular ever. There are many reasons, but broken tax promises must
rank high on the list.
With promises in 1992 to cut taxes, the burden has in fact gone up
over the past three years. It should come as no surprise that the
Chancellor is looking for room to lower taxes in the coming Budget.
Tax cuts should not result in any increases in Government borrowing.
The question is then where those cuts can best be directed. Income tax
reductions, although highly visible, are not necessarily the best way of
securing long-term prosperity.
The Budget must focus on the long term, on creating the climate for
the development of internationally competitive businesses and on
encouraging higher levels of investment, in people as well as in plant.
One of Scotland's most important industries, if not the most
important, is Scotch whisky. By any standards it is a world leader, in
export revenue, geographic reach, research and development, production
technology and so on. And yet successive chancellors have succeeded in
damaging its long-term competitiveness for mythical short-term gains.
While the quality of spirit remains, even for the pleasure of the
Chancellor, the ability of the Treasury to squeeze more revenue out of
the industry has reached the point of negative returns.
He currently raises around #1700m from spirits each year. His economic
model has in the past suggested yet more could be clawed from an
industry where tax already accounts for almost 70% of the retail price.
But his model is wrong.
Following the mini-Budget last December, the Treasury claimed the
26p-a-bottle increase would raise an extra #25m a year in duty from
spirits. Six months into the fiscal year Treasury receipts from spirits
are down #54m. This is a repeat of the previous tax rise in 1992, when a
similar duty rise produced an annual #80m drop in revenue for the
Treasury.
The point of diminishing returns has been passed. It is time to break
from the mantra of higher taxes bringing more revenue and try another
way. The tax on spirits must indeed come down. This would remove the
historical anomaly of taxing Scotch whisky and other spirits at twice
the rate applied to wine and beer.
It would also create the climate for an important international
industry to achieve even higher levels of international competitiveness,
supporting employment in critically important regions of Scotland.
Let us turn now to the rest of Scottish industry and employment. The
Labour Party has said talk of tax cuts is a way of avoiding the real
issue of under-investment in British industry. There is an issue,
whatever the Government departments may say.
Although the UK already attracts more overseas investment than any
other country in the European Union, we cannot sustain that investment
if it is solely based on relatively lower labour costs. We must increase
domestic investment. But to do that we need more savings. There is a way
of achieving a higher level of savings, while at the same time involving
the majority rather than the minority of the public at large in the
wealth creation process.
Given the declining level of Government provision for old age,
sickness, education and so on, it is equally vital that we become a
nation of savers, and from a young age.
ProShare, the body which promotes individual share ownership and in
which I have a strong and enduring interest, is championing an ingenious
new savings proposal in its Budget submission. Known as STEPS (Special
Tax Exempt Personal Savings), this vehicle would enable people to choose
freely between the different forms of investment without the tax system
driving their decisions.
STEPS would enable savers to receive dividend and interest payments
tax free. Labour's proposal of Individual Savings Accounts is modelled
along similar lines. If STEPS were introduced in the Budget as a means
of building on PEPs and TESSAs, it could be supported across the
political spectrum.
The most direct way of investing in British industry is to own shares.
Direct share ownership not only gives people a stake in the business,
but it also works by encouraging a real interest in improving its
performance.
Of course, it has to be accompanied by an open and involved culture
and good management practices; it is not a panacea on its own. But we
should not underestimate the unrealised potential in most businesses --
the potential to perform better and for people to have much more
fulfilling lives.
To widen share ownership in the future and enable employees to own a
stake in their companies, ESOPs (Employer Share Ownership Plans) could
be boosted by giving them capital gains tax relief. This would also help
speed up distribution of company shares to employees.
Two Inland Revenue approved schemes, Profit Share and Sharesave, are
already in place. These should be made more flexible and attractive to
companies and their employees. Many people do not participate in them
because of the five-year timescale over which they have to set aside
savings.
Employees should be given the option to take up a short savings
contract of, say, three years. The minimum amount that can be invested
should also be brought down from #10 per month to #5, to enable
lower-paid workers to take part.
Investment can be raised through a greater emphasis on savings and
share ownership. But perhaps the best way of encouraging share ownership
would be to abolish stamp duty on share transactions. The Prime Minister
promised this in the 1992 Conservative election manifesto. It is a
promise that he surely intends to keep.

QUALITY SCOTLAND AWARDS
THREE Scottish companies were rewarded yesterday for their pursuit of
quality and business excellence.
Before an audience of 500 business people in Glasgow, representatives
of OIL (North Sea Region), Aviall Caledonian Engine Services and Rank
Xerox (Scotland) were recognised as leaders in their sectors by the
Quality Scotland Awards for Business Excellence.
Participants were judged against the internationally recognised
business excellence model issued by the European Foundation for Quality
Management.
Aberdeen-based OIL, which has the second largest offshore support
fleet in the world, was deemed the best of companies employing less than
250 people. Judges said they were impressed by its focus on customer
satisfaction.
Aviall Caledonian Engine Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aviall
Inc of Dallas, Texas, was singled out in the manufacturing category for
its emphasis on teamwork and management involvement in the pursuit of
total quality. Based in Prestwick, it employs 850 people and generates
more than #200m in annual sales revenue from its worldwide business in
engine repair and overhaul.
In the service category, Quality Scotland judges recognised Rank Xerox

<HEADLINE>Future of Fort William mill in question as cutbacks loom in carbonless sector. Arjo-Wiggins issues warning</HEADLINE>

ARJO-Wiggins-Appleton yesterday provided further evidence that the
recent upswing in pulp and paper prices has peaked.
The Anglo-French group, which owns two paper factories in Scotland,
said this year's pre-tax profit would probably fall short of last year's
#217m due to poor trading in the second half.
Arjo-Wiggins said it would rationalise its European manufacturing base
in view of this downturn, concentrating its cutbacks in the carbonless
paper sector.
This could pose a direct threat to its paper mill in Fort William, an
important freight customer of the West Highland railway line, whose
long-term future is already in doubt.
Fort William is one of several Arjo-Wiggins plants producing
carbonless paper. This is used in layers to make copies of the top
document without the need for carbon paper in between.
But Fort William plant manager Andrew Rogers said there was no
indication that his plant would be affected by any cutbacks. He noted
that it could switch out of carbonless paper into manufacturing other
products such as thermal paper and coated paper, which are used for
industrial labels.
''I have got no indication of anything which would directly affect the
mill,'' he said. The Fort William factory employs 180 and produces about
70,000 tonnes of paper per year.
Arjo-Wiggins also owns a factory at Stoneywood in Aberdeen, where 730
employees make fine uncoated fine papers for stationery.
The group said it was ''committed to a substantial programme of
investment in rationalisation and cost reduction over the next few
years'' and said this could result in provisions and write-offs
amounting to more than #100m.
Finance director Andrew Shaw said cutbacks would be focussed on the
carbonless paper sector, but he added that plans were at an early stage
and some factories could be switched to making other paper products.
''It doesn't automatically mean mills will disappear altogether.'' Mr
Shaw said.
The profits warning sent Arjo-Wiggins shares sliding 11[1/2]p to
194[1/2]p and many brokers downgraded their profits forecast for the
group. Tony Willis at BZW cut his 1995 profits projection to #195m from
#285m.
Arjo-Wiggins said issued the profits warning after de-stocking noted
in the third quarter continued longer than had been anticipated.
''No improvement from these adverse conditions is now expected in the
fourth quarter and, consequently, the the company's pre-tax profits and
earnings for 1995 could be materially lower than those of 1994,'' the
company said in a statement.
Arjo-Wiggins is the latest of several companies to warn of tougher
times to come in the paper industry following a steep increase in prices
over the past two years.
On Monday, the Norwegian industrial group Kvaerner announced losses of
70m Norwegian kroner (#7.2m) on its pulp and paper operations during the
first nine months of this year due to cost overuns on low margin
contracts.
Kvaerner made a profit of 203m kroner (#20.9m) on pulp and paper
operations during the same period last year.
And last week, Stefan Kay, managing director of the Scottish paper
firm Inveresk said he thought world paper prices had peaked, although he
forecast a stabilisation rather than a sharp fall.
Northern bleached softwood kraft, the benchmark pulp of the European
paper industry, has more than doubled in price over the last two years.
It has risen from $400 per tonne at the end of 1993 to a record high of
$950 today.
Until recently, industrial consumers had been buying paper as fast as
they could to lay in supplies before the next price rise.
But Mr Kay said resistance to a further build up of stocks set in
during the summer. Sales have fallen off because of this, leading many
firms to suspect that prices have peaked.
Alistair Irvine, paper industry analyst at Merrill Lynch, said he
expected a sharp fall in prices shortly. ''Retribution tends to be
fairly swift in situations like this,'' he said.
But he warned that prices would not fall uniformly across the sector.
Demand for newsprint was still strong, whereas the market for carbonless
paper was shrinking as electronic transactions did away with the need to
fill out forms, he noted.

ENGINEERING
PRECISION Technology, a fast-growing specialist Scottish engineering
group with its eyes on a market listing, has made its second German
acquisition in 18 months.
Precision is paying #6m for Graessner GmbH, which designs and
manufactures bevel gears at a plant near Stuttgart.
Graessner employs 100 people and has sales of DM18m (#8m). One of the
three top bevel gear-makers in Europe, its products are sold to the
robotics industry and to specialist machine manufacturers.
Precision Actuation Systems, the Scottish group's Blantyre-based
manufacturer of actuation systems, has distributed Graessner's product
range for a number of years.
The group is examining the possibility of switching some manufacturing
and sub-contract work from Germany to Scotland to reduce production
costs.
In May 1994, Precision acquired Neff Antriebstechnick Automation GmbH,
to expand its product range and give it an established sales network in
the rest of Europe.
The latest deal points to sales of #30m next year, with just under 300
people employed here and in Germany.
Chairman and chief executive Ronald Watson said: ''The acquisition of
Graessner is another significant step in the creation of a specialised
engineering group which we hope to take to market within a few years.
''This acquisition makes great strategic sense and will enhance our
market penetration.''
Deputy chief executive Norman Allison, who founded Precision with Mr
Watson in 1993, will oversee the integration of Graessner. He is also
responsible for the fourth group company, Scottish-based Precision
Cutting Systems, a start-up which is pioneering a laser device for
cutting lace at high speed.
That company recently agreed a contract to supply an eight-head
cutting machine to a large French lacemaker. The product is to be
launched on the world market next year.
Precision Actuation at Blantyre has a new managing director, Michael
Brook, previously MD of Howden Buffalo, part of the Howden Group.
On the Graessner deal, Precision Technology was advised by Arthur
Andersen Corporate Finance in Glasgow, who arranged additional equity
from 3i, Royal Bank Development Capital and members of the mangement
team.
New banking facilities have been provided by Bank of Scotland and two
German banks.

CONSTRUCTION
RAINE, the construction group which owns Hall &amp; Tawse in Aberdeen, has
plummeted to a loss of #101.8m before tax from a #13.1m profit last
year.
Chairman Roy Barber said he expected no change in the group's fortunes
until 1997.
Raine slashed its total dividend from 3p to 0.5p for the year to June
30 as earnings per share of 4.76p dived to a loss of 49.59p. No final
dividend is being paid.
The slump into the red was caused by a combination of losses of #104m
following its withdrawal from interiors contracting and commercial
property businesses.
The Derby-based group was forced to make a #23m writedown in respect
of the land and work on a US housing project known as West Venture.
''The fundamental problems in the markets in which Raine operates are
well known and subject to continual public debate,'' Mr Barber said.
''I do not anticipate any significant changes in these markets before
1997. The new homes market, which is our principal area of capital
employment and profitability, has pent-up demand.
''However, this demand will not be transformed into active investment
in new homes until our potential customers have more confidence in their
employment security and prospects. This is unlikely to happen in the
next 12 months.''
Mr Barber said the building contracting market continued to decline
and social housing was still suffering from Government spending
restrictions.
As far as Raine's operations in America are concerned, he said there
were signs of a slow recovery in the southern California economy.
''The development of new strategies and a major reorganisation of the
group's operations were necessary to enable it to regain the confidence
of its lenders and shareholders.''
To cut its capital costs, its private house building Hassall Homes
division is closing its southern region and those funds will be
channelled into the land bank of its other regions.
The number of homes sold by Hassall in July and August was lower than
the corresponding two months last year and the group warned that
completions in the half year to the end of December were likely to be
about 24% down.
Raine, which has secured renewed bank facilities, has closed its
commercial property business as well as its Plumb interiors contracting
operations, whose offices and factory are now up for sale.

LEISURE
THE Copthorne Hotel group is to be floated next spring by its new
Singaporean owner, CDL Group.
The flotation on the London Stock Exchange is pencilled in for next
March. Between 25% and 40% of the share capital is expected to be
available to investors.
The 16-chain Copthorne business, which includes sites in Glasgow and
Aberdeen, was acquired by CDL from Aer Lingus in October for #219m. The
acquisition enabled CDL to become one of the UK's largest hotel groups,
typically competing in the four-star market against Queens Moat Hotels.
As part of a marketing exercise CDL has grouped its hotels business
under a new global brand, Millennium Hotels and Resorts, reinforcing its
commitment to become a major player in the world hotel industry.
Despite signs of an economic slowdown in the UK, Peter Taylor,
regional director, said business was booming. As part of its development
plans, further hotels could be acquired in gateway cities such as
Edinburgh, where it is not represented.
CDL Group is the listed arm of the Hong Leong Group in Singapore. A
steady programme of global expansion in the past six years has led to it
owning 55 hotels with 14,378 rooms in 11 countries.

THE sun is shining warmly on gases, healthcare and distribution group
BOC, and there are few clouds likely to cast a significant pall over
prospects for the forseeable future.
Retiring chief executive Pat Dyer, who hands over to Danny Rozenkranz
in the New Year, said he was generally optimistic and ''these are good
times''.
That was after the group announced record annual profits. It enjoyed a
13% rise in pre-tax profits to #402m on turnover up 8% to #3544m.
But behind the full-year figure is the crucial point that the trend of
profitability is accelerating -- the September quarter shot ahead by
16%.
Underlying the optimisim is the growth in orders on 15-year contracts.
In the past year BOC has signed deals that will result in an additional
15,000 tonnes of gas a day at on-site plants to complement the 30,000
tonnes built up in the preceding 109 years of its history. The largest
is a 2800-tonnes-a-day monster for US Steel which will also produce 120
tonnes of argon -- a gas which is completely sold out in the US.
There have been price increases in both the US and the UK, leading gas
margins to rise year-on-year from 13.4% to 14.2% and to 14.9% in the
last quarter.
There have been gains in almost all territories except Japan. There
profitability is inadequate and BOC is still thinking about what to do,
although the labour release position is becoming more favourable. The
dilemma is that quitting is not really an option as many Japanese
semi-conductor manufactures will also use BOC technology in their
overseas subsidiaries which is much better business for the gases group.
Healthcare profits advanced 8% to #59.8m with growth inhibited, as
expected, by the Forane anaesthetic gas range running out of patent.
However, while that lost 50% of its market share, its successor,
Surprane, is making up some of the leeway. BOC has signed up with Baxter
Healthcare to provide Forane as part of a hospital package, while it is
also developing injectable anaesthetics in a major joint venture.
The star performance came from the vacuum and distribution division.
Its fourth quarter profits were ahead 56%, while for the full year the
advance was 38% to #70.8m. That reflects in part Edwards receiving 50%
of all global orders for high purity gas equipment such as pumps and
which find a huge market in electronics.
The low-cost UK base is a decided help in developing export markets.
However, the distribution business suffered from a downturn in profits
from the Interbrands ambient temperature operations -- the whole
distribution sector does seem to be suffering.
The City liked the story and the shares rose 12p to 876p where they
sell at 14[1/2] times likely earnings.
The dividend total for next year has been raised 9% to 27p -- BOC
forecasts a year in advance -- for a prospective 3.8% yield, a very
solid long-term investment which should now begin to show
out-performance.

AEROSPACE
ROLLS-Royce has won a major order for its biggest engine, the Trent,
which has been selected by Singapore Airlines (SIA) to power the 777
twin-jet airliners it has ordered from Boeing.
News of the #1200m order caused a stir in the stock market, where
Rolls shares soared 11[1/2]p to 172[1/2]p in heavy trade. The work will
be spread over a number of years with deliveries beginning in 1997. A
Rolls spokesman said it was ''most unlikely'' that the group would be
taking on more staff.
The parts for the engines would be assembled in Derby. Components for
the order would be made in factories in Derby, Bristol, Coventry and
Scotland as well as overseas, he added.
''Singapore Airlines is respected as one of the most professional
airlines in the world, and this order is a significant endorsement for
the qualities of the Trent engine,'' said John Rose, managing director
of Rolls Aerospace. ''SIA is the ninth customer to select the Trent and
this order takes the Trent order book to #2500m.''
The airline will buy 157 Trent engines including 35 spares. Delivery
of the 777s will be phased to give SIA an annual rise in capacity of 8%
to 10% over the next 10 years, to cater for growth in traffic in the
economically fast-expanding Asia-Pacific area.
The 777 was chosen in preference to the A330, partly because it has
10% more capacity, according to SIA. Airbus said it was disappointed,
though a spokesman pointed out that the company had 17 firm orders for
the A340 from SIA and other sales campaigns were continuing.
In a separate planned deal, Rolls has signed a 10-year agreement with
management consultancy EDS worth #600m. EDS will assume responsibility
for Rolls Aerospace's information technology network. Under this deal
around 750 staff will be transferred to EDS.

THIRD-quarter profits of General Accident took a predictable dip
though the group considers the underlying trend is in line with
expectations.
As a result of #38m of extreme weather losses, profits in the three
months to September fell 22% to #93m. Hurricane Marilyn accounted for
#10m of the weather loss, though UK subsidence cost #12m. The balance
came in North America.
Nine-month profits were still 7% ahead at #346.6m. The contribution
from life business was well ahead at #44.9m against #37m. The group
hopes to complete its acquisition of Provident Mutual by the end of the
year.
''New business production in the UK has been maintained at an
encouraging level -- against the market trend,'' commented outgoing
group chief executive Nelson Robertson.
Competition in household and motor rates pushed the UK underwriting
surplus down sharply from #64.6m to #15.1m. But deputy chairman Barrie
Holder stressed that rates were not about to tumble.
''There is no falling off the precipice in the UK and things are still
under control,'' he commented. Motor rates steadied in the third quarter
and GA believes they have bottomed out. Mr Holder said the group
intended to review its rates shortly.
Over the nine months, motor premium income declined 9% owing to lower
premiums but also better claims experience.
The underwriting surplus in the homeowners' account fell sharply in
the third quarter owing largely to the subsidence claims. One area of
growth was in sickness and redundancy insurance which accounted for much
of the 13% increase in ''other'' personal lines premium income to #238m
in the nine months.
The most competitive area at present is commercial property,
particularly in the mid-value range where reductions of 10% and 15% have
been going through.
The recovery in the US was maintained in the third quarter when the
underwriting deficit was cut from #27.3m to #19.5m despite higher
catastrophe losses which hit commercial property. There was a good
improvement in the involuntary motor account and personal property was
better.
Canada saw a small upturn despite #8m of hailstorm and tornado losses.
The deterioration in Australia was halted in the third quarter despite
further reserving.
Losses increased sharply in Europe outside the UK to #6.4m as a result
of run-offs of old business, large claims in France and continuing
adverse experience in Germany.
* INSURANCE broker Sedgwick almost maintained profits for the nine
months to September at #76.5m against #78.7m on a 1% increase in
revenue.
The group said that against a background of increasingly competitive
markets and a further softening of rates its brokerage and fees in the
European and US retail businesses continued to grow. The UK showed an 8%
improvement. It added that it remained cautious about conditions in the
industry.

PROPERTY
A LEADING Glasgow surveyor has successfully spearheaded a #2.7m
management buy-out from Abbey National.
The buy-out of surveying firm J Trevor &amp; Webster was led by Fraser
Livingston who now becomes managing director of the firm. He will
oversee 11 branches, including three in Scotland and a London HQ.
While owned by Abbey National, J Trevor &amp; Webster was created last
year through a merger of Glasgow surveyors Webster &amp; Co and
English-based J Trevor &amp; Sons.
Abbey National was initially reluctant to countenance a buy-out, but
after protracted negotiations and an analysis of its future role in
commercial property, the deal was agreed.
''Abbey National was a fine company to work for,'' said Fraser
Livingston. ''But commercial surveying was a tiny part of their
operation -- we were like a pimple on the backside of an elephant. I
started to worry that I'd wake up one day and find that we had been sold
to someone else. The management buy-out will protect all of our
interests, surveyors and support staff alike.''
Mr Livingston is moving to London to head up the new firm, but he does
not expect the move to be permanent. His family is staying on in
Glasgow. ''As soon as everything is working smoothly in London, I'll
spend much more time in Scotland. This buy-out will bring a boost to our
Scottish offices since we will now be part of a regional network of
surveyors with an office in London.
''This is a very Scottish deal -- McGrigor Donald looked after the
legal side and the Clydesdale acts as our banker.''
The buy-out was funded by share subscription and borrowings, no
venture capital was involved.

CLASSICAL MUSIC
Leading world-class orchestras seems a long way from listening to
village tunes in deep China. But, as Michael Tumulty explains, the
evolution for Tan Dun has been as natural as the music he writes and
offers to the people
The audience should feel part of the cast, it is a dramatic,
theatrical event
CLEAR your throats. Prepare to hum. And chant. Tan Dun is in town,
ready to involve his audience in an unusual musical-theatrical
experience.
A few months back, a large London Prom audience at the Albert Hall was
just about to join in (literally) with the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra for the UK premiere of the Chinese composer-conductor's
Orchestral Theatre II, when the lights went out.
A power failure plunged the Albert Hall into darkness and closed the
unblinking eyes of the BBC's television cameras, leaving retiring Proms
supremo John Drummond with no option but to announce that the concert
would have to be abandoned.
Prestigious though the event would have been for all concerned,
there's a not unpleasant irony in the fact that the delayed premiere of
Tan's individualistic composition will take place in Glasgow tomorrow
night.
Earlier this year, Tan Dun was appointed associate composer/conductor
to the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, and he has yet to make his debut
here in that role. So it's appropriate that it will be with a work as
yet unheard in the UK that he will make his first official appearance
tomorrow in one of the BBC SSO's Cutting Edge series of concerts.
And it sounds like quite a work. Orchestral Theatre II (its precursor,
Orchestral Theatre I will also be played tomorrow night) was
commissioned from Tan for the Suntory Hall in Tokyo by Japanese composer
Toru Takemitsu.
Tan describes it as an opera for orchestra and audience. ''Not in the
sense of a traditional opera,'' the composer says. ''More like a ritual
opera -- it's non-fictional, there's no story.''
Though there's no programme or plot, Tan describes it as ''a very
dramatic, theatrical event, involving tension, contrasts, the fighting
of ideas, the fighting of dreams and realities.''
It also involves a spatially deployed orchestra, two conductors, and
the audience. One conductor -- Tan himself -- will direct the audience
(which will be rehearsed before the concert) and the 11 woodwind players
spread among them. The other -- SSO conductor laureate Jerzy Maksymiuk
-- will direct the larger body of the orchestra.
The concept behind the whole thing, says Tan, is one of integration.
''There is no division, no difference between playing and singing,
between performing and listening -- the audience should feel part of the
cast.''
It's a concept specifically influenced by Tibetan and Eastern operatic
and temple cultures, says Tan. ''It's a non-religious ritual about the
spirit and the cycle of nature.''
The work is subtitled Re, which has a double meaning. The word Re is
the musical note D. ''The whole piece is on one pitch,'' says Tan.
''There is only the note D. I treat it like calligraphy: one single
brush stroke with so many complicated counterpoints and colours in it.
I'm using a minimal idea to carry the most complicated thoughts.''
The other meaning of Re is more philosophical. ''It is in language, as
in revolution, renew, restart, refine. It is about something cyclical,
about a continuity that you find in nature, in the seasons, in the
continuity of the human spirit.''
And it is also, he says, about the notion of returning. He described
both Orchestral Theatre pieces as ''very much a recalling experience of
my childhood.''
Tan was born in 1957 and brought up in Si Mao village, a rural area in
what he calls ''deep China'', steeped in ancient culture and somewhat
isolated, even for the China of its day. ''Before I was 20 I had no
chance to listen to or study Western music because of the cultural
revolution -- it wasn't allowed.
''Also, I was living in a remote village; so I experienced more the
Eastern ritual culture of the Hunan region -- the same mountain area as
Mao Tse-tung came from.''
His early impressions of music were strictly in relation to village
life. ''It was not a performing art; it was part of life, played by
farmers, sung by villagers, with instruments like the bamboo flute and
skin drums. Music was associated with weddings, funerals, festivals and
rituals.''
His formal training in Beijing was limited to shamanistic songs, local
or Chinese instruments -- fiddles and flutes -- and what he calls
''strange dancing''. Any awareness of Western music was severely
restricted by the authorities, he says. ''It was actually dangerous to
study the western avant garde.''
Leaving China in 1986 to study in New York came as a ''complete
shock'' to the system as he reversed his ''viewing of the world from a
China point of view''. Another shock came as he began to recognise ''the
colours and sounds from my home town'' in primitive musics of American
Indians, early Europeans and Africans.
Additionally, as he studied, he found his own creative language ''more
and more going back to this traditional experience of ritual; I find,
idealistically, a bridge between western avant-garde music and the
primitive culture of ritual in my musical language.''
He is not, he claims, trying to force these elements together on the
concert stage; they are just part of his musical make-up. ''Orchestral
Theatre 1 and 11 are witnesses to what I'm doing now and to how I
learned music as a child.''
Tan now returns to China annually for concerts. He describes his
country as ''fast opening'', though he says the government is ''uneasy''
about concepts of freedom. ''They need more education, more knowledge,
more exchange; but it's not very easy for the government, for a people
so used to being closed.''
There is, he says, a dramatic cultural change in his country as it
witnesses an invasion of fast culture. ''Commercial culture is the first
priority -- rock'n'roll, Broadway shows, bar culture and the disco.''
And do they listen to Tan? ''It's happening. This country is just
suddenly opening. There is big cultural confusion and shock. But we
represent a hungry generation; there is an audience that wants
challenging things -- new music, new art. But the government doesn't
support it because of commercial circumstances.''
It is, however, easier for the new generation of Chinese composers, he
says. ''We opened up the bridge. What we experienced when we composed,
or suffered, is history; and the young people now follow and support
us.''
Tan Dun conducts the BBC SSO, tomorrow, Henry Wood Hall, 7.30pm.

Strathclyde University, still expanding its musical empire against the
trend, will tomorrow announce the residency of the acclaimed Rachmaninov
Trio
SOMEBODY should tell Strathclyde University that the arts are supposed
to be in recession. As music organisations throughout the country battle
for funding and, in some cases, for survival, Strathclyde University
quietly goes on expanding what is beginning to resemble a musical
empire.
The BA in Applied Music at the Jordanhill campus continues to grow,
the university is establishing firm links with the Royal Concert Hall's
annual folk festival, Celtic Connections, last month saw the launch of
the National Jazz Institute, and tomorrow the university will announce
the appointment of the Rachmaninov Trio as trio in residence to the
university.
The Glasgow-based trio -- two Russians and an American -- only made
their debut at Mayfest 18 months ago, and instantly attracted attention
for the mature quality both of their sound and technique. They were born
fully-formed.
Numerous performances on, and with a growing reputation, the
Rachmaninov Trio will now establish a real root in the cultural seedbed
of Glasgow, with regular performances in Strathclyde University's
concert network and a presence on the Jordanhill campus.
They will give one flagship performance per year for the university,
and at least one appearance per season in the university's lunchtime
series of concerts.
Details of the group's commitments in its three-year residency are
still being worked out, but, said Alan Tavener, director of music at the
university, it will probably extend beyond mere recitals. The trio is
likely, for example, to team up with the university orchestra and
chorus, and may undertake special projects involving surveys of
particular composers.
The trio will perform tomorrow night at a dinner in the Barony Hall to
launch the university's bicentenary celebrations, and will almost
certainly feature in a Barony Hall bicentenary series of concerts next
October.
On the Jordanhill campus the trio will work with students of the BA in
Applied Music. Here their work is likely to embrace involvement with
student chamber ensembles, workshops on student compositions, and
lectures on chamber music.
Basic costs of the residency -- principally artists' fees -- are being
met by an unnamed family trust, which wishes to stay in the background.
Any costs to the university will be on the promotional side of the
group's appointment.
Strathclyde has chosen well. The trio -- American pianist Phillip
Silver, violinist and violist Lev Atlas, and cellist Sasha Volpov (the
two Russians are former members of the Rostov String Quartet) -- have a
tremendous technical armoury and a rich, dark, unmistakably East
European sound. Glasgow's musical life, as well as that of the
university itself, will be enriched by their increased presence on the
scene.

Music
TO hear the Zanfonia Trio (violin, clarinet, piano) a day after the
Barbican Trio (violin, cello, piano) is to be made aware of the
difference a change of instrument can bring about. Both in repertoire
and sound quality, Tuesday's concert shifted away from the classical
mainstream, replacing it with Stravinsky, Bartok, Ives, and a recent
work by Ruth Byrchmore that considerably extended the range of timbres
without increasing the quantity of performers.
It was a cleverly devised programme, in which the suite from
Stravinsky's Soldier's Tale formed just the right pungent aperitif, each
of its five movements as dry as a shot of vodka. The three young
players, latest winners of the John Tunnell Trust Prize, attacked its
rhythms head-on, with a confidence that augured well for the rest of the
evening. Ives's Largo, which needed a quite different, more mystical
approach, proved equally compelling, but the poetic fantasising of
Schumann's Marchenerzahlungen, written just before his date with the
madhouse, sounded duller than it should have done.
There was no doubt, however, about the conviction behind Ruth
Byrchmore's Golden Shadows, even if one questioned the wisdom of reading
aloud the Christina Rossetti poem that inspired it.
The dense, pounding piano chords and long clarinet lines with which it
opened spoke quite eloquently enough for themselves, as did the wry,
jangly music into which they led. A lithe, incisive account of Bartok's
Contrasts ended the first of the season's New Town Concerts as pungently
as it began.

INSPIRED by the writing of psychoanalyst Alice Miller -- the opening
speech paraphrasing her remark that murderers do not fall out of the
clear blue sky -- Swedish dramatist Niklas Radstrom's play is a
disquieting account of the early life of Adolf Hitler.
It's a shocking, stylised study of the legacy of brutalisation which
makes manifest the connections between personal violence and that
executed on a global scale. It not only acts as ''an elegy for the child
who was destroyed'' it also crystalises the gulf between European and
British theatre for young people.
Pitched at school children this is highly literate, sophisticated
drama which dares to make demands of its audiences, a disturbing but
scintillating work distinguished by first-class performances from the
Oxford Stage Company.
Meriel Scholfield is superb as Adolf's tyrannised mother, Gareth Corke
is terrifyingly unhinged as the schizoid Aunt Johanna, tormenting young
Adolf with bedtime tales of boy-eating monsters and perhaps presaging a
revenge programme of euthanasia for the mentally ill, while Malcolm
Scates's bully of a father bears the scars and welts of another
childhood destroyed, thus emphasising cyclical brutality.
Michael Matus bristles with fear as a young Adolf learning to stifle
an imagination and inner-child represented by Tassia Messimeris. The
climatical energy of the play was somewhat drained by the interruption
of the fire alarm, but this was a remarkable, memorable production none
the less.
Less intriguing was the companion piece of this double bill. Ignace
Cornelissen's Grace, a contemporaneous update of the Cinderella fable,
is an entertaining but flimsy play which seems all the more
insubstantial in comparison to the tension of the preceding work.

Theatre
THE last time Shakespeare's stormy fantasy was brewed up at Tramway
was, as I recall, in Peter Brook's elemental Francophone La Tempete.
Where Brook's elements of choice were earth and water, Romanian director
Silviu Purcarete goes for the celestial element of music.
His Prospero, in this Nottingham Play House/Theatr Clwyd co-production
is as much musician as magician, his stick more baton than wand,
orchestrating the action like a symphonic score. Played by Michael
Fitzgerald beneath a taut web of piano wire, he is self-contained,
deeply sad, a little frightening, and, like a master composer,
all-controlling. He is Mozart to Antonio's Salieri (Stephen Tindall),
and even Miranda and Ferdinand (a boyish Saira Todd and a
less-than-animated Stephen Mangan) are more like crotchets in his
composition than voices free to sing in their own right.
Purcarete in turn is the true orchestrator, transforming Ariel into a
blood-drained string ensemble and a disembodied voice, and investing
this marvellous production with stunning visual touches. Performed on a
bare white stage, this island suggests alternately some heavenly Eden
and the ghost of an unreachable past, its occupants pallid in white
robes and wigs. It's alive with sure and simple visual moments --
burning musical scores, Caliban carrying a giant skeleton, an explosive
birthday cake -- and all focused clearly on the production's underlying
theme.
It is not without its weak points -- the romance fails to ignite, the
poetry of Ariel and Caliban is lost, and the comic scenes begin to drag
-- but it would be churlish to complain when the compensation is an
interpretation that is truly magical, divinely musical, and quite
unmissable.

YOU MAY not want to miss it -- then again you just might -- but the
timing of the enterprise is immaculate, whatever anyone thinks. ''The
Counterfeit Company presents The Bootleg Beatles in Concert. The Magic
of the Fab Four . . . Spectacularly Re-created on Stage''.
According to the Daily Telegraph the show is ''fastidiously
authentic'' and not, judging by 26 planned tour dates, barren of profit.
Most of England and Wales, a night at Dundee's Caird Hall, a night at
the Usher Hall in Edinburgh, and two entire nights at Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall.
Who said dead stars no longer shine? You can't blame the Bootleg
Beatles, whoever they are. The mannequins have the example of their
namesakes before them, or at least of the surviving trio and Lennon's
widow. If Paul, George, Ringo, and Yoko are eager to squeeze the last
hundred or so millions from the Beatles' legend, why shouldn't anyone
else with the wit or effrontery get in on the act?
What's the difference, after all, between watching someone pretend to
be John Lennon and buying a dodgy, doctored recording of the dead man's
voice to which, 18 years on, his former colleagues have added music? If
people are willing to purchase copies of take nine of I Saw Her Standing
There, and ''incomplete'' takes 12 and 13 of This Boy, as the Beatles
and their record company confidently expect, what does authenticity
really mean?
McCartney and the other survivors at least admit they don't need the
money. Apple-cheeked Paul is already a half-billionaire; George and
Ringo aren't quite reduced to busking. Last year, without actually doing
anything much, they made more than $100m from the Beatles. Even before
the merciless hype accompanying their forthcoming ITV documentary series
and a new album of old songs, their back catalogue was shifting upwards
of three million units a year.
Greed cannot be discounted, if it ever could be. The distinguishing
feature of that magical back catalogue since the band broke up has been
its pricing. Recordings which recouped their costs (and then some)
decades ago are still being sold, apparently at the insistence of Apple,
the Beatles' company, at full, inflated CD price. Love may be all you
need, but money's nice too.
THE contradictions involved in all this are grotesque, to put it
mildly. For years the survivors insisted they would never reform. Lennon
said the dream was over and when he died the others appeared to accept
the fact, obvious to all save demented American promoters, that without
him the chemistry of the band couldn't be reproduced, that it would
somehow be wrong even to try.
Now they are re-united electronically, casually, a kind of icy virtual
resurrection into which questions of taste have not, so it seems,
intruded. Old, once discarded recordings are being disinterred,
middle-aged men are rendered adolescent again on the television screen,
and a generation is given back its youth -- for a price.
But the taste it leaves is sour. For six bare years the Beatles
achieved a kind of perfection in popular culture. No-one was bigger,
no-one better, and no-one defined their moment so completely. Most
important of all, no-one else embodied their medium with such style and
with such an absolute understanding of what it -- the simple popular
song -- was meant to do.
The reward was huge wealth, a fame impossible to comprehend, and the
affection, even love, of half the world. The astounding response to
Lennon's murder in 1980, that tidal wave of emotion for a performer
whose best days were long behind him, explained the Beatles better than
a library of books.
Now the tomb is to be stripped bare. The Beatles Anthology album, due
out in good time for Christmas, with its suckers and sentiment, is to
comprise music the group chose not to release when they were at their
peak.
We are offered the magic that failed, the art that did not bewitch,
the stuff that didn't make the cut. If you were young in the sixties it
resembles an offence against nature: a Beatles record that isn't any
good.
Who ever heard of that? This boy, who once bought anything with the
band's name on it the moment it hit the shops, doesn't want an ''insight
into how the records were made''. He doesn't seek to have a perfect
moment annotated or explained.
Most of all, he doesn't much want to watch the Beatles, of all people,
looting their own past. Let it be.

NOTHING in my time has aroused so much political passion in Scotland
as the Ravenscraig steelworks. The place was in fact doomed from the day
it opened in 1959. The then chairman of Colville's, Sir Andrew McCance,
had predicted as much very forcefully behind the scenes. Harold
Macmillan's Tory Government took no notice, twisted his arm, and made
him build it. It duly ruined his company, a proud name in Scottish
industry if ever there was one.
The country's worship of this white elephant in no way diminished.
Nationalisation followed, and I suppose that made it even more sacred. A
people's steelworks was obviously just the right thing for a nation of
hard men in hard hats, where you were not considered to be seriously
working unless wearing a boiler suit and carrying an oilcan.
It made no difference that Scotland was in reality undergoing rapid
development into a post-industrial economy. This would have been better
buying what steel it needed from Venezuela or Korea, where the quality
of production was as good and the cost of production less than half. But
they were not allowed to sell to us. Nobody stopped to tot up how many
Scottish jobs were lost or never created in the other sectors forced to
rely on dear steel rather than cheap steel.
Instead we had the frantic campaigns of the 1980s and the 1990s to
keep Ravenscraig open at any price. Few pretended that the works were
much good as they stood. The contrary evidence spoke too clearly. No,
but if there was investment, all would be well. Yet investment needs
some prospect of a satisfactory return. To make a bad investment is
worse than to make no investment, because you lose twice over: you throw
away the money you spend, while you fail to show the profit it could
otherwise have earned. And McCance had rightly forecast that Ravenscraig
would never offer a satisfactory return.
This simple point could not penetrate the hard hats, though the thick
skulls of the politicians elected by their wearers doubtless had more to
do with the matter. The argument now advanced instead was the eternal
last resort of the economically illiterate scoundrel, that 20,000 other
jobs depended on the steelworks, that the entire livelihood of North
Lanarkshire lay in peril. Even ScotRail would collapse once it no longer
trundled coal and ore to Ravenscraig.
It was amazing how such mournful themes twanged at Scots'
heartstrings. I was Conservative candidate for East Lothian in the
election of 1983 and I recall Michael Ancram, my predecessor in the
seat, advising me to mount a two-pronged campaign, that the Tories had
saved the Union, and that the Tories had saved Ravenscraig (not for much
longer, in the event; anyway, I declined on both counts). When the axe
finally and inevitably fell in 1992, one Scottish newspaper -- I can
forgive it, since I was not working there at the time -- portentously
announced that this ''effectively completed the de-industrialisation of
Scotland.''
Whatever de-industrialisation might mean in a country where 70% of the
people were no longer working in industry anyway, the clamour has turned
out to be empty, and the claims behind it bogus.
An inquiry into the closure now shows that its effect was in fact
rather minor, and ironed out before long. Just more than 3000 lost their
jobs on the day the steelworks doused its fires for the last time, and
another 2000 from suppliers in the area followed them on to the dole.
Unemployment is never to be welcomed, but it may usefully be pointed out
that the increase amounted to only one-quarter of that predicted by the
more lurid lamentations at the time.
The story did not end there, however. Not all these men were left to
languish on street corners for the rest of their lives. Various training
schemes were put in place, and initiatives to attract incoming firms,
the first not very successful, the second somewhat more so. Whether the
official interventions had any value or not, the fact remains that well
over half those who lost their jobs are today in new ones. Of the
others, a good many have retired, as they might have done anyway by now.
The trend rate of unemployment in North Lanarkshire has returned to what
it was before.
In that sense it is as if the closure of Ravenscraig never happened.
The local economy may not be the most dynamic in the world, but the
dousing of the steelworks' fires has basically made little difference to
it. How can we explain this?
All economies -- even those like North Lanarkshire's on which the dead
hand of the state lies heavy -- still change and develop in certain
ways. Every year a few of their businesses fold regardless of general
conditions, while fresh ones spring up. The process is not only
inevitable but also healthy, because capital and labour are constantly
released from outworn uses, ready to be deployed for better ones. If, to
make the point explicit, there had not been skilled men and experienced
suppliers available to welcome and work for Chung Hwa at Mossend, then
the Koreans would have been less likely to come, quite apart from any
other incentives involved.
This is the way the world works. It is like the Scottish weather -- it
may not always be very pleasant, but we just have to put up with it if
we are to live here at all. The worst possible thing is to try to resist
the process, because that spends time, energy, and money to no purpose,
and makes us poorer than we need be. Perhaps, though, there is one worse
thing, which is to invest such resistance with an immature proletarian
romanticism. If the history of Ravenscraig lets us get over that, then
this tale of hard hats and thick skulls may indeed have a happy ending.

GEORGE ROBERTSON, MP for Hamilton, got a bit of a shock when listening
to a BBC Radio Scotland bulletin on Monday morning. ''I heard the words
'Division Lobby' and 'today' and I sat bolt upright, thinking 'My God,
I've forgotten something.''' His worries subsided, though, as he settled
down to hear the rest of the previous Monday's news, including the PM's
optimistic suggestion that the House would vote with him on the Nolan
Report. The BBC broadcast three bulletins -- 6.30, 7.00, and 7.30 --
before George telephoned their political correspondent Kenny MacIntyre
to find out what was going on.
BBC Scotland have confirmed that they received no calls from Tory MPs,
or for that matter, from anyone else. Not one single call on this
subject, apart from George's, was received. Maybe it's because the news
is so boring. Newsreader James Gillies, who read the bulletins, could
not be contacted for comment.
Suggestions for more interesting past news items, eg ''Titanic
successfully launched'', will be gratefully received.
Clootie with clout
A NEW (ish -- it's a reprint) look at Clootie City called, with that
vaulting leap of the imagination which transcends mere genius, The
Dundee Book, is now in the shops. The city may have developed a bit but
a line or two about the town council of the 1550s takes the eye: ''Ony
person be fundin disobeying any one bearing office within the burgh . .
. sall come to the Mercat Croce and upon his knees desire forgiveness.''
The city's ruling Labour group maintains this fine tradition, as
several of its members have discovered.
Funny money
WE received a postcard at Diary HQ the other day urging us not to
forget the birthday of our ''rich Uncle Pennybags''. Briefly euphoric at
the thought of a distant wealthy relative prepared to shower us with
cash, we were disappointed to learn that rich Uncle Pennybags is
actually the new top-hatted symbol for every megalomaniac's favourite
board game, Monopoly.
To celebrate the game's 60th anniversary this Friday, the makers are
hosting a posh pairty in the Park Lane Hotel in London. We hear that
hotels in that neighbourhood are selling in the region of #75m, so,
spurred on by thoughts of lucrative property deals, the Diary fully
intends to trot down and offer to buy said hotel.
As recommended by our very own Monopoly board, we are going in with a
closing offer of #1350 (the initial purchase price of #350 plus cost of
the five houses necessary for a hotel), in nice pink and yellow notes.
Cross your fingers.
Gastrognomes
THERE are further thoughts on footballing food from Mark Allan of
Carmyle who writes to suggest that we should be concentrating on
specialities that are traditional rather than European, though he does
mention that there is plenty of crepe around.
He reckons that Scottish teams are unable to blend the ingredients for
that true European flavour because of their difficulties in finding the
onion bag and the fact that they just can't get pasta Italiano, though
they have had experience in French toasting and in not terribly
sauerkraut.
Back home, it has been suggested to the Diary that should Derek
Johnstone ever decide to branch out into the restaurant trade, ''The
Rotunda'' would be a fitting title for his gastronomical gaff.
Our keen financial eye also notes that the catering company which is
part of the vast Ibrox empire and provides its half-time oranges and the
like, is ending the year in considerable profit. Could this be something
to do with the aforesaid Mr Johnstone eating there these days? And have
we at last discovered the identity of which overweight gentleman ate all
the pies?
And finally, we hope, as our boys in darker blue take on the might of
San Marino, a last word on failure in Europe. What is the difference
between the Rangers' defence and the Old Course at St Andrews? The
Rangers' defence has more holes and the Old Course plays better.
Fall guy
WE note with regret, from the public notices of this very blatt on
November 6, that a company called Guy Penny Ltd is being wound up,
presumably because of the failure of the public to dish out the required
copper coin.
On the same day, 24 hours in advance of the Herald poll showing a
serious slump in support for the tartan lads and lassies of the Nats, a
company called Flagship (Scotland) Ltd was the subject of a winding-up
petition by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. What did she have
on board? A stash of dope(s)? The hopes and dreams of a once proud and
free nation, perhaps?

I MUST congratulate Stewart Lamont on his splendid article on the
possible rediscovery of our national soul, in which he contends that
''people seem less prepared to give the war dead their due'', and that
''even two minutes is too much to ask'' (November 11).
The truth of this was well and truly confirmed on Sunday, November 12,
at a village war memorial service, where the interlude of silence was
shamefully debased by an irreverent chorus of restless car engines,
impatiently waiting to pass between the assembled company and myself,
while one frustrated driver succeeded in passing through at the moment
of the benediction.
Yes indeed, for many people two minutes is too much to ask. For me
personally, and I have never lived through the war years, two minutes
will never be enough.

WHEN the Most Reverend Richard Holloway asks if God is a
fundamentalist, as he did last night, he takes the risk of being
misunderstood, which is the hallmark of any searching and innovative
churchman. He has suffered criticism on previous occasions because his
views have been either misunderstood or misrepresented or both, and no
doubt he will suffer it again. Yet in questioning the status, use, and
validity of the Bible he is doing little more than treading an already
well-worn path. None the less it is a path which many still seek to
tramp, making the questioning of the Bible a sort of West Highland Way
of the Christian faith. Bishop Holloway condemns idolatry while very
properly identifying it as the product of the human need for security
and permanence. Yet for him, to ascribe absolute power and authority to
the Bible, as he claims Christian fundamentalists do, is in itself a
form of idolatry. This may be so, but when Bishop Holloway goes on to
claim that the Bible is still a useful (such a slighting word) guide but
that it is a creature of its time and that its morality is time
conditioned, he is on less steady ground.
There is not space here to deal with his arguments in full, but his
assertion that moralities change from era to era, if not from generation
to generation, is indeed difficult for many people to swallow. He uses
this to question the modern validity of the commandment not to commit
adultery, citing the change in the status of women as somehow modifying
the commandment. Yet what he may be doing here is to confuse changes in
culture and society with what he calls changes in moralities, thereby
assuming that there is no such thing as a moral absolute. Here is a
different way of looking at it. The commandment says it is wrong to
kill, yet one society might interpret this as condemning the waste of a
useful unit of production while another might bemoan the loss of
something precious and unique. Societies and the way they interpret
morals change; it is still wrong to kill.

YOUR report of the meeting convened by the Scottish Socialist Movement
to discuss the formation of a new left-wing party mentions the presence
of the Communist Party of Scotland (November 13).
I am writing to make it clear that the Communist Party of Britain does
not at this stage support this aim -- even though we are implacably
opposed to the right-wing trend of the current Labour Party leadership
and see it as directly prejudicial to Labour's electoral prospects.
The real question is how these policies are best defeated and how the
great mass of Labour voters can be won to see the need for a socialist
alternative.
Splitting the left from the Labour Party would weaken the battle for
progressive policies inside the Labour Party. It would also make it
easier for Tony Blair to cut the crucial links that remain with the
trade-union movement.
Nor would a split within the Labour Party at this stage be understood
by the voters. People want the Tories out.
The key test will come if and when Labour is elected. It is then that
the Blair leadership will, almost certainly, move into conflict with the
trade-union movement and do so in the context of heightened expectations
among voters and trade unionists.
It is vital that the left is still present at this point to battle for
the future of the party which the trade-union movement founded.

I HAVE no aversion to paying for something that may be of use or
benefit. In common with most Scots I would be happy to pay a few pence
more in income tax to improve the health service, better fund education,
or make it possible for local government to deliver a decent level of
services.
In particular, I would be more than happy for the Government to take a
few more pence that would be directly used to create work for the
unemployed.
There is evidence all around us of work that needs to be done. And
even more vivid illustration of the destruction that is visited on
society when huge sections of the population are denied work and reduced
to impoverished dependency on inadequate benefits.
What is the point of subsidising people out of work when they can be
subsidised in work at little greater cost? If we are to have any
prospect of a happy, lawful, non-violent, and successful society gainful
employment must be provided for all who want to work -- at whatever
cost.
It is merely a matter of spending priorities. Tax cuts or jobs?
Trident or jobs? The social barbarism of market forces or jobs?
In the context of a sensible use of available resources I will have a
determined aversion to paying for Labour's Scottish ''parliament''. I
can think of much better ways of spending taxation revenues than in
paying for an extra and unnecessary parliament whose powers will be
limited to relatively minor adjustments of policy decided in the real
Parliament in London.
I will object most strongly to paying the salaries and allowances of
129 SMPs and the whole costly Civil Service apparatus that will surround
them when I know they can make no important decisions and the only
significant function this ''parliament'' is likely to fulfil is to fuel
anti-English sentiment in Scotland -- and anti-Scottish sentiment in
England!
Scotland and England have been together too long to be compromised by
this patently ill-considered piece of political expediency which owes
much of its construction to Labour's need for Scots MPs to help it win a
British General Election. We owe each other a friendly clean break and
the prospect of a constructive future as good neighbours.

COLIN CAMPBELL defines the Church of Scotland as ''a historic guardian
of Scotland's nationhood in contemporary Europe'' (November 13).
Even as a secular role for a church, I find this an utter
contradiction of the objectives Jesus set out for his disciples in the
gospels. I cannot imagine him telling them to go and preach the gospels
to all nations and found churches as historic guardians of their
nationhood.
The Church of Scotland is not alone, of course. As a Roman Catholic I
often wonder if I am a member of the spiritual wing of various
aggressive nationalist movements, not least here in Scotland.
Recent research, widely reported, has revealed a dramatic decline in
church membership. I believe this is because people are not finding the
gospel of the New Testament preached with sufficient rigour by the
churches.
As for Paris, Scotland's nationhood is well represented by various
Scottish institutions such as the Bank of Scotland, which dates from
before the Union, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
There is no shortage of churches in Paris to represent Jesus Christ,
if that is what Parisian Scots are looking for.

I READ with interest, not to say amazement, the letter from Councillor
Margaret Murray about declarations of interest (November 10).
I should have expected any elected councillor to be aware that local
authorities have a duty in law to keep a register of members' outside
interests and councillors have a legal obligation to declare such
interests.
Councillors' allowances are public knowledge and published in council
minutes.
Perhaps Councillor Murray should sign the declaration of interests
held by her own authority.

WHEN Lanarkshire lost a #450m Samsung investment to North-east England
last year, there were plenty of dark hints circulating locally about
foul play at the inward investment crossroads. Underhand land deals,
even fat sacks of additional Heseltine swag were allegedly used to deny
Scotland its prize and lure the Koreans to Cleveland instead. Now that
Lanarkshire has succeeded in winning the #260m Chunghwa picture tube
investment from Taiwan, and a promised 3300 full-time jobs when the
plant is fully operational, others grumble that, this time, the
incentive package promised by the Scottish Office -- thought to be
around #80m, one-third of the total -- is excessively generous.
Some of these critics, like the Irish, pushed rival locations and
packages but lost out in the hard-fought negotiations to land Chunghwa.
Now they hint that Scotland's offer breached the fair competition rules.
But Scotland has nothing to teach Dublin, with its 10-year moratorium on
corporation tax for selected incomers, about offering inward investors
some of the juiciest carrots in Europe. The fact that the Taiwanese
preferred Scotland on this occasion suggests that swag is not the only
incentive discriminating investors look for.
Other critics are right here in Scotland. Having tasted blood on the
HCI debacle, they question state aid on such a scale to win any mobile
capital project. But Scotland cannot have it both ways. If we are
serious about wooing overseas industrial investment we must accept that
it comes at a price to the public purse. If we don't want to pay the
price that actually lands projects, we should quit the game. But we've
played that game, with some considerable success, for most of the
post-war period. Thanks to earlier waves of inward investment, Scotland
is now a major source, within Europe, of semiconductors, personal
computers, automated banking machines, and workstations. The beauty of
this deal -- apart from the scale of the promised job generation -- is
that it roots the whole computer and consumer electronics sector more
credibly in Silicon Glen for the long term by plugging one of the
yawning gaps in the local supply chain and by opening up the prospect of
further upstream and downstream investment.
To make picture tubes you need glass and, although there is already a
joint German/Japanese supplier in Wales, there may, given Chunghwa's
target of 10 million tubes a year, be scope for further local investment
there. And, once the tubes are made here, there will be an incentive for
monitor manufacturers to assemble here too. Chunghwa already commands
one-third of the world market in colour monitors. Once established in
Mossend it will be a powerful magnet for others. The Scottish Office and
Locate in Scotland were right to pull out all the stops available to
them on this occasion. We congratulate all concerned for making it
happen.

US ECONOMY
Washington, Tuesday -- Retail sales weakened in October, except new
cars, in a sluggish run-up to the vital holiday sales season, the
Commerce Department said today.
Total retail sales fell 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted $197.16bn after
a revised 0.1% rise in September.
The drop would have been much sharper except for a rebound in October
new car sales. Excluding these, sales were down 0.5% last month after a
revised 0.8% September increase.
Sales at department stores fell sharply last month as did clothing
store receipts, adding to signs that shoppers are being cautious about
spending. That is not a hopeful sign for many businesses that count on a
surge in sales between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday.
''Clearly, the consumer is not a ball of fire here and will not push
the economy ahead in the fourth quarter at all,'' said John Williams,
managing director and chief global markets economist at Bankers Trust.
''There's a lot of weakness in the consumer sector of the economy as
we move into the fourth quarter of the year -- widespread weakness,''
said Matthew Alexy, chief markets economist at CS First Boston Corp.
During October, sales of new cars rose 0.7% after a 2% drop in
September. The figures include not only sales to individuals, but also
to fleet buyers such as car rental companies.
New cars account for about one-fifth of total retail sales, so swings
in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures.
Sales of all types of durable goods, items such as cars and furniture
that are intended to last three years or more, rose 0.2% last month
after a 1% drop in September.
But sales of non-durable items, from clothing to paper products, fell
0.5% after a 0.9% September increase.
Mr Williams said the economy seemed likely to continue to grow at a
very moderate pace, with some slowdown in consumer spending. ''That is
consistent with the Federal Reserve easing monetary policy probably at
the December (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting,'' he added.
Sales by department stores fell 0.8% in October following a 1.4%
increase in September. At clothing stores, sales dropped 2.4% after
rising 2.9% in September.
September retail sales previously were reported up 0.3%. But that was
revised downwards to a 0.1% gain. September sales excluding cars were
revised up to a 0.8% increase from a previously reported 0.7% rise. --

HOCKEY
AT THE Barcelona Olympics it was the three women's hockey players,
Wendy Fraser, Susan Fraser, and Alison Ramsay, who salvaged some pride
for the Scottish athletes by bringing home the only medals.
They helped Great Britain under Scottish coach Dennis Hay to the
bronze medals at the expense of Korea. But if they are to improve upon
that superb feat in Atlanta this summer, they must secure one of the
five places at stake in the Eight-Nation Round Robin qualifying
tournament which begins this afternoon in Cape Town.
Hay has passed over the reins to England's Sue Slocombe but the
Scottish influence in a playing sense is much stronger, with Susan
Fraser having been joined by Pauline Robertson, the team's vice-captain,
Susan MacDonald, Rhona Simpson, and Diane Renilson. This quintet of
highly experienced campaigners are great competitors.
Britain's strength may well prove to be the tartan strike force of
MacDonald and Fraser. But many observers are concerned because England,
the main contributors to the side, clearly are in decline. They finished
fourth in the European Nations Cup in June after dropping to a poor
tenth in the World Cup last year.
The opposition includes such distinguished teams as Argentina (World
Cup finalists), Germany (Olympic finalists), and Holland (European
champions), as well as the crack Asian sides Korea and China, hosts
South Africa, and Canada.
The Canadians, whom Britain play in their opening match tomorrow, may
well prove to be the weakest but it is not easy to identify which would
be the two other teams whom Britain must edge out.
Today's games are: Argentina v Holland, China v Germany, South Africa
v Korea.

RAIN, hail, sleet, snow, frost and fog are just some of the weather
extremes that come your way when driving throughout the winter months.
And when your car has recently experienced one of its best summers, with
temperatures rising above normal and with hardly any cooling rain, a
change in weather is enough to bring a shock to its system.
Faced with this new set of elements, especially after October's
rainfall when it nearly drowned, there is on the horizon an accumulation
of clouds bearing snow, rain and drizzle with few breaks for sunshine.
However, all is not lost, and by taking a number of sensible precautions
your vehicle will sail through the winter without a cough or a splutter
and more important, get you from A to B.
A pre-winter service is the best bet when tyres, battery, starter
motor, wiper blades and anti-freeze will all be checked and the vehicle
given a thorough inspection for potential trouble. A lighter-grade of
oil may be recommended to help with starting and the car's electrics
sealed to prevent dampness.
There is little doubt that the increase in wet weather brings
hazardous road conditions and the requirement to have tyres with a legal
tread and in good condition is imperative. It is also the season for
punctures. When a nail or screw lying on the road pierces a tyre, water
seems to lubricate the sharp ends and help penetration.
Winter driving certainly provides a mixture of weather and road
conditions. Tyres should be kept at the recommended pressure especially
through the winter when roads are icy, under-inflated tyres do not
perform as well. A winter service will always include a scrutiny of the
tyre, that part of the car which is between you and the road and which
may ultimately decide on the safety of yourself and your passengers in
the event of an emergency stop.
The distance a car takes to stop is radically affected by the tread
depth on a tyre. And although ice makes little difference to this rule,
on a wet road it is crucial, particularly at higher speeds. On a wet
road at 70mph a car whose tyres have 5mm of tread depth will stop in a
little more than half the distance it takes for a car whose tyres have a
tread depth of 1mm.
Damp roads such as those that occur with drizzly rain require much
more respect because they are likely to be enveloped in a greasy film
created by the mixture of dust, oil and water.
If you live in an area where flooding is common and you see water on
the road ahead only proceed if you are confident that the water will go
no higher than the bottom of the car's cooling-fan blade.
If you ignore flood water and choose to make a splash it could be to
your great cost. The resultant surge of water when the car enters the
water may swamp your engine and flood your car's electrics causing the
engine to stall. Water may then be sucked back through the car's exhaust
system into the engine's cylinders. Damage to pistons, con-rods and
crankshaft could result which may not be obvious until you have driven
some distance. In this case, making a splash would be an expensive
lesson.
Undoubtedly one of the biggest let-downs in the winter is when the
car's battery fails. Cold temperatures reduce the capacity of any
battery and if it is more than three years old it is worthwhile having
it checked.

Catriona Stevens reports on the success of Britain's oldest
co-educational boarding school
A PIONEER module in law, Japanese for busy people, and cooking in a
bedsit are just some of the choices for sixth-year students at Dollar
Academy. An open-minded approach to learning has always characterised
the independent school in the foothills of the Ochils. Its senior
pupils, of course, combine these novelties with more conventional
sixth-year studies, A levels, or extra Highers.
Dollar Academy has been co-educating young Scots and others for 177
years. It can claim, among other distinctions, to be the oldest
co-educational boarding school in Britain. Its student roll has always
had an international dimension, from princes of the Ethiopian royal
house to children of the railway builders and teaplanters of India.
Today's boarders include young Scots and English; a European
contingent, mainly from Germany and France; and youngsters from the US,
Canada, and South America, the Gulf, and Hong Kong. The boarders account
for some 150 of the total roll of 1100. This mix of local and
international children gives a cosmopolitan flavour to Dollar life.
The boarders live in pleasant stone-built houses -- three for girls,
three for boys -- surrounded by gardens. The boarding atmosphere is
civilised and uninstitutional. The school had a ''marvellous pilot
inspection'' by HMI last year, points out the rector, John Robertson. He
was Dollar's deputy rector for seven years before his appointment to the
top post last year.
Academic excellence is seen as the bedrock on which the school's other
assets are cultivated. Some 90% of Dollar's pupils go on to take degrees
in Scotland, elsewhere in Britain, and increasingly abroad. The school
also encourages children to take a year out, to work in the Third World,
go on scholarships to the US, or develop their language skills in
Europe.
The Academy is in expansionist mode these days. Last week Lord Younger
opened its latest building. This houses eight mathematics classrooms and
the business studies and computer departments. The former Cabinet
Minister apparently took a great interest in computer programmes running
the British economy.
The arts are strongly cultivated at the school. The art department's
annual exhibitions are always an impressive display of creativity.
Paintings spill out into corridors and stairways. Ned Kelly peers from a
mural by an Australian girl on the way to the rector's study.
There are two school orchestras as well as several choirs. In 1997
Dollar's young musicians are going on a South American tour, taking in
Argentina and Chile. Each year ambitious ''musical'' and drama
productions are also mounted.
The admonition over the bronze doorway of the Playfair building to:
''Apply yourself diligently to learning and strenuously to games, so
upholding and enhancing the honour of your school'' may be
old-fashioned, but Dollar has always had, in parallel with its academic
preoccupations, a strong interest in sports.
The Academy is a formidable force in Scottish school rugby, where its
white-clad players (''the silent white machine'') can cast ''a daur''
over opponents. It also is the only Scottish school invited to take part
in the annual St Joseph's schools rugby tournament in Ipswich, the
premier event of its kind. Three Dollar players took part in the
Scottish schoolboy trials last week and right wing Stewart Walker (who
is also head boy) was chosen for the team. No fewer than seven Dollar
boys are in the Midlands Schools' under-18 XV.
The main rugby pitches lie to the west of the school in the lee of the
Ochils. Hockey is played in the green acres in front of the main
building, as is junior cricket in the summer term.
Some 200 boys and girls are in the combined cadet force, though there
is no compulsion to join. It enjoys strong links with the Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders.
So is there a typical Dollar pupil? Probably not, since individuality
and diversity are so highly respected. However, perhaps a common ideal
would be of modest self-confidence, courtesy, and responsibility. And,
says Mr Robertson, ''Dollar children are very open and encouraged to
communicate.''
* Dollar fees for the senior school are #4149 per annum for day
pupils, #9195 for boarders, and #8715 for weekly boarders.

READING the comments about the Skye Bridge which should be toll-free
in 20 years when the debt is paid off, I wonder who will be responsible
for the cost of repairs to the bridge over this period.
If you take for example the Tay and Kingston bridges when they
approached 20 years old the repairs cost more than the original cost of
building them. If the Skye Bridge needs expensive repairs in the next 20
years will this mean the toll will continue for 40 or 50 years?

THE Labour MP for Cunninghame North makes a very ''cue-rious'' case in
his column, ''three blues you would never tire of potting'', and appears
to have played himself into a tight corner (November 10).
While Brian Wilson has been busy trying to pot red balls, it has
obviously escaped his notice that Stirling District Council has been
Conservative-controlled and run since 1992 -- not Labour-controlled as
he imagined. In fact, it has been so efficiently controlled that we will
be leaving the new unitary council with more money than it anticipated.
In this case, Mr Wilson has fouled his shot leaving his whole argument
snookered. Chalk this one up to the Conservatives.

TORY plans to create a marketplace for nursery education have been
widely rejected in Scotland, a local government research body has found.
According to the Scottish Local Government Information Unit, Scots do
not want parents to be issued with vouchers worth #1100 for the purchase
of nursery and other pre-school places for their three or
four-year-olds.
They want local authorities to be properly funded to provide
pre-schooling for all who want it, the unit has concluded after
analysing responses to the Government's consultation on the voucher
scheme.
There were about 140 replies from individuals, local authorities,
playgroups, childminders, trade unions, schools, and private nurseries.
More than 80% were opposed to vouchers, with only 23 -- representing
about 16% of the total -- supporting the scheme.
Only seven of the 29 single-tier councils have expressed an interest
in taking part in pilot schemes which are due to begin in August next
year ahead of full implementation.
But even they have expressed serious concerns about the running of a
voucher scheme, said the unit.
Ministers have said that an #1100 voucher would buy a part-time place
in a nursery or pay for a full-time place in a playgroup.
They envisage parents being able to use the voucher value to top up
the cost of a full-time place in the private or voluntary sectors, but
have said that local authorities -- which are responsible for the vast
majority of provision -- would not be able to charge more than #1100.
The unit has found, however, that few respondents believe that
vouchers will provide pre-five education which is high-quality, fair,
and consistent.
The voucher value was widely criticised for failing to take account of
the additional costs for children in rural areas and those with special
needs.
A business services company has won the contract to operate the pilot
throughout Britain, but many respondents said administration of the full
scheme would be bureaucratic and costly, estimated at #2m in Scotland.
There was also widespread concern, said the unit, about vouchers being
socially divisive, since more affluent parents would be able to use them
to top up the cost of nursery education, an option closed to low-income
households, particularly as local authorities would be unable to levy
additional charges to extend their provision.
There will be no additional capital expenditure for local authorities
to provide more places, with the consultation paper suggesting instead
that surplus school places could meet increased demand.
But many local authorites had highlighted the cost of adapting
buildings for nursery use. Strathclyde region's estimate was #20,000 for
each primary classroom.
The majority of responses agreed that vouchers would harm local
authority provision, a consensus which was particularly telling because
public support for council nurseries was high.
A Scottish Parent Teacher Council survey found that 77% of respondents
favoured a form of local authority nursery schooling as their ideal
choice.
Of those parents whose children had experienced local authority
nurseries, more than 85% were satisfied with provision.
The final form of the Scottish pilot scheme and the authorities which
will take part in it are still to be announced, but the unit concluded:
''It appears that the Government wants to proceed with implementing a
scheme for which there is little support.''
Councillor Jean McFadden, convener of the unit and the new Glasgow
City Council, said the survey confirmed widespread rejection of the
scheme.
''It underlines the fundamental objection, on a matter of principle,
to the use of vouchers to 'pay' for nursery education, in effect
bringing the notions of competition and the marketplace into pre-five
provision in Scotland.''
The Minister for Scottish education, Mr Raymond Robertson, said last
night: ''The Prime Minister announced in July that there would be a
voucher initiative to deliver his commitment to provide a place in the
pre-school year for every child whose parents wished it.
''Our consultation document invited comments on how such a voucher
system might operate in Scotland. We are now taking it forward.''

A SCOTTISH university is to head a new European project to develop a
home-shopping experience in which customers will get advice on purchases
and place their orders with an on-screen ''3-D'' shop assistant.
Edinburgh University's Centre for Communication Interface Research is
to lead the three-year #3.75m research programme to be funded under the
European Commission's advanced communications programme.
Researchers will work with teams in France and Italy as well as with
counterparts employed by Great Universal Stores, the shopping group.
Together they will develop and trial a 3-D face with which the
customer can converse and discuss their shopping needs.
''This personal assistant will be able to give advice, select items
requested and will even remember the customer on their next 'visit'.
''Added to this the assistant will remember details such as what
you've bought before, sizes you take, favourite colours or any other
pertinent details you've chosen to divulge,'' said a spokesman at the
university.
Professor Mervyn Jack, the director of the centre, said yesterday
that, using virtual reality and multimedia technologies, the Edinburgh
team would simulate the ''touch and feel'' of today's shopping
experience, replacing it with virtual reality versions of goods.
The new service will be tried out in several sites throughout Europe
to judge public acceptance of the experience.

Bucharest
TENS of thousands of Romanians packed central Bucharest today to mourn
opposition leader and former political prisoner Corneliu Coposu, whose
fight against communism broke his health but never won him power.
The crowd filled Revolution Square, scene of some of the worst
fighting in the 1989 anti-communist revolution and where executed
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu gave his last speech.
Mourners filled the balconies around the old Communist Party central
committee building and the former royal palace, to bid farewell to
Coposu, who died last Saturday aged 79.
''Adio, domnule Coposu (Goodbye lord Coposu),'' read a huge headline
above Coposu's portrait in Evenimentul Zilei newspaper.
Coposu survived the challenges of 20th century Romania, which moved
from pre-war monarchism and bourgeois prosperity to grinding oppression
and impoverishment under communism.
He spent 17 years as a political prisoner for his liberal democratic
beliefs, eight in solitary confinement, and emerged in 1964 unable to
talk. His Swiss-born wife died in jail.
With exiled king Michael, Coposu was one of few figures to excite
respect and love in a country where the ruling party, now democratically
elected, is dominated by former communists.
Coposu's National Peasant Party (PNTCD) and its allies in the
Democratic Convention have failed to overcome the power of the Party of
Social Democracy and President Ion Iliescu, in power since Ceausescu was
executed at Christmas in 1989.
His death after years of heart and lung problems, leaves a leadership
vacuum in the opposition a year ahead of elections.
Coposu's aluminium casket, draped in a pre-war Romanian tricolor with
the royal crest still in place, was carried down Bucharest's main
boulevard by fellow politicians escorted by leading churchmen of all
denominations.
A huge crowd followed carrying a block-long fabric cross with hundreds
of flowers and wreaths. Police chiefs put the Revolution Square crowd at
70,000, others said many more.
Ex-king Michael, who says the government prevented him returning from
Switzerland for the funeral, had a message broadcast to the crowd --
some of whom carried his portrait.
''Romanians know how much Corneliu Coposu wanted us to be able to
return to the country for its good, as much as I have wanted to join
those making the last homage,'' Michael said.
His wife, Queen Ana, and daughter Princess Margareta, who are allowed
to enter Romania, were among the mourners.--Reuter.

Washington
THE US secretary of state, Warren Christopher, is spending the day at
the Bosnia peace talks in Ohio, in hopes of pointing the participants
towards a settlement. The sticking points remaining are the borders of
the Serb and Muslim/Croat zones and the fate of Sarajevo.
The question of war criminals has also to be resolved but the
territorial dispute is the most difficult.
Mr Christopher has supervised the discussions, now in their third
week, from afar. They have made considerable progress on two fronts, in
settling the question of Eastern Slavonia, an area of Croatia captured
by Serbs in 1991, and setting up a genuine federation between Bosnian
Croats and Muslims.
Both these settlements have to be put into effect, of course, but
reaching them was a considerable achievement. However, the territorial
dispute between the Serbs and the rest must be resolved or the whole
conference will collapse.
The two sides remain absolutely obdurate, and Mr Christopher will try
to persuade the three presidents to compromise. The Serbs, represented
by Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, want to recover some of the
territory lost in their enemies' summer offensive, notably the town of
Sanski Most in western Bosnia. They also want to enlarge the corridor,
now six miles wide, linking their possessions in eastern and in western
Bosnia, and they also lay claim to Goradze.
The Muslims refuse to give up Sanski Most, let alone Goradze, and want
to close the corridor.
As for Sarajevo, the government, wants it to be a united city. The
Serbs, who control roughly a third of it and most of the suburbs, want
it divided, like Berlin before 1989, by a permanent frontier.
Mr Christopher has only a day to push the negotiations forward. Then
he is flying to a Pacific Rim conference in Tokyo.
The state department said that the Dayton talks have not yet reached
the make or break stage, but admits that they have come to the most
difficult issues.

Geneva
JEWELS of the Aga Khan's divorced wife have fetched nearly $28m,
astonishing some experts, in a sale that Christie's auction house hailed
today as a triumph.
The gems, subject of a pre-sale legal wrangle, went for almost twice
their estimated price from worldwide buyers.
Auction officials and the official catalogue indicated Princess
Salimah Aga Khan would devote some of the proceeds to charity.
The sale, held in a packed salon of a luxury Geneva hotel late
yesterday, was only cleared at the last minute after she won a two-week
court battle with her ex-husband over her rights to the sumptuous
collection.
''This sale was a triumph,'' a statement from Christie's director and
auctioneer Francois Curiel said.
Christie's said of the 238 lots on auction, 210 ''comfortably exceeded
their estimates'', and they were all sold for a total of 31.2m Swiss
francs ($27.68m), commission paid by the buyer included.
The couple, who have three children, were divorced in March after
nearly 25 years of marriage. The Aga Khan, head of the Ismaili Moslem
community and one of the world's richest men, argued the princess had no
right to sell them.
A Geneva court, after initially granting him an injunction, finally
ruled last Friday that the sale could go ahead.
The star item in the sale was the ''Beghum Blue'', a 13.78 carat
heart-shaped deep blue diamond at the centrepiece of a diamond necklace
designed by Paris jewellers Poiray, which had been estimated at $7m.

Frankfurt
TRADER Mr Nick Leeson is likely to be put on a plane for Singapore
next week following final approval for his extradition, a German public
prosecutor said today.
Leeson is expected to be handed over to officials from Singapore at
Frankfurt airport, where he was arrested more than eight months ago in
the wake of the #860m crash of Barings Bank, said Mr Gernot Brochat.
The 28-year-old, who faces trial on 11 charges of fraud and forgery,
was visited today at Hoechst prison in the city suburbs by his lawyer,
Mr Stephen Pollard.
''This is just a routine meeting,'' said Mr Pollard's secretary,
adding that he would be making no statement on the extradition.
Mr Leeson gave up his fight against extradition two weeks ago after
Singapore's official report on the crash found that he was not solely to
blame and that his superiors tried to cover up his losses.
The charges he faces carry a maximum 14-year sentence, but there has
been speculation that he may have arranged a plea bargain which would
let him off with a sentence as low as 12 months.
Mr Leeson's extradition was approved by the Bonn government with no
conditions attached, said a spokesman for the Justice Ministry.
He said the authorities in Singapore had promised to ask the court to
take into account in any sentence the time the trader had spent in jail
awaiting extradition.
The Frankfurt public prosecutor's office is responsible for making the
final arrangements to hand Mr Leeson over to officials of Singapore's
Commercial Affairs Department -- the equivalent of Britain's Serious
Fraud Office.
''We are now beginning the process of informing Singapore of the
decision and to determine when their authorities will be coming to
Frankfurt to pick up Mr Leeson,'' said Mr Brochat.
Frankfurt prosecutor Hans-Hermann Eckert, who has been responsible for
Mr Leeson's extradition case, has previously said a delay of a week is
normal between finalising details of a handover and carrying it out.
At the request of his lawyers, the handover will only be announced
after he is on the way to Singapore for fear that he would otherwise be
hounded by reporters and television crews on the long flight.
Mr Leeson is likely to be brought to court to be charged within 48
hours .--Reuter.

Western defence officials and diplomats in Kuwait said today they were

Officials and businessmen said they would alter routes to work, vary
office hours, tighten security drills and keep a lower profile to guard
against any similar attack in the Gulf state which a Western-led force
freed from Iraqi troops in 1991.
''I went out of my way today to take a different route to work and I
arrived in the office at a different time. I'll be doing that from now
on,'' one American said.
''We are taking steps, but nothing overt,'' said one defence executive
managing a large supply and training contract.

Washington
A BOMB that exploded beside a military building in the Saudi Arabian
capital of Riyadh yesterday killing seven people weighed between 150 and
225 pounds, the Pentagon said today.
US Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon said also a team of 19 FBI
agents and two State Department security experts had arrived in the
kingdom to help investigate the blast, which killed five Americans and
injured 37 others.
Bacon said he was not aware of any suspects under arrest in the bomb
blast, which Saudi Arabia has said also killed a Filipino and an Indian.
Two groups have claimed responsibility for the attack.
''The size of the bomb was between 150 and 225 pounds of high
explosive. But I don't know what type of explosive,'' Bacon told
reporters at a briefing.
''We think it was in a van. That is our best information now.''
He said the US military's Central Command, which is based in Tampa and
is responsible for American forces in the Gulf, had ordered an increase
in security at all US military facilities in the region.
The bombed building was a Saudi National Guard facility and was used
by American military and civilian personnel to train Saudis in the use
of weapons purchased from Washington.
Bacon said six of the 37 injured Americans remained in critical
condition today and 20 of the injured had been treated and released from
hospitals.
The Pentagon identified the US soldier killed in the blast as Sgt.
David Warrell, 34. It also identified one of four American civilians
killed as William Combs, 54, who was working for the US Army in Saudi
Arabia.
Another of the four civilians was identified yesterday as Wayne
Wilkey, 55.
Bacon said the majority of those killed or injured were Americans
because the blast ripped into a snack bar at the lunch hour while they
were eating.
''There were no known Saudi fatalities in the explosion. The principal
reason for that was that the blast took place during midday prayers,''
he said.--Reuter.

Massachusetts
A MAN shot his live-in girlfriend's four children in the head in
Lowell, Massachusetts, killing one, after she asked him to move out
because the children didn't like him, authorities said today.
A 12-year-old boy died, and two others were in critical condition. One
was also slashed in the neck with a machete.
Vuthy Seng, 34, was arrested at a friend's house about three hours
after the evening attack.
''She tried to tell him to get out of the apartment because the kids
didn't like him and she doesn't like him,'' said Chuop Ream, the
children's aunt. She said Seng and the childrens' mother, Chong Yim, had
been living together for about two months.
Ream said her sister had moved to Lowell, Massachusetts from Cambodia
eight years ago. About one quarter of the city's 105,000 residents are
Cambodian, Laotian or Vietnamese.
Seng pleaded innocent to four counts each of armed assault with intent
to commit murder and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and
one count of possession of a firearm. District Court Judge Neil Walker
ordered him held without bail.--AP

ACTING Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres awaited the official
go-ahead on Wednesday to form a new government which he said would be
prepared to pay a painful price for peace.
Winding up consultations with Israeli political parties, President
Ezer Weizman was widely expected to ask Peres at a meeting later in the
day to put together an administration in the aftermath of the killing of
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
''We took an unprecedented step and told the president that in light
of the tremendous tragedy, we request he give the representative of the
Labour party (Peres) a mandate to form the government,'' said Benjamin
Netanyahu, leader of the main right-wing opposition party, the Likud.
Religious factions also said Peres was their choice, following the
November 4 assassination of Rabin by a young religious Jew.
In an interview with Israel's Channel Two television late yesterday,
Peres reaffirmed his commitment to Rabin's peace policy with the
Palestinians and hinted he would be prepared for significant concessions
on withdrawal from the Golan Heights.--Reuter.

<RECORDNO>975372529</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SALES made by the Caledonian Cheese Company, which was established
earlier this year, have exceeded expectations to such an extent that it
is now short of milk.
Its major supplier, Scottish Milk, is unable to supply the creamery
with enough to meet its needs and it is now looking to secure milk
direct from farmers.
Douglas Irvine, director of the Caledonian Cheese Company, said: ''We
are strong supporters of Scottish Milk, but we are disappointed that it
cannot supply our needs, despite the fact the creamery is located in
Scotland's richest and largest milk field.
''Almost two-thirds of the local milk field ends up in England, Wales
and Ireland, and this means that we have to bring in milk from outside.
This is inefficient and wasteful and we believe that we offer a more
viable and efficient long-term alternative.
''As we move towards the next century, we are looking to a brighter
and more secure future. To this end, we need more Scottish-produced milk
to manufacture quality Scottish dairy products.
''Because Scottish Milk cannot supply enough milk for our needs, we
now believe its time to talk to farmers and to secure milk supplies
direct from them. With the efficiencies of purchasing direct, we are now
in a position to offer more money for milk and we are expecting a strong
response from farmers.''
The creamery, under new ownership, is a market-led company which has a
growing demand for its products such as the best-selling Galloway
Scottish Cheddar and McLelland Mature brands. Its long-term strategy is
to keep expanding production and introducing new lines.

Beaters engaged for the day should be paid in cash at the end of the

<HEADLINE>Beef 2000 considers BSE and consumer confidence. Industry urged not to dismiss public fears</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>26</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975372531</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE farming industry must learn to handle consumer concerns on issues
such as animal health and welfare with great care, Professor Sir Colin
Spedding, former director of Reading University's Centre for
Agricultural Strategy, said yesterday.
Speaking on the day after a World In Action television programme
raised further concerns about BSE -- the so-called mad cow disease -- he
warned against appearing to dismiss public concerns out of hand.
''In terms of farm and animal welfare the citizen is entitled to be
concerned and these matters cannot be dismissed just because they are
based on ignorance,'' he told the Beef 2000 conference at Inverurie.
''If you do dismiss such concerns you will never be trusted at all. We
are all ignorant on most topics. You have to take these concerns
seriously but not fall into the trap of assuming that you have to do
what your critics say.''
Sir Colin pointed out that not all criticism would be fair. Pictures
shown on television to back animal rights issues might not be from UK
slaughterhouses but they would still have an effect on the viewer.
''It is a sad thing that democracy doesn't seem to have arrived at a
satisfactory way of taking account of the views of the moderates,'' he
said. ''Most of the major advances in society have been brought about by
the actions of extremists. This is a very important problem we have to
confront -- we really need to listen to the moderates.
''If we ignore the moderates we create extremists and that is the
worst thing you can do.'' In terms of the livestock industry it was a
bit late -- they were already on the defensive, he said. ''There is
justification for farmers feeling they are being picked on but it is a
great mistake to react defensively. You could destroy whatever remaining
trust the consumer may have.''
The major retailing groups were beginning to impose their own farm
animal welfare standards and they had the power to do so on an
international level, which was more than governments could achieve, Sir
Colin said. Once they set their standards the big retailers had the
power to make it stick, which could be a threat to the livelihood of
individual producers who were unable to match them.
''The industry needs to think again about how it could get back into
the driving seat. It has to listen carefully to consumers and consider
how best to reassure them.''
BSE was, he said, a difficult issue but it had to be acknowledged that
many people, including those in the organic movement, believed it was
wrong to feed parts of other animals to ruminants. ''We should have
thought of that more carefully in the industry at the outset.''
Stuart Ashworth, a senior economist with the Scottish Agricultural
College at Auchincruive, suggested beef producers had to be prepared to
pay higher Meat and Livestock Commission levies to promote beef sales.
''Who is responsible for promoting your product?'' he asked the audience
of farmers from all over Scotland at the Thainstone Mart.
''Is it the wholesaler, retailer, processor or you?'' The producer, he
argued, had to face up to the prospect of higher levies.
That prospect is likely to become reality before the end of the year
when the MLC is expected to approve plans for increases above the rate
of inflation. It hopes to see such a policy continued for some years to
finance increased promotional effort.
The current marketing and promotion budget is #33m, paid for from
levies. Alastair Donaldson, MLC officer for Scotland, said that at point
of sale the meat industry was worth #11bn. The #33m promotion budget for
meat compared with #66m spent by Kelloggs advertising cornflakes on
television alone.
On BSE, he said, they were trying to counter the effects of some
sensational reporting. Nevertheless, the commission had to try to
respond with arguments on a sound scientific basis. ''We have to show
consumers that there are safety measures in place,'' he said.
Despite some serious adverse publicity one survey showed the number of
consumers giving up beef stood at 4%. That suggested a pretty resilient
position, he claimed.
Yesterday's conference was organised by the Royal Northern
Agricultural Society as part of its 150th anniversary celebrations.

GEEST, Britain's leading banana importer, warned yesterday that a
renewed slump in banana prices in the past two months meant its 1995
operating profits were likely to be well below market forecasts, writes
NICOLA REEVES.
The profit warning led the shares to slip 32p to 107p, after hitting a
low of 100p earlier.
The City was taken aback by the news. At the time of the interim
announcement in September, the company said it believed banana prices
would retain some firmness for the remainder of the final quarter of the
year.
Following the profit warning, some analysts believe Geest may make a
loss for the year compared with previous expectations for a #15m profit.
Substantial over-supply in northern Europe is apparantly to blame.
This is partly due to delayed shipments of Caribbean bananas following
September's storms. As a result the price last month was 30% below the
level seen during the same period last year. The final profit outcome is
said to depend on the typically volatile trading conditions during
November and December.
The company said it now had in hand a number of projects to improve
profit which would result in a #7m exceptional charge in the second
half. There was an exceptional charge of just over #5m in the first.
In recent years Geest has tried to reduce its dependence on bananas by
developing its chilled food interests. These are said to be continuing
to perform well.
Despite the problems in its banana business, the board intends to
maintain the level of the dividend for the year. It has already said it
will pay an interim dividend of 3.7p next month. Last year, there was a
final of 4.4p. However, this is dependent on the final outcome of 1995
earnings and the company's future prospects.

GENERAL Accident's #170m acquisition of Provident Mutual has not sated
its appetite for more purchases in the life field. Deputy chief
executive Barrie Holder commented yesterday that it would look at other
acquisitions which would add overall value.
More opportunities are likely to present themselves given the
consolidation widely expected within the industry. Smaller firms will
find it difficult to finance regulatory and marketing costs at a time
when competition will be hotting up.
Larger predatory companies could achieve good economies of scale by
absorbing their smaller brethren and acquisition costs should be
reasonable given the pressures the latter are under.
However, integrating life companies can be a difficult process and
General Accident will no doubt be encouraged to look for more purchases
if Provident Mutual is absorbed easily.
Certainly it is keen to expand in life and pensions and rightly so
given the long-term growth potential of the market as the state
withdraws further from these areas. With its balance sheet boosted by
higher investment returns, General Accident has the resources to expand
through acquisition.
Elsewhere, the group is confident there will not be a general slide in
rates so long as the industry keeps its cool and remains disciplined.
This has been the problem in the past. A profitable period has led to
more capacity coming into the market and companies slashing premiums to
gain market share.
This time round it has not happened and companies have refrained from
aggressive price-cutting. They have been prepared to sacrifice market
share rather than see underwriting losses.
The jury is still out on whether a burst of price-cutting will break
out again but, with the highwater mark of the direct insurers probably
past, the omens look good.
One in the eye
ROLLS-Royce has delivered one in the eye for its doubters by winning a
#1200m order for its Trent engine to power Boeing 777s for Singapore
Airlines (SIA).
The order is a breakthrough for the group in its head-to-head battle
with its US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, part of the
United Technologies conglomerate. SIA has used Pratt &amp; Whitney for 20
years and its decision to break its loyalty shows how highly it thinks
of the Trent. It is one of the most successful airlines and its example
is likely to be followed by others.
It is reckoned there will be a market for more than 1000 twin-engined
long-range wide-bodied aircraft like the 777 and its Airbus rivals the
A330 and A340. Rolls has secured orders for engines for about 300
aircraft so has some 30% of the market, a very respectable share.
Several analysts have issued sell notes on Rolls lately on the grounds
that its overall market share was down to 20% and falling. It is the
smallest of the big three and has always suffered from the argument that
it is just not big enough to stay up there with the US companies who
have the resources of huge parents behind them.
But as far as large engines are concerned, it has shown it can compete
technically and the Trent will keep it up with the leaders for many
years to come. Rolls needs a long production run if it is to make money
on the Trent and it has now secured this. The market will remain highly
competitive but this prospect will help sustain the shares despite their
relatively high rating.
LIFFE merger
BUSINESSES whatever their trade are increasingly of the view that to
compete effectively in the global market, bigger is best.
That is the rationale behind the merger of two of London's specialist
financial markets, the London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (LIFFE) and the London Commodity Exchange (LCE).
As a result of the merger the LCE, whose main contracts are cocoa,
coffee and sugar, will become a division of LIFFE. In July, the two
exchanges started discussions on the possibility of a strategic
partnership.
The New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange had been eyeing up the
LCE and it was also in merger discussions with the International
Petroleum Exchange based in London.
In addition, the LCE is exploring the possibility of a joint venture
with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) to trade CBOT agricultural
contracts in London. LIFFE already shares contracts with the CBOT.
In recent years, in common with other businesses, there has been
mounting pressure to cut overhead costs and introduce innovative new
products. LIFFE has had a very successful history in its own right,
managing to beat off competition from similar markets in Paris and
Frankfurt.
On LIFFE, investors can deal on one market in products denominated in
seven of the world's major currencies. These include UK, German, Italian
and Japanese government bonds and sterling, US dollar, ECU, Deutschmark,
Swiss franc and Lira short-term interest rates.
It also has an active product development programme. For example, in
1989 it launched its APT automated trading system for out-of-hours
trading and has an ongoing programme of developing new contracts in
accordance with market needs.
While it remains very much committed to its trading floor, with
traders wearing brightly coloured jackets and using arcane hand signals,
LIFFE's vision of the future is to have a fully-integrated, order-driven
automated market in which users are able to trade both cash and equity
derivatives through a single screen.
It is such a vision which will enable London to maintain its position
as one of the three major financial centres, along with New York and
Tokyo. Since its inception in 1982, LIFFE has become a leading global
institution making a significant contribution to the British economy.
During 1994, it contributed #700m to the invisible account of the
balance of payments and its activities have created thousands of jobs in
the City of London.

Murray Ritchie, European Editor, reports from Strasbourg on badly
timed comments from the Paymaster General on abuses of EU funds.
MUCH political humbug is generated by the debate on European Union
fraud. It surfaced again yesterday with comments by Paymaster General
David Heathcoat-Amory, that Britain was leading the fight against misuse
of community funds.
This is true, but it is not the whole truth. The fact is that Britain
emerged yesterday as one of the member states seen to be most guilty of
the misuse of, or failure to account for, EU funds.
The point was underlined when the EU's Court of Auditors singled out
Britain, Denmark, and Spain as culprits in the loss or failure to
account for EU spending.
In Britain it seems to be the same story as elsewhere in the EU. Money
vanishes in circumstances which might not amount to blatant fraud --
though no doubt some does exactly that -- but it is not accounted for to
the satisfaction of the Brussels monitors. In the absence of evidence to
the contrary we can assume at least some of it has been misappropriated
-- yet ministers would have us believe that dishonesty begins at Calais.
It really was a bit rich for Mr Heathcoat-Amory to proclaim Britain's
sword-and-shield virtue at a time when the European Commission is busy
investigating the suspected systematic abuse of EU structural funding by
the illegal use of aid in fattening public utilities for privatisation.
Douglas Hurd in his days as a distinguished Foreign Secretary started
the fraud debate. When the Tories began tearing themselves apart after
the General Election Mr Hurd, ever the minister with the first-aid box,
chose fraud as a subject fit for a British initiative, one which would
show the UK fighting at the heart of Europe on the side of the angels.
Politically, it was not a bad idea even if to some noses it was
redolent of opportunism. Fraud in the EU is a problem, always has been,
and it has its roots deep in the culture of the European agricultural
sector which survived -- even thrived -- on subsidies.
In the beginning this policy was based on decency and a genuine
international determination that Europeans would never again starve. The
money from post-war industry -- mostly German -- would be sunk in
farming -- mostly French -- so that the social strains which led to war
would never reappear.
Farming became the biggest uneconomic pit in Europe and still is. As
other industries have been devastated -- Scotland's suffering is a prime
example -- farming continued to receive special treatment. Only now are
efforts being made to cap the vast sums poured into agriculture as the
reality of what EU enlargement eastwards will cost begins to dawn.
Subsidies from Brussels have become so huge and so easy to obtain --
for noble reasons -- that abuse has become an almost cottage industry.
Governments have connived in this abuse, perhaps not in a flagrant way,
but by lethargy or incompetence.
The Irish are good bad examples. They were referred to recently (by
one of their own) as the pickpockets of Europe because of their
phenomenal skill in prising money out of Brussels. Ireland's Government
has lately been accused of aiding and abetting losses through
malpractice by deliberately cooking the books to make the country look
poorer in order to raise support payments from the EU.
Britain does the same. Witness the struggle the Highlands and Islands
had with Merseyside to persuade Brussels they really were poor enough to
stand alongside Sicily in the queue for Objective 1 funding. In a sense
this is just playing the system, but so is abandoning national control
of the huge sums flowing from Europe into the United Kingdom, and
Britain is now seen to be guilty of that more serious laxness.
EU fraud has a long and dishonourable history and comes in many forms
-- mostly farm-related -- from Irish farmers playing tape recordings of
lowing cattle in empty floats crossing the Northern Ireland border, to
Spaniards fiddling tomato subsidies, to Greeks inventing olive groves,
to Scottish lairds showing ingenuity in relieving Brussels of cash in
dubious circumstances.
The fact is that for every #1 spent by the European Union, 80p is the
responsibility of the member states. The rest is spent in Brussels or
the other EU institutional centres which usually attract the bad
publicity, quite deservedly, when things go bad. But the cost of mislaid
or stolen furniture and overspending on Peps' offices and the other
familiar complaints are in fact a drop in the fraud bucket.
As the EU budget increases annually, so fraud is beginning to
decrease. This time last year there was talk of EU fraud costing perhaps
a fifth of the budget, if money correctly spent but inadequately
accounted for was taken into consideration. This year it is reported
that the total loss from fraud is down to perhaps 1% and the rest -- the
rumoured #2000m -- accounts for perhaps 4%.
With such astronomical sums it is tempting to conclude that the exact
level of fraud will never be known. We just know it to be too high. But
it would help if EU governments, those most guilty of parties, cut the
rhetoric and helped protect more of our money.
''Ministers would have us believe that dishonesty begins at Calais.''

MARY, Mary quite contrary Whitehouse is at it again. She has written
to the Independent Television Commission asking that the F-words used in
the hit comedy, Four Weddings and a Funeral, which Channel 4 is to
televise tonight be removed. She has not, however, sought to have the
film banned. Even she knows that to try to deprive the British
television public of a chance to see the most successful British film
ever would make her a laughing stock.
Channel 4 has pointed out that the film goes out after the 9pm
watershed and it considers the language used to be ''editorially
justified in the context of the film''.
As for the ITC, it will wait and see if there are any complaints
before acting. Are there grounds for complaint? The film, which stars
Hugh Grant, is an innocuous comedy set against the background, as the
title makes clear, of four society weddings and the funeral of one of
the regular attenders at the weddings. It is, in many ways, merely an
extended TV sitcom, but it does, to be fair, have a moral message of
sorts.
Grant plays a bachelor who refuses to commit himself to a relationship
with any of the women in his life. During the course of the weddings,
but particularly during the funeral, he realises the importance of a
relationship and the film ends with him making a commitment to one of
the women in his life.
The F-word is the first word in the film. It is uttered by Grant, and
used by him thereafter several times in rapid succession. He has
realised he is going to be late for a wedding and is exasperated. It is
not used, as it often is in Hollywood films, linked to other words or
with a sexual connotation. Nor is the language in the film blasphemous.
If it were there would be grounds for accepting that offence would be
given to people with religious beliefs. But it comes down to good taste.
The F-word is used, as it is by many people in everyday life, simply
as a curse word, an extreme way of saying ''bother'' or ''blast''. Why
not use such words? Someone like Grant would use the F-word in life so
why not in the film?
The question is whether Mrs Whitehouse has genuine grounds for
complaint. She has some reason for concern. The film has been extremely
popular, Grant is a teenybopper idol, and children not yet in their
teens will want to see it. The 9pm watershed will not deter them. But do
we need this sort of nannying?
Surely it is a question of parental responsibility. The trouble is
that if a glamorous figure like Grant uses the F-word it could seem to
many children there is no reason why they should not do so too. But then
many of them probably do so already. Mrs Whitehouse might find a visit
to any school playground salutary.
It is for parents to indicate such language is not acceptable in their
home, and in society generally. They may not stop their children using
it, but they may stop them from using it in their presence -- or within
hearing of sensitive souls like Mrs Whitehouse. As for bleeping the word
out, that merely lends mystery to its use. Any child interested in
learning what had been obliterated would easily do so.
Language, oddly, seems to upset people more than do scenes of explicit
sex or violence. It is interesting to note from the annual report of the
British Board of Film Classification, published yesterday, that no
complaints were received about the content of Quentin Tarentino's
Reservoir Dogs, released after some three years on the shelf, on video
this summer. The public response tends to suggest that the protests are
often media contrived.
But language is different. There are words men do not like used in
front of their womenfolk, although women are known to use them happily
when men are not there; words women feel embarrassed hearing when men
are present; and words parents think their children should not know, and
should not use until they are of an age.
In a way Mrs Whitehouse is taking a sledgehammer to a nut, because
Four Weddings is a totally harmless film. If there is any criticism to
be made, it is that it presents a picture of English life that is
totally false. One reason for its success in the United States is that
it shows Americans an England they like to believe exists, one full of
chinless wonders and assorted toffs wandering the green lawns of country
houses sipping champagne.
But she is out for bigger fish and the film is just an excuse to wage
war. Mrs Whitehouse is a censorship freak. It is interesting that her
demand -- she has long since retired as head of the Viewers and
Listeners Association -- co-incided with the BBFC report which reveals
deep unease about the extent to which censors should usurp individual
responsibility. It also reveals that since the passing of the 1994
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act the BBFC has been intervening
heavily.
It enforced wholesale cuts in the Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller, True
Lies, a violent film by any standards, and Tarantino's Pulp Fiction,
where again the violence is extreme. Both films play the violence for
laughs. The BBFC is also dubious about its role as surrogate parent.
Under the Act it is required to treat each and every video as if it were
harmful to children, although only one third of British households
contain children.
Lord Harewood, the chairman, revealed that more videos were rejected
in 1994-95 than at any time since 1988, while others had been cut.
As far as Four Weddings, which is out on video, was concerned there
were no complaints, but 34 parents did complain about the drag comedy,
Mrs Doubtfire, when it was shown in the cinema. They complained because
it was given a 12 certificate which excluded their younger children from
seeing it. The fact is that adults should be allowed to decide for
themselves what they wish to see, and the task of protecting children
should rest with their parents. The present guidelines are adequate,
provided parents observe them. It presents problems in the multi-set
household, but that is no reason for abdicating responsibility.

SINCE the Forestry Commission began selling off woodland in 1981, as
part of the Government's privatisation programme, 801 forests in
Scotland have been sold off, covering some 180,000 woodland acres.
The Government's own figures culled from parliamentary answers in
Hansard show that since the introduction of access agreements in 1991,
220 Scottish forests have been sold. Only one, at Comrie, the 50-acre
Cowden Wood has a public access agreement.
Between January and August this year alone, according to the Ramblers
Association, public access has been lost to 39 Scottish woodlands
disposed off by the Forestry Commission ranging from Glenbreakerie's
2400 acres in Strathclyde to 16 acres at Tighnabruaich.
Figures available for 1991 and 1992 show that, among forests sold
without access agreements was the Menzion forest in the Borders, 2500
acres of woodland, for a reputed #1.5m. In Central region 130 acres of
forestry at Craignavie was sold for #75,000. In Dumfries and Galloway
around 100 acres of Roundstonefoot forest was sold. Harran Hill Wood in
Fife, around 50 acres, found a buyer.
Among woodlands sold in Grampian was Glasslaw forest (120 acres),
Coral Brae (50 acres), Drumnagair (24 acres) and Hillhead at Newlands
(35 acres). The list of forests sold in Highland region includes Achibeg
(60 acres), Borlum Wood (100 acres), Gledfield (125 acres) and the Loch
Rosque Plantation (125 acres). In Strathclyde, in the same year,
Allanfauld and Drumness forest (90 acres), and the Watermeetings
Plantation (1800 acres) found new buyers. In Tayside, the list inlcudes
Binn Wood (56 acres), Glenlyon at Innerwick (300 acres).
In 1992, 360 acres of Allargue Forest in Grampian was sold along with
Broomfold (25 acres), and Smallburn (15 acres). In the Highlands the
Glen Etive Plantation (4202 acres) was sold, along with around 600 acres
of woodland at Strathcuilleannach. In Strathclyde Lot 1 of Carrick Wood
(160 acres) was sold along with 870 acres of woodland at Todlaw.

THE traditional freedom to roam Scotland's woodlands is being lost.
The failure of a Government policy which was supposed to protect legal
access for walkers in the sell-off of Forestry Commission land means 219
forests sold since 1991 are now out of bounds to walkers.
Inquiries by The Herald have disclosed that only one legal access
agreement has been signed, covering just 50 acres of the 66,000 acres of
woodland sold off since the measure was introduced.
The problem affects woodlands throughout the UK. The Ramblers'
Association claims an area equivalent in size to the Isle of Wight --
135 square miles -- has been lost to the public throughout the UK. But
it is particularly acute in Scotland, where the Forestry Commission owns
a quarter of the land.
It was in 1981 that the Government decided the Forestry Commission
should start selling off woodland. Since then 2635 forests -- covering
some 300,000 acres -- have moved into private hands in England, Wales,
and Scotland. That means that from owning around 50% of the UK's
woodlands, the commission now holds 40%.
The freedom to roam in forests owned by the state has no status in
law. But free access for walkers is enshrined in the Forestry
Commission's policy documents.
It was the threat to that traditional freedom which persuaded the
Government to bow to pressure from environmentalists in the eighties,
when it became clear that access to privatised woodland was being lost
in the sell-off. A new policy implemented in 1991 meant that when the
commission selected land for sale, they would offer local authorities
the chance to enter into an access agreement which would be binding on
the new owner and any subsequent buyers.
But since then, while 27 agreements have been reached with the new
owners of woodlands in England and Wales, only one such deal has been
struck in Scotland, in a small forest bought by a farmer in Tayside.
''That constitutes freedom to roam in one-tenth of 1% of the woodland
sold off,'' said David Biskin of the Ramblers' Association. The
organisation, keen to shake off its old image as the bobbly-hat brigade,
has been campaigning with other environmental pressure groups to keep
land open to the public.
The association wants the further sale of forests halted until what it
describes as the ''shambles'' of current policy is sorted out.
This is not the first signal the Government has had that the policy is
not working. In February 1994 a report drawn up by an interdepartmental
team of civil servants was placed in the House of Commons library. With
a long-winded title, The Report of the Committee of Civil Servants
Looking Into the Effectiveness of the Measure to Protect Access When
Forestry Commission Woods Are Sold, it was perhaps understandable that
it did not grab headlines.
It did, however, offer proof that the policy on access was failing to
offer adequate protection. It stated: ''This group has . . . reached the
conclusion that in the absence of public ownership, the most promising
means of securing continued public access is likely to be through
primary legislation.'' It was recommending, in other words, that the
Government ought to legislate to protect access to those woodlands sold
off.
It described the current arrangements, involving the Forestry
Commission and local authorities in drawing up legally enforceable
documents, as ''bureaucratic'' and ''time-consuming''.
While improvements could be made to the arrangements: ''It would
remain at best a bureaucratic system providing only piecemeal
site-by-site protection, depending on whether the relevant local
authority was willing and able to become involved.''
Davis Morris, the Ramblers' Association spokesman in Scotland, said it
was vital that the tradition of access to forestry lands should remain:
''Surely we cannot leave public access to the whim of the private
landowners? No other European country would accept that. In most other
European and Scandinavian countries you are guaranteed access to public
and private forests.''
Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Forsyth also holds the UK
brief of Forestry Minister. Mr Morris said that he had explained the
situation to him and Scottish Forestry Minister Lord Lindsay when they
met earlier this year:
''We would urge Mr Forsyth to investigate the situation now, before it
is too late, to see what disastrous arrangements his predecessors have
made to safeguard public access as state forests are sold.''
All calls on the issue were yesterday referred by Mr Forsyth's office
to a Forestry Commission spokesman. He claimed that when forests are to
be disposed of, it is generally woodland that has little or no existing
public access.
The commission had given every encouragement to local authorities to
become involved in drawing up legally enforceable agreements on public
access. There were 28 agreements on forests already sold in the UK, and
a further 44 on woodland currently on the market.
The current policy might be time-consuming, he conceded, but that
didn't mean it wasn't working. New guidelines would be issued shortly,
taking on board the complexities of the procedure. However, he insisted:
''It is effective on safeguarding public access. There is no other way
of doing it. If I sold you a woodland which says you must allow access
and you sell on to someone else, the agreement is void. The only way
around it is to use existing legislation under the Wildlife and
Countryside Act.''
It was not surprising that local authorities were not taking up the
offer of agreements. It was a completely new thing, only introduced in
1991: ''The response now is more encouraging.''
In defending the indefensibility of a policy that is not working it
was a valiant attempt, but no amount of spin can doctor the blunt fact
that only one small forest in Scotland has been sold with an access
agreement.
A spokesman for the Scottish Land Owners' Federation was able to offer
one obvious clue to the difficulties: ''I have heard it said by valuers
that if there is public access to a wood, its open-market value is
diminished.''
Mr Duncan Thomson added that the Forestry Commission had to do a
balancing act between achieving the best sale price for the disposal of
an estate and allowing for continued public access.
Government legislation might not be easy to achieve, he thought: ''I
think it's easy to generalise about public access but there are all
sorts of different circumstances. In some woods, the public never go
there. I think where the public have access and are enjoying access to
woods it would be bad if the disposal of the wood prevented public
access in the future.''
LAND UP FOR GRABS
IN a parliamentary answer on October 18 this year Mr George Kynoch
gave a list of all Foresty Commission woodlands currently for sale on
the open market in Scotland.
These were:
Borders: Edgarhope and Priesthaugh.
Dumfries and Galloway: Dalquhairn and Glenshimmeroch.
Grampian: Auchinroath Plantation, Auqharney, Drybridge Woodlands,
Glenbuchat, Hillockhead, Malcolm Wood, Rhynagoup Woods, Rosarie Strip,
Tulloch Wood and the Wangie Plantations.
Highlands: The Avriachan Plantation, Achrugan, Culdrach Plantation,
Tote Plantation and the Uig Plantation.
Strathclyde: Ardmarnock, Caladh, Crookedstane, Daljarrock, Dererach
Plantation, Docherneil, Glenmard, Little Clyde, Scoor Wood (part) and
Uluvalt.
Tayside: Camusericht, Upper Glenprosen and Warroch.

Patrick Brogan analyses the US government shutdown and predicts a
Democrats coup if the President stands his ground
THERE were negotiations up till midnight on Monday to avert the
shutting down of the US government, to no avail. The Republican leaders,
Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole, wanted to appear reasonable, and so did the
President, so Mr Clinton summoned Republicans and Democrats together to
the White House.
Nothing came of it, besides a late-night press conference and an
agreement that officials from both sides should meet again today, and
continue talking until the dispute is resolved. The government therefore
shut down this morning, or at least its inessential parts did.
No doubt it will reopen in a few days. No doubt, too, President
Clinton and Congress will each claim victory when Congress drops its
more outrageous demands and the President agrees that balancing the
budget is a good idea. This is the latest skirmish in a major battle,
and the war will resume later this month, full force.
Mr Clinton vetoed two measures on Monday. First, he rejected a
Congressional proposal to raise the ceiling on the national debt. Then
he vetoed a Bill (known as a continuing resolution) that would allow the
government to spend money for another three weeks, while the budget is
completed and voted into law. It is this second veto that forced the
government to close down.
The Treasury in theory will reach the present debt limit in a few
days' time, and the United States will then default. The debt ceiling,
set by law, has to be raised at regular intervals to allow the
government to borrow to finance the annual deficit (about $160bn this
year). The present limit is $4.9 trillion.
It is an immense sum and deficit hawks in Congress have sworn that
they will end ''robbing our children to pay for wasteful and profligate
government'' as they put it. Indeed, if they refuse to raise the debt
ceiling, they will balance the budget in one fell swoop, but at a cost
their constituents would never forgive.
They tried to use the government's need to borrow money to force the
President to accept their nostrums for balancing the budget. Mr Clinton
refused. What is more, they added to the Bill (and to the continuing
resolution) a series of social and political measures that the President
opposes. The idea was that he would not allow the country to default.
It's bluff, and Mr Clinton has called the bluff. Besides, the Treasury
can fudge the issue for several weeks, borrowing money from various
trust funds to pay interest on its bonds.
The continuing resolution is needed because Congress failed to pass
the budget on time. The law provides that the budget must be passed
every summer and then 13 appropriations Bills must go through Congress,
one for each major department and agency. The process is meant to be
completed by September 30, the end of the financial year.
This year's budget is immense and very important. It is the
Republicans' proposal for revolutionising the government, changing the
entire welfare and medical insurance systems and balancing the budget by
2002. They hope to finish it this week but may take a few days more.
They have passed three of the appropriations Bills in the meantime (Mr
Clinton vetoed one of them), so two departments, agriculture and defence
construction, can continue as normal, at least until their figures are
revised by the main budget legislation.
As for the remaining departments, all 11, spending $1500bn a year
(that's $4000m a day), that all ended on October 1. This happens most
years, and Congress passes a continuing resolution, allowing the
government to stay in business. This year, the resolution extended the
deadline until November 13. That was Monday -- and because Mr Clinton
vetoed the new resolution, the government, in theory, stops.
He did so because instead of simply extending financial authority for
a period, as it did in its first resolution, Congress demanded that Mr
Clinton accept a whole slew of other provisions, including gutting fresh
air and clean water legislation, cutting student loans, abolishing the
Commerce Department, repealing clauses of the last gun-control act,
raising Medicare premiums and cutting overall government spending by
40%.
Republicans claim that their narrow victory in last year's
congressional elections entitles them to revise the entire system of
government wholesale. They have not explained clearly what balancing the
budget means, nor restructuring welfare, nor its effects on education,
the environment or government regulation.
They admit that Medicare premiums will rise by $20 or so in the next
few years -- but conceal that they will double after 2002 while the
share of government spending on Medicare and welfare will be cut
savagely.
They have wrapped up their entire political philosophy into one
enormous package, and they will present it to the President by the end
of the month. Today's dispute over the debt ceiling and the continuing
resolution is a first engagement in that battle.
If Mr Clinton had accepted the premises of the two Bills, including
reducing government spending by 40% and raising Medicare premiums, he
would have lost the war. The 40% would have been a floor to
negotiations, and he would have been lucky to push it back to a 10 or
20% cut.
Democrats have been hammering on these points continuously for the
past year, and it seems that at last they have made themselves heard.
There were local elections in various parts of the country last week,
and the Republicans did far worse than they expected.
What is more, the public perception of Newt Gingrich, the Republicans'
chief revolutionary, is overwhelmingly negative. He is seen as a cross
between Scrooge and Bill Sykes. They now claim a mandate to turn the
American government on its head but Americans are increasingly uneasy at
their prescriptions.
Like all true revolutionaries, they know that they must complete their
programme at once, or they will be defeated by the natural lethargy of
reaction.
This time, they will have to compromise. But then will come the
battles over the budget (known as a reconciliation Bill), and the
individual departmental appropriations. Mr Clinton will probably veto
the reconciliation Bill, and will certainly veto many of the
appropriations Bills.
So the fight will resume, this time with individual departments
hovering on the brink, rather than the whole government.
Who wins will depend on public perceptions. And that, in turn, will
depend in part on how this week's dispute works out. If the public can
be persuaded that Mr Clinton is defending the old folk, the environment
and education against the axe-murderers in Capitol Hill, then he will be
able to hold the line in the budget battles ahead.
Then next year's election campaign theme will be set out, with the
President, and perhaps even congressional Democrats, better placed than
they dared hope last summer, when the Republicans were riding high.
Of course, if Mr Clinton caves in this week, or when the budget and
appropriations Bills reach him, the revolutionaries will have won, and
the Democrats can prepare for many years in the wilderness.

It may well be
all right on the
night, but only
after a lot of
planning and
rehearsal. But
never fear . . .
John Davidson
is on hand
to direct the
proceedings
HOW TO turn a crisis into a drama? That is the real challenge of
night-time dressing. It is the process of finding the perfect little
black dress. The most wonderful earrings. The loveliest shoes. And the
desired effect? A statement of style which is yours alone.
Who says that little girls get all the best frocks? Behind all the
overstatement of high-fashion imagery as we normally view it, there is a
wonderful world of beautiful clothes for real women, not beanpole
12-year-olds. Women, that is, who have a poise and confidence which
comes from knowing what really suits them and (just as importantly)
which hot new fashion thing can -- and can not -- work for them. Women
who can carry off a touch of theatricality. Women with that real sense
of personal style.
Step backstage at the Hackney Empire, and meet a legend in the making.
For here we have a vision of grown-up glamour which actually flatters a
woman much more than any skinny little girl. Shapely and sexy (but not
ridiculously revealing) this is style which echoes the mood of the
moment, but meets the needs of the woman who would rather wear a
delicate lacy bra by Valentino than a polyester satin Wonderbra.
Yet in the topsy-turvey fashion world, what exactly is the mood of the
moment? In contrast to the relaxation of so many dress codes and the
casual ease of contemporary daytime clothing, there is a return to
formality in evening wear. But rather than the overblown grandeur of
elaborate ballgowns -- to accommodate in a taxi let alone any modern
lifestyle -- this new formality is expressed in a spare, modern, unfussy
elegance.
Of course, less can only ever mean more when those little bits of less
are so much more carefully considered. And when decoration is kept to a
minimum, choices of fabric and colour are of primary importance. Start
with satin, its subtle sheen not perhaps as wholly forgiving as a crepe
or georgette, yet in its film star quality quite irresistible. Or choose
matte jersey, re-emerging once more as a cutting-edge fashion choice.
And for colour, well, nothing ever looks quite as wonderful as black.
Just as some designers are at their most masterful in elaborately
decorated clothes, others come into their own when minimalism is the
thing. Then there is a small third group of individuals able to imbue
something quite simple and very refined with additional qualities like
grace and a subtle femininity. At the very height of his powers, such
was the consummate skill of Givenchy. It is exactly what women love
about Jasper Conran's clothes. And it is the magical ingredient in
Alberta Ferretti's wonderful evening wear.
There is little doubt that the chances of finding your dream frock are
greater if you can afford the premium of a designer label. But a sense
of taste and style depends on careful editing and sound judgment -- not
scale of expenditure. The high street is no longer a glamour-free zone.
Just try, try, try before you buy. For, like every great theatrical
production, night-time glamour needs a lot of work at the rehearsal
stage. Regardless of the budget.

Jennifer Cunningham meets a couple who successfully mixed and matched
HERE'S a hot tip for anyone thinking of setting up a dating agency or
even just doing a bit of private matchmaking: don't ask what they find
attractive in the opposite sex, don't match hobbies, sports or taste in
music, just find out if they throw their shoes in a heap or pick the
crumbs out of the toaster.
Ona Lydis and Allan Ramsay consider themselves pretty clued-up on the
matchmaking mores. Newly-engaged and planning their wedding for
February, they are happy to tell the world they met through a dating
agency -- and, if necessary, that they both throw their shoes on the
floor and de-crumb the toaster.
Both in their mid-thirties, they say they feel uncomfortable going to
pubs and clubs. Ona wanted to meet someone with the same sort of job
status as she has (she's a hotel manager), while Allan says he feels the
girls he's likely to encounter in nightclubs might ask for help with
their homework.
''By the time you get to our age, most of your friends are married,
and functions such as dinner dances are all couples. People move around
so much more, that you are not with a group of friends who introduce you
to other friends. I think dating agencies are an ideal way to meet
people, because there are huge numbers of single people about, but there
is nowhere for them to go,'' says Ona.
She has a horror of lonely hearts columns in newspapers, particularly
the dangerous possibilities of an assignation with someone quite unknown
and unvetted.
She had just ended a four-year relationship with someone she had met
through a dating agency. ''We kept seeing each other, but we knew we
weren't going to settle down together,'' she added. She then joined the
Dunblane-based Initial Approach, because she liked the sound of an
agency which guaranteed to have interviewed all the people on its books
-- and had a non-stop social life going out with different men.
''To be honest, I was getting a bit fed up because I was getting too
many invitations, so I would just meet people for a cup of coffee and
advise them to look through their list of profiles.'' She says she would
never refuse to meet anyone because that would be unfair.
Allan was not one of the people who rang her up, although she was on
his list of women the agency thought would be suitable.
Sandra Menoni, who runs Initial Approach had written down Ona's name
on his form when she was interviewing him. He, however, was in such
demand that he did not get round to calling any of them, but admits now
that he did look through them all and decided Ona was rather too like
one of his sisters.
The pair finally met at a ghost walk in Stirling -- one of the
occasions organised by the agency for people to meet in a group rather
than on a one-to one-basis. ''I saw Allan as soon as I walked into the
room, it was the curly hair that attracted me, but he was talking to
someone else,'' says Ona.
They were seated at the same table at dinner and Allan certainly
noticed her, but decided she was very quiet and probably at her first
occasion event. Since then, he's discovered she rarely stops talking,
while he claims he would rate a 10 on a shyness scale of one to five.
That's partly why he was rather reluctant to join a dating agency and
certainly had no intention of telling any of his workmates that he'd
done so. ''It's a very male environment and there's not much chance to
meet any women,'' says Allan, an engineer currently supervising a
welding project. After meeting his fellow members, however, he thinks it
is simply a good social move.
Both Allan and Ona work shifts and have made a number of career-led
moves between England and Scotland and, in Ona's case, to the United
States. They feel they are typical of a generation which is much more
mobile than their parents' one but as a result lacks a ready-made social
network.
After the ghost walk, Alan asked the agency for Ona's number, not
realising he already had it, and they went to a few more occasions,
before being banned for being a couple. ''We've met a lot of really nice
people at these events, especially some of the older women. There are
quite a few of them who are really good fun, but all the older men seem
to want younger women,'' Ona says. Both say that although most people
have an age-group in mind when they are looking for a partner, age
becomes irrelevant once the chemistry takes over.
They would unhesitatingly advise single people to join an agency, one
which holds events for members, which give people the chance to meet
without the pressure of a one-to-one date.
Allan had asked for a woman no older than 36, but he stretched a point
when Sandra suggested his ideal lady might be 37. She was Ona, of
course. Sandra and her staff are invited to the wedding, which will be
the eighth since the agency opened -- and there were 12 more engaged
couples at the last count. ''I think there is a trend back towards
marriage. Nearly everyone is looking for long-term commitment,'' says
Menoni, who clearly relishes playing fairy godmother. Shouldn't we be
asking, though, why so many attractive, hard-working, thoroughly normal
people need her services?

Judy Mackie finds that dating is a game with rules that are rather
hard to follow
CAN cold computer logic ignite the flame of romance between two
strangers -- or must a combination of chemistry and fate take a hand in
kindling that vital spark? It's a question television producer Catherine
Sloyan set out to answer in her Grampian TV lifestyle series One Life To
Live, with The Dating Game -- a North-east (and far nicer) version of
Blind Date. And, being single and forty-something, with little spare
time to meet a potential partner, she confesses to having a vested
interest.
''Quite often my work seems to involve situations I find myself in
personally. I know how hard it is to find a partner when you work long
hours and your friends have all settled down and you no longer want to
spend evenings in loud, crowded nightclubs, so I thought I'd test out
the computer dating idea on TV. If it can work for others, then it could
work for me,'' she says.
Wearing her heart on her sleeve, Sloyan appeared on TV and radio to
encourage potential ''guinea pigs'' to come forward, by explaining her
own problems with finding the elusive Mr Right. ''I had to do it -- I
couldn't expect people to come forward and admit the dark and dreadful
secret that they're single and lonely, without standing up to be counted
myself.''
The response was cautious, but eventually 22 people volunteered and
their details were forwarded to computer dating agency Dateline. The
plan was to announce -- and film -- the results at an evening reception
in Aberdeen, but not before Sloyan discovered that the course of true
matchmaking, far from being smooth, was uphill all the way.
Dateline, understandably, with such a small pool of people, had been
unable to pair everyone off neatly. It was up to Catherine Sloyan to
play Cilla and suss out who would suit whom.
''I ended up going out to pubs and clubs to meet everyone
individually, and I got very involved in the whole thing. I was
determined that they would meet someone they got on with, but it was
very hard work,'' she says.
Eventually, theoretical matches were made and the guinea pigs -- all
lively, attractive people in their twenties, thirties and forties --
gathered in a West End restaurant for the big announcement.
Marion Hendry, aged 37, from Friockheim, near Arbroath, was one of
them. A slim, red-headed divorcee with three children, she had travelled
to Aberdeen alone, without telling anyone what she was about to do.
''I was fed up being single -- I got divorced six years ago -- and
although I'd joined a cycling club and went out every so often with my
friends, I wasn't meeting anyone I was remotely interested in having a
relationship with. When I saw an ad for The Dating Game, I thought, why
not have a go?'' she says.
During the meal, Hendry met an attractive and interesting man. The two
hit it off instantly and discovered a mutual love of outdoor activities.
Surely they would be paired off by the computer, they thought . . .
Wrong. Hendry's partner turned out to be the proverbial damp squib.
Her new friend (who must remain anonymous so as not to spoil the
surprise for viewers) was also disappointed, especially when he
discovered his computer partner hated sports of all kinds.
In the meantime, things were not working out for one of the other
couples. The man -- a large, dark-haired extrovert, made the ultimate
social gaffe when meeting a woman for the first time, of throwing his
partner -- a slim, rather shy blonde -- over his shoulder and parading
round the room amid howls of laughter. Exit shy blonde from both
restaurant and television series.
But the evening was far from a disaster. Sloyan admits many of the
couples were dismayed by the person picked for them by computer, but
others, she says, were pleasantly surprised and everyone agreed to meet
up again so their progress could be charted by the television crew.
Hendry decided to give her date one more chance, but after he got lost
and turned up two hours late for dinner the door had well and truly been
slammed on that relationship. But Marion had another idea. She arranged
to go out with the man she had been attracted to on the first evening.
Viewers will discover the outcome later this month.
Sloyan remains tight-lipped about the overall outcome of her
experiment, but she insists that whatever happens, it was not a waste of
time.
''Most of the people involved had fun and have at least made new
friends.''

SCOTTISH meat eaters appear resistant to fears about so-called mad cow
disease, despite recent adverse media reports.
Butchers, poultry dealers, and supermarket staff said yesterday there
had been no dramatic changes in eating habits in recent weeks.
Mr James Allan, a partner in a company which operates 15 butcher shops
across the central belt, said there was little evidence to date of
customers being scared off by negative publicity about BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy).
He pointed out that most Scottish butchers traditionally received
their supplies from farmers of beef cattle, rather than dairy herds,
which have tended to be associated with the disease.
Mr Allan said trade in recent months had been slack, but ascribed this
to the hot summer weather and a general move towards white meat, often
used with convenience sauces.
His views were broadly echoed by Mr Martin Murray, a director of
Martin Quality Foods, which has five butcher shops in Glasgow and also
runs a wholesale supply operation.
He said: ''I am concerned about adverse publicity but I think the
public are fed up with scare stories, especially when experts can't
agree with each other.''
Supermarkets and poultry dealers said the white meat market had
improved recently, but added that the trend probably had more to do with
general changes in diet than BSE scares.
Mrs Sheena Dunsmore, manager of Bridge of Allan-based dealers Classic
Poultry, said: ''People take a while to change their eating habits but
more and more are realising that meats such as turkey and venison are
now available.''
A spokeswoman for Asda supermarkets added: ''People are fairly used to
BSE scares now. It is not as sensational as it was and people realise
that a lot of safety checks are made.''

INTERNATIONAL Service Systems (ISS) Europe announced yesterday that it
intends to establish a major foothold in Scotland with the acquisition
of Edinburgh-based Northern Maintenance.
The deal is expected to be completed by November 30. Although the
purchase price has not been set, ISS confirmed that payment would be
made in cash.
Northern Maintenance, which has more than 900 employees, generated
approximately #3m in turnover in the year to October, with pre-tax
profits of about #200,000. Northern founder and chairman William
Buchanan said exact figures were not available while company accountants
were still preparing for closure of the deal.
Indeed, both Mr Buchanan and director of operations Bruce Cochrane
expressed suprise at what they viewed as the early announcement of the
acquisition.
''I don't doubt that it's all going to go ahead, but we haven't
actually come to a deal yet,'' Mr Cochrane said.
ISS is buying the full share capital of Northern Maintenance, which
comprises William and Christine Buchanan's 78% and the remaining 22%
share owned by Bruce and Ishbel Cochrane. The Buchanans will retire upon
completion of the acquisition, while Bruce Cochrane will remain with the
company as operations director for ISS in Scotland.
Northern has been handling subcontracting in Scotland for ISS for
about 12 months. Ken Pepper, managing director of ISS UK, said that
after working with the Edinburgh company, ISS viewed the acquisition as
offering a promising inroad to the Scottish markets.
''At this moment in time we actually have very little business
dealings in Scotland,'' he said, ''so we saw this as an opportunity to
grow''.
Mr Pepper described the Northern Maintenance client list as ''blue
chip''. It numbers approximately 200 businesses, including Compaq, BT
and Sun Microsystems. He added that they would fit in well with existing
operations at ISS.
Although Northern's primary area of business has been in office
cleaning, Mr Pepper said ISS planned to use its financial prowess to
take it into new areas such as food hygiene and airport services.
In 1994 ISS A/S, parent company of ISS UK, achieved a turnover of
#1500m and pre-tax profits of #75.3m. It employs 135,000 people in 34
countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas.

DEAR readers be warned. Promiscuity is a terrible thing. Succumb to
temptation and ye will reap shame, humiliation, and the deepest of
regrets. Take heed from one who has suffered. From one who should have
known better, from one who ignored all advice.
I've been unfaithful. I've been a flirt. I've played the field and now
I'm paying the price, and the penalty has been truly awful. A woman in
her late twenties should know that the one person she should be faithful
to is her hairdresser. I ignored the golden rule and now I'm in a slough
of despond.
Everyone has experienced the misery of a bad hair day and I'm going
through the grand depression of a bad hair year. A dependence on hats is
my penance for my lack of fidelity to the man in my life who put life in
my hair.
Cameron Sculpture, whose tasteful salon in the West End of Glasgow
catered for my every tonsorial need, saw me through the highs and lows
of bobs and crops. He's all you could ask of a hairdresser, as skilful
at psychology as he is with scissors, supplying care, concern, and sage
advice about my love life with some entertaining dirty stories to boot.
Not to mention a mean cup of coffee.
But was I satisfied? Was I grateful for my lot? Did I appreciate him
and thank the lucky stars which had guided me to his door? Did I heck. I
took Cameron and his hair sculpture for granted and fell prey to the
grass-is-always-greener syndrome, knowing I had it good but fantasising
about it being better.
I sniffed around. I eyed up the competition. I had illicit thoughts
about straying, fingers flicking through the Yellow Pages. Then,
stricken by guilt, I would keep my regular appointment with Cameron. But
the seeds of sin had been planted. The very immorality of it made the
thought of betrayal all the more enticing.
So I sought my thrills with strangers and gave in to wicked impulses,
slipping through the doors of new establishments and wilfully offering
myself --or at least my head -- to new hands. And all Cameron's good
work was gradually destroyed.
Sometimes the experiences would be good. I would leave the salon
feeling exhilarated and looking fine, but the excitement soon wore off.
Well, there was no intimacy between me and these strangers. No shared
history, no laughs. And indeed, more often than not it would all go
hideously wrong. I'd leave the offending salon deflated and disappointed
with a bad haircut and a bad case of the blues, knowing that it was no
more than I deserved.
And then I would think wistfully of Cameron and his gentle touch but I
was too racked with guilt to return. My flippant encounters with others
had soiled our precious relationship. The knowledge of my dalliances
would have stopped me from looking him in the eyes. One glance at my mop
and he would realise the full extent of my promiscuity and would surely
be horrified.
No, my bad hair year has been my just desert from straying from the
path of righteousness, for breaking the holy bond between woman and
hairdresser. It's a strange one. Women expect more from their
hairdresser than a blow dry.
As well as wanting hairdressers to have the magical powers of a fairy
godmother -- effecting transformation from ugly duckling to beautiful
princess with one flick of the wrist -- we want them to be therapist,
psychiatrist, and friend. At Sculpture I would settle back into the
chair, or rather perch mincingly on it as it was a trendy, spindly
thing, and treat Cameron like my father confessor, spilling my darkest
secrets while he spilled my hair.
We want our egos as well as our heads massaged. We want compliments
and confirmation. When we finish a relationship and, seathing with rage
and resentment, feel that animal need to chop something off and we take
the pinking shears to our locks we expect our hairdressers to nod
sympathetically, refrain from censure, and repair the damage, both
tonsorial and emotional.
They should be great conversationalists. The stereotype of inane
hairdressers asking vacant questions about vacations is an insult to a
great profession. The contemporary coiffeur delivers great crack. If a
hairdresser asks you where you're going on your holidays you know that
you are in the hands of a cowboy. In this instance your only option is
to rise screaming from the chair and run from the salon, hair sodden
with suds and all.
But they also have to make you feel special. Women are possessive
about their hairdressers in the same way men are possessive about rock
bands. We want our hairdresser to be our little secret, our special
success. We want to have discovered them first. Just as men get miffed
if their favoured indy band hits big time and starts playing to
stadiums, we get narked when our hairdresser becomes Mr Popular and we
have to book our appointments weeks in advance.
When all my mates complimented me on my haircuts, ask for the name of
the salon, and started booking Cameron up I prickled with resentment.
Hold on, that wasn't supposed to happen. He was supposed to be mine, all
mine. How dare they be friends with him. And so I sulked, and so I
strayed.
I bottled out of last week's contemplation of a bottle of bleach but I
would be straying yet if I hadn't been jolted to my senses by
practically plummeting to the depths of depravity and indulging in a
sordid encounter, in a night club, no less. At Cafe Loco in the Arches
last weekend I contemplated a one-night stand -- with the chaps
performing free haircuts on dissolute clubbers.
As I was about to deliver myself to their hands, in yet another
desperate attempt to free myself from my bad-hair-year curse, I hit
enlightenment and stopped in my tracks. It was time to return to
Cameron. Time to become the prodigal client, slink into Sculpture, bleat
mea culpa and beg for giveness. I just hope he'll take me back. I'm a
lost and wanton woman otherwise.

RECENT letters have criticised the irresponsible and disrespectful
attitudes of some of today's youth. Sadly in his response to those
letters John Carlyle (November 13) epitomises those very failings in
referring to his elders as ''greyheids and wrinklies'' who are ''on the
slow march to the grave''.
I have news for him. He is on the same march, and, somewhere along it,
he may learn that if people (of whatever age or station) don't have
respect for one another he will come to inhabit an even less caring
world than the one in which he now lives.
I sense his pacifist leanings and respect them, but he may also want
to consider what sort of country Scotland would be now if young men of
previous generations hadn't taken up arms against our enemies.
Now, so many of them tend to kill each other.

WHAT on earth is the Commission on Children and Violence thinking of
in recommending that the age of criminal responsibility be raised to 14?
Such a move would not mean that under-14-year-old offenders would
receive care instead of punishment. It would actually mean that nothing
would be done to or about them, no matter what they did. A 12 or
13-year-old could, theoretically, carry out a Hungerford type massacre,
go home afterwards, and the police would not be able to touch him.
Of course this particular scenario is unlikely, but what could happen,
and does in countries with a high age of criminal responsibility, is
that drug gangs use children a year or two too young to be charged as
couriers and pay them well for this service.
In Italy, the Mafia does this, and there is evidence of it in England,
where little is done until a child is 15.
If this recommendation goes through, how will parents teach children
that crime doesn't pay when the children can see for themselves not only
that it does but that they can commit all the crimes they want until
they are 14?
In Scotland we can deal with a child over eight who offends, in the
Children's Panel. Such a child's background is investigated and if
she/he was merely up to mischief, a telling off, plus the shame and
shock of going in front of the panel, is usually enough.
If there are deeper problems, or if the parents turn out to have
taught her/him to steal, other avenues can be explored. Our system is
not perfect but I understand juvenile crime here is decreasing, unlike
England where it is soaring.
Going ahead with this plan would be folly.

THIS has not been a good year for British Gas. In fact there has not
been a good year for the company for some time. The decline and fall of
the reputation of British Gas has been both sudden and dramatic.
It is quite recent history when only Marks &amp; Sparks rivalled British
Gas in public esteem. Times have changed.
The catalogue of British Gas mishap continues unabated. In the past
few weeks the gas regulator has openly mused about the possibility of
the company going bust. Then it was discovered that British Gas
engineers were being encouraged to sell people new boilers whether they
needed them or not. These latest misfortunes come on top of the
thousands of job losses, the hundreds of showroom closures, and the
memorable dust-up over the celebrated salary rise of chief executive
Cedric Brown.
The company fat cats did, however, hit on a brilliant solution to
avoid the indignity of having their Charter Mark for consumer service
withdrawn -- they resigned from the scheme.
Jumping before you are pushed hasn't yet spread to the British Gas
boardroom. This is despite the fact that just about every director
available for re-election was given a resounding thumbs down by the
small shareholders present and voting at this year's annual meeting in
the Docklands, before they were all rescued by the faceless
institutional investors.
We have now reached the position where even those of us with great
reservations about the introduction of competition into the domestic gas
market are reconciled to the thought that it could hardly be worse than
the present situation.
To be fair to the company it is largely the onset of that competition
which has provoked the past two years of total confusion at strategic
level.
However, the shadow of British Gas will still loom large over the
market-place even when the new companies are allowed to supply the
general consumer. There are two issues at present which have fundamental
implications for the gas market. In both, the public and the Scottish
interest are in severe jeopardy.
The first of those lies in pricing. Gas prices on the spot market have
been at very low levels this year. British Gas has severe problems with
the low prices since it has a large number of contracts for buying gas
at fixed prices, running in some cases at up to double the current
market price.
There has been some speculation that the company might renege on some
of these contracts. However, there is another way out for British Gas
which I suspect is the route it has been taking.
It may have succeeded in persuading the regulator, Clare Spottiswoode,
to allow it to divide its contracts between the domestic market, where
there is still no competition, and the industrial market, where it has
already lost substantial market share to its competitors.
If British Gas is allowed to allocate its high-price contracts to the
former and its low-price contracts to the latter, it will help to get
the company out of a tight corner. Of course it will mean that you and I
pay much higher gas bills than market prices say we should be paying.
If Mrs Spottiswoode is prepared to countenance such a fancy piece of
footwork, it would effectively end any pretence that Ofgas exists to
defend the consumer interest. Certainly I cannot imagine that her thrawn
Scottish predecessor, James McKinnon, would have entertained such a
barefaced wheeze.
There is a second issue where the activities of British Gas threaten
to operate against the Scottish public interest.
The pipelines, transportation and storage business of the company is
now operated by its subsidiary, TransCo. TransCo has been developing a
new charging policy for the delivery of gas to its eventual destination
for the various landfall terminals around the country.
However the charges are not just for transporting the gas but for
landing it and getting it into the network. It proposes to make those
''entry charges'' to the system for St Fergus in Aberdeenshire almost 18
times the entry charge for Bacton in Norfolk, where the gas
interconnector to the mainland of Europe is due to be based.
TransCo's defence of those charges is that they are necessary to stop
yet more producers landing gas at St Fergus which would lead to further
investment commitments to upgrade the pipeline south.
However, informed word in the oil industry is that even when a
producing company offered to meet the cost of upgrading the pipeline
capacity from St Fergus, TransCo refused to guarantee entry into the
system.
The implications for Scotland are clear. These entry charges will make
St Fergus less competitive than the four English landfalls. Scotland's
gas, now being produced in ever-larger quantities, will be piped south
through offshore pipelines without being processed, having its value
added, and thus producing downstream jobs in Scotland.
A few years back I warned of the Great Gas Robbery where gas from the
central North Sea was similarly siphoned off to Teesside through the
subsidised Cats pipeline. British Gas was up to its neck in that spot of
economic larceny as the majority shareholder in the pipeline.
Now through the TransCo charges British Gas has returned to the scene
of the crime and once again Scotland is likely to be the victim.

THE ineptitude of our Prime Minister continues. Why did not the French
carry out their nuclear test off their own coast? Because of the
possibility of error and catastrophe -- even yet. Why hold it anywhere
on this fragile planet, then? Conclusion: it should not have been held.
John Major has backed the wrong horse, as usual. At least he should
have phoned all the Prime Ministers on the Pacific rim and explained
himself before the conference. And if he could not convince them, he
should have backed off to avoid alienating them.
Politics is about persuading people. Major succeeds in persuading us
only of his inadequacy, and that he is leader of a Government decimated
by sleaze whose remaining members have not the decency to resign for
their multiple errors of moral judgment.
He himself has the decency of a blind man stumbling from pot-hole to
pot-hole but without the insight to realise that his problems (and the
nation's) will only be resolved when he gets out of the way.

THE hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni people in Nigeria
is not the end of the campaign of human rights in that country, nor is
it something you can do nothing about.
The plight of the Ogoni people has been affected by the attitude of
multi-national companies who operate in Nigeria and who benefit from
collusion with its military government. The actions of Shell in the
Niger river delta immediately spring to mind and there are others (the
British armaments industry for one). Immediately we should all support
the boycott of Shell in our own country. Shell is guilty with other
foreign oil companies of turning the lush Niger delta into a wasteland.
This boycott should have been implemented in 1990 when the Ogoni
people held a peaceful protest against the rape of their land by Shell.
This protest prompted Shell to call on the Nigerian military for
strong-arm support to prevent the reoccurrence of what was a peaceful
affair.
It's pointless asking the Tory Government for any action on this
matter as it is at the beck and call of the United States which is
Nigeria's biggest oil customers and already suffers from having imposed
sanctions against Iran, Iraq, and Libya anyway.
If the death of nine people guilty only of asking for an end to the
rape of their land and its natural resources fails to move our so-called
elected leaders, then it's time for people to take things into their own
hands and the Shell boycott can start the process.

I WRITE to support Colin Campbell's protest at the Church of
Scotland's Board of World Mission proposal to sell off the Scots in
Paris and put the proceeds into the kitty at 121 George Street,
Edinburgh.
As one of the thousands of Scots who helped to raise the funds to
rebuild this famous and historic place of worship after the war, I
regard this as a scandal not merely because it is a symbol of the Auld
Alliance but also to the memory of two heroic Scots who were associated
with the Scots Kirk.
The story of Donald Caskie is well known but the story of the heroism
of Netta Campbell Mackintosh who had a lifetime's association with the
Kirk in the Rue Bayard is largely forgotten. A daughter of a Crieff
family, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre with Star by General de
Gaulle for her heroism.
For several years she hid escaping prisoners of war in her flat in
Paris, mainly Canadians, and when finally betrayed, she also served a
term of imprisonment in Fresnes, north of Paris.
I would hope that once again a fund would be set up to save the Scots
Kirk and keep this quiet place in the heart of Paris for generations of
Scottish visitors and for Scots resident in the capital of France.
''Where there is no vision, the people perish'' -- and so will the
Church of Scotland.

THE one thing I was at pains not to do was to make a ''call to ban
hunt on National Trust land'' (November 10).
As the council member whose resolution in February led to the
withdrawal of consent to hunting at the trust's Hill of Tarvit estate, I
specifically stated that my standpoint was not that of someone who is
opposed to fox-hunting. I wanted the trust to move from its
controversial and increasingly untenable pro-hunting stance to one of
disengagement and neutrality.
The position of neutrality, which was overwhlemingly endorsed by the
membership at the AGM last April, has now been departed from as a result
of intense pressure from the pro-hunt lobby.
The trust's policy of open access will make Hill of Tarvit an easy
target for anti-hunt demonstrators as the aggravated trespass laws will
not be applicable. As a consequence I predict not only chaos at Hill of
Tarvit but an early demise for hunting as a legal activity in Scotland.

Washington
THE US government has stopped all non-essential activities today after
President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress failed to break a
budget deadlock blocking further funding of federal operations.
''Our government shutdown is now underway,'' White House spokesman
Mike McCurry said shortly after Budget Director Alice Rivlin ordered
federal departments and agencies to begin shutting their doors.
About 800,000 out of some 2.3 million federal civilian employees
turned up for work, from Washington to Los Angeles -- and were sent
home. The rest were deemed ''essential workers'' and stayed on the job.
President Clinton appeared on television this afternoon to blame
Congress for the shut-down, because it tried to impose ''sharp hikes in
Medicare premiums and deep cuts in education and the environment''.
He liked the phrase so well that he used it seven times in a
three-minute speech. He delivered it after administration officials and
congressional leaders had met, in Congress, without resolving their
differences.
The armed forces continue to operate, the Bosnia peace talks in Dayton
are not interrupted, the FBI pursues the bad guys, and cheques for
pensioners are still processed and sent out, air traffic controllers are
still working, and customs and immigration officials still deal with
people arriving here. In theory, of course, there is no money for any of
these essential purposes, but this is ritual and everyone has agreed
that the government is not breaking the law by providing these services.
Equally symbolic, the museums, monuments and national parks have been
closed. The magnificent Vermeer exhibition opened at the National
Gallery on Sunday, and closed today. The cafeteria at the House of
Representatives has been privatised, so it is still open. The one in the
Senate hasn't, so it isn't. Two-thirds of the White House staff has been
sent home, but most of the staffs at Congress are deemed essential, so
stay on the job.
The Post Office is a profit-making enterprise, so it continues
uninterrupted. The city of Washington, on the other hand, depends on
federal payments, and half of it closed today. There will be no official
garbage collection, but since half the city has gone over to private
collectors, in despair at official incompetence, that will not make much
difference.
All this because of the dispute between the Democratic president,
elected three years ago, and the Republican Congress, elected 12 months
ago. Congress is determined to balance the budget by 2002, and has firm
ideas on how to do so, while the president is doubtful that it can be
done so rapidly and is quite sure he disagrees with the Republicans'
methods.
Yesterday evening he vetoed a Congressional resolution that would have
allowed the government to continue until the 1996 budget is voted, on
the grounds that it imposed too many unacceptable conditions. ''If
America must close down access to quality education, a clean environment
and affordable health care for our seniors, in order to keep the
government open, then the price is too high,'' he said,
Earlier in the day, he had vetoed another bill that extended the
national debt, also on the grounds that irrelevant addenda to the bill
made it unacceptable.
Later in the evening, he summoned the leaders of both parties to the
White House for a last-minute effort to avert the shut-down.
Congress remained in session, just in case the leaders could settle
their differences. To no avail.
The Republican side insisted that the president must accept their
terms for balancing the budget by 2002. ''Everything else is
ancillary,'' said the chairman of the appropriations committee in the
House, Bob Livingstone, one of the senior Republican leaders.
Mr Clinton offered to sign the two bills if Congress would strip them
of all their additional provisions, leaving them ''clean'' -- meaning
concerned just with financing the government and extending the debt
ceiling.
The moderate chairman of the Senate finance committee, Pete Dominici,
said: ''That's out of the question.''
The meeting lasted nearly two hours and ended just before midnight.
The speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, said that the talks had been
useful and clear, but nothing was agreed.
After the president made his statement this afternoon, and the
Republicans responded, the negotiators resumed work. The shut-down, and
the statements, are all theatre and the curtain has to be rung down one
day.

WE are promised a tearjerker next Monday when the Princess of Wales
steps into the searching spotlight of the BBC's Panorama programme for
her first solo television interview. But will we be crying for the
Princess and her fractured marriage or the monarchy itself?
It took a long time for the dust to settle last year after Prince
Charles appeared on ITV and admitted being unfaithful to his wife. In
that interview the prince told Jonathan Dimbleby he had ''no regrets''
about the admission and went on to answer questions about his friendship
with Camilla Parker Bowles. ''At some point after that it was obvious
that she was going to use television to retaliate,'' said one court
insider yesterday.
The news that Panorama reporter Martin Bashir has recorded a
wide-ranging and in-depth interview with the princess, covering many
aspects of her private life and relations with her estranged husband,
took everyone by surprise yesterday, including the rest of the royal
family. While Diana coolly swanned off to chat with patients at
Broadmoor, Buckingham Palace was hastily contacting Charles, celebrating
his 47th birthday with a boisterous walkabout in Berlin.
The BBC is stoking interest in the interview by revealing no further
details in advance, other than that it covers ''every stage of her life
as the Princess of Wales, including her family, her separation, and her
future plans''. There will be none of the customary previews. However,
this latest bombshell is likely to add weight to the arguments of those
who depict the princess as a petulant scheming manipulator, rather than
the gullible innocent of popular mythology.
It also finally puts paid to any notion that she wishes to avoid
public scrutiny. It's almost exactly two years since the princess
announced her withdrawal from public life and asked to be allowed to
live away from the media spotlight.
Since then she has rarely been out of it and has sometimes appeared to
court it. The broadcast will coincide with Diana's preparations for her
high-profile working visit to Argentina, which appears to be being used
by the British Government to smooth the path to reconciliation with our
former enemies from the Falklands war.
By yesterday afternoon the princess was being accused of endangering
the future of the royal family by trying to turn them into a soap opera.
Harold Brooks-Baker, the editor of the aristocratic directory, Burke's
Peerage, said: ''I think it will be another nail in the coffin of the
monarchy. Just when things were beginning to get more civilised, a
little more grown-up. Just when the Prince of Wales was beginning to
slowly win more public understanding.
''Anything that dents that public understanding means that the future
constitutional position of the Prince of Wales is put in danger.''
Mr Brooks-Baker said he doubted that the programme would do anything
to bolster-up the royals. The prince had talked about the Government and
the Commonwealth in the Dimbleby documentary, but the princess had
''chosen a soap-opera approach'' in her life and ''seems determined to
upset'' the sensitive position her husband was in, he said.
''There are members of the Commonwealth who are beginning to feel that
the royal family is a little trivial.'' He added: ''If the programme is
full of tears -- and I believe it will be a real tearjerker -- it will
put the future of the monarchy and the Commonwealth in danger.
''The princess is constantly bringing her private life into public,
which is titillating for people who write gossip columns, but not for
other people.''
Although this is the first time the princess has ever given a
first-hand account of her side of the story, she has frequently made
comments through ''friends'' or in speeches at charity dinners. The
clearest insight into her troubled life up to now has been given by
author Andrew Morton whose book, Diana: Her True Story, published in
1992, disclosed her problems with bulimia, alleged suicide attempts and
her distress at the prince's relationship with Mrs Parker Bowles.
However, in recent months Charles appears to have been winning the
media war for the hearts and minds of the British people. Although
coverage of the Dimbleby interview focused on the confession of
infidelity, the programme also contained much positive material,
including footage of the Prince of Wales enjoying the outdoor life with
the couple's sons, Princes William and Harry. Some sources claim Diana
has been desperate to counter or at least match this sort of coverage.
It's all a very long way from the world's first glimpses of the gawky,
blushing 19-year-old Diana in 1981, when the couple announced their
engagement. To discover whether today's older Diana is also a wiser one,
we will have to join the estimated ten million viewers likely to tune to
BBC1 at 9.40pm next Monday.
HOW THE FAIRY TALE TURNED TO FAILURE
* 1981 -- In February Buckingham Palace announces the prince's
engagement to 19-year-old Lady Diana Spencer. The couple marry on July
29 at St Paul's Cathedral.
* 1982 -- Prince William is born in June. Charles, away from the
public gaze while Diana basks in public affection, resents her skill at
enchanting ordinary people. Their interests take them in different
directions, and Diana has little time for Charles's philosophic
wanderings.
* 1984 -- Prince Harry is born in September.
* 1987 -- A rift in the marriage becomes increasingly obvious,
prompting furious media speculation about a possible split.
* 1991 -- Relations are said to be so cool between Charles and Diana
that they are reported to have separate rooms during a state visit to
Czechoslovakia.
* 1992 -- Andrew Morton's book Diana: Her True Story, is published in
June. In December, the Prime Minister announces to a packed House of
Commons that the couple have agreed to separate.
* 1993 -- In March an Australian TV company broadcast fresh extracts
from the Squidgygate tapes, alleging that the relationship between Diana
and Gilbey was much more intimate than previously claimed.
* 1994 -- In June Charles admits to Jonathan Dimbleby, in a television
documentary, that he has been unfaithful to his wife. He says he has no
''regrets'' about the admission and believes he will still be crowned
King.
* 1995 -- In August, Diana is linked with another man, England Rugby
captain Will Carling, after they become friends while training at an
exclusive gym in Chelsea, west London, and Mr Carling visits her at
Kensington Palace.

SARA VILLIERS translates the lonely hearts' lingo
LONELY hearts the world over may be comforted with the thought that
there are plenty of fish in the sea, but how the heck do you hook them?
In the sixteenth century you spun them lyrical lines, as John Donne did
in his poem The Bait; ''Come live with me and be my love/ And we will
some new pleasures prove/ Of golden sands and crystal brooks/ With
silken lines, and silver hooks.''
Catching a lover in the nineties is a more cryptic affair. Poetry is
sadly lacking in the language of love in the nineties. You don't sigh
over it. You try to crack the code. A typical example would be: ''Size
12 vgl blonde with gsoh looking for fs swm for tlc, alawp.''
It might sound like instructions for a computer programme but it's
actually the vocabulary of the lonely hearts columns where longing for
love is expressed through the curtest of abbreviations and where
personal CVs are reduced to the lowest common denominators, with women
drawing attention to their looks and men boasting of their financial
muscle.
Top of the abbreviation list is gsoh -- good sense of humour. It's
surely an overrated quality -- you might fancy a lover with a gift of
the gab but one with a gift for the gag would surely be wearisome --
but, surprisingly, it seems to be a priority for male and female
advertisers. The majority insist that they have it, some taking pains to
stand out from the masses, emphasising extra conviviality with vgsoh.
And while it seems a trifle immodest to point out that you are vgl --
very good looking, or very good lover as it is sometimes optimistically
misinterpreted as -- just how vain do you have to be to point out that
you are gvgl -- genuinely very good looking -- as a hopeful heart did in
Time Out, the London's listing magazine, recently? A superficial
description like that might sound like a horrendous dose of narcissism
but apparently such blatant ploys do the trick. In a busy marketplace
you have to strut your wares.
Tracey Dale, who is in charge of the Lonely Hearts pages in Time Out
reckons that the ads which get the most replies are the most immodest --
especially with regards to female advertisers. Pitch yourself as blonde
and beautiful, and eager replies will come in sackloads.
Men tend to market themselves as fs -- financially secure -- although
you don't have to be Einstein to figure out that anyone who is trying to
save the #1 a word that this shorthand allows doesn't have a great deal
of cash to spare.
Dale tries to talk men out of bleating on about their incomes. ''I
don't really think that most women are terribly preoccupied with that,
but guys reckon that they are. I think that's quite sad but men are
convinced that if they don't say that they are financially sound then
they won't get any replies.''
They probably have a point. Interestingly, men who don't explain that
they have a gsoh but attempt to demonstrate it with wacky ads, eg,
''Short Greying Dribbles, that's my Dachshund X terrier, who does the
salsa with me in front of a mirror, but much prefer female, non-canine,
partner'' usually get short shrift. ''The funny advertisements are
pretty risky,'' says Dale. ''They're very hit or miss. They either get a
lot of replies or none at all.''
Men do tend to put a little bit more imagination into the wording of
their ads. They have to. There are far more single men in Britain than
single women, and as men get older it gets more difficult for them to
find Miss Right. Glancing at the personals that's obviously a situation
which some men are having a lot of trouble getting to grips with.
The majority of forty to fiftysomething males have no qualms about
admitting they are looking for a woman 10 years younger -- obviously
hopeful that Miss Young Thing won't have any children packed into her
personal baggage. The self-conceit can be astonishing. For every guy
announcing that he doesn't mind kids, are 10 warning ''no fatties
please.''
Apparently, the ads which guarantee most replies are those which
combine the regular ploys alongside a quirky feature. Dale has noted
that women are always impressed by an unusual job, be it river widener
or orchestral conductor.
''The only potential problem with that is that men who mention that
they are a director or musician tend to get swamped by replies from
actresses or singers looking for work.''
But whether the ads are from soppy romantics looking for tlc -- tender
loving care, or someone pursuing f 'n' f -- fun 'n' frolics, which hints
at something a lot more sleazy than it sounds, they invariably conclude
with a standard parting shot of alawp -- all letters answered with

POVERTY and deprivation could be the cause of a reported #1m overspend
on prescribed drugs by Fife Health Board, the leader of the new Fife
Council claimed yesterday.
Calling for a detailed study into the deficit, Councillor Alex Rowley
said: ''This overspend and other ways in which the NHS budget is being
overstretched in Fife could be a cry for help from people within our
communities who are suffering the effects of unemployment, low pay and
social deprivation.''
Mr Rowley stressed such an inquiry would enable voluntary groups, the
council and Fife Health Board to work together to address important
issues.
The leader of the new administration said he was alarmed that health
board managers had admitted the reasons for the overspend were not fully
understood.
''The theory that there is a clear link between disadvantage, poverty
and the increasing demand on health services should be tested.''
The councillor claimed studies had already shown the development of
children could be impaired by living conditions.

TORY-CONTROLLED Berwickshire District Council yesterday became the
first Scottish local authority to complete the hand-over of its housing
stock to a local housing association.
Speaking in Coldstream, Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson
described the move as ''a significant milestone''.
The Minister also said that he hoped many more councils would follow
Berwickshire's example and consider the benefits of pursuing a policy of
stock transfers.
Local government reorganisation provides councils with an ideal
opportunity to reassess their role in relation to housing, he claimed.
The transfers could bring other benefits for tenants, such as rent
guarantees and the potential for greater involvement in the management
of their homes, he added.
Also speaking at the formal ceremony to mark the completion of the
transfer, Mr Peter McKinlay, Scottish Homes's chief executive, said
tenants in Berwickshire had voted overwhelmingly to take advantage of
the benefits such changes could bring.
He referred to the opposition of some tenants' groups to Scottish
Homes' handling of its own stock transfers.
Mr McKinlay said he hoped in future the debate would centre on
opportunities the transfers offered for generating new housing
investment and improvement.
Mr McKinlay also said that Scottish Homes was on target to attract
more than #50m this year by transferring some 7500 of its properties to
alternative landlords.
Berwickshire District Council, which will disappear after local
government reorganisation, has transferred just over 2000 houses to the
Berwickshire Housing Association at Coldstream.

<TEXT>
A RESEARCHER told a fatal accident inquiry yesterday that patients who
had undergone experimental hip replacement treatment had reported pain
from the procedure.
Miss Fiona French, 41, worked with consultant Dr Srimathi Murali to
see if the incidence of elderly women suffering a second hip fracture
could be reduced through the injection of a ceramic paste into the bone
to strengthen it.
She was giving evidence at the inquiry in Aberdeen into the death of
Mrs Phyllis Moffitt, 70, of Inchmarlo, near Banchory, who died of a
heart attack after being given a sedative to ease discomfort during the
operation last year.
Miss French signed up elderly women who had previously suffered a hip
fracture for the new treatment and made follow-up calls in the course of
which, she claimed, a number of patients reported having suffered pain.
Mrs Moffitt was the sixteenth patient, she said.
''When I contacted prospective patients and they asked me if the
treatment would be painful, I could not tell them it was not,'' Miss
French said.
The inquiry continues.

<TEXT>
A WOMAN who admitted leaving her three children at home unattended
while she flew off on holiday to Spain was jailed for one year
yesterday.
Liverpool Crown Court heard police had gone to her home in Kirkby,
Merseyside, after a tip-off and found her 12-year-old daughter had just
cooked chips for her brothers aged seven and five.
The 30-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty
to three child abandonment charges. She stood with her head bowed in the
dock while sentence was passed.
Judge William Wickham told her: ''What you did was a serious crime
against your children, putting your personal pleasure before their
welfare. You took a chance -- good mothers don't take such chances.
''I realise that sending you to prison will deprive your children of
the care that you are giving them at the moment.
''But if you are not punished for leaving your children, there will be
a widespread sense of outrage that justice has not been done . . . ''
Miss Elizabeth Cliff, prosecuting, said when officers went to the
woman's home at 4.30pm on Saturday, August 26, the 12-year-old girl told
them her mother had gone to Spain and said their father lived in the
Kirkby area.
The chip pan was still hot and the girl said she had just cooked chips
for the boys' tea, and the washing machine and tumbler dryer were
working.
One neighbour said the mother had left at 4am and she had seen the
girl painting the bathroom later that morning. The woman had taken the
two boys in to clean them up because they had soiled themselves.
A social worker was contacted.
Police got the children's aunt to look after them until the mother's
return from Spain a week later.
They tracked down the father of the youngest boy, whom all three
children called ''Dad'', and he confirmed that he had been asked to mind
them.
The woman was arrested at Manchester Airport when she flew in from
Alicante on September 2 and taken to Huyton Police Station for
questioning.
She claimed she had given the father #40 to mind the children, saying
she had not been abroad or flown before and had been looking forward to
the holiday and wanted to go.
When he did not arrive by 10pm the night before, she had left, she
went to look for him and had tried to get a friend to look after the
children.
''I thought he would turn up,'' she said.
She realised that her daughter would not be able to cope, and admitted
that she had ''taken a chance''.
Miss Cliff said the children had been placed on a social services ''at
risk'' register, but remained with their mother, and there were no plans
for further legal action.
The court heard that the woman had previous convictions for
shoplifting.
Miss Pamela Badley, defending, said: ''My submission is that these are
offences of inadequacy rather than wickedness.''
She described the woman as ''unsophisticated'' but ''a very determined
and loving mother of her children''.
She said the woman's father had paid for the holiday, and it was not
possible for the children to go.
A total of 10 members of the family had gone on the trip, which was
meant to help them all get over a bereavement.
Miss Badley said the woman had been under a great deal of family
pressure to go on the holiday. She had panicked when the father did not
arrive the evening before the flight, and asked a friend, who told her
point blank that she could not look after them.
''She never envisaged that the 12-year-old would be able to cope. This
is the evil for which she must be punished -- she did take a chance and
she accepts that.''

ISLANDERS are facing big price increases in Orkney shops after the
removal of a freight subsidy, it was claimed yesterday. A study into the
loss of the Scottish Office support also shows that companies and jobs
are being put at risk. The #8.3m subsidy on cargo shipped to and from
the Northern Isles ended six months ago.
Since then, consultants have monitored the effects on 12 Orkney
businesses. Orkney Enterprise chairman Eric Green said firms had seen
freight costs rise by between 2% and 57%. He said: ''The normal
inflation rate is running at around 3% but we are seeing shelf prices
going up by 8.4%.''

<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Water yesterdaytold a public inquiry it had done all it
could to prevent a drought crisis -- at the same time as a Government
Minister admitted the company could have handled the situation better.
At an inquiry into Yorkshire Water's application for an emergency
drought order, the company's director of production and technology, Mr
John Layfield, claimed it had recognised the possibility of severe
problems in June and had taken numerous steps to avoid a crisis.
They included increased leakage detection and repair, hosepipe bans,
and a massive tankering operation.
But, as Mr Layfield gave his evidence to the public inquiry in
Dewsbury, Environment Minister David Curry was in Huddersfield, meeting
business leaders, health experts, and representatives from Calderdale
and Kirklees who will be affected by the proposed cuts.
Later he told journalists: ''I think Yorkshire Water should, in the
early stages around July, have sat down and produced a more
comprehensive response so people could see that in front of them there
were a series of measures that could be taken.''
In the first of a series of objections to the 24-hour on, 24-hour off
cuts, the inquiry was told that they could lead to lives being lost.
West Yorkshire's director of public health, Dr Chris Worth, said there
would be a much higher risk of illness -- including dysentery and
salmonella -- if water was cut off.
Mr Guy Cocker, the chairman of Calderdale's dental committee, said the
104 surgeries in Calderdale and Kirklees might not be able to open.
He added: ''Cuts would mean a return to the dental pain and suffering
of the last century. It is potentially devastating.''
About 250 residents and businesses have objected to the proposals, but
only 32 elected to speak at the inquiry, which is expected to finish
tomorrow.
Earlier, Yorkshire Water announced a package of compensation payments
to be made if the cuts are introduced. Customers will receive an average
of #9.50 a week.

CONVENTION of Scottish Local Authorities president Rosemary McKenna
appealed yesterday for a new consistency and stability in the
relationship between central and local government.
She was speaking after a series of fierce attacks by Scottish Office
Ministers on the new unitary councils over their staffing levels and
internal structures.
Several councils were accused of employing too many highly-paid
officials and setting up top-heavy committee structures.
Mrs McKenna, in turn, accused Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and
Local Government Minister George Kynoch of ''inconsistency'' in their
approach.
Addressing a conference organised by Cosla and Scottish Education for
Action and Development, she said that, during the passage of the
reorganisation Bill, the Government had consistently argued that
councils should have the freedom to determine their own structures.
That policy had been strongly supported by former Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang and the-then Local Government Minister Allan Stewart, but had
suddenly changed since the new team took over at the Scottish Office.
''Local government has the right to expect Government to behave in a
consistent manner in terms of what is a matter for local government and
what is a matter for central government. That policy should not change
simply because of a change in the Secretary of State,'' she insisted.
There was a need to move away from the present ''unstable,
counter-productive'' relationship, Mrs McKenna said.
Local government needed to know where it stood and where it was
appropriate for central government to regulate and where it was not.
The Cosla president also called for the creation of a stable financial
environment for local government within which the Government's capping
powers should be ended.

<TEXT>
A WOMAN who went to the doctor with backache was left reeling after he
told her she was in labour.
Hours later, un-expectant mother Amanda Galloway was in hospital
clutching her newborn baby.
Ms Galloway, 23, who lives with boyfriend Neil Beasley in Kitts Green,
Birmingham said: ''I had no symptoms at all, and felt fit and well
throughout the whole nine months.
''I had terrible backache which was so bad Neil took me to the
doctor's. After examining me, the doctor told us I was pregnant and
having labour pains -- I couldn't believe it.''
She was taken to the Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, where she
underwent the tests and scans she should have had throughout her
pregnancy to ensure the baby was healthy.
She went into labour and five hours later gave birth to an 8lb 11oz
boy, whom she and Mr Beasley have named Ryan.
Mr Harry Gee, consultant obstetrician at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth
Hospital, said yesterday that although it was extremely rare, it was
possible for a woman to go through a pregnancy without realising her
condition.
Ms Galloway, said: ''When I got to the hospital the midwives couldn't
believe I hadn't known I was pregnant and kept asking me whether I had
felt the baby move, but I hadn't at all.
''I did notice I had put on a few pounds, but because I had recently
started a new job working 9.30am to 10pm shifts I put that down to
eating at irregular times and late at night.''

BUSINESSMAN Kevin Maxwell wept when he heard his father's body had
been found, his wife told the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mrs Pandora Maxwell said in the months before tycoon Mr Robert
Maxwell's death, her husband's relationship with his father had been
strained, and he had made plans to leave the business.
But news that his father had gone missing from his yacht had left him
very upset.
''He came home late that evening. He said a body had been found and he
broke down and wept. It was the only time he did,'' she said.
Mr Robert Maxwell's widow, Elizabeth, told the court how she searched
in vain to find a note from her husband when she went on board his yacht
the night he died.
''At the time I really did think it was an accidental death, but I
wondered also whether there was anything more sinister,'' she said.
''I looked throughout the cabin and I also looked through his papers,
but I could find nothing. About 5am, totally exhausted, I went to bed.''
She said her son, Kevin, had telephoned her about 11pm that night and
asked her to send back all his father's business papers with a pilot who
would be arriving the next day.
He asked her to look specifically for a share certificate relating to
the Israeli company Teva, which she found and sent back with the rest of
the papers.
Mr Maxwell, 36, of Oxfordshire, his brother, Ian, 38, of Westminster,
and former financial adviser Mr Larry Trachtenberg, 42, of
Hertfordshire, deny conspiring to defraud a pension fund by misusing
#22m worth of Teva shares.
Mr Maxwell also denies a similar charge relating to Scitex shares.
Israeli pathologist Dr Judaha Hiss, who carried out the autopsy on Mr
Robert Maxwell's body, said it was unlikely he had committed suicide.
''It's more likely that he fell involuntarily into the sea either as a
result of an accident or homicide,'' he said in evidence read to the
court.
He said Mr Robert Maxwell's left shoulder muscle had been subjected to
''extraordinary and considerable strain''.
It was most likely that his whole body had been suspended from or
forced on to his left hand for a number of seconds, but the evidence
suggested he had not been in the sea when this happened.
Dr Jane Ward, physiology lecturer at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals,
said it was possible he might have fainted while relieving himself over
the side.
''If he did get up to pass water over the side of the boat in the
middle of the night, he would certainly have exposed himself to the risk
of passing out, and therefore have put himself in considerable danger,''
she said in written evidence.

PROFESSOR Robert Black, QC, who produced a report which claimed that
68 relatives of Monklands councillors were employed by the council,
accepted at a Government inquiry yesterday that he had not checked with
the people or the councillors whether this was true.
It was Professor Black's report in June which indirectly led to the
Scottish Office announcing a statutory inquiry into staff appointments
at the Lanarkshire council.
Newspapers reported, in what became known as the ''jobs for the boys''
scandal, that the Black report had confirmed widespread nepotism at
Monklands.
However Professor Black, a professor of law at Edinburgh University,
described his report as ''somewhat bland'' and said press reports at the
time were inaccurate when they reported he had discovered nepotism --
favouritism to relatives.
Mr William Nimmo Smith, QC, who is conducting the inquiry, asked about
a story in the Scotsman which described his report as finding damning
evidence of nepotism. ''I have to disagree. There is no such evidence,''
said Professor Black.
He added the verdict would have to be ''not proven, or indeed, no case
to answer.''
He also confirmed that, although his report listed 68 relatives of
councillors, no direct check had been made on this.
Mr Nimmo Smith told Professor Black that his own team had written to
those concerned and discovered only 48 were related to councillors, and
some of more tenuously than had been put in the Black report. One person
described as a nephew, for example, turned out to be the son of the
councillor's father's cousin.
Professor Black explained that he had carried out his inquiry at the
request of Monklands District Council itself. He and his clerk set up an
office at Coatbridge Town Hall and advertised for people who had any
information to contact them. He drew up the list of councillors'
relatives if the names were corroborated by at least two informants.
Many of those who turned out not to be relatives had the same surname
as councillors, the inquiry heard yesterday.
The reason why the veracity of the relationships was not checked was
pursued by Mr Nimmo Smith, who said it seemed to him that one obvious
way to investigate the allegations would be to ask the people named.
Professor Black replied that there were certain difficulites in that
he had no powers to compel people to give evidence to him, nor did he
have any immunity from prosecution for defamation.
Some of the information Professor Black received came from meeting
people in pubs, hotels and at their homes. Some people, he said, did not
want to go to the town hall, and others were sceptical about the
telephone lines to the office and security at the town hall office.
Allegations that people benefited from their relationships with
councillors, or from being members of the Labour Party, were made to the
inquiry by Labour regional councillor, Mr John Murphy. A former
caretaker with the council, he stated that housing department staff
regularly complained to him, as a shop steward, that people were
appointed to jobs without the jobs being advertised.
He claimed that two relatives of councillors were promoted when it was
his view that they did not have the managerial qualifications needed.
He also told of an employee who told him that his job had been
arranged by a councillor.
People had also told him, Councillor Murphy claimed, that if you had
an association with the Labour Party, it was advantageous when applying
for a job.
Mr Nimmo Smith tried to press him on whether he had any evidence of
his claims, and Mr Murphy replied that he knew a number of people who
were employed by the council who were Labour Party members. Mr Nimmo
Smith observed he would be ''perfectly astonished'' if there were not
Labour Party members among Monklands staff.
So far, few facts have emerged at the inquiry, but it is known that 28
of the relatives of councillors have been contacted about possibly
giving evidence.
Mr Nimmo Smith has also taken a sample of 80 Monklands council
employees to the Labour Party. The party confirmed that 10 of them were
party members. Three were members before joining the council, and seven
joined after their appointments.
His inquiry team has also gone through the notes kept by Professor
Black's clerk, and has attempted to contact the informants where
possible -- one has used a pseudonym. No-one has written back to offer
to give evidence in public.
Mr Nimmo Smith has the power to compel witnesses to attend, but is not
of a mind to do so unless he believes they can give direct evidence
rather than what he calls ''inferential assertions''.
The public taking of evidence is expected to take three weeks, with
the area's two Labour MPs being called tomorrow. Some councillors will
also give evidence.
Mr Nimmo Smith hopes to deliver his report to the Secretary of State
by the end of the year.

NINETEEN grants to Glasgow artists and organisations -- designed to
bring a visually festive atmosphere to the city next year -- were
announced yesterday.
The awards, equally funded by Glasgow District Council and the
Scottish Arts Council, are for diverse projects and exhibitions during
the city's Festival of Visual Arts 1996. Applications to the #100,000
fund were invited in May and 82 were received.
The three ''flagship'' events of the festival will be the opening of
the Gallery of Modern Art in Royal Exchange Square in March, a Charles
Rennie Mackintosh exhibition in the McLellan Galleries from May, and a
Festival of Design in October, but it was recognised yesterday that the
creation of a year-round festival was down to local artists, and that
much was being expected from a comparatively small sum of money.
District council principal grants officer Pamela McMahon said: ''This
is a modest but significant part of the festival because it is created
by the artistic community itself. This is the starting point, and it is
over to the artists to make sure that our trust in these projects is
justified.''
She estimated that it would have required #500,000 to fund all of the
projects which had come to the 1996 fund for support, but suggested that
some of the others may go ahead with support from other sources.
Council leader Pat Lally described the grants, averaging #5000, as
''an acknowledgement and celebration of the artistic strength of the
city''.
The largest of the awards announced yesterday is to Peter McCaughey
and Stephen Skrynka, who plan -- in association with Independent Public
Arts Ltd -- to make street art at 30 sites in the city, using glass
pavement lights that were originally designed to allow light into
basement areas. The #15,000 grant meets much of the cost of the project.
A grant of #12,000 was awarded to Kenny Munro and Maurice Maguire for
Sourcing the Clyde, a project that will take the pair on a journey down
the river, working with community groups and building a neon scuplture
which will be installed in Glasgow city centre.
Another show, Iron, by Tom McKendrick, will look at the shipbuilding
history of the Clyde. Incorporating music and light as well as sculpture
and painting, the installation -- at the Collins Gallery -- will be a
tongue-in-cheek look at the misty-eyed vision of the city's industrial
past.

A MARATHON Old Bailey VAT fraud trial which has cost the taxpayer #6m
ended yesterday with all seven defendants being acquitted.
The jury, which was reduced to just nine members because one was
arrested for fraud, another fell ill, and a third discovered he knew
someone in the case, spent the night in a hotel before reaching its
unanimous verdicts.
The trial began in February and had been due to last three months --
but ended up going on for three times as long.
Mr Stewart Lawson-Rogers, prosecuting on behalf of Customs and Excise,
had alleged that Mr Robert Howes, a businessman, avoided paying #3m in
VAT by selling gold smuggled into the country in specially modified
waistcoats.
The gold was then melted down to make it seem like scrap gold from old
jewellery, and when it was sold on Howes avoided paying the VAT, he
alleged.
The other six defendants -- all partners or company directors -- had
been accused of helping Howes produce fake documentation.

EDINBURGH'S Temple of Tyre, built as part of the capital's failed bid
to beome Britain's City of Architecture and Design in 1999, was the
centre of a political row last night.
Months after it was demolished and the title lost to Glasgow, it was
disclosed that the outdoor sculpture, created from ship's containers and
rubber tyres by sculptor David Mach, had run up a bill four times the
original estimate.
A report by Edinburgh District Council's chief executive revealed that
the cost spiralled to #160,000, only a quarter of which was covered by
sponsorship.
Last night, Councillor Daphne Sleigh, leader of the Conservative
group, insisted that ruling Labour councillors should shoulder the
blame.
However, Labour group chairman Councillor Ian Perry said: ''If
councillors are to blame, then members of all the parties are
involved.''
The sculpture was originally to have been erected close to Heathrow,
for #40,000 of council money plus contributions from sponsors, but it
was decided later to site it in Leith.

A PUBLICAN was shot in the back after barring a man for stealing
toilet rolls, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Gerard Duffy, 39, told the High Court in Glasgow how he was blasted
with a sawn-off shotgun.
He told how he faced Mr William McGeachin, 28, outside his Brig Tavern
pub in Easterhouse Road, Glasgow, in July.
Mr Duffy told Advocate-depute Alexander Bolland, QC, he had ordered
one of Mr McGeachin's friends out of the pub for stealing two toilet
rolls.
He said: ''McGeachin produced a sawn-off double barrelled shotgun and
pointed it at me. He was only 5ft away.
''A barmaid looked out of the pub door and said: 'It's a bit heavy for
nothing'.''
Mr Duffy continued: ''I told him: 'Here's the police coming'. But
McGeachin just said: 'they'll get it as well'.'' One of McGeachin's
friends allegedly said: ''Leave it out. He's one of the boys.''
Mr Duffy said that as he turned to go back inside the pub he was shot
in the back.
He was taken to the Glasgow Royal Infimary and later transferred to
Canniesburn Hospital, where a muscle was taken from his back and
transplanted into his arm.
Mr Duffy said he might not regain the full use of his right arm and
hand for two years.
Mr McGeachin, described as a prisoner at Barlinnie, denies attempting
to murder Mr Duffy by shooting him.
The trial continues.

THE company that owns the copyright to Enid Blyton's classic
children's stories -- including The Famous Five series and Noddy -- has
been put on the market.
Darrell Waters Ltd, which owns copyright on 700 Blyton titles, will be
sold in time for her centenary in 1997.
The copyrights are estimated to be worth around #10m.
The majority of Darrell Waters shares are owned by the author's
descendants, including her two daughters, granddaughters and
stepchildren.
Blyton was the sixth most borrowed author from UK libraries in 1994,
her books have been translated into more than 30 languages and around
8.5 million are sold annually worldwide.
Price Waterhouse, which is managing the sale, said: ''Blyton's
reputation is enjoying a worldwide revival, not only in book form, but
lucrative film and television as well.''
The BBC has scored an international success with its animation of
Noddy, and merchandising brought in #42m worldwide last year.

Wardell concocted ''an elaborate scheme quite literally to get away
with murder,'' Richard Wakerley, QC, told the jury
THE HUSBAND of a building society manageress beat, trussed and gagged
himself after suffocating his wife to make it appear she had been killed
during a robbery which had gone wrong, a jury heard yesterday.
Mr Gordon Wardell, 42, a car component executive, of Meriden,
Warwickshire, denies murdering his 39-year-old wife, Carol, at their
home in September of last year.
Oxford Crown Court heard that bearded and bespectacled Wardell killed
the Woolwich manageress before dumping her body and stealing cash from
the branch where she worked, to make it seem she had lost her life in a
raid.
Mr Richard Wakerley, QC, told the jury that Mr Wardell concocted ''an
elaborate scheme quite literally to get away with murder''.
The jury was told that Mrs Wardell, keyholder to the Nuneaton branch
of the Woolwich, was asphyxiated at the couple's house before her
husband launched his scheme to ''deceive and divert suspicion from
himself''.
Mrs Wardell's body was found in a lay-by two miles from Nuneaton by a
motorist on his way to work at on Monday, September 12.
No attempt had been made to conceal the body. She was fully clothed,
but one sandal was missing from her right foot.
Later that morning, the apparent raid on the building society was
discovered.
No signs of forced entry were found and the alarms did not sound, but
cash was missing from the safe. Mrs Wardell's personal security code had
been used to open the vault at 5am that day.
The manageress's other sandal was found on the building society floor.
At 2pm the same day armed police surrounded the couple's home and
discovered Mr Wardell bound on the lounge floor.
Mr Wakerley said: ''It was a remarkable sight. He was on the floor,
lying on his back in the middle of the room, dressed only in his
underpants. His clothes and shoes were close by.
''He was apparently gagged with a strip of cloth and was tied to a
refuse sack holder with two ratchet ties around his wrists. He was
conscious and alert, but apparently had some bruising on his stomach.''
Mr Wardell told police and ambulance staff he had come home from a
drink at a local pub just before 10pm on Sunday to find men in his
house.
He said they knocked him unconscious and he had not regained his
senses until the Monday morning.
Asked when he had last seen his wife, he said: ''Last night -- she
went off with those men that were here.''
Mr Wakerley said ambulance staff later said Wardell's blood pressure
was not high and his heart rate was steady, despite his reported ordeal
at the hands of the raiders.
He added: ''The prosecution say that that was all a sham. It was part
of a false scheme to induce the police to believe that Carol had been
killed by a gang of robbers after they took her under force to the
building society -- leaving him unconscious and trussed up.
''He was not attacked by any gang. He was not then rendered
unconscious and tied up. He tied and put the gag on himself. His bruises
were self-inflicted.
''We say he did that after he killed his wife and left her body in the
lay-by, After that he had been to the building society to fake the
robbery, and the scene at the house which confronted those police
officers was all part of the sham.''
During the two days after the discovery of his wife's body, Mr Wardell
had ''spoken at great length about what he claimed had happened to
him.''
The trial continues.

THERE was confusion last night over the fate of the Knoydart Estate
following the news that an offer had been accepted from the unknown
Kinloch Investment Company, a Scottish registered company whose
directors own other estates in the West Highlands.
However, the Surrey property developer Mr Philip Rhodes who sold the
estate to troubled jute company Titaghur in 1993 for #1.8m, insists that
the 17,500 acre estate cannot be sold until he has received nearly
#200,000, which he says he is still due from the original sale.
The asking price had been #1.5m. Speculation was rife yesterday that
the successful bidders were property developers from Cambridge, a Mr and
Mrs Topham. It was only later this proved to be without foundation.
The only thing that was certain was that the Knoydart Foundation,
which included the community association, conservation interests, and
neighbouring landowners West End impressario Cameron Macintosh and the
Delwart family, had not been successful.
It is understood that a bid lodged by an individual, thought to be Mr
Macintosh, on behalf of the foundation, was around #1m, several hundred
thousand pounds short of the latest bid.
Kinloch Investment is represented by Blairgowrie-based solicitors A &amp;
R Robertson &amp; Black whose Mr Alistair Hall told The Herald last night:
''The position is that the offer has been accepted in principle. I have
already heard from Mr Rhodes and I daresay we will be hearing from his
solicitors.''
As regards the identity of his clients, Mr Hall said: ''I can say Mr
Rhodes is not involved and neither are the Tophams, whoever they might
be.
''My clients are fairly ordinary people with a service background who
already have estates in the Highlands. They are Scottish and live in
Scotland, but didn't want to give their names in case they were
bothered, with all respect, by people like you. They will get on well
with the local community and will be sensitive to their views.''
Meanwhile, Mr Rhodes, who 10 years ago bought 58,000 acres of Knoydart
for #1.2m and subsequently broke it up for sale in separate parcels,
said: ''I have got inhibitions and arrestments on the land and the
shares, so no sale can go through until these are lifted. All in all
these amount to about #200,000. The purchasers will have to see proof of
title and that is when the difficulties will arise.''

HEALTH and safety officials were yesterday investigating a second
Daks-Simpson plant in West Lothian after 12 staff complained of
dizziness, nausea, and a rash.
The 350-strong workforce of mainly women at the Polbeth factory were
sent home early, only days after its sister plant in Larkhall,
Lanarkshire, was closed for several days after 40 workers were taken to
hospital complaining of breathlessness and nausea.
It is the third health scare at a clothing factory in Scotland in the
past week.
The West Lothian plant makes up men's trousers for Marks &amp; Spencer
from material handled by the 1700 workers at Larkhall.
The company's manufacturing director, Mr Tom McCallum, said the Health
and Safety Executive's investigation of the factory was to be conducted
overnight as a precautionary measure.
He said 12 of the 350-strong workforce had been seen by the company
doctor yesterday morning. Two were referred to their own doctors with
sore throats, while the others remained at work.
''During the afternoon, a further four were sent home. The workforce
became more concerned. We decided it was appropriate to send them home
early,'' said Mr McCallum.
The workers have been told to return to the factory at 7.30am today.
However, angry staff said they would be demanding assurances over
safety before returning to work and said they were convinced it was
linked to the incident at Larkhall.
Miss Donna Mungall, 18, of Polbeth, was one of the dozen who fell ill
yesterday morning.
''I came out in a rash and felt sick and dizzy. I felt like I was
going to faint.
''I'm not coming in tomorrow. When I know the place is safe, I'll go
back to work.
Workers, who would not be identified, claimed they had asked for the
West Lothian factory to be cleaned out on Monday after the problems in
Lanarkshire.
One said: ''We've been told we are only panicking about the situation,
but we're very concerned. The three or four pregnant women working in
there have been taken off their lines and segregated.
''We have been told it's some kind of virus, but we don't believe
them.''
Daks-Simpson managing director in Scotland, Mr Kevin Johnson,
emphasised that the Polbeth workforce had been ''stressed'' by media
coverage of the situation in Larkhall and of a similar situation at the
Delta Textiles factory in Lanark.
''We have sent counsellors to talk to them, to take tension out of the
situation and carry out investigations,'' he added.
He pledged the company would give ''whatever help is necessary'' at
the factory, but stressed he did not think there was a major problem in
West Lothian. ''At this stage, the number of people seeing the doctor is
no more than we would expect,'' he said.
Mr Johnson said the cause of the illness in Larkhall remained a
mystery.

Moscow
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin, looking well in his second public
appearance since suffering a mild heart attack, said today he was
holding the reins of power firmly and was recovering raqpidly.
''I am holding and controlling the wheel of this large boat which is
Russia and I have my finger on the pulse,'' Yeltsin declared before
meeting Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev in Moscow's Central
Clinical Hospital.
The 64-year-old Kremlin chief, relaxed and speaking clearly, dispelled
doubts about his health in a 10-minute interview shown on Russian
television.
''The recovery will be complete,'' he said. ''Of course, more time is
needed. The main thing is that each day is a half step forward.''
Yeltsin, wearing a dark business suit and tie, embraced Nazarbayev
before sitting down to his first talks with a foreign leader since being
rushed to hospital almost three weeks ago.
He was clearly in much better shape than in his last brief television
appearance, on November 3, when he looked feeble and slurred his words
as he sat in an armchair.

A MAN who pretended to be a policeman before robbing two women in
their eighties was jailed for five years yesterday.
Lord Marnoch pointed out that Thomas Munro had previously been jailed
for four years for assault with intent to rob. The judge added: ''Now
you have stooped to rob old ladies in their homes.''
Munro admitted assaulting and robbing his victims, who were 84 and 82,
on July 23 this year. He also pleaded guilty to four housebreakings on
the same day.
Mr Craig Scott, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh that
Munro, 33, called at the 84-year-old woman's home in Musselburgh, posing
as a policeman. He was carrying a walkie-talkie radio and pretended to
speak into it.
The woman was suspicious of him but he pushed her aside and entered
her bedroom, where he pushed her on to a bed.
While he was searching the house, the woman pressed her panic alarm.
Munro fled after grabbing her purse containing #9.
Later that day, Munro called at the 82-year-old woman's house in
Hawick. He told her he was investigating a break-in.
She told him she did not want him in her home, but he pushed her
backwards and came in. When the woman began to shout for help, Munro put
his hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. He searched the house
and got away with #22.
Mr Scott said that Munro and a co-accused, Lee Cairns, 20, then broke
into four houses in Hawick, but were caught after a neighbour raised the
alarm.
Mr Stephen MacGibbon, counsel for Munro, said his client was married
with eight children and had carried out the crimes to pay for his drugs
habit.
Lord Marnoch ordered Cairns to be detained for 12 months.

ITV yesterday launched a winter schedule which it hopes will boost its
growing number of younger viewers with a strong programme of drama,
comedy, and light entertainment.
Established ratings winners return to the screen, such as Band of
Gold, Kavanagh QC, A Touch of Frost, Peak Practice, Taggart, The Knock,
Sharpe, The Governor, and Doctor Finlay. Old favourites such as Cilla
Black, Des O'Connor, Michael Barrymore, Jeremy Beadle and Bruce Forsyth
all return for prime time shows.
Among the new dramas are Call Red, a seven-part series about a
helicopter emergency rescue team. Louise Lombard, Sean Pertwee, and John
Shrapnel appear in Bodyguards, a one-hour drama, and Paul McGann stars
in a feature film, The One That Got Away, based on the true story of an
SAS patrol dropped behind enemy lines in the Gulf War and codenamed
Bravo Two Zero.
Thief Takers, a drama about the Metropolitan Police robbery squad
which was piloted earlier this year, has been developed into an
eight-part series.
ITV's major movies are A Few Good Men, Bram Stoker's Dracula, The
Unforgiven and Single White Female.

SCOTTISH Arts Minister Lord Lindsay last night sought to play down a
row which had erupted earlier in the day when he pretended to drink from
a bottle of Buckfast wine during a visit to the Rab C Nesbitt set in
Glasgow.
The Minister's action, which was captured on film by press
photographers attending the event, drew a swift response from Monklands
East Labour MP Helen Liddell, who has been a vociferous campaigner
against the consumption of the tonic wine in the West of Scotland.
She accused Lord Lindsay of being ''totally out of touch'' with what
is happening to ordinary people in ordinary communities in the West of
Scotland.
''The problems associated with Buckfast are well documented,'' Mrs
Liddell said. ''For Lord Lindsay to mock people's concerns like this
shows a complete lack of understanding. Frankly, for a Government
Minister to indulge in free advertising which is causing so many
problems beggars belief.''
Mrs Liddell, who travelled to Buckfast Abbey in Devon last November
for talks with the monks who produce the tonic wine, said she planned to
write to the Minister to draw his attention to the problems caused by
the drink.
Lord Lindsay, who chatted to Gregor Fisher and Elaine C Smith, the
principal actors in the BBC Scotland comedy series, sought to play down
his actions in a statement issued last night.
He said he was ''disappointed'' that some of the photographs taken on
his visit to the film set had been used ''mischievously'' to imply that
he was encouraging people to drink Buckfast.
The Minister said: ''For the record the bottle was a theatrical prop
filled with non-alcoholic red grape juice and, no, I am not promoting
that as a beverage either.''
He went on: ''The truth was more prosaic. I was celebrating Scotland
as a film location which can offer film markets state of the art
production facilities and bring much needed jobs and income to this
country.''
Lord Lindsay said the Soundstage premises were exactly the kind of
film facility which Scotland needed to compete worldwide for film and
television projects, and added: ''This is a film success story. It
should not be upstaged by props.''

A JEALOUS love rival aged 67 murdered an 80-year-old manager, a court
was told yesterday.
Mr Warwick Batchelor, a Unilever manager, was stabbed repeatedly with
a sharpened screwdriver when he unwittingly became caught in a love
triangle, Lewes Crown Court heard.
Mr Edward Martin, now 68, of Burgess Hill, West Sussex, denies the
murder.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Batchelor, a grandfather, was killed
by Mr Martin in a premeditated attack because he believed the older man
was a threat in his attempts to woo divorcee Mrs June Cuxson, 52.
Prosecutor Desmond de Silva, QC, said: ''In this case we enter a world
of singles clubs for the not so young, of genteel tea-dances, simmering
jealousy, and violent death.''
Mr Martin was besotted with Mrs Cuxson but she did not return his love
and developed a close friendship with Mr Batchelor through a local
bridge club, the court was told.
Mrs Cuxson told the court she had met Mr Martin at a tea dance and
later got to know Mr Batchelor through the bridge club.
Mrs Cuxson said: ''I enjoyed going dancing with Mr Martin and his
sister Audrey. I always thought he liked me more than I liked him. I did
not feel attracted to him.''
But she admitted she had harboured very different feelings for Mr
Batchelor despite their age difference and they had planned to move in
together.
The couple's plans for the future ended when Mr Martin heard that Mr
Batchelor and Mrs Cuxson planned to go on a trip to France together.
Unable to contain his jealousy, he plotted to kill his rival, it was
alleged.
Mr Martin stalked Mr Batchelor and lay in wait for him to return home
on the night before the trip last August, the court heard.
After neighbours heard cries for help, police were called and Mr
Batchelor was found lifeless with multiple stab wounds.
The court heard that Mr Martin was later arrested 20 yards from Mr
Batchelor's flat at Crown Point House, Hassocks, West Sussex, when
police saw him trying to dump a bin-liner containing the weapon and
bloodstained clothes.
The trial continues.

A FATHER whose 21-year-old son died in a Fife hospital after
overdosing on heroin has made an appeal to young people to stay away
from drugs.
The ventilator keeping Mr Gary Cowan alive at Kirkcaldy's Victoria
Hospital was switched off at the weekend after consultation with his
parents.
Mr Derek Cowan, 48, who was praised by police for his courage in
making the appeal, said news of the overdose had come as a total shock
because his son was not an addict.
''He was fit, active, and had everything to live for,'' said Mr Cowan,
of Methil. He condemned drugs and those who supplied them as the
''scourge of the country''.
Mr Cowan called on other young people tempted to take them to think of
the consequences.
''I hope Gary's death will be a lesson to them to have second thoughts
about their mums and dads, and brothers and sisters.''
Fife police said they had begun inquiries to trace the source of the
heroin.
They believe the heroin which killed unemployed Mr Cowan may either
have come from a bad batch or been of high purity.
Since the recent jailing for 10 years of local drug dealer George
Rodden, they had launched Operation Aftermath to intensify the fight
against drugs in the region's Levenmouth area.
Uniformed officers and detectives have been targeting suppliers and
users, and Detective Sergeant Ian Hutton warned: ''We will be exercising
our powers of stop and search under the Misuse of Drugs Act.''
Since November 1, more than 30 alleged offences are said to have been
detected, with a range of drugs seized, including cannabis and ecstasy.
Police emphasised that the success of their campaign depended on help
from the public. A police drugs hotline has been set up on 0800 137121.

AN ARMED robber's girlfriend said yesterday she was ''shocked'' to be
arrested with him as they stepped off a cross-Channel ferry in July.
Miss Julie Bryce, 31, told the High Court in Edinburgh that she was
flown north separately from Brian Martin and detained overnight at
Cowdenbeath police station before being released.
Martin has admitted robbing the Yorkshire Building Society in Oban on
November 24 last year after menacing staff with a knife.
He has denied taking part in an #8500 wages robbery at Glencraig,
Fife, in 1992, and assaulting and abducting bookmaker Mr Joseph
Campbell, 36, and his wife, Catherine, 32, and robbing them of #2000 at
Ballingry, Fife, on November 6 last year.
Martin has also denied presenting a sawn-off shotgun at two policemen
in Ballingry, on October 29 last year.
The court heard from Martin, whom an earlier witness said was known as
''Hawk'', that after the robbery in Oban he had gone on the run with
Miss Bryce to Wales, Ireland, and Spain.
0 Martin earlier claimed that the abduction of Mr and Mrs Campbell and
the couple's subsequent robbery was ''a wee scam'' he and Mr Campbell
cooked up.
The trial, before Lord Gill, continues.

YOUNGSTERS who take ecstasy are playing Russian roulette with their
lives, a drugs squad officer warned yesterday.
Officers heading an anti-drugs campaign in Tayside revealed that
nearly #10,000 worth of illegal substances had been seized in the region
in the first four weeks of an offensive against dealers and abusers.
Detective Inspector Fiona Clacher, head of the force's drugs squad,
vowed that police would continue the policy indefinitely in the battle
against drugs.
Since Operation Spike began in September, more than #8000 worth of
drugs had been seized and 40 people had been reported to the
procurator-fiscal. Ecstasy, cannabis, amphetamine, and cannabis plants
had been recovered in police raids.
The force is hoping to involve every officer in the effort to combat
the drugs menace in the region, from Dundee to rural communities
throughout Tayside.
Inspector Clacher said that the mother and father of ecstasy coma girl
Leah Betts could have been ''any parents in Tayside''.
She said: ''Ecstasy is extremely harmful because when someone takes a
tablet they don't have a clue what it will do to them.
''But they are playing Russian roulette. The drug itself is dangerous
and unstable.''
Drug detection in Tayside is already up by 25% this year and the
campaign hopes to increase that figure.
Meanwhile, in Stornoway, Councillor Donald Macleod, chairman of the
Western Isles arts and leisure committee, said everything possible
should be done to eradicate drugs from the islands. His plea followed an
incident at the weekend when 15-year old Dave Stewart, of Point, was in
a coma for 24 hours after attending a rave in Stornoway Town Hall. It
had been claimed he was given a spiked drink.
A council spokesman said: ''A full investigation has been carried out
into the organisation of Friday night's event and we are satisfied that
the organisers, M8 Magazine, complied with all the rules laid down by
the council.
''Prior to the event taking place, full consultation took place both
with the police and health board and all relgulations including the
presence of qualified first aiders were fully complied with.

A CONTRACT to build the new #2m headquarters of the North of Scotland
Water Authority has been won by Upland Tulloch Developments Ltd of
Inverness.
The recommendation for Tulloch, drawn up in consultation with the
Scottish Office, was taken by the authority's board at its meeting in
Kirkwall yesterday.
In August, The Herald revealed that the Morrison Group had been
working with the authority for some weeks preparing a brief for the new
building, and managed to submit a planning application three days before
competitors had received the specifications.
It emerged that the reason Morrison had been chosen was that the
authority had asked Highlands and Islands Enterprise to suggest a
company. HIE's sole suggestion was Morrison, chaired by HIE chairman
Fraser Morrison.
The Herald also revealed that the authority, chaired by Mr John
Robertson, chairman of Highland Health Board and, at that time, also a
member of the HIE board, subsequently rebuffed overtures from other
Highland companies to meet to discuss the authority's needs.
Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch ordered an inquiry which
reported that there was ''no inside track''.
Mr Robertson said the controversy over the contract had had no effect
whatsoever on the outcome.
Asked whether Tulloch's was the lowest tender, he said: ''This is the
one which won, according to the standard public tendering process. This
is the one which gave us best value for money, and it was scrutinised by
the Scottish Office Estates Division and by the Scottish Office Building
Directorate.''
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's former trade and industry spokesman said
last night: ''I am sure that the publicity has been very good for the
tendering process in this case and in general. All the criticism of what
had taken place, until The Herald intervened, remains entirely valid.''
The new building will be at Beechwood North, Inverness and be ready
for occupation in late autumn next year.

Alan MacDermid, Medical Correspondent, writes: thesymptoms being

quite genuine even if they are caused by panic, a psychologist said last
night.
Dr James Baxter, of Strathclyde University -- an expert on hypnosis
and suggestibility -- said: ''They have to be taken seriously --
illnesses that have a psychosomatic origin can still kill you,'' he
pointed out.
''It is possible for people to be suffering symptoms without
particularly noticing them until it happens to someone else, so that
might explain something with a physical cause apparently spreading from
factory to factory.
''But even if the cause is psychological it can still have a serious
effect -- people who are under stress can have their lives threatened
even if the stress is mental.

TWO British students survived an avalanche in Nepal after struggling
free from the snow and phoning for help using a radio telephone they
found on the body of another climber.
The students, Charles Wright from Suffolk and James Ryan from
Yorkshire, were feared dead in the avalanche which caught them when they
were trekking near Mount Everest. Some 26 people were killed, including
13 Japanese.
After telephoning for help, they were airlifted out of the area by
helicopter. They were then able to telephone their parents who had spent
24 hours fearing the worst.
They were among hundreds of foreign walkers caught in one of Nepal's
worst series of avalanche disasters which have killed at least 43 people
including an Irish woman.
She was named yesterday as Mary Harkins from Leighlinbridge, County
Carlow, who was in her 30s. She was in a party of eight trekkers who
died when an avalanche buried tourist lodges they were staying at in the
foothills of the Annapurna mountains, 250 miles from Kathmandu.
Ms Harkins, who was identified through her passport, was travelling
with her Canadian fiance, Mr Mitch Harper. A nurse who travelled
extensively, she was from a family of seven children.
As helicopters raced against time to find more people missing in the
snow, the families of the two students celebrated their good fortune.
''He kept shouting 'I'm alive mum, I'm alive dad, I'm alive','' said
Mr Wright's mother Petronella at her home in Barnby, near Beccles,
Suffolk.
''We couldn't believe it. We thought 'Thank God he is safe'. We heard
about the disaster on Sunday and did not hear from Charles until
yesterday.
''We knew he was one of the ones still out there and we just prayed he
was not one of the ones who had been killed.
''It is amazing that the radio telephone was still working after being
buried under the snow and rocks. It saved their lives.''
Mr Wright had celebrated his 22nd birthday in Nepal and was on his way
to Australia after graduating from university.
His university friend Mr Ryan, 22, from Huddersfield, had gone with
him on the first part of the journey to Nepal to trek on the mountains.
He will return to Britain this week.
Rescuers in helicopters continued searching yesterday for the missing
foreign trekkers, including Britons, believed to be cut off and trapped
by other avalanches.
Seventeen people are believed to have died in avalanches in the Manang
region where Ms Harkins died, including two Canadians and a German. One
Briton who was identified as missing after his backpack was found, was
named as Nicholas Ellman.
Helicopters had by yesterday plucked 477 people including 178
foreigners from the snows, mostly from the Everest region which was
hardest hit area.
Nine Britons were among those rescued.

A TEENAGER who sold ecstasy at Hanger 13 in Ayr where three young men
died was yesterday sentenced to four years' detention.
Lord Milligan told 19-year-old Charles Partridge: ''You were a vital
link in an evil trade which can wreck lives, and frequently does so.''
Partridge had earlier admitted supplying ecstasy and amphetamines at
the rave venue and at his home between April 1 and August 31 last year.
He also admitted possessing cannabis resin.
The High Court at Kilmarnock had heard that Partridge sold ecstasy
tablets to young people at the nightclub for #12 each.
Advocate-depute Valerie Stacey, prosecuting, said Partridge regularly
attended Saturday raves. Several youngsters were questioned and all
confirmed they had bought drugs from Partridge.
Police who raided his home at Lomond Place, Castlepark, Irvine, found
''tick lists'' detailing his drug deals and two pieces of cannabis resin
which he said were for his own use.
Mr Bill Dunlop, defending, said Partridge's father died when he was 15
and he had clashed with his mother's new partner. He had gone to stay in
accommodation next to Hanger 13 and had become involved in drugs.
Sentence had been deferred for two weeks for a social inquiry report.
Lord Milligan sentenced Partridge at the High Court in Airdrie
yesterday to four years' detention for supplying ecstasy and three years
for supplying amphetamines, with both sentences to run concurrently.
Partridge was admonished for possessing cannabis resin.
The judge criticised security at Hanger 13 for allowing Partridge to
''get away with it for an extensive period''.

A MAJOR Scottish venue has banned raves. The Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre yesterday also cancelled an event billed as ''a
fashion show with music and entertainment'' planned for November 25.
A sell-out audience of 3200 youngsters was expected at the Glasgow
venue.
Last night, organisers of the show said they were angered by the
decision. They said they ran raves responsibly and in line with Scottish
Office guidelines.
The SECC show, with rave music, was to be organised by Glasgow-based
music magazine M8.
It put on the rave in Stornoway town hall on Friday after which island
schoolboy David Stewart, 15, spent more than 24 hours in a coma.
Last night M8 publisher David Faulds said the SECC turnaround would
cost his company about #50,000.
He alleged breach of contract and said: ''We're taking legal advice.''
Mr Faulds said: ''We are being blamed for an incident where a boy on
the Isle of Lewis would have died if I personally had not made sure he
was put in an ambulance. He didn't want to go but I made him.''
The SECC statement said it had discussed recent events with police.
Last night SECC director of marketing Robert Eynon added: ''The incident
in Stornoway may have contributed to our decision, but it was not a
principal factor. We just do not want the culture that surrounds raves
at the SECC.
''It's a blanket ban. That's the end of the matter.''
Councillor Donald Macleod, chairman of arts and leisure in the Western
Isles, yesterday said he was satisfied that M8 had run the Stornoway
rave as well as possible.
''They complied with all rules laid down by the council.
''Consultations took place with police, the health board, and all
regulations including provision of first aiders were complied with,'' he
said.

YESTERDAY'S victory for Locate in Scotland will have been even sweeter
since it involved beating off a counter-bid from its Irish rival, which
has frequently stolen a march in the past.
The Industrial Development Agency (Ireland), the country's inward
investment arm, admitted yesterday that the loss of Chunghwa was deeply
felt.
Public relations manager Mr Michael Flood said: ''We are disappointed,
because we made every effort to secure this deal.
''It would have been a very useful addition to our electronics
industry, and a part of the industry that we do not have at present.''
The IDA's chief executive, Mr Kieran McGowan, and the Irish Minister
for Enterprise and Employment, Mr Richard Bruton, both travelled to
Taiwan in separate attempts to woo Chunghwa's senior management.
However, Mr Flood said he believed the Scottish bid had succeeded
through a combination of three reasons:
* The financial incentives available in Scotland.
* The fact that two of Chunghwa's major customers were based in the
UK.
* The availability of a ''critical'' raw material -- specialist glass
-- in the UK.

ONE of Central region's two general hospitals could be reduced to an
outpatients-only service under a major shake-up being considered by
health chiefs.
A report by consultants Touche Ross, to go before members of Forth
Valley Health Board tomorrow, suggests the radical plan as one of 14
options designed to take the royal infirmaries at Stirling and Falkirk
into the next century.
Board members will pick a short leet for public discussion and
consultation.
Director of public health medicine for Forth Valley, Dr Malcolm
McWhirter, said consultants, GPs and hospital doctors had made it clear
they favoured centralisation of in-patient services at either Stirling
or Falkirk.
The hospital not providing in-patient services would be free to
develop as a centre for day surgery and out-patient treatment.
The health board refused to comment on likely job losses.
The short leet published tomorrow will mark the start of a period of
''public discussion'' intended to continue until January.
The board will then decide on a strategy, which will be put out for
formal consultation.
The proposals will go to the Scottish Office in July.

SHEER good fortune helped Locate In Scotland seal the Chunghwa Picture
Tube deal for Lanarkshire -- luck, plus the fruits of months of
persistent hard work.
For last August, when Chunghwa was on the point of deciding on its
preferred bid, Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch headed a
Scottish trade mission to Taiwan.
Political sensitivities with mainland China dictate that the number of
British Ministerial visits to Taiwan is severely restricted. It so
happened that George Kynoch had been allocated that particular slot at
just the right time.
On his arival in Taiwan, he went in to bat for the Lanarkshire bid,
flanked by Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish
Enterprise, Mr Godfrey Robson, representing the Scottish Office industry
department, and Mr Martin Togneri, director of Locate In Scotland.
That was the crunch meeting. The deal was done there and then, subject
to Locate In Scotland being able to deliver the financial package of
Government and local incentives, and that night, the Scots and Chunghwa
representatives went out for a celebratory dinner.
Yesterday came the formal announcement that Scotland had won a #260m
investment package, the UK's largest ever, which will bring 3300 direct
jobs and an estimated 1250 spin-off jobs to one of the UK's unemployment
blackspots.
In fact, the deal took seven months to land and Mr Kynoch was involved
from the very start, when he hosted a dinner for Chunghwa's
representatives at Bute House when they first came to look at Scottish
sites.
If the hard graft was done by Locate In Scotland and Lanarkshire
Development Agency, most agree that it was the Government's obvious
commitment and Mr Kynoch's close involvement that may have helped make a
difference.
The Taiwanese looked at other sites in the UK -- one in south
Yorkshire, one in Northern Ireland, and, very closely, at one in South
Wales, where a glass production factory already exists.
Outside the UK, the closest rival bid is believed to have come from
Ireland, which was hoping to attract the project to a site near Dublin,
followed by a site in Alsace, France.
Mr Togneri said yesterday that the agency had been chasing Chunghwa's
parent company, Tatung, for quite some time, but to no avail.
It was Mr Glen Massey, a consultant with Coopers and Lybrand, who had
been hired as an external adviser by Chunghwa, who alerted LIS to the
project. Based on Chunghwa's criteria, he suggested Scotland as one of a
number of possible locations, and in early April, Chunghwa's team
visited Scotland for the first time and looked at various sites. Mossend
was the only one that interested them.
''We made a very persuasive pitch to them on the strength of the
computer industry in Scotland and their likely future markets in Europe.
The strength of that was to keep them talking to us,'' said Mr Togneri.
Mr Kynoch flew up to Scotland that night specifically to host a dinner
for Chunghwa's European manufacturing director Mr Charles Yu, and its
President, Mr C Y Lin. Over May and June, there were further
deliberations.
''We visited them in Taipei to learn more at first hand of their
proposals. At that follow up meeting with the company, we went over in
more detail the benefits that Scotland would have to offer,'' said Mr
Togneri.
In July, Chunghwa visited Britain to look at other locations, but did
not come to Scotland.
''That was a nail-biting time for all of us. Mr Kynoch met them in
July on that UK trip. Then we progressed into August and it became clear
to us that Scotland was emerging as the front UK location. We went to
the company in late August when Mr Kynoch was in Taiwan on a trade
mission,'' said Mr Togneri.
From that time on, it was a question of hammering out the financial
shape of the deal.
The Irish are believed to have offered a larger incentives package
than the Scots -- which is thought to be around the #80m mark -- but
their labour costs are believed to be higher.
For its part, the Welsh Development Agency was yesterday saying
diplomatically it was ''disappointed'' at having lost out, but was
claiming that the Mossend bid had attracted greater Government aid.
No-one on the Scottish team was prepared yesterday to confirm that the
package of incentives was around #80m, or that it is believed to be one
of the biggest provided to date by the Government.
Certainly, it was approved at Treasury level because it had passed the
#25m threshold mark which requires Treasury approval.
The package consisted mainly of regional selective assistance
(available to various parts of the UK) and a local benefits package put
together by Lanarkshire Development Agency and the local authorities.
By locating in an enterprise zone, Chunghwa was also entitled to
accelerated depreciation of the Corporation Tax allowance on industrial
buildings and help with rates payments for the first 10 years.
Considerable aid will also be offered in setting up training packages
locally and in the actual construction of the factory, which at 1.2
million sq ft is almost four times the size of the Scottish Exhibition
and Conference Centre in Glasgow.
Chunghwa's representatives said yesterday that, while the Government
incentives package was a factor in their decision, it was not decisive.
They have never told the Scots exactly why they eventually chose
Mossend, but it seems likely that the site itself -- its size and
location, close to the Mossend rail freight terminal -- was very
important.
Add to that the quality of a workforce that had received a high level
of skills training through long association with the steel industry,
lower labour costs, and an infrastructure considered superior to
Ireland's, and we are probably closer to the mark in analysing why
Mossend was given the final vote.
By expanding outside Taiwan, Chunghwa is looking to mainland Britain
and Europe for its customers. By choosing Ireland, the company would
have faced a considerably lower Corporation Tax bill, but it might have
had two sea crossings to negotiate when exporting.
Some sources also believe that the Taiwanese wanted to be part of the
bigger industrial base that Britain offered, rather than the smaller
Irish operation.
Mr Brian Cole, the head of the LIS Asia Pacific desk, confirmed
yesterday that the subject of Scottish home rule and possible
implications for taxation, had come up once during negotiations.
''The company is aware of one or two articles on that subject,'' he
said. However, they had been reassured in discussions.
Dr John Reid, the Labour MP for Motherwell, said that Chungwha's
decision showed that hard-headed businesses were not put off by the
prospect of a Labour government.
He added that, while he had been a frequent critic of Government
Ministers when things had gone wrong, he would not deny George Kynoch
credit where things had gone right.
Dr Reid also paid tribute to the team effort from the Scottish Office,
development agencies, and local authorities.
Ten years ago, he had been marching with other Lanarkshire workers to
save the Gartcosh plant, he said. Now the time had come to look forward
at the new opportunities that the agencies hope will follow in
Chungwha's wake, rather than back at the decline of the steel industry.

GOVERNMENT plans to be announced today clamping down on raves in
Scotland were dismissed last night by civil liberty experts.
It is understood that a further tightening of the rules is planned in
the Queen's Speech, despite strict rules brought in recently under the
Criminal Evidence and Public Order Act.
''This contained very severe measures restricting the operation of
raves and was criticised by many bodies as overly repressive,'' said
Scottish Council for Civil Liberties chairman Alan Miller.
''We criticised the Act as unnecessarily severe for criminalising
whole sections of youth culture, and the ink is barely dry on that,'' he
said. ''If any further legislation is coming out, we will be asking what
has changed in these few short months?''
It is believed that Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is keen to
empower local authorities to insist on things like plentiful supplies of
water and ''chill-out'' areas for ravers. Deaths at raves, usually
involving the drug ecstasy, are normally triggered by dehydration.
It will be down to police to enforce the new regulations and their
strength is already fully stretched. They want to see resources brought
up to levels south of the Border, and Mr Forsyth has already promised
more officers on the beat.
Of the latest crackdown of raves, Labour's home affairs spokesman John
McFall said: ''This is another example of Michael Forsyth's frenetic
daily drive to capture the political agendas. This problem should have
been dealt with a long time ago, and does not strike me as meriting a
major piece of legislation.''
Meanwhile, it has been revealed that the ecstasy tablet taken by
18-year-old Leah Betts was not contaminated.
As she remained critically ill on a ventilator at Broomfield Hospital,
Chelmsford, Essex, Dr Alasdair Short, consultant physician in the
intensive therapy unit, said a toxicology test had found no abnormal
substances. He said only the chemical components of the drug were found.
''As far as we can tell, they were unable to find any other components
other than the components of ecstasy'' he said.
Dr Short was unable to comment on why Leah's reaction was so
devastating. There was not a great deal of experience with ecstasy,
although there had been similar cases of people collapsing after taking
the drug.
''There are no certainties in life -- it is probable (the drug caused
the reaction) but I couldn't say.''
Leah collapsed after taking the tablet, marked with an apple motif, at
her 18th birthday party on Sunday at her parents' home at Latchingdon,
near Maldon, Essex.
Her parents, Paul and Janet Betts, who have made an emotional plea to
youngsters to say no to drugs, are at their daughter's bedside.
Essex Police revealed that on November 3, just over a week before Leah
took ecstasy, they raided a home in Westcliff-on-Sea and seized 25
ecstasy tablets with the same apple motif. A 23-year-old man was
arrested and released on police bail until January, pending further
inquiries, said a spokesman. Police have received several calls offering
information about the drug scene in Essex. Five people, aged between 17
and 19, have already been interviewed and released on police bail.

LABOUR last night launched a fresh attack on the Government's plans to
abolish capital gains tax, claiming it would cost the public purse #3bn
a year by the end of the century.
On the eve of the Queen's Speech, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown
produced figures which, he said, showed that the very best-off would
gain twice -- once from the gains on assets they already hold and again
from opportunities for tax avoidance.
He claimed that in the last year for which figures are available
(1991-92), only 86,000 individuals and trusts paid capital gains tax, so
just one in 300 taxpayers would gain.
A privileged few would gain millions, with fewer than 500 people, each
disposing of assets worth more than #1m, gaining a total of at least
#217m -- about #434,000 each.
Mr Brown said: ''John Major argued in 1988 that to prevent tax
avoidance he was aligning the rates of capital gains tax and income tax.
Now he says he will do the opposite by abolishing capital gains tax.
''This lurch to the right represents a slap in the face for the
hard-working majority. It is a commitment to subsidise a privileged few
-- a handout to the tax-avoidance industry -- and it will cost #3bn a
year.
''John Major first made his promise to abolish capital gains tax when
he was standing for re-election as leader of the Conservative Party. He
has since repeated it on several occasions, including at his party's
annual conference.''
The Shadow Chancellor claimed that abolition of CGT would do nothing
to create wealth in Britain. There would be no distinction between
individuals who made gains through speculation on the stock market and
those who created wealth by growing real businesses.
He argued that the way to create wealth is by using the tax system to
encourage investment and commitment through the longer-term holding of
assets. For this reason, Labour is attracted to the CBI proposal for a
two-tier CGT.
Mr Brown claimed: ''Abolition of CGT will be the biggest transfer of
wealth to a privileged elite in living memory. Never will so many have
subsidised so few.''
In a renewed attack on what he described as ''a boardroom bonanza,''
he said directors would be able to cash in share options granted before
July 17 this year without paying any tax.
He said: ''Senior executives of monopoly utilities will make millions
in windfall gains on share options. For example, the directors and
senior executives of National Power will gain up to #6.7m.
''The directors and senior executives of the privatised water and
electricity companies stand to gain up to #40m by paying no tax on share
options. Abolishing CGT will be the biggest transfer of wealth to an
elite we have seen this century. It will do nothing for the ordinary
taxpayer.''

CBI director-general Adair Turner, in his closing speech, called for a
Budget that took no risks with borrowing levels and interest rates.
''We don't want the Government to throw away the hard-earned benefit
of its own prudent policies over the last three years and we hope it
won't,'' he said.
He said the UK's economic prospects remained attractive despite the
present slowdown and they could be made better still if priorities for
further action were considered clearly.
''It may suit some people to talk of UK economy in relative decline or
crisis, but it is wrong and it can undermine the confidence needed for
further improvement,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Bishop questions validity for today of Bible's moral code</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Episcopal Bishop of Edinburgh stepped into fresh controversy last
night when he questioned the validity to today's generation of the
Bible's moral codes.
Delivering a lecture at Strathclyde University, the Most Rev Bishop
Richard Holloway, Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, criticised
calls to return to so-called biblical morality.
As a ''male-centred, patriarchal creature of its time'' the Bible's
moral code must be re-written every generation, he said.
Earlier this year, the bishop found himself at the centre of
controversy over later disputed comments on adultery. The bishop had
been quoted as saying that, as God gave humans promiscuous genes, it
would be wrong to condemn people who followed their instincts. When the
controversy broke, the bishop said his remarks had been misrepresented
and that he had been ''stitched up''.
At last night's lecture, sponsored by The Herald, the bishop said
society faced moral challenges unthinkable a generation ago and there
was a constant need for debate on the best moral system.
Describing moralising as one of the least attractive human
characteristics, he argued that as rational creatures seeking human
well-being, people were forced to find appropriate moral rules for their
own culture that reflected their needs, knowledge and understanding.
''The Bible is still a useful guide but we have to recognise it is a
creature of its time. This is particularly true of its moral systems.''
He added: ''There is no single moral system in scripture that we can
easily read from it and apply straightforwardly. We need to engage in
debate about the best moral systems, need to identify where changes can
be made, where things can be abandoned, where we should overturn old
ways and experiment with new.''
But given the content of last night's Town and Gown lecture, entitled,
Is God a Fundamentalist?, the bishop was bound to upset some who adhere
to the literacy of the Bible.
Professor James Whyte, a former Moderator of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, said that there was a small but growing number
of people keen to stick to the certainties of scripture.
The Rev Alex MacDonald, of the Free Church of Scotland, said Mr
Holloway had failed to take account of the progressive nature of
revelation in the Bible.''The bishop seems to deny moral absolutes. But
if morality is absolutely relative, how can we say anything is wrong?
Murder? Child abuse? Oppression? Is it all just a matter of opinion or
culture?''
His views were echoed by the Rev Peter White, principal of the Glasgow
Bible College, who said he adhered to the view that morality did not
change.
''When confronted with a moral question, Jesus went straight back to
what was written in scripture. Faced with a situation on divorce not
unlike that in Scotland today, Jesus went back to scripture. The Bible's
approach to morality can be trusted.''
However, Father Tom Connelly, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church,
said he largely agreed with Mr Holloway's argument. He said the Roman
Catholic church had always held that morality was a combination of
scripture and tradition. ''What Mr Holloway is trying to say to people
is that the God we believe in is not enshrined in such a manner that his
movement is restricted,'' he said.
In his lecture, the bishop stressed that the beauty of the Bible was
that it showed a serious people seriously evolving appropriate moral
structures for their day.
As a result, they gave today's generation the confidence to do the
same. However, he said, to claim to be able to read out from the Old
Testament a timeless moral code was problematic.
He said that the force of the commandment ''Thou shalt not commit
adultery'', for instance, was very different in our culture to what it
was at the time of its promulgation.
''First of all, in the Old Testament, it is addressed only to the
male, and the male already does much in the sexual sphere: he may have
several wives and concubines; he may even throw out his wife with little
ado if she displeases him.
''What he is not allowed to do, and this is the precise focus of the
commandment, is to interfere with the marriage of another male, because
if he fertilises another man's wife unlawfully he will confuse the laws
of inheritance.
''Adultery was stealing, making use of another male's sexual property,
because that's what a wife was. By contrast, the woman is allowed little
or nothing and is really a species of property in a male-dominated
society.
''Today the church would base its opposition to adultery on different,
more consequentialist grounds; it destroys trust, is productive of
enormous human pain and it applies to both men and women.''
Today, the bishop said, we faced moral challenges unthinkable to
previous generations. The most obvious one, he said, had been the
invention of reliable methods of contraception.
''This has totally altered human attitudes to sex. Sex that is
theoretically free from the consequences of pregnancy will, in practice,
be thought of very differently from sex that almost invariably led to
it,'' he said.
On the moral values of order and freedom, the bishop said they
frequently conflicted and people tended to characterise themselves by
leaning towards one value or the other.
''There are people who prize order highly. They are disciplined,
sometimes emotionally repressed, frequently authoritarian in outlook.
These characteristics produce results that can be good and bad.
''Those who prize the values of freedom, on the other hand, may be
less disciplined, more relaxed about things authoritarians think are
fundamental; there may even be a certain moral laziness in their
make-up, but they allow people the space to grow and be different.
''There is no doubt that each side of this debate has its strengths
and weaknesses,'' he said.

ONLY one woodland sold off by the Forestry Commission in Scotland is
covered by a public access agreement, the policy introduced by the
Government in 1991 to protect the traditional freedom to roam that
exists in Scotland's publicly-owned forests.
Inquiries by The Herald disclose that, of the 219 Scottish woodlands
sold since the measure was implemented, only one is covered by the
legally enforceably agreement. Another 66,000 acres have gone to private
buyers since 1991 with no access agreement in place.
The Forestry Commission is under orders to sell off 250,000 acres of
publicly-owned woodlands throughout the UK by the end of the century.
However, campaigners are now calling on Mr Michael Forsyth, the
Secretary of State for Scotland, who also holds the UK forestry
portfolio, to halt all further sales until improved protection for the
rights of access can be introduced.
An inter-departmental report compiled for Ministers by civil servants,
and lodged in the library of the House of Commons last February
confirmed that the existing policy is not working.
Under the measure, introduced after pressure from the environmental
lobby who claimed the sell-off of public land jeopardised public access,
the Forestry Commission is supposed to gain agreements with local
authorities on a legally-binding right of access when woodland is sold
off.
However, Government figures in October showed that while 628 woodlands
have been sold since 1991 in the UK, there are just six public access
agreements in England, 16 in Wales, and only the one in Scotland.
The Forestry Commission claims there are now 28 agreements in place on
woodlands that have been sold. But only one remains concluded in
Scotland. There are, it says, a further 44 agreements in the pipeline.
It claims that it has operated a policy of choosing woodlands and
forests for sale that were not greatly used by the public.
The Ramblers Association, however, claims current policy is in
''shambles'' and is denying the public access to tens of thousands of
acres of woodlands across the country where once they enjoyed freedom to
walk. It wants the policy toughened up and legislation introduced to
ensure the freedom to roam when woodlands are sold off.

A TEACHER walked free from court yesterday after charges of indecently
assaulting two girl pupils were found not proven.
Mr Leonard Hart said: ''That is the same as not guilty. I am happy.''
But he warned: ''There is a lesson in this for all teachers. Never touch
a pupil. I tried to make my classes fun and that involved an element of
physical contact. I have paid the price for that with a 20-month-long
nightmare.
''It has ruined my life and my career. There is no place in teaching
for anyone like me any more. Now I would cross the street to avoid
children.''
The 51-year-old, from Edinburgh, was a technical teacher at a West
Lothian Secondary School for 12 years.
He could not remember any contact between himself and the two teenage
girls on the day they claimed he assaulted them.
The girls, aged 13 and 14, said he was sexually aroused in the
classroom on March 9 last year when he put his arms round them and
pulled them back towards him until he was touching their backs.
But Hart told the court: ''It never happened.'' He said the first he
heard of the incident was from the school's head teacher the next day.
He sometimes leaned over pupils as he showed them how to operate
equipment and sometimes leaned on them. He added: ''It is really a
participation thing.''
He told Linlithgow Sheriff Court that a disciplinary hearing at
Lothian region had recommended his sacking.
But he resigned first on advice from his trade union. Sheriff Grahame
Fleming said: ''I do not feel able to treat what the girls said as
sufficiently acceptable evidence of the guilt of the accused.''
Hart has lodged a complaint against the region for constructive
dismissal.

GRAMPIAN Health Board yesterday opened tendering for the new
Stonehaven Hospital.
Private companies will be asked in advertisements in the Health
Service Journal and official journal of the European Union to bid for
contracts to build, equip, and run the new facility which will serve
Aberdeen.
Bidders must respond before Christmas when a short-leet of three or
four will be drawn up. They will then be asked to submit detailed
tenders in April next year.
Dr Hamish Wilson, the board's director of service planning and
contracts, said that a final decision would be made by the end of May,
with the hospital up and running by the spring of 1997.
The project is an extension of the government's Private Finance
Initiative, designed to attract new investment into the health service,
and it has provoked a political storm.
The Labour Party, the British Medical Association, and the health
unions claim the Scottish Office-approved scheme is the first step on
the road to NHS privatisation.
At a press conference in Aberdeen yesterday, Mr Wilson refused to name
companies which have shown interest. But he pointed out that other NHS
trusts in Britain, including Grampian Healthcare Trust which provides
hospital services in the Stonehaven area, could bid.
Mr Wilson explained that the private sector was brought to finance the
#2.5m project because it could provide the capital more quickly than the
cash-strapped NHS.

<HEADLINE>Judges hear incompetence grounds plea</HEADLINE>

A SPECIAL Bench of five judges is being asked to rule that
incompetence by a defence lawyer may be a ground for challenging a
conviction under Scots law.
The Court of Criminal Appeal is being urged to disapprove of a case
from 1949 which decided that incompetent legal representation was not a
basis for claiming a miscarriage of justice.
The outcome of the present appeal by James Anderson is being anxiously
awaited by lawyers, who fear it could open the floodgates to disgruntled
prisoners unhappy about their convictions.
However, a decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal to disapprove of
the ruling in the 46-year-old case of McCarroll and provide an
''incompetence'' appeal within strictly defined limits would bring
Scotland into line with a number of other legal systems.
Since the decision in 1949 was made by three judges, a bench of five
is required to change it.
Anderson, 43, was jailed for three years and nine months at the High
Court in Glasgow in February last year after being convicted of assault
to severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
He has served his sentence and is due to be released today.
Anderson claims that the solicitor-advocate who represented him at his
trial failed to follow his instructions to attack the character of the
victim in the case, who had a number of previous convictions.
He alleges that, because of this alleged incompetence, he suffered a
miscarriage of justice.
Yesterday, Mr Graham Bell QC, defence counsel, asked Lord Justice
General Hope, sitting with Lord Justice Clerk Ross and Lords Sutherland,
Cameron and Johnston, to rule that McCarroll was no longer good law.
In that case, a man convicted on two charges of theft by housebreaking
asked for leave to appeal because his solicitor failed to ensure that he
received a fair trial.
It was alleged that the solicitor, who had been appointed to the case
only two days beforehand, had not competently cross-examined Crown
witnesses, with the result that the defence case had not not been
properly placed before the jury.
The Court of Criminal Appeal ruled, however, that a lack of skill or
diligence in the preparation or conduct of a case could not be pleaded
as a ground for claiming a miscarriage of justice.
Mr Bell argued that much of the reasoning of the judges in the 1949
case was based on the fact that it was not open to the court in those
days to allow a new trial following a successful appeal. The only option
was to quash the conviction and set the appellant free.
The appeal court now had powers to set aside a conviction and allow
the Crown to bring a fresh prosecution.
The court would have to consider what test should be applied if it
accepted that the 1949 case could no longer stand.
Mr Bell suggested that the judges would have to be satisfied that, as
a result of incompetent legal representation, an accused person's
defence had not been properly placed before the court.
The defence must be important and bound, or at least likely, to have
had a material bearing on the decision of the jury.
The court would also have to be satisfied that a miscarriage of
justice had occurred.
The hearing continues.

A HEAD teacher's career was in ruins yesterday after she was convicted
of possessing cannabis.
Sandra Logan, 33, will probably never be allowed to teach again,
Kirkwall Sheriff Court was told.
She maintained she was unaware there was cannabis in her pocket at a
beach barbecue in Orkney. But Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie told her
there was overwhelming evidence of her guilt.
The sheriff fined her #100 after telling her that the possession of
drugs was a ''frightening plague of our time''.
Logan, formerly of School House, Eday, and now of Mains of
Inverallochy, Fraserburgh, had been head of the single-teacher Eday
school for two years.
She said she had been under suspension and had recently resigned. ''It
was for family reasons,'' she said. ''I thought it was the most suitable
thing to do for my son.''
Logan, who said she would never be allowed to teach again if
convicted, said the barbecue was held to celebrate her son's sixth
birthday. Her ex-husband, Patric Flynn, her mother, and former
mother-in-law had been present.
She said she had borrowed a body-warmer from Mr Flynn, and had no idea
the cannabis was in a top pocket.
Flynn, 36, unemployed, of Murray Place, Stirling, told the court he
had been in possession of both amphetamine and the cannabis found on
Logan at the party.
After Logan's conviction, he pleaded guilty to possession of 1.82
grammes of amphetamine with a street value of #20 and was fined #150.

A RIGOROUS new set of rules was needed to control standards of
administration in further education, the Nolan Committee was told
yesterday.
The committee into standards in public life heard from union leaders
representing lecturers and staff in further education who claimed that
there was concern over the standards of governing bodies in this sector.
After his private hearings into the standard and conduct of MPs and
Ministers, Lord Nolan has turned his attention to local public spending
bodies for this, the second part of his investigation into standards in
public life.
This includes higher and further education bodies, grant-maintained
schools, training and enterprise councils, local enterprise companies
and housing associations.
Yesterday's hearing in London was the Nolan committee's first public
session and it focused on higher education.
Among the issues being considered are the payment of governors, the
composition of governing bodies and the accountability of the bodies to
their education institutions.
Mr Derek Betts, head of policy for the National Association of
Teachers in Further and Higher Education told the committee there needed
to be a change in regulations to improve accountability in governing
bodies.
The union is pushing for changes to the schedule to the Education
Reform Act 1988 and the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The union
wants to see more representative governing bodies, a fixed term of
office for governors and a code of practice.
tees of governing bodies often tended to secrecy and had ''an
unwillingness to report back'' to the staff and students.
Ms Seddon said there was increasing concern about the ''corporate
identity'' of further education colleges and staff were expected to be
loyal to their institution rather than to their academic discipline or
students.
Commercial considerations were putting a strain on academics and staff
often felt unable to raise complaints because they were scared of losing
their jobs.
''People have felt gagged from making criticisms,'' she said.
Because of the increasing number of short-term contracts in further
education, staff were unwilling to take matters to governing bodies:
''People don't want to rock the boat,'' she said.
The answer, according to NATFHE, is to increase the accountability of
governing bodies and alter their make-up to include more people from the
local community, staff and students.

<HEADLINE>TV interview will air Diana's side of marriage break-up. Princess upsets the Palace</HEADLINE>

The Princess of Wales is to reveal her previously private thoughts on
the break-up of her marriage in her first solo television interview.
News of the ''no constraints'' Panorama interview, to be screened next
Monday, came as a total surprise to the Prince of Wales, the Queen and
senior royal household officials.
Irritated Buckingham Palace advisers were left to pass the news to the
Prince, celebrating his 47th birthday during a four-day visit to
Germany, and to the Queen at Windsor Castle.
The programme comes nearly 18 months after the Prince admitted
adultery in an ITV documentary by Jonathan Dimbleby, who later said the
only woman in the Prince's life was his close friend Camilla Parker
Bowles.
It is also nearly three years after deep divisions in what had once
been seen as a ''fairy tale marriage'' had been recognised officially
with the announcement of the formal separation.
The Princess's conversations with Panorama reporter Martin Bashir
cover ''every stage of her life as the Princess of Wales, including her
family, her separation and her future plans'', a BBC spokeswoman said.
''When she agreed to be interviewed she placed no constraints on the
subject matter or the duration of the interview which took place at
Kensington Palace earlier this month.''
It became clear last night that the Princess had decided to make the
hour-long programme without telling even senior members of her own
Kensington Palace household, let alone consult Buckingham Palace.
The interview could be a source of renewed emotional turmoil for
Prince William, 13, and Prince Harry, 11.
They may be prevented from seeing the Panorama programme, but they
face hurtful comments and questions from other children.
No official indication was given of the Palace view of the Princess's
decision, but there was no disguising strong feelings of exasperation,
in particular at the way the interview was arranged and announced.
A Palace spokesman said the first any of the royal households knew
about the programme was when the Princess of Wales made it known
yesterday, as she was departing for a visit to Broadmoor Hospital.
''We were informed about this only this morning,'' a spokesman said.
The information had come from the Princess, although he declined to give
further details about how the message was passed.
''We were not consulted about it. The project has obviously been
undertaken at the Princess of Wales's own initiative, working directly
with the BBC.''
The Palace had no knowledge about the contents of the interview beyond
what had been announced by the BBC, he said.
The BBC had made it clear that no facilities for any preview would be
given -- ''and that includes both the Princess and ourselves'' -- and
there was no plan to make any representation to the BBC, the Palace
spokesman said.
The interview, to be shown on BBC1 at 9.40pm on Monday is expected to
attract millions of viewers, especially as Panorama is refusing to
release details about its contents before transmission.
It will be broadcast in the same week that the Princess makes a
high-profile working visit to Argentina.
Speculation about the Princess's motives on turning to the BBC to air
her side of the story about her marriage will now abound.
The Princess -- whose unhappy life was first revealed in a book by
author Andrew Morton, with whom some of her friends co-operated -- is
said to have been hurt and humiliated by her husband's admission of
adultery.
The Prince said on the Jonathan Dimbleby programme that he had not
been unfaithful until after his marriage had broken down. He indicated
he still saw himself as the Queen's successor to the throne.
With speculation still rife over whether the Princess could still be
his Queen -- no plans for a divorce have ever been announced -- her TV
interview can be seen as a move to defend her future.
Mr Harold Brooks-Baker, the editor of the aristocratic directory
Burke's Peerage, said: ''I think it will be another nail in the coffin
of the monarchy.''
The Princess, while retaining some contact with Buckingham Palace
officials, is very much her own woman.
She chooses her public engagements carefully and, although advised by
Palace officials, appears to make up her own mind on what to do, when
and how to do them.
The Panorama interview took place soon after the Prince appeared in
public at a high society party at London's Ritz hotel attended by Mrs
Parker Bowles, refuelling speculation about their relationship.
The BBC spokeswoman said: ''The fact that Panorama are doing this
shows that it is a very serious current affairs interview, not a
trivialised tabloid version.''
Mr Bashir had asked for the interview some time ago, because of the
constitutional question raised by a separated heir to the throne.
The spokeswoman said: ''We requested the interview and she agreed --
it was as simple as that.
''The Princess asked that we didn't inform anybody at all until she
had spoken to the Palace, which she was only able to do this morning.''
At Broadmoor, where the Princess opened a new research and therapy
unit, meeting some of Britain's most dangerous mental patients, the
Princess gave no clue that theannouncement was due. Just 30 minutes
after she arrived at the hospital, the BBC released news of the
interview.
The Queen is not expected to watch the programme.
She is known not to take much interest in television programmes about
the Royal Family. It was reported at the time that she did not even
watch her eldest son's controversial Dimbleby interview.

<HEADLINE>TUC fears over tax on redundancy payments</HEADLINE>

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke should not use the forthcoming Budget to end
tax exemption on the first #30,000 of redundancy pay, as is widely
feared, but increase the level of pay-offs at which tax commences,
argues the TUC.
In a new report ''Robbing the Redundant'' the TUC maintains that by
taxing all redundancy pay the Chancellor could raise some #1.5 billion -
roughly the equivalent of a 1p cut in income tax.
However, TUC general secretary John Monks says that ''robbing the
redundant'' by taxing their payments in order to provide tax rebates
would be immoral and would add anxiety to the very people who the
payments are supposed to help in a difficult period in their lives.
The report maintains that that the #30,000 threshold, unchanged since
1988, is too low and should be up-rated in line with inflation and not
reduced or removed as removal would fall most heavily on workers with
moderate settlements yet leave the very large company board settlements
virtually untouched.
Rather than seeking methods of financing tax cuts ,the TUC believes
the Chancellor should be seeking ways of increasing job creating
investment in order to reduce unemployment and redundancy.
The report also reveals that in the first quarter of 1995 the
South-east excluding Greater London suffered the largest number of
redundancies (36,000) although it still had the lowest redundancy rate
(8.2 per 1000 employees). Scotland was the second lowest at 9.2 (18,000)
and Wales the highest at 14.7 (15,000).
Although manual workers still make up the bulk of those made
redundant, the increase in redundancies among managers over the past two
years is particularly striking and confirms that the effects of
deregulation and insecurity are having an impact on the whole workforce
, the TUC says.
