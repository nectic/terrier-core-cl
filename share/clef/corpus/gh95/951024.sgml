* SCOTT Welch drives a Porsche and lives in a #250,000 house in
Brighton.
The former ABA heavyweight champion, who runs homes for the elderly on
the south coast, is a pretty well-off man outside boxing.
So what drives Welch to lace up his gloves in the present depressed
atmosphere of the fight game?
It is simply the love of the sport and a thirst to succeed in the
hardest arena -- the reason why he will be happy to give away a stone
and seven inches in height to try to muscle the British heavyweight
title away from man-mountain James Oyebola at Brighton's Metropole Hotel
on Friday.
Welch will receive #16,000 for his night's endeavour -- hardly a
fortune by his standards -- but says: ''When you start amateur boxing,
it is not about money. It's about the sport. It's very hard to let go.
''Ask anyone who has boxed as a professional or amateur. When they
have been away from the game for a while, they can't wait to get back.
''In the amateurs, I had a close friend who got brain damage, but it
didn't put me off. My heart goes out to James Murray's family, but it
still goes on.''

THE Scottish Football Association have confirmed yet again that they
are against the use of television to produce evidence about incidents
which occur during matches. The Referee Committee recently discussed the
issue but would not be swayed from the view not to change the present
situation.
Yesterday, the council of the SFA in Glasgow accepted a recommendation
from the committee that ''the temptation should be resisted to regard
such information as admissible.''
Meanwhile, Hearts' Alan Lawrence should learn within 24 hours is he is
in trouble following an off-the-ball incident on Saturday with the
Rangers defender Craig Moore when the Australian was left lying on the
ground.
Referee Mike Pocock and his linesman missed the incident. But referee
supervisor Kenny Hope was in the stand and his report is awaited by the
SFA.

RANGERS proved on Saturday just how quickly they can put defeat, no
matter how severe or damaging, behind them and this evening Walter
Smith's players intend to distance themselves further from the trauma of
Turin by beating Aberdeen and reaching the final of the Coca-Cola Cup.
Nothing in this business soothes more than a handsome win.
Although Smith has yet another casualty, this time David Robertson,
who was taken off in the 4-1 win against Hearts at the weekend, he was
relaxed enough yesterday as he turned to the semi-final against
Aberdeen.
''I am able to look forward to the game after the problems of last
week,'' he said. ''Saturday's win means we can all go into the cup-tie
with a little more confidence than we might otherwise have had.''
Tonight's match gives Paul Gascoigne, whose goal scored within two
minutes of the kick-off on Saturday provided Rangers with an impetus
which carried them to victory, the chance to start his first match at
the national stadium and he sounded like a player anxious to make the
most of it.
He played for England at Hampden in 1989 when he went on as substitute
10 minutes from time in the last match between Scotland and England, who
won 2-0 with Steve Bull and Chris Waddle the scorers. ''I remember I got
a bawling out by the manager, Bobby Robson, for not passing the ball and
then I went on to nutmeg Peter Grant,'' Gascoigne said.
''When I was warming up I took a lot of stick from the Scottish fans,
but this time I'll have a few on my side.''
Although injury denied him the chance to play against Juventus, the
Englishman suffered just the same, but he harbours hope for the return
game and pointed out that Rangers must learn from what they saw. Indeed,
he went much further and pointed out: ''The country, and I mean England
and Scotland, must learn from it because that is the way the game should
be played. A lot will depend, of course, on the players.''
During the interval on Saturday Gascoigne made a point of telling his
team-mates that their third goal was ''brilliant'' because of the manner
in which it was created and he will be looking for more tonight.
Possession is the name of Gascoigne's game and he stressed that his aim
when he goes on to a pitch is not to give the ball away to the
opposition.
''I didn't come to Ibrox to play long balls. It is all about
passing,'' he said. ''I said it would take about six months for me to
settle in here and three months down the line I feel I am a better
all-round player now than when I was playing in the 1990 World Cup
finals.
''Terry Venables told me I would get better with experience and some
players produce their best when they are 29 or 30. I feel my best has
still to come.''
His words will be music to the ears of Rangers' fans, who are looking
for greater things from their team, although it seems a fair number of
the followers won't bother going to Hampden. Live television and the
seemingly endless stream of matches is making it increasingly difficult
for them to remain loyal.
It is thought that just more than 20,000 will be at Hampden and
Aberdeen are expected to bring approximately 6000, which means there
will be empty spaces around the stadium. ''We had 45,000 at Ibrox on
Saturday for our game against Hearts, which tells you that fans consider
weekend football to be their main priority,'' said Rangers secretary
Campbell Ogilvie.
Cup matches between Rangers and Aberdeen tend to be exciting contests
and the premier-division match between the sides earlier this month
proved enthralling.
Rangers last won the cup in '93 when they beat Hibernian 2-1, but
their last cup final appearance ended in defeat. Dundee United beat them
1-0 in the Scottish Cup final in May of last year.
''It is time we won a cup trophy again,'' added Smith, who said that
no great progress was made yesterday on the transfer front. Derek
McInnes is still expected to become a Rangers player within the next few
days, even although the Ibrox club's first offer yesterday fell short of
Morton's #400,000 valuation.

THERE was a bullish mood around Pittodrie yesterday, denoting a
growing confidence which surely stems from memories of the last time
Aberdeen met Rangers, just a couple of weeks back.
That day the Glasgow side took three points home with them but the
Aberdeen players felt to a man that they had done enough to win that
game.
Since then they have waited for the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final at
Hampden to prove that they can be a match for the champions.
Indeed, their manager Roy Aitken warned Rangers: ''Your defence will
have to be strong if you are going to stop us.''
Aitken was in relaxed mood as he surveyed the match which takes place
tonight. But, then, it is no more crucial than those he faced last
season when he was ushered into the manager's office and asked to save
the club from relegation.
Then he faced potential disaster. The difference now is that a victory
will reinforce Aberdeen's credentials as a power in Scottish football
once more -- and will also take them a step closer to one of the game's
top prizes and a place in Europe next season.
Aitken is aware of all of these things. He stressed: ''There is no
need to say how important this is for Aberdeen. Everyone here realises
that we have an opportunity to win the first major honour of the season.
''But we have to focus on the semi-final. Then, if we win, we can look
towards the final and what that means.
''We took confidence from our display against Rangers at Pittodrie
even though we lost.
''They defended well that day and that is what they will have to do
tonight at Hampden.
''There is no doubt that they have been the most powerful team in the
country over the past seven years or so. The record books show that and
this season they are still setting the pace.
''Their defensive record has been exceptional and we have to try to
find a way through that set-up.
''We know that and I shall be talking to the players about the kind of
approach we may take.
''Sometimes people look back to the days when Aberdeen would travel to
Glasgow and beat the Old Firm with some regularity. But I don't think
you can compare today with those times.
''We are no longer on a level playing pitch. The game has changed so
much and the teams who are most successful are those who can spend the
most. Rangers do it here but all across Europe you will find the same
thing happening.
''The wealthiest clubs are those who win the trophies. Here in
Scotland we now have Celtic spending big money, too, and I know that
Tommy Burns is putting together a team which will challenge Rangers.
''I have been allowed to spend -- Paul Bernard is a record buy, for
instance -- and I will have more money available to me. But we can't
match the spending power of the Old Firm.
''Our major aim must always be to build a side from our youth policy
and then add other players to those we bring through the system.''
Aitken, while acknowledging the difficulties which confront him and
every other provincial manager, still relishes the job he was given
during the club's crisis period last season.
He said: ''If ever the manager's job became a burden to me then I
would just walk away.
''This is a great job with a great club and I shall never short-change
the directors, the players, or the supporters.
''I will be honest with the players and I expect them to be honest
with me.
''I believe I have had honesty from them since I took over. And the
supporters realise that these players are giving 100%.
''Anyone can make a mistake and that is forgivable. What isn't
forgivable is when a player does not give everything he has to the
cause.
''What we have asked for this season is a continuation of the attitude
the players showed when they battled to escape relegation.''
Striker Scott Booth is fit again and he will play up front while
Aitken looks likely to stay with the midfield partnership of Eoin Jess
and Paul Bernard, who both impressed with their attitude and
understanding at the weekend.

THE caring face of boxing was shown last night when around 250 fans
gathered at the St Andrews Sporting Club in Glasgow for the first
promotion in the city since the tragic ring death of Jim Murray on
October 13.
The dinner-suited audience -- club members and their guests -- stood
in silence as 10 ring-side bells were tolled in the memory of Murray,
who lost his life while challenging Drew Docherty for the British
bantamweight title amid scenes of rioting by fans.
And in London, Frank Warren announced that he will write out a cheque
for #400,000 to set up a trust fund to finance the sophisticated
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan for every boxer in Britain.
The trust fund -- entitled the Murray Stone Fund, in memory of the
last two boxers to die in a British ring -- will finance more revealing
brain checks, costing around #500 each and with approximately 800
professional boxers presently performing on the British circuit, the
move will obviously be expensive.
But Warren is willing to take a lead underwriting the scheme for the
next year with all fighters being able to draw from the fund.
Warren's pledged cash injection is timely with the British Boxing
Board of Control seemingly set to introduce compulsory MRI scans this
week.
Warren co-promoted Murray's tragic title fight, 18 months after the
previous death of Bradley Stone in a British super-featherweight
championship bout at Bethnal Green.
And Warren said: ''I'm being realistic, I don't think there's a lot
you can do regarding death and what happens in the ring. They are the
tragedies in the sport, as indeed other sports have tragedies.
''The scans are very expensive but we are setting up the Murray Stone
Trust Fund which will give every boxer in this country an MRI scan.
''That will give the BBBC a year, at least, to work out how they will
fund the future -- and if we have to give help in the future we will do
it.
''As promoters we feel we have a responsibility and, indeed, want to
put something back into the sport and something to help the boxers.
''Whoever the boxer is, he will have the facility to have an MRI scan
and it will be paid for from this fund.''
Last night, Steve McLevy from Glasgow won the main event at the St
Andrews Sporting Club when he stopped Cumbernauld's Alan Peacock after
1min. 36sec. of the sixth round to capture the vacant Scottish
light-welterweight championship.
It was a scrappy contest and pretty even until the sixth, when McLevy
rocked Peacock with two rights to the head and then sent him staggering
on to the ropes with a left hook.
Referee Len Mullen immediately stepped in and halted the contest.
Despite Peacock's protests that he was able to carry on no-one, in the
light of recent events, could fault the referee.
Glasgow's superfeather Davie McHale made his first appearance since
losing a British title fight to Flloyd Havard almost 10 months ago, and
hammered Chris Aston, of Leeds, into submission at the end of the third
round.
McHale, who says he is determined to make his mark this time, totally
overwhelmed his English opponent and although the official verdict was
that Aston had been retired due to a shoulder injury it was more likely
that the Scot's heavy body punches had forced the issue.
Garry Burrell, of Kirkcaldy, currently Scotland's most active boxer,
had his twelfth contest of the year at superfeather and added another
win to his record when he outpointed Newcastle's Ian Richardson over six
rounds.
At bantam, Wales' Richard Vowles comfortably outpointed Neil Parry, of
Middlesbrough, over six rounds.
* TEENAGE flyweight Marvin Corpuz has become the second Filipino boxer
to die within a week after a battering by his opponent in a bout in the
southern Philippines.
The two deaths follow that of James Murray eight days ago.
Corpuz died in hospital from head injuries sustained in a 10-round
fight he lost to Allan Llaneta.
Manila newspapers reported that Corpuz told his corner after the
eighth round that he wanted to quit but a jeering crowd urged him on,
shouting ''no surrender, no surrender.'' Corpuz, who had 16 professional
fights, collapsed in the ring at the end of the bout.
Another Filipino boxer, junior flyweight Restituto Espineli, also died
from head injuries suffered in a losing 10-round fight.
* MOTOR racing is the most dangerous sport in Britain, having killed
72 people in five years, Sports Minister Iain Sproat said yesteray.
He was asked in parliament for details of sport fatalities after boxer
James Murray died earlier this month following his British bantamweight
fight in Glasgow, prompting calls for boxing to be banned.
Sproat said 72 people died in motor sports from 1986 to 1991, 59 were
killed mountaineering, 29 in horse-riding accidents, and just three from
boxing.

MANAGER Tommy Burns believes Celtic can find the killer touch for just
#200,000 or so.
The Parkhead side have been slated after playing Hibs and Kilmarnock
off the park, but taking only one point from each game. Burns is still
searching for a consistent striker to turn chances into points, but he
considers that there is no need to splash out a huge transfer fee.
Burns said: ''I don't necessarily think you need to pay three or four
million to get the right player. We could buy someone for #200,000 who
could come in and prove himself -- an old-fashioned type of player who
gets into the right positions, has a nose for goal, and just puts the
ball over the line.''
Celtic's return to the stalemate form of last season has let Rangers
open up a six-point gap at the top of the league.
But Burns reckons his problem is only temporary, and is delighted with
the standard of soccer from his side. He said: ''We will get to the
stage where we will win games again. I would be a lot more concerned if
the team was playing badly and drawing matches.
''At the moment we're taking only a draw from matches we should be
winning by the length of Sauchiehall Street. It's just something we have
to live through. Unfortunately, we drew a lot of games last season and
now people are jumping on the bandwagon.
''A couple of penalty decisions have gone against us in recent games,
and these things tend to even out over the course of the season.
''I can't just say the strikers should score more -- we have to look
for goals from elsewhere in the team as well.
''But there are always irons in the fire and, if we get someone in up
front, then we will be looking to strengthen another position.
''Rangers have moved ahead, but it's not something we're going to
panic over. The season lasts for 36 games. There are too many good
things happening at the club just now.''
The man charged with tracking down a striking solution, chief scout
Davie Hay, reckons they may already have it in Pierre van Hooydonk.
Hay said: ''I think that Pierre is definitely a goalscorer. He did
score 25 goals in a season in the Dutch league.
''He plays in a style different to a normal poacher, but he will get
goals.''
Hay has been around Europe and back in his search for players to
improve the Parkhead squad and is not ready to put away his passport
just yet.He said: ''I've travelled more in the last year than I have in
the rest of my life. In fact, I'm now a silver member of British Airways
executive class!
''But it's not all glamour. I was at Stenhousemuir on Saturday and
it's also important to keep in touch at that level.
''It's my job to go and look at players, but it's up to Tommy and
Fergus McCann who comes to Celtic.
''Transfers have become a part of the game where fans need them to be
happy. It started in Italy, where clubs were almost buying players just
for the sake of the publicity and to please the fans.''
Hay had a look on Saturday at Stenhousemuir's 22-year-old striker
Gareth Hutchison, whose eighth goal of the season opened the scoring in
the Warriors' 2-1 win over Queen of the South.
The Celtic chief scout's next foreign trip is likely to be to France
to see Euro opponents Paris St Germain take on league leaders Metz this
weekend.
Meanwhile, Celtic yesterday launched a new book, Celtic, the Official
Illustated history by Graham McColl. It is published by Hamlyn books and
is available at #16.99.

WICK Academy manager Don Cowie has capped an amazing week of good
fortune by winning #10,000 in the lottery.
The 39-year-old learned of his big syndicate win just hours after
Academy returned to winning ways by beating Nairn County 3-1 on
Saturday.
His hat trick of good news began earlier last week when 12-year-old
son, Don Jr, was picked for a trial with Aberdeen. The youngster came
away with a signed pair of Scotland shorts gifted by his dad's former
Clach team-mate, Dons' striker Duncan Shearer.
Then his other son, Paul, 17, was picked as junior side Dingwall
Thistle's player of the year.
Don formed the syndicate with seven fellow electricians from Barmac's
fabrication yard at Nigg.
He said: ''I couldn't believe it. I'm just waiting for the bubble to
burst.I have never won anything in my life. The syndicate started only
eight weeks ago, although I have known the rest of the lads for about 15
years.''
Don intends spending the cash on his house, garden, and a holiday.
That rules out any five-figure swoops to strengthen the Caithness club's
playing staff.

SCOTTISH Cup holders Celtic pulled in #764,000 last season from
winning the trophy.
And that figure does not include the gate money brought in for the
rounds up to the semi-final tie, when it took a replay before they got
past Hibs.
The SFA Council meeting yesterday in Glasgow was shown a breakdown of
the pay-out to all the clubs from sponsorship, radio and television, and
gate money from the semi-finals and final.
Whereas at the bottom end it meant only #875 for struggling Albion
Rovers, it was a bonanza for their neighbours, Airdrie, who got through
to the final to be beaten by Celtic.
Excluding the gate money from the early rounds, Airdrie lifted
#532,000 for their efforts.
The major part of Celtic's pay-out came from gate money of more than
#600,000 pounds from their two games in the semi-final and the final,
but was boosted by television and radio fees of almost #70,000.
The tournament was also a huge boost financially for the Highland
League's Huntly and East of Scotland club Whitehill Welfare, who won
their respective Qualifying cup competitions to get into the tournament
proper. In all Whitehill picked up #10,605 while Huntly collected
#22,927.
This season's tournament will kick off on December 9 and, following
the draw yesterday for the opening two rounds, Whitehill, who have
progressed again through this year's qualifying tournament, have the
chance to get into the third round as they have a home tie against
Fraserburgh. This, at least, will ensure a non-league side in the third
round.
Challenge Cup finalists Stenhousemuir are one of only eight teams who
have to contest the first round. They meet Arbroath, with the
opportunity of a local derby against East Stirlingshire, whom they
defeated in the first round last year, if they get past Arbroath.
Third-division leaders Livingston face a diffiuclt visit to Stranraer
but, if they advance, their manager Jim Leishman will return to
Inverness, where he was previously a manager, to face Caledonian
Thistle. Draw:
First round (ties on December 9) Stenhousemuir v Arbroath, Glasgow
University v Spartans, Albion Rovers v Deveronvale, Stranraer v
Livingston.
Second round (January 6) -- Ayr United v Ross County, Forfar v
Lossiemouth, East Stirlingshire v Stenhousemuir or Arbroath, Glasgow
University or Spartans v East Fife, Albion Rovers or Deveronvale v
Keith, Montrose v Cowdenbeath, Caledonian Thistle v Stranraer or
Livingston, Whitehill Welfare v Fraserburgh, Clyde v Brechin, Queen of
the South v Queen's Park, Stirling Albion v Alloa, Berwick v Annan.
* DUNFERMLINE have their eye on Hearts' George Wright. The 25-year-old
midfielder was given a try-out in the reserves against Livingston last
night.
''He has just accepted a free from Hearts,'' said Fifers' manager Bert
Paton, ''and he is a definite prospect for us if his performance comes
up to expectations.''
Dundee, Barnsley, and Hamilton are also interested in Wright.

TONY BLAIR yesterday kept his promise to create a new-look Opposition
team, most of whom could find themselves in Government in 18 months,
when he promoted eighteen new faces -- MPs who entered the Commons in
the 1992 election or after -- as Front Bench spokesmen.
He also named a record number of women, 15, with four more in an
almost entirely remodelled Whips' office.
Two Scots are made spokesmen for the first time.
Mrs Helen Liddell, MP for Monklands East, the most recent arrival of
all from June last year, joins Mr John McFall (Dumbarton) and Mr John
McAllion (Dundee East) in Mr George Robertson's otherwise unchanged
Scottish team.
Mr Gordon McMaster (Paisley South) becomes deputy to Mr Tom Clarke on
disabled persons' rights.
Mrs Liddell said: '' I am very happy and I am am obviously anxious to
serve both my party and the country to the best of my abilities. I am
very conscious that I am the most junior member of the team. It's a big
gamble on Tony Blair's part, and I've now got to live up to it.''
One Scot is among the nine MPs leaving the Front Bench, Mr Martin
O'Neill, MP for Clackmannan (50), the Energy spokesman, who has shadowed
variously Scotland, Defence -- where he was the principal spokesman --
and Trade and Industry.
There are moves for Mr Brian Wilson (Cunninghame North) from Trade and
Industry to Transport, Mr Henry McLeish (Central Fife) from Transport to
Health, Mr Adam Ingram (East Kilbride) from Social Security to Trade and
Industry and Mr Lewis Moonie (Kirkcaldy) from Trade and Industry to
National Heritage.
Scots spokesmen who stay put are Dr John Reid (Motherwell North) --
now number two at Defence -- Mr Tony Worthington (Clydebank and
Milngavie) -- Northern Ireland -- Mr Nigel Griffiths (Edinburgh South)
-- Trade and Industry -- and Mr Alastair Darling (Edinburgh Central) --
Treasury -- and Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) --
Overseas Development.
Mr Eric Clarke (Midlothian) remains as Scottish whip, surviving what
amounts to a revolution in the Whips' office, as Mr Don Dixon (66), the
deputy Chief Whip since 1987 and Mr Ray Powell (67), the influential
pairing whip both depart in favour of Blair appointees Mr Nick Brown, MP
for Newcastle-Upon-Tyne East (45) and Mr George Mudie (50) MP for Leeds
East -- appointed a whip only last year -- who moves into the number
three position.
Mr Blair is expecting the new Social Security team headed by Mr Chris
Smith -- who took over from Mr Donald Dewar, now Chief Whip -- to come
up with radical ideas based in part on the work of the Social Justice
Commission set up by the late John Smith. These could include involving
private insurance in complementing state provision.
Mr Blair's conviction that the information super highway will prove to
be a major economic tool is symbolised by his transferring the new
spokesman Mr Geoff Hoon, MP for Ashfield, to the Trade and Industry team
away from National Heritage.
The new Front Bencher responsible for women's issues is Ms Tessa
Jowell, MP for Dulwich, promoted from the Whips office.
Apart from Mr O'Neill, Labour MPs no longer on the Front Bench are: Mr
Martyn Jones (Agriculture), Ms Joan Walley (Transport), Mr Robin Corbett
(Disabled People's Rights), Mrs Maria Fyfe (Scotland), Mr David
Hinchliffe (Health) and Mr Donald Anderson (law officer).
Mr Eric Martlew has been moved from Labour's Defence team to the
Whips' office.
New faces in the whips' office include: Janet Anderson, Ann Coffey,

Mr Peter Hain, who won a by-election in 1991, was also rewarded with
promotion. The left-winger, who has been a critic of Mr Blair's
modernisation of Labour -- but is respected for his assiduous
parliamentary work -- was made an Opposition whip.

AS THE Scottish Grand Committee neared the end of its historic first
meeting in Aberdeen, Conservative Phil Gallie said he looked forward to
Ayr being chosen as a future meeting place.
The Gaiety Theatre, perhaps as a warm-up for Johnnie Beattie, might be
a suitable venue in Ayr because it was an entertaining spectacle, if
nothing else.
It seemed surprising that, on such an important occasion, more than
half of Scotland's 72 MPs failed to turn up at the Town and County Hall
for the committee, but then perhaps they had the benefit of experiencing
previous meetings of the committee with no power. It debates but takes
no decisions.
At the very outset, SNP leader Alex Salmond suggested that the debate
on Competitiveness in the Scottish Economy might have been better
attended if the committee had powers.
However, most MPs cited travel difficulties as the main obstacle to
their attendance, which would have come as something of a puzzle to the
North-east community who are well-used to making it in time for Central
Belt meetings.
There were enough to start the show, and at 10.30am chairman Norman
Hogg invited Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to kick off. He did so
by painting a glowing picture of Scotland's economy under the
Conservative Government.
Mr Forsyth claimed that Labour's plans for a minimum wage would result
in ''a million job losses for Scotland'' and said a minimum wage of
about #4 an hour would create a ''jobs holocaust'' and be fundamentally
damaging to Scotland's prosperity.
The Scottish Secretary also branded Labour guilty of dishonesty for
refusing to reveal at what level it would set the minimum wage.
''It is dishonest politics not to say what the wage would be until
after a General Election and not give a figure to many of those employed
who would lose their jobs,'' he said.
It was hoped the Scottish Secretary might liven proceedings by making
some major announcement, but his only revelation was that he himself
would lead the UK party at this week's crucial European Fisheries
Committee -- the first time a Scottish Secretary has done so since
George Younger.
He said the Government shared concerns over the fishing industry and
would raise the issues with the European body.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson attacked the Tories'
privatisation policies, but Mr Forsyth retaliated by claiming that if a
Scottish assembly had tax-raising powers -- the ''tartan tax'' -- it
would destroy jobs.
The public seats were busy. It seemed there were many interested
Aberdonians keen to hear the verbal jousting of Scotland's politicians.
However, it transpired that the majority were members of the group
campaigning to have a by-pass built on the A96 around Fochabers, the
subject of a 30-minute adjournment debate at the close of the Grand
Committee.
A smart gentleman with a starched shirt and bow-tie explained the
proceedings to them as they held up their ''Fochabers By-Pass Now''
posters for the benefit of the TV cameras prior to the start of the
proceedings.
The same smart gentleman had it pointed out to a radio reporter that
it was unacceptable to lean too far over the balcony of the Minstrel's
Gallery, where the press were stationed, even if he was only looking for
a story.
It was, however, quite acceptable for the MPs to make strange noises
when the opposition was speaking.
Local MP Raymond Robertson, possibly feeling additional responsibility
with a ''home game,'' was the man of the match.
He greeted virtually every Conservative remark with a deep ''hear,
hear,'' but when Labour, SNP and Liberal Democrats were speaking he
continually made unintelligible derisory noises. They were unconcerned
and carried on making their notes and reading their magazines and
newspapers and popping in and out of the room.
Eventually the MPs turned to strong drink. This was the specialist
subject of Labour MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun William McKelvey.
He urged the Scottish Secretary to give the Chancellor ''a dig in the
ribs'' to encourage him to cut the tax by 50p in the Budget -- the 24p
he put on in a ''fit of pique and vindictiveness'' following the
Government's defeat on VAT and fuel, and another 26p to make it ''a nice
round figure.'' He said as a result of the additional tax whisky sales
were dropping, and the Government already had lost #1m in revenue. In
addition, jobs were being lost.
He then revealed that, because of low tax on spirits, in Italy a
bottle of Johnny Walker Red Label which costs #14 in Britain could be
bought for #5.83 there, Chivas Regal was half price at #12.25 and a
bottle of Teacher's could be had for #5.42, instead of #11.25.
Mr McKelvey said that huge quantities of spirits were being taken in
from Italy for personal use by people organising Highland weddings and
there was an extraordinary number of Highland weddings taking place at
the moment.
His tax cut call was backed yesterday by Liberal Democrat Treasury
spokesman Malcolm Bruce, who said it was ''time to end the ludicrous
situation whereby we tax home-produced whisky at twice the rate of
foreign-produced champagne.
In his closing address, Scottish Industry Minster George Kynoch
disclosed that Mr Forsyth, in fact, had had a meeting with the Scotch
Whisky Association and if he had not given the Chancellor a dig in the
ribs he had at least made its views known to him.
After lunch and a meeting of the Scottish Affairs Committee -- which
is taking evidence on the future of Scottish agriculture --  the MPs
headed for London for debate and voting.

THE Scottish Secretary had some good news yesterday for the
campaigners for a bypass for Kintore in Aberdeenshire.
At a meeting with representatives of the Kintore and District
Community Council, he told them that he had approved the construction of
a bypass for their town but as yet no date has been fixed for its
construction.
''The A96 is a key link in the trunk road network and we have been
implementing a highly successful Action Plan to improve the level of
service,'' he said. ''The Kintore bypass is the latest scheme to receive
approval and when complete will ease congestion and signifcantly improve
the environment in Kintore.

LABOUR warned yesterday that it will bring the three companies which
are to own the country's railway rolling stock under the control of the
Rail Regulator to ''prevent them holding the rest of the industry to
ransom.''
With an announcement imminent on the sale of the companies, rail
spokesman Brian Wilson said at Commons Question Time it would be a
''monstrous fraud on the taxpayer'' if the three companies were sold for
as little as #1.5bn, which he claimed was around half their true value.
Mr Wilson said the turnover of the three companies last year was
#800m, with a profit of #450m.
They would have a guaranteed income stream for eight years.
His commitment confirms that Labour does not intend to renationalise
every part of the industry sold off before an election, but is aimed at
constraining the expectations of potential investors in the
rolling-stock companies which, he claimed, had attracted fewer bids than
the Government had hoped for.
In her debut Commons appearance as Shadow Transport Secretary, Clare
Short warned the House: ''I do warn anyone contemplating bidding for any
part of the rail network that there will be no gravy train for the fat
cats out of this one, and that Labour intends that the rail system
should remain in public ownership.''
She protested that information provided to City analysts on the sale
of Railtrack was so inadequate they could not properly value it, and she
challenged Transport Secretary Sir George Young: ''Will you give a
solemn undertaking that it will not be sold cheaply before the election
just in order to fund Tory tax cuts?''
He replied: ''We have not speculated about the proceeds that will be
secured, but, of course, a full prospectus will be published in due
course for those who are seeking to invest in Railtrack.''
To Tory cheers he demanded: ''How will you pay for your policy of
buying back the railways?
''Will it be higher fares, higher taxes or higher borrowing?''

THE Scottish National Party plans to put the protection of the
environment at the top of the political agenda by focusing on it today
in its special supply day debate in the Commons, (writes Graeme Smith).
Announcing the topic for the debate prior to yesterday's Scottish
Grand Committee meeting in Aberdeen, the party's Environment spokeswoman
Ms Roseanna Cunningham said the last few months had seen Scotland
bombarded with environmental threats.
Scotland was facing yet another nuclear threat, she claimed, with the
prospect of Dounreay accepting reprocessing contracts.
''The prospect of between 5000 and 15,000 radioactive fuel rods being
trundled across Scottish roads is a matter about which the people of
Scotland are gravely concerned.
''The greater the concentration of nuclear material in Scotland the
greater the possibility there will be a nuclear accident in Scotland.
''The environmental impact of such an accident does not bear
contemplation and there is also the potential damage to Scottish
industries such as fishing, farming, food processing, whisky and
tourism, which are vitally dependent on a public perception of a clean
environment,'' she said.
She also said that Westminster's past disregard for the environment
appeared to be coming back to haunt those living on Scotland's South-
west coast, with more than a million tons of munitions having been
dumped in Beaufort's Dyke by the Ministry of Defence and now thousands
of phosphorus devices being washed up along the shore.

BUCKINGHAM Palace and the Government last night were accused of
''obstructing'' an MP's search for information about ''the grandest
housing benefit scheme ever devised''.
Labour former Minister Alan Williams told the Commons: ''What worries
me is the obstruction I feel one gets from the Department of National
Heritage and from the Palace itself in just trying to obtain
information.''
For example, he had been unable to discover whether 46 senior members
of the Royal Household who he said enjoyed ''very lavish''
grace-and-favour accommodation were full or part-time staff, and what
their job descriptions were.
Some of his constituents were having to ''survive'' on housing benefit
and others ''to sign away their homes in order to get care in old age'',
he said.
Yet he was ''not allowed to get information I need about people living
in the grandest housing benefit scheme that anyone has ever devised''.

* MINISTERS were yesterday forced to acknowledge health inequalities
between rich and poor after a report from their own officials.
The study reveals the scale of variations and accused Health
Department officials of failing to address the problem.
The report draws together research highlighting differences in life
expectancy between social classes.
1 Among the differences are:
* Life expectancy at birth is around seven years higher for social
class one than social class five;
* Children in social class five are four times more likely to suffer
accidental death;
* Of 66 major causes of death in men, 62 were more common in social
classes four and five.
The study reveals while both sexes can expect to live longer,
differences remain between all the regions.
It calls on the Department of Health to:
* Take the lead in arguing for health promotion policies, especially
for those who suffer the worst health;
* Allocate resources to reflect need;
* Set targets for reducing health variations;
* Make reducing the variations in health a priority in the NHS.

SALES of unit trusts were hit last month by investors opening building
society accounts in the hope of receiving bonuses on a merger or
flotation, it was revealed yesterday.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds said the evidence
of investors hunting for bonuses coincided with building society figures
showing net inflows in September were at the second highest level this
year.
Net sales to private investors of unit trusts fell last month to #218m
from #276m in August, which was a particularly good month for sales.
However, net sales of personal equity plans (PEPs) climbed from #243m
in August to #279m last month and sales of corporate bond PEPs which
were introduced early in the summer are growing quickly.
The number of corporate bond PEP accounts has risen from 4000 in July
to 30,000 in September.

<TEXT>
AN ''overwhelming majority'' of Royal Navy personnel are opposed to
gays being allowed in the Services, the Ministry of Defence said last
night.
A spokesman confirmed that surveys of ''all ranks and ratings'' had
shown strong support for the ban on homosexuals to be continued.
She said the results of the survey would form part of a report to be
submitted to the Government on the issue of gays in the services.
Reports last night suggested as many as 90% of officers and ratings
quizzed on the topic had expressed opposition but the MoD spokesman
stressed it was not the ministry's policy to release exact details of
figures.
She admitted the survey, conducted in August after a judicial review
into the ban on gays was granted, had shown strong support for the
policy.
''I have no details about how many but certainly the Navy did take
soundings of its personnel and, of those asked, there was an
overwhelming majority against relaxation of the current rules.''
The report will follow the announcement by a High Court judge that he
did not believe the policy could survive much longer.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo and his advisers are reluctant to
lift the ban, despite heavy lobbying by gay rights activists, unless
there is strong support from within the services.

PRICES for Aberdeen Angus bulls yesterday were the best for many years
on the opening day of the annual October bull sales in Perth.
Strong bidding from commercial buyers was the feature of the sale and
this lifted the average to #2930.13 for 67 compared to #2601.25 last
year when only 42 were sold.
Top price of 12,000 guineas went to the fifth prize April 1994 Golatio
of Haymount from J&amp;W Arnott, Haymount, Kelso, selling to near-neighbours
TH Brewis, Eastfield of Lempitlaw, Kelso.
The next best at 7000 guineas was the intermediate champion, the March
1994 Carlhurlie Deceiver from Rae Grieve, Carlhurlie, Lundin Links,
Fife, which sold to Alex McLaren, Warren, Croughton, North Hants.
The unplaced January 1994 Proud Marbevax of Humbie, from Elizabeth
Bayne-Jardine, Humbie Mains, Gifford, sold at 6000 guineas to Campbell
Graham, Auchinek, Drymen.
Also selling at 6000 guineas was the third prize April 1994 Evergreat
T45 of Blelack, from Neil Massie, Blelack, Dinnet, Aberdeenshire, which
went to Wootton Farms Ltd, Stoke on Trent.
Again at 6000 guineas Lord and Lady Glendyne, Craigeassie, Forfar,
sold their reserve intermediate champion, the March 1994 Hurdcott Bonzo,
to Stewart Macphie, Glenbervie Home Farm, Stonehaven.
Several bulls went to Orkney with the most expensive being the 5000
guineas paid by Scott Hurcus, Quanterness, Kirkwall for a second prize
bull from Mrs JRL Campbell, Wedderlie, Gordon, while Duncan McLaren from
Netherton sold his senior champion at the same price to Stephen Ball,
Knockhill, Banchory. The overall champion from Lord and Lady Glendyne
made a more modest 3500 guineas to GN Farr, Greenknowe, Gordon.
Angus heifers sold to 4600 guineas for the champion from Bon Lea
Angus, Hornby Grange, North Allerton, Yorkshire, to Andrew Mylius, St
Fort, Newport on Tay, who also paid 4000 guineas for one from HM The
Queen Mother. The 11 Angus heifers, averaged #2214.15 -- up #502.24.

ONE of Scotland's biggest firms of livestock auctioneers have axed

programme.
The directors of Lawrie &amp; Symington Ltd, who operate markets at
Lanark, Biggar, Edinburgh and Peebles, announced yesterday that they had
decided to dispose of the post of group managing director and that Ian M
Thomson had been made redundant.
A statement issued by the company said: ''The directors, in the course
of restructuring the company have decided to dispose with the post of
group managing director. It is therefore with regret that Ian M Thomson
has been made redundant.''
Day-to-day running of the Lanark and Biggar markets will be controlled
by Hunter Murray and the Edinburgh and Peebles operations will now be
managed by Dugald Hamilton.
Earlier this year the company succeeded in warding off a take over bid
by the Edinburgh investment company Caledonian Trust.

THE Government last night defended the proposals it will put to the
European Fisheries Council on Thursday, aimed at limiting the access for
Spanish fishing vessels to western waters off the British Isles from
January.
Tory Euro-rebels, six of whom tabled an amendment -- not selected for
a vote -- calling for Britain's withdrawal from the Common Fisheries
Policy, pressed Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry on their demand, and
later some of them abstained on a motion backing Government policy.
Mr Baldry told the House that there would be new arrangements for
monitoring the movements of vessels at sea, and emphasised there would
be no overall increase of fishing effort in western waters.
Most importantly, access to the Irish Box would be limited to a
maximum of 40 vessels at any one time.
In the face of all-party criticism of what is being proposed, Mr
Baldry said the proposals which would be put to the Fisheries Council --
where he will have the support of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth --
were ''sensible and proportionate to what needs to be achieved.''
He said: ''I fully appreciate that earlier in the year our fishing
industries quite rightly were opposed to the Commission's proposals,
which they saw as being bureaucratic, burdensome and costly.
''I am sure they now recognise -- and I hope the House will recognise,
that I and other Fisheries Ministers throughout Europe have been able to
move matters some considerable distance during the summer months.
''Given the objectives we have to meet, I believe that these place the
minimum of extra regulation on the UK fishing industry, consistent with
the need I am sure is recognised throughout all parts of this House, to
ensure that Spain's involvement in the Irish Box is properly monitored
and supervised.''
Labour's fisheries spokesman Elliot Morley attacked the Government for
failing to secure a satisfactory agreement on the future access of
Spanish and Portuguese vessels.
Leading the attack by Tory Euro-sceptic MPs, Sir Teddy Taylor
(Southend East) said: ''On fishing and everything else, we should
appreciate that democracy is dying and all these assurances the Minister
gives, with great sincerity, to the fishermen are one great joke.''
Fellow Tory Euro-sceptic Teresa Gorman (Billericay) said there had
been appeasement over the deal to let Spanish vessels in. She said: ''we
must take the bull by the horns and insist that our British waters are
regained for our own fishermen.
''It is possible to do anything if you have the will. If we insist, we
can make sure we police our waters and keep out the marauding Spanish
fleets.''
The Liberal Democrats' spokesman, Scottish leader Jim Wallace,
questioned what the legal position would be if a 41st Spanish vessel
appeared in British waters, while Labour MP Calum Macdonald (Western
Isles) said: ''Given the ability of Spanish boats to evade rules and
regulations, our fishermen are very fearful indeed of what the real
impact will be of Spanish access.''
Labour's call for tighter controls was defeated by 236 votes to 150, a
Government majority of 86.
A Government motion noting the plans for CFP controls and backing
''the Government's efforts to secure effective measures to monitor and
enforce fishing activity in western waters'', was carried by 233 votes
to 152, a Government majority 81.
Sir Teddy said later he had abstained in the vote on the Government's
motion and believed none of the other five had supported the Government.

<TEXT>
GLASGOW Laabour MP George Galloway last night accused the Kuwaiti
royal family of being like a Mafia-style ''family''.
Mr Galloway (Hillhead) told the Commons that Kuwait's rulers were
presiding over human rights atrocities.
During a debate on Britain's relations with the oil-rich Gulf state,
he claimed two Kuwaiti princesses had ''ruined'' businessmen in London
by abandoning a property deal.
Mr Galloway, who has come under fire in the past over his stance on
Iraq, told the House that ''internal repression'' and ''lack of basic
human rights and democracy'' in Kuwait were legendary.
''Of all the human rights atrocities committed by the ruling family in
Kuwait, the very worst, and the greatest, is against the people known as
the Bedoons.''
The Bedoons were Kuwaiti natives. He said half of them, 150,000, had
been ''driven'' into refugee camps in the Iraqi desert while the other
half were treated as non-citizens, with no rights.
Mr Galloway condemned what he claimed was the deportation from Kuwait
of ''hundreds of thousands'' of Palestinians, Sudanese and Yemenis.
He said: ''I could detain the House with the tales from the casinos
and bordellos of London which are legendary, about this rapacious family
with more money than sense, and fewer morals than the pounds in their
pockets.''
He then focused on the case of London businessman Mr F Salus, whose
case he had raised in a Commons motion earlier this year.
''Mr Salus was absolutely ruined by the decision of two princesses of
the Kuwaiti royal house, Princesses Nadia and Fatemah Al-Sabah, who
commissioned him and other British contractors to renovate flats in
Kensington in London and who, midway through the contract, without
warning, liquidated their limited liability company and walked away from
their liabilities to these British contractors, ruining all of them,''
Mr Galloway said. ''Some of them died. Marriages broke up. All suffered
terrible hardship as a result of this dreadful decision.''
Mr Galloway said the UK Government should press Kuwait to pay the
debt. Mr Salus was owed #75,400.
Replying, Foreign Office Minister of State Jeremy Hanley said of the
Salus case: ''We cannot intervene in a commercial dispute of this
nature, which should be pursued through the courts.''
He said: ''We are concerned about a number of human rights issues in
Kuwait. We welcome the fact that the Kuwaiti government permits
international human rights organisations to visit Kuwait and conduct
field work there.''

<HEADLINE>Two jailed for kicking to death oil worker</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO men were each jailed for three years yesterday after being found
guilty of kicking an offshore worker to death outside a chip shop.
Gary Foy, 23, and James Gordon, 22, had originally been charged with
murdering oil worker Paul McQueen, 29, from Gourock, Renfrewshire.
At the High Court in Stonehaven yesterday, they were found guilty of
the lesser charge of culpable homicide by a jury of nine men and six
women.
Foy, of Townhead Road, Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, was also found guilty
of assaulting welder Lance Stevenson, 31, a friend of Mr McQueen.
Foy and Gordon, also of Townhead Road, showed no emotion when the
verdict was read out.
Judge Lord Johnston said: ''It is a tragedy that you find yourselves
in this situation.''
He also said the fact that Gordon was a first offender heightened the
''tragedy of the position he finds himself in''. However, he added: ''It
is equally a tragedy that in a fleeting moment of drunken stupidity a
man's life was lost.''
The judge said that in sentencing the pair to three years each he was
taking into account both their ages and the hope that the experience
would act as a salutary lesson.
The court had earlier heard how the pair had repeatedly kicked and
punched Mr McQueen on the head and body. University of Aberdeen
pathologist Dr James Grieve told the court that Mr McQueen had died
after choking to death on his own blood.
The forensic evidence revealed that traces of Mr McQueen's blood were
found on Gordon's clothes and shoes and on Foy's shoes.
The drunken attack happened in June this year outside a chip shop in
Aberdeen's Exchange Street.
Foy and Gordon were arrested when shopkeeper Graham Stephen, 40,
spotted them beating up Mr McQueen and followed them when they ran away.
Mr Stephen kept in touch with the police over his mobile phone and the
pair were picked up minutes later.

<HEADLINE>Safety fears for Irish Deputy PM at historic visit on the anniversary of Shankill IRA bombing. Spring meets with fringe loyalists</HEADLINE>

IRISH Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring last night called off a
historic visit to Belfast's loyalist Shankill Road because of fears for
his safety.
Mr Spring had been due to meet members of the fringe loyalist
Progressive Unionist Party -- which is linked to the Ulster Volunteer
Force -- for talks at their Shankill Road offices on the second
anniversary of the Shankill Road bombing.
Tension in the area was running high following a parade in north
Belfast on Sunday night in memory of Thomas Begley, the IRA terrorist
who died while planting the bomb which killed nine Protestants in the
infamous fish shop bombing.
Irish Government officials said that until Sunday night the Shankill
meeting had been set to go ahead but advice was received yesterday that
the RUC could not guarantee Mr Spring's safety.
The RUC denied giving any specific advice that Mr Spring should not go
to the area.
The meeting was rescheduled and held in a central Belfast hotel.
Earlier, Mr Spring had more than 75 minutes of talks with Ulster
Unionist Party leader David Trimble at Unionist headquarters in the
heart of Belfast.
The two men had been sniping at each other in advance of the meeting
over the decommissioning of IRA weapons.
Mr Trimble at the weekend accused Mr Spring of being ''cavalier'' in
attitude to the weapons issue and said he had changed his stance from
one of calling for an IRA handover of weapons in advance of Sinn Fein's
entry to all-party talks, to one of being against decommissioning before
the talks.
After their meeting, the two men tried to smooth over the differences
and said they had a good discussion and looked forward to further talks.
Twelve months ago, even six months ago, the idea of a leading Irish
Government Minister visiting the Belfast HQ of the Unionists would have
been a non-starter. Whatever their continuing differences, that
yesterday's meeting took place at all is a sign of the changed times.
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams last night called on David Trimble to
''set aside all excuses for not entering into an inclusive political
process''.
Ignoring the decommissioning issue, Mr Adams said it was time for
unionists to engage with republicans and everyone else.
He said the objective would be to ''develop new ideas, seeking new
agreements and accommodations and breaking old taboos and fears''.
''Mr Trimble must show courage in leading his section of our people
into a new agreement. Courage is not the absence of fear but the triumph
over it.
''Mr Trimble can either work with the rest of us in making change our
friend and turning it to our collective advantage.
''Or he can try to hold back the tide of history or seek to minimise
the change. In essence, this would mean unionists once again failing the
real democratic test.''

The best-laid open
plans . . . but
along with the
teething troubles
Dick Louden finds
some satisfaction
among pupils and
staff with the
replacement (right)
for the troubled
Kilbowie Primary
School building
in Clydebank (left)
Without walls: the new building's open-plan design, with no obvious
dividing partitions between class bases, encourages teachers to
cooperate
OVER the summer the old asbestos-lined building of Kilbowie Primary
School in the Radnor Park area of Clydebank was demolished, and in
August staff and pupils moved a few metres across the playground into
their brand new open-plan school.
Designed to a capacity of 396 pupils, its roll already stands at 347
and head teacher Sheila Campbell expects it to jump to 368 next year.
''The school was built with 12 class bases,'' she said. ''With a
composite grouping at Primary 4/5 we already have 13 classes and next
August it will rise to 14. We are having to adjust to accommodate the
extra classes.''
A new school like Kilbowie -- which will be officially opened in
February -- offers tremendous advantages. Everything is new, not only
the building itself but also all the furnishings and equipment.
The sheer newness breeds a pride and a sense of ownership. The
open-plan design, with no permanent partitions between class bases,
encourages cooperation between teachers and the sharing of expertise.
Early next year work will start on a new purpose-built nursery unit just
across the campus.
The temporary downside is that teething problems are inevitable. For
instance, the ''mezzanine'', the raised area with computer
work-stations, is not yet in use because the worktops are too high, even
for adults, and not deep enough. They will be replaced at additional
expense.
Some problems will have to be coped with over the longer term. The
dining area is of restricted size and, inconveniently for both visitors
and pupils at lunch, is entered directly through the school's front
door.
The activity areas, used mainly for art and for sand and water play,
double as circulation areas and the through traffic can be distracting.
The mobile coat trolleys become very cluttered and younger children
often need help in hanging up their coats.
Storage areas, though attractive and handily located, do not meet the
school's total needs and major items like dining tables, PE equipment
and the coat trolleys intrude into teaching spaces.
These problems of space are not unique to Kilbowie and the school will
learn to adapt to them. Indeed, Sheila Campbell makes the point that
both staff and pupils have adjusted very quickly. ''For the children it
is a good preparation for life,'' she says.
''After all, more and more offices are open-plan nowadays. Our parents
think we are lucky to have such superb equipment. We held an open day
for them -- 200 came along, we had 60 children in our creche and the
feedback was very positive.''
The response from the parent body has been highly supportive. The
school has long had an active Parent Teacher Association -- now, for the
first time, it has a school board as well.
''The initiative came from the parents,'' says Mrs Campbell. ''They
were also wonderful in the help they gave us in packing for the
transfer. We had 500 packing boxes and we simply couldn't have managed
without the parents.''
Depute head Rebecca Murdoch was in charge of the cataloguing procedure
which preceded the transfer of materials. ''We jam-packed the old school
because it had so many cupboards,'' she says. ''Knowing we were moving
to more condensed storage, we did a lot of weeding out. One rule of
thumb was that textbooks more than 10 years old were cleared out.''
Now she claims that ''I hardly even remember being in a different
building. The staff have coped wonderfully and they work closely
together. In the old school people would work late but there was little
interaction to solve problems.''
The process of preparing the staff began three years ago and they have
been working in pairs to make them ready for their new situation.
Because of the open-plan nature of the school, joint planning and the
programming of work spaces like the activity areas and the ''studio''
(the audio-visual room) have been adopted.
The school has now also introduced ERIC (Enjoy Reading In Class),
under which the half-hour after lunch is devoted to personal reading by
the children, though at Primary 1 and 2 the teachers read out stories to
their classes.
Even the janitor looks a happy man. ''The new building makes life a
lot easier,'' says John McArthur, ''though at the moment I spend a lot
of my time on the phone dealing with building problems.
''Vandalism has been cut down dramatically -- we have only had one
smashed window, which caused our very effective alarm system to go
off.''
In open-plan schools, noise levels are a constant topic of interest.
''Initially I was horrified,'' says teacher Johanna McClelland. ''It's
not a behaviour problem. I just think that from Primary 4 upwards pupils
find it easier to adjust their sound levels.''
She praises the ''excellent'' management support: ''You feel part of a
team. This is a great staff now for exchanging ideas.''
Senior teacher David Mitchison feels that ''noise levels go up and
down but I've managed to build a good relationship with the children''.
He is ''enjoying the newness'' but admits to missing the spontaneity --
''It has to be very structured; you can't just decide to stop and have a
song''.
Children offer some of the sharpest reactions. ''I prefer walls,''
says Ashley Austin in primary four. ''And a bigger playground -- I used
to play football in the old playground. And my dad used to go running
with Mr McArthur, the janitor.''
Andrew Cameron in primary six lays out the pros and cons succinctly.
''The old school was bigger and the dinner hall had better seats. Here
we have brand new carpets, a louder fire bell, cleaner toilets and
better food. I had delicious steak pie on Friday.''
Yousuf Hussain in primary seven misses the old school. ''I was there a
long time. Here there's not so much space to put your work up on the
walls. I miss the old dining hall -- it was away from the main door.
''But I love the new equipment and it's good having two teachers. If
you put your hand up, you can get help at any time.''
Stephanie Barr, also in primary seven, regrets that ''there's no
privacy when you're changing for gym, and it was nice to have a separate
gym hall and assembly hall. I would like to have the old walls back. But
the toilets are higher and, even if the playground is small, we're going
to get grassed areas as well.''
Stephanie's overall verdict summed it all up: ''It looks nicer inside
and out, and it's lovely and cosy.''

GOALKEEPER John Martin is on the threshold of yet another Frank
Sinatra-style final farewell.
After featuring in the Tennents Scottish Cup showpiece in May when
Airdrie were beaten 1-0 by Celtic, Martin is on the verge of another
Hampden appearance.
''People keep saying I'm making my farewell appearance but now I've
got another last chance,'' laughed Martin.
''I will be 37 on Friday, so to reach the final would be a great
birthday present. We are hoping it will be third time lucky, because
we've been in the semi-finals twice in this cup and lost both on
penalties.''
Homeless Airdrie, who are still sharing Clyde's Broadwood Stadium, are
going into their fifth major semi-final in five years.
''We are excited about it. People say we might have been better
playing Aberdeen or Rangers, but I say the draw was kind to both us and
Dundee,'' added Martin.
''We feel we let ourselves down slightly in the Scottish Cup final
when we lost to Celtic. It was a real opportunity for us but we didn't
play as we can.''
Martin has no thoughts of retirement even though he turned full-time
only when into his late twenties.
''I've worked as a labourer and a miner so going full-time as a
footballer was tremendous. Packing it in hasn't crossed my mind. I'd
only consider it if I lost my desire, and that's not the case,'' he
explained.
0* CHALLENGE Cup finalists Stenhousemuir can expect their supporters
to turn out in unusually large numbers tonight for a reserve match.
The Larbert club are putting tickets on sale for that final against
Dundee United at their Reserve League West game against Stirling Albion.
The tickets are priced #9 for the main stand and #7 for the Ormond
stand at McDiarmid Park, while there also is a #2 concession ticket for
juveniles who are accompanied by an adult.
However, the Warriors' fans can expect to be outnumbered, for United
have 8000 tickets for the 10,500-capacity stadium.

<HEADLINE>Work permit for Juninho</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MIDDLESBROUGH'S new #4.75m Brazilian star Juninho has been granted a
work permit, the Football Association said last night.
FA spokesman Steve Double said: ''All that remains is for
Middlesbrough to obtain international clearance, which will involve
negotiations between them and the Brazilian federation. That should take
a day or two.''
The news comes as a boost to 'Boro manager Bryan Robson, who wants
Juninho to make his debut against Manchester United at Old Trafford on
Saturday.
On the assumption that all the red tape is cleared up, 'Boro have
already sold more than 6000 tickets to fans wishing to see live coverage
of the match on a giant screen at their Riverside Stadium.
After a carnival welcome by 'Boro fans last week, Teesside's newest
sporting hero returned to Brazil, where he has been tying up loose ends
while waiting for the work permit to be processed.
Robson has been sweating on news from the Department of Employment and
said yesterday that Juninho would need to be back in Britain by tomorrow
morning to have any chance of facing United.
He explained: ''Juninho would need to get a good night's sleep to
recover from jet-lag and train with the rest of the lads on Thursday and
Friday.''
Meanwhile, Manchester United supporters think the club have scored an
own goal by clamping down on fans who leap to their feet during play at
Old Trafford.
The Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA) wants
the club to introduce ''cheering zones'' where fans can chant, sing, and
stand to celebrate goals without being under threat.
Last season United issued ultimatums to over-zealous fans to sit down
or get out.
The supporters' group are concerned about the drop in atmosphere at
Old Trafford and have sent the club more than 20 suggestions of how to
improve things.
Last week the club announced its own plans to readmit visiting
supporters during current building work to help improve the atmosphere.

DUNDEE have been given a huge boost on the eve of the Coca-Cola Cup
semi-final clash with Airdrie, as French goalkeeper Michel Pageaud
revealed he could say ''Oui'' to a new deal at Dens Park.
The 29-year-old keeper, who faces first-division rivals Airdrie at
McDiarmid Park tomorrow night, had been expected to walk out on the
Taysiders at the end of the season.
In fact, Dundee fans already count themselves lucky to have Pageaud in
the squad this season, after he almost stayed home in France in the
summer.
The problem arose near the end of last season when his wife Natalie
left Scotland with the couples' two children because she could not
settle here. When their third child, son Theo, was born, the keeper's
future at Dens Park was thrown into further doubt.
But Pageaud revealed last night: ''My wife phoned last week to say she
is coming back to Scotland on November 1. We have rented a house and the
whole family will be together again.
''That is important for me, because I have only seen my son three
times since he was born in the summer.
''The situation has never affected my form, because I have my job to
do here and I must concentrate on that. But it could change my feelings
about the future.
''I wanted to find a club in France in the close season. The only
people playing abroad who are mentioned in the papers back home are
Papin, Ginola, and Cantona.
''When we are back together as a family I will have more options for
the future. I could move to another club in Scotland or find something
in England.
''But I could also stay with Dundee. I don't know what will happen but
I am much happier now that the situation has changed again.''
He added: ''We will all be together in time for the Coca-Cola Cup
final. I want to be there with Dundee and clearly the more success I
enjoy here, the better chance there is that I could stay once my
contract ends in the summer.''
Dundee won't know if there will be more good news before the big game
until they assess the fitness of Neil Duffy and Danish star Morten
Wieghorst, who were both hurt in the weekend draw with Clydebank.
Manager Jim Duffy said: ''They have both made progress and the fact
that our game is Wednesday rather than Tuesday could be decisive.
''But I am going to have to be convinced that they are 100% fit, or at
least very close to it, because this isn't going to be a match in which
we can carry anyone.
''I know all the players are desperate to take part but this is a time
when heads have to rule hearts.''
The Dens player-manager is also aware that classy midfielder Wieghorst
could be playing in his last major game for the club if he does pass
fit.
The former Lyngby star, who has won five caps for Denmark, has been
operating on monthly contracts since the start of the season and Duffy
added: ''As far as I am concerned, having him here since the start of
the season has been a bonus.
''He is a quality player and I accept it is only a matter of time
before he moves on.''

GARY Armstrong, Kenny Milne, and Glasgow Academicals' ex-Waikato coach
Kevin Greene are to join David Sole as tutors on the McEwan's
Masterclass coaching roadshow.
The Masterclass series will be held throughout November at four
geographically disparate venues so that as many clubs as possible can
make use of the expertise on offer from the coaching quartet.
The scheme co-ordinator, former Scotland and British Lions prop
forward Ian McLauchlan, said yesterday that letters had gone out to all
clubs and the intention was to have around 50 players, with an equal
split between forwards and backs present at each session. There was
provision, too, for other players and club coaches to come along and
watch.
Armstrong, who tweaked a hamstring at a Scotland squad session last
Wednesday and missed Jed-Forest's Premiership II game against West of
Scotland on Saturday, expects to be fit for Jed's game against
Stewart's-Melville on Saturday.
Yesterday, at the Masterclass launch in Edinburgh, the Scotland and
British Lions scrum half said he hoped to be able to pass on to players
at the grassroots everything that he had learned with Scotland the the
Lions.
On his latest injury he added: ''Strangely enough, I've never had a
hamstring problem before. Presumably that means that I qualify as an
athlete now.''
Milne, who will retire from competitive rugby when the Premiership
season is concluded at the end of November, said yesterday that coaching
might be a medium-term objective but the first thing he wanted to do
come the end of November was have a break from the game.
''I have picked up a lot of knowledge in my years in the game and
maybe I could use that in a coaching capacity at some point but in the
immediate short-term I am ethusiastic about this Masterclass project.
''Obviously just by turning up on the night you are not going to
improve players with the one session, but if club coaches are there as
well then they can take away what they have learned and it will be an
on-going process.''
The Masterclass evenings will take place at Aberdeen Grammar School
FP, Rubislaw (November 6); Kelso RFC, Poynder Park, Kelso (November 13);
Hillhead/Jordanhill, Hughenden, Glasgow (November 20); Preston Lodge,
Pennypit Park, Prestonpans (November 27).

LANARK'S Colin McRae, driving a Subaru Impreza 555, held fourth place
in Spain's round of the World Rally Championship when the 1660km event
halted in Lloret de Mar last night.
''I am doing just enough to keep in touch with the leading three
drivers. A top placing here will guarantee the world championship will
be decided on November's RAC Rally and that will suit me,'' said McRae.
After nine of the scheduled 23 timed special stages, run over
twisting, closed public roads, the 27-year-old former British champion
was 41 seconds behind rally leader, Finland's Juha Kankkunen, driving a
Toyota Celica.
''I'm really surprised to be leading, although I was quick here three
years ago,'' said the Finn. ''The main thing is that the car is working
perfectly.''
In second place was McRae's team-mate, Spain's Carlos Sainz, winner
here in 1992. Germany's Armin Schwarz driving a Celica is third, three
seconds ahead of McRae. The German lost time when he spun twice on
treacherously slippery roads.
In fifth place after a miserable day grappling with his ill-handling
Celica is defending world champion Didier Auriol, from France. Auriol,
McRae, Sainz, and Kankkunen are all fighting for this year's world
championship title.
Auriol said: ''We have made some changes during the day, but we must
hope that it will be better tomorrow.''
Ford hopes suffered a major setback when Belgium's Bruno Thiry broke a
front wheel bearing and retired. Team-mate Francois Delecour of France
is sixth.
Finland's Tommi Makinen dropped from sixth to ninth place after
spinning his Mitsubishi.
The three-day Costa Brava-based rally finishes at 3.30pm local time
tomorrow. Interim positions after nine of 23 special stages:
1, J Kankkunen (Finland) Toyota Celica 49min 16sec; 2, C Sainz (Spain)
Subaru Impreza at 9sec; 3, D Auriol (France) Toyota Celica 16; 4, C
McRae (Britain) Subaru Impreza 17; 5, A Schwarz (Germany) Toyota Celica

RELEASED from the special and, for professional golfers, rare
pressures of playing for a team and not just on their own account, Sam
Torrance and Colin Montgomerie this week exchange the hurly-burly of
matchplay and the satisfaction of having contributed to Scotland's
victory in the Dunhill Cup for the deeper, if more rigorous and
familiar, peace of the 72-hole strokeplay format.
Except that in this instance the occasion is far from normal. The
Volvo Masters, which begins on Thursday at Valderrama -- the site of the
next Ryder Cup match -- is the final event on the 1995 European
programme and so will decide whether Torrance or Montgomerie, or perhaps
Bernhard Langer, will win the order of merit.
This is how the lines of battle are drawn. Torrance, who has played in
25 events, leads Montgomerie, who has competed in six fewer tournaments,
by a mere #3829. Langer, first and second in the previous counting
events of the 14 he has played, has come to within #60,000 of Torrance,
a sizeable gulf but not an insurmountable one.
If Langer, who did not compete at St Andrews and who will have had
more than a week's rest before the starter's call is answered, retained
the Masters title Torrance or Montgomerie would have to finish second to
prevent the German golfer from overtaking them.
At least so far as Montgomerie is concerned the news yesterday was
encouraging.
On Sunday evening he indicated he would be consulting a specialist
yesterday about his injured left hand, sore and swollen after last
week's exertions.
In the event he did not and he flies out to Spain this morning
confident of the staying power of the appendage which his IMG manager,
Guy Kinning, described as ''the most valuable hand we have.''
The mathematical complexities and calculations remain open-ended. If
Langer finished second Torrance would have to be sixth to take the title
for the first time in 25 years of trying on the tournament grind and
Montgomerie fifth to become the first player since Severiano
Ballesteros, in 1978, to win the Harry Vardon Trophy for a third
consecutive year.
Success would earn one of them as much as #250,000 next Sunday. The
first prize is #125,000 and a sum of the same amount drawn from a bonus
pool of #500,000 goes to the winner of the money list. As it is,
Torrance has already earned some #800,000 worldwide this season and
Montgomerie almost #1m for the second successive year.
Of course, all three of them could be upstaged in the tournament.
While they are watching each other's progress a fourth party could steal
in ahead of them and what price Andrew Coltart, who made as valuable a
contribution to the Scottish victory as did his more experienced and
distinguished team-mates?
Coltart acknowledged the value to his career of being in the company
for almost a week of two such practised professionals and his
confidence, at something of a low ebb after a slack period of form had
followed a lively start to the year, is bound to have been restored.
Although winning such a prestigious tournament from a small and
exceptionally strong field might be asking a bit much from Coltart, who
has yet to win a regular European tournament, his victories last year in
the Scottish professional and Australian PGA championships were an
indication that, given the chance of victory, he is not reluctant to
take it.

STEVE Davis stayed on course yesterday for a record fourth Skoda Grand
Prix title in Sunderland with a 5-2 victory over Welshman Matthew
Stevens, but not before snooker discovered a star for the future.
Davis, now 38, turned professional when Stevens was just 12 months
old. And that cavernous gap in experience proved the youngster's undoing
after his superb start to the intriguing third-round contest.
It was by no means the first time that Davis has put an up-and-coming
player in his place but Stevens fared better than most in his first
encounter with the multiple world champion.
Stevens secured the opening two frames, with a memorable 86 clearance
in the second following an attempted three-ball plant from Davis.
But as Davis said after the match: ''Matthew just didn't do enough to
keep the pressure on.
''He's only 18 and in two or three years, with a bit more maturity, he
will be a very dangerous player. He's going to do a lot of damage to
plenty of players and I will enjoy watching him.''
Davis began his fightback by taking a scrappy third frame after
Stevens again forged into an early lead.
The fourth was a 49-minute marathon but the comeback was well and
truly on at 2-2. Davis' break of 57 in the fifth proved his highest of
the three-hour contest but he was then fortunate to go 4-2 up.
Needing the final two colours to level the match, Stevens, ranked
No.237 in the world, missed a difficult pink and the match slipped away
from him.
Davis, who nows meets Steve James on Thursday for a place in the
semi-finals, added a run of 46 to send him through to the next round.
''It's a different game playing Davis,'' said Stevens, whose
consolation is his highest pay-day of #4550. ''I have never played
anyone like that. He is brilliant at what he does.
Dublin's Fergal O'Brien earned a quarter-final clash with Stephen
Hendry by beating world No.5 James Wattana 5-3.

ALEC Stewart has been declared fit to keep wicket for England for the
first time since breaking his finger midway through last summer.
Stewart will wear the gloves during the tourists' second match in
South Africa -- a day-night contest against Eastern Transvaal at
Springs, near Johannesburg, tomorrow.
''Medical opinion is that Alec is fit to keep, he's happy to keep and
we need him to get some practice for later in the winter,'' said
chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth.
The move does not put Jack Russell's Test place under immediate
threat.
England are aiming to use their No.1 keeper throughout the five-match
series against South Africa, providing his form is good.
But Stewart is favourite to take over when the selectors start
preparing for the World Cup campaign early next year.
All 16 players will be used in the first two matches of this tour with
Russell keeping in today's opening fixture against Nicky Oppenheimer's
XI at Randjesfontein.
Stewart broke his right index finger for the third time in nine months
while keeping wicket during last summer's third Test against West Indies
at Edgbaston and did not play again all season.
England's winter itinerary:
Today: v NFO XI, Randjesfontein; tomorrow: v Eastern Transvaal,
Springs (day-night); Oct 27-30: v SA Invitation XI, Soweto.
Nov 2-5: v Border, East London; 9-12: v South Africa A, Kimberley;
16-20: First Test, Centurian Park; 23-26: v Orange Free State,
Bloemfontein; 30-Dec 4: Second Test, Johannesburg.
Dec 7-10: v Boland, Paarl; 14-18: Third Test, Durban; 20-22: v
Combined SA Universities, Pietermaritzburg; 26-30: Fourth Test, Port
Elizabeth.

<HEADLINE>Australian brewer looking for opportunities in overseas markets. Foster's poised for acquisition</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

Melbourne, Monday -- Foster's Brewing Group today said it would make a
long-awaited acquisition in the next 12 months, ending a five-year
reconstruction period that averted the Australian company's collapse.
Outgoing chairman Nobby Clark told the annual meeting the company was
looking at opportunities for growth in the beverage and related
industries in Australia and in overseas beer markets.
''I am hopeful that we will have a transaction in the next 12 months
or so,'' said Mr Clark, who stepped down at the meeting after five
years. He was replaced by director John Ralph.
Mr Clark, a former banker, has been tipped as the next chairman of
embattled retailer Coles Myer but after the meeting he declined to
comment on speculation he would be preferred by the institutional
shareholders who forced executive chairman Solomon Lew to stand down
last week.
Foster's, formerly a sprawling conglomerate known as Elders IXL, has
been selling non-brewing assets over the past five years to cut the debt
mountain which almost brought it down.
Mr Clark said the company's balance sheet, helped by the sale of the
British brewer Courage for $A1200m in August, allowed strategic
investment for growth.
The company has previously said it needs an acquisition to provide
earnings growth in the medium term until its fledgling Chinese brewing
operations start to contribute profits.
Analysts believe it can afford to spend up to $A1000m. But Foster's
has conceded it is precluded from expansion in the Australian brewing
industry because its Carlton and United Breweries United (CUB) unit, its
largest and most profitable division, already has 53% of the domestic
market.
Mr Clark, who had overseen Foster's return to financial health, said
the next step had to be a positive one. He said that once Foster's had
made an acquisition he expected the shares, which have been flat for
several years, to be re-rated and to rise.
Mr Clark said CUB's three consecutive years of double-digit profit
growth was an excellent example of management's ability to grow a
well-established business in a mature market.
''There is a process of continuous improvement and enhancement at CUB
and we expect its profit contribution to be up again this year,'' he
said.
Mr Clark said productivity continued to improve in CUB's brewing
operations and the leisure and entertainment side of the business was an
increasing contributor.
The group's brewing operations in Australia, Canada, and Britain
lifted profit 12% in the year to June 30, 1995 but Foster's group profit
was barely higher than the previous year because of increased abnormal
losses.
Foster's is about 37%-owned by steel and resources giant The Broken
Hill Pty Company, Australia's largest company. -- Reuter

THE decision to spike full Scottish athletics teams has been
reprieved, though only temporarily -- and it will depend on the Scottish
Athletic Federation being able to persuade some of the stars who have
been reluctant to pull on a Scottish vest outside Commonwealth Games in
recent years.
Ireland have agreed to host next year's Small Nations International,
and yesterday confirmed the date of June 22, subject to sufficient
funding being available. Scotland had been due to stage this match, but
opted out on financial grounds for the second successive year -- Wales
having taken over at short notice to rescue this year's fixture.
The match had already been embarrassing for the Scots, having accepted
hospitality in Tel Aviv and Istanbul. The Irish say they will now go
ahead with next year's event, against Turkey, Wales, and Scotland, and
with an Eire Select invited as guests.
SAF secretary Bob Greenoak, confirming their participation, said
Scotland would try to reciprocate by staging the match in 1997 --
subject to financial backing.
This would be for a full team, covering all events, male and female,
but Greenoak insists this does not herald a change in planned policy of
funding only small elite teams based on the Performance Management Group
lists. The introduction of this, at the expense of teams covering all
track and field disciplines, provoked outrage in many quarters when it
was revealed earlier this year.
The performance group has a separate budget, from the Scottish Sports
Council, whereas the cost of sending the team to Ireland will have to
come from existing track and field commission funds.
''Since Ireland seem to have some sponsorship, and are prepared to
take the match on, then we have agreed to compete next year,'' said
Greenoak. ''We would hope to stage the match in 1997, fulfilling our
round of obligations. Whether that would then be the end of the event
would be up to the other countries.
''Our involvement in the event will also depend on guarantees from our
top athletes that they will go. It has been a great embarrassment to
Scotland that we have often travelled with weakened teams in recent
years.''

ABERDEEN student Anna Boast, who became the first player to be sent
off in women's club rugby in Scotland, will have her case considered by
the sport's ruling body as soon as possible after the referee's report
has been submitted.
Boast was dispatched by referee Alan Forbes during the Keyline League
first division match between Edinburgh Academicals and Aberdeen
University at Raeburn Place on Sunday for allegedly ''kicking out'' at
Academicals' hooker Wendy Workman.
Maureen Sharp, of the Scottish Women's Rugby Union, said: ''We will
meet tomorrow night to appoint a neutral disciplinary panel consisting
of two SWRU members and a chairperson. We do not have set sanctions;
these can range from a caution to suspension.''
The only previous incident of this nature in Scotland occurred during
the women's world cup 18 months ago. A member of the Canadian team was
cited by England for foul play off the ball.

<HEADLINE>Hill consumed by Schumacher fears</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Damon Hill has revealed the nightmare scenario of Michael
Schumacher continuing to thwart his hopes of winning the world title.
Hill fears that Schumacher can maintain the dominance that brought him
a second title in Japan yesterday -- even though he is leaving the
sport's team of the moment.
But Hill, who saw his rival crowned Formula One king again, has vowed
he will not relent in his pursuit of the German -- even if it means a
complete remodelling of his technique. ''I could not say it is any one
thing -- it is every single aspect,'' said Hill after the 26-year-old
clinched the title with victory at the Pacific Grand Prix.
''It's mental, physical, teamwork -- the whole thing -- because
clearly Michael has an advantage over everyone. That is not acceptable
because if I want to win I will have to overhaul him on that score.''
Hill knows the superiority could be maintained, even though Schumacher
pronounced the Briton the 1996 title favourite after unveiling his #30m
switch from Benetton to the currently less-competitive Ferrari outfit.
''I do not see why Michael cannot carry that advantage to Ferrari.
They are not that uncompetitive at the moment and their V10 engine looks
promising,'' added Hill.
''I think I was stronger and better this year than I was last year.
Hopefully, I can put everything into the winter and build on that and
prepare better for next year.
''I am just going to have to adopt a stronger approach somehow. I
really believe I have got everything I need to secure the championship.
I am in the right team and have the right engine.''
Hill's fears were backed up by former Grand Prix ace John Watson, who
now observes the drivers as Eurosport's expert commentator. ''Michael is
the most complete and rounded driver around -- and he's getting
better,'' said Watson.
''Ferrari have proved in the past they can build a winning car, so if
Schumacher takes the qualities he has learned at Benetton he has to look
awfully seriously at another world championship.''
Hill knows that Schumacher is also determined to end this season in
some style with an all-out effort at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday
and the climax in Adelaide a fortnight later. Victories in both races
would enable Schumacher to break Nigel Mansell's 1992 record of nine
wins in a single season and become the first driver to notch double
figures in one campaign.

It came at the same time as Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth called

OLYMPIC champion Chris Boardman won the battle of the Britons when he
beat world champion Graeme Obree in a 4km individual pursuit yesterday,
his first major race since breaking his ankle and wrist in the Tour de
France.
But Obree, who last month captured the world pursuit title from an
absent Boardman in Colombia, suffered bad luck when his self-built bike
came apart at the start. One of the pedals came away as he tried to
launch off, forcing the race to be abandoned. The Scot returned with a
borrowed bike.
The Englishman led by more than three seconds at the halfway mark.
Obree closed, but was 1.7 seconds behind at the end. Boardman clocked
4min 39.821sec, a modest time by his standards.
''I would have preferred to have competed on equal terms,'' he said.
Obree said: ''I think it would all have been different if I'd had my
own bike. I just don't know what happened at the first start. The pedal
just came away. I think it may have been damaged on the plane on the way
over.''

CITY of Glasgow Ragazzi's European dream is not over, in spite of the
Scottish champions having crashed out of the European Cup on Sunday.
New European rules mean that first-round losers in the Champions' Cup
are given access to the Confederation Cup -- volleyball's UEFA Cup.
Ragazzi will host a four-team tournament in December which will
feature Paris UC (France), Osijek (Croatia), and either Balkancar
(Bulgaria) or Stavbar (Slovakia).
At the Kelvin Hall at the weekend, Ragazzi lost in the Champions' Cup
6-0 on aggregate to Norwegians Batsfjord.
Coach Tommy Dowens has promised a ''long, hard look'' at his club
after the disappointing show.
Admittedly, the Norwegians enjoy an annual budget of #180,000 due to
sponsorship from the likes of Shell and can afford to give new Croatian
Milorad Kovac a salary of #30,000.
But Ragazzi should have given them more of a contest, and the 5-15,
3-15, 6-15 defeat in Sunday's second leg was a major blow to Dowens.
Over the two legs, his main players did not come up to scratch and
Ragazzi do not yet have the strength in depth to mount a challenge at
this level.
One of the factors in Sunday's slump was undoubtedly the absence of
setter Kenny Milne who injured his ankle during last Friday's first leg.
But Dowens refused to use that as an excuse.
The Norwegians now face Danish champions Holte IF in the second round
-- Holte having beaten Icelandic champions HK Kopavogur 6-0 on aggregate
and ironically by exactly the same points margin (90-34) that Batsfjord
beat Ragazzi.

LIVE-wire England winger Jason Robinson faces a battle to be fit for
Saturday's World Cup final against holders Australia at Wembley.
The 21-year-old Wigan ace, who has scored three tries in the
competition so far, picked up a foot injury in the first half of
Saturday's 25-10 semi-final defeat of Wales at Old Trafford.
England coach Phil Larder said yesterday: ''He played with a lot of
pain in the second half. There must be a doubt at this moment.''
Robinson, who scored a try in the World Cup opener against the Aussies
at Wembley earlier this month, said of his injury: ''It's very sore. I
twisted it in a tackle and someone fell across me.
''I'll not be running on it for a while, but it's early days yet. I'm
having pain-relieving treatment, but the physio said I have to keep the
muscles mobile. It's strained and bruised.''
Robinson's Wigan team-mate Andy Farrell had to leave midway through
the second half against Wales with a groin injury, but the loose forward
is expected to be fit for the weekend.

A DRIVER who caused the death of a 63-year-old grandfather in a car
crash on the A77 in July, was yesterday jailed for six years and banned
from driving for life at the High Court in Kilmarnock.
Norman Monteith, 28, of Hawthorn Drive, Girvan, admitted causing the
death of Mr Alexander Chisholm by driving without due care and
attention, at excessive speed and while unfit to drive through drink or
drugs.
He also pleaded guilty to charges of driving while disqualified and
without insurance.
Mrs Valerie Stacey, Advocate-depute, told the court that Monteith had
a number of previous convictions, and that at Ayr Sheriff Court last
October he had been fined and disqualified for dangerous driving,
driving while disqualified and while unfit through drink or drugs.
Mrs Stacey said that the collision happened near to the Floak farm
road end while visibility was good.
The accused had been driving north in a Vauxhall Cavalier when he
pulled out to overtake a lorry, swerved and appeared to lose control of
the vehicle. His car crossed the road and collided head on with the Ford
Sierra.
She added: ''Mr Chisholm was accompanied by his son-in-law Mr Andrew
McClurg who was injured and shocked after the crash when it was apparent
that Mr Chisholm had died.

DUTCHMAN Jacco Eltingh earned a crack at world No.1 Andre Agassi after
cruising through his first-round match in the #1.2m Essen Open in
Germany yesterday.
Eltingh, ranked world No.36, beat Bernd Karbacher, of Germany, 6-2,
6-4 to qualify for a second-round clash with Agassi, who had a bye.
The event has attracted the entire world top 10 and 17 of the top 20
as the leading players chase points for qualification for next month's
world championship in Frankfurt.
Only Agassi, fellow Americans Pete Sampras and Michael Chang, and
Austrian Thomas Muster have already qualified, leaving four places open
for the round-robin Frankfurt tournament.
Germany's Boris Becker opens his campaign for points in the second
round against Swede Magnus Gustafsson, who scored a 6-4, 6-2 first-round
win over American Aaron Krickstein yesterday.
* FORMER Wimbledon winner Michael Stich, of Germany, will be sidelined
for at least six weeks with ligament injuries after taking a nasty spill
during a match in Vienna, his doctor said yesterday.
But Dr Werner Zirngibl said the world No.12 will not face an operation
as initially feared. Medical tests done in Munich revealed there were no
fissures or breaks in his left foot.
Stich writhed in pain on Friday after he slipped and fell while
chasing a ball at the net in the first set of his match against
Australia's Todd Woodbridge.

#1.2m Essen Open and the forthcoming world championship in Frankfurt.
The American, who finished last season in second spot, said: ''This
fall is a critical time for me. I hope to finish the year as No.1. A
major factor will be whoever plays well here.''
Agassi, looking lean and fit, is seeded to meet his main rival and
fellow-American Pete Sampras in the final of the tournament which has
attracted the world's top-10 players.
After playing a rare doubles match today, Agassi -- given a
first-round bye -- will begin his campaign tomorrow against Dutchman
Jacco Eltingh, who cruised past German Bernd Karbacher 6-2, 6-4 in
yesterday's first round.
The match will mark the 25-year-old Las Vegas-based player's first
appearance on the ATP tour since he lost to Sampras in the final of the
US Open in September.
Agassi, Sampras, Austrian Thomas Muster, and American Michael Chang
are the only four players to have secured their places for the
round-robin Frankfurt championship, which brings together the top eight
players in the world.
With four more places at stake, many of the top stars have come to
Essen in the hope of picking up the vital points for qualification.
Boris Becker, the world No.4, will start his bid today against Magnus
Gustafsson. The Swede beat American Aaron Krickstein 6-4, 6-2.
* FORMER Wimbledon winner Michael Stich, of Germany, will be sidelined
for at least six weeks with ligament injuries after falling during a
match in Vienna.

A BRITISH woman has been detained in a French prison on a Spanish
extradition warrant issued four years ago, it was revealed yesterday.
The offences alleged against her date back to 1991 when Spanish police
accused her of being involved with smuggling cannabis.
Mrs Brenda Price, 45, from Harlow, Essex, is being held in Loos prison
near Lille. She was arrested 19 days ago while visiting Lille with her
husband.
Mrs Price has already appeared in a British court in 1993 after being
arrested and detained in Holloway Prison on the same extradition
warrant, but she was released when the Spanish authorities were late in
submitting the warrant.
Her French lawyer, Maitre Robert Thompson said yesterday: ''She is
totally bewildered but originally it appears the Spaniards said she had
handed keys to two men connected with a lorry being used for
smuggling.''
Last night Mr Stephen Jakobi of Fair Trials Abroad said: ''The
extradition warrant was executed in this country in January 1993 and
discharged in February 1994. We are concerned about incidents in the EU
where authorities forget to cancel warrants across the community. This
could happen to anybody at any time.''
Mr Price was yesterday trying to obtain passes to visit his wife. The
Foreign Office said officials were arranging to visit Mrs Price in
prison.

REMY Cointreau saw a sharp fall in cognac sales in the six months to
September with a 15% setback to Ffr961m (about #125m). This restrained
the overall group advance in turnover to 3.7% to Ff2940m (#381m).
The shares of the Highland Distilleries associate dropped Ffr8 to
Ffr125. Sentiment on the Paris Bourse affected by Remy's comment that
price increases and unfavourable exchange rates will have a significant
effect on earnings in the short term.
Like almost all major French exporters, Remy is being hard hit by the
artificially high franc and real interest rates.
The company added that as most of its activities are affected by
seasonal fluctuations, it is still too early to estimate precisely
results for the full financial year.
A major unknown may well be reaction to the French nuclear tests,
which could affect trading in the current quarter which is the most
important of the year.
Cognac, which normally achieves trading margins of more than 20%, was
hit by price increases introduced at the beginning of the year.
Cointreau, which has its largest market in Italy, saw volumes drop
because of higher prices.
Wine sales, however, were well ahead. Charles Heidsieck and the
cheaper Piper Heidsieck champagnes saw a 38% rise in turnover to Ff342m
but this is a low margin (perhaps 6%) business.
The partnership brands including Highland's Famous Grouse, which has
about 550,000 annual cases handled by the Remy international
distribution network and also Macallan-Glenlivet's The Macallan whisky,
together achieved a 14% rise in turnover to Ffr675m and may well be more
profitable than champagne.

SCOTTISHPOWER said yesterday it had received acceptances for 93.8% of
Manweb and would legally oblige minority shareholders in the English
regional electricity company (REC) to sell out if they refused to do so
voluntarily.
But ScottishPower shares slumped 15p to 356p as the Glasgow-based
company allocated nearly 25 million of its own shares to underwriters at
343p and they sold on a large quantity to take profits.
Some 8.3 million ScottishPower shares changed hands during the
session.
ScottishPower said that since declaring its offer for Manweb
unconditional on October 9, it had received acceptances for 93.8% of the
company's shares.
A spokesman said the company would write to Manweb's remaining
shareholders ''over the next few days'', urging them to accept its
cash-plus-shares offer -- currently worth 1010p per share -- or the
all-cash alternative of 990p.
But he warned that in due course ScottishPower would use compulsory
acquisition procedures to mop up any shares outstanding.
Manweb shares fell 10p to 1010p yesterday as the slide in
ScottishPower shares reduced the value of the shares-plus-cash offer to
this level.
Institutions underwrote an issue of 118 million ScottishPower shares
to finance the bid for Manweb. They were left holding nearly 25 million
shares after ScottishPower achieved control of 93.8% of the
Chester-based REC by last Friday's deadline.
Nick Pink, an electricity analyst with broker SBC Warburg, said the
underwriters had ended up with more shares than expected so quite a lot
had been sold on.
He said that because ScottishPower had bought a 28% stake in Manweb
for cash on the open market, there had been less demand for
ScottishPower shares in exchange for Manweb shares than originally
anticipated.
ScottishPower played down the sell-off and predicted that its share
price would soon bounce back. Some selling by underwriters was normal at
the end of any successful bid, it said.
ScottishPower now controls more than the 91.5% of Manweb legally
required for it to undertake the compulsory purchase of all outstanding
shares, but no date has been set for mounting such an operation.
The company said said its offer for Manweb shares would remain open
until further notice.

ONCE again there was a rush for the mighty Deutschmark as political
trouble loomed in Europe, with the focus on Italy and France.
Sterling was dragged down 1.7 pfennigs to DM2.1877 despite reasonable
GDP figures which suggested to analysts the economy was slowing
satisfactorily.
The dollar was affected somewhat by wrangles over the US Budget and
the pound gained more than a third of a cent to $1.5805.
The lira was hit by an upcoming confidence vote in the Dini Government
which is expected to be close and could trigger a general election.
The franc was upset by reports that a French lawyer had asked the
state prosecutor to investigate a flat rented by President Jacques
Chirac. A similar case against premier Alain Juppe was dropped recently.
There was also some nervousness ahead of a meeting tomorrow between
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Chirac and dealers will be watching for
any diminution of German support for the currency.
The mark also benefited from a feeling that interest rates were not
going any lower following growth in German M3 money supply last week.

LEICESTER has always been a profitable venue for Henry Cecil, who can
complete a double with Moneefa and Lady Carla.
Moneefa, lightly raced in 1995, can make the most of a lenient-looking
mark in the one-mile Ermine Street Handicap.
This Darshaan filly, the winner of a Beverley Handicap in July, has
run with plenty of credit on her two subsequent starts, despite managing
no better than a seventh placing.
Half-an-hour earlier, Cecil's newcomer Lady Carla can win the EBF Hoby
Maiden Stakes. A daughter of Caerleon, Lady Carla cost 200,000 guineas
as a yearling and is well related on her dam's side. Cecil has an
enviable strike-rate at Leicester with his juveniles.
The 10-furlongs Castle Handicap looks difficult but those seeking an
involvement could do much worse than David Morley's consistent
six-year-old Hawkish.
* JEREMY Glover made it first time lucky abroad with South Rock,
ridden by Paul Eddery, who ran out a game 34-10 winner of the Listed
Prix de Saint-Cyr (7f) for three-year-old fillies at Evry yesterday.
The British filly made a fast start and, after going clear on hitting
the straight, stuck to her guns to repel Karliyka by a head, with Tousle
a further four lengths back.
Glover's dual Cambridgeshire winner Rambo's Hall was backed from 25-1
to 16-1 with William Hill yesterday for the Tote Credit November
Handicap at Doncaster.
A trainer who often does well in the autumn, Glover saddled a double
at Doncaster on Saturday with juvenile Carburton (5-4) and handicapper
Croft Pool (7-2).

SHOULD Sam Torrance not have been exempt from penalty when he dropped
a marker, causing his ball to move, on the third green of the Old Course
in his match last Friday against Heinz Peter Thuel? Rule 20-1 says there
is no penalty if a ball is moved in the process of lifting it under a
rule. Was Torrance not actually in this process?
NO. Decision 20-1/15 deals with this instance and says that the
process of lifting a ball refers only to the specific act of placing a
marker behind it to mark its position. Dropping a marker on the ball is
outside the terms of that act and comes under the category of the player
causing the ball to move. The penalty is one shot under Rule 18-2a and
the ball must be replaced.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke last night poured cold water on European
Commission forecasts of 11 million new EU jobs in the next five years.
He warned that predictions in a report on the table at talks in
Luxembourg were over-optimistic.
''We must not set ourselves targets which are not within our power to
deliver,'' Mr Clarke told fellow finance ministers.
However, he agreed that if the member states committed themselves to
low inflation and sound public finances, the goal of getting more
Europeans back to work might be attainable.
The Chancellor insisted that if millions of new jobs were created,
many would come to Britain as the ''enterprise centre of Europe''.
The ministers were considering an upbeat assessment from the
Commission that Europe's jobless rate could fall from the current 10.6%
to 7.5% by the end of the decade.
That was only a possibility, insisted Mr Clarke, if sound economic
policies were matched by the provision of more funds for job training,
reducing non-wage costs on employers -- and keeping out of the Social
Chapter, which was a recipe for extra costs on businesses and
consequently more lost jobs.
The Commission report maintains the 11 million jobs can be created by
the year 2000 if national treasuries can manage average economic growth
between 3 and 3.5% in that period.
The targeted 7.5% jobless rate could fall a further 2.5%, says the
Commission, if the economic upturn is matched by practical measures to
help employers and support traditionally hard-pressed regions.

THE latest move to combat slow play via the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club's rehashing of Rule 6-7 may have met so far with universal
acceptance, but how is it going to work?
This rule always did have the scope to penalise slow play through the
words: ''The player shall play without undue delay.'' The penalty was
two strokes, but decisions on this rule refer only to instances where a
player, after starting a round, returns to the clubhouse for a forgotten
club or searches for a ball for 10 minutes, twice the time allowed.
These are different from the more common occurrence of players waiting
for an eternity while the seemingly motionless group in front occupy the
green and then dawdle to the next tee where they invariably still are by
the time you have putted out.
However, from January 1 Rule 6-7 will include the words ''slow play''
for the first time, and last week's news release from the R and A said:
''The committee has been granted additional powers whereby it may, in
the conditions of a competition, lay down pace-of-play guidelines and in
such a condition modify the penalty for a first offence, in strokeplay,
to one stroke.''
The penalty might have been reduced on paper -- for a first offence --
from two strokes to one, but John Glover, the R an A's rules secretary,
said: ''We have found that committees have been reluctant to apply a
penalty of two strokes. They might apply a one-stroke penalty more
readily, and in that case the penalty is an increase because there is
one where there wasn't before.''
Inevitably, the difficulty is going to be in defining what slow play
actually is.
If you take, say, 80 seconds from the instant it becomes your turn to
putt to the moment the stroke is made -- examining the line from all
angles like Bernhard Langer -- is that a penalty?
Would it be a breach to visit the bushes for a leak when it is your
turn to play? How about leaving your bag on the wrong side of the green
-- a practice guaranteed to irritate -- or changing your mind a few
times about club selection?
Unlikely, perhaps, but on the matter of definition, the R and A are
firmly passing the buck. ''Our intention is to put the authority with
local clubs who know what is an acceptable pace of play,'' said Glover.
For example, he added, in Greenland, where players will have to get a
move on to keep warm, two hours for a round might be an acceptable time
whereas in Bangkok, where the heat is oppressive, five hours might be
reasonable.
A penalty could be applied, he said, in a Saturday medal. If the
guideline is at three hours for a round and a group are out of place in
finishing -- say two holes behind the last lot off the course -- one or
all of the players could be penalised. The problem then will be
establishing who is the slow player.
''We don't want to penalise anyone, we want players to speed up,'' he
said, ''and the intention is for the committee to be more specific.''
The R and A set pace-of-play guidelines for the Open Championship.
Under normal conditions these are no more than 4hr 15min per round for
the first two days when matches are in threes, and 3hr 50min for the
final two days when matches are in twos. Depending on length of
individuals holes, each should be completed in between 13 and 16 minutes
for the first two rounds and 11 to 14 minutes for the last two.
If a match falls behind with no mitigating circumstances the referee
will politely ask them to step on the gas and only if that fails will
more severe measures be taken, first by timing the culprits and
ultimately penalising them, a step that has never been taken.
Such guidelines, though, would hardly be operable for clubs where play
is comparatively unobserved, though we have heard of a medal at a
Renfrewshire club where an official stood at the back of the second
green with a clipboard apparently jotting down notes. Players, as a
result, broke all pace-of-play records whereupon our man, with a
flourish, revealed on the back of his clipboard a completed crossword
puzzle.
Observers, then, are one solution -- in the unlikely event of
volunteers. Another more practical idea may be to clock in and out, or
at least have a space on the scorecard for time of starting, time of
finishing, and if late, the reason why.
Bureaucracy like this may be undesirable, but worse still is having to
wait to play every shot because of slowcoaches in front, while you are
also being squeezed by equally impatient players from behind.
If these details have to filled in along with scores -- combined with
a notice on the first tee saying ''For the purpose of Rule 6-7 today's
time for a round is 3hr 15min'' -- it might be enough threat in itself
to produce the desired result.
Traditionalnotices such as ''your place on the course is behind the
group in front not in front of the group behind'' are obviously too
subtle.
Committees have all winter to formulate their rules. Details of any
examples and their applications will be welcome in this column.

Mr Gourlay, 40, was previously projects director on the board of Bass,
the brewing group. He was born in Glasgow and holds a postgraduate
degree in brewing from from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
Allied Distillers, which produces the popular Ballantine's and
Teacher's blends and the Laphroaig Islay malt, established a logistics
department in March. It now employs 75 people.
The company, which is part of the Allied Domecq group, hopes the new
focus on logistics will improve its forecasting and customer relations
and bring about greater efficiency in the management of materials from
whisky through to cardboard packaging.
Allied, which is part of the Allied Domecq group, employs nearly 2000

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday accused his Labour
counterpart of ''smears'' against the chairman of the new water watchdog
body.
Last week, Labour asked questions in the House of Commons about
whether Mr Dick Douglas, chairman of the Water and Sewerage Customers'
Council, which will represent consumers' interests when Scotland's three
new water authorities take over next year, had paid his community charge
since being appointed and, if he had not, why the Government had
appointed him.
However, Mr Douglas, a former Labour MP who switched to the Scottish
National Party before being defeated at the 1992 General Election,
stated that he had paid his poll tax in full as far back as 1991.
Yesterday, Mr Forsyth released the text of a reply he has sent to a
letter from Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
Mr Forsyth fully backed the water watchdog chairman and said Mr
Robertson should apologise for ''smears'' against Mr Douglas.
The letter said in part: ''Dick Douglas has made his own position on
the community charge clear, as it was right he should. Smears about his
record, for that is what they are, are an unworthy diversionary tactic
-- but perhaps not surprising, given the increase in domestic water
charges of 76% in the last six years over which local government has
presided.''
Last night, Mr Robertson described Mr Forsyth's letter as
''astonishing''. He said: ''Clearly he is trying to pin the blame for
increases in water charges on local authorities when it is he who is
proposing a special tap tax for the people of Scotland.''
The ''tap tax'' is Labour's name for what it claims will be an extra
#230 on average family water bills each year in Scotland, because of
Government plans to bring in private operators.
Mr Robertson added that it was ironic that Mr Douglas, ''now one of
Michael Forsyth's key placemen'', should have apparently paid his poll
tax when the SNP had encouraged so many Scots not to pay theirs.
Mr Douglas last night dismissed Labour's attacks on him as ''schoolboy
stuff''. He said: ''The people who raised this matter last week, using
the House of Commons, knew in March 1991 that I had paid the poll tax.
''If George Robertson wants to challenge me on my record or my
behaviour, let him tell me the next time he raises it so that I can have
the opportunity to reply.''

THE Potato Marketing Board, due to disappear within two years, has
drawn up a research and development programme which could help British
growers and processors retain a grasp on their existing share of
increasingly competitive international market, writes ROY GREGOR.
It will involve space age technology in identifying crop areas through
satellite images and the use of electronic ''noses'' that will pinpoint
disease threats in storage warehouses. However, at the top of the list
will still be the consumer-led demands for potatoes that are nutritious
and bruise and blemish free.
Nutritional quality is also high on the R&amp;D agenda and its is expected
there will be a consumer demand for low-fat chips; not just the
mass-market oven-bake types but ones that will be available in the fish
and chip shops and, eventually in the home. This is required to combat
the sales of alternatives such as pasta and rice.
In overall terms, potato consumption has risen over the last 20 years
to the present 110kg per person per years. It is the form in which that
amount is consumed that puts Britain in a difficult position when
competing with the largest-scale processors in Europe.
In Scotland the potato crop is worth #115m and yesterday in Edinburgh,
Dr Barbara Johnson, head of the board's research and development
division, announced one of the most wide-ranging assessments of the
industry and its ongoing research. It calls for increasing consumer
appeal, import substitutions, more exports of ware and seed together
with reduced damage and better dissemination of research findings.
She said: ''This is a long-term businesss which requires continuity of
planning and finance. We have set out a rational basis for the
establishment of priorities designed to help sustain a competitive
British potato industry.''

HAVE you noticed how increasingly the bathroom is being used as a
public library? Oh, the big-value roll-on deodorant is still on the
shelf but, wedged between it and the bluebell bath essence, there is now
an armful of bathside literature. Chosen mostly to impress, it ranges
from Mrs Gaskell to Proust, with the best of the Bookers thrown in.
And that is the problem. Most bathside literature just isn't
waterproof. So the bathside book, which has led to the bathside
bookcase, has in turn caused the sud-soaked bathside chair to be
replaced by the safely distanced bathside sofa. Indeed, such are the
bathroom's distractions now, you can spend all day in there and never
miss the outside world.
In a second-hand bookshop, the other day, we encountered the ultimate
bathside title: The Shower Songbook, a wipe-clean, plastic anthology of
medleys first produced in America, the land of hot-tub culture. The
publishers are listed as Steam Press of Massachusetts but, that said,
the book's collection seems to owe more to the Scottish pub than the
Yankee bath-house.
Will Fyffe's I Belong To Glasgow is there but, inexplicably, not I'm
Forever Blowing Bubbles. O Sole Mio is in and also the Toreador Song
from Carmen, but beyond those, for all closet Pavarottis and Domingos
who, in the bathroom, feel secure enough to call a tune an aria, there
is nothing but disappointment. No Rigoletto, no Traviata, no Tosca or
Butterfly, and definitely no snippet from The Ring.
All right, so maybe expecting Wagner is pushing the larynx a little.
On the other hand much of the vocal acrobatics emanating from bathrooms
resembles Wagner, anyway. Who among us does not have a relative whose
Siegfried variations, accompanied by crashing soap dishes and passing
thuds on the door, sound no worse than an off-day at Bayreuth?
On reflection, this isn't the ultimate bathside book at all but merely
an attempt at such distinction. At the very least the ultimate
gurgle-and-gargle repertoire would include For Those In Peril on the
Sea, My Way, Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud, and most certainly Stop Your
Tickling Jock.
But it is a funny thing about bathrooms. Inside them, more than any
other room including the bedroom, people annoint their fantasies with
the perfumes and balm of self-belief. Of course, in the outside world,
the executive bathroom has become one of the most desirable power
symbols of corporate life. Everyone knows this is where the true deals
are struck, where secrets are exchanged to the symphonic refrains of
upmarket plumbing, and where loyalty is pledged with a few Masonic tugs
of the towel dispenser.
When the Irangate scandal was at its height, the story that most
intrigued Washington was the one about Oliver North and John Poindexter
plotting their shifty doings not on some long-range golf course but in
one of the top-brass lavatories on Capitol Hill. But back in the
residential bathroom, man is both the philosopher and conquerer of his
world.
Naked but for a sceptred loofah and orb of carbolic, he sinks ever
deeper into the lather of heroic ambition, just as Archimedes did so
many thousands of years before. He's the chap who stepped into the
foaming bath that overflowed, thus allowing him to discover the secrets
of buoyancy; a body emersed in fluid loses as much in weight as the
weight of the fluid it displaces.
Today, even the general accoutrements of the bathroom urge a pursuit
of knowledge with toothpaste, gels, corn plasters, and shampoos now
often coming in multi-lingual packs. With certain anti-dandruff lotions
you can clear up scalp problems in six languages, using the bathroom's
uncommonly good acoustics to practice pronunciation at the same time.
The unexpected bonus, here, is that what sounds like an unseemly
irritation in one tongue turns into poetry or high drama in another.
In French dandruff, les pelicules, has the pretty rhythm of an
endearment . . . ''Ah, ma petite pelicule . . .'', while eliminating the
stuff in German, with gegen Schuppen, suggests the kind of operatic
intensity good old Brunhilde could soar on about for hours.
But something, other than intelligence, is also overtaking the
bathroom just now. Slowly, ostentatiously, what was once the smallest
room in the house is reverting to its pre-Christian role of commune
where whole families go to play and relax in sunken pools and potted
palms and orchids. It's a damnable trait, for when the bathroom ceases
to be a solitary cell, the quality of privacy vanishes, and only the
grave is left as the place to be unassailably alone.

COMPETITORS have rapidly taken market share away from British Gas in
the commercial and industrial markets but they will find the domestic
market a tougher nut to crack.
The changes forced on the group have been traumatic but it still has
over two years to prepare for a fully-competitive domestic gas market
and the start date could well slip, particularly if Labour forms the
next Government.
Still, Seeboard and Amoco clearly mean business with their joint
venture which has the ambitious goal of competing nationwide with
British Gas on the basis of prices 10% below the latter's and on
superior service.
British Gas is hamstrung on prices at the moment because of its ''take
or pay'' contracts which force it to pay agreed prices to gas producers
whether it requires the gas or not.
Since the contracts were struck gas prices have about halved, leaving
the group with heavy losses. However, it hopes to re-negotiate the
contracts and it should have greater flexibility on pricing in a couple
of years time.
So long as safety and continuity of supply are fully maintained,
competition will benefit the consumer and there will be major advantages
in an electricity company also supplying gas, with much scope for
manpower economies. Meter reading and servicing functions can be
combined and there are marketing advantages in one company supplying
both energy sources.
British Gas will not take loss of market share lying down and will
have the great advantage of consumer inertia. The decline in its share
is likely to be gradual compared to the industrial and commercial
situation.
A bid for Seeboard would upset the apple cart but not necessarily end
the joint venture with Amoco as a buyer could well want to keep the
business idea going, given the sense it makes.
Indeed, a significant gas producer could be tempted to go the whole
hog and enter the bidding ring for an electricity company, though this
would be a riskier approach than going the joint venture route.
Much relief
A DEEP sigh of relief echoed round the City yesterday after Glaxo
Wellcome said it had come to an accommodation with Genpharm over patent
litigation.
Glaxo reached the agreement instead of relying on the US courts to
rule on its patent rights to ranitidine hydrochloride, a the key
ingredient in its all-important Zantac anti-ulcerant.
The City was happy that the case did not go to court because the
findings of juries, particularly in the US, can defy logic. Also a
head-on contest between two of the world's largest pharmaceutical groups
-- Genpharm is a subsidiary of Merck -- promised to be very expensive.
For an undisclosed payment, Genpharm will not launch any generic
competition to Zantac in the US until July 1997 for the basic Form One
patent or until 2002 for the Form Two -- the crystalline structures are
a mirror image of each other.
Form Two is the one sold as Zantac and Glaxo argued that for others to
produce Form One would infringe the Zantac patent.
In the market, shares rose 52[1/2]p to 849p.
Price cuts of up to 30% have already been introduced for the drug in
Germany where the patent has already expired.
That will be the pattern elsewhere as the intellectual rights expire
on the drug. Some of Zantac's competitor products such as SmithKline
Beecham's Tagamet and Astra's Losec have perhaps as good clinical
properties.
The City has forecast a decline in Zantac sales of perhaps #2200m for
1995 to perhaps #900m by the year 2000 although even that may be
optimistic because healthcare spending is becoming stringent.
But Zantac has served its purpose in providing both the cash flow to
fund the huge Glaxo research effort and also to support its Wellcome
purchase. The fruits of the takeover include the expected #800m annual
savings as well as the acquisition of the dominant world player in
anti-virals and a major participant in anti-cancers.
The Genpharm agreement points to Zantac cash flow being maintained at
a higher level than was feared -- and Glaxo does need cash with its
current net debt of more than #3000m putting it at something of a
disadvantage as the global pharmaceutical industry strikes new
alliances.
Perfect timing
PETER Wood's timing, as ever, was impeccable.
About a decade ago, he got in ahead of the game with the direct
selling of motor insurance by telephone, cutting out brokers and their
commissions and underpricing rivals.
During the weekend, he once again struck while the iron was hot.
After two weeks of intense takeover speculation surrounding Royal Bank
-- characteristically punctuated by bland comments from the perceived
bid prey and no comment from those considered to be potential bidders --
Wood spoke his mind.
If anyone considering a hostile bid was unaware of his clout, they
certainly won't be now.
Whether he was firing a warning shot on his own behalf, or in
conjunction with Royal Bank, is unclear.
However, the bank, which believes ''the interests of shareholders,
customers and staff are best served by us remaining an independent
financial services group headquartered in Edinburgh'', is probably not
too unhappy with the publicity.
A successful hostile bid for the likes of Royal Bank would be
unprecedented. It would not be cheap and the threat of Wood wrecking
Direct Line, the jewel in the bank's crown, is certain to weigh heavily
on any predator's mind.
Wood's warning is ominous: ''Taking apart your own creation would not
be easy. I hope never to have to do that.''
It must be assumed Wood is referring to the emotional trauma of
destroying something he has built up.
But perhaps it ''would not be easy'' for him to do this in practical
terms.
Direct Line is ten years old and, although still relatively new to the
mortgage market, it is an old hand at insurance.
There is no denying Wood's magic in establishing the UK's largest
motor insurer and the #50m-plus he has made in the process is ample
evidence of his success.
However, whether he would be able to take Direct Line apart by going
off and establishing a rival venture remains to be seen.
It will certainly be an interesting battle if a predator wins Royal
Bank and calls his bluff.

THE word entrepreneur has entered everyday business language but how
many of us have considered what it really means?
It is derived from the French entreprendre meaning ''to undertake''
but this really give us little help in understanding the modern meaning.
To me entrepreneurs are the ''doers'' -- those men and women who have
the courage to go it alone, to overcome all obstacles in their way and
who have the nerve to risk failure as well as success.
How do we convince more of our fellow Scots to become risk takers? As
with so many aspects of life, good role models are important. This
week's book looks at a cross-section of Scottish business people who are
all doers and have demonstrated the true meaning of the word
entrepreneur.
This week's reviewer is Sir Gavin Laird (left). A former trade
unionist, Sir Gavin himself displays many of the attributes of an
entrepreneur. Among his other interests, he is a director of Scottish
Television, Britannia Life, GEC Scotland, and Edinburgh Investment
Trust.
HOW often have we heard the refrain that Scotland lacks men and women
with entrepreneurial skills?
Terry Houston's book Great Scots in Business* has no pretensions to
destroy the myth. Rather, it modestly sets out (and succeeds) in adding
a useful volume to Scottish business literature.
That said, the recounting of the story of Scots who ''made it'' helps
demonstrate just how facile is the assertion that somehow the Scots
compared to the English lack entrepreneurial skills.
The stories -- all 10 of them -- are at their best in describing the
nature of individuals, the mistakes they have made in pursuit of success
and sometimes the price they pay in terms of personal life.
Where the book is at its best is in telling us what entrepreneurs
(what an awful word) have in common -- native intelligence, a strong
streak of independence, ambition, self-discipline and the motivation to
work extremely hard.
All the stories of these Scots are well worth reading. Four in
particular stand out. Chapter one takes us into the unusual world of
David Murray -- best known as chairman of Rangers Football Club.
His Murray International Group employs in excess of 3000 people
spanning a range of countries from Scotland to New Zealand via the UAR
and Singapore. With an annual turnover heading for #200m he has run a
company that has been profitable in 19 of its 20 years of existence.
At an early age his parents split up, his education was curtailed and
his father was declared bankrupt. Then, in his early twenties, a
horrific car accident cost him both his legs. How many people could
survive all that, let alone prosper? Murray did, and that is the quality
of the man.
Pat and Alex Grant of Norfrost exemplify all that is best in small
business. ''Anything we can get in the Highlands, we will get in the
Highlands, provided price matches quality, and we can have delivery when
we need it (just in time).
''Our main aim is to create as many jobs as we can in Caithness and
look after our local economy. That's what we want to do more than
anything else.''
Who said capitalists had no soul!
This is a story of hard work, enterprise and of grudging and all too
little initial help from the Highland Board -- I was a member at the
time! Perhaps above all, the story of a very determined lady who proved
that glass ceilings for women are there to be smashed.
Twenty-nine years of age, a millionaire and retired to California, the
Tom Farmer story could have ended there. Thankfully for Scotland
''retirement'' lasted all of six months before he came back home to
found Kwik-Fit.
The success ingredients are there aplenty -- hard work, willingness to
take a risk, customer consciousness and always a quality product. From
literally nothing to a multi-national concern with hundreds of outlets
and a turnover in the multi-millions.
What is different in the Tom Farmer story is not just that he has been
successful twice but in his unique way of creating real teamwork whereby
ownership is real for all employees. Similarly his commitment to
training spend is substantial, an example others would do well to
follow. A great Scot indeed.
David Murray, Pat and Alex Grant, and Tom Farmer are all famous names
but the book is no less interesting when it focuses on lesser-known
business names. The chapters on Neil Baird Watson, Elie Chilton and on
three young enterprising Scots are no less fascinating.
Let me end, however, by referring you to the chapter on Scotland's
biggest car retailer -- Arnold Clark. His initiatives, particularly in
times of economic depression (and we've had our share of them) make
intriguing reading.
His personal philosophy of avoiding debt carried over to his business
affairs. When it was all too popular to borrow for growth, and later pay
the penalty, this philosophy paid dividends in every sense of the word.
There are other lessons for the budding business person in the Arnold
Clark story. How many multi-million pound businesses have a chief
executive who has worked without space of his own in the head office?
How many chief executives at 66 years of age work six days a week, 12
hours a day?
How many ensure they visit each of their 37 outlets at least once a
fortnight and how many businesses have increased apprenticeship training
-- I can tell you very few.
So there you have it -- a story of Scots who made it. A few very well
known, some not so, and others unknown. We are all the beneficiaries of
their success. I wish we had many more like them.

WHEN Judas Iscariot betrayed our Lord Jesus Christ, he did so with a
kiss. Your world news report (Dutch admit role in Holocaust murders,
October 21) shows that false charity can still be used as a cloak for
malice.
By accusing the Roman Catholic Church of having ''a tradition of
theological and church anti-Semitism'' the Roman Catholic Bishops'
conference in the Netherlands distorted God's truth in the interests of
(atheistic) ecumenism.
There is a great difference between expounding a spiritual truth,
which the Church is bound to do, and exciting racial hatred which it has
never done.
These bishops know very well that the Roman Catholic Church neither
encouraged nor condoned the evil genocide perpetrated by the Nazis
against the Jewish race.
Pope Pius XII, who was under constant threat from Nazi aggression,
saved thousands of Jewish lives through the Vatican underground.
He ordered that hundreds of thousands of Christian baptismal
certificates be distributed to the Jews to help them escape from
German-occupied countries. His concern for the Jewish people so touched
Chief Rabbi Zolla of Rome that he was converted to the Catholic faith.
Then there is the example of St Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish Franciscan
friar who was imprisoned in the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz. He was not
a Jew but a Catholic clergyman imprisoned, like many others, for being a
Catholic clergyman. He took the place of a man condemned to death
because he had a family. He was not concerned with whether or not the
poor man was a Jew.
From this it is quite clear that these post-Vatican II revolutionaries
in the Netherlands have neither love for nor loyalty to the truth.
There are different degrees of evil acts for which God demands justice
and repentance. From the German race came an evil genocide, the cruel
death of millions of innocent Jewish men, woman, and children.
From the Jewish race came deicide, the murder of the only begotten son
of God. The Catholic Chruch calls the perpetrators and supporters of
both crimes to repentance. For, like her master, she wishes not the
death (spiritual of otherwise) of the sinner.

RUTH Wishart's article (Arrogant, armed, and dangerous, October 16) is
long on anti-Tory vitriol and short on any suggestions on penal reform.
She is critical of Home Secretary Howard's proposal that a six-month
sentence should mean what it says. She even quotes the high, the mighty,
and even civil servant experts to support her.
Does she ignore that the present system (of which she is so critical)
is the handiwork of yesterday's experts? Mr Howard is merely suggesting
that, if you are a criminal, you pay the full price -- and no discount
for behaviour that the rest of us regard as normal.
Indeed, if they do misbehave inside, why not an increase to the
sentence?
Her concern with the well-being of the criminal and his right to early
release seems to be typical of those who are not on the receiving end of
criminal behaviour.
There are no experts on the penal system. True, there are lots of
people with lots of theories -- but there is no comeback if you are
proved totally wrong.
However, while the theories are being tested, most people at the sharp
end will feel a wee bit comforted if the thieving tradesman of whom Ruth
Wishart writes completes the whole of his sentence.

OUR man Brian MacKinnon, aka Brandon Lee the Bearsden mature
schoolboy, has emerged as the subject of some academic analysis in the
magazine New Law Journal. An article by Bridget Dolan, a forensic
psychologist at St George's Hospital, London, tells us that Brandon is a
classic case of pseudologia fantastica, or mythomania.
The characteristics, we are told, of those ''pseudologues'' is that
they create a whole new identity.
Brandon follows on from a long line of examples of pseudologues who
pretended to be kings of Spain, Romanian princesses, or IRA gun-runners.
Closer to Brandon's case is the chap who claimed to be a doctor and
''gave such a convincing account of knowledge and skills that
experienced clinicians found it difficult to fault him''. It was only
when he went on to claim that he was also a dentist, a barrister, and an
accountant that the alarm bells started to ring.
In the final analysis, says Dr Dolan, Brandon is a pretty
straightforward case. ''He was attempting to qualify properly as a
doctor -- not impersonate one. His deception lay in passing himself off
as a 17-year-old, perhaps just an extreme form of normal behaviour such
as tinting out grey hair and forgetting a couple of birthdays.
''Perhaps the current fascination with his case is that MacKinnon was
more successful than most at disguising his age and we all wish we could
learn something of his tricks.''
There is also the outside possibility that the fascination of the
tabloid prints with the story had something to do with finding out if
Brandon, 32, had ever got off with any of the nymphets in his class.
Ideal candidate
AN apocryphal tale, we are sure, about a conversation in the highest
echelons of the Labour Party after Tom Clarke, MP for Monklands West,
won a Shadow Cabinet place in the recent election. What position to
grant Mr Clarke, appropriate to his high standing on the voting list
that would also fit in with his experience. Simple, said one spin
doctor, let's put him in charge of cleaning up local government.
Funeral expenses
BRING out your dead, is the invitation to diners next month at the
Stravaigin restaurant in the West End of Glasgow. Chef at this
establishment is Colin Clydesdale, scion of the Ubiquitous Chip dynasty.
He is a young man who likes to travel the world, often in person but
sometimes by book, and bring back exotic dishes such as Vietnam chicken
and your Guatemala prawn cocktail. Mexico, with its festival of the Dia
de los Muertos is the inspiration for his next beano which takes place
on the same day, November 2, as that country devotes itself to a fiesta
of food, drink, dancing, and music devoted to the memory of their dear
departed.
On the Day of the Dead, Mexicans hie themselves to the local graveyard
with a cairry-oot and a picnic and have a wee party round the family
lair. They also have dinners at home where places are set for those who
are no longer of this world.
Children are given chocolate skulls and sweeties in the form of
skeletons and other deathly images.
Colin of the Stravaigin has wisely opted not to have the dinner in an
adjacent graveyard but in his restaurant. The authentic five-course
Mexican menu includes a couple of mole sauces, which have to do with
spices and not with furry subterranean creatures. There is also
something called Deadman's Bread.
The bad news is that those of you who wish to book places at your
table at Stravaigin on the night for departed relatives will have to pay
the full price of #15.95 a skull. The good news is that, since they
won't eat their tea, you are assured of a copious doggy bag.
In with a chance
HM Porterfield prison in Inverness is not alone in using the franking
machine for its letters as a vehicle for a spot of advertising. A reader
was tickled, however, by the message on the missive he received from
this establishment. It was the well-known slogan promoting a familiar
chocolate snack which would certainly be endorsed by the inmates: ''Have
a break . . . Have a Kit-Kat.''
Arm and a leg
TO our collection of examples of how a suitably imaginative legal
audio-typist can get it wronger that any word-processing machine we add
the following anecdote from the office of the dear departed and sorely
missed Willie McRae.
Willie was toiling away in the offices of Levy McRae on behalf of a
client who felt that he was being exploited by a landlord who was
demanding an exorbitant rent for a flat of outstanding shabbiness and
dereliction.
His forceful arguments were to no avail as he received a stiff letter
from the landlord's solicitors demanding the same high rent, a sum to be
paid, according to the letter, per anum. Being a Latin scholar of some
distinction, Willie had the pleasure of writing back to state that his
client was already paying through the nose and he did not see why he
should also contribute through another part of his anatomy.
Life before death
THOSE of you searching for a Christmas present with a difference might
be tempted by a new line offered by Heaven on Earth, ''the first
design-it-yourself life and death shop'' based in Bristol. It is an
''embodiment chest'' a coffin which, until it is needed, can be adapted
for use as a piece of furniture.
''It can be used as a bookcase, window seat or conventional storage
chest until it's needed to store you!'' as they delicately put it. Or:
''Come oan, get aff that windae seat. We need it tae bury yer granny,''
as they might say in Milngavie.

'Our visitors are the best marketing tool we have -- if we send them
away happy,' says the tourism training boss. So how do you achieve that?
Ian Black offers a progress report.
TOURISM is that unusual thing, an indigenous Scottish industry which
is largely independent of decisions taken in the South and one which
each and every one of us can affect.
It brings in #2billion per year, which is just over 5% of our Gross
National Product and employs 170,000 people, around 8% of the workforce.
It is, however, one industry which has traditionally depended on
something of which Scots are rightly proud -- friendliness and the
quality of welcome given to visitors.
There is an argument that the Scottish Tourist Board should be renamed
the Scottish Visitors Board. Think of the difference in semantic
weighting between the words ''tourist'' and ''visitor''. A visitor is
always welcome, a tourist is to be tolerated, trifled with and often
traduced.
The Irish equivalent is Bord Failte which means Board of Welcome. In
1980, when Basil Fawlty was first appalling us, Bord Failte held a
competition for a name for their new offices. More than 90% of the
suggestions were for Failte Towers.
We have all heard, and indeed often experienced, horror stories of the
indifference and often-outright hostility of our own countrymen and
women to the tourist -- tales of the ''these cigarettes are only for my
regulars'', ''you can't possibly bring children in here'' and ''lunch
finishes at 1.29 and four seconds'' variety.
Ninety-six per cent of people in Britain, if they do not receive the
kind of service they feel they deserve, will nevertheless not complain,
at least not to the people who are (not) delivering the service. They
will, however, tell eight to ten other people of their negative
experience.
I am indebted for the above statistics to Peter Lederer, managing
director of the Gleneagles Hotel and chairman of Tourism Training
Scotland -- a man who has devoted his career to the improvement of the
quality of service in our thrawn wee country.
''Training is marketing,'' he says. ''Our visitors are the best
marketing tool we have if we send them away happy. But every pound we
spend on marketing is wasted if the vistors who come here do not have a
first-class experience.''
Tourism Training Scotland currently spends about #1m per year trying
to sell the idea that training the people who work for our visitor
industry in people and service skills is a good one. In its first three
years it has enhanced the skills of around 10,000 people in its Welcome
Host programme; but this is a very low percentage of the people involved
in the industry, which is fragmented, with a very high proportion of
small, family-run businesses.
It is also characterised by a shortage of skills among management and
staff and has the highest employee turnover of any of Scotland's
industries. This is because the industry as a whole has a very poor
image as an employer compounded by seasonality and high levels of
ill-trained (if trained at all) part-time workers.
Eddie Brogan, head of tourism at Scottish Enterprise, speaking at the
launch of a new programme called Tourism Business Success, had this to
say: ''Visitors are more widely travelled than ever before, with higher
expectations and an increasing choice of holiday destinations. This
represents a serious challenge to the skills of owners and managers,
especially in the areas of sales, marketing and service quality.
''Tourism Business Success has been developed to meet this challenge
and is probably the single most important initiative from TTS to date.''
The 1995 annual report from TTS takes as its theme ''Improving
standards increases profits'', highlighting that more and more companies
recognise the business benefits from effective training and staff
development.
It is trying to encourage a Scotland-wide training culture, not just
of the ''have a nice day, ye ken'' superficial gloss, but the idea that
training can and will help create the feel-good factor that makes people
come back and which promotes all those pleased letters to The Herald.
Towards this end they have distributed 8000 copies so far of an
excellent, easy-to-read-and-follow booklet, titled Staff Recruitment and
Development which, if used properly, might help redress the staff
turnover problem and improve the image.
Image is important. A barman in Dublin is a well-respected man,
likewise a waiter in France. They are both professionals. Here,
traditionally, they are the ones who couldn't get into college -- at
least that is the image.
TTS is trying to change that too and at the second annual Scottish
Hospitality Careers Fair it had an attendance of 4000 (20% up on last
year) and took 1000 job applications during the week.
It would like to do a lot more but needs the cooperation of the
industry. The courses are cheap -- the Welcome Host, for instance, costs
just #45 -- and books and leaflets for self-training are free.
Your local tourist office will tell you where to find them and no
doubt also offer you a hundred thousand welcomes.

She sees the uglier side of life, but she is not looking back. Eric
Kennedy puts the spotlight on a young woman with arresting career
prospects.
IF there were a law against enjoying your job, Jeanette Dillon would
have to arrest herself. As a constable with Strathclyde Police she
reckons she has a job with everything -- variety, fulfilment and
opportunity.
It's five-and-a-half years since she entered the force as a
probationer, embarking on a two-year period during which on-job
experience was combined with two eight-week training courses at the
Scottish Police College in Tulliallan and several at the Force Training
Centre in Glasgow's Oxford Street.
She doesn't regret a moment of it although, when you're dealing with
serious assault, road accidents, and disturbances, you see the uglier
side of life. ''But I approach each case as if it were my first,'' she
says. ''The public expect the best of service from their police force
and I like to treat people the way I would wish to be treated myself.''
The adrenalin flows when she is in a ''situation'' -- whether she is
involved in a police-car pursuit or helping quell a disturbance. During
one incident she disarmed a man who had stabbed her colleague, winning
high praise from the sheriff during the subsequent court case.
Later, she won the Probationer of the Year award, an honour which was
quite unconnected with that incident, so life has not been without
incident.
Jeanette entered the force in April, 1990, following a spell with the
region's social work department in Ayr after leaving Kilmarnock's James
Hamilton Academy with three O-Grades. ''I wanted something with
variety,'' she says.
She was also entering a career with an excellent training and
promotion structure: Women are paid the same as men and the camaraderie
element is important. As for promotion, you don't apply for it: You sit
the appropriate promotion exams, then get on with the job. Meanwhile the
force's staff appraisal system is at work, and people of particular
merit are offered promotion accordingly.
Study is important in any case, in an occupation where one has to be
up to date with changes in the law. Police Constable Dillon is assiduous
in keeping track, and even before joining the force liked to keep fit
through going to the gym and doing weight training. Like all Strathclyde
officers, she received training last year in self-defence, and
particularly the use of the new side-handled baton and rigid handcuffs.
Most of her five-and-a-half years have been spent with R Division,
which covers South Ayrshire, and she has seen duty on the beat, in
mobile patrols, in administration, and even as a member of a
high-profile fast-response unit.
She got married recently and pays tribute to her husband's patience
with her changing shifts. Last month she was transferred from Ayr to the
force's Pitt Street, Glasgow headquarters on a three-month secondment to
the Policy Research Unit, which is studying matters such as the impact
on police services of next year's local government reforms.
''It gives you a valuable insight into senior management,'' she says.
''And I can honestly say that since joining the police force I haven't
looked back.''

EXCELLENCE, John Major told the party faithful in Blackpool 10 days
ago, should be the Conservative watchword; good schools should be
allowed to expand, he said, but bad schools should be closed for failing
their pupils.
In two London boroughs the Prime Minister's words probably hit harder
than anywhere else in the country. Earlier in the week Lambeth and
Waltham Forest became the most notorious boroughs in England with the
announcement by Chris Woodhead, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of
Schools, that all 140 schools in these areas would undergo emergency
inspections.
The extraordinary move followed a series of damaging inspections by
the Office For Standards In Education (Ofsted) the Government agency
headed by Mr Woodhead.
Since inspections began in 1992 more than 4000 schools have been
visited, of which about one in eight have been deemed to be ''failing to
provide satisfactory education''. But in Waltham Forest in East London
four of the 12 schools already inspected were failing, while in Lambeth
in South London five out of 16 were in this category.
''The situation is extremely worrying -- the failing schools must be
identified and identified quickly,'' commented Mr Woodhead when he
announced the move.
Lambeth Council, no stranger to controversy, publicy accepted the
announcement with good grace, welcoming the opportunity to improve the
quality of education in the borough. The broader reaction has been far
less diplomatic, however.
David Blunkett, the shadow education secretary, said the announcement
was a political move instigated by the Department for Education and
Employment to coincide with the start of Tory conference week, and the
local teaching unions are furious.
But the main effect of the announcement has been to bring the whole
vexed issue of failing schools bubbling back to the surface. And with
Raymond Robertson, the Scottish Education Minister, raising the
possibility of Scottish Office measures to weed out failing schools, the
experience south of the Border is well worth watching in Scotland.
Ofsted was set up in 1992 to organise, run and regulate the new
national inspection system. Schools were to be inspected in four-year
cycles, but in the primary sector they were already well behind this
target. Rather than inspections being carried out by local education
authorities they are now put out to competitive tender from independent
teams of inspectors who may come from a variety of backgrounds.
Indeed, by law every team has to include one volunteer lay member who
receives one week's training. The idea as Kenneth Clarke, then education
secretary, put it is to let ''the butcher, the baker and the
candlestick-maker'' become inspectors. In reality most are older, white,
middle-class men.
If an inspection team judges a school to be failing, the school has 40
days to draw up an action plan which must be approved by the Secretary
of State. Often this will involve closing the school completely. If an
action plan is rejected, an Education Association is appointed to take
over the running of the school. This has only happened in one of the 100
or so schools classed as failing -- Hackney Downs, also in London.
But what exactly is a failing school? Inspection teams look at exam
results, quality of learning, and teaching standards as well as
management, discipline and absenteeism before making their decision.
In Lambeth and Waltham Forest, for example, Ofsted says inspectors
found a number of common features in the schools they failed: lax
discipline, teaching methods that ''do not and cannot secure effective
learning'', lack of rigorous leadership by the head teacher, and low
expectations of pupils.
This seems relatively straightforward. Critics claim the process is
fatally flawed, however. They say the particular social circumstances of
each individual school are ignored and in inner-city schools this can be
especially important.
At Mostyn Gardens Primary in Lambeth, which received the most bruising
report so far, 91% of the pupils receive free school meals.
''They impose national norms,'' said Dick North of the Lambeth branch
of the National Union of Teachers. ''They look at what's being achieved
nationally and what's being achieved in the school and then conclude
that the teachers are failing. But if you exchanged all the teachers in
Brixton [part of Lambeth] and Surrey it would show very little
difference.''
Education experts also question whether the fate of a school should
depend on an inspection which lasts just one week. ''There are so many
things about a school that are impossible to pick up in a couple of
days,'' says Nick Tester of Education magazine. Dick North agrees: ''You
get very little sense of what a school is about by reading an Ofsted
report.''
Ofsted is quick to reject such complaints. At the time of the
announcement Chris Woodhead said family background was not an excuse for
under-achievement. ''The greatest problem is low expectations of
pupils,'' an Ofsted spokesman says. ''Teachers don't push them, they
don't test them. There is no reason why pupils in inner city schools
should have a worse education than others. To assume they can't do it is
criminal.''
He says feedback from the vast majority of schools which have
undergone inspection already has been positive. He criticises those in
the ''education establishment'' opposed to Ofsted. ''There is still a
great deal of ignorance and misunderstanding. There were no national
inspections before, so it has been a shock to the system to have a
rigorous national testing system.''
Raymond Robertson has yet to fill in any details of what he intends to
do on the failing schools issue north of the Border, but already he has
ruled out closing schools completely.
As the emergency inspections begin in Lambeth and Waltham Forest in
the new year, however, teachers there will be remembering John Major's
words: ''Of course, closing bad schools means a row,'' he said, ''but
it's the right row to have.''

<HEADLINE>As doubts grow over the value of National Records of Achievement, we ask . . . What's the point?</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>NORMAN DUNSMORE</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

They can be an invaluable personal resource in a variety of situations
related to progress after schoollife, argues NORMAN DUNSMORE.
NATIONAL Records of Achievement were introduced for school-leavers
throughout Britain some four years ago. They consist of nine main pages
in which are detailed its owner's educational, extracurricular and
out-of-school achievements, often accompanied by supporting
documentation such as certificates, testimonials, or records of
education and training.
Their main purposes are:
* To provide a mechanism through which students can be encouraged to
take a greater share of responsibility for their own progress;
* To give students a greater sense of pride in the successes attendant
on that progress;
* To encourage them, on the basis of past success, to set challenging
but attainable personal, academic, and vocational goals to the future;
* To serve a continuous record of achievement through successive
stages of education and training.
The principle that they are written by the young people themselves, in
accordance with regional and national guidelines, and following
counselling by their teachers or tutors, is fundamental to the whole
philosophy of NRAs.
In addition, the associated processes of continuous review and
action-planning are held to be every bit as important as the
end-product.
It was originally hoped that NRAs would also be warmly embraced by
further and higher education trainers and employers as useful, even
essential gateway documents. For the most part, however, with only a few
admirable exceptions and most notably in the further education sector,
this has not been the case.
Ironically, the reason most often given for this neglect is the amount
of personal detail the NRA contains -- the same quality which its
champions perceive to be one of its cardinal virtues. There is simply
too much information, it is disappointingly but perhaps predictably
claimed, for busy gatekeepers and interviewers to read and properly
evaluate.
But of greater concern is how post-school indifference has led to a
feeling -- even among some teachers -- that the NRA is, therefore, a
product which nobody really wants or needs, and that the undeniably
substantial resources of time and technology required in their
successful delivery are increasingly difficult to justify.
This, however, is to miss the point. First and foremost, NRAs are
created about, by, and for the students themselves. When well-made, they
contain a large quantity of personal information already laid out in a
highly structured way and expressed in a very positive tone. They can,
therefore, be an invaluable personal resource in a variety of situations
related to post-school progression, without any outside agency seeing
them or even being directly aware of their existence.
Such situations might include: compiling a cv; applying for a job by
letter; completing a UCAS or other application form; or preparing for an
interview. Furthermore, when applying for several different situations,
the basic information which has to be processed into as attractive a
package as possible might be the same, but would be presented in
different ways with different points of emphasis.
The logical extension of this notion, of course, is that the NRA
document itself should be dynamic, in the sense that parts of it, and
particularly the personal statement and action planning pages, can be
written to make them as relevant as possible to the situation in which
someone, for instance a prospective employer, is actually going to read
it.
Far from being cynical or manipulative, customising an application
form or cv in this way is what the rest of the sensible world does when
trying to sell itself, and nothing more rigid and supposedly definitive
should be expected of youngsters. Customising is also relatively easy to
do, as most NRAs are created on word-processors and stored on the
student's own disk.
It has also been argued that the NRA contains such personal material
that it should only be used as a repository for raw data out of which
more highly finished work can be drawn, and that no-one else should have
access to it all. But this would surely only be reasonable where, for
whatever reason, the document was of poor quality, or where a student
had received so much assistance from a teacher in completing it, that it
gave too flattering a picture of his or her real abilities.
The recent, and very welcome, appointment of an NRA National
Development Officer and reasonably positive reference to NRAs in the
Guidance and papers of the 'Higher Still' Draft Framework suggest that
some kind of formal role is still envisaged for them.
No doubt this will be clarified in two forthcoming documents, the
Scottish CCC paper on 'PSE 5 -- 18' and an HMI-commissioned evaluation.
* Norman Dunsmore is a development officer with TVEI, the
Government-funded programme to introduce more vocational options into
the secondary curriculum.

So says KathrynMarshall as she blazes a professional trail around the
world.Geraldine Abrahamsrecords the cautiouswords of experience.
MOST boys dream of being great sportsmen, following in their heroes'
footsteps. They have no difficulty in nourishing these dreams because
media coverage is so intense that they are conditioned from a very early
age.
But what about girls who dream of a future in the sporting world? How
can they identify with their role models when few female-based sports
are covered by the media and consequently few ''stars'' have the chance
to emerge as role models?
Anyone who follows golf will be able to recite a list of professional
male golfers, but they may have some difficulty moving beyond Nancy
Lopez or Laura Davies when listing the names of successful golfing
women.
Yet the women's professional golf circuit is as hectic as the men's
and while the purses may not be quite as large, many women are making a
very good living from the sport -- especially in the US where coverage
of female matches is increasingly popular.
In Europe, there are signs of change. The ladies' equivalent of the
Ryder Cup -- the Solheim Cup -- has sparked a lot of interest. Another
important factor in kindling interest in professional women's golf in
Europe has been Laura Davies's spectacular rise to number one -- an
inspiration to aspiring champions like Kathryn Marshall, Pam Wright and
Catriona Massie.
Indeed, this year has been the best of Kathryn Marshall's professional
career. She won her first big American tournament in July -- the Jamie
Farr Toledo Classic -- the culmination of a year of scoring consistent,
solid results in matches in Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic
(earnings: more than $130,000).
The average purse in the USA is $500,000 and rises to $1.2 million.
Unlike with the European tournaments where you have to be in the top 10
to make any money, finishing 30th, for example, will assure prize money
of around $4,000.
While the tour proper does not begin until March, running non-stop
until October, the preceding months for Kathryn this year took her to
Florida and Hawaii.
It may sound magical, but the pace is gruelling. First stops on the
tour are Tucson, Phoenix, Palm Springs and Atlanta -- before moving on
to upstate New York, New Jersey, then over to the mid-west to Ohio,
Minnesota. No time for a breath before returning to the Eastern
Seaboard, to Pine Wild in North Carolina, and then right across the
country to California.
''It is like a travelling circus,'' says Kathryn, describing the tour.
''Every week there are 144 players in the field.'' There are 200 players
on the LPG circuit.
This is Kathryn's fifth year as a professional. Before that she played
as a top amateur for a few years. Her family has always had a strong
interest in the sport and Kathryn's move into professional golf seemed
set from the age of six when she played with them at Monifieth near
Dundee.
She continued to improve her skills in her teens and at age 17, with a
scratch handicap, she took up a scholarship to America.
She has represented Scotland and Great Britain at Vagliano in Italy, a
match involving Great Britain and Ireland against the rest of Europe and
played for the Curtis Cup (Great Britain and Ireland against USA) in
1990, the point at which she realised that she wanted to turn
professional.
''I think anyone who does not reach that stage will have a hard job --
you really have to get to that level,'' she says. ''Although there are
other ways of becoming a professional golfer, I would say that you have
to go to America. The motivation comes from the money and from getting
the results.''
Becoming professional does not mean instant inclusion in the
tournaments. For the European Tour, the golfers have to go through a
school -- in Spain.
''That is a good way to get your feet wet, and move into the
professional lifestyle,'' says Kathryn, ''but, in my opinion, it is
easier to play in America. I love playing in Europe, but everything is
laid on for you so conveniently in America.''
Unlike the rocketing 16-year-old stars of sports like tennis, golfers
develop with experience. Kathryn did not become a professional player
until she was 22. ''Golf is very much a mental game and you can only get
that with the experience of years,'' she says.
All that might sound very promising for the many women who are
successful at club level but, as with any sport, there are other factors
involved in being successful at the highly-competitive levels. So how do
you become a successful professional golfer?
''You have to have a very single-minded attitude on the golf course,
and to be able to travel -- to be away from home for long periods -- but
the main, vital quality is dedication.
''You have to have desire and dedication. If you don't have them
together, you won't make it. I struggled earlier in my career with that.
I got married when I was just starting out in my professional career so
there were other things going on.''
Golf can be humbling, she warns. ''You are only as good as your last
game. Last year was wonderful for me, but who knows what's round the
corner?''
If Kathryn's lifestyle sounds idyllic, she quickly knocks that idea
off the tee. She often goes to places like Australia, and sees nothing
more than the airport and the golf course: ''Weather aside, I could be
in Aberdeen.It's a very gruelling schedule.
''We are treated very well, but the tournament can involve four days a
week, with another day taken up with Pro-Am. Then you need a day's
practice to get used to the golf course, so time passes very quickly.''
Kathryn, whose role models are Seve Ballesteros and Nancy Lopez, would
like to see more women's golf tournaments in Scotland, but until the
media coverage reaches a level where, as in America, newspapers carry
the results for every tour on a weekly basis, she fears this is unlikely
to happen.
More women might be encouraged to take up the sport professionally if
the universities in this countries offered courses as they do in the US.
At the moment, only the universities of Stirling and St Andrews have
sports bursars and this naturally limits the opportunity for
inter-university matches, an important factor in the success of such
courses in America.
Kathryn offers this advice to would-be golf professionals . . .
''Set your own goals and make sure you achieve them before you set out
for the big, bad, world. It is a good life if everything goes well, but
it can make or break you.''
* Kathryn Marshall will give golfing lessons at Dalmahoy Golf Club
this Friday, October 27, to the six winners of the competition run by
Payne &amp; Gunter, the VIP Hospitality Caterers who sponsored this year's
Women's Scottish Open.

TRADE MISSION
CHINA'S largest-ever trade mission to Britain arrived in Glasgow this
week -- thanks to the success of the city's town twinning arrangements
with Dalian in north-east China.
The delegation of 90 business people was led by Mayor Bo Xilai of
Dalian, one of China's most influential political leaders outside
Beijing.
In China, mayors are given far more local autonomy than local
politicians in Britain, and Mayor Bo Xilai has used his power to make
the Dalian area one of China's quickest growing industrial areas and one
of the key areas to attract foreign investment.
It is the only city in north-east China with the power to appraise and
approve foreign investment projects without referral to Beijing.
One China expert yesterday said: ''Mayor Bo Xilai is very dynamic, and
benefits also from his father being well connected in Beijing. Mayors
are more powerful individuals in China, and Bo Xilai is seen as a
particularly important mayor.''
Glasgow's links with Dalian began eight years ago, and although town
twinning is often attacked as being little more than paid holidays for
councillors, Glasgow concentrated on industrial centres, not often in
the most tourist-orientated countries, where there was the possiblity of
spin-off business.
Dalian has since turned out to be a most fortuitous choice, as the
Chinese willingness to embrace capitalism and foreign investment has
grown with surprising speed.
Glasgow companies are currently involved in building two power
stations in Dalian, as well as installing traffic light systems,
supplying compressors for the Chinese oil and gas industries, providing
cooling equipment for the catering industry and discussing the provision
of training courses in the financial services sector.
The Dalian connection could have been severed by the West's reaction
to the brutal repression of students at Tiananmen Square in 1989, but
Glasgow politicians took the diplomatic line that they would have no
dealings with Beijing, but that the contacts with Dalian would continue.
Throughout this, the Labour leaders in George Square were backed by
the business leaders at the Chamber of Commerce on the opposite side of
the square. While both sides may disagree politically, both were quick
to agree that the city needed to attract as much business from abroad as
possible.
Various trade missions have been held to Dalian, and now comes the
largest in return, with the 90 Chinese business officials arriving in
Glasgow on Sunday night for two days of intensive meetings and
negotiations arranged in advance with more than 200 Scottish companies
which expressed an interest in meeting the Chinese.
Leading Scots industrialist Lord Weir, chairman of the China Britain
Trade Group (Scotland), yesterday explained the rationale of doing
business with China. He said it was one thing to recognise that China
was a great potential market, but quite another thing to break into that
market and make it an important part of your ongoing business.
He said you first of all had to take the long-term view about China.
It could take up to five years from initial contact to first order. That
meant being willing to devote the necessary resources in money and
personnel over a sufficient period.
Once involved in China, one must recognise that while it is buying a
great deal of foreign products at present, this will not go on
indefinitely, and therefore one should be looking ahead to identify
suitable business partners for joint ventures.
Dalian's position in the north-east has made it a successful entry
point to China for Japanese and Korean businesses sush as Matushita,
Canon, Toshiba and TDK. Last year, American companies made a push into
the region. Now Mayor Bo Xilai wants to do business with Europe -- and
in his eyes that means Glasgow.
As he explained: ''Dalian people's knowledge about Britain is quite
limited. To Dalian people Glasgow is equal to Europe.
''I am confident there's a great potential between the two cities.
China is the best developing country in the world, so I am sure we will
have a lot of opportunities to co-operate with each other.''
To help local firms, Glasgow District Council has a special adviser on
China, David Tully, based in Hong Kong. He said yesterday: ''We are keen
to promote Glasgow as a centre into Europe for the Chinese. They like
dealing with the same people, and that is one of the strengths of
Glasgow because of its links with Dalian.
''We can help smooth the way for businesses through the sister city's
link and through our contacts with the Mayor's office.
''But it is up to the businesses at the end of the day to take
advantage of these links.''

<TEXT>
Toronto, Tuesday -- Canada's financial markets took a pounding,
extending their slide from Friday as speculation mounted that Quebeckers
could vote in favour of leaving Canada in the October 30 sovereignty
referendum.
''The markets had built in a No vote (against separation) and they
were getting very complacent about the No vote issue. And the polls have
shaken that confidence for the time being,'' said Michael Manford, chief
economist at Toronto-based ScotiaMcLeod.
Opinion polls showing support for sovereignty taking the lead in
Canada's French-speaking province scared investors away from Canadian
currency and securities holdings and caused a major erosion in the value
of everything from the Canadian dollar to stocks and bonds.
The Canadian dollar, which has lost almost two US cents since
Thursday, continued to sink and traded as low as 72.73 US cents, down
more than a full US cent from Friday's close at 73.88 US cents.
Traders said the Bank of Canada intervened repeatedly bying Canadian
dollars against the US currency in an effort to halt the dive.
Canada's largest stock market index, the Toronto Stock Exchange's TSE
300, sank more than 113 points to 4325.30, a drop of 2.55% and the
largest single-day decline since February 4, 1994.
''All the interest-sensitive stocks are getting hit here. It's
weakness in the dollar. It's concerns about Quebec,'' one trader said.
The yield on Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose to 8.392%, up from
8.251% at Friday's close and 7.99% last Wednesday. Spreads between long
Canadian and US bonds continued to widen and came close to 200 basis
points, up from 189 on Friday. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage
point.
The selloff began last Thursday after the release of an Angus Reid
poll showing support for Quebec separation leading by 51% to 49%.
Another survey, conducted by pollsters Leger &amp; Leger and published in
the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper on Saturday, concluded that 45.8%
of respondents would vote for secession and 42.2% against.
The poll surveyed 1005 Quebeckers between October 16 and 20, with a
margin of error of 3.1%. About 5.7% of the respondents declined to
answer and 1.7% said they would not vote.
It was the third in a series of weekly polls conducted by Leger &amp;
Leger. The previous Leger poll, published on October 14, showed support
for separation at 45% against 42.4%.
''The Yes (pro-sovereignty side) has gained 5% in less than three
weeks. The Yes definitely has the momentum,'' pollster Jean-Marc Leger
told a Nesbitt Burns investors conference call today. He said, however,
that the edge was still with those opposing separation.
Analysts declined to comment on the market consequences if the
separatists win the referendum. But they said the market faces
tremendous volatility and possible losses in the week ahead.
''I'm not saying there is disaster ahead but the risk rewards are
widely against us right now,'' one Toronto-based market analyst said.
ScotiaMcLeod's Manford said it would be hard to speculate on what will
happen if sovereignty prevails. ''The problem is, there aren't any
rules,'' he said. ''It's very difficult when you've never been here
before and there aren't any rules.'' -- Reuter.

MIRROR Group surprised the City yesterday when it bought 2.4 million
shares in Scottish Television.
The deal believed to be at 512p or 10p above the market, brought the
publishing group's holding to 19.93% -- the approximate level it held
before Scottish agreed its ''strategic alliance'' with the Flextech
cable company in September.
The stock was acquired in the name of the Scottish Daily Record and
Sunday Mail.
US-owned Flextech acquired a 20% holding for #28m cash and the
transfer of its 20% stake in HTV, the Wales and West of England
broadcaster.
That had the effect of diluting the Mirror holding to 16%.
It was originally acquired in two tranches at 520p this time last
year.
Initially Scottish chairman William Brown and managing director Gus
Macdonald turned down several requests by Mirror's chief executive David
Montgomery for board representation. That matter was resolved at the
time of the Flextech transaction and so there seemed to be no particular
hurry for Mirror to make up its holding at a cost of #12.3m.

THE female side of Scotland's two most prominent jazz clans takes over
the scene this week as Sophie Bancroft and Gina Rae undertake their
first national tour at the head of a six-piece band.
Sunday's introduction to this expanded line-up was a gradual affair. A
handful of duo songs set the tone. Bancroft and Rae's partnership is
founded on their own wistful ballads sung in fragile, vulnerable harmony
to Bancroft's uncomplicated acoustic guitar backing.
There are limitations in both dynamics and range of emotional
expression but these are overcome in some measure by the light,
attractive quality of their overall sound, and their willingness to look
towards bossa nova, pop and traditional music for inspiration.
It's a small, but in its own way complete, sound and adding further
instrumentation requires care. Drummer Iain Copeland and bass guitarist
Tom Lyne were almost fastidious in their approach, particularly on the
softly brooding Kingfisher with Lyne shadowing Rae's simplistic keyboard
figure, while trumpeter Colin Steele deserves special mention for coping
with saxophonist Tom Bancroft's tricky horn arrangements at short
notice.
From the soft-focused Illusionary Girl, the ''band'' set built to a
satisfying conclusion, with Work Together's African-influenced refrain
proving especially audience-friendly and The Big Divide, although over
reliant on cliche lyric-wise, taking a tougher stance. There is work to
be done both in developing the music and on the presentation but for a
first tour this was a promising start.

WHEN it comes to outrage, John Osborne got there long before Peter
Tatchell. Thirty years on and even after considerable liberalisation, A
Patriot For Me contains one of the most sensational scenes on the
English stage -- the drag ball of Baron von Epp in which the top and
middle echelons of the Austro-Hungarian army ''come out'' in all their
camp finery.
Even now, it still carries tremendous political force and theatrical
frisson, not only because Dennis Quilley, as he showed in Privates on
Parade, makes a superbly sensitive ''dame'', but also because Peter
Gill, the director, conceives it as a direct confrontation with the
audience and its prejudices -- a chorus line of maligned outsiders
telling their stories and showing their humanity.
Given the current furore about gays and the armed forces it's not hard
to see why this account of the rise and fall of the homosexual army
captain turned spy, Alfred Redl, would seem timely.
Sexuality, though, in Osborne's uneven play isn't the only taboo. Deep
and insidious anti-semitism and the corrosive effect of lies and
subterfuge on a clever but social outsider are also at issue here.
Unfortunately, Gill's reverential production gives full rein to the
one (the homoerotic charge) but fairs less well in other respects. The
claustrophobic yet excluding values of the Austro-Hungarian elite
remains sketchily transmitted.
In a large cast of athletic young men (and one or two women), Diana
Hardcastle is spiky but heartfelt as the countess sent to entrap Redl
while James Wilby's increasingly careless Redl is a portrait of immense,
quiet subtlety.

NIGEL Charnock describes The Second Coming as his final horrific
cabaret. Certainly it feels like the end of a phase -- as though even
the high-voltage Charnock had reached exhaustion. Perhaps even the
pleasure of parading your pain in public has its limitations.
But what a parade it's been. Though The Second Coming, largely a
repeat of his last show, Hell Bent, plus snippets from his other solo
shows Resurrection and Original Sin, feels like too many repetitions of
the one routine, there is still evidence of the talent that is Nigel
Charnock -- the Andy Warhol/Eddie Izzard cross-dressing dancer-singer of
his day.
His new, apocalyptic ending would seem to suggest finality. ''We are
meat,'' sings pianist Nicholas Skilbeck as Charnock slams himself naked
to the floor, his body contorted in a vocabulary that speaks of despair,
supplicancy, vulnerability. ''I am diseased, I am a carrier.'' Does he
refer to himself or the human animal in general with its insatiable
needs, lusts, wants, its egotistical ''I'', its combatative sexualities
which The Second Coming illustrates with such obsession.
But at his best he remains unsurpassable -- a brilliant synthesiser
and executor of ideas, words and dance movement -- a spell-binding diva
when he wants to turn up the heat (his drop-dead Garbo song after the
interval, is camp at its most svelte).
The man is, without question, a genius -- but where does he go from
here?

<HEADLINE>Remarks that he would set up rival to Direct Line seen as admission that Royal Bank is ripe for a bid. Wood's threat may deter predators</HEADLINE>

PETER Wood's threat to abandon Direct Line and set up a rival
telephone insurance business, in the event of a hostile takeover of
Royal Bank of Scotland, could deter potential bidders for the bank.
Mr Wood is the largest individual private shareholder in Royal Bank
and chief executive of its highly successful Direct Line insurance,
mortgages and financial services business.
Some City analysts say his remarks in an interview with the Financial
Times amount to an admission by the bank that it is a takeover target.
Alternatively, Mr Wood may be signalling that any bidder for Royal
Bank will have to deal with him first.
Some analysts believe that any predator would have to pay a premium of
50% of Royal Bank's #4200m market capitalisation in order to mount a
successful bid.
It would not, therefore, wish to endanger Direct Line, which is the
UK's largest motor insurer and is highly profitable.
One industry expert, who did not wish to be named, yesterday described
Mr Wood's comments as ''slightly odd''.
He added: ''They seemed to add credibility to the view that Royal Bank
viewed itself as a target.''
Mr Wood's contract with Royal Bank contains a get-out clause in the
event of a takeover. His initial three-year contract expires in January
1997, after which he will be on 12 months' notice.
Mr Wood's contract provides that, unless he was given permission by
Royal Bank, he could not set up a rival to Direct Line for 12 months if
he was to depart.
However, a Royal Bank official yesterday revealed: ''If there is a
takeover, the 12-month restriction doesn't apply. It is a matter of
weeks.''
The official claimed this takeover get-out was a ''pretty standard
clause''.
However, it would allow Mr Wood, if he wished, to proceed swiftly with
his threat of building his Privilege direct-selling motor insurance
operation, set up with Royal Bank last year, into a competitor to Direct
Line.
Mr Wood, if he was not in favour of any new owner, would have the
right to buy Privilege from Royal Bank, or the new owner, at an
independent valuation.
In his interview with the Financial Times, Mr Wood, who has netted a
#50m-plus fortune from pioneering the direct selling of motor insurance
by telephone, said: ''Taking apart your own creation (Direct Line) would
not be easy. I hope never to have to do that.''
Hugh Pye, banking analyst at BZW, believed Mr Wood was warning any
party which wanted to make a hostile bid that they would have
difficulties put in their path.
Johnny Delahey, analyst at SG Strauss Turnbull, said: ''I think what
he has done is put a warning shot out -- that he wouldn't be that happy
with someone else in charge.
''It is probably a slight deterrent to anyone else.''
Although Direct Line yesterday confirmed its creator's comments, Mr
Wood was himself unavailable for a comment.
Royal Bank shares lost 5p to 524p, having recovered most of their
early losses by the end of the session. They fared better than many in
the banking sector.
Although the takeover speculation, seemingly sparked by news of the
Lloyds-TSB merger, continues, there is still no sign of any bidder.
The apparent favourites, Midland parent HSBC Holdings and BAT
Industries, yesterday declined to comment.
Although BAT Industries confirmed it was still looking for something
in the financial services sector in the UK or Continental Europe, it
refused to comment on the market rumours surrounding Royal Bank.
NatWest, seen as another potential bidder, also declined comment.
Spain's Banco Santander, which has a 9.9% stake in Royal Bank, said its
alliance with the Scottish bank was being ''maintained in its present
terms''.
Referring to Mr Wood's threat, John Tyce at SG Strauss Turnbull, said:
''His bluff may well be called and it's one thing to start (a new
venture on the same model) when there's no likely competitors but now
there are. It's unusual to repeat the success on the same scale.''
Mr Pye, who thinks the recent surge in Royal Bank's share price merely
brings it to a value which reflects fundamentals, believes the bank can
remain ''pretty successful'' on its own for a number of years.
He did not rule out a merger but considered a hostile bid from one of
the other big banks fairly unlikely.
There is a growing feeling that Royal Bank has gone off the idea of
buying a building society, either because there is nothing of the right
size or the prices are too great.
One industry insider believes the fact that Royal Bank is selling
mortgages through Direct Line could be another reason for this.
Royal Bank, however, said yesterday that it would still be interested
in the right deal at the right price with the right building society.

I SUPPOSE it shouldn't be a great surprise that Peter Hall's
production of Ibsen's Master Builder aims for a monumental style.
However, the combination of Ibsen's late period mysticism and Hall's
current directorial approach produces a more than ponderous edifice that
never rises above commonplace.
Ibsen pioneered many thematic and stylistic elements that have now
been thoroughly assimilated into the currency of television and theatre.
This has the unfortunate effect that his plays can now seem formulaic
and cliched rather than ground breaking. So it needs a firm and subtle
directorial hand to bring out the enduring power and contemporary
elements of the plays.
Unfortunately, Peter Hall's approach allows this discussion-based play
to become static. The production moves with glacial speed, and never
achieves a satisfactory rhythm.
Actors pause portentously in mid utterance, or deliberate between
sentences, in ways that are presumably meant to indicate deep thought.
But it often looks more as though they are having difficulties with
their lines. Victoria Hamilton plays Hilde Wangel effectively as an
early wild child and proto hippie. Gemma Jones has a particularly
thankless role as the long-suffering wife but manages to convey
effectively some of the inner turmoil that escapes Alan Bates who never
seemed fully at ease with the difficult role of the obscurely
guilt-ridden master builder.
This production fits beautifully into that increasingly problematic
category of the well-padded West-end revival: star dramatist, star
director, and star actors. The result is as fine an example of what
Peter Brook called deadly theatre as you could hope to avoid.

A NEW European wide report on competitiveness out today from Coopers &amp;
Lybrand shows that while businesses in Scotland suffer from the same
competitive pressures as other parts of the UK, there are some notable
differences from the general UK findings.
Overall, there is a greater intensity of competition as compared to
the rest of the UK.
There is also a large number of growing companies, and Scotland sees
the Middle East as a more important market. Additionally, the perceived
level of Government support for the Scottish sample's key rival
companies is larger.
There is also stronger support in Scotland for EMU and the Single
Currency, with greater stability and easier trading more prominent as
factors in favour of these developments, outweighing the loss of
sovereignty, the key concern elsewhere for a Single Currency.
Frank Blin, managing partner for Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Scotland, said:
''Despite the high levels of competition, the Scottish sample has a
large number of rapidly growing companies. Only 17% of respondents
experienced xero or negative turnover between 1990 and 1995 compared
with 33% for the UK as a whole.''
The main reason for the increase are believed to be increased price
competition from EU and other overseas countries. The EU is seen to be
the greatest source of competition for companies in Scotland.
Unlike the rest of the UK, companies in Scotland see Government
support as a source of their main rivals' competitive advantage. This is
true for exporters and companies which compete with other UK companies.
Additional key areas of competitive advantage include price, strong
domestic markets, and economies of scale.
In terms of their own competitive advantage, companies in Scotland and
throughout the UK did not state price as one of their own competitive
advantages. It remains to be seen whether this is due to a deliberate
non-price competition strategy or if it reflects a failure to meet price
competition.
While, along with the UK in general, the EU is seen as the most
important current export market for Scotland, the Middle East is
considered to be an important market for 31% of companies, a much higher
figure than for the UK as a whole.
By the year 2000, the EU and the Middle East are still expected to be
main export markets, although slightly less important than before, along
with South- east Asia and North America. Apart from the importance of
the Middle East, this mirrors the findings for other areas.
Scottish companies have a more positive attitude towards a single
currency with 67% of the sample in favour, against 54% for the UK as a
whole. Nearly one in four companies believes that a single currency
would make it simpler to trade and would result in greater stability in
the economy while 13% think that it would contribute to creating a more
level playing field.
The main disadvantages of a single curency are perceived to be the
loss of sovereignty and the problems associated with the actual process
of getting to a single currency.
From the Scottish viewpoint, businesses face a strong and growing
competitive environment. Coopers &amp; Lybrand concludes: ''Given the
strength of price as a driving force, a key strategic issue for Scottish
companies to address is whether their reliance on industry experience
will be sufficient as a source of competitive advantage to enable them
to withstand price competition from their main rivals.''

The NDT2 is the 'if only' group for young dancers: Mary Brennan
profiles a dynamic ensemble making its only Scottish appearance this
week.
FOR hundreds of young dancers across the globe, NDT2 is the ''if only
. . .'' company. If only they can win through the rigorous selection
process, if only they can make limbs and mind rise above audition
nerves, if only they can show enough maturity at 17 . . . then they too
can enter the extraordinary creative kingdom of Jiri Kylian and
Nederlands Dans Theater.
What makes Kylian and his company so special? Quite simply, they are
world leaders. Their entire organisation -- the main company NDT, is
flanked by a youth wing, NDT2 and by NDT3, a small body of mature
performers from the 40-plus age group -- has consistently influenced the
profile of contemporary dance worldwide since the mid-seventies.
Kylian's choreography, with its intense musicality and ingenious
moods, has not only captured the hearts and heads of audiences
everywhere, it has proved a mettlesome primer for dancers themselves.
You can't turn up and go through the moves in a Kylian piece. You must
go inside the music, hear it and feel it -- the little tricks of wit in
Mozart, the sharp intake of remembered grief in Janacek -- and then meld
emotional and intellectual understanding into choreography, which makes
uncompromising demands on every aspect of the dancer's technique and
stamina.
And whereas other companies might look to produce well-disciplined
lines of dancing clones, NDT and its offshoots prefer to nurture
individuality, to arrive at a well-knit ensemble where there are no
stars but everyone is a soloist of note.
It is this freedom to develop as an individual which attracts so many
of the finest dancers to the NDT2 auditions once a year in January.
Paul Lightfoot, a former NDT2 member who has graduated to the main
company and diversified into choreography, is only now realising the
difference the company has made to his career. Coming back to England
for visits, catching up with his contemporaries who, like him, trained
at the Royal Ballet School, leaves him sad and yet relieved.
Sad at what he sees as the waste of potential: ''I just know that, in
my group, there were definitely people with the talent to express
themselves creatively, people who had something to give to the dance.
And it's just like rotting fruit. You can see they've gone to waste,
because there just hasn't been the opportunity or the encouragement to
push and develop.''
To his relief, things were done differently in the Netherlands.
Initially, NDT2 was very much a ''feeder'' enterprise, geared to ensure
a flow of new recruits for the main company, Nederlands Dans Theater,
but more and more, the youth wing acquired its own international
reputation for breathtaking quality.
Kylian and his associates encouraged the dancers, whose ages range
from 17 to 21, to go beyond learning other peoples' steps and company
repertoire and experiment with their own ideas.
For Lightfoot, the leap came at one of NDT2's annual workshops. Kylian
saw a piece he had choreographed and encouraged him to go further. Since
then, Lightfoot has made work for the main company, as well as for NDT2
and 3. His recent piece, Solitaire, is part of the programme NDT2 is
bringing to the MacRobert Arts Centre in Stirling at the end of the
week.
What happened to Lightfoot is, according to NDT2's company manager
Carmen Thomas, absolutely par for the course. ''This is definitely not a
place to stand still,'' she says firmly.
''Our young people are constantly surrounded by brilliant
practitioners, they are always seeing something they can aspire to,
something they have to work hard to achieve in themselves. And yes, we
make those demands on them. They have to search deep in their young
souls to be able to remain with this company.''
The result is a company of 14 dancers whose poise and ability outshine
many a dancer with more apparent experience. NDT2 is a hard school but
it produces people who know not just how to dance but why they are
dancing and what it is they can communicate through their bodies.
Nor is it likely young British talent will ever break out of the
current mould Paul Lightfoot so deplores unless someone takes the
initiative to implement the attitudes of NDT2, take it as a role model.
If only . . . In the meantime, one can look and long at the MacRobert
this week.
* NDT2 make their only Scottish appearance at the MacRobert Arts
Centre, Stirling University, on Friday and Saturday , 7.30pm.

SEEBOARD, the regional electricity company (REC), is set to mount a
serious challenge to British Gas in the domestic gas market through a
link-up with Amoco, the major oil group.
The two are forming a joint venture which will the first such project
to compete head-on with British Gas, at present the monopoly supplier to
all but the largest domestic consumers. This is set to change, with the
market scheduled to become fully open to competition in 1998.
''We fully expect to offer all domestic consumers nationally very,
very good value, a very good range of products and price discounts
initially estimated at 10% -- or a bit more,'' said Stephen Gutteridge,
Seeboard's managing director of supply.
The practicalities of having a free-for-all in the domestic market, in
terms of ensuring safety and continuity of supply, will be tested in a
pilot scheme organised by the Government and Ofgas, the industry
regulator, beginning next April.
This will involve 500,000 gas consumers in Cornwall, Devon and
Somerset. A year later a further 1.5 million consumers in Sussex, Kent,
Dorset, and Avon will join in. The gas will be transported through the
existing pipelines of British Gas's Transco transportation side which
has had to become a separate business within the group. Other gas
suppliers will pay Transco to deliver their gas and the latter's prices
will be limited by Ofgas.
The trials will be to Seeboard's advantage as its electricity supply
area is in South-east England, extending into Greater London. It has two
million customers.
The original timetable for domestic competition called for a much
longer transition period but the Government telescoped this so that
British Gas could be exposed to competition within its major market as
soon as possible.
Commercial and industrial users can already choose their supplier and
the regulatory regime forced British Gas to compete with one hand tied
behind its back. As a result, its share is down to 35% and only since
June has it been able to compete on equal terms.
The #6000m domestic market comprises 20 million consumers using on
average #300 worth of gas a year. Amoco will make long-term supplies
available to the joint venture from the North Sea gas fields it operates
as well as from fields it has interests in. It is aiming to build up its
reverves through an ''aggressive'' exploration strategy.
''The joint venture will be our principal UK outlet for substantial
quantities of competitively-priced gas from our own reserves over the
next 10 to 15 years,'' said Mike Ambrose, managing diector of Amoco
Western Europe Gas.
Seeboard will bring its customer information systems and service
experience to the venture. It has been looking to expand into gas in a
big way for some time and has a small existing company, Southern Gas,
which is 25%-owned by UtiliCorp United, a US utility.
This stake has now been bought by Seeboard. For its part, Amoco looked
at other electricity companies before deciding on Seeboard and the deal
took a year to negotiate.
''It is as far as we can tell the top-rated REC in terms of standards
and costs,'' noted Mr Ambrose.

EXCLUSIVE
THE United States could have prevented the fall of the Bosnian Muslim
''safe haven'' of Srebrenica in July and the subsequent alleged mass
execution of up to 8000 men and boys of fighting age, according to
intelligence sources.
Washington had clear evidence from intercepted telephone conversations
that the Serbs planned an all-out assault, and photographic details of
the massing of tank and artillery units in the vicinity of the enclave.
It deliberately failed to pass on details of its intelligence
gathering to either the United Nations or Nato, sources claim.
The fall of the town paved the way for the collapse of the UN's
protection zone policy for the six original Bosnian enclaves. It also
led to the decisive intervention of US-led airpower and the shuttle
diplomacy of US mediator Richard Holbrooke in September.
US intelligence allegedly had beenmonitoring telephone conversations
between Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic in Pale and Serbia's
army chief of staff, General Pericic, in Belgrade for more than three
weeks before the final assault began, and was aware of military plans
for the operation from mid-June.
In addition, its unmanned spy-planes and satellite surveillance had
photographs of the deployment and build-up of Serb armour, infantry, and
artillery around the threatened area.
About 300 lightly-armed Dutch soldiers serving with the UN Protection
Force (UNPROFOR) as a tripwire defensive screen for the town were put at
risk as the Serbs launched their five-day attack. They were finally
forced to surrender to avoid being overrun or wiped out as Muslim
resistance crumbled.
UNPROFOR's own intelligence about the movements of the warring sides
was limited to covert ground patrols by people like the UK's SAS.
Without aerial and signals' information, however, it could only make an
educated guess at the shape of the big picture.
Officers serving at UNPROFOR headquarters in the Croatian capital of
Zagreb at that time are understood to be bitter about what they see as a
cynical betrayal of the UN operation by their American allies.
Other sources say that Belgrade, supposedly playing a neutral role in
the conflict to avoid further international sanctions, set the entire
Bosnian Serb strategy of snuffing out the UN safe havens.
More than 3000 Muslim males aged between 16 and 60 were seen by
refugees being taken away in trucks from Srebrenica and have not been
seen since. Another 5000 are still unaccounted for more than three
months later.
So far, Washington has published only one aerial shot of a possible
mass grave north of the town. Sources claim, however, that they are
withholding pictures of the actual massacre itself.

THE DIFFICULT CHILD, Dr Stanley Turecki, Piatkus, #8.99.
* TWO to six-year-olds are notoriously temperamental and difficult,
which can reduce the calmest parents to gibbering wrecks. There are two
schools of thought on the subject, with the first promoting good
old-fashioned routines and discipline, and the second advocating
professional counselling in every situation.
The truth probably lies midway between the two. The majority of
children will respond to simple rules and calm and consistent dealing
with problems, but there are undoubtedly some children whose
temperamental behaviour has more deep rooted causes, and therefore need
further attention.
Dr Turecki details the different character traits of truly
''difficult'' children and provides management techniques to promote
more beneficial interactions. In particular, the old idea that the
child's behaviour is the ''fault'' of the parents is completely turned
around; parents must stop blaming themselves and accept that the child
affects their behaviour and attitude in the same way as they influence
the child. The aim is to improve family relationships by identifying
behaviour patterns and coping with specific difficulties.
There has been some recent publicity about professional mishandlings
or diagnosis of children with various disorders which could be labelled
difficult. Armed with this book, parents might feel more confident about
demanding help. For all the other parents with typically irritating
terrible twos and above, sections on poor sleeping habits and picky
eaters would be equally invaluable.
THE NAME BOOK, Pierre le Rouzic, Souvenir Press, #10.99.
* WOULD you believe a book which claims that names define our
personalities? More to the point, would you be able to resist it? After
discovering that I am apparently exciting and unpredictable, with a
powerful intellect and more than a touch of intuition, I was totally
hooked. Nine thousand names are grouped together under 79 types, with
quick reference charactergrams, and make a refreshing change from the
usual Boys' Names/Girls' Names so beloved of expectant parents.
Perhaps most importantly, Kylie does not feature anywhere.
BABY MASSAGE, Peter Walker, Piatkus, #9.99.
* THIS book is worth buying for the photographs alone. It is relaxed,
easy to follow, and based entirely on the benefits of touch. Research
has already shown that massage is vital for children with special needs
and babes under-developed at birth, so making it a normal part of life
for every baby makes sense.
However, like any exercise regime, it is undoubtedly best if done
regularly, and practise is important. At this point I must confess that
during the past few years I have tried and failed to introduce massage
to both my children. Either I'm extremely bad at it, or they are
particularly tickly, because both times I've ended up with a helplessly
giggling baby. At least when I gave up this time I could still coo over
the photos of children with smarter parents.
VEGETARIAN BABY AND CHILD, Petra Jackson, Headline, #9.99.
* SPEAKING as a non-vegetarian, this could be the book which converts
me. Every day interesting tasty dishes crying out to be tested. So we
did, and will be doing so again and again. Excellent.
BIGGER IDEAS FROM COLOUR ME BEAUTIFUL, Mary Spillane, Piatkus, #15.99
hardback.
* SELF help books are good at inspiring a temporary surge of
enthusiasm, but it's rare to find one which manages to continue the
momentum. The introduction was interesting but it was downhill all the
way thereafter.
Some of the subjects covered could reduce the most confidant woman to
an insecure wreck. ''Heavy arms'' had me mesmerised -- can anyone
honestly claim that the quality of their life is marred by the shape of
their upper arm? And was it absolutely necessary to have a paragraph
covering the number and type of rings suitable for a large woman?
This is meant to encourage size 16-plus women to look and feel good. I
found it patronising and at times utterly ridiculous. Never having felt
the urge to roll up my sleeves to show off my ''lovely forearms''. The
only part I really enjoyed was comparing the suitably glum expressions
on ''before'' pictures with the radiant ''after'' smiles.

Carol Clewlow witnesses a new production which uses rebirth as an
uplifting anthem for youth.
VICTORIA Wood said recently: ''If theatre isn't life-enhancing, what's
the point of it? To make your bottom sore?'' Full marks then for
Northern Stage's new production, The Nest of Spices. Life-enhancement is
its very raison d'etre, and since it is a promenade piece, there are no
worries on the latter score.
There's a certain extra dimension to theatre performed to a purpose.
It catches in the throat. It's as if the thing is driven by a slightly
different engine, an image which particularly fits The Nest of Spices
performed as it is in the Northern Electric power house which once
served the now defunct Swan Hunter shipyard.
At first glance the title seems peculiarly twee for a piece staged in
such glowering industrial surroundings, but when the programme reveals
that it comes from the Arabian myth of the phoenix, that it was the
great bird's own nest of spices which it fanned with its wings to bring
itself back into life, then all becomes clear.
The show's genesis was a frantic phone call made by a Wallsend head
teacher to Olivia Grant, chief executive of Tyneside Training and
Enterprise Council the day after it was announced that Swan Hunter had
finally gone into receivership. His message was that he and the rest of
his staff were facing something of a crisis with their GCSE pupils.
The pupils, who had all but downed pens, were demanding an answer to a
simple question. The examinees wanted to know on what grounds gaining
their GCSE's would improve their job prospects when the last example of
work on the Tyne had finally dried up. Two years, 150 workshops at 25
local schools, and the hopes and fears of 1000 young people later, comes
The Nest of Spices.
A blacked-out bus ride which carries the audience from the Newcastle
Playhouse, home of Northern Stage, to the old Swan's power house where
they move from station to station in the company of a narrator.
Director Richard Gregory has kept his young audience in mind, his
model the pop video, which has made the generations which have grown up
with it intensely image-literate, able to accept and appreciate an image
in isolation without necessarily seeking connections.
Because of this, The Nest of Spices is particularly rich in images:
white silk roses sprouting in the great bed of coal which stretches half
the length of the building; a poignantly-lit display of Beckettian work
boots behind glass; a long thin carpet of what might be grandparently
detritus; old pearls, handbag, glasses swept slowly and inexorably along
by a ghostly figure.
Three teenagers dance round a joyrider's car, up-ended and suspended
on chains like some tortured corpse. At the same time, through Jeff
Young's poetic and richly image-laden script, the scene becomes an urban
Kubla Khan with narrator describing ''the broken lager bottles
glittering like diamonds''.
If this were the only thought-provoking image in the piece, it would
be worth the trip. It says something important about the problem the
adult world often has in understanding the generation that comes after
it. It says the harsh truth is actually the gentlest, that beauty really
is in the eye of the beholder. It says the word joy in the term joyrider
is one which should be taken seriously.
Grant, whose business is working with the young jobless, was adamant
that she did not want what she describes as ''a Hallelujah chorus'' at
the end. That she knew would only be treated with disdain by her young
audience. Designer Simon Banham has, though, on Gregory's instigation,
added a coda, a world of sweet-smelling turf after the wasteland,
followed by a walk out into the light via a bright white corridor.
The Nest of Spices treads a difficult path in seeking to restore to
the young the notion of the essential dignity of the heavy industrial
work which they know about through their fathers and grandfathers, but
which the world has shown quite brutally it no longer values, while at
the same time helping them to embrace fully the new world in which it
does not figure.
That it succeeds is in many ways due to the place in which it is set.
It is the power house itself whch emerges as the star. Theatrically lit,
it soars like a Gothic cathedral, discarded wooden cable spools take on
the persona of huge altars. Mysterious ironwork and walkways and
machinery half-hidden in the dark all play their part in humbling the
audience and engendering that very respect for the heavy industrial life
whch was part of the piece's design.
Tyneside TEC deserve great credit for originating The Nest of Spices
and funding it. For two weeks the young people whose hopes and fears
made it, have had the chance to see it. Now it is the turn of the
public, but only to Saturday. It deserves a longer run.

* A MAJOR credit-rating agency downgraded its opinion of Daiwa Bank
yesterday, saying that a $1100m bond trading scandal at the Japanese
bank is compounding existing troubles from bad loans.
Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Group lowered the bank's long-term ratings
to BBB from A-minus. That is just one category above speculative or
''junk'' grade but still several category notches away. Daiwa's
short-term ratings dropped to A3 from A2.

PACKAGING
PACKAGING and printing group MY Holdings remains committed to
acquisition and to increasing its market share using the synergies from
co-operation and cross-selling by its three major divisions.
It has been remarkably successful in passing on raw material price
increases to the extent that operating margins from the on-going
operations rose from 9.4% to 12% -- partly due to the purchase of the
PropharmaPak for #22.1m last November. That increased its exposure to
the healthcare market with paper-based packaging components.
Overall group turnover increased 51% to #77.1m while pre-tax profits
leapt 102% to #9.1m.
However, helped by the #24.2m rights issue just after the acquisition,
earnings per share increased by just 16% to 5.2p. As a result of that
deal, the controlling Malbak South African packaging company saw its
stake diluted to 64%.
Chief executive John Monks yesterday said that one of the strategic
objectives is to develop positions in markets with better than average
returns and where MY can be a sufficiently influential player to have
more control over its future.
The food and consumer sector brought in 40% of sales and 44% of
operating profits from the continuing businesses. However, pressure from
the supermarkets to reduce costs meant that overall profitability in
this sector was below that elsewhere.
Healthcare contributed 20% of turnover and 34% of profits including
eight months from PharmaPak although contract packaging was below
expectations but is should see good growth with a concentration on drug
cartons and patient information leaflets in a sector expanding by 8%
annually.
Industrial packaging brought in the remainder of the business.
The dividend total has been raised a quarter to 2p with a 1.4p final.

ECONOMY
BRITAIN'S economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter of 1995, the same
level as the second quarter, to give an annualised increase in GDP of
2.4%. This is down from 2.8% in the second quarter after faster growth
in 1994 dropped out of the calculation, but was much as expected in
financial markets.
The preliminary figures were instantly seized upon as justifying the
Chancellor's view that growth was continuing but at a more sustainable
level. The rates of growth were unchanged on the headline figures after
stripping out the volatile oil and gas constituents.
The figures made little impression in share markets or currency
markets. The turmoil on the foreign exchanges, where political worries,
especially in France and Italy, saw money continuing to be switched into
the soaring German mark at the expense of other currencies, was one
factor behind falling share prices along with Wall street, uncertainty
ahead of today's CBI Industrial Trends survey, and tommorrow's gilts
auction.
However, the FTSE-100 Share Index, no longer artificially boosted by
takeover fever but with futures acting as a cushion and trading pretty
thin, recovered much of the ground lost to close 19.9 points lower at
3531.5 having been 40.5 down at one stage.
GDP out-turn means that the economy has grown for 14 successive
quarters since the low point of the recession in the first quarter of
1992. The Central Statistical Office said output was up by 9.5% since
then.
The CSO said it is estimated that the output of manufacturing
industries has continued to grow, although at a lower rate than a year
ago. The output of service industries overall is also estimated to have
continued to grow, though again at a lower rate than in 1994.
In the City, the figures were generally welcomed. Securities house
James Capel's Adam Cole said they confirmed that, for the second quarter
in succession, the economy expanded in line with its long-term
sustainable growth rate.
He said, though, that the data have no implications for policy with
next month's Budget, the main determinant of when interest rates can
fall. Goldman Sachs' Martin Brookes said the rate of growth is in line
with the UK's historic trend rate of growth of around 2.25% and the
economy at present is growing at a sustainable rate. Although the full
figures on then output breakdown of GDP are not yet available it appears
that the service sector was the strongest source of growth.
He believes, though, that despite the more positive outlook over the
longer term, the slowing in economic growth in the near term and the
recent sign of a moderation in medium-term inflationary pressures may
well be enough to prompt the Chancellor into a small easing in monetary
policy before next spring.

INVESTMENTS
EDINBURGH Dragon Trust has been caught out badly, channelling too much
money into the volatile economies of Thailand, Indonesia and the
Philipines and not enough into stable Hong Kong.
Net asset value plunged 15% in the year to August 31 as the Mexican
financial crisis sent shock waves across the Pacific.
This meant that the trust seriously underperformed its benchmark, the
MSCI Combined Asia Free excluding Japan Index, which declined only
12.4%.
As usual, there was no dividend, since the main object of the trust is
high capital growth.
The prospects for this year are uncertain, with opinion divided as to
how the economic resurgence in Japan will will affect the rest of Asia.
Helen Fallow, head of the Pacific department at Edinburgh Fund
Managers, said many fund managers would probably switch investments from
Asian emerging economies into Japan in the short term.
But she remains ''cautiously optimistic'' of an upturn in other Asian
stock markets where Edinburgh Dragon Trust has #319.6m of investments,
particularly if inflationary pressures are brought under control.
Ms Fallow said the trust would probably play to caution, building up
its investments in stable economies such as Hong Kong, South Korea and
Taiwan, while restricting its exposure to more risky ones such as
Malaysia, where interest rates may rise yet further.
Edinburgh Dragon Trust has virtually trebled its investments in Hong
Kong over the past nine months. These now represent 28% of its
portfolio, the same as Thailand, the Philipines and Indonesia together.
These countries were worst hit by the ripple effect of the Mexican
crisis, but exposure to them remains little changed in the hope that
they will soon fully recover.

Music
WHERE once Sir Edwyn followed the path of jocular self-deprecation
even unto the woeful slough of self-willed defeat, last night he
demonstrated his new-found capacity to enjoy the fruits of victory
conferred upon him by the worldwide chart success of Never Met A Girl
Like You Before.
Sure, oor ain gangling Edwyn still refuses to take himself seriously,
but no longer can anyone be in any doubt about the serious enjoyment to
be gleaned from his music. Songs? Edwyn's got 'em. Meaty, beaty
toe-tappers. The skewed punk-funk of Bridge. Power-pop past-blasters
like Felicity.
Pithy songs; literate songs. Songs which manage to be genuinely
melancholy without being self-pitying or arch. Songs worthy of Hank
Williams, if Hank Williams had been educated at Bearsden Academy, that
is.
We gorged on Gorgeous George. We stood up and frugged defiantly to
What Presence, ignoring return-to-your-seats instructions issued by the
Pavilion's bully-boy stewards. Don't Shilly Shally? We shimmy'd and
shook.
Edwyn's voice? More certain than of yore, stentorian rather than
wispily mannered. Edwyn's band? Blisteringly cool. Deft not daft. Paul
Cook, Claire Kenny, and Steve Skinner, we salute you.
Edwyn's self-parodying sense of humour? Still intact, but no longer
something Edwyn uses as an excuse to paint himself into a corner.
Ironically, the jokey concluding version of Edwyn's previous big hit,
Rip It Up, underlined the point. Tricked out in retro-disco threads, it
served to emphasise how far Edwyn has travelled. We've met all too few
blokes like Edwyn before, dash it.

EVERYONE has a soft spot, and mine is for seeing anodyne showbiz
celebrities in empty-headed West End farces. Just the idea of Lionel
Blair starring in a Ray Cooney hospital romp strikes me as funny. Not
funny in quite the way it was intended, admittedly; more funny because I
get a perverse enjoyment from watching larger-than-life personalities
waft around in a world that is clearly not our own. But I have to say,
It Runs in the Family scores pretty highly on its own terms too.
Cooney is at his best when it comes to structure. He knows that farce
is all about mechanics, and if you turn the right cogs and wind the
right springs, the whole thing will zip off with an irrepressible logic
of its own. It's really noticeable, in fact, that all the worst gags --
and there are some stinkers -- have nothing to do with plot, while all
the best gags -- and there are some crackers -- are fundamentally tied
in with the action.
That said, Cooney sails perilously close to the wind with a story --
some nonsense about a doctor who is told about an illegitimate son 18
years after the event and feels he has to cover it up -- in which the
principal characters don't have enough at stake to justify their manic
behaviour.
There's little real danger, and the show's success owes a tremendous
amount to the convincing smoke-screen blown up by Blair, Tim
Brook-Taylor and a gang of TV names -- not to mention a bouncy
performance from Gregory Haiste who, having last appeared in Europe and
Away at the Traverse, is on a career trajectory of frankly farcical
proportions.

IN the early 1970s, I spent three months in Brockport, a small town in
the apple-growing region of upper New York state, west of the
Adirondacks, north of the Finger Lakes, home to one of the many campuses
which made up the sprawling state university.
I was there to teach summer school. My graduate class, comprising
practising junior and high school teachers working in their holidays
towards a second degree, was devoted to a comparative study of the
British educational system.
This was the decade following the 1963 Robbins Report on doubling the
numbers in higher education and Labour's 1965 introduction of
comprehensive secondary schooling. Our educational system remained in
considerable ferment. But only a small minority of my American students
had ever ventured across the Atlantic. Abroad, for them then, was a
weekend trip to Toronto.
I wanted to give them some flavour of the educational issues and
challenges being addressed in Britain and of the cussedly class-ridden
culture in which such radical change was being attempted. So, to
supplement the litany of official reports and organisational charts, I
asked them to read Lucky Jim.
Kingsley Amis's first published novel was already nearly 20 years old
by then. But its coruscating, comic portrayal of life in an English
red-brick university after the war seemed to have everything I needed to
imbue the dry dissection of our school and university system with some
life, colour, and meaning.
''Lucky'' Jim Dixon may not have been a truly angry young man, no more
than an oblique role model for Jimmy Porter, Arthur Seaton, and Joe
Lampton. But the way junior lecturer Dixon's working-class angst wreaked
havoc with academic snobbery and the class pretensions of even the
provincial groves of academe seemed to me to speak volumes about the
main barriers to opportunity in our education system, even after the
reforms of the sixties.
Amis's acclaimed debut novel left my Brockport students cold. They
found the humour as impenetrable as the culture, the characters as alien
as the common room rituals. That particular addition to my reading list
bombed. But not before, as I recall, its very inaccessibility for
home-bred Americans had triggered a productive debate about the role of
education in any society.
The move away from selection in schools and the expansion of tertiary
education in Britain was, after all, being paralleled at that time by an
even brasher enthusiasm in the American public school system for quota
places designed to give every school a pupil population whose profile
mirrored precisely the make-up of the wider community.
The objective, both here and there, was to open educational
opportunity up to those in the population who were manifestly failing to
achieve their full potential.
While there I visited schools where, if one left-handed male Hispanic
12-year-old left for another town, only a left-handed male Hispanic
12-year-old could be recruited or the school's pupil profile would have
been thrown, irretrievably, out of balance. If need be, appropriate
replacements would be bused in to preserve that equilibrium.
Such belief in social engineering appears quaintly naive today,
especially when news of Amis the Elder's death arrives on the same day
that Stephen Pollard, research director of the Fabian Society, is
calling on New Labour to drop its ''ideologically driven attachment to
mixed-ability schools'' and back voucher-based parental choice, school
specialisation, streaming, and selection.
Mr Pollard's employers apparently baulked at his policy shopping list.
He had to go to the Social Market Foundation, a rival think-tank closely
linked to Conservative Central Office, to get his pamphlet published.
But the mere fact that a leading Fabian, a self-confessed Blair
supporter, harbours such beliefs is an indication that the centre of
gravity in the education debate is fast swinging rightwards again.
Labour's official position remains that, as David Blunkett put it at
the weekend, ''standards can and must be raised for all our pupils and
not just a select few''. But the Labour leader's own family commitment
to an opted-out school for his son and the stringent budgetary pressures
facing any incoming Labour Government make it far from clear to me how
Blunkett's earlier Brighton promise that ''Labour will make every school
a good school'' can be realised this side of 2020, say.
The danger is not that Labour would bring back individual selection,
whether by examination or interview. Blunkett has explicitly ruled that
out. No, the danger is that, by flirting with opting out in the name of
parent power, Labour will help create the climate in which state schools
progressively divide into two categories -- the opted-out ones for
parents who bother to care and sinks for the rest.
As it happens, news of Amis's death and of Pollard's very unFabian
education views coincided with the sad news that John Pollock had died.
Tributes so far have concentrated on John's time as EIS general
secretary and his years on both the Labour Party's Scottish Council and
the Scottish Trades Union Congress.
But between 1965 and 1974 he was the impressive rector of Mainholm
Academy, one of the first of the new generation of comprehensive
secondary schools which followed the 1965 reforms.
As I recall from numerous working party discussions in which we both
participated, John was a passionate believer in a change which had one
overwhelming virtue. It ended, once and for all, a selective system
which crudely labelled the will-dos and the won't-dos at age 12.
As I reflected on John's death, I thought of another John, a friend
from my primary school in Greenock who failed his qualifying exam and
ended up in the local junior secondary. While I went on to university,
John eventually got into a shipyard drawing office.
Years later I met him again in Halifax in Nova Scotia where he was the
production director for the local shipyard. His son was at university.
There were countless thousands of unlucky Johns unfairly discriminated
against by the old selective system. That's one future I have no desire
to go back to.

THE British economy has slowed to a point where its growth, now
consistent for 14 quarters, is close to its long-term trend line. Since
the Chancellor (and the Governor of the Bank of England) obviously
feared that there was a danger of overheating and a swing back into
inflation, the latest data must reassure them. Some aspects are very
encouraging. Productivity gains in manufacturing, at 4.7%, are only a
smidgeon down on the previous quarterly figure, and wage rates are
hardly moving at all. These facts help to explain the way in which
exports are still performing well -- and certainly better than imports,
where the long-expected surge has not yet made itself evident, partly
because of the well-known hesitancy among retail spenders. Yet the
actual growth rate seems very modest and might go some way to justifying
the worries of Opposition spokesmen were it not for the fact that,
provided it can be maintained, the outcome is uncontestably real growth
and not any kind of inflationary mirage. Moreover it is accompanied by
steadily falling unemployment. Unemployment remains far too high (though
it is even worse in most of our EU partners), but it might go on moving
downwards, if much more slowly, if exports continue to hold up and
domestic demand grows a little faster. That last is possible if either
lower interest rates or modest fiscal reductions appear in next month's
Budget.
Either of these moves would have a beneficial effect on public
confidence which is generally, and correctly, identified as a key
inhibitor of any boost in consumer spending. It is quite possible that
only a change of Government will affect the spending pattern of the
public (since new administrations are always greeted with more of the
optimism which helps explain their election in the first place), but the
Chancellor cannot be expected to subscribe to that opinion which, from
his point of view, is defeatist. A good case for somewhat lower interest
rates is beginning to emerge -- a small reduction would be consistent
with a degree of prudence. Many commentators want to leave any cut until
the year end, or even early next year, because they are worried by the
way inflation has crept up, but there is always the chance that the
economy's slowdown will become more severe. Economic management is
always a balance of risks, but an element of risk-taking is not
incompatible with prudence, as Mr Clarke showed when he backed his own
judgment on interest rates last summer. Had he given way to Mr George
last May, these latest figures would probably have been depressing
rather than mildly reassuring.
Waiting on interest rates until the new year may make sure that
inflation is held off; but, even if Mr Clarke does that, nothing in the
latest data prohibits modest fiscal reductions. The Lib Dem view that
there is no scope at all for tax cuts is strange. There is scope, and
the real question is whether the revenues involved would not be better
spent enhancing public services, as we believe, rather than returned to
taxpayers in fatter pay packets. It is a straightforward political
choice, and it looks as if that choice will lie at the heart of the next
election, as it did at the last, though electors will be far more
sceptical of Tory tax cuts this time. In fact the real growth in
earnings, for all that it seems so slight, is delivering as much to most
taxpayers as the Chancellor could give them this time round. That fact
will not deter him if he wants to cut, but he might make a virtue of it
if prudence remains uppermost in his mind and no cuts appear.

<HEADLINE>Lottery attack. Mellor again off target</HEADLINE>

IT was a long time coming but now we have an indication of what the
National Lottery Charities Board intends to do with its pot of gold. The
outline was always there. The board had said from the start that it
wanted to help small local groups who were often unable to benefit from
fund-raising money in the same way as the larger charities. And within
that target was the broader primary aim of helping the most
disadvantaged in society and improving the quality of community life.
All of these are good, indeed noble, aims and an excellent way of
spending the lottery money already gathered. Helping the poor and
disadvantaged has the additional benefit of being socially acceptable.
In any enterprise of this sort there will be the winners, who receive
aid immediately, and those others who should not be regarded as losers,
for their turn might come at a later date.
Just as inevitably there will be the name-callers such as Mr David
Mellor, former Government Minister and a man who manages to do and say
the wrong thing with considerable efficiency. Specifically, his target
yesterday was the Strathclyde Poverty Alliance, an umbrella organisation
for more than 80 organisations and more than 500 community groups, all
involved in one manner or another in combating poverty. Mr Mellor did
not identify SPA by name but he was clearly unhappy that the largest
award, some #666,177, had been made to what he believes to be a
''politically correct'' vehicle. This comment requires some analysis for
it is clear that it represents an attitude which is prevalent among
sections of political opinion. Other small organisations in line for
money who have been attacked include a group which helps Eritrean
refugees, a Vietnamese mental health project in England, and those
counselling alcoholics in Strathclyde. All of these will also be
described as politically correct. What should we understand by this? In
its mean-spirited narrowness it implies that the recipients are unworthy
and only chosen because a small but powerful group of manipulators seek
to support them. Mr Mellor suggests that instead of the money going to
SPA it should have been given to the Royal National Institute for the
Blind. This is an excellent organisation which does much good; it will
be horrified to find itself the victim of Mellors's own political
correctness.
The truth is that organisations like SPA and the other small groups
struggling to help the disadvantaged are often politicised in the best
sense of the word. It means that they appreciate that one way of
achieving their ends is to acknowledge that benefits often arrive only
through the exercise of political energy and that they must behave
accordingly. This is not to say that they are necessarily politically
partisan (although many are) but that they believe in operating
politically. The traditional dispensers of political patronage do not
like this. Certainly, a little bit of lobbying over a good lunch is
perfectly acceptable, but those who stamp their feet, get red in the
face and angry over injustice and generally behave like nuisances are
beyond the pale. This is an unfortunate attitude. If SPA and the like
should be found to be wasting money, then they are ripe for criticism.
This charge is not made. They are, instead, aiming to encourage people
to develop practical skills to alleviate poverty in their own
communities and this is, after all, the specific aim of the charities
board. They should be congratulated for their persistence in adversity,
as should the National Lottery Charities Board Scotland for its swift
and efficient processing of applications.

SINCE to the making of books about cooking there is no end, it is past
time to marvel at a Glasgow kitchen companion that has not been off the
hob for most of the century.
Some ingredients of The Glasgow Cookery Book go back to Victoria. It
has become a staple item. It is constant as kale was. Some of us would
not eat without it. Yet it has seldom caused a stir. Contrast such
treatment with these recent days of celebrating the feast of St Delia.
As much excitement has greeted a new set of recipes by Delia Smith, a
television cook, as usually accompanies the appearance of a tome of
political memoirs or the off-field confessions of a football player. Her
enthusiasm for autumn fruit, it is said, has emptied shops of
cranberries. She has been acclaimed as the most influential hand in the
history of cooking.
Success of her latest book has been variously accounted. Talk is of
sales of 500,000. Either they went in the first week of publication or
are expected to do so before the end of the year. One way or another it
is a lot of cumin.
Delia Smith has become like an estate of the realm. But fame has had
its price. Bay leaves of envy have been added to her work. She has been
accused of being humourless. Some reviewers have wondered whether she is
a live person. Flaws have been spotted even in her complexion.
The lesson appears to be that if you can't stand the heat in the
kitchen, don't write a cookery book.
For its part The Glasgow Cookery Book has silent friends. We are
one-book cooks. No need is felt for any other of the 700-odd volumes
which ballast bookshop shelves. Perhaps, we are its slaves. But we have
been mute devotees.
Now is a time to declare the enchantment for two well-mixed reasons.
For a starter is vulgar success. As a bestseller the Glasgow book is
up with Delia. It has found homes for around 400,000 copies in its own
sweet time.
Last month the masterpiece entered its twenty-first year. For so long
have its secrets been exchanged from abernethy biscuits to zingara
cutlets. It has stood like a sentinel at the door of the national
treasure house that holds the likes of Helensburgh toffee and fig
tablet. In it Scotland's story is put on a plate.
Now going the book's way is some scholarly research. Its pages will
have their place in a chronicle of Glasgow Caledonian University. For
the university's pre-history includes the creators and only begetters of
the Glasgow book.
It had several Eves. Pre-eminent among them was Miss Ella Glaister, a
daughter of a medical family dynasty, who was the first principal of the
Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science.
For understandable reasons, its name had some shortening. It was
called the Dough School. In turn it became Queen's College before being
stirred into the academic casserole of Caledonian University.
Miss Glaister's idea was that a textbook for her students could be
shared by housewives, while college teachers kept the recipes up to
date. That was in l9l0. Then there came a time (in l975) to rebake the
entire work. Its mixtures went metric. Newish food fads like spaghetti
found more space. But it remained a plain guide to good nosh and without
any gaudy food photographs.
Stubborn diehards (meaning me) continue to prefer the first edition.
They stick to the ounces and pints of what came to be called the Purple
Book from the cranberry hue of its cover.
In time the proud purple mellows to a shy blue. Essentially, however,
the contents remain constant. All eight stages to make haggis, for
instance, have been preserved. They remain a two-day job.
Intrepidly, the Purple Book puts into print deep mysteries that
ordinary manuals skip, even about how to boil an egg.
Never did the Dough School authors hesitate to take off into the
fancier flights of cuisine. They savoured the language of
sophistication. Expressions like a la maitre d'hotel were no problem to
them. Bain-marie tripped off their tongues. Words like chiffonade were a
bagatelle.
But a publication that engraves eternally how to boil eggs has
serenest confidence. No kitchen secret is so arcane. Success seems often
to depend on imponderables like the cook's condition of self-confidence
and, possibly, the morning's weather. Sometimes it feels as if the
positions of the planets may be involved.
Yet the Purple Book with no flush of vainglory dishes out alternative
sets of pellucid instruction, each a spare poem in two stanzas. For
hard-boiled it lyricises:
l. Put egg in cold water; bring to boil, boil slowly l0 minutes.
2. Cool in cold water to prevent yolk discolouring.
For complete perfection comes an added line in small type as if meant
to be an intimate whisper in the ear: ''To help keep yolk in centre of
egg, stir water for a few moments after adding egg.''
Some pages of the Purple Book are best turned with the eyes shut. For
example, it gives house room to rules for skinning rabbits, which seem
to have become fashionable food again. Even on my boldest days I never
get beyond the third rule which goes along the lines of: ''Push hind
legs upwards through the skin.''
But blessing by stirring the water that eggs are boiled in -- that's
witchcraft.

Theatre
THE theatre has been transformed by local company PACE into,
alternately, a football ground and a cinema, with atmospheric film
footage projected on the back wall reinforcing the sense of time for the
two settings -- 1959 and 1987, the years St Mirren lifted the Scottish
Cup. Designer Donald McLean's football ground sites the main action on
the pitch, framed by a scarf-waving, frenzied chorus and two terraces
and one stand of audience.
David Wallace's play celebrates St Mirren by eschewing historical
detail to focus on the fans' sense of identity and belonging. That the
production does so, overwhelmingly, owes more to the exuberance of the
30-plus young chorus, whose enthusiasm for the football chants often
verges on the deafening, than any excitement generated by the narrative.
The plot is so weak it should have been stretchered off. Each act --
yep, it's another ''play of two halves'' -- concentrates on the
relationship between a trio of brothers and their friend, one lot living
in the fifties and twisting to Bill Haley and the other lot living in
the eighties and not really doing anything to The Proclaimers. That the
second act almost exactly mirrors the dynamics of the first, with simple
updated parallels seemed pointless.
However, despite a dependency on groan-inducing puns and the over-used
device of the chorus commenting in exaggerated asides on the onstage
action, it's all upbeat, if noisy fun. Buy a ticket but --
strong-language alert -- take a couple of aspirin instead of the kids.

EVIDENTLY Mr Thomas H Logan has never been abroad (apart from the
special holiday resorts where English is spoken and Taste of Scotland
food is served) to meet people from the Scandinavian countries (October
18).
These people are simply out there in the world, including countries
outside our vision of wealthy English-speaking countries, to represent
their countries and contribute to its economical balance of export and
import.
These Scandinavians abroad are communicating with the people in the
country of posting in educated English, and not in the various dialects
of English, hence they are understood.
And how many Scandinavians are in top executive positions in the UK?
Think of Kvaerner Govan shipyards, Ove Arup consulting engineers,
Rock-wool, Salvesen, etc.
Mr Logan should check with the embassies of the Scandinavian countries
how many firms are established abroad and how many Scandinavian
nationals are working outwith their own countries.

I WRITE on behalf of my brother, Sir John Usher, Bt, who is
co-executor of the late Sir Robert Usher with Mrs J Wolfe-Murray, and
whom I represent in Scotland with full legal powers as he is living
abroad at present.
Both he, myself, and other relatives of our family disassociate
ourselves completely from the misstatements and the generally false
impression which The Herald's article of Monday, October 16, projects of
our branch of the Usher family. Your informant, Mrs J Wolfe-Murray,
chose to portray herself as the only executor to your reporter.
The article states that Hallrule House is to be sold to pay death
duties ''with the death of the two present heirs''. Heirs succeed to
ownership of property and death duties are not, and never have been,
payable on the death of an heir or heirs. In our case death duties are
payable on the death of the beneficial owner of the Wells Estate, the
late Sir Robert Usher.
Hallrule House was in fact sold in August of this year and the cause
of its sale had nothing whatever to do with the payment of death duties.
Hallrule House and the whole of Wells Estate, in which Hallrule House is
located, had to be sold because of the intestacy of Sir Robert.
He was an incapax (not able to look after his own affairs) and had a
curator-bonis looking after his affairs for many years until his death
last year.
Being an incapax he was not capable of making a will, hence the
intestacy. In this eventuality the legal requirement was that everything
which he owned, ie, the Wells Estate, had to be sold and the proceeds
divided up among his beneficiaries. This is the only reason for the sale
of all his property.
Wells House, which historically gave its name to the Wells Estate, and
Norton House, near Edinburgh, were the main seats of our family until
the 1950s when the former was dynamited and the latter was sold and
became a hotel. Only then did Hallrule take a more prominent part when
it was occupied by Sir Stuart Leslie and family.
My brother, myself, and other relations would have preferred no
publicity at all on this matter of the intestacy and resultant sale
which is bad enough for our family on its own.
Stuart Usher,
Wells, Hawick.

THE current controversy about ruddy ducks and white-headed ducks has
less to do with ducks than with the egos of would-be ecological
manipulators disguised as conservationists.
By their own admission such people caused the problem in the first
place when Sir Peter Scott's Wildlife and Wetland Trust imported ruddy
ducks then allowed some to escape at Slimbridge 40 years ago.
There are now populations of these ducks from Israel to Iceland, from
Finland to Morocco, thriving and flourishing, except in Spain where they
are shot on sight for daring to mate with local white-heads.
Having caused the problem the same group of conservationists are now
demanding an international massacre of ruddies (including in the UK) at
the behest of the regional government of Andalusia, and it looks as if
the Department of the Environment is so craven that it appears to be
about to go to the fantastic lengths of amending the Wildlife and
Countryside Act, 1981, to permit this proposed genocide.
If this is allowed to go ahead, it will be a pointless slaughter as
its chances of success are obviously zero. But ecological manipulators
seldom admit defeat, they merely demand ever more preposterous and
futile interventions.
The white-headed duck is not a British bird or a British problem. Let
the Spanish keep their Spanish practices in Spain.

SO the conservation movement is not divided over the need to control
ruddy ducks in the UK, according to David Minns (October 11). While the
upper echelons of the RSPB and other organisations may be in agreement,
if they cared to consult their own staff they would certainly find a
different viewpoint.
There may be ''wide understanding'' of the society's policy, but I
find that a considerable majority of members and staff are either
opposed to the killing, or have strong reservations. If the RSPB don't
believe this, I suggest they ballot their membership and staff to
clarify the situation.
I must correct two misconceptions by David Minns. First, I did not
suggest that hybridisation between ruddy and white-headed ducks should
be allowed to continue so that a super-species would develop; I said
that it would be better than resorting to such severe control measures.
Also, I did not state that cross-breeding would result in a
super-species. Surely David Minns understands that a super-species is a
complex of closely-related species, not some improved product of
deliberate or involuntary genetic engineering.
My suggestion was that ruddy and white-headed ducks already constitute
a super-species complex.
Figures produced by the ruddy-duck working group suggest that fewer
than 50 individuals from the UK emigrate to continental Europe each
year. The white-headed ducks are restricted to certain localities in
Spain.
Surely it would be more effective to exert control there by shooting
the few ruddy ducks which arrive on the breeding grounds of the
white-headed duck rather than shoot hundreds annually in Britain?
The only other alternative, outright extermination of ruddy ducks
throughout Europe, is impractical. If attempted, a huge amount of effort
and expense would be wasted (over #150,000 so far), which could be
directed towards more worthwhile causes.
A lot of cruelty would be inflicted, and the public perception of
conservation severely damaged. The RSPB, in supporting the shooting of
ruddy ducks, are shooting themselves in the collective foot.

IT was predictable that the SNP and the Conservatives, having stood
aside from the Constitutional Convention's work, would criticise the
result.
It is interesting to see that their criticisms predict the same
outcome: that since, they say, this will not work, it will lead
inevitably to a demand for a greater control of our own affairs and even
to independence.
Every democratic Scot will be happy to see SNP MSPs arguing their case
for this in the Scottish parliament, the appropriate forum.
But why, some might wonder, are the Conservatives not predicting that
we will all be crawling to Westminster, pleading for a return to the
status quo?
Could it be that in their hearts they know, ''It's democracy,
stupid'', and that given even half a democratic chance Scots can make a
better Scotland?
Given our own elected parliament we can get started. We trust they'll
join us in that endeavour.

BEFORE touring Ireland I ordered 100 punts from the bank, the cost
being #109.66 made up of #105.60 for the notes, #3.00 handling fee and
#1.06 commission.
I find it hard to understand how they can justify both a handling fee
and commission. I thought these words were synonymous.
When withdrawing cash from a building society I asked for Bank of
England notes but they were able to give me only one or two; at the
Clydesdale Bank I tried to exchange Scottish banknotes for English. The
teller began to sort through bundles of notes to find the odd English
one and then said, ''Sorry. That's all I can find -- you should have
given us a few days' warning''. It was just the same in the Bank of
Scotland.
The meal during the very comfortable ferry crossing from Stranraer to
Larne brought the first of the Ulster banknotes into the wallet -- no
real problem so long as we had none left by the time we got off the
ferry at Stranraer on the way home.
Our plan was to turn right at Larne and go round the coast back to
Larne. It was a great success but one downside was having to maintain
two purses, one with Irish money and one with British.
In the South I discovered that my cash card used in appropriate
automatic teller machines produced punts and later my bank statement
showed that 100 punts cost about #103.45. Next time I will not take any
punts with me.
In a small cafe in Co Wexford when the lady said, ''You're Scottish,''
I thought that once again my accent was the best form of passport. But
she continued, ''Would you please accept this Scottish fiver in your
change? It will save me a lot of trouble at the bank''.
I accepted it and wholeheartedly agreed with her comment that it was
high time we had just one currency. I don't think she was talking about
the EU -- just the UK and Ireland -- but I can see nothing but benefits
in a single European currency, and the sooner the better.

CAMPBELL CHRISTIE may well have been manipulated by Michael Forsyth,

These are sensitive times for Ireland and for the peace process. I
don't for a moment believe that your Scottish political correspondent is
deliberately being racist, but I also don't believe that a fair and
sensitive political solution can emerge for Ireland whilst unthinking

IF ever I was proud to be a Scotsman it was this morning (October 12)
when John Macleod's article, On course for new paganism (August 26),
arrived on my desk.
If ever I was proud to be a Glaswegian it was when I saw The Herald's
courage to print such an article when many of its readers are Roman
Catholics. Much more than all this, never have I been so proud to be a
Christian.
Down here in Latin America the drug trafficking together with the evil
and corruption dominated by Roman Catholics and on a scale almost
unbelievable is completely ignored by the Pope just in the same way in
which he turned a blind eye to the Northern Ireland situation.
And yet, this is quite understandable because the poor human fellow
has never enjoyed the forgiveness of sins through the death of the Lord
Jesus Christ (1 John 1:7) or ever known the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit in his life.
Almost every day is a nightmare out here with reports of increased
violence and drug trafficking, the most recent of these being the
capture of over four tons of cocaine leaving the country in one
consignment, an estimated value of $100 million, and a story that would
make Hollywood's greatest adventure pale into insignificance.
This and many other crimes in this Roman Catholic country should
awaken our country to the forces of evil quickly devouring a great
nation. No longer Bible-loving Scotland, no longer a people with a
thirst for God's Word, just a slow death of heartache and sorrow.
It is not all gloom and doom down here. The glorious gospel of Jesus
Christ is liberating the lives of thousands not only from the deadly
drugs but from sin with its eternal consequences.
Churches are full, Christians are witnessing, and the great displays
of texts proclaiming that Jesus Christ has the power to change your life
is not on flimsy poster paper but painted with quality weatherproof
paint. The message is so vital!

THE death of James Murray, buried last Thursday amid great mourning,
has revived the controversy over boxing. As ever, we were reminded of
three things. First, the essential decency of most active in the sport;
one may think only of Alex Morrison, Murray's Skye-born manager, whose
devastation was evident, who may now quit boxing entirely.
This contrasts with the ghastly character of many who enjoy watching
big fights; the bitches in fur coats, the yelling yobboes in black tie,
the rioting mob at the Hospitality Inn whose yobbery, in hampering
medical assistance, might well have cost Murray's life. And then, of
course, there are the ban-it-now brigade, who want parliamentary action
at once, and think boxing exploitative and disgusting and call for it to
be made illegal.
I have never boxed in my life, and I do not enjoy watching it, but I
cannot agree.
Boxing has a serious image problem. Over the past decade it has cost
several lives and left dozens of crippled casualties. Muhammad Ali, who
played a year or three too long and took one punch too many, is now a
shambling wreck of a man, crippled with boxing-related Parkinson's
Disease, able to sign autographs only in slow baby print. Mike Watson,
who nearly died in September 1991, will never leave his wheelchair.
There's the tacky connections of boxing, with low-life and the Mob,
protection rackets and bouncers less than particular about thieir
targets. The Kray twins were active in boxing business. In Glasgow many
well known to the police are linked to the sport. There's the
degradation of young nobody boxers, bashing their way to the top through
seedy halls and cut eyebrows.
Even worse, perhaps, is the state to which the ageing has been
reduced. Joe Bugner is already talking of another comeback. Ken
Buchanan, a world champion two decades ago, retired to lose a fortune in
a mismanaged hotel. A few years ago he was doing cheap fights for 25
quid a go.
None of this helps. But it rather masks the reality that, in truth,
boxing is a pretty safe sport, well down the ranks of leisure activity
for death and injury. Statistically, in terms of overall damage,
football is the most dangerous sport in Britain, with more injuries
inflicted than anything else. In terms of lethal injury, rugby --
usually by broken necks -- kills more folk every year than boxing
manages in five.
Those in the boxing industry are under huge pressure to regulate the
sport and guard against the lobby who want it banned. Even in the past
decade there have been big improvements. There is tighter medical
supervision. Referees are instructed to stop fights at the earliest sign
of trouble. Fights are shorter than they were.
Are there not two difficulties here? For one, boxing is irredeemably
cast as a working-class sport, something for the vulgar throng. Very few
sophisticates, very few of us in the circles of chattering liberalism
admit to watching it, far less enjoying it. Like smoking, something
despised by the privileged is now under threat from their political
clout.
And, for another -- this is the standard riposte of, say, the British
Medical Association when we try to judge the relative safety of boxing
against other sports -- boxers climb into the ring to hurt somebody. All
contact sports carry an element of risk. Rugby and football, played on
such a massive scale as they are, inevitably inflict thousands of
injuries in Britain each year. But the sportsman does all he can to
minimise bodily damage to himself or others.
In boxing, though -- so its opponents argue -- we have something
little more than legalised assault. A guy -- invariably of poor
background, and in England often black -- takes to the canvas to batter
and punch and beat and bruise an opponent to subjection, until he is
reduced to a jellied heap of pain, ''spitting teeth and bits of gum into
a bloodstained ring that was one man's hell and Kevin's glory'', as
Monty Python memorably put it.
This is the public perception. It is not, however, entirely fair.
Boxing is supposed to be about self-defence. The real skill is in
dodging blows, not inflicting them. The trouble with modern boxing is
that it has been increasingly perverted, in practice, to something much
more destructive and aggressive. Standards of build, fitness, ferocity
and stamina have improved here as they have improved in every other
British sport -- better general health and nutrition, better science,
bigger money, the power of television; all have improved your average
boxer, and honed those at the top to human mincing-machines.
It is said that a legal ban would work; that even if boxing continued
underground, it would be a marginalised, stigmatised minority activity,
like cockfighting and badger-baiting. I disagree. In our perverse
culture organised cruelty to animals is deplored; dog-fighting rings,
and the like, can scarcely exist in modern Britain. I doubt if such
impassioned concern would attend illicit fighting (and, in any event, we
have illegal underground boxing already).
The fact remains that there are thousands of men who box. For most, it
is the only thing in life that grants them dignity; for many, it is the
only way they can earn a living. They know the risks and, being
sensible, minimise them as best they can. As James Murray's father
simply put it, in his ocean of grief; better to lose a lad this way than
to find him dead in a close with a needle up his arm.
Who can seriously believe that our thousands of boxers would
obediently hang up their gloves? And, driven underground, without
medical back-up, without the supervision of respectable and accountable
bodies, will there not be much more maiming, blood-clots, and death? The
morality of boxing is one issue. The law regarding it is another. A
legal prohibition of boxing cannot be enforced and should not be sought.
On the other hand, a good deal more should be done to make it safer.
Rounds should be fewer. Rounds should be shorter. MRI scans should be
mandatory before big fights.
One thing I would not seek, however, is a requirement for helmets.
American football is a good example of sport being denatured,
body-to-body contact being minimised by armour; paradoxically, this
makes it far more dangerous. It is very difficult to hurt someone with
your own bare body without hurting yourself.
In real life, socking someone hard on the jaw will break your hand. In
boxing, at present, opponents wear massive gloves, reducing hand injury
at the cost of allowing them to inflict blows with far greater force. A
parting uppercut: would the sport not be much safer if we returned to
bare-fisted fights?

IF my memory is correct, when the Erskine Bridge opened the toll was
two shillings for a car which compared with the ferry charges of 1s 6d
previously. Those of us in this area were delighted to pay for the extra
convenience.
The toll at Erskine is now six times greater, and until the Skye
Bridge opened was the dearest toll bridge in Scotland. What will the
Skye Bridge toll rise to?

Allan Laing delves into the fertile and devious imagination of Minette
Walters, who is being hailed as the mystery writer to watch
THERE is a certain irony in the fact that Minette Walters lives in
Romsey, a quiet little town midway between Winchester and Southampton.
For that is where they film the Inspector Wexford Mysteries. It is worth
pointing out, however, that she was there first. Long before the
invasion of the television cameras.
The curious thing is that Walters is the one English mystery writer
who is currently giving Wexford's creator, Ruth Rendell, a fair old run
for her money. She is the Next Big Thing in crime fiction. The one to
watch. The one to read.
It probably escaped your attention, but Walters did make a brief
appearance in one Wexford episode. Well, not exactly her. But something
which belonged to her. ''It was my tennis skirt,'' she explains. ''My
neighbour's daughter was an extra in one of the programmes and she
needed to wear a tennis skirt. So I let her borrow mine.''
The first thing that strikes you about Walters is her vivacious
personality. With a beaming smile, a warm glow, and (it has to be said)
a plummy Home Counties accent, she engages you completely on entering a
room.
The room belongs to her publishers, Macmillan, and it is where their
board meet. It is, to be honest, sparse and uncomfortable. The central
heating pipes above your head don't help.
Walters in person belies the very image of her literary work -- which
is dark, mysterious, and oft times uncomfortable. During the past few
years she has written a series of riveting crime novels, each one better
than the one before. Her latest, The Dark Room, is arguably her best. It
is the one surely destined to place her at the forefront of her craft.
Jinx, a self-contained, young, professional woman, wakes up in a
hospital bed with no knowledge of the past two weeks. The victim of a
dreadful road accident (possibly the result of a suicide attempt), the
trauma has led to the loss of her short-term memory. Two people of her
close acquaintance -- the man she was due to marry and the woman who
stole him from her -- have been brutally murdered. Jinx is an obvious
suspect. And perhaps she did it. Who knows? Well, not her -- for she
cannot remember.
It is an intriguing and finely-written psychological mystery. An
intricate literary puzzle. It is the product of a fertile imagination
and a devilishly devious mind. Walters joins a long line of respectable,
middle-class English women (stretching from Agatha Christie and Dorothy
L. Sayers, through Ruth Rendell and P D James, to Frances Fyfield and
Paula Gosling) who have made fictional murder their stock in trade.
''I suppose it's because women are deeply analytical,'' she says. ''We
sit at home with our children and there is nothing to do and no-one to
talk to. And that is where we develop our deviousness.''
Walters, with a background in magazine journalism and romantic fiction
writing, gave up the pen game in order to rear her two (now teenage)
boys. When she chose to return to writing, she focused on crime. She had
always been fascinated by the subject and recalls, as a child, reading
voraciously every word of every report of the notorious Hanratty A6
murder case in the Daily Telegraph.
''My stories all come from the imagination -- and that's slightly
worrying, to be honest. Crime does fascinate me but it's the why rather
than the who. I mean, why does anyone see murder as a solution to a
problem when most of us see it as the start of a whole series of other
problems?'' she asks.
Her first novel, The Ice House, was inspired by those American
buddy-buddy movies (where two stand-up guys support each other through
some kind of adventure). Walters turned it on its head and made it
women. But not just two women. She made it three.
''Faced with a murder accusation, would they support each other or
destroy each other? How would these women, who were isolated, react to
having the full impact of a police investigation into their lives?'' she
asks.
Though Walters' four novels are profoundly different in approach,
style, and content, there is a common thread running through them. And,
in simplistic terms, it is this: you cannot judge a book by its cover.
There is always a mystery to her characters who are never as they seem.
What you see is seldom what you get.
She is intrigued by society's apparent need to label individuals. ''We
never bother to delve very deeply into the people we meet but if we did
we'd find these extraordinary layers of personality which either
attracts you more or turns you off,'' she says.
Walters' second novel, The Sculptress, which is currently being
adapted for a BBC television series starring Pauline Quirke, concerns
itself with physical attraction. Its central character is Olive, a
horrendously unattractive and obese woman (and apparently psychotic),
who is serving time for a senseless and particularly violent murder.
Only one person, a beautiful female journalist, has any faith in Olive.
''What you wear and how you look is not what is important,'' explains
Walters. ''It is your personality which should count. But with The
Sculptress I decided to take this supremely unattractive person with
this tremendous crime in her background. So how could anyone relate to
this frightening person? But then Olive does manage to reach this one
person who is prepared to listen to her. And you have the building up of
this peculiar relationship between two women who, under normal
circumstances, would have no attraction to each other whatsoever.''
The novel also concerns itself with the question of truth. Is it
possible to know, without a shadow of a doubt, when someone is telling
the truth? Walters thinks not. ''When I look at my two sons, for
instance, I think I know when they're telling the truth, but I couldn't
stand up in a court of law and swear to it.''
And so to The Dark Room, Walters longest and most ambitious novel to
date. The principal character, Jinx, is a very self-contained young
woman. This was important for the author because, as the story unfolds,
Jinx has to rely more and more upon her personal strengths. And, again,
the question of truth appears.
''What interested me here was how well we know ourselves. We may not
be able to tell when other people are lying but we're pretty damned sure
we know when we are telling the truth.
''But suppose you wipe away two weeks from your memory and you have
then to rely totally upon the person you remember yourself to be. Though
you don't recall that two-week period you have to interpret what you
might have done through your own perception of yourself.
''It is a challenge to the reader. Do you want to believe her or do
you want to believe the evidence that is accumulating against her. It's
like, we all think we know ourselves, but then we get this horrible
shock when we hear ourselves on a tape recorder or see ourselves on a
video. It's dreadful when you see yourself from an objective
perspective,'' she says.
An American reviewer wrote to Walters recently and said that what he
found most interesting about her books was the fact that the characters
you initially hate are the ones you end up liking; and the ones you like
at first -- the ones who represent goodness or a better side to life --
you end up hating.
The author was delighted with the observation because that is exactly
what she sets out to do -- to overturn the stereotypes.
''I have a fundamental belief that the crime story is the only true
story-telling genre. What I do is set the reader a puzzle. It's a
guessing game. One of the important things which maybe gets forgotten at
times is the fact that you need suspects in a crime story. That is how
you encourage the reader to become involved in the puzzle element.
''If I was writing a thriller then the puzzle might not be so
important but, in terms of a crime story, the reader has to see if he or
she can work it out before the end,'' she adds.
P D James recently drew attention to the great intellectual divide
between middle-class and working-class crime writing. With some
ill-chosen remarks she attacked the growing trend among English mystery
authors to write in a hard-boiled, lowlife, style. On the surface at
least, the work of Walters would appear to follow in the tradition of P
D James. Does she agree?
''Of course, I'm immensely flattered to be compared to her but I am
being slightly irritated at the moment of being stuffed into a bracket
because I don't think I am in one. While it's true that my books are set
in the Home Counties and they involve the people who live there, my work
is far removed from traditional English crime writing. Agatha Christie
would turn in her grave if she thought my type of writing was allied to
hers.
''I put my murders into the first few pages because they are
particularly unpleasant. They are not gentle murders. There is a debate
there -- and it is about where crime fiction is going. But we should not
categorise authors. Give them convenient labels. Britain has never had a
tradition of hard-boiled writing but suddenly everyone is doing it and I
find that sad because I'd like people to continue to be original.
''I suppose I am different in that I have refused to follow a series
character. I'd be bored solid if I wrote books featuring the same
detective. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to get stuck in to
some kind of formula which I'd have to pursue.''
* The Dark Room by Minette Walters is published by Macmillan, #15.99.

THE driving force behind Scotland's Charities Board is 42-year-old
Glaswegian John Rafferty, who joined the board four months ago and,
according to insiders, ''hit the ground running''.
When the number of applications for lottery cash caused the UK network
computer operation to crash, Mr Rafferty and his eight HQ staff in
Edinburgh's Norloch House ''went manual'', sifting through huge piles of
applications.
By the beginning of September, the Scottish team were ahead of
counterparts elsewhere in Britain.
One assessor told The Herald: ''Rafferty is a man who is for
efficiency but against bureaucracy.''
Mr Rafferty, brought up in Pollok, is a product of Stirling and
Glasgow universities. Away from his work, he relaxes by playing the

prison source said one-legged Sams, jailed two years ago for the murder
of Leeds teenager Julie Dart and the kidnap of estate agent Stephanie
Slater, had been the inmate involved.
At his home in Wakefield, Mrs Flack's husband John, the Archdeacon of
Pontefract, said his wife was in a ''state of shock''.
There were reports that Sams, 53, had tried to strangle Mrs Flack with
her key chain, but he was dragged off by prison staff after she hit the
panic button. She was injured but did not need hospital treatment.
A police spokesman said: ''There was an assault on a probation officer
by an inmate at Wakefield Prison.''
The attack will come as another embarrassment for the Prison Service,
still reeling from a highly-critical report into the Parkhurst Prison
breakout and the subsequent sacking of the service's director general,
Mr Derek Lewis.
Sams was found guilty in 1993 of the murder and kidnapping of Miss
Dart in 1991 and the kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of Miss
Slater. Miss Dart's body was found dumped in a field.
In January 1992, he kidnapped Miss Stephanie Slater, after luring her
to a house by pretending to be a possible buyer. Miss Slater, from
Birmingham, was kept in a coffin-like box for eight days.

A PUB with no beer -- aimed at under-age youngsters -- is a sparkling
success in Falkirk. The scheme, in the lounge bar of the Magpie, Maggie
Woods Loan, which attracts around 35 under-16s twice a week, has been
extended by Falkirk District Council for six more months. Police said
trouble in the area had slumped since it started.

STRATHCLYDE Poverty Alliance sees its #666,177 award as a step in its
long-term strategy of helping people to help themselves but as no
''quick fix'' to ending poverty.
The cash will help set up a mobile poverty action resource team, which
has been planned in talks with representatives of more than 150
community groups.
The alliance said the project would enable it to equip communities
with the information, training, skills, and experience they need to
start partnerships and practical programmes to lift their communities
out of poverty.
Mr Damian Killeen, director of the alliance, said: ''We hope that the
Charities Board will maintain this commitment by increasing the funds
available for tackling poverty and by announcing that reducing poverty
will continue to be the board's main funding priority for the
foreseeable future.''
The mobile resource team will have a staff of seven and is expected to
go into action towards the end of this year.
Mr Killeen said it was intended to base the team outside Glasgow so
that it could work with organisations both in the city and more distant
rural parts of the West of Scotland.
''The idea is to help these people to develop their capacities so that
the vision they have can lead to change rather than the vision coming
from outside authorities,'' he said.
Strathclyde Poverty Alliance is a registered charity which brings
together workers and activists from community groups, voluntary
organisations, and public and private-sector agencies to combat poverty.
Founded 10 years ago, it was an informal network for four years before
it received financial support from Strathclyde Regional Council to
employ staff. It operates from premises in Buchanan Street, Glasgow,
with 16 members of staff.

THE Yorkhill Family House Ltd, which is building a ''home away from
home'' for families of seriously ill children being treated at Glasgow's
Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, has received the second
biggest pay-out.
The contribution of #635,000 to the Ronald McDonald House, which is
under construction beside the hospital, means that the charity will be
able to complete the project without bridging loans.
The accommodation for 24 families at a time will be called Ronald
McDonald House. Similar houses, also named after the popular children's
character, already exist in London and Liverpool. Scotland's first is
due to open early next year.
Mr John Slater, the charity's director, admitted that like many
charities, the Yorkhill Family House had been finding fund-raising
''very difficult'' recently.
''There is going to be a Government investigation into the effect of
the lottery on charities. I can't say how much effect it has had, but it
must be there because people are putting their pennies into scratch
cards and lottery tickets so there is less to spend on other
charities,'' he said.
Asked to comment on the growing controversy over which charities have
been allocated grants by the board, Mr Slater said: ''We were inspected
very, very thoroughly. We had a series of interviews, almost a grilling.
They were very thorough in the work they did to look at this project. If
they did this with all the applicants they must have had a very
difficult job.''
The Ronald McDonald House at Yorkhill is intended to be a ''home away
from home'' for families of children suffering from serious illness or
complex paediatric conditions. Families will stay there at no cost while
their child is being treated in hospital.

THE meeting of Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin last night produced
dramatic results on Bosnia and nuclear tests.
President Clinton said after the summit he and the Russian President
had reached ''complete agreement'' on working together for peace in
Bosnia.
They had also agreed to push for ratification of the Start II nuclear
treaty and would jointly seek a total ban on nuclear weapons tests next
year. ''This is a major, major step and it dramatically increases the
chances of our success for a sweeping, comprehensive test ban treaty,''
Mr Clinton said.
''We spent the vast majority of our time discussing Bosnia and we
reached complete agreement about how we would work together for peace
there,'' Mr Clinton told a joint news conference. ''We have reached
agreement on the importance of the involvement of Russia and the other
contact group partners in the peace process.''
It had been the main sticking point in the peace process. Mr Yeltsin
had told the UN in his address that Russia insisted its contribution to
the Bosnia peace force should be under UN command, not Nato's.
However, yesterday Mr Yeltsin said: ''We agreed today that Russian
armed forces will participate in these operations. But how they go about
doing it is the affair of the military. It is not a question for us two
presidents. We have done our task.''
The American military is already prepared. More than 10,000 US troops
are set for a possible mission to Bosnia. Defence Secretary William
Perry has promised they would be ''the biggest, toughest and meanest dog
in town''.
Officials at the US army's German training base near Grafenwoehr said
any troops sent to the area would also have bite after the bitter lesson
the US learned in Somalia. The expected deployment of US troops to
Bosnia is likely to be the most fortified peacekeeping mission in
American history with troops backed by a fleet of armoured vehicles and
M-1 tanks, Army officials said.
''We're not going to go into Bosnia with just light infantry troops.
We learned our mistake about that in Somalia,'' said Colonel William
Blankmeyer, who commands a tank batallion now training as part of
Operation Mountain Shield.
Mr Clinton, appearing with Mr Yeltsin after their talks at the New
York riverside home of former President Franklin Roosevelt, said the two
countries defence ministers would meet to work out the details of the
Bosnia co-operation.
After their four hours of talks, Mr Yeltsin said he was leaving with
''a degree of optimism'' he had not had when he arrived.
The expansion of Nato and Russia's sale of nuclear power plants to
Iran were also on the agenda.
However, there were no clear-cut announcements on these issues. There
is an election under way in Russia, and politicians' statements, in
Moscow as elsewhere, are much influenced by such events. Mr Yeltsin's
opponents are beating the nationalist drum, so he is bound to tap on it
himself.
The Americans can forgive that, and will do their best to help their
old ally by taking his concerns seriously. However, that does not mean
that they will give away anything of substance.
As for the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran, the Russians are
obdurate. They need the money, and profess to believe the Iranians when
they insist that they have no ulterior motives. The Americans do not
trust Tehran, remembering the use to which Saddam Hussein put his own
research reactors in starting to build Iraq's nuclear arsenal.
However, the main nuclear issue at the meeting, the move for a total
ban on nuclear weapons tests, was a bonus, and further isolates France.
Murray Ritchie, European Editor, writes from Strasbourg: A major
constitutional crisis loomed in Europe last night as the European
Commission met in strict secrecy in Brussels to consider taking France
to court for its nuclear testing programme in the South Pacific.
As Commissioners worked to reach a final decision after a month of
sometimes bitter dispute, the European Parliament in Strasbourg was
threatening legal action of its own in the event of the French action
being approved.
Commissioners were said to be fairly evenly split on whether the
continuing French tests were in breach of the Euratom treaty. They were
meeting for the fourth time on the issue last night after giving France
a deadline to reply to repeated requests for technical information.
Two weeks ago they were said to have left ''blood on the walls'' after
a fierce dispute about the legality of President Jacques Chirac's
decision to resume testing in defiance of world opinion.
Commission President Jacques Santer will fly to Strasbourg this
morning to report personally to the European Parliament which has
already condemned the tests. He ordered an absolute ban on information
being given about last night's meeting ahead of his briefing of Euro-MPs
this morning.
Last night the parliament's strongest voting bloc, the 217-strong
socialists, were considering suing the Commission for failing in its
duty if it failed to sue the French. And if the French are taken to
court by the Commission the resulting tension could paralyse the EU as
it heads for the crucial Madrid summit in December, where issues such as
the single currency will be high on the agenda.

SIR Marcus Fox is to face a challenge for the second year running for

was confirmed last night.
Right-wing former Education Minister Bob Dunn threw his hat into the
ring with the announcement that he is to be a candidate in next month's
poll of back benchers.
Sir Marcus, 68, an arch-John Major loyalist, last year narrowly staved
off a challenge by Sir Nicholas Bonsor and Tory MPs are warning that he
again faces a serious contest. Unlike last year's challenge, which was
heavily fuelled by discontent with Mr Major's leadership, this year's
election will be far more about Sir Marcus's own performance.

Late Edition is under fire, but Allan Laing explains why Scottish
Television can be excused for producing a few turkeys
IT is a truth, universally acknowledged, that Scottish Television
wouldn't tackle a drama series like Pride and Prejudice if its very life
depended upon it. There are three reasons for this. The first is
certainly a good one. STV is Scottish and it wouldn't touch an
adaptation of a quintessentially English novel with a barge pole. Fair
enough.
The second reason is equally understandable. A series such as Pride
and Prejudice costs an arm and a leg to make -- and STV are not in the
business of spending limbs on programmes.
The third reason is a little more iffy. Period drama, popular though
it is, is generally perceived to be highbrow and intellectual. This, it
would appear, goes against STV's ethos which is, frankly, to produce
programmes which are inexpensive, downmarket, and appeal to a mass
audience.
This is all very well. There is nothing wrong (and, indeed, everything
right) with making popular programmes for the maximum number of viewers.
However -- and here's the rub -- the vitally important element of
quality must always be uppermost in the minds of the programme makers.
Sadly, this is not always the case with Scottish Television. Take its
new after-hours chat show, Late Edition, as a case in point. And take it
as far away as possible. Please.
Now, it's easy to knock a programme like Late Edition but, just
because something's easy, it doesn't mean it's not worth doing. Here we
have the last word in tackiness. A rare example of a truly awful
programme. There is no saving grace. It is dire. It is embarrassing. If
this is live television then someone should shoot it dead.
For those of you fortunate enough to have missed the programme, it
features Kirsty Young and Jim White (with a loud audience and an even
louder set) asking inane questions, many of them containing sexual
innuendo, of various eccentrics and personalities. It is clearly
designed for the apres-pub set (drunk is probably the only way to watch
it). Club 18-30 for television. Amateur night at the Empire. Gormless.
Kirsty Young, God bless her, might be a nice lady but you wouldn't
want to be handcuffed to a radiator in Beirut with her. Within a day
you'd have to inform the guard that she said something nasty about the
Prophet.
The really sad thing is that, excruciatingly bad though this show most
certainly is, it will probably earn reasonable viewing figures. So does
that vindicate Late Edition? Does a decent audience justify the
production of a shoddy and thoroughly tasteless show?
Of course it doesn't. STV should be suitably ashamed of itself for
coming up with this mind-numbing dross. It is harmful to Scottish
Television because it serves to bolster the argument (and it is an
argument often put forward in media circles) that the station's output
lacks that certain touch of class. That it is, not to put too fine a
point upon it, prone to vulgarity. Quality doesn't matter just so long
as it draws in the viewers and makes a few bucks for the shareholders.
This perception is unfortunate -- if for no other reason than it isn't
actually true. Okay, in drama terms STV cannot hold a candle to the
prolific and high-quality output of its direct competitor (BBC
Scotland's greatest strength is its drama, much of it for the network).
Yet Scottish's contribution to the ITV network is generally regarded
within the industry to be more than respectable for a station of its
size.
It is unashamedly popular -- ratings-friendly programmes like Taggart,
Dr Finlay, Win Lose or Draw, and Wheel of Fortune, all of which may not
be out there on the intellectual cutting edge but are nevertheless
regarded as both durable and dependable. STV is also by far the biggest
contributor of children's programmes to the network (with programmes
such as Art Attack, What's Up Doc?, and Disney Club). Indeed, last year
it produced four of the top 10 children's series on any UK network,
including the Beeb.
There is a risk here for STV, of course. These programmes, important
to the station's profitability, are produced at the whim of the
London-based network centre. In a cut-throat business where every
commercial station (and the big independent producers to boot) is
competing for prime-time slots, it needs only an adverse decision from
network programme controller Marcus Plantin to stop a series in its
tracks. Every series has its shelf life and one day, sooner or later,
Taggart will come to an end.
But STV maintains its real strength in its commitment to regional
programmes, of which the appalling Late Edition is probably the poorest
example so far. It is a fact, often ignored by the station's detractors,
that Scottish makes far more local programmes than any other commercial
station in the United Kingdom.
When last it applied to the ITC for its broadcasting licence (and
gained it for the princely sum of #2000), its success was largely due to
the fact that it promised a strong commitment to regional programming.
The ITC was very keen on the provision of local programming for a
station which serves the bulk of a region which is, in effect, a nation.
It would have accepted a commitment from STV to provide some 10 hours
a week of local programmes. In fact, the station provides double that
(18[1/2] hours of regional input plus 1[1/2] hours of Gaelic). It
doesn't have to; but it does.
And by committing itself to that 20 hours a week, about double the
network average, STV is spending some #20m a year. If it had gone for
10-hours-a-week (which the ITC would have accepted as reasonable) it
could have saved #10m a year.
It is also the case that STV's prolific regional output poses a
serious scheduling problem. There are only so many hours in the day and
airtime has to be found for all these programmes (which is why they are
often to be found in the early hours of the morning).
And it should also be kept in mind that every time STV opts out of a
network show in order to broadcast a local programme, it still has to
pay network centre for the programme it has rejected. Over a year this
amounts to a substantial sum of money. In addition, the station is
coming under increasing pressure to take network programmes. This is
partly because more and more programmes are being individually sponsored
-- and these sponsorship deals are secured on a national basis. If STV
opts out then it poses a problem for the network and the sponsors.
With all of this in mind, it is perhaps understandable that a station
which produces an inordinately high number of cheap programmes for local
consumption should make a few turkeys along the way. Some of its output
is good -- Scottish Women, Scottish Reporters, NB, Don't Look Down,
Chart Bite. Some are adequate -- High Road, Scottish Passport, The Home
Show. And some are just plain bad -- A Game of Two Halves, and (it has
to be said, I'm afraid) Scotland Today Lunchtime. There is, however, bad
and there is awful. And then there's Late Edition.
But at least Scottish Television doesn't pretend to be anything other
than what it is. Cheap, lowbrow, populist telly for the masses. It knows
its West of Scotland, working-class, market and it plays to its
strengths. It may not win awards by the barrowload; it may not stretch
the old brain cells. But, what the hell, who cares? It makes money and
it makes local programmes, some of them good. You don't like Late
Edition? Then don't watch it. You want Pride and Prejudice? Then switch
to the BBC.

ONE of the principal anti-crime measures announced by the Prime
Minister at the Tory conference earlier this month was under attack last
night as a ''bungled gimmick'' that fails to take Scotland into account.
Mr Major told cheering delegates that the Government will create a
national crime squad to tackle organised crime. However, in a written
parliamentary answer yesterday he disclosed that the matter was being
handled by Home Secretary Michael Howard, whose jurisdiction is limited
to England and Wales.
In his reply, Mr Major said: ''The Home Secretary is consulting with
the police and others on the establishment of a national crime squad. An
announcement will be made in due course.''
Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Alan Beith, who tabled the
question asking if the squad would operate in Scotland or Northern
Ireland, described it as ''very odd'' that Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth was not listed as among those being consulted.
Mr Beith said: ''It is obvious from this reply that the 'national
crime squad' which got such high billing at the Conservative conference
has not been worked out at all.''
Last night, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson shared Mr
Beith's puzzlement.''This is yet another bungled conference gimmick by
the Prime Minsiter which fails to recognise the distinctiveness of
Scotland's police force,'' he said.
A Scottish Office spokesman said his department was consulting with
interested parties, but judgment on the feasibility of the idea would be
reserved until the consultation was complete.

As Croatians prepare to go to the polls, Tom Gallagher warns of the
dangers from old-style communism and fascist nostalgia
CROATIA is holding elections next Sunday in order to capitalise on
President Tudjman's success this summer in winning back much of the
territory lost to rebel Serbs at the start of the war in former
Yugoslavia.
Living standards have tumbled for much of the population and economic
recovery is a distant mirage. But Tudjman is hoping that voters will
forget their material woes and reward him for his gains on the
battlefield.
His message to the outside world is that Croatia is a sentinel of
democracy holding the pass against the forces of Eastern tyranny and
backwardness as represented by Serbia as well as Russia and the Islamic
world. But if genuine democracy exists in Croatia it is deeply flawed
and likely to be on the retreat after the vote.
Seventy-three-year-old Tudjman is a vain autocrat who possesses deeply
authoritarian instincts even though he switched his allegiance from
Marshall Tito's communism to Croat nationalism in the 1960s. He dislikes
independent advice and has surrounded himself with advisers who tell him
what he wants to hear.
Ex-communists who, like him, have converted to nationalism have been
rewarded with plum jobs in the newly privatised economy. Many state
holdings have been distributed among cronies in Tudjman's party, the
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). Professional and independent business
people capable of promoting genuine economic reform that could revive
the country's fortunes, have been frozen out.
Opposition exists and is drawn from the ranks of the social democrat,
liberal, and regional parties. A new election law which insists on a
party passing a high minimum threshold of votes before entering
parliament, threatens to disenfranchise the opposition and distribute
its seats to the ruling HDZ. To avoid this fate, opposition alliances
have been formed. But this has resulted in the amount of air-time given
to the opposition in television broadcasts being sharply cut.
State control over the press and broadcasting in Croatia is tighter
even than in Serbia. A communications blackout even extends to private
homes.
One of the most respected critics of the regime is 67-year-old Bogdan
Denitch, a social democrat who divides his time between his job as a
sociology professor in the US and promoting reformist politics free of
nationalist taint in Croatia.
Along much of the Dalmatian coast, anti-fascist traditions still
remain alive and there is impatience with high-handed rule from Zagreb,
10 hours away by difficult roads. But Denitch is effectively isolated
because his phone and fax machines have been put out of action for all
but a few hours each day. A busy secret service also keeps a baleful eye
on many of Tudjman's critics.
Far more worrying was the apparent attempt on the life of the leader
of the biggest opposition party, the Social Liberals, on October 12.
Returning from an election rally, Drazen Budisa's car suddenly came upon
unmarked tree trunks in the middle of the road.
Luckily fog meant his vehicle was going slowly but those close to
Budisa suspect that an attempt may have been made to kill or injure both
him and the party workers travelling in a three-vehicle convoy.
These rough-house tactics are often associated with the Croatian
emigres from North America and Australia with whom Tudjman has
surrounded himself. Their money bankrolled his first successful
electoral campaign in 1990 when the dark side to his politics began to
be revealed. Addressing supporters, he publicly expressed his gratitude
that he was married neither to a Serb or a Jew.
There is no doubt that supporters of the Second World War Croat
fascist, Ante Pavelic, who carried out a reign of terror against
non-Croats on behalf of Hitler, are active string-pullers in emigre
ranks. North America has always been a haven for European extremists who
dabble in the politics of their homeland. Croatia's have been far more
successful in realising their fantasies than their Irish American
counterparts. Their money, connections, and access to weapons have
allowed them to fill the vacuum left by the fall of communism on their
own fundamentalist terms.
Croatia's Defence Minister, Gojko Susak, is the most successful of the
returned exiles. He rose from being the owner of a pizza parlour in
Toronto to being Minister of Defence of a European country at war in
1991. Alan Little and Laura Silber, authors of The Death of Yugoslavia,
on which an acclaimed BBC series has been based, allege that in July
1991, Susak personally shelled a Serb village in eastern Slavonia as
Croat-Serb hostilities were first getting under way. Today he is
received by top Nato officials and American diplomats who are apparently
unfazed by what he did then.
Susak has played a prominent role in overseeing the ethnic cleansing
of those Serbs who chose to stay in Krajina after it was overrun by
Croat forces in August. He hails from the Herzegovina region which
mainly lies in Bosnia, and his hand can be detected in the recent
decision to allow Croats from this part of Bosnia to vote in next
Sunday's election.
Tudjman's decision to grant this badge of citizenship to Croats who
belong to a neighbouring state rightly gives the Bosnian government
jitters. In 1993 when the emigre lobby was behind an attempt to annexe a
large slice of western Bosnia American intervention stopped that land
grab. But the Americans have, in public at least, been reluctant to
criticise Tudjman's intolerance at home and pursuit of ethnic cleansing
against innocent Serb civilians.
Tudjman is 73; with a liking for champagne and a history of heart
attacks, he may not have many years left to savour his victory. But the
danger is that he will be replaced by someone even more extreme who will
reach an accommodation with Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade that could
allow the triumph of intolerance across much of what was Yugoslavia.
Next door in Austria, Jorg Haider, the extreme-right demagogue, is
likely to take a giant step nearer to power in elections due by the New
Year. There is a real danger that the war in Yugoslavia and a backlash
against its effects in Austria, could allow the politics of neo-fascism
opportunities that have eluded it in Europe for 50 years.
Unless democratic Europe wakes up to the danger, Tudjman's successors
could be as much a menace to European security as hardline Serbs have
been in recent times.

Passengers are the winners as airlines battle for supremacy on the
Scotland-London route, reports Margaret Vaughan
THE sky has been, quite literally, the limit for Scots forking out for
air fares to London. How, for instance, could the big three carriers
justify a full return ticket price of #234 or so for what is the most
expensive 400-mile journey in Europe?
Easily, was the answer: because business travellers and those in a
hurry, those without the swollen wallets or the time or inclination to
swot up on the plethora of special offers, were prepared to pay the full
price for the convenience of reaching their destination swiftly.
The arrival of easyJet, an unknown airline offering a bargain-basement
service to Luton from Glasgow and Edinburgh, with prices starting at #29
one-way, and Ryanair with its no-frills, and no, not even a cup of
coffee, service between Prestwick and Stansted for as little as #59
return, has, if not shaken up, then at least stirred the existing
carriers.
British Midland and Air UK have both slashed ticket prices on a
limited number of seats on a limited number of flights to be seen to
compete with the market intruders. British Airways, meanwhile, is
keeping a wary eye on the new entrants into the lucrative market in
which it is the leader. It flies around two million passengers between
Glasgow and Edinburgh and London a year.
While the existing operators may not welcome aboard the new airlines,
their arrival is good news for travellers, according to Gordon Mowat,
the airline specialist with a leading Scottish travel group. If prices
are forced down then, he said, it is not before time: ''Fares on the
Scotland to London routes have been kept very, very high by the main
airlines.''
Since Ryanair announced its Prestwick/Stansted flights, which began
yesterday, AT Mays have taken somewhere between seven and eight thousand
bookings for the service. ''There has been huge interest in the past
month,'' Mowat said. ''They will be hoping to capture some business
traffic, but realistically probably only a little. Primarily, these
flights are aimed at the leisure travellers.''
The ticket prices on offer are roughly equivalent to train fares. The
operators aim, he believed, to divert business from the railways and
capture the first-time air travellers on what was a very expensive
route.
The rock-bottom prices, though, are what is known as a promotional
hook. It is an introductory promotional fare which both new operators
have brought in to capture the attention of travellers.
What you see is not, always, what you get in the world of marketing.
For instance, although easyJet advertises its #29 fare, the price
structure ranges from #29, to #39, #49, and #59 for seats on the same
flight. And the tickets are on a first-come first-served basis. In line
with other operators, the airline will not say what proportion of seats
on the aircraft will be at the bottom price or how many will be at the
top price.
The airline is a new entrant to the market. It operates no other
routes. It is therefore something of an unknown quantity, run by a Greek
family with shipping interests. It will sell tickets direct, to cut its
costs. And it will operate only one aircraft, a 737, on its six
54-minutes flights between Glasgow and Luton and one plane on its
Edinburgh route. Delays therefore may seem unavoidable if there is a
technical hitch.
Travellers will have to face a 10-minute shuttle bus transfer from
Luton airport to the railway link with a further 40-minute train journey
to Kings Cross.
Ryanair, buoyed by the success of its Glasgow to Eire service
introduced last year, is offering its #59 return fare between Prestwick
and Stansted with the added inducement of a free ScotRail ticket to any
destination in Scotland. But there are restrictions.
To qualify for the cheapest ticket, passengers have to spend a
Saturday night or two other nights in London and book one day in
advance. There will be a limited number of #59 tickets for sale. Other
seats on the same flights will be #69, #79, or #89 with the same
restrictions applying.
There is a #99 ticket, a same-day or overnight return which doesn't
need to be bought in advance. It will run eight flights a day, four each
way, again using a 737. Intending passengers have to travel 35 miles
from Glasgow to the Ayrshire airport, with a further 50-minute rail
journey at the other end to reach central London.
Air UK, which also operates flights to Stansted from both Glasgow and
Edinburgh, was quick to be seen to match the Ryanair prices. It
currently operates five times on weekdays from both Glasgow and
Edinburgh to Stansted as well as a similar number of flights to Gatwick.
It is the smallest of the big three, carrying around 600,000 air
travellers between Scotland and London every year.
A spokesman says its new #58 return tickets would be limited to a
number of seats on certain flights. ''Passengers would have to stay
overnight on a Saturday and there will be more of the cheapest seats
available, probably on lunchtime flights than on the busy early-morning
flights.'' He wouldn't say precisely how many such tickets would be
available. But it's unlikely to be more than 5% of seats on most
flights.
British Midland was swift to match the new competition from Ryanair
with a #58 offer and to threaten legal retribution if it did not stop
describing Prestwick as a Glasgow airport. This was seen as somewhat
ironic, given its long-stated intention to open up competition on the
London route, by challenging the hegemony once enjoyed by its major
competitor British Airways.
Both BA and Midland currently offer a confusing plethora of cut-price
tickets, hedged about with a long list of restrictions. A British
Airways spokeswoman listed 11 different price packages for flights to
Heathrow.
These range from a #74 return fare, involving midweek travel and a
Saturday overnight stay in London, with a maximum stay of one month,
with a limited number of tickets available, through a Weekend World
Offer at #107 return, to a 14-day Apex ticket to be bought a fortnight
ahead for #115, right up to the #234 executive return ticket, no
conditions, completely flexible and fully refundable.
So far it has not moved to match the cut-price deals from the new
planes on the block. It's not saying it will, and it's not saying it
won't.
An industry analyst said yesterday that the big three operators were
taking the intrusion seriously. ''It's a bit like the shuttle service
through the Channel Tunnel where it's not the ferry companies who have
lost out. Rather it's harming the airlines. The air routes to Paris are
under serious threat. They have had to reduce the price accordingly.''
While easyJet was, as yet, an unknown quantity, Ryanair had built its
reputation on its Eire service, pared to the bone on cost:
''Interestingly, they have not taken passengers away from Aer Lingus on
the Dublin route. What's happened is that more people are flying the
route.  They have expanded the market. That seems to be the intention on
the new route too.  That can only be good for air passengers, because
increased competition is healthy in holding down or reducing prices.''

SCOTS involved in the first lottery pay-outs to charities last night
hit back at criticism by former Heritage Minister, Mr David Mellor.
Mr Mellor came under fire for calling into question the #666,177 grant
to Strathclyde Poverty Alliance made by the National Lottery Charities
Board in Scotland. It was the largest award in the UK.
The Poverty Alliance group is an umbrella body which co-ordinates the
fight against poverty in the west of Scotland and supports more than
5000 community groups and has more than 80 member organisations.
Mr Mellor, MP for Putney, said the grant would be better going to an
established group like the Royal National Institute For The Blind in
Scotland which was ''doing really good work''.
Mr Damian Killeen, director of the SPA said Mr Mellor's comments were
''ill informed''.
Mr John Rafferty, director of the board in Scotland who announced
yesterday's grants north of the border, said he would not be commenting
directly on Mr Mellor's criticisms.
However, Mr Rafferty said: ''The facts in this case speak for
themselves. Strathclyde Poverty Alliance has been on the go since 1985
and was conceived with local government funding. Only six months ago,
the Scottish Office agreed to give them a grant of #33,700 for their
young persons project.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson described Mr Mellor's
comments as ''yet another Tory gaffe''. Mr Robertson said: ''Here we
have another example of a Tory blundering around, ignorant of what is
going on in Scotland.
''This is a very important project. Both Michael Forsyth, through
Scottish Office funding, and myself think that Strathclyde Poverty
Alliance is doing a good job.''
The row came as 223 Scottish charities and community groups shared a
#17.6m pay-out for anti-poverty groups from lottery funds. Nine hundred
and seventy-seven other grant applications were unsuccessful.
Scotland received nearly half of all the cash distributed in Britain
by lottery chiefs. The full UK programme of grants covered 627 charities
and is worth #40m.
Mr Mellor singled out the grant to the Strathclyde group, saying
instead of funding organisations which stood to lose from the lottery,
the board had decided to award a big cash sum to organisations like the
Scottish group.
Mr Mellor said there had been an element of ''political correctness''
to the grants.
He told the BBC's Radio Four World At One programme that the lottery
board was a creaky old tub ''piled full of some of the usual suspects of
politically correct vehicles''.
As the cash pay-outs were announced by Mr Rafferty in Edinburgh, there
was a warning about the lottery grant system and its effect on existing
charities.
The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, an umbrella
organisation for 700 charities and voluntary organisations, said the
lottery must be changed better to reflect social needs and priorities.
Although welcoming the cash pay-outs, SCVO director Martin Sime said:
''Too much of the lottery cake is being eaten by private profit and
Government tax.''
A regional breakdown shows that Strathclyde received 43% of the total,
Lothian 20%, with others 8% or below. Mr Rafferty said the first-phase
pay-outs were poverty based and it was clear ''the worst areas of
deprivation exist in Strathclyde and Lothian''.

Kirsty Scott highlights new concern over BSE and a link to human
illness.
THE NEWS that a fourth cattle farmer may be suffering from the human
equivalent of mad cow disease has cast a fresh shadow over the debate on
the BSE epidemic and its potential risk to human health.
In the latest case -- leaked to the press on Sunday -- a farmer from
the north of Wales was said to have had a case of BSE in his herd and
has now been struck down by an incurable brain illness, suspected to be
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
Three farmers are known to have died from CJD and the latest suspected
case comes hot on the heels of a report which suggests that consumers
have eaten meat from more than 1.5 million cows infected by BSE or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy. It is also believed that a report from
the Consumers Association, due out next month, will express concern
about the incidence of BSE in cattle.
Government sources and farmers' representatives went on the defensive
yesterday, stressing that, so far, there is no proven link between BSE
and CJD, and rallying round official and industry efforts to tackle the
cattle epidemic. But sources from the scientific community are calling
for an independent inquiry into the handling of the affair and warned
that a possible link between the two diseases cannot now be glibly
dismissed.
Professor Richard Lacey, a microbiologist from Leeds University and
one of the leading critics of the Government's policy on BSE, said
yesterday that he had looked into the latest case and the symptoms were
clinically typical of CJD. He said it was now time for an independent
inquiry into the Government's handling of the BSE crisis and warned that
we may be seeing the tip of the iceberg in terms of the effect on
humans.
''You would occasionally expect CJD to occur in farmers but we have
had four cases in three years,'' he said. ''The chances of that
happening by chance is less than one in 10,000, so it is statistically
significant. The frightening implication of that is that it establishes
that CJD is caused by BSE. It's the same disease . . . we have the most
terrible crisis.
''I want to see an independent inquiry into the Government handling of
the issue. Up to now there has been one case of CJD per million people
per year. We have 20,000 dairy farmers, so we should expect one case in
dairy farmers every 50 years. We have had four cases in three years.
It's highly significant.''
At the Government's CJD surveillance unit at Edinburgh's Western
General Hospital, Dr Martin Zeidler insisted that there was no proven
link between CJD and BSE, and that the incidence in the UK was similar
to elsewhere in the world.
Dr Zeidler said the question must arise whether the cases of the three
farmers was simply a ''statistical quirk'', but added: ''However, I
think it indicates that we need to continue monitoring the incidence of
the disease very carefully.''
Recent figures show that the number of CJD cases in the UK rose to 55
last year from 42 the previous year. In Scotland, however, the figure
fell during the same period from seven cases to four.
In all, 153,674 cases of BSE have been confirmed on 32,835 farms in
the UK, 7390 of those in Scotland. The Government claim that the
measures they introduced were clearly affecting the course of the
epidemic, but in June of this year it was announced that new curbs would
be introduced at slaughter houses because the rules designed to wipe out
the disease were not working 100% effectively, and feed infected by BSE
was leaking into the cattle's food chain.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said the number of BSE cases north
of the Border had been dropping dramatically, with 2208 cases in 1993,
1326 in 1994, and 449 so far this year.
Consumption of beef in the British market dropped by 20% immediately
after the crisis erupted, but the Meat and Livestock Commission said
yesterday that it had recovered within 12 months, and figures were up by
1% last year at 921,000 tonnes.
Exports were also badly hit initially with millions of pounds lost in
trade. Last month it was reported that the Germans, who were acutely
concerned at the impact of BSE, were keen to see the export market
reopened. The MLC said exports of beef had risen from 124,000 tonnes in
1990 to 235,000 last year.
A spokesman for the National Farmers Union in Scotland said yesterday
that their members felt they were probably over the worst of the problem
now, but were keen for the situation to be monitored because there were
still a lot of unknowns about BSE and its transmission within a herd.

A MULTI-MILLION pound partnership deal to tackle housing and economic
development in Stirling, Clackmannan, and Falkirk will be signed today
by Scottish Homes and Forth Valley Enterprise.
The agreement is thought to be one of the first of its kind in
Scotland.
Scottish Homes and Forth Valley Enterprise will have joint
responsibility for the regeneration of town centres and designated
priority areas of the districts.
Scottish Homes chief executive Peter McKinlay said he believed it
would have positive and tangible benefits in terms of housing and jobs.
Mr Robert Taylor, chairman of Forth Valley Enterprise, said both
organisations had enjoyed a ''fruitful'' relationship which had now
become a more formal working agreement.

A MOTHER accused of murdering her three children was freed by an Old
Bailey judge yesterday after the prosecution dropped all charges against
her.
Mr David Calvert-Smith, prosecuting, said Mrs Daphne Thorne's
confessions that she had suffocated three of her babies over a number of
years could not be relied on as true.
''Without the evidence of her confessions, it is impossible for any
jury to be satisfied either that they were unlawfully killed -- or, if
so, by whom.''
The Common Serjeant of London, Judge Neil Denison, said her case had
been considered by ''a bevy of distinguished experts''. They had all
''expressed the view that her confessions cannot be relied upon'', he
said.
The judge requested she should be discharged into the care of the
social services after her defence counsel asked for her to be
''supported and rehabilitated'' rather than being released straight on
to the streets.
Mrs Thorne, from Dagenham, east London, had been charged with the
murders of her three sons, Peter, 13 months, Gary, eight months, and
Ian, seven months.
Each baby had been originally diagnosed as having died from natural
causes but after Mrs Thorne had a fourth child, it was decided she
should see Professor Samuel Meadow in Leeds. He is a world expert on
Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy -- a mental disorder which forces sufferers
to seek attention for themselves by simulating injuries or actually
injuring others.
Mrs Thorne travelled to meet the professor accompanied by a social
worker and a policewoman. While with the social worker ''she became
hysterical and said she had done something very bad,'' said Mr
Calvert-Smith.
''She proceeded to admit she had suffocated all three babies. She was
arrested on her arrival at Leeds, where she repeated her admissions.''
After she returned to London, police asked her whether she thought she
had done what she claimed.
She replied: ''Half of me says yes and half of me says no.'' She was
then asked if she was seeking attention and she responded: ''I could be.
I would do anything to seek attention.''
Mr Calvert Smith said a detective asked whether she had really killed
her babies. She had replied: ''I do not know''.
When again asked, ''Is it true?'' she said, ''Most probably in the
case of Ian.''
She was charged in June 1994 but her trial, due to be held early this
year, was delayed while expert medical and psychiatric evidence about
her and the children was collected.
In March, an ''eminent'' psychologist expressed doubts on whether it
would be safe to rely on her self-incriminating evidence. A psychiatrist
agreed.
By July, a further report commissioned by the defence from a
distinguished paediatrician concluded that Peter and Ian could well have
died from medical conditions and Gary could have been a cot death.
A psychiatrist was approached for the prosecution and reported: ''Mrs
Thorne's admissions in regard to her children cannot be relied upon.''
Mr Calvert-Smith said that ''after exhaustive and agonising
deliberations, prosecution has decided it would be wrong to proceed in
this case''.
The judge agreed, adding: ''It is absolutely plain to me that if the
confessions cannot be relied upon, the Crown have no case. It is as
simple as that.''
'Without the evidence of her confessions, it is impossible for any
jury to be satisfied either that they were unlawfully killed -- or, if
so, by whom'

ORGANISATIONS the length and breadth of Scotland were last night
expressing delight at being included in a major batch of National
Lottery cash hand-outs for the country.
The first wave of monies announced in Edinburgh by the National
Lottery Charities Board in Scotland will fund a new breast cancer study
examining why women in the most wealthy parts of Glasgow have a better
survival rate than those in poorer areas.
Scientific director of Cancer Research Campaign Scotland Professor
Gordon McVie said they were ''absolutely delighted'' at receiving the
#201,800 to help fund this important area of research.
''We applaud their decision to support top-class research, which we
believe vindicates the very public stand we have taken and mirrors the
many calls and letters of support we have received from ordinary folk
who feel as we do that research into cancer is worthy of Lottery
support.''
Quarriers, one of Scotland's longest established and largest
charities, warmly welcomed its award of #111,943 spread over a
three-year period.
The money will support a new mobile outreach advice service for young
people aged 16 to 25, including young parents, living in the remote
communities of North Argyll.
Meanwhile, a #300,000 award to the Prince's Trust will be used to help
develop Study Support in Scotland helping thousands of young Scots.
Study support centres provide students with a secure place to study
outside of school hours. The money will help establish more centres in
Strathclyde and Lothian.
Applications from six Citizens Advice Bureaux in Scotland brought a
grant of nearly #1m.
A spokeswoman said it represented a very welcome acknowledgment of the
work done by the CAB in Scotland across a wide range of issues and
concerns.
Lone parents in Greater Easterhouse, in Glasgow, were celebrating the
award of nearly #45,000. The money will be used to set up a custom-built
child care facility, information resource unit, training rooms and
office space.
Ms Laura McCreadie, project co-ordinator of the Lone Parents Forum
said: ''We are extremely pleased with this award which means that the
final piece of money is now in place for our project.''
The Glasgow-based Volunteer Development Programme, run by the Royal
National Institute for Deaf People, is a pilot project which will
provide retraining opportunities to unemployed, elderly and disabled
people in the Glasgow area.
Ms Lilian Lawson, service director for RNID Services for Scotland,
commenting on its #134,684 award, said the ''extremely good news'' came
at a time when it was facing increasing pressure on all sources of
income.
Organisers at Western Isles Women's Aid in Stornoway, which provides
refuge and support services to women who have been abused and their
children, described the ''euphoria'' on learning of the #83,645 grant.
In Grampian Mr Barry Richards of Voluntary Service Aberdeen, which
receives #458,445, said it was a great boost and would allow them to
help an extra 400 families and increase the grants it provided.
VSA provides a wide range of social and community services.
Mr Bob Blewitt, appeals director at Strathcarron Hospice, Denny,
Stirlingshire, which provides care to terminally ill people in Central
Scotland, said he was very pleased about the announcement.
The #226,412 grant will be used to finance the services provided by
homecare nursing teams. At present the five homecare sisters look after
140 families.
On Tayside Ms Jane MacFarlane, managing director of Dundee Cyrenians
Night Shelter Ltd, which receives #39,070 said that the money would help
with their new purpose-built hostel which would give each of the elderly
homeless people their own room and some privacy compared to their
previous accommodation where there were 19 men in one dormitory.
Lothian Shop Mobility, which was established and is managed by
disabled people to provide, free of charge, a range of mobility aids to
help people undertake shopping trips within the region, receives
#173,795.
The political parties reacted cautiously to the Edinburgh
announcement. Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said that while
welcoming awards to many worthy charities he was concerned that, because
of the excessive profits made by Camelot, not enough money was actually
finding its way to good causes.
''That is why Labour is seeking an efficient non-profit-making
promoter for the Lottery.
''Labour also believes the present system of applications should be
reassessed to minimise unnecessary bureaucracy.''
Ms Roseanna Cunningham MP, for the SNP, said it was much-deserved
money coming to Scots charities but the best way to disburse money
raised north of the Border was through a Scottish lottery.
Ms Ray Michie, MP, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, welcomed the
fact Scots charities had received a substantial proportion of the
Lottery award, but added: ''This pattern will have to be repeated in the
next few awards if the impression that pay-outs are biased towards
London and the South is to be corrected.''

Strasbourg
AMERICAN-style warnings about the dangers of alcohol -- particularly
for expectant mothers -- should be made compulsory in Europe, Mr Bill
Miller, Labour Euro-MP, said yesterday.
Mr Miller will seek backing for his idea today from the European
Parliament when it debates food labelling. Euro-MPs will vote on the
issue tomorrow.
With the backing of 62 Labour Euro-MPs, Mr Miller wants food labelling
laws harmonised to include a health warning on bottles and cans of
alcoholic drinks as well as on advertisements for liquor.
He says he is particularly concerned about alcohol's effects on
pregnant women. Mr Miller, whose parents ran a pub, said many people
were unaware of the health risks associated with drinking during
pregnancy.
''I like a drink and I do not want to stop others from having fun,''
he said, ''but I do think people should be made more aware of the
dangers, particularly during pregnancy.'' He suggested a slogan could
be: ''When you're pregnant, you never drink alone.''
He said he did not accept that general health education was enough to
counter the dangers of alcohol: ''For very #1 spent by brewers on health
education, #100 is spent advertising alcohol. The balance is wrong.''
He argued that there was an extra need for warnings about excessive
drinking now that distillers had lifted their voluntary ban on
advertising on television.
Mr Miller said he would continue his campaign even if the Parliament
rejected his amendment.

Moscow
RUSSIA has agreed to lift the curtain on hundreds of thousands of
classical music recordings never before heard outside the former Soviet
Union.
''The Russian Government has given the full go-ahead at last,'' said
Tristan Del, chairman of the Los Angeles-based firm Phoenix
Entertainment. ''The first release will most likely be at the beginning
of next year.''
Under an agreement reached in 1992 but held up by legal disputes,
Phoenix will enjoy exclusive rights to a rare musical archive estimated
to be worth some #6000m.
Distribution will be handled by the British firm Telstar Records, said
Del, describing the deal as ''one of the most important cultural
projects of the century''.
However it has drawn strong criticism from some sections of the
Russian media, apparently concerned about the rights to the precious
archives being given to a foreign company.
The recordings, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000, include Paul
Robeson singing in Moscow, Artur Rubinstein, Yehudi Menuhin, Luciano
Pavarotti, and folk singer Pete Seeger.
Among the better-known Russian artists whose music will be made
available are pianist-composer Dmitry Shostakovich, Mstislav
Rostropovich, and pianists Emil Gilels and Svyatoslav Richter.
The recordings date from the 1930s and were originally the property of
the Soviet All-Union Television and Radio Broadcasting Company
(Gostelradio), which became the Ostankino company after the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991.
The deal was signed in 1992 with Ostankino, which was transformed this
year into Russian Public Television.
Del, a Canadian of Russian origin, declined to give financial details
of the profit-sharing arrangement but it does allow for royalties to be
paid to the musicians, who received a pittance in Soviet times, or to
their estates.
Del said Phoenix had to overcome ''tremendous opposition and
disinformation'' to win approval for the project.
''We've been called many names in the press here,'' he said, adding
that he had launched legal proceedings against Russian Culture Minister
Yevgeny Sidorov and pianist Nikolai Petrov.
Jack Dorsey, a leading British music producer, said some of the
recordings in the archive were in badly decayed but could be restored by
technology.
''We intend to restore as many of these recordings as possible,'' he
said.--Reuter.

A PUBLIC fund-raising campaign is being launched to help set up a
university in the Highlands.
Civic and educational partners in the project have already contributed
more than #1m.
It is hoped to establish a federal institution, with existing colleges
linked by computer, early next decade.
Last night, project director Robin Lingard admitted the challenge had
become ''very demanding''.
Mr Lingard told members of Inverness District Council: ''It is now
clear that we will need to approach a far wider range of funding sources
if we are to speed up the project.
''We have already made a major bid to the Millenium Commission for
capital which would help us create a high-quality campus at each major
site of the UHI network.
''A company, limited by guarantee, has been established to hold
donations and plans are being drawn up for a public fund-raising
campaign.''

A SECONDHAND car dealer who swindled vehicle owners all over Scotland
out of #130,000, has been sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
Ronnie Marshall, 45, born in Glasgow's East End, obtained motors by
deception between October and December, 1991, promising to pay off
outstanding HP sums.
However, Paisley Sheriff Court heard how he sold the vehicles on and
failed to honour his promise to clear remaining debt, leaving former
owners still liable.
A total of 27 Scots were caught in the con, including victims as far
afield as Glasgow, Edinburgh, Livingston, Stonehaven, Kirkcaldy, Crieff,
Turriff, Dundee, Perth, Bishopbriggs, Stirling, Kilmarnock, Greenock,
Shotts, and Erskine.
Operating as the Paisley Car Centre based in the town's Abercorn
Street, and later as Lothian Performance Cars from premises at Rutland
Square, Edinburgh, Marshall defrauded innocent clients by placing a
series of ads offering to purchase cars and clear outstanding HP
payments.
Those who trusted him were left without a vehicle but still lumbered
with the debt.
In a similar scam south of the Border that led to a prosecution in the
Midlands two years ago, Marshall, 45, was jailed for three years.
He had obtained cars worth more than #90,000 in that operation.
He admitted the latest offences when he appeared in custody at Paisley
Sheriff Court three weeks ago and had his case continued for social
background reports.
Defence counsel claimed yesterday that Marshall had gained nothing
from the scam other than the #150 per week wages he was paid by those he
worked for. He had been promised a substantial cash sum from profits but
had never received any payment.
When he appeared for sentence yesterday, Sheriff James Spy condemned
his behaviour, saying he had used and abused innocent people who had
lost their cars and remained in debt to HP companies.
A custodial sentence, he said, was inevitable.

<TEXT>
ROBERT Maxwell prided himself on his ability to meet all his banking
obligations, his son told an Old Bailey jury yesterday.
Mr Kevin Maxwell said that for this reason his father did not want ''a
standstill'' on loan repayments (as recently invoked by Eurotunnel, for
example) when the group had liquidity problems in mid-1991.
He said his father preferred to negotiate loans or new agreements with
individual bankers rather than opting for a standstill.
''He prided himself on his ability to meet all his obligations. He
had, in his terms, for over 40 years never failed to honour a banking
commitment and banking obligations.''
Mr Maxwell, the publisher's youngest son, has spent much of his six
days in the witness box dealing with the intricacies of business
practice.
The longest standing bank relationship his father had was with the
NatWest. It began soon after the war and had lasted for 40 years.
NatWest had stood by him in the 1970s when he was the subject of a DTI
inquiry and its support had been repaid when Maxwell came back strongly
in business in the next decade.
However, Mr Kevin Maxwell told the court the relationship with NatWest
changed in 1991, when a new executive, Mr Bob Brown, began dealing
directly with the Maxwells.
He said Mr Brown's attitude was that of a ''hatchet man'' determined
to reduce the bank's exposure to the Maxwell connection ''willy nilly''.
He refused loans and ''clung like a limpet'' to shares in an Israeli
company, Scitex, which the Maxwells were selling.
Mr Maxwell, 36, denies conspiring with his father in 1991 to defraud
the pension scheme by misusing the Scitex shares to meet private Maxwell
Company obligations. He also denies along with his brother Ian, 39, and
former Maxwell adviser Larry Trachtenberg, 42, a similar charge
concerning #22m of shares in another Israeli company, Teva.
The trial continues.

INTERCITY has the worst public image of any of Britain's biggest and
best-known companies.
The rail service came last for value for money in a list of 25 of the
country's highest-profile firms in a survey of 1100 consumers.
Train chiefs said last night the name InterCity could soon be dropped
because it was associated with past problems.
According to the survey by research analysts Mintel, high street chain
Boots easily has the best image.
Apart from the value-for-money table, Boots topped polls for being
trusted, understood, and ''in touch'' with customers.
However, InterCity polled poorly, even though the company has been
split up and is run by a number of regional networks.
A spokesman for InterCity West Coast said: ''The trouble with
InterCity is that when it is good, everyone takes it for granted --
trains are expected to run on time.
''But when it is bad, then everyone remembers the mistakes and its
image really suffers.''
The survey of 25 companies was dominated by Boots, followed closely by
Tesco, Sainbury's, the BBC, Safeway, and Virgin.
The Body Shop was named as the company most concerned with
environmental issues -- with Boots coming second.
The value-for-money results were: 1 Boots, 2 Tesco, 3 Sainsbury's, 4
BBC, 5 Safeway, 6 Virgin, 7 Body Shop, 8 Cadbury's, 9 BT, 10 McDonald's,
11 Thomson, 12 British Gas, 13 BA, 14 Lever Brothers, 15 Procter &amp;
Gamble, 16 Coca Cola, 17 Mercury, 18 Hoover, 19 Nestle Rowntree, 20 ICI,
21 Esso, 22 Shell, 23 Whirlpool, 24 BP, and 25 InterCity.

Paris
A FRENCH lawyer briefly rocked the Paris money market today by
declaring that he had asked a state prosecutor to rule if President
Jacques Chirac could be prosecuted over a rented flat.
The franc plunged, then recovered in a bout of frantic dealing.
Chirac has leased the apartment from a Paris-subsidised housing firm
since he was the city's mayor.
Two weeks ago Prime Minister Alain Juppe narrowly escaped prosecution
over his low-rent apartment leased from the City of Paris.
Lawyer Pierre-Francois Divier said he wanted the prosecutor to
investigate whether Chirac had illegally interfered in the purchase of
the elegant Left Bank flat, which he has rented since 1977, by a company
partly owned by the City of Paris.
The satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported last March that
Paris's Municipal Buildings Management Company (SGIM) had bought the
flat for #1.3m in 1990, allegedly to save Chirac from possible eviction
or a sharp rent increase.
It said Chirac was paying a low monthly rent of F11,000 (#1466) for
the spacious ground-floor apartment with a private garden in a highly
desirable central area and the lease had been rolled over without an
increase after SGIM acquired it.--Reuter.

Canberra
AN AUSTRALIAN university plans to use tear-wrenching novels to teach
student nurses how to be kinder to suffering patients.
First-year nursing students at northern Queensland state's Griffith
University will be asked to sob their way through novels such as Emily
Bronte's Wuthering Heights and Janet Frame's An Angel at My Table to
help them learn about death and loss.
Bachelor of Nursing co-ordinator Wendy Moyle said: ''It makes them
more compassionate, that's want we want, that's what we hope for.''
Wuthering Heights is a 150-year-old classic tale of love and
separation and An Angel at My Table an acclaimed modern autobiography of
grief, loss, and mental suffering.
Combined with standard scientific texts and lectures, the university
will use novels, poetry, and music to deepen students' learning, Moyle
said.
Griffith is the first university to try this novel approach to
teaching compassion since nurse training moved to Australian
universities from hospital-based training in the late 1980s.
Moyle said the course aimed to shift the focus of nursing education
from hi-tech medical machinery back to the patient.
''We have to refocus the profession on human beings,'' she
said.--Reuter.

THE witching hour came early for the children of greater Easterhouse
in Glasgow yesterday.
The grim reaper and a screaming ghoul were among a gallery of ghosts
who launched a week-long Hallowe'en party for estate school pupils and
youth clubs at Provan Hall House in Auchinlea Park. The event, now in
its fifth year, is funded by the Greater Easterhouse Initiative and will
last until October 31.
Behind the masks were senior drama pupils from Bannerman High School,
who will lead more than 650 children around the haunted
sixteenth-century house. Spectral spectacles will include a strobe-lit
cell, a severed head, and a three-dimensional projection of a ghostly
clansman playing chess.
Children who complete the tour, which begins with a talk about the
origins of the house, will receive a certificate.
Of the first batch shown round the building, a class from Provan Hall
Primary, only Ashleigh Gomes, 10, braved every room and came out to tell
the tale. ''I was here last year and it was scarier,'' she said.

KNIFE crime in Strathclyde is edging up once again, blighting an
otherwise optimistic set of reported crime figures issued yesterday by
Chief Constable Leslie Sharp.
The chief constable expressed disappointment that the stop and search
part of Operation Eagle, which concentrates on drugs, had not had a
greater effect on the knife carriers and he hinted that if knife assault
continued to increase, Operation Blade -- a hugely-successful stop and
search operation which attacked the knife-carrying culture head on --
might me revived.
He also reported that, of the 5500 people reported so far to the
procurator-fiscal in the course of Operation Eagle, more than a third
were drug dealers.
He was aware, he agreed, that the majority were returning to the
streets on bail more or less immediately.
But, he added: ''This is not significant. One of the problems we had
was locating where the drug dealers were. A significant proportion of
those reported to the fiscal were not previously known to us. We had no
record of them and the information has come to us on the various help
lines. There is no large-scale evidence of them going straight back into
drug dealing. Eagle has stirred the public's interest and that has
attracted the information we wanted.''
Operation Eagle, he said, was not meant to be a solution to anything.
In purely policing terms they had put more significant resources into
illegal drugs dealing than they had ever done before.
''We were trying to show people that something could be done about
drugs. I think that was important because at the time there was a
growing voice for decriminalisation or legalisation and they were going
to win by default if something concrete was not done,'' he said.
The Chief Constable said he expected Eagle to have a significant
effect on the year's crime figure decrease, standing yesterday at 5.6%
or 11,447 fewer recorded crimes in the first nine months of this year.
He dismissed the notion that the figures were massaged to make the force
look good.
''The decrease in crime figures in Strathclyde has now been so
consistent and so over the average that there is clearly an indication
that it really is going down. This is at a time when the Scottish Crime
Survey says quite clearly that a greater proportion of crime is being
reported to the police than ever before,'' he said.
He took as an example the fact that 1800 fewer thefts of cars had been
reported in the period, and these were crimes which people did not
ignore. There was also a 13% decrease in vehicle break-ins. The decrease
in domestic housebreakings, a reduction of 19%, was also significant.
He put the fall in reported dishonesty crimes down to the crime
prevention drip feed finally getting through, with the result that
people were taking more care of their property.
However, he expressed concern at the continued rise of violence in
Strathclyde, 69 unlawful killings, 58% of them involving knives, this
year so far compared with 52 over the same period last year and a 14%
rise in reported serious assaults, many involving knives.

THE press has made great progress in making self-regulation work but
more efforts are needed to avoid the imposition of statutory controls,
the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission warned last night.
Lord Wakeham outlined a series of proposals including measures to make
the PCC's procedures more accessible and responsive to the public, the
introduction of Citizen's Charter-style performance targets for its
work, and stronger public participation in the industry's Code of
Practice.
He warned: ''A series of unwise stories from the newspapers could blow
us off course; the pressures of an impending election could again make
politicians more nervous about their relationship with the fourth
estate.''
Lord Wakeham, delivering the Harold Macmillan Lecture at Nottingham
Trent University, said the relationship between those who exercised
power on behalf of the people and those who scrutinised it on behalf of
their readers always had been and always would be a tense one.
''But in recent years, that tension has been stretched to breaking
point. It cannot be right for a relationship so fundamental to democracy
to be conducted in the brawling atmosphere of the last chance saloon,''
he said.
Lord Wakeham said his central aim as PCC chairman was to remove the
''sword of Damocles'', the threat of statutory controls and privacy
legislation suspended over the head of the press.
He spoke of initiatives already taken to strengthen self-regulation
and said dividends were being paid for that success. The decision in the
summer not to introduce privacy laws or statutory regulation had been a
watershed for the PCC, he said: ''It signalled that we were beginning to
emerge from the troubles of recent years.''
Lord Wakeham identified several reasons why the relationship between
press and Parliament had changed during the 1980s.
''As news became a 24-hour operation, a new generation came into
being: the spin doctors and the ad men in both parties, whose rivalry
for the headlines became increasingly bitter. In the bitterness, an
intolerance was born: intolerance of newspapers that did not always do
what they were supposed to do.''
The press had made remarkable strides forward in buttressing
self-regulation, he said: ''In the next five years, we will do even more
in achieving the three-card trick: protection for the public; effective
procedures; maintenance of centuries of press freedom.''
Lord Wakeham concluded: ''What we are seeking to put in place is a
stable, enduring, and fair framework within which public, politicians,
and press can resolve their differences tolerantly, effectively, without
burden on the public purse, and without undermining in any way the
freedoms of speech and expression which have been our precious
birthright since Magna Carta.''

United Nation
JOHN MAJOR today demanded the scrapping of a series of costly United
Nations agencies in a bid to shape the organisation for the 21st
century.
At the 50th anniversary of the UN in New York, he bluntly warned that
it faced bankruptcy unless it was reformed quickly.
British diplomats backed the warning with a thinly veiled threat to
hold back cash for UN bodies that the government believes are outdated
or unnecessary.
The Prime Minister used the five-minute slot allocated to each of the
149 heads of state and government attending the massive three-day
jamboree to urge the UN to face up to new priorities in a rapidly
changing world.
''Too much time is spent on the ritual verbal battles, brilliantly
interpreted into six languages and printed on the world's highest paper
mountain,'' he said.
Mr Major called for an expanded governing Security Council with the
clear implication that Germany and Japan should be allowed to join
Britain, the United States, France, China, and Russia as permanent
members.
The UN is now facing its gravest financial crisis, crippled by late
payment of dues by the United States and other countries.
Mr Major called for late payers to be threatened with losing their
vote in decision-making -- off-setting the demand with pressure for
reform of the complex system of assessment of individual countries'
donations.
However the main target of his speech appeared to be the host of
semi-independent agencies which work in the UN's name, and which
Ministers believe are wasteful and inefficient.
The Prime Minister named no names but diplomats said the British
Government wanted a long, hard look to be taken at bodies like Unesco,
the International Labour Organisation, the various regional economic
commissions, and Unctad, the trade and development commission.
Each of them soaks up millions of pounds a year and the government
believes that many simply duplicate the work of other organisations and
agencies.
Mr Major issued his warning as a ''candid friend'' of the UN and
insisted that the organisation still had a key role to play in
international relations.
''We need a properly financed and efficient United Nations. I want
change because I want the UN to succeed,'' he said.
The Prime Minister said the UN should sharpen up its act in managing
and financing peacekeeping and in working to head off conflicts before
they started.
There were also stern warnings for countries in payment arrears and of
the problem of possible financial crisis.
US and British diplomats believe a system in which 15 countries picked
up the bill for over 80% of the UN's costs is outdated and unfair.
Britain alone has spent #1bn over the past two years on the general UN
budget and peacekeeping commitments.
President Bill Clinton pledged at the opening session of the summit
yesterday to work to persuade a hostile Congress to release the #1bn the
US owes -- equivalent to the entire UN budget for the year.
In a passage clearly aimed at the Clinton administration, Mr Major
said: ''The UN is in financial crisis. It is not sustainable for member
states to enjoy representation without taxation. Contributions should be
paid promptly and in full and arrears cleared.
''But this must be accompanied by a new focus on efficiency and by
modernising assessment to reflect the changing capacity of countries to
pay.''

Italy's hard-line communists decided to line up with the centre-right

''We will vote for the motion of no-confidence because our goal is to
help oust a government whose performance has been terrible. This is our
priority,'' Communist Refoundation party leader Fausto Bertinotti told a
news conference.
With the other parties already declared for and against Dini, the
Marxist party's 24 MPs held the balance between victory and defeat in
the vote.
A Cabinet official said the debate, moved by former Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi, would start tomorrow.
The vote, which Dini looked set to lose on current projections, is
scheduled to be held on Thursday.
However, some commentators still suggested all was not lost for the
former central banker, who could yet be saved by last-minute abstentions
and sudden changes of heart.
The Cabinet under-secretary for relations with Parliament, Guglielmo
Negri, told reporters that the Prime Minister had called for the debate
to start as quickly as possible ''because Dini knows the need to avoid
speculation against the lira''.
Defeat for Dini in the confidence vote could mean the country's 1996
draft budget being blocked by a bitterly divided Parliament and the
strong likelihood of an early General Election.
''In their own party interests, the right and extreme left have joined
together in a bid to sink the budget and send Italy into chaos,'' said
centre-left MP Mario Segni.
Maurizio Gasparri of the far-right National Alliance said his party
wanted immediate elections either in December or March at the latest.
Berlusconi moved to bring down Dini, who took office last January
after the collapse of Berlusconi's government, after Justice Minister
Filippo Mancuso was ousted last week in a no-confidence debate in the
Senate.
Mancuso's removal was prompted by steps he took against Milan
magistrates who have ordered billionaire businessman Berlusconi to stand
trial on corruption charges.
The latest voting predictions saw Dini backed by 308 MPs while the
centre right would have 317. Just two members said they were
undecided.--Reuter.

VETERAN Aberdeen MP Bob Hughes has decided to end his parliamentary
career after more than a quarter of a century, following his defeat for
the candidacy of Aberdeen Central at the hands of a fellow MP.
Mr Hughes was chosen as the prospective parliamentary candidate for
Aberdeen North by a single vote and went on to retain the seat for more
than 25 years. A single vote also caused his present situation.
When Boundary Commission changes radically altered the constituency he
put his name forward for the new Aberdeen Central constituency but the
one vote meant his defeat by Mr Frank Doran, former MP for Aberdeen
South.
Mr Hughes clearly was deeply shocked by the defeat in a democratic
process which he was instrumental in introducing. He declined to make
any comment until yesterday.
''This is the hardest thing I have had to do,'' he said as he issued
the press release announcing his retiral.
Throughout the weekend, he had discussed his future with family and
friends and many had urged him to stand in the new North Aberdeen and
use his experience to win the seat for Labour.
Although the seat does look like one which Labour is likely to win,
particularly with a candidate of the stature and personal following of
Mr Hughes, the 63-year-old has decided not to stand.
He said: ''I have reflected on my position since last Thursday's
events. I had discussions with friends and colleagues in Aberdeen and
although there was a very strong view that I should carry on, when the
next election comes I will have done 27 years as a Member of Parliament
in Aberdeen -- that's longer than the average Member of Parliament's
career -- and I am very proud of that and grateful to the Labour Party
and the electors for sending me to Parliament and giving me such a
superb opportunity.
''I believe on balance the new North Aberdeen seat needs a new Labour
MP and I look forward to working to achieve that.''
He said he did not take the view that it would be harder for a new
candidate to win the seat.
''I am absolutely positive and have every confidence that we will win
the new North Aberdeen seat and although people have been very kind and
said it would be easier to win if I was the candidate, the fact that I
am not going to be the candidate shows how confident I am that the seat
can be won and will be won.
''I have heard several names of people who are interested in
contesting North Aberdeen and I am sure whoever gets it will be a good
MP.''

TWO ships carrying 610 Palestinians expelled nearly two weeks ago from
Libya arrived in Syria today to emotional reunions with relatives who
had waited for hours at the port.
The Defence Ministry vessel, al-Assad, carrying 340 people, many of
them children, arrived a few hours after a first ship, the Fayza
Express, had docked with 270 people.
All had come from Cyprus where they had been held off the coast for
six days aboard a car ferry which brought them from Libya, while
authorities decided where they could go.
The passengers, looking tired but happy to see an end to their wait at
sea, were greeted by officials and some 500 relatives after their
18-hour trip from the Cypriot port of Larnaca.
The fate of 40 other Palestinians without Syrian travel documents, who
remained on board the ferry Countess M off Cyprus, was not clear.
Cypriot authorities were in contact with Jordan to arrange the departure
of 14 Jordanian families. Others had Moroccan or Algerian nationality.
Ibrahim Melhim, manager of the Fayza Express, said that his ship's
trip to Larnaca and all expenses involved in bringing the Palestinians
to Syria were being given free.
''We hope by doing so we did something to our Palestinian brothers,''
he said.
''This is a warm welcome and I am weeping of joy because after all
this time our nightmare has ended,'' said an old man as he disembarked.
The refugees are part of the 30,000-strong Palestinian community in
Libya who have become pawns in Middle East political power games.
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered all Palestinians to leave in
August, ostensibly to expose a peace deal between the PLO and Israel.
Despite the creation of Palestinian autonomous areas, Israel still
controls the borders of Gaza and the West Bank.
Arab countries have refused to take any except those who have travel
documents. Another 1000 refugees languish at a makeshift camp on Libya's
border with Egypt because, like many Palestinians, they are stateless or
lack valid passports.
Syria originally turned back the Countess M when it arrived offshore
last week, forcing it to head for nearby Cyprus where authorities also
refused to allow the passengers to land.
However after days of negotiations, Syria sent the two boats to pick
up most of the stranded Palestinians.--Reuter.

Beijing
CHINA today made a dawn swoop on a luxury hotel for military top
brass, arresting 400 officers from mid to high rank.
It was one of the first signs of a hardening of resolve by officialdom
over who will run the country after Deng Xiaoping dies.
Around 600 police and soldiers surrounded the Mayor's Hotel in a
movement worthy of a battlefield, and left quickly with some of the
cream of the Red Army.
Four civilian buses disgorged soldiers at each corner of the building
while a contingent swarmed in the front.
The street, in the Chinese capital's booming Chaoyang district, was
blocked off as the first officer was unceremoniously raced out of the
hotel flanked by two lower ranks, who gripped his arms tightly and threw
him in to the waiting bus.
What started as a trickle became a torrent of disgraced officialdom.
Many who tried to run were corralled in from hotel gardens, back
courts, and from under parked cars and dragged to the buses as soldiers
shouted: ''Wait -- one more.''
Soon the buses were full but many soldiers were ordered off to have
their seats searched before they were allowed to leave the street.
A helicopter flew overhead broadcasting a comforting message to
residents who could see police searching now-empty hotel rooms.
Onlookers could see abandoned card games, bottles littering the tables,
and satellite TV sets still running.
As dawn broke, the area outside returned to normal and traffic flowed.
Hotel staff were ordered to watch from an assembly point and then
taken for interrogation about life at the army's palace.
Meanwhile, a low rumble of Chinese dissent grew yesterday ahead of a
Sino-US summit.
Chinese President Jiang Jemin and President Bill Clinton are in New
York for celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations
and they were meeting today to try to mend strained relations.
With the summit expected to focus international attention on China's
human rights situation, Chinese dissidents have been taking the risky
step of speaking out publicly against abuses and calling for the release
of prisoners of conscience.
The gamble has apparently backfired for Wang Zhihong, who has met
foreign reporters in a bold campaign for the release of her imprisoned
husband, Chen Ziming.
Police detained Wang after she and her in-laws protested in a Beijing
park to demand parole on medical grounds for Chen.

A YOUTH who assaulted Ayrshire MP Brian Donohoe during a dispute over
a damaged door was fined #750 yesterday for the offence.
Gary Doherty, 19, of Warrix Avenue, Irvine, was also ordered to carry
out 250 hours' community service on an unrelated charge of theft by
housebreaking in Irvine.
Sentence had been deferred on Doherty for background reports after he
had been found guilty in February of assaulting Mr Donohoe by punching
him on the face.
The court was told that Doherty and a friend had gone to the MP's home
to discuss compensation for a cousin's door allegedly damaged during an
incident involving one of Mr Donohoe's sons.
A scuffle followed and Doherty punched Mr Donohoe's face, bruising his
left eye.
Defence agent James Irvine told Kilmarnock Sheriff Court yesterday
that his client was undertaking a course in computing at Kilmarnock
College and had an income of only #73 per fortnight.
Sheriff David Smith -- fining Doherty #750 for the assault charge and
giving him community service for housebreaking -- said: ''You were
teetering on the brink of jail. Your card has been marked and any
sheriff or justice in the district court will be in no doubt as to the
seriousness of these offences.

<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR tonight paved the way for a historic visit to Britain by
Argentine president Carlos Menem.
The Prime Minister invited the Argentine head of state during a
50-minute meeting at the United Nations.
However the two men refused to budge an inch on the explosive question
of which country has sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.
British diplomats said Mr Major was fully aware of the controversy
that could surround a visit 12 years after Britain and Argentina fought
a bloody war over the islands.
But it is understood that Mr Major believes the best way to ensure a
lasting peace is a steady process of confidence-building contacts
between politicians on both sides.
Their meeting at the UN Plaza Hotel was the first between the heads of
Government of the two countries since the Argentine invasion of the
Falklands in 1982.
Officials said the talks were a ''constructive exchange'' held in a
good atmosphere.
The decision to issue the invitation followed a surprise breakthrough
in moves to start official negotiations for a long-term fisheries
agreement around the Falklands.
Last month in New York, Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind signed a
ground-breaking deal to permit exploration for oil in Falklands waters
and an agreement on fish conservation would remove another obstacle to
closer links.
However both sides have agreed to disagree on the issue of
sovereignty. Before today's meeting, the Prime Minister was adamant that
it would not be on the agenda.
''It is a matter which is quite clear as far as we are concerned. It
is British sovereignty and nothing in that is going to change,'' he
said.
''This is part of a steady series of confidence-building measures but
there is no question of discussing the sovereignty of the islands.''
President Menem, who was careful not to refer to the islands by name
at any stage today, nevertheless made it clear that Buenos Aires still
held a claim to them.
''Sovereignty has been placed under an umbrella for the time being,''
he said. ''We will be showing the world that only through negotiation
and talks can one reach a settlement acceptable to everyone.''
The invitation to visit will be formalised only if progress continues
to be made on the fisheries agreement.
President Menem said he hoped a deal could be struck by the turn of
the year.
One senior aide said: ''What people would like to see is British
sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and the self-determination of the
Falkland Islanders preserved and guaranteed in an environment where the
threat of war or invasion by Argentina is removed.
''By this steady process these are the objectives the Prime Minister
is seeking to achieve so that we will not find ourselves in a situation
again in which people lose their lives.''

ROVER cars yesterday announced plans to develop the former Leyland
truck site in Bathgate.
The multi-million pound plan for the 100-acre site is backed by the
British Airports Authority and McArthur/Glen UK Ltd.
It would create a retail, housing, and commercial complex around a
factory shopping village.
A spokesman for property advisers Montagu Evans, said: ''Rover is in
the process of formulating a master plan for the whole site.''
An application for outline planning permission has been lodged with
West Lothian District Council.
The proposals include a 110,000sq ft shopping development, a bowling
alley and cinema, and a 150,000sq ft retail warehouse park.
The Leyland truck factory employed 6000 people until it closed in
1986. The factory was later demolished, since when the site has been
used as a car compound.
A #100m scheme to turn the site into a Disneyland-style theme park
collapsed in 1988.
West Lothian District Council has already received plans for a
50,000sq ft retail and leisure complex at Westwood, West Calder, and an
110,000sq ft shopping development at Pottishaw, Bathgate.

THE Government pill warning has brought to light at least 100 new
cases of women who claim to have suffered serious illness after taking
one of the contraceptives, it emerged yesterday.
Lawyers preparing a test case involving two brands of the pills said
they had been flooded with calls since the alert.
Prior to the warning, 200 women had joined in the legal claim. The
number has now swollen to 300 and the solicitors expect to hear from
more.
All the new cases involve women who have suffered deep- vein
thrombosis or a blood clot in the lung after using one of the seven
third-generation pills at the centre of the scare.
The news emerged as Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell was making a
statement to the Commons about the affair.
He said methods of alerting GPs to key health developments were to be
reviewed after complaints over the way last week's warning was handled.
Mr Dorrell defended the actions he and his department had taken but
admitted they had not been ideal in allowing them properly to advise
patients.
He accused Labour and others of trying to make political capital out
of something that was not a party-political issue and detailed the steps
that had been taken.
The Health Secretary reiterated that the increased risk of thrombosis
from taking the seven relevant brands of pill remained roughly half the
risk associated with pregnancy. He also said women taking one of the
seven relevant brands should continue to do so until they had seen their
GP or family doctor.
Faced with charges of ''complacency and incompetence'' from Shadow
Health Secretary Harriet Harman, Mr Dorrell told the Commons: ''You say
that not every GP knew at the ideal moment in order to give advice to
their patients.
''I concede that that is true and of course I recognise that after any
incident of this kind we need to ensure that the arrangements are
reviewed in order to learn any lessons available to be learned.''
The pill brands at the centre of the controversy are Femodene,
Femodene ED, Minulet, Triadene, Tri-Minulet, Marvelon, and Mercilon.
They were hailed as a new safer generation of oral contraceptive when
introduced in the past decade. However, on Thursday, the Government's
Committee on Safety of Medicines issued a warning that women on the
pills were twice as likely to suffer deep-vein thrombosis as users of
other oral contraceptives.
The alert sparked a huge row with the Government being accused of
acting hastily and causing unnecessary panic and GPs complaining they
were not notified properly of the warning.
Two firms of solicitors, Carvers and Lewis &amp; Tompkins, joined forces
last August to co-ordinate claims against the makers of Femodene and
Minulet.
The lawyers will be seeking compensation for women who say they have
suffered serious ill effects from the pills.

DOUNREAY's most faithful supporter, Caithness District Council,
yesterday avoided endorsing the nuclear plant's intention of seeking
contracts for reprocessing of spent fuel from research reactors
world-wide.
The spent fuel rods were originally to have been returned to their
country of origin, the US, but opposition has been growing there and
reprocessing at Dounreay is an option now being considered by the US
Department of the Environment.
The operators of the research reactors are facing an acute storage
problem and are desperate to find a solution or some might face closure.
Caithness councillors, meeting in Wick, yesterday sidestepped a move
to throw their weight behind the foreign reprocessing and contented
themselves with unanimously restating their general support for
Dounreay.
One councillor, the Rev Alistair Roy, had taken exception to a recent
editorial in The Herald which had compared reprocessing to pouring
petrol on a bonfire. ''That is a complete misrepresentation of what is
going on,'' Mr Roy said.
''We are not blind to the fact that mistakes can be made from time to
time but it's an industry we support and we should reinforce our support
to the management and workforce in the work they are doing.''
However, Councillor Billy Mowat, a former Dounreay employee, said he
was not prepared to give Dounreay ''a pat on the back''. Issues raised
by opponents of the plant were now gaining wider credence and he was
particularly concerned that the Dounreay workforce had not been
consulted on the bid to win foreign reprocessing contracts.
Convener John Young was supported in his suggestion that the council
simply register its continuing general support for Dounreay.
Highland Regional Council, meanwhile, is seeking counsel's opinion as
to whether the consents granted to the Atomic Energy Authority in the
1950s by the old Caithness County Council are sufficient to cover the
importation of nuclear fuel for reprocessing.
Earlier this month, 52 rods from the Hann Meitner Institute in Berlin
were shipped to Scrabster for reprocessing at Dounreay, but there are up
to 15,000 still stockpiled at reactors.
Anti-nuclear campaigners throughout Europe intend to fight Dounreay's
attempt to get the spent fuel, which they describe as a radioactive
cocktail of weapons-grade material, sent to Caithness for reprocessing.
Such business would serve to offset some of the heavy costs of
decommissioning work at the plant.

THE brother of a man who jumped off the Erskine bridge shortly after
he was given the controversial electro-convulsive therapy yesterday
demanded better protection for depressive patients.
Mr Alex Doherty was speaking at a seminar in Edinburgh run by the
Scottish Association for Mental Health. He called for changes in the law
affecting consent to give electric shock treatment.
Mr Doherty claimed to have the support of almost every local authority
and the vast majority of mental health organisations for a campaign he
launched after 30-year-old Joseph Doherty committed suicide while a
patient at Gartnavel Royal Hospital, Glasgow, three years ago.
A fatal accident inquiry failed to find any fault with the hospital
but Mr Doherty, from the Clydebank area, maintains that his brother was
not fit to consent to ECT and had refused on numerous occasions.
Yesterday, he told the seminar in Edinburgh there had to be more
research done on the effectiveness of the treatment: ''There are a lot
of Joseph Doherty's out there and there has to be stricter controls.''
Mr Robin Laing, director of the Scottish Association for Mental
Health, said there had been a mobilisation of the anti-ECT lobby in the
last five years but there was evidence of the establishment fighting
back. There was a need to ''toughen up'' controls.
''It really is time to stop psychiatrists and hospitals from going
their own sweet way,'' Mr Laing said.
He felt there had to be a second opinion sought in every case where
the use of ECT was being considered.
Dr Margaret Thomas, of Lanarkshire, chair of the Manic Depression
Fellowship Scotland, said there was a lack of balanced information about
the uses of ECT.
She believed its use should be decreasing and voiced concern that such
treatment was going to be used as a cheap alternative to good medical
and nursing care.
Dr Chris Freeman, consultant psychiatrist at the Royal Edinburgh
Hospital and chairman of a Scottish Office inquiry into ECT, felt there
should be a national study of use of ECT.

GOVERNMENT scientists are investigating the possibility that another
cattle farmer has contracted the human equivalent of mad cow disease, it
emerged yesterday.
If it is confirmed that the farmer has Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease it
will heighten concern over whether the infection can cross over from
cattle to humans through meat or milk.
However, the disease cannot be diagnosed by tests until a victim dies.
According to a newspaper report yesterday, the man, understood to come
from North Wales, has a case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy -- mad
cow disease -- among his herd.
Three previous cattle farmers with infected animals in their herds
have died from CJD in the past two years.
If a fourth dies, it would make the rate of CJD incidence among cattle
farmers much higher than the average for the whole population.
A Department of Health spokesman said yesterday the Government was
aware of the latest suspected case.
''The necessary investigations are under way,'' he added.
The new alert came to light after the leaked news that a Government
BSE advisory committee had reviewed the latest incident against the
background of the three cases already confirmed.
The leaked statement from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee, disclosed in a newspaper yesterday, said it is difficult to
explain the number of cattle farmer CJD deaths as ''simply a chance
phenomenon''.
However, it points out there might be other explanations for such an
association besides BSE infection.

A FAMILY were shaken but unhurt when their house was blown up by a
stereo player and a #1.15 can of deodorant.
Peter and Glynis Deeks and their four children had just been watching
a TV film about the ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission, which almost ended
in tragedy after a gas blast, when their house was shaken by a huge
explosion caused by an aerosol can of anti-perspirant becoming heated by
a portable cassette radio.
Part of the #85,000 family home in Chippenham, Wiltshire, will have to
be demolished after the blast buckled a rear wall.
The Sunday afternoon blast blew out windows and doors, and the roof
actually lifted off but settled back. Shards of glass were blown 60
yards down the road.

AN American who claimed he was turned down for an announcer's job with
BBC Scotland because of his accent has had his race discrimination case
rejected by a Glasgow industrial tribunal.
The BBC denied racial discrimination, claiming the applicant, Mr Paul
Vizzini, did not have the necessary talent and qualities required for
the job.
The tribunal heard earlier that more than 100 applicants had sent in
demo tapes when three announcers' jobs were advertised. Mr Vizzini's was
among a large pile placed in the ''definitely not'' category. Of the 11
possibles, only five had Scottish accents.
The BBC were looking for a good tone of voice, articulation skills,
microphone quality, versatility, intelligence, and authority.
Mr Ian Aldred, senior presentation announcer who vetted the tapes,
regarded Mr Vizzini as having no aptitude at all. He said he looked for
the best broadcaster, irrespective of anything such as accent. The BBC
did not employ just Scottish people.
If two candidates were of equal value and ability and one had a
Scottish accent, then it would be possible that the one with the
Scottish accent would be accepted, he said. However he could not recall
any incident requiring such a decision.
Mr Aldred and Mr Peter Gourd, head of presentation, selected three
candidates, two with Scottish accents. The third was described as
mid-Atlantic, largely attributable to his previous employment as a disc
jockey in independent radio. He had an enthusiastic brightness of
delivery and was eager to learn.
Mr Aldred and Mr Gourd strenuously denied that having a Scottish
accent was a requirement for the job.
Mr Aldred wrote to Mr Vizzini when the applicant asked why he had been
unsuccessful. ''There are subordinate reasons, such as Radio Scotland's
preference for Scottish accents, since our department, to a large
extent, represents the station,'' Mr Aldred wrote. ''You also tend to
articulate a sharp sibilant S.
''But by far the main reason was that you read with no authority. If
you listen to your tape again, Paul, I think you will agree that your
delivery was extremely hesitant, leading the listener to feel this is
news to you as well as to him.
''I'm sorry I can't be more encouraging but I honestly feel you have a
huge hurdle ahead of you if you choose to pursue this kind of work.''
Mr Vizzini wrote back to Mr Aldred, asking him to elaborate on the
preference for Scottish accents.
Mr Aldred replied: ''Radio Scotland uses a wide range of accents but
since the presentation department is largely the voice of the station
and since we already have several non-Scottish accents, we're trying to
keep a balance, so in our recent search we were hoping to find someone
with the right experience and attitude, and a Scottish accent.
''Sometimes we have to compromise but in this occasion we found
suitable candidates.
''I did indicate, however, that your accent was not the only hurdle
you would face.''
Mr Vizzini, of East Bowhouse Head, Irvine, failed to turn up for his
tribunal hearing in August this year but his written representations
were taken into account.
It was the unanimous opinion of the tribunal that the rejection of Mr
Vizzini's tape was entirely due to his lack of aptitude and for no other
reason.
The tribunal were not convinced that an accent of itself was a matter
of race as defined in the said Act. ''Within the broadcasting media,
there are many employees whose accents would not give any indication as
to their race, nationality or ethnic or national origins,'' the tribunal
said. ''The possession of an accent is something which can be
acquired.''
The tribunal said it did not seem unreasonable for the BBC to seek to
maintain a balance of Scottish accents in a broadcasting facility
directly relating to Scotland. They had received a substantial amount of
complaints about accents and pronunciation.
It was only reasonable that they had regard to the impact accents had
on their listeners, it said.
This was not an attempt to impose a quota based on race, the tribunal
added, and ruled there was no racial discrimination.

A MAN died instantly from a freak injury which resulted in a brain
haemorrhage but did not even leave a bruise, a judge was told yesterday.
Patrick O'Connor, 40, was killed by a single, relatively light blow to
an area behind his ear.
The man who landed the blow, Scott Meikle, 34, was yesterday jailed
for 30 months at the High Court in Edinburgh after admitting the
culpable homicide of Mr O'Connor.
Advocate-depute Paul McBride said Meikle, of Royston Mains Green,
Edinburgh, and members of his family had spent the evening of July 1
this year at the Granary hotel in Ferry Road.
A female cousin became involved in an altercation with Mr O'Connor's
girlfriend, the court heard.
Meikle and his brother, George, 30, of Fort House, Leith, chased Mr
O'Connor after he and his girlfriend left the hotel.
George Meikle pushed him to the ground and Scott kicked him once on
the side of the head.
Mr O'Connor, of Citadel Court, Edinburgh, was dead on arrival at
hospital and tests showed he had suffered from a brain haemorrhage as a
result of the blow to the head.
He had been struck just behind the ear.
Mr Derek Ogg, counsel for Scott Meikle, said the incident amounted to
a scuffle of the type which could be seen up and down the country on any
Saturday night.
After George Meikle pushed Mr O'Connor down, the victim was trying to
get up and put an arm around Scott Meikle's leg, Mr Ogg said.
''He waved his leg back and delivered a light kick to his face,'' he
said.
''It was not an aimed kick and it happened to hit him on a tiny spot
behind the ear.''
Mr Ogg said the injury was something of a freak, causing the man's
death but not even leaving a bruise.
There was no evidence of any beating or savage kicking and onlookers
had gone back into the hotel thinking that Mr O'Connor would get up and
go off with his girlfriend.
Mr Edgar Prais, QC, for George Meikle, said the brothers had spent 72
days in custody before the murder charge was reduced to culpable
homicide and they were granted bail.
George's total involvement had been to push the victim with his open
hand, Mr Prais said.
Lord Osborne described the case as a ''tragic affair''.
He told Scott Meikle he had to take into account that his single kick
to the head had caused Mr O'Connor's death.
However, it had been a light blow and Meikle had not intended any
significant harm, Lord Osborne said.
A jail sentence had to be imposed to mark the court's disapprovalbut
Lord Osborne said he felt that, in the circumstances, he could restrict
the sentence to one of 30 months.
He said he felt George Meikle had been punished enough by spending 72
days in custody on a charge of murder, and admonished him.

THE island of Scalpay in the Western Isles was on pollution alert last
night as leaking fuel from a wrecked coaster threatened to wipe out fish
farms.
Bad weather is hampering attempts to drag the Antigua-registered
2000-tonne coaster Golf Star off rocks in the south of the island, off
Harris.
A coastguard spokesman said: ''We know there are about 45 tonnes of
diesel fuel still on the vessel.''
The Golf Star ran aground on Scalpay in the early hours of Friday
morning.
Western Isles Islands Council's emergency planning officers were
yesterday monitoring the slick which the bad weather was helping

POLICE yesterday had to wait for 15 people arrested after an
eight-hour armed pub siege to sober up before asking them about a
robbery.
Armed police surrounded the Ship in the Hole at Wallsend, Tyne and
Wear, at 6pm on Sunday after a tip-off about a robbery nearby.
About 15 drinkers left at that stage but the remainder stayed inside.
The 40-strong police team waited outside the locked premises.
The stand-off ended early yesterday and resulted in the arrest of 12
men and three women who needed to sleep off the effects of a night's
drinking.
A police spokesman said that, so far, they had no information to
confirm that a robbery actually occurred.

POLICE hunting the killer of Naomi Smith will DNA test up to 800 males
in the Ansley Common area, near Nuneaton, Warwickshire.
Naomi, 15, was found stabbed 200 yards from her home at Bretts Hall
estate, Ansley Common, on September 14.
Detectives, using a forensic psychologist, have drawn up a DNA profile
of a man they believe could be responsible for her murder. They will
begin the voluntary testing of 15 to 28-year- olds today, and expect the
programme to take several weeks.
Detective Superintendent Tony Bayliss, who is leading the
investigation, said: ''It is now a question of when and not if we catch
this offender.
''This testing may provoke some unusual behaviour, someone leaving the
area unexpectedly. We will be watching for that.''
Police have no power to enforce the testing but can take samples from
suspects they arrest on suspicion.
A team of 20 officers will start calling at the homes of all the young
men in the area today. Testing will be done using mouth swabs.
Every house in Ansley Common has been visited as police continue their
investigation. More than 1800 people have been interviewed.
Police believe the killer must have known Naomi, or known the area --
particularly the playground where she was found -- very well.

AFTER police revealed her husband had admitted killing their eldest
daughter, Rosemary West said he was a ''dead man'' if she laid hands on
him.
In a taped police interview played in Court 3 of Winchester Crown
Court yesterday, Mrs West could be heard vowing vengeance on husband
Frederick West for admitting that he killed their daughter Heather.
Earlier, there was shock in Mrs West's voice when told by police that
Fred West had confessed to murdering Heather, who disappeared when she
was 16.
''What? So you know where she is?'' the jury heard Mrs West say as she
broke down in tears: ''So she's dead? Is that right?''
Detective Sergeant Terry Onions, of Gloucester Police, said: ''I'm
telling you Fred has confessed to murdering Heather and that
automatically implicates you.''
Mrs West: ''It's a lie.''
The interview took place on the day digging began in the garden of 25
Cromwell Street..
The evening before, Mrs West had also been interviewed by police in
her home. During this interview, she admitted she knew of a family
rumour that Heather had been buried under the patio.
Although she was told that a large number of police officers would
begin digging in the garden the next day, she denied all knowledge of
Heather's whereabouts. She repeatedly swore and shouted at police and
accused them of incompetence in the search for her daughter.
When she was arrested the following day and taken to Cheltenham Police
Station she was more subdued.
She was interviewed again that evening at Gloucester Police Station
and when told of her husband's murder confession she was tearful and
contrite but insisted she was innocent.
Mrs West denies murdering 10 young girls and women. The jury was told
that the tapes of the interviews were being played at the request of Mr
Richard Ferguson QC, defending.
In the first taped interview in her home, Mrs West described how
Heather had left home while she was out shopping. Previously, she had
given her husband #600 which was intended for Heather, who had made it
clear she wanted to leave home.
Mrs West said that, as far as she knew, Heather was a lesbian and, as
a mother, she had to think of the other children in the family.
''She said if a boy touched me I would put a brick over his f***ing
head,'' Mrs West told the police.
Asked how she knew Heather was a lesbian, Mrs West said in the taped
interview: ''When she was little in the infant school she knew exactly
what kind of knickers the women teachers had on . . .''
When police said they were merely attempting to discover Heather's
whereabouts, Mrs West responded: ''If you had any brains at all you can
find her . . . It can't be that bloody difficult.''
Mr Onions was then heard saying: ''Tomorrow there will be a lot of
officers out there digging. If you can possibly point in any direction
as to where she is, even if it's . . . better for you to tell us.'' Mrs
West insisted she did not know.
Asked why she had not reported Heather's disappearance to the police,
Mrs West responded: ''So I have to snitch on my own daughter now, do
I?''
The family story that Heather was buried under the patio had come,
said Mrs West, from her daughter Anne Marie. The officer said: ''We are
going to dig up the patio and . . .'' Mrs West interrupted: ''I ain't
got nothing to worry about.''
Asked by Mr Onions if she still thought Heather was alive, Mrs West
replied: ''Well why not? Not unless something horrible has happened to
her.''
The officer told her he had a strong feeling that Heather had been
dead for a long, long time. ''Oh, you're lovely aren't you?'' replied
Mrs West.
Next day, Frederick West was arrested and some time later so was Mrs
West. Mr Onions later asked Mrs West why she thought she had been
arrested. She replied: ''That's what I'm hoping to find out, I don't
know!''
It was at this stage the officer told Mrs West that her husband had
confessed to murdering Heather.
The third interview was conducted at Gloucester Police Station on the
evening of February 25 last year. Asked about any conversation she had
with her husband before his arrest she said she was surprised as he had
made a ''prison lighter'' which involved a wick in a little tin.
Asked whether she had been naive over the eight-year disappearance of
her daughter, Mrs West replied: ''Looks like it, don't it?''
She was asked about implements that went with a freezer in the house.
Mrs West said at one time there was a freezer knife, used to cut up
frozen meat and that sort of thing.
A sharp knife, with an 8in blade, said to have been recovered with the
remains of victim Lucy Partington, was passed around the jury.
Mrs West could not remember a fresh hole being dug in the garden
immediately after Heather's disappearance nor could she explain her
husband fantasising about seeing Heather at various times after she
disappeared.
Asked who was the dominant partner, Mrs West said: ''I'd say Fred was
really, in lots of ways.'' She denied in the taped interview she had
been involved in the disposal of Heather.
The officer put it to her she was blind, extremely naive, totally
trusting of her husband or a total liar. ''Or I was sent out,'' said Mrs
West.
Asked what were her feelings towards her husband now that she knew he
had admitted killing Heather, Mrs West said: ''Put it this way, he's a
dead man if ever I get my hands on him.''
Frederick West committed suicide on New Year's Day while on remand
charged with 12 counts of murder.
Earlier, the court was told that a police investigation in 1992 had
uncovered from the West house numerous home-made and commercial
pornographic videos, sex aids, rubber clothing, and whips.
One of the commercial videos showed a young woman being suspended from
a beam in a cellar, being whipped by two men and subjected to other
sexual indignities.
The jury were then shown sections of a beam cut from the ceiling from
the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street. Each of the sections had a hole
drilled in it.
The trial continues.

A BUSINESSMAN is believed to have fallen to his death on a rocky
hillside after running off concussed and disorientated from the scene of
an accident on a country road 800ft below.
Mr Robert Crawford, 45, refused medical help and ran off after
crashing his Porsche 944 on the twisting B829 at Loch Ard, Perthshire,
on Sunday morning.
Mountain rescuers found him dead at the foot of a treacherous slope
high on the hill two-and-a-half hours later.
Inspector Bill Rose at Callander said: ''He was found on the hillside
on steep and treacherous ground in circumstances that suggest he had
fallen.''
It is not known whether the injuries which caused Mr Crawford's death
were suffered in the crash or in the fall.
There is no suggestion that he had been drinking, or was trying for
any reason to avoid the police.
A post-mortem examination is being carried out at Stirling Royal
Infirmary. Results should be available today.
Mr Crawford, of Cadzow Street, Hamilton, was a married man with
children. He ran a fitness equipment shop at Charing Cross, Glasgow.
Police said his wife and family were in a state of shock.
His badly damaged F-registration Porsche 944 was taken to Stirling,
where it was being examined for indications about the cause of the
crash.
He was on his way to go windsurfing when his car left the road,
crashed through a wall, and plunged down an embankment.
Guest house proprietor Andrew Carter, who was first on the scene, said
yesterday: ''We heard a very loud explosion about five past ten on
Sunday morning.
''My son Graham and I ran down the drive to see what had happened and
saw this man running away from the scene of the accident.
''We found the Porsche and called out to see if there was anyone else
inside, and looked around to see if anybody had been thrown out.
''We couldn't see anything for all the broken rhododendron bushes.
''Just then the local policeman, Stuart Kerr, came up the loch in a
canoe.
''Suddenly we heard a loud splash and a cry from down by the river
bridge where the loch turns into the baby Forth.
''Stuart and myself ran down to the bridge and found the driver
climbing out of the river.
''Stuart went and calmed him and brought him across the bridge.
''He was badly cut, but walking quite well. My wife appeared and took
him up to the house.
''We sat him down in the kitchen to wait for the ambulance. Then he
said he wanted to go to the loo.
''He ran off, and we found him in the dining room.
''We sat him down again, but then he asked to go to the loo again and
ran off out of the house.
''He was very athletic, and went like the wind. There was nothing we
could do to stop him.''
Mr Carter, of Craigard House, by Kinlochard, added: ''He had obviously
been concussed. He was shaken and disoriented and we couldn't keep him
still.''
Police and 20 members of Lomond Mountain Rescue Team, who were on
exercise in the area, began scouring the hill and found Mr Crawford dead
just before 1pm.
The fitness fanatic lived at a luxury flat in Hamilton with beautician
Helena, 41, his second wife. They moved to Lanarkshire from Edinburgh 10
years ago.
Helena and the couple's son Aidan, six, were being comforted by
relatives on the east coast last night.

A DRUNKEN police officer offered to drop drugs charges against a woman
in return for sexual favours, a court heard yesterday.
The woman told the court that Constable Ian Gibson, 31, assaulted her
and asked if she had indulged in oral sex or worn handcuffs when he
returned alone to her house after a police drugs raid.
Mr Gibson is accused of having lied to a Justice of the Peace to
obtain a search warrant and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
He is also charged with being concerned in the supply of cannabis,
assaulting Miss Karen McNally, 35, and committing a breach of the peace
in her home by making indecent comments towards her in November last
year.
The police officer denies all charges.
Earlier, Mr Gibson and three other officers had gone to Miss McNally's
house and seized a small amount of cannabis.
Miss McNally told Dundee Sheriff Court that Mr Gibson returned to her
multi-storey flat on his own, late at night, four days later.
She described his condition as ''drunk'' and added: ''I smelled drink
off his breath''.
The court heard that Mr Gibson came into her house at 11.15pm and,
after putting his police radio on a table, sat down beside her on a
settee.
Miss McNally said Mr Gibson asked if they could ''come to some
arrangement'' about the cannabis and then began touching her.
Miss McNally said Mr Gibson told her he ''didn't want to charge'' her.
She said: ''At one point, he said, 'I'll give you your cannabis back,'
and I said, 'What happens when it comes to court?'.
''He said, 'I'll lie, like I did to get the warrant'.''
Miss McNally said the police officer began to massage her back and
neck.
''He said, 'I could give you money if that's what you want'.''
Miss McNally said Mr Gibson grabbed both her wrists and asked her to
''put up a bit of a fight''.
She said he also put his thumbs down the back of her jeans and moved
his hand up her thigh during his 90-minute stay.
The trial, before Sheriff Alexander Eccles, continues.

THE husband of lost climber
Alison Hargreaves has been offered a job in the country where she fell
to her death.
Mr Jim Ballard, 49, has been asked by Government officials in Pakistan
to advise them on green tourism. The offer came during a trip to the
spot where his 33-year-old wife died in August on her descent of K2, the
world's most dangerous mountain.
Last week, he stood with children Tom, six, and four-year-old Kate in
the foothills of the Himalayas and viewed the peak where their mother's
body lies unrecovered.
Back home, Mr Ballard said yesterday: ''Now I have six weeks to
complete a book about the tragedy. And next summer I intend to go back
to Pakistan as an adviser.
''The offer to work there is a great compliment. There is no doubt the
Government takes the subject of green tourism very seriously.''
During his trip, Mr Ballard had lengthy talks with the directors of
the National Tourist Board and Ministry of Information.
''My concept of the ideal green tourism is something like the islands
of Skye, Eigg, and Rhum, where there is serenity you can't
manufacture,'' he added.
''Places of beauty must be given maximum protection. For instance, you
can't stick Disneyland halfway up the Great Glen.''

A CONSULTATION document about the welfare of animals transported for
sale is to be published by the Government, the Scottish Agriculture
Minister, Lord Lindsay, said yesterday.
He said on a visit to the Perth bull sales that the consultation would
examine issues such as maximum journey limits, feeding, watering, rest
intervals, and improved enforcement mechanisms.
A new licensing scheme for animal transporters and competence
requirements for hauliers and handlers will also be examined in the
review.
The consultation follows an agreement reached over the protection of
animals by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers in June. The new
rules must be implemented by the end of next year.
Lord Lindsay described the European agreement as ''a great
breakthrough for the welfare of animals -- right across the community''.
It was important to ensure the new rules were translated into workable
and effective measures on the ground.
He added: ''The consultation document sets out our ideas and I hope
that it will set the scene for constructive discussions over the coming
months with all those who will be affected. It is important that they
take this opportunity to let us know what they think.''
Agriculture departments throughout Britain have written to interested
organisations inviting them to express their views by December 15.
Meanwhile, the RSPCA yesterday welcomed a #10,000 fine on a
Dutch-based animal exporter, Nicolay BV, after 249 calves were
transported in temperatures of up to 27C over two days from Eire to
Barcelona, by road and sea, via Kent, with only a 90-minute stop.
Dover Magistrates' Court heard that the company felt a ''sense of
shame'' over the case, which was described as ''a one-off''. It happened
in June last year.
Fining the firm #9960 and imposing costs of #910, bench chairman
Audrey Laughlin said: ''We feel this fine reflects the company's
acceptance of responsibility in this matter.''
However, animal rights protesters described the fine as derisory and
claimed that it amounted to less than #1 per calf for each hour they
were in transit.

<HEADLINE>Group challenges tartan society</HEADLINE>

A BREAKAWAY group emerged yesterday to challenge the fiefdom of the
Scottish Tartan Society -- keeper of all things tartan for the past 30
years.
The society was forced by cash problems to close the Scottish Tartan
Museum in Comrie, Perthshire, two years ago.
Yesterday, the Scottish Tartans Authority was launched at two press
conferences at the Highland Trade Fair, Aviemore, and the Stone Mountain
Highland Games in Georgia, USA.
The new body -- backed by the grandly-named Tartan Education and
Cultural Association in America -- accused the Pitlochry-based society
of ''maladministration and years of neglect.''
The director of the new body, Mr J Alisdair Buchan, of Borders-based
Lochcarron Weavers, said: ''This was the last resort. We gave the
society all the chances. We must move forward.''
Mr Buchan claimed that many top members in America had decided to stop
their subscriptions to the society.
The remaining individual members of the society, around 100, were
advised yesterday to quit and support the new body.
Another director of the breakaway group, Mr Blair MacNaughton, of the
House of Edgar at Pitlochry, said: ''The society has been badly
administered for 15 years . . . yet staff have sent out letters to
members suggesting that all is well. It is not.''
He claimed the Government's charities watchdog in Scotland had
expressed the hope that the society would be able to reform itself but
this had not happened.
The new body says it is planning a #1.4m International Tartan Centre,
''close to a main centre of population in Scotland'', for which it would
be seeking public sector support.
Yesterday, Mr Keith Lumsden, of the Scottish Tartan Society, in
Pitlochry, said the new breakaway body was backed by a number of
prominent weavers and retailers in the industry.
He added that the society, a non-profit-making body, had first mooted
an international tartan centre around eight years ago but had not been
able to raise the finance.
He continued: ''If the commercial powers-that-be in the industry want
to set up a major tartan centre then that can only be for the good,
because it will increase the profile of tartan and that is something we
all want to see''.

EXCLUSIVE
A REGION'S councillors have avoided a suggestion that a religious test
be applied to parents making placing requests to favoured Roman Catholic
schools, by passing it on to the unitary authorities.
Alarmed at the potentially explosive consequences of an additional,
''Are you a Catholic?'' question on the placement application form,
Labour Strathclyde councillors meeting in private yesterday dispatched
the problem in the direction of the new councils, which take over next
April.
Education chairman, Councillor Tom Farrell, said: ''We felt it would
be wise to leave this matter to the new authorities. It was just a
discussion we had today.''
A paper from the director of education, Mr Frank Pignatelli, raised
the possibility of a religious test being added to the criteria for
deciding between placing requests. In other words, if it were a magnet
Catholic school, such as Holyrood Secondary, parents would be asked if
their child was Catholic, which would be an additional criterion to be
considered by the admission panel.
Anxious parents previously have raised the issue with councillors,
arguing that while they as Catholics were unable to get their children
admitted to Holyrood, many non-Catholics, including Muslims, had been
able to get places.
However, this proposal would apply only to placement requests from
people outwith the catchment area and was not designed to discriminate
against non-Catholics within the area.
Councillors were advised that for some time the Catholic Church had
been pursuing the issue of whether or not it would be possible to
include a further criterion giving preference to Catholic children in
cases where the choice has to be made among those making placing
requests to a Roman Catholic school.
The Church had no wish to see such a criterion taking precedence over
the other general criteria but felt the suggestion was entirely in
keeping with the spirit of the legislation relating to denominational
schools.
However, it was also clear that if the council applied that additional
criterion, it would also have to apply it to non-denominational schools
which were oversubscribed, like Lenzie Academy, which had many Catholic
pupils.
Dr Malcolm Green, chairman of the education committee of the new
Glasgow unitary authority, said: ''We're not talking about youngsters
not being able to get a Catholic education, we're talking about
youngsters who don't want to go to their local Catholic school but want
to go to another Catholic school.
''There are other ways of resolving this problem. We shall have to
have a look at situations where schools are over-subscribed,
particularly Holyrood RC secondary.''

<HEADLINE>Golfer set to start new life in US with 20-year-old student after #7.5m divorce settlement. Faldo splits from wife number two</HEADLINE>

NICK Faldo and his wife Gill have split up after nearly 10 years of
marriage, with reports of a #7.5m settlement.
There had been speculation that Faldo, one of the world's leading
golfers, was to end his marriage, his second, after being linked with a
20-year-old American student golfer.
It had been reported that he had consulted his lawyers about a divorce
settlement on the eve of flying out to play in the Ryder Cup in the US.
Faldo, five times a major championship winner, was said yesterday to
have offered his wife a settlement which would give her a #4m one-off
payment and the couple's #3m mansion near Wentworth golf club. She would
also receive a pension of #500,000 for her work as director of Nick
Faldo International and custody of the couple's children: Natalie, nine,
Matthew, six, and two-year-old Georgia.
According to reports, Faldo, three times winner of the Open
championship and twice US Masters champion, wants to start a new life in
the US with Brenna Cepelak.
A brief statement from his agent said: ''With regret, Gill and Nick
today, Monday 23rd of October at 3pm, announced they have split after
nearly 10 years of marriage. Gill and Nick request privacy to
themselves, their family, and friends. There will be no further
statement.''
It was also revealed yesterday that Mrs Faldo asked her friends to
play detective for her. One said: ''Gill thought something was going on
and asked all her close friends to listen out for any gossip they might
pick up about her husband.''
Faldo has played his golf for the past season mainly on the US PGA
tour. The reported settlement is said to give him the couple's Florida
home, currently in his wife's name, and the freedom to move to the US.
She would also resign as his business partner and give up any control
she has in their firms. Faldo would keep all future income from golf
winnings, his four companies, their #375,000 Swiss chalet, and a golf
course he owns.
The golfer was said to have met Cepelak in January when she was
competing in Arizona.
The 20-year-old, who is on a scholarship at the University of Arizona,
is said to have become ''besotted'' with Faldo.
The pair are reported to have met frequently at US tournaments.
She was Albuquerque champion in 1992 when just 17.
A hand-writing expert once examined something Faldo had penned and
reported he showed ''a tendency to loneliness'', was
''strongly-egotistic'' and had ''a great desire to achieve greatness''.
An only child, Faldo turned from cycling to golf after watching Jack
Nicklaus win the US Masters in 1972.
He became English amateur champion at the age of 18 and two years
later was the youngest player to play in the Ryder Cup.
Faldo married a sports journalist, Melanie Rockall, when he was 21,
but soon discovered they were total opposites.
''We were very happily married for eight months,'' he was quoted as
saying in an interview with America's Sports Illustrated magazine.
''Unfortunately, we were married for four and a half years.''
Eventually it emerged, while he was in Hawaii, that he was seeing Gill
Bennett, secretary to his manager, Mr Simpson. Divorce followed and then
he married Gill. There were no children from the first marriage.
Only a year after that second wedding Faldo finally achieved what he
had set his heart on right from the start of his golf career, a major
championship.
It came in the Open at Muirfield, and has since been followed by four
others -- two more Opens at St Andrews in 1990 and back at Muirfield in
1992 and successive victories in the US Masters in 1989 and 1990. Only
Nicklaus had done that before him.
He was the undisputed world No 1 at the start of the 1990s, with a
string of lucrative sponsorship contracts.
Late last year, Faldo announced he was switching from the European to
the American tour and setting up base at Lake Nona in Florida,
headquarters of his coach David Leadbetter.
It was a move, he said, which he hoped would lead to more majors and
he was aware of the sacrifices it meant in terms of time with his
family.
News of his marriage problems broke on the eve of the Ryder Cup in
September. He was in America and his wife was at their Surrey home when
the story broke, but she flew to Rochester, New York, danced with him at
the official gala dinner and was there watching when he helped Europe
win back the trophy by beating Curtis Strange on the very last green.
He has played only three tournaments in Europe this season and has
already committed himself to the US Tour next year.

THE leader of a new unitary authority at the centre of a protest over
allowances said yesterday that his three Labour colleagues were worth
every penny of their #12,000-a-year pay rises.
Leader of the South Lanarkshire Labour group, Mr Tom McCabe, said a
campaign of disinformation was under way, part of a Tory plan to smear
his administration.
He was speaking for the first time after local Tories condemned the
salary levels paid to the three -- all agreed by the council in August.
Councillor McCabe said: ''The payments to the Labour Whip, his deputy,
and our group secretary are all in line with Government policy and Cosla
guidelines.
''The councillors' pay is justified because they will be working at
least three full days a week on committees and that doesn't include
sub-committees. They will be at the council for many hours a day. They
are not just there to see that our group members toe the party line.
''There are 101 other factors of their work in an authority which for
the first time will provide all the services of both region and
district.
''This is not a small-time business. We need people who are prepared
to work virtually full time, and that's why they are worth every
penny.''
He singled out Hamilton district's Tory member Mrs Margaret Mitchell
as a Michael Forsyth acolyte who was jumping on a bandwagon of
disinformation about the #12,000-a-year payments.
''She has been selected as a parliamentary candidate and it's her
style to act in this way,'' he said.
''She failed to get a seat on South Lanarkshire and all she can do is
have a go at us. She forgets it was her party that set up the new
authority and now she is critical of it.''
On South Lanarkshire Labour has a total of 62 out of the 74 seats.
Last night one of the political appointees, Councillor Stuart
McQuarrie, 42, hit back at the Conservative criticism.
He said: ''We three will be working a great deal on the unitary
authority -- not just to keep our group toeing the party line but making
sure the policies on which we were all elected are adhered to in
committees of all descriptions.
''That's not as easy a task as some might think.''
The council's Labour Whip, Councillor Richard Gibb, is a former
provost of Hamilton and is also a Hamilton district councillor for
Stonehouse.
Councillor Eddie McAvoy, brother of Labour MP Tommy, was shop
stewards' convener at Hoover. He has been hailed as the man who helped
keep the company at Cambuslang.
SNP group leader Ms Ann Winning did not condemn the payments outright.
She said: ''They are getting paid professional wages and we would
expect a professional job. Time will tell whether this is indeed the
case.
''What is needed is a decent service for our constituents and if that
is not forthcoming then we and I'm sure the electorate will be calling
to task the whole operation, not just councillor allowances.''

A CALL for more funding support for deaf students was made by Mr David
Scott, principal of Donaldson's College for deaf children, in Edinburgh
yesterday.
Ramps, revolving doors, and lifts were a one-off cost, he said, but
the teaching support deaf people needed continued throughout their
studies, and the funding was inadequate.
Mr Scott announced the setting up of a Donaldson's project to study
the viability of providing support services to deaf children in
colleges.
Mr Scott was speaking during a visit to Donaldson's by Professor David
Martin, dean of the education faculty at Gallaudet University for the
Deaf in Washington, DC.

AYRSHIRE MPs are seeking a meeting with Industry Secretary Ian Lang to
discuss public safety after claims that information about British Gas
operations in the North Channel was not given to them.
The MPs fear that information has been kept from them by the Ministry
of Defence and British Gas since the discovery of large quantities of
munitions on the coastline in recent weeks.
Mr George Foulkes has written to Mr Lang asking for confirmation of
the Health and Safety Executive's role in assessing any risks.
He said: ''We are concerned at the mystery surrounding the imposition
and subsequent lifting of a prohibition notice and disturbed that
crucial information was apparently kept secret.''
