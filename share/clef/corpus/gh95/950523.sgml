SIMON Mitchell was born in Forres but, because his father wasin the
RAF, he spent most of his childhood abroad in exotic places such as
Malaysia.
A career in the property business took him to London until last month,
when he joined Richard Ellis in Glasgow as their Head of Agency.
Simon moved from London for career reasons and for a better quality of
life.
Working in the City meant that he had 90 minutes travelling to and
from work. ''I was getting tired of commuting. It was a case of up early
and home late, and I was not seeing much of my four young boys,'' says
Simon.
He took up his new job last month, and at present spends only weekends
with his family at their home near Bishop Stortford. In July Simon hopes
to settle into a new home near Cardross.
Despite the difficulties of searching for a new home, Simon has
already made himself familiar with the task facing him -- which includes
finding tenants for properties being handled by Richard Ellis.
''We now have 70,000 sq ft let in Tay House, and another 20,000 is
under offer, while a further 40,000 is being looked at seriously in this
property, which has a total of 160,000 sq ft,'' says Simon.
Telephone direct selling will have a major impact on Glasgow property
development, according to Simon.
''Glasgow is now one of the established centres in the UK for this
type of business along with Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool, and Bristol.''

HAMISH McLean certainly seems to be into numbers, although his
customers can be forgiven if they think his knowledge of history is not
quite up to scratch.
Hamish owns two hostelries, Lock 27 in Anniesland, Glasgow, and Fifty
Five BC in Bearsden.
In the case of Lock 27 it is simple enough. The bar was given this
title because it sits beside the 27th lock on the Forth and Clyde Canal,
which runs between Bowling and Grangemouth.
However, when it comes to Mr McLean's restaurant-cum-bar at Bearsden
Cross there have been a few raised eyebrows over the figures.
The area has many Roman connections, with remains of Roman baths not
far away and, of course, the Antonine Wall half-a-mile away.
The restaurant's title refers to the date of the Romans' arrival in
Britain, but as most locals are well aware, the Antonine Wall was built
about 142AD.
''I realised this, but I thought Fifty Five BC rang more bells in
people's minds,'' says Hamish, who volunteers the fact that the Romans
reached Scotland in 43 AD.
Hamish may well be into history lessons, but the reason he is now
involved in the hospitality industry is because he was not quite so
enthusiastic about pharmacy lessons.
His family own several chemist shops and Hamish went to Strathclyde
University to study pharmacy but after two years decided that it was not
his scene.
He quit university and began looking for a different type of career.
''While I was a student I had worked in bars, and thought that I could
run a better pub than some of those I worked in.''
He bought a derelict lock keeper's cottage and built a modern pub on
the site.
That was nine years ago, and in 1993 he added Fifty Five BC after
taking over an ailing restaurant and converting it into a public
bar-cum-bistro establishment.
''I'm very pleased with the way Fifty Five BC is going,'' says Hamish.
''It is a French/Scottish style of food and our chef Gary MacLean made
it into the last eight of the UK Young Chef of the Year competiton.
''Food actually makes up 40 per cent of our turnover.''
Next year is the tenth birthday of Lock 27 and Hamish is planning a
major refurbishment for the pub. He hopes that the stretch of canal
which it is on will be cleaned up in time for the birthday celebrations.
''The British Waterways Board are hoping to replace their lock 27 this
year,'' he says. Hamish McLean is on the lookout for a third site, but
as yet has not got any fixed number in mind for the title.

<HEADLINE>Labour surge fails to show. SNP set for by-election landslide</HEADLINE>

THE SNP is on course for an emphatic victory in the Perth and Kinross
by-election, according to a System 3 poll for The Herald which shows
Tory support sliding and Labour's much-vaunted surge failing to
materialise.
The Herald is the only newspaper to have conducted two polls in the
constituency, making the results and underlying trend directly
comparable. The poll conducted on Saturday and Sunday shows that, in the
course of the past two months, SNP front-runner Roseanna Cunningham has
pushed even further ahead, up four points, to 52%.
Support for Conservative John Godfrey, who is defending the seat of
the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, has slid from 20% to 15%.
One of the biggest surprises is that, despite all the hype surrounding
New Labour -- with a stream of Shadow Cabinet Ministers arriving in the
constituency, including two visits by leader Tony Blair -- it is stuck
firmly on the same 23% figure as it recorded in a similar System 3 poll
carried out for The Herald on March 17, before the by-election date had
been set.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats, who had also hoped to benefit from the
troubles besetting the Tory Party, will be disappointed to be stuck on
the 9% they recorded in March.
Both Mr Godfrey and Labour candidate Douglas Alexander left the
recording of a television debate in Perth City Hall last night clearly
discomfited by the outcome of the much anticipated poll.
Mr Alexander refused to comment and left it for his party officials to
explain why Labour claims it was closing fast on the SNP appeared to be
unfounded.
The general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, Mr Jack McConnell,
said: ''Although even this poll shows us doubling our support since the
last General Election, we know that it has not picked up the movement
taking place in the past 48 hours.
''The striking message of this poll is that the Tory is finished and
no split vote will let the Tories win. This will affect many reluctant
SNP voters. We will be spending the next three days pressing the 57% of
intending SNP voters who do not want a separate Scottish state to vote
Labour.''
This was a reference to the fact that our poll shows that 49% of those
planning to vote SNP actually record a preference for a strong devolved
Scottish parliament within the UK, compared to 43% indicating a
preference for complete independence.
Among Labour's support, 68% stated a preference for a devolved
parliament, while 16% wanted an independent Scotland.
The clear winner from our poll, Ms Cunningham, said last night: ''I am
overjoyed. I am pleased that the feeling we have had throughout this
campaign has been borne out. It appears our hard work is being taken
account of. We are campaigning positively for things, in contrast to the
negative and personalised campaigning which has characterised the
approach of our opponents.
''It indicates that the Tories are being given a sharp lesson not to
insult people's intelligence and not to take people for granted.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrats were also clear losers from the System
3 poll because they had been pushing the local credentials and strengths
as a candidate of Mrs Veronica Linklater.
She said last night: ''These figures confirm that there is an
unprecedented level of undecided voters in this constituency. On the
doorsteps, particularly in the rural areas, undecided voters are
switching to Liberal Democrat and we expect that to be reflected in
Thursday's poll. There is still all to play for.''
The Conservative candidate was also crestfallen at his showing but he,
too, took comfort in the ''don't know'' factor. Mr Godfrey said:
''Constituency polls are notoriously unreliable, especially in a large
rural seat such as Perth and Kinross. The only significant statistic is
that nearly one third of the electorate are still undecided. This will
be the key to Thursday's result and we remain confident of holding the
seat.''
The first Herald poll in the constituency was carried out on March 11
and 12 after the death of Sir Nicholas but long before the Government
set a date for the by-election. Our new poll was conducted on Saturday
and Sunday in 1047 homes at 80 sampling points across the constituency
and the results were balanced for gender, age, and class to fit the
profile of the area as a whole.
Of the significant level of voters yet to make up their mind there
were 19% who said they were undecided, up three points from March, there
were 7% who refused to answer, up four points from March, and a
consistent 5% said they had decided not to cast a vote.
One other unusual feature of the poll was that two of the fringe
candidates made it into the statistics by scoring 1% of support -- Lord
David Sutch and his Official Monster Munch Raving Looney Party, and Mr
Vivian Linacre of the Anti-European Union UK Independence Party.
While more than 50% of electors intend to vote SNP, according to the
poll -- less than a quarter of voters actually support the party's main
policy of an independent Scotland.
On these findings, the SNP appears to be capturing the protest vote
and its appeal lies not in its policies but in its ability to unseat the
Tories.
A separate party by party breakdown of policies supported appears to
confirm these findings. It shows a higher level of support amongst SNP
supporters for a devolved parliament than for outright independence.
Some form of self government is extremely popular with the polled
electors of Perth and Kinross. Almost three-quarters (74%) questioned
were in favour of either a Scottish parliament within a UK framework or
complete independence.
The breakdown shows that more than half the people polled (51%)
favoured a devolved Scottish parliament compared with 23% in favour of
outright independence.
The analysis of findings by party supported indicates that the ''don't
knows'' may contain a substantial number of Conservative voters.
On the hustings last night, the Liberal Democrats called on Labour to
join them to stop the rail sell-off ''dead in its tracks''.
Mr Paddy Ashdown said his party would return to public control a
privatised Railtrack and urged Labour to make a similar pledge.
The Liberal Democrat leader said Railtrack was the key to an
integrated rail network and could be brought under public control for
half a billion pounds or less.

NEIGHBOURS would like to know more details about the proposed changes
before work is carried out to alter or extend nearby properties, a study
commissioned by the Scottish Office shows.
The report recommends that planning authorities should take more
responsibility for informing neighbours about applications, that
applications should be advertised in local papers, and neighbours be
renotified if important changes are made to applications.
While the principles of the notification system were widely supported,
it was felt procedures could be simplified.
It was also found there were differences in practice by authorities in
giving advice and handling amendments. The Scottish Office is to publish
a consultation document in response to the points raised in the survey.
The research involved 28 in-depth case studies of planning
applications in different locations and was based on fieldwork carried
out by the School of Planning and Housing, Edinburgh College of Art,
Heriot Watt University, and Peter C Allan (Chartered Town Planning
Consultants) Ltd.

ALEX Miller, the longest serving manager in the premier division, can
clock up another three years at Easter Road if he so wishes. The man who
has been in charge there for the past nine years will find a two-year
extension to his existing contract awaiting him when he returns from his
trip to Japan, where he is wearing his other hat as No.2 to
international manager Craig Brown.
Miller, who has a year of his current contract still to serve, has
achieved a rare longevity in the top league as a result of workaholic
tendencies and a devotion to learning about the game that is as
dedicated as anybody in the country.
In his time with Hibs, the former Rangers player has taken them to
their first trophy in 21 years, when they lifted the Skol Cup by beating
Dunfermline 2-0 in the final of 1991, and very nearly did the same trick
again two years later when they were beaten 2-1 in the final by Rangers.
The ex-manager of St Mirren and Morton really proved not only his
application but also his resilience during the rocky years under the
David Duff-Jim Gray era, especially in the months when the bid to take
over the club by Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer revealed the true
parlous state of its finances.
Rumours were insistent that when the new board took over, Miller would
be discarded along with the old regime, but he not only survived but was
given full support by chairman Douglas Cromb who, unlike others of his
ilk, meant what he said.
The news that Hibs have offered him another three years at least as
team leader comes just at a time when the rumour factory has been
including Miller's name in bulletins, but this time in a positive vein.
The suggestion is that the man generally recognised as one of the
Scottish game's finest coaches has made so big an impression as Brown's
assistant at national level that the moment may be near when he will be
asked if he would like to take on a full-time role with the SFA.
That would present a dilemma for Miller, who has clearly enjoyed being
involved with the international side, although he has such an energy for
football work that it might be hard for him to give up the daily
schedule of a club manager.
If Miller did decide to opt for a change in direction, provided he
gets the chance, Hibs would probably turn to their former assistant
manager, Murdo MacLeod, who has just completed a marvellous first season
as a manager in his own right, leading Dumbarton to promotion from the
second division.

CELTIC yesterday were hammered by the Tribunal which had been set up
by Scotland's football officials to fix a compensation figure for
Kilmarnock after they had lost their manager, Tommy Burns, and his
assistant, Billy Stark, to the Glasgow club last summer.
The Parkhead side now must pay Kilmarnock #200,000 after having failed
to reach agreement with officials of the Ayrshire side when that
opportunity was offered.
The decision means that the poaching of Burns and Stark from
Kilmarnock now has cost Celtic #300,000. Earlier they were found guilty
of inducing Burns to leave his job as manager at Rugby Park and were
fined #100,000 by the Scottish Football League.
Following that, Celtic chief executive Fergus McCann appealed against
the verdict of the League Management Committee. At a full meeting of all
league clubs he gathered just ONE vote of support.
Yesterday there was no hiding place for Celtic. The Tribunal statement
declared: ''The Arbitral Tribunal held two procedural hearings and took
evidence extending over three days. Before the first procedural hearing
and at the conclusion of all the evidence, the Tribunal offered parties
an opportunity to settle matters in issue between them. Settlement was
not, unfortunately, achieved.
''Having considered all the evidence and submissions of parties, the
Tribunal assessed compensation payable by Celtic FC to Kilmarnock FC for
the loss of services of Mr Burns as Kilmarnock's manager, and of Mr
Stark as Kilmarnock's assistant manager, in the total sum of #200,000.''
The decision was another shattering blow to Celtic as they prepared
for the Scottish Cup final against Airdrie at Hampden this weekend.
There is no appeal available as the clubs had already agreed to accept
the findings of the three men who had been appointed by the Scottish
Football Association.
The chairman of the independent Tribunal was Lord Ranald McLean, and
he was joined by John Wilson, a former chairman of Morton, and Jimmy
Clydesdale, who was, until last season, a director of Hearts.
After the decision Kilmarnock chairman Bob Fleeting, who had been at
the centre of the storm for almost a year, said: ''I am delighted that,
after 10 and a half months, this the matter is over.
''I cannot comment on the mechanics of the Tribunal which was private
but we are obviously pleased at the way the affair has been handled, and
pleased with the compensation fugure.
''This club has always recognised that Celtic are one of the world's
great clubs, and it is a pity that we had to go this far. The
relationship between the two clubs has been damaged but not irreparably.
It is now my job to ensure that the damage can be repaired. But I have
to admit that is is a sorry day when you have to go to these lengths.
''Now it has to be hoped that everyone at Rugby Park will recognise
the contribution made to this club by Tommy Burns and Billy Stark. We
should all welcome them when they return here next season with their own
club.''
From Celtic Park and the chief executive there was a much briefer
statement. It said: ''We are disappointed with the costly result to
Celtic, of the Tribunal, and the Scottish Football League's decision in
this matter. However, we are pleased that the issue has been concluded.
The club now will focus its attention on winning the Tennent's Scottish
Cup.''
The statement was signed by Fergus McCann, who now must wonder whether
it would not have been better to try to reach agreement with Kilmarnock
when he first decided that he wanted Burns to take over as Celtic
manager.
The word on the football grapevine throughout this affair has always
been that if Celtic had negotiated a settlement with Kilmarnock, it
would all have been settled months ago.
And it might have been done for far less money than it has cost
Celtic, and it would have been done without the damage to the club's
reputation in the game in Scotland.
I, for one, never thought I would see the day when Celtic were so
isolated on any issue as they were on this one.
Now, at last, the whole sorry business is over, and the cloud which
has been hanging over Burns and Stark and both clubs has been lifted.
Celtic have been punished -- by the Scottish League and now by the
Tribunal -- and, hopefully, the man in charge at Parkhead has learned
his lesson.

THE future of Castle Douglas auction company Wallets Marts has taken a
new turn. Recently it was suggested that the mart, subject of a takeover
bid by James Craig of Ayr, could merge instead with Thomson, Roddick and
Laurie, based in Annan.
However, Wallets' chairman Mr TC Gillespie has circulated his
shareholders pointing out that Thomson, Roddick and Laurie will not be
making an offer to Wallets shareholders and that no other proposal from
TRL has been received which 'in the view of the Board and its advisers
could merit serious consideration of such a fundamental change.'
The letter adds: ''If TRL makes a further announcement of its
intentions directly to the Press, you are strongly advised to take no
action.''

CELTIC could not have realised the trouble and bitterness which would
follow their decision to appoint ''favourite son'' Tommy Burns as their
manager last summer, writes Ken Gallacher.
When Burns flew home from holiday in Tenerife for the fateful meeting
with Parkhead chief executive Fergus McCann, who had sacked previous
club manager Lou Macari six weeks earlier, he clearly believed that the
appointment was a simple matter of coming to terms with the man he
wanted and going from there.
The problem for McCann and Celtic was that the rules of the Scottish
Football League do not allow one club to poach another club's employee,
be it player or manager, while under contract.
That is why the league came down on Celtic with a record fine of
#100,000, and why there was a follow-up compensation figure set by an
independent Tribunal yesterday.
And McCann, who promised that he would not pay ''one thin dime in
compensation,'' now must find 3,160,000 of those now famous dimes to
hand onto Kilmarnock.
At Rugby Park, Bob Fleeting was finding it hard to hide his joy. But
the Kilmarnock chairman has been able, all along, to see that the
long-running saga did not do his club any good, harmed the image of
Scottish football as a whole, and damaged Celtic.
There was a bitterness which grew between the clubs and between the
protagonists and the fans. Fleeting did not go to the Hampden board room
when the clubs played each other in the first of their league clashes of
the season.
Celtic fans have talked of boycotting Rugby Park.
And yet it could all have been so different. Fleeting would not have
been happy to lose Burns, who was a friend as well as his team manager.
But he would have been able to sense that Burns would not have been
able to resist a call from the club he played for with such distinction.
All that was needed then was a touch of common sense, and if that had
been on offer then the two clubs could have met, discussed their
differences, settled on a compensation fee, and got on with the job of
playing football.
Celtic would not have lost face as they now have done, and they would
not have had to pay out as much money.
And everyone might have been able to live just a little more happily
ever after.

<HEADLINE>Companies use weak pound to raise export prices. Aircraft lift UK import bill</HEADLINE>

A one-off delivery of aircraft worth about #200m -- the equivalent of
two Jumbo jets -- boosted Britain's import bill last month and resulted
in a nearly doubled visible trade deficit with the non-EU countries.
The shortfall increased from #238m in March to #474m in April, but
after excluding oil and erratic items, which include aircraft, the trend
was in the other direction with the deficit dropping from #375m to
#303m.
In the latest three months the non-EU deficit fell back from #1444m,
boosted by the #936m shortfall in December, to #1034m. In the three
months to April last year the deficit was #1465m.
The figures also suggested that companies were taking advantage of the
pound's weakness to push through higher export prices. In April export
prices rose by 4% to record levels and in the latest three months by
4.5%.
Import prices gained 1% last month and were 6.5% ahead in the latest
three months. City analysts were puzzled by this aspect of the figures.
Non-EU trade is heavily dollar-denominated, and while the pound has
dropped significantly this year it had made modest headway against the
dollar.
In value terms exports, excluding oil and erratics, to non-EU
countries increased by 3.5% in the three months to April and were 13.1%
higher than in the same three months a year ago. By volume exports rose
by only 0.7% in the latest three months, but were 7.7% higher than in
the same three months of 1994.
The value of imports, excluding oil and erratics, to the non-EU
countries rose by 4.2% in the latest three months, and was 8.5% higher
than in the same three months a year ago. Volume was 1.3% down on the
previous three months and 4.7% lower than in the same three months a
year ago.
The Central Statistical Office said the latest trends showed export
volume fairly flat and import volume falling. In financial circles there
was concern at the sharp jump in import prices and in the sluggishness
of exports.
But these figures give only a partial view of Britain's trading, the
bulk of which is with countries inside the European Union. The EU
figures, which become available several weeks later because they are
compiled through VAT instead of Customs and Excise returns, are
potentially more interesting since sterling has declined sharply against
the major Continental currencies.
Last month again produced a surplus in oil with non-EU countries. It
was the fourth successive month when the oil account was in the black,
the first time this has occurred since 1988.
In the latest three months there was a surplus in oil trading of #178m
compared with a deficit of #88m in the previous three months. This was
the largest three-monthly surplus since the first quarter of 1988.
The volume of crude oil exports to non-EU countries by nearly 50% in
the latest three months. Imports rose by 2%.

MORE than 200 breeders from the UK, Ireland and overseas are expected
at 'Aberdeen-Angus Heritage 95' later this year to celebrate 150 years
of the famous Scottish breed of cattle.
The four-day event starting on September 28 will include visits to
both ancestral and modern homes of the breed in its native north-east.
''This will be an opportunity for breeders to learn more about the
history of our great breed and help re-establish it in an area where
many new herds have been founded in recent years,'' said Robin Michie,
Bankhead, New Aberlour, chairman of the North-east Aberdeen Angus
Breeders' Club which is co-hosting the event with the Highland A-A Club.
The weekend programme includes visits to Tillyfour, Alford, where
William McCombie founded the breed 150 years ago, evolved from the Angus
'doddies' and the Buchan 'hummlie', hardy black polled cattle recorded
in north east Scotland as far back as the 12th century. It will also
visit the Ballindalloch herd, Banffshire, the oldest herd in continuous
existence since its foundation in 1861
Mr Michie said there would be strong emphasis on marketing of quality
beef and added: ''As pedigree breeders we must recognise the need to
harness all modern genetic technology available to improve the breed and
provide the type of cattle which the commercial beef producer requires
to meet the demand for quality.''
The event will feature of sale of selected Aberdeen-Angus females at
Thainstone, Inverurie, on September 29.

In Pretoria
THE Scotland side to meet Ivory Coast here on Friday in the Rugby
World Cup was selected last night, but team officials will not announce
the names until later today.
The selection meeting began once the squad had returned from a day of
rest and recuperation at the leisure resort of Sun City during which
they golfed and jet-skied.
Four players -- Gavin Hastings, Craig Chalmers, Kenny Logan and David
Hiltonc -- remained behind at the team base in Pretoria for treatment to
minor ailments and injuries.
Manager Duncan Paterson said last night that he had still to receive a
medical report on the players but he expected that all would be fit for
selection.
Meanwhile, Ivory Coast have denied they are an over-physical squad.
On the other hand, prop Toussaint Djehi, the acknowledged hard man in
a pack of strong but relatively untutored forwards, admitted: ''I do not
know the names of the Scottish props and do not care about that.''
Lock Djakaria Sanoko, who plays for Biarritz in the French League and
the West African side's one proven top flight performer, insisted: ''The
reputation we have for being dirty is not deserved.'' Scotland are still
wary.
As for Wales, their coach, Alex Evans, wants the inbuilt Welsh skill
to take over from the natural passion -- the Welsh dragon-fire -- which
he reckons is ruining his side's play.

* BARCELONA yesterday completed the #3,333,333 signing of Tottenham
star Gica Popescu. The 27-year-old has struggled to come to terms with
the demands of the English game and Spurs manager Gerry Francis was keen
to off-load the Romanian international to raise funds for possible
transfer targets this summer.
Popescu, who has signed a four-year contract, is expected to replace
Ronald Koeman -- who leaves for Feyenoord at the end of the season -- at
the heart of the Barcelona defence.

* SCOTLAND began their preparations for their second Kirin Cup match
against Ecuador tomorrow night with a training session in their new base
at Toyama, but the main talking point remains the sending-off of John
Spencer in the opening game against Japan in Hiroshima, writes Damon
Quigley.
Immediately after that match Craig Brown said that Spencer's actions,
which had brought cautions for dissent and then for retaliation, had
been ''daft''. Last night Brown made it clear that Spencer was very much
on a final warning.
''It's fair to say that we could not accept this sort of thing
happening again since Spencer had already been sent off when he played
for the Under-21 team. When we consider team selection we have to
remember the possibility that he might be sent off and leave the team a
man short,'' said Brown.
''What this must do surely is to make him more aware of the
responsibility involved in playing for Scotland.''
Scotland will play Ecuador next despite the fact that, unusually,
Brown has very little information about the opposition.
Brown will speak with Carlos Perreira, who led Brazil in last year's
World Cup and is now manager at Valencia, to find out more about the
opponents. Scotland need to win convincingly if they are to have any
chance of taking the trophy home.
Motherwell defender Rob McKinnon sustained severe bruising to his left
knee after the late tackle by Narahashi which led him to be stretchered
off against the Japanese and he is unlikely to play. There is better
news of Colin Calderwood who felt the recurrence of a calf injury and
also was substituted in the same game. He has stated that he intends to
play on Wednesday and both Craig Burley and Billy McKinlay are also
expected to be ready despite taking knocks.
At some stage, Stephen Crawford of Raith Rovers will make his
international debut to cap a remarkable year for the young striker.

INCREASED livestock entries and a bumper crop of food products are
pointing their way to more success for the Royal Highland Show next
month.
Livestock entries to date show an increase of 10% over last year with
numbers for dairy cattle and some other competitions still to ne
announced.
In the beef cattle section there are 154 listed for the Highland
cattle, the breed that is staging an international gathering before and
during the show, and British Limousin will have the second strongest
display of 109; Beef Shorthorn (48), Aberdeen Angus (76), Galloway (39),
Belted Galloway (35) and Hereford (57).
In the sheep lines continental breeds top the numerical order with
Texels (celebrating their 21st anniversary) almost doubling last years
entry at 233. Total sheep entries are 1317. Goats 183, heavy horses 360,
light horses 975.
The Food from Scotland Exhibition has attracted a number of new and
innovative products to appeal to the 150,000 visitors that are expected
to attend over the four days with the highlight focusing on a display
from Dumfries and Galloway created by a partnership of Dumfries and
Galloway Enterprise and the Regional Council.
RHAS chairman Robin Forrest said the food exhibition was an excellent
platform for the launch of new products.
''Scottish companies are making significant investment to ensure their
products achieve high visibility in the market place and the Food from
Scotland Exhibition enables them to showcase their goods to the
catering, wholesale and retail trade , while recouping some costs
through stand sales.''
Last year's overall winer at the Scottish Food Innovation Awards was
Castle MacLellan Foods which is adding to its range of meat, fish, game
and vegetable pates and terrines.
Managing director Colin Warden said: ''We fully endorse strategic
alliance among Scotland's food producers and processors as it allows
small and medium sized firms to pool their expertise. For entrepreneurs
with innovative new products but perhaps lacking in marketing skills it
offers a away forward. There are benefits for the food producers working
in partnership and for their customers who gain a greater choice.''
A livestock snack feeder invented by Adam Leggat, New House Farm,
Perth, has been awarded a Silver Award in the New Implement Award
Scheme. It is claimed to reduce feed waste and bullying, resulting in
less stress on stock and handler.

* This week's tip comes from the professional at Torphin Golf Club in
Edinburgh.
ONE of the most damaging and common faults in golf is the slice. It
can be caused by a variety of errors, but if you are struggling with
shots going to the right, then I suggest you check your posture.
Many club golfers fall in to the trap of keeping the knees too
straight, and tilting over from the waist. This double fault leads to an
over-steep swing, and sliced shots.
The knees should be flexed, and the back relatively straight with just
a slight bend forward from the waist. It is similar to sitting on a
stool.
Improving the posture will help improve the swing plane. An incorrect
set-up is one of the most usual causes of a slice that can not only land
you in bad trouble, but also results in a loss of power.
But, with practice, it should be relatively easy to correct.

ANYONE watching Lorraine Morrow playing the last hole at Ranfurly
Castle in the club's Spring Meeting might tactfully have avoided asking
how she fared.
The 17-year-old mis-hit her drive, then duffed the next into
undergrowth. A penalty drop and one more stroke later she was in a
bunker, thence over the back of the green. A fluffed pitch and three
putts later an ugly 9 was marked on the card.
Another sorry tale of what might have been? Well, not exactly.
Beforehand there had been 17 excellent holes, including pars at the
three par-3s, and despite that closing disaster she still carded a gross
88 -- a personal best by 11 shots -- to beat her 28 handicap by no fewer
than 13 shots to be first lady this season to claim our the bandit-of
the week title -- by a mere stroke.
''I was shaking when I reached the turn,'' said Lorraine, who is about
to start training as an optician. ''I counted the score up to 41 and
asked my marker if that was right. She said: 'don't even think about it,
just concentrate on your golf.' I managed that until the end.''
Our bandit has been playing golf on and off since she was four, broke
her 36 handicap for the first time last year, is now down to 21 and
believes there is still room for improvement. She may have a chance to
do so in our final at Haggs Castle on October 4. This week's leading

* THE American entry for the Scottish Open championship, to be played
at Carnoustie frim July 12 to 15, was further strengthened yesterday
with the announcement that Peter Jacobsen, currently the leading
money-winner on the US Tour, will play. He joins Masters champion Ben
Crenshaw and Davis Love, who was runner-up after having gained the last
qualifying place by winning the New Orleans open, achievements which
earned nomination as the tour's player of the month for April.
Jacobsen, aged 41, brought his career total of victories to six in
February, when he won the Pebble Beach invitation pro-am and the Buick
Invitational in consecutive weeks -- a rare achievement which has helped
to take him into third place on the US Ryder Cup team points list and an
almost certain second appearance in the match against Europe in
September.
Charles Perring, the championship's director, indicated yesterday that
other prominent overseas names would be confirmed in the coming weeks.
They may include Tiger Woods, the US Amateur champion, who is exempt for
the Open Championship at St Andrews the next week, and Perring will be
at Wentworth for the Volvo PGA championship this week on a European
recruitment drive.

<HEADLINE>Textiles to benefit from Italian link. Glasgow becomes only the second centre for the Italian Chamber of Commerce in the United Kingdom</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH and Italian textiles companies are negotiating joint ventures
to take on rapidly increasing competition from the Far East, it was
yesterday revealed.
Attending the launch of a Scottish section of the Italian Chamber of
Commerce in Glasgow, chamber president Leonardo Simonelli said talks
between textiles companies in the two countries were already underway.
Joint ventures would involve Scottish and Italian companies, usually
regarded as fierce competitors, pooling their complementary skills to
increase efficiency.
Addressing Italian-Scottish business people at the launch in Il Signor
Caruso restaurant -- which was simultaneously opened by Italian
ambassador Paolo Galli -- Dr Simonelli said competition between the two
countries in the textiles sector must be viewed instead as an
opportunity for cooperation.
That way, he added, companies could together face the challenge from
China, Malaysia, India and Thailand.
Although the Italian Chamber of Commerce has had a presence in London
since 1886, the Glasgow-based Scottish office is the first to be opened
elsewhere in the UK. The chamber also plans to establish a presence in
Manchester, Cardiff and Belfast.
Yesterday's event, which brought about Mr Galli's first visit to
Scotland as ambassador, was also attended by Italian consul general
Giancarlo Izzo.
Mr Galli said: ''The time has come for the Italians in Scotland, and
for the Scots who work with Italy, to be even more adventurous and
produce more initiatives.''
Dr Simonelli emphasised the growing importance of ''regions'' within
the European single market and the advantages for businesses of more
direct links, which cut out the necessity of going through London or
Rome.
The Italian Chamber of Commerce hopes to develop the country's
existing interests in Scotland's energy, construction, food and fashion
industries.
On the offshore fabrication side, Scottish yards face the prospect of
losing orders to Italian competitors. However, Dr Simonelli sees this as
another sector which could throw up joint venture opportunities.
The Italian chamber believes its Glasgow-based section will create a
two-way flow of business, with Scottish companies in the engineering and
tourism industries among those who could benefit from the link.
Last year, Italy was the ninth largest export market for Scotch
whisky. Taking in the relatively small production of one Northern Irish
whiskey distillery, exports to Italy totalled #73m, up 22%.
It is hoped exports of Scotch will be further boosted by the new
alliance and, perhaps to aid this effort, Mr Galli was presented with a
bottle of 15-year-old Islay single malt Laphroaig by Allied Distillers.
The Scottish section of the Italian chamber will be headed by Leandro
Franchi, a partner in Glasgow solicitors' firm Franchi Finnieston.

THE Glasgow City European Club Champions' Cup -- the fourth version of
which concluded at the Kelvin Hall on Sunday -- is set to go from
strength to strength.
Host club and tournament winners City of Glasgow Ragazzi are already
looking at ways of improving the product for next year.
The three European teams which played at the Kelvin Hall -- LRI Malev
(Hungary), Noliko Maaseik (Belgium) and Team Luxembourg -- have all
expressed a desire to return.
Last weekend's tournament was the fourth hosted by the club and the
first time European teams have competed -- though last year two entered
but later withdrew -- and the content from abroad is likely to increase.
This year, a women's event -- involving four British teams -- was
introduced and the tournament stretched to three days.
''We will be looking to improve the standard again next year,'' said
club coach Tommy Dowens.
''The next step is to introduce a European side into the women's
tournament.
''We feel the event is now established with clubs from Europe wanting
to return.
''It has always been difficult to attract European teams to Scotland
but we have shown it can be done.''

SCOTTISH racing fans are joining a campaign to save the job of Dougie
Fraser, the only Scot among the list of raceourse commentators in
Britain, who has been dropped by SIS, the company which pipes live
racing into betting shops throughout the country.
The 39-year-old who now lives in Thirsk was removed after a survey of
the 22 commentators on the list carried out by Satellite Information
Services and Racecourse Association commentators, who merged last
September.
His style of delivery and his Scottish accent are believed to be the
reasons given by the racecourses -- an assessment, remarkably, supported
by the five in Scotland.
One commentator who works regularly in Scotland and the North of
England said: ''There is widespread support for him. Within the
commentating ranks, Dougie Fraser is considered to be extremely
accurate. It is unknown for him to make an error.''
In the survey, Australian Jim (Croc) McGrath came out on top,
andGraham Goode and Derek Thompson of Channel Four racing were in the
top 10.
Fraser was last heard giving a commentary from Hexham on April 29, but
he is scheduled to give three more before his contract expires. He will
continue to work for SIS as a freelance racecourse representative,
giving betting information.
At his home yesterday, Fraser said the decision not to renew his
contract has come as ''a surprise and a great disappointment.''
''I was not aware a survey was being taken, but I have heard that the
Scottish racecourses were among those that did not support me.''
Fraser, who started his commentating career in the George Square,
Glasgow, office of Exchange Telegraph in 1979 relaying racecourse
commentaries to Scottish betting shops, was later promoted to racecourse
commentator. He joined SIS as a racecourse commentator in 1992.
Fraser said: ''I thought I had a reasonable future as a racecourse
commentator but that has not proved to be the case. A large section of
my income has disappeared at a stroke.
He added: ''My fellow commentators have been very supportive and a lot
of racegoers have told me they believe I have suffered a bit of an
injustice.''
In a letter to the Sporting Life, the racing daily newspaper, a
Northern Ireland reader said: ''Fraser is one of the most articulate,
accurate and grammatically correct callers of them all. To be told he
has no support -- not even in Scotland -- is beyond belief.''

THE Celtic player who, more than any other, wants to take part in the
Tennents Scottish Cup final on Saturday might make it after all. Peter
Grant, who missed the Coca Cola Cup final because of suspension, as well
as the 1989 Scottish final -- the last time Celtic won a trophy --
because of injury, is making an unexpectedly rapid recovery from the
knee ligament damage he suffered at Tannadice two weeks ago.
The midfield man, who has been at Parkhead since July, 1982, is now a
possible starter against Airdrie. ''This time last week he had no
chance,'' said his astonished manager, Tommy Burns, ''but there has been
such a remarkable improvement that we have real optimism about his
prospects.''
Burns explained that the type of injury, a knee twist, ought to have
meant the 29-year-old Grant being forgotten as a contender for a place
in the final. ''But he is a very special man, as well as a very special
Celtic player, and it is his desire that has got him this far.''
Burns intends to give Grant every chance to make it but expects to
make a decision by Thursday. ''He did some running today at training and
that is very encouraging,'' said the manager.
Burns pointed out just how painful, not just physically, the knee
injury was for Grant, who sustained the injury following a tackle by Jim
McInally in the last league game of the season. ''Tony Mowbray and Andy
Walker went down into the dressing room and spent the second half at
Tannadice comforting him, he was so distraught at the thought of missing
the final.
''That also shows the kind of spirit there is about the place just
now.''
Burns believes the break in Italy has further fostered that
togetherness which can be so important an ingredient in any club's
ambitions. ''It was just what we wanted. The lads had a good couple of
days training and a few games of golf. We also enjoyed a visit to Milan,
the cathedral etc, and as a group it proved very worthwile, very
relaxing.''
His only other injury worry, apart from a knock suffered by Brian
O'Neil in training yesterday, is Andy Walker but he has made good
progress following his ankle injury. ''He trained for the first time for
a couple of weeks and was in good form, missing a couple of fine
chances,'' quipped the manager, whose ruddy complexion denied his
revelation that the weather in Italy had not been so great.
Like Walker, Grant will know himself if he is able to take part on
Saturday but the signs are that both will be available for selection,
leaving only Mowbray, who is suspended, out of the reckoning. Mowbray,
at his own request, wants to sign on a monthly basis for next season,
turning down the one-year contract offered. ''That is the way he wants
it,'' said Burns, ''and we are happy to along with it. Tony was offered
the same terms as before.''
Team captain Paul McStay is expected to complete his new two-year deal
by the end of the week.
Celtic will head for Seamill on Thursday to complete their
preparation, but the manager believes there is not quite the same
pressure on his side as there was before the Coca Cola Cup final, which
they lost to Raith Rovers in a penalty shoot-out. ''I don't think the
strain is the same as then,'' he said, ''because the players have now
lived through that, know what it is about, and have bounced back to
reach another final. They could still make it a memorable season for
us.''
Asked if he would consider winning the cup making it a successful
season, he replied: ''I think already we could say there has been an
improvement. Reaching two finals when this team has not been in one for
six years has to be an improvement.
''I think the days of winning everything are over. If you look at
Rangers this season, Manchester United, and even Blackburn who have
spent many millions and heav now won their first major prize, you see
how difficult it is. Getting the club back to compete for these prizes
was our first aim.''
Burns finished the positive part of his chat with this promise. ''We
are not going to worry away our chance of winning the cup, '' he said,
referring to the pressure of the long absence from lifting any prizes at
the club. ''We are going to Hampden to win the cup and put on a right
good performance.''
He was nowhere near as definite about his chances of signing new
players in the near future. ''You would need to ask Mr McCann about
that,'' he said, and when pressed if there was any likelihood of an
imminent signing replied: ''No comment.''
Chairman Fergus McCann, who has been doing the negotiating for players
wanted by Burns, among them Belgian striker Marc Degryse, was not
available for comment but it does not look likely that there will be a
new face on the Parkhead block this week.
Meanwhile, midfield man Phil O'Donnell may have to go into hospital
for an operation after the final.
* BARCELONA yesterday completed the #3,333,333 signing of Tottenham
star Gica Popescu. The 27-year-old has struggled to come to terms with
the demands of the English game and Spurs manager Gerry Francis was keen
to off-load the Romanian international to raise funds for possible
transfer targets this summer.
Popescu, who has signed a four-year contract, is expected to replace
Ronald Koeman -- who leaves for Feyenoord at the end of the season -- at
the heart of the Barcelona defence.

KENNY Middlemiss strained the ligaments in his ankle during a practice
session yesterday to end his chances with partner Elinor Allen in the
mixed doubles at the World Badminton Championships in Lausanne,
Switzerland, writes Gillian Dorricott.
Five times Scottish champions and the only seeded Scots in the
competition, the pair were given the disappointing news that they could
not play after the tournament doctor warned the Edinburgh player not to
take part.
''It's a huge disappointment,'' said Middlemiss, who posted two superb
wins in the team events with his partner. ''I wasn't even stretching or
reaching for a shot. I was standing still and just bent down to pick up
a shuttle.''
However the good news for the Scots came in the form of a fine win
from Scottish No.1 Bruce Flockhart, of Stirling University. Scottish
results:
B Flockhart beat E Thobois (France) 17-14, 15-9; C Robertson lost to O
Pontgratz (Germany) 15-4, 15-1; A Gibson lost to N Zhang (Japan) 11-3,

BRITAIN'S biggest building society became even larger yesterday after
members of the Leeds Permanent Building Society voted overwhelmingly to
merge with the Halifax.
Leeds chairman Malcolm Barr told members meeting in Leeds that 95% of
investors and 94% of borrowers had voted in favour with 672,000 votes
cast from the total of 2.7 million entitled to participate.
Halifax members were even more enthusiastic with 97.7% saying ''yes.''
Some 1.24 million voted in favour with a mere 30,000 against among
investors and borrowers split 402,000 for the merger and just 10,000
saying ''no.''
Only a simple majority was required to create a building society which
will have grown to net assets of #94bn of which Leeds contributes #21bn.
The next step is formal ratification by the Building Societies
Commission on June 27 with the merger taking effect on August 1.
Both meetings were at times lively with some members regretting the
loss of the Leeds name and saying that it was not a merger but a
takeover by the Halifax.
Mr Barr said '' What we are not doing at the Leeds is giving anything
to the Halifax. We are pooling assets for the future.''
Detailed plans to convert the enlarged Halifax into a bank in 1996
will be announced in August. If approved, then the ten million members
will be entitled to a payout of over #600 each in shares in Halifax plc
when the bank is floated, probably in 1997.
That will be the third largest High Street bank in Britain and the
biggest by size of branch network. Its assets will be slightly lower
than those of Lloyds but ahead of the Abbey National and twice those of
the Royal Bank of Scotland.
It will have a market capitalisation of perhaps between #8000m and
#1bn. This merger is the second major shakeup in the building society
sector this year with the #1800m Lloyds Bank acquisition of the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester due for completion in August when the money is
paid over.
To qualify for shares, members must have had at least #100 of either
deposits or loans as of November 25 last year and to maintain balances
until flotation.
Halifax chief executive Mike Blackburn will be in overall control
while his opposite number on the Leeds board, Roger Boyes, will become
an ordinary board member and will suffer a pay cut.
National &amp; Provincial is at the receiving end of what is effectively a
hostile bid from Abbey National and is now in talks with several white
knights to find a more acceptable partner.
Other societies seemed destined for corporate action are Alliance &amp;
Leicester and Nationwide as well as Newcastle based Northern Rock.

THE Scottish Basketball Association have been hit with a fine of more
than #2200 fine by FIBA for pulling out of a European Junior Women's
tournament in Finland.
The SBA's technical director Ken Johnston is in Biarritz for an FIBA
conference where he hopes to lobby for some softening of the blow, but
FIBA have already turned down an SBA appeal.
The Scots were due to go to Tampere, in the north of Finland, but the
draw revealed no prospect of a meaningful experience, given the severity
of opposition. Coach Stewart Harris decided that the money would be
better spent elsewhere.
This is the second time in less than a month that Scotland have been
unsuccessful in an appeal to FIBA headquarters in Munich.
A request to reconsider the decision not to grant Paul Bjarnason an
international licence for this week's European Championship qualifying
tournament was also refused.
Scotland open their men's campaign in Lugano tonight and, ironically,
could be better off losing all games in the seven-team event. Their
first opponents Austria lost 74-58 to Iceland last night.
The bottom two teams will go on to play the likes of San Marino and
Gibraltar in the Promotion Cup in July 1996 and Ireland have already
proved that this can be a useful step to re-development.

South Africa
THE Tongan manager, resplendent in the South Seas equivalent of the
kilt, replies with olde world charm when he is asked how his side will
fare in the Rugby World Cup.
The Hon Tuivakano thinks for a moment before answering: ''We are going
to be trying our damndest.''
Tonga, the smallest of the 16 nations competing in the tournament, are
here in Pretoria where they are pooled with Scotland, France, and the
Ivory Coast.
They trained yesterday at the Pretoria Police College and, before the
Scottish media were requested, politely, to leave as they went into
secret session, the signs were that they are big, strong, athletic and,
as expected, have much more rugby nous about them than Ivory Coast.
The South Seas have, in recent seasons, become a source of valuable
raw material for Australia and New Zealand. Western Samoa now provide
the backbone of the All Blacks' side while the Wallabies' Willie
Ofahengaue is the ''Tongan Torpedo'' who was allowed to slip through the
New Zealand net.
Eleven of the 26-strong Tongan Rugby World Cup squad are regulars on
the tough provincial circuit in New Zealand and Australia, and are
familiar with hard, top-grade rugby.
Had it not been for the three-year ruling which ties a player to the
country of his adoption, then this squad would have been augmented, if
not by the All Black Jonah Lomu and Willie O, then certainly by the
three Tongans who have thrown in their lot, strangely enough, with
Japan.
Nevertheless, with a reasonably distinguished recent record in the
Southern Hemisphere Super Ten series and a tour to Japan -- which the
management say allowed the domestic and overseas players to make each
others' acquaintance -- Tonga are battle-hardened for the task ahead.
After France on Friday, the Tongans -- who perform the Sipi Tau, a
haka-like invocation to arms, before kick-off -- play Scotland a week
today.
Tonga were among those invitees who took part in the first World Cup
in 1987. They lost all three games, against Canada, Wales, and Ireland
and failed to qualify for the 1991 tournament.
Tuivakano says that so far as the Tongan Rugby Union is concerned, the
mere fact that they are here -- denying Fiji a place in the process --
represents a major achievement.
However, he believes that the strength of the squad means that they
could cause a few upsets.
''It is certainly not impossible that we could beat Scotland. The
Scots have been playing well, but remember what happened in 1991 when
Western Samoa beat Wales in Cardiff. Anything could happen. Like
everybody else, we will just be taking one game at a time.''
The Tongans are no strangers to South Africa as they were here in
March playing Orange Free State in the Super Ten series. They lost, but
honourably so, according to Tuivakano.
For the record, they lost their other Super Ten games, too, the
Queensland and Auckland encounters being closely fought, but that
against Canterbury turning into a landslide.
Scotland have played Tonga only twice before. In 1984 a Scotland XV
won 44-8 while on the 1993 South Seas tour, in a non-cap match, the
Scots played well to record a 23-5 victory.
Tonga have been eclipsed of late by their South Sea neighbours Fiji
and Western Samoa. Certainly, Fiji have made their mark in the
seven-a-side game while Western Samoa, although now perhaps on the wane,
were the big hits (in more senses than one) of the 1991 tournament.
Tuivakano believes that Tongan rugby is experiencing a renaissance.
''Rugby is still the biggest game in Tonga. There are 70 clubs and
nearly 2500 players. We have many players abroad and, in fact, we sent
players abroad so that they can gain experience. We are very proud of
players like Willie Ofahengaue.
''It is not a problem for us that they do not play for the Tongan
side. They act as examples to our young players and the fact that they
are in other countries gives our younger players the chance to make
their names.''
One overseas player who has ''come home'' is the captain and No.8,
Manakaetu Otai. He played for New Zealand Schools, Colts, and
Universities and was an All Black trialist from 1990-94.
The Tongans also feature one of the youngest player in the tournament,
Tupou College schoolboy Unoi Va'enuku, whose brother Tevita -- also here
in Pretoria -- is a relative veteran of 22 with 13 caps to his name.
Tuivakano rates highly the schoolboy, who was drafted into the party
only a few weeks ago. ''He played on the wing for us at the Hong Kong
sevens and so he has experience of big competitions. He is a good
prospect for the future and it is the future of Tongan rugby which is on
show here in South Africa.''

<HEADLINE>Upsurge in lucrative business travel. Record profits for British Airways</HEADLINE>

A COMBINATION of lower costs and economic recovery on both sides of
the Atlantic leading to an upsurge in more lucrative business travel
allowed British Airways (BA) to make record profits last year. It is one
of the world's most profitable airlines along with Cathay and Singapore
Airlines.
BA's profit before tax and exceptional items grew by 61.4% last year
to #452m. On the basis of the results the staff will receive a profit
share equivalent to just over three weeks basic pay at a cost of #66m.
Basic earnings per share grew by 31% last year to 39.3p. There is a
final dividend of 8.9p making a total for the year 12.4p a share, an
increase of 11.7% on last year's payout.
The airline beat its cost-reduction target by taking #160m of costs
out of the business during the year and expects to maintain similar
downward momentum on costs in the coming year. Continued emphasis on
customer service and marketing is paying off. Both the number of
passengers and amount of cargo carried were at record levels. The
passenger load factor of 71.6% was up 1.6%. There was 666,000 tonnes of
cargo carried in the year.
However there are some areas of the business that underperformed last
year. Most notably USAir although BA's chairman Sir Colin Marshall said
he believed that USAir was ''on the turn''. This follows news at the
weekend of tentative agreement with its flight attendants. Other labour
relations problems appear to have been sorted out.
A change in US accounting rules led BA to make a #125m provision in
its UK accounts against its #251m investment in USAir although this was
stressed as a technicality. BA remains convinced of the long-term
benefits that will accrue from its partnership with USAir.
The European airline market remains difficult and competitive with BA
having to operate in many cases with state-supported airlines such as
Air France. The fact that European air travel is not truly competitive
means that intra-European air fares remain scandalously high relative to
those in the US.
BA's strategic investments in France and Germany increased their
losses although BA refused to say by how much. Together they lost #90m
but BA is confident that remedial action taken in the year to
restructure the French business coupled with steady growth in the German
business will reduce the loss. Deutsche BA provides an important vehicle
into the emerging markets of eastern Europe.
Demand for BA's London-Paris and London-Brussels service was hit by
the launch of Eurostar train service which has proved popular with both
the general public and business community.
Investment is being made in new aircraft with capacity expected to
increase by 7% this year. Investment is continuing to be made in long
haul and Club class where margins are superior. In the current year new
long haul services will run to Oman and Beirut. In addition Caledonian,
its former charter airline subsidiary, will operate to new Caribbean
destinations such as Grand Cayman. In the current year BA intends to
increase its capacity by 7%, spending #1000m on aircraft.
Demand for air travel is very closely linked to economic growth.
Recovery in Continental European economies coupled with continued strong
growth in the UK, US and Asia/Pacific augurs well for the current
financial year. Going forward, IATA is forecasting 6.6% growth per annum
for the next four years which should see all the spare capacity in the
market used up.
The challenge remains to fill aircraft in the off peak periods in the
autumn and winter and continue to improve the operating efficiency of
the airline towards the target 22% return from cashflow as a percentage
of the net book value of assets. This is essential if profits are to
continue to grow because given the large number of competing carriers,
downward pressure on prices is likely to remain the order of the day.
Strategic alliances with major national carriers such as Australia's
Qantas coupled with selective investments in other airlines means that
BA is well positioned to take advantage of growing international demand
for air travel. It estimates that it received #50m of benefits from such
alliances last year. In contrast to many other airlines, its balance
sheet is strong with improving cashflows which makes it well placed to
take advantage of the many opportunities for investments worldwide.
City analysts were divided as to what the results meant particularly
the USAir provision but they were pleased with the better than expected
dividend. However after a see-saw rise the shares ended down 10p at 410p
where they yield 3.8%.

THE Dunedin Smaller Companies Trust drifted into the doldrums during
the six months to April as the rally in blue chips filtered through more
slowly to the bottom end of the stock market.
But Dunedin Fund Managers said the outlook for small companies was
good, particularly for those in manufacturing and engineering, which
account for half the trust's portfolio, and for those selling to export
markets.
Net asset value slipped 1.3% to 311p during the first six months of
the financial year, although the trust's benchmark FTSE Small Cap Index
(excluding investment trusts), was virtually unchanged.
The trust's income from investments rose 9% to #1.06m during the
six-month period, reflecting borrowings of #5m during the previous
financial year to gear up shareholder's funds to the same extent.
But higher interest charges and a fall in revenue from underwriting
commissions cut pre-tax income to #819,000 from #917,000 previously.
Earnings per share declined to 3.59p from 4.28p, but interim dividend
was held at 3p per share.
Trust manager Neil Pirie said the disappointing first half performance
reflected the trust's heavy investment in very small quoted companies,
which he said were traditionally slow to benefit from a rally in the
market as a whole.
Mr Pirie was optimistic about the second half of the year.

COMPANIES are being formed in Scotland at a faster rate than any other
region of Britain, according to a new survey.
The monthly report by Jordan and Sons, a firm which helps create and
register companies, shows a 42% increase in the number of firms formed
in Scotland last March compared to the same month in 1994.
The survey also shows a 57% month-on-month jump in the number of
companies created between February and March. The increase was
especially large in the Glasgow, Motherwell, Aberdeen, and Inverness
areas.
According to the survey, 859 companies were created in March, compared
to 544 in February and 605 in March last year.
Jordan's marketing director, Mr Geoff Wilcock, said there was a trend
towards faster company creation in all areas of the UK outside London,
but it was not clear why this was particularly strong in Scotland.
He said the faster rate of creation partly reflected an upswing in the
UK economy and an increase in management buyouts.
However, it was also a consequence of organisations contracting out
jobs such as cleaning and grass-cutting to people whom they had formerly
employed as staff and of unemployed people using redundancy payments to
start up their own businesses.
In Great Britain as a whole (excluding Northern Ireland), 13,845
companies were created in March, 10% more than the 12,590 created in
March last year, and 21.5% more than the 11,395 created in February.

WALES need more than just pride and passion to perform well in the
Rugby World Cup, according to their national coach, Alex Evans.
''We must get away from the idea of Welsh passion and start accepting
that we have to play with skill,'' he said yesterday.
''You don't need to teach anything about passion to the Welsh because
they are born with it, but sometimes it can be more harmful than good
because it can break down the skill factor.
''It happened against South Africa last year. Wales had the
opportunity to beat them. They went ahead. The crowd was giving them
great support and started singing and the players rose to it. But then
it went flat.''
Evans put his players through another gruelling training session which
is likely to signal a tapering off from the physical as the team builds
for their opening Pool C match against Japan on Saturday.
* NEW Zealand No.8 Zinzan Brooke is struggling to be fit for the All
Blacks' opening Pool C clash against Ireland in Johannesburg on
Saturday.
Brooke, a key figure for the 1987 champions, is struggling to shake
off an Achilles tendon injury, but the New Zealand selectors expect him
to prove his fitness before they announce their team tonight.
Canada have included centre Christian Stewart for their Pool A match
with Romania in Port Elizabeth on Friday, although he required four
stitches after having cut his foot on a tile climbing out of the hotel
swimming pool.
Both the Australian and South African camps are injury free three days
before their tournament-opening match in Cape Town.
* SOUTH Africa's build-up to the World Cup has been beset by worries
over the safety of visiting fans -- and embarrassment at the all-white
composition of the host team.
Hundreds of security guards have been hired to help to protect
supporters -- around 300,000 foreign visitors are expected -- from the
muggers and car hijackers who roam some of the nine venues, particularly
Johannesburg.
But police have assured foreign fans they will be safe despite the
country's reputation as the most violent society outside of a war zone.
The South African Rugby Football Association announced that they would
spend about #850,000 from World Cup profits on developing the sport
among the black majority.
Little or no money was spent on rugby facilities for blacks during the
decades of apartheid, which ended when president Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress won the country's first all-race elections in
April last year.

Glasgow's most important visual art initiative yet or a cheap way of
orchestrating a citywide event via volunteer labour? CLARE HENRY
considers the arguments for and against next year's festival
GLASGOW may havewon the hat-trick of garden festival, City of Culture
1990, and City of Architecture and Design 1999 but the accolade which
many think was most deserved, UK Year of Visual Arts 1996, is the one
that got away.
Determined to ''do it anyway'' and moreover give the official winners,
Newcastle's Northern Region, a run for its money, Glasgow's city fathers
are backing its own Festival of Visual Arts 1996.
It involves a programme of large-scale events plus a new visual arts
forum and a cash fund of #100,000. This contribution -- some would say
consolation prize -- could be the city's most important visual art
initiative yet.
Others are suspicious. Is it a sprat to catch a mackerel; a cheap way
of orchestrating a citywide festival via volunteer labour? Even if the
money is a sop, it's still an important injection of funds. ''Take the
hundred grand and run,'' was one reaction from the crowd of more than
200 who gathered for the launch earlier this week.
The fund is a one-off affair, limited to 1996. The forum will
hopefully last well beyond the money. The person spearheading both
schemes is Pamela McMahon, an unusual arts enabler. Not only does she
work out of Glasgow City Council finance department but manages to get
things done without ruffling feathers.
With 1996 on the horizon, she and her two assistants have been
augmented by three new, important civic appointments to co-ordinate the
1996 Visual Arts Festival: Wendy Knowles as 1996 development officer
with responsiblity for the #100,000 fund; Katherine Ross, marketing
manager, Glasgow 1996, in the tourist office, and Deborah Haas on
secondment from Glasgow Galleries. The overall aim is to market Glasgow
as a centre for the visual arts, ''and maximise tourist potential''.
The city already has one voluntary umbrella organisation, Glasgow
Galleries Group. Under new chairman John Heuston, it organises Glasgow's
Gallery Guide brochure and lobbies the press. How all these bodies will
work together remains to be seen.
McMahon has a good track record with broad-based art shows for she was
involved in setting up and programming Intermedia (a council-funded,
artists-curated gallery), which has proved to be one of Glasgow's
success stories.
''We hope for a similar, diverse range for 1996,'' says McMahon, who
as principal grants officer works with a total budget of #4.7m.
It began in 1991 as folk gathered to work towards winning the 1996
title. There was a genuine buzz; much talk of a forum and, after a large
meeting at the Burrell, volunteers were charged with setting something
up. ''It didn't work out,'' says McMahon.
''About 15 of us sat in sub-zero temperatures in the Sculpture Studios
with no-one knowing what we should be talking about.'' When Glasgow lost
the 1996 title (due to political rather than artistic reasons) the
impetus died completely, despite Pat Lally having committed Glasgow to
its own 1996 festival.
However the Scottish Arts Council had rashly promised to provide
#50,000 for Glasgow in 1996, conditional on the arts community having a
voice. Last year McMahon went back to the SAC. ''Does the offer still
stand?'' she asked. It took a while to get an affirmative in writing.
Then Glasgow District Council offered matching money. The result is the
joint initiative of #100,000, to be spent on Glasgow's independents, and
used to stimulate projects for 1996.
The forum's steering group has ''fought like cat and dog'' over the
fund's guidelines. It has also drafted a constitution. Steering group
members were nominated by 50 invited folk from the existing mini-forums
like Glasgow Print Studio, Open Circle, Glasgow Group, Fuse, the RGI,
and Wasps who proposed artist George Wyllie, photographer Martha
McCulloch, dealer Barclay Lennie, Barbara Gulliver of Art in Hospitals;
Jim Cathcart of Easterhouse Arts and sculptor, Sibylle von Halem, among
others. ''They've surprised me with their keenness.''
Membership is wide open. ''It must be broad-based. All persons with an
interest in the visual arts are welcome; we want a large membership.''
McMahon believes the forum must address wide issues; what the city is
aiming for on a global sense, not housekeeping trivia. Objectives
include ''the furtherance of the visual arts within the city of Glasgow;
placing artists on decision-making bodies; representing the interests of
individual artists, and acting as a lobbying group to promote the visual
arts.''
Will it change the world or is it just another talking shop? Von Halem
says: ''Even if it is, it's a shop we don't have right now. We'll have
an active group able to lobby and hopefully influence the existing
council to consider the arts in its policy-making for the new council.
It's exciting -- as long as everyone keeps the momentum going.'' Others
are less sure.
''Artists these days want a lot for nothing,'' observed one stalwart.
''They expect to be spoon-fed; have everything on a plate. Some even
demanded a minimum wage for their committee time -- plus travel
expenses.''
John Kraska believes artists are right to be cynical about the
initiative and warned against being over-optimistic. George Wyllie
points out that the city doesn't always put artists first, citing as
example its acquisition of the McLellan Galleries, effectively reducing
the exhibition space available for local artists today.
Artists' groups have been tried before. The Scottish Art Workers was a
recent effort which floundered through a lack of membership fees and
difficulties with administrative support. However this Glasgow forum,
backed by the council, is no home-grown affair.
Is the link too close? Is the council manoeuvring artists for their
own ends? Have artists sold out to the council by accepting their help?
Or is it a rare chance which should be grabbed with both hands? Time
will tell.
The #100,000 fund claims to encourage ambitious, imaginative art
events for 1996. Grants will not exceed 75%. Non-profit making
galleries, artists or groups can apply. Additionally commercial
galleries may apply where the project itself is non-commercial.
''We won't have application forms. They can be restrictive. We'll keep
it casual. People can tell the story in their own way. Applications must
be in by September 1, so that we can inform successful applicants in
October and have a proper programme ready to roll in January 1996. Time
is running out if the forum wishes to influence how the fund is spent.''
Decisions as to who gets the cash will be left to McMahon and Andrew
Nairne of the Scottish Arts Council. An artist from the forum will
comment on the applications.
Membership forms and committee nomination forms, obtainable from Art
Exposure Gallery, Parnie Street or the Finance Department, 0141 227
4068, must be returned by May 31.
* THE REAL UK Year of Art, budget around #80m, was launched last week
at London's Tate by Labour leader Tony Blair and Heritage Minister
Stephen Dorrell. It represents the UK's largest investment in the visual
arts. A Case for Capital, a report commissioned by Northern Arts looking
at #212m invested in the arts over five years, was launched at the same
time. The survey identifies 76 projects over #250,000. Of these 12 are
over #5m. A significant proportion of the #212m will come from the
Lottery.

GRAEME Souness scoffed yesterday at suggestions he is going back into
management with Turkish club Galatasaray only for the cash.
''It is not a case of going because of the money. Football is the most
important thing to me,'' said the former Rangers and Liverpool manager
whose one-year contract is worth around #500,000.
''I had no inclination of this. The approach came out the blue. I am
excited by it.''
Souness, who had a triple heart bypass surgery in 1992, is confident
he is fit enough to withstand the pressures that will go with the job in
such a hostile climate.
After training with the players yesterday he said: ''I feel great. ''I
played five-a-side and I enjoyed it.''
Galatasaray's general manager Adnan Zezein said: ''Mr Souness has
agreed to join us and the deal will be finalised today or tomorrow.''
The Turkish side, who have been a thorn in Manchester United's side
during the last two Champions' League campaigns, have lost their league
crown to Besiktas.

KUNICK are paying their first interim dividend since 1991, of 0.25p.
This reflects the board's confidence in the future after a period of
restructuring which is beginning to pay off.
Interim profits excluding exceptional items were 26% ahead at #3.9m.
Earnings per share excluding exceptional items jumped by 75.8% to 0.51p.
The balance sheet is strong with net cash of #5.8m.
On a divisional basis, leisure profits grew by 22% helped by a strong
performance in the UK. The National Lottery itself had little effect on
its business although scratch cards are having more of a negative
impact.
In the second half Kunick expects to see some benefits start to feed
through from its recent contract with Whitbread to supply amusement
machines on its sites. Kunick is market leader in the provision of
machines to the managed public house sector with 30% share. It expects
to benefit from growing demand for its amusement machines in the newly
liberalised market in licensed betting offices. Demand for its machines
in France was adversely affected by a change in the legislation.
In contrast the French non-food discount retailing business recorded a
50% increase in turnover helped by the opening of four new shops. Its
profits grew by 37% with growth held back by competitive pressuere and
high store-opening costs.

MOST of the VAT windfalls benefitting Scottish golf by some #10m from
tax wrongly charged since 1990 are now resting happily in club coffers
with the added benefit of club subs for 1995 having actually gone down
in many instances, but there are exceptions as witness the case of
Gullane Ladies.
By a quirk of the complex rules of VAT Partial Exemption, the
subscriptions of Gullane Ladies remain liable to VAT while those of the
men of Gullane are not, even though both share the same three courses
and the same clubhouse.
The reason, it seems, is this. Unusually, both clubs are separate and
have equal rights of play over the courses and their own rooms in the
clubhouse in addition to shared ones.
But for reasons of independence and administrative convenience, the
ladies pay directly to their own club, who in turn remit some 80% of the
total to the men's club towards running and maintaining the courses
after deducting their own individual costs.
Customs and Excise have viewed this procedure as one body paying
another -- not individuals paying a club which is a key principle in VAT
Partial Exemption -- and so the ladies are deemed liable for VAT.
John Taylor, secretary of Gullane Golf Club (men), said: ''We find it
very strange that this is the case when ladies who are associate members
of other clubs, and often complain they are second-class citizens, are
exempt.''
The men currently pay #225 annually, a figure that has been held from
last year, while the women in anticipation of VAT exemption, reduced
theirs by some #10 to #155.
Sources within Customs and Excise have indicated that the fact the
ladies' subscriptions are collected through a two-stage process is
incidental and that theirs should be exempt in the same way as the men.
However, the club has been told otherwise.

TALKING about Camelon turned out a treat. (Camelon was the topic here
last Tuesday, whatever smaller subjects had attention elsewhere.) Now
everybody, or nearly, has been talking about Camelon. It's time for
greatness made news.
All a bit of a change it was. Although the old village has been on the
map since before the ancient Romans took it over, Camelon's workaday
story has not been the stuff of headlines. Its way has been to stick to
plain toil. Among its useful works were lampposts and drain pipes. To an
indifferent world it sent creosote.
Camelon ceased putting its hand to such creations. Now what it has
made instead is a name for itself. To a story of hard work it added
glory. Its football team won no bother the OVD Junior Cup.
Camelon on the ball has not known a day so fair. Only once before did
it come close to coming first, and that was 43 years ago, and coming
close does not count. But on Sunday, at Motherwell's carnival Fir Park,
little Camelon beat little Whitburn 2-0.
It was a victory fearlessly forecast in this space; not that great
credit attaches to so precise a prediction. All it took was to listen to
some people who knew. The trick was to listen only to Camelon people who
knew.
Plucky Whitburn, called the Burnie, tonight at home will be hailed
formally for their good run in the tourney. Sunday was as close as they
have come to the cup since 29 years ago, when they took a worse
hammering.
But it's not true, as the lads on the back page sometimes like to
assert, that nobody remembers who comes second. It is a belief that does
not bear looking at. For Whitburn will remember.
Its bunting along the main street will be remembered. Flags were put
out. They had a singsong just the same. A gaudy cake decorated like a
football pitch was baked. One shop window was dressed with bravely bad
poems.
Why Whitburn is is because once upon a time it was a good place to
change horse on the shortest stagecoach route between Glasgow and
Edinburgh. Glasgow's influence remains stronger because after the Hitler
war some city people were decanted there. Officially it was called
Overspill. In Whitburn they cried it the Spillie.
It continues to be its own place. Even its climate is different. With
Harthill next door, Whitburn enjoys (wrong word) weather like nobody
else's. ''Cold and damp, though not unhealthy,'' reported a visitor in
1790.
Around that time Whitburn did textiles. Its 20 weavers shared four
pubs -- a social mix still going strong. Although main new buildings
include a public library and prominent swimming baths, it's hard not to
notice that the most conspicuous recent improvement is a glum police
station that appears to have been designed by an unknown survivor of the
Alamo.
Rumour insists that when the Burnie were improving the terracing at
their Central Park, they buried a whisky bottle for a time capsule.
First, though, members of the club committee tested the souvenir and
planted it empty.
Like Camelon's park, the Burnie's lies at the heart of the town. It
nestles among the houses. Where the Junior game has its playing fields
exemplifies how it is located right at the nation's heart. Its leagues
of teams called Rose, Bluebell, Violet, and even Primrose, are rooted in
the land's geography and not just its history. Small football clubs live
on, while about everything else around them has perished.
Both places which shared the final game have been sorely cuffed by
history. Few have had worse done to them. As Camelon has no foundries
left, Whitburn has no collieries. Instead of mining coal, it now mainly
manufactures jeans.
Ten years have passed since Whitburn was much in the news during the
last days of its last pit, called the Polkemmet. Flooding that was
allowed to happen during the seven-month miners' strike was turned into
an excuse for shutting it.
Locally, Polkemmet was called The Dardanelles, for reasons easier to
understand than why Camelon people describe themselves as the Mariners.
Work on digging Whitburn's pit started in the same month of 1915 as the
Dardanelles war campaign. Some of its sons fought there.
Small places which most of the time have had hard times show a
fondness for nicknames that some wise person might like to have a shot
at explaining. Perhaps inventing imaginative other names takes the rough
edges off real life.
In Sunday's final, the Burnie fielded a Kaiser and an Oscar, whose
parents called him Paul, along with a rugged defender who has been given
the title of The Hurter -- yet they still lost. But they were countered
by The Poet, who for mates alongside him had a Romario and a Tarzan.
Camelon also have a Skoosh, but he was left out. There is a Ph D degree
thesis in there somewhere.
Probably not the place for it, however, will be tonight's civic
reception for the Burnie in what were the town chambers when Whitburn
was a town with the burgh motto of Onward.
After the dunt they took on Sunday, getting on with things looks like
sage advice. Battle on! Keep doing the business! Going onward makes a
sound slogan. Of course it does, except that places like Camelon and
Whitburn have not been left with much to show for doing so.

IN matchplay, the flagstick is removed and placed on the green a few
feet from the hole and your opponent's misread putt is rolling
inexorably towards it.
Knowing that he would be liable to a two-stroke penalty under Rule
17-3 if his ball hits the flagstick, you sportingly leap for it and pick
it up just in time for the ball to roll by unimpeded. Do the rules
permit such an action?
NO. A flagstick, when removed from the hole, also assumes the status
of an obstruction. Rule 24-1 states that when a ball is in motion, an
obstruction which might influence the movement of the ball shall not be
moved. Similarly, Rule 1-2 forbids any action to influence the movement
of a ball except under a rule.
By the letter of the law your sporting gesture cost you the hole, and
in strokeplay your penalty would be two shots. Your opponent, or
fellow-competitor in strokeplay, is free from penalty (See Decision
1-2/3).
The penalty does seem harsh, but the moral of the story is to make
sure that when the flagstick is removed it is placed well out of harm's
way and, if not, move it before a stroke is played.

Prominent gay pop performer Jimmy Somerville talks to David Belcher
about the pain of growing up in a city with a small-town mentality
TALK to Jimmy Somerville and there's no escaping the fact that he has
not had his troubles to seek in living with the G-word. No, not gay . .
. Jimmy Somerville has no problem about being Britain's most prominent
gay pop performer, ta very much, chuck. Jimmy's bothersome G-word is
Glasgow.
Whenever they've been published on the pages of London's more liberal
newspapers, Jimmy's thoughts on his home town have aroused much prurient
and sensationalised tut-tutting in mainstream Scottish media circles. A
bad case of tabloid inflammation, you might say.
In having been candid about why he fled Glasgow at the age of 17 --
''Glasgow is a city, but it's one with a small-town mentality'' -- Jimmy
has been portrayed as an ungrateful traitor who cruelly spurned the
nurturing porridge and supportive purple heather of his happy hielan'
hame, which in Jimmy's case was Ruchill, one of the city's less
picturesque precincts.
''Actually, it doesn't matter to the papers why you left Glasgow,'' he
says in his manager's London offices. ''They never look at the roots of
the problems you had, and you simply end up being painted as
un-nationalistic.''
Such has been Jimmy's unpleasant experience of
trial-by-tartan-headline, in fact, that until now he has deliberately
avoided all contact with Scottish papers. However, 11 years after
Bronski Beat's Smalltown Boy blew the whistle on provincial homophobia,
Jimmy is willing to give The Herald a chance.
With a shrug of his shoulders, he admits that the juicier bits of what
he says to The Herald will probably be seized upon by other papers
anyway. He sighs. Now, at the age of 33, he actually wishes he'd been
able to keep his head beneath the parapet, and not publicly signal his
acceptance of his sexuality as early in his life as he did.
''It would have been better to come out later, at 23, say. By then I
could have got a proper education.''
Instead, Jimmy's education was much more rough and ready; much more
painful. And rather than opt for a quieter life these days, Jimmy keeps
the pink flag flying high by speaking out. His mission? That no young
gay man or woman should have to live his adolescence in ''an explosion
of confusion'' in the same way that Jimmy did.
''I definitely didn't have a happy childhood. I was aware of my
sexuality very young, at 11 or 12, and by 14 I was a mess. I was very
obviously gay, and I felt isolated, with no-one to talk to; no advice,
no direction. My life stank. I was stuck in the area I grew up in where
I was having sex with these straight boys who had girlfriends, and it
was getting me into a lot of trouble . . . from all these messed-up
closets in my street.
''Then one time, when I was 14 or 15, I went to see my sister off at
the bus station. She was going to see my elder brother . . . and when
she'd gone, I was propositioned by an older man, and had an encounter
with him.
''I suddenly realised that here was somewhere you could meet other gay
people. And so I ended up being passed around a nasty, twisted set of
older people who had undoubtedly been through the same process when they
were young. It was a form of mental abuse which didn't help my
self-esteem.
''I was in a vicious circle. I craved attention, affection, and
physical contact -- but I was left with nothing. Glasgow . . . I'd seen
a friend so hounded for being gay by the violent working-class community
he lived in that he killed himself.
''And yet when I went to Glasgow's one existing gay and lesbian centre
with the working-class gay friends I'd begun to discover, I saw evidence
of a class split. It wasn't the fault of the people who ran the centre,
but they were middle-class and they saw us as outcasts. 'Keep them out!'
some of them said about us, boisterous kids whose expressiveness wasn't
being channelled.
''As I'd been shy and intimidated at school, I began to let rip with
this new group who didn't judge me. I was a little shit. I remember
afternoons when we'd set up our own little gay centre in the toilets at
Arnotts. Until security threw us out, we'd chat there and intimidate
anybody who came in. We were on a downward spiral.''
So what did Jimmy Somerville do? ''I ran away to London. It was
cowardly, and it left people behind who were upset about me, but I was
sure at the time that no-one cared. I had a defence system which simply
meant me turning off all my emotions. I look back over me in my twenties
and think it's sad that that's what I did, but I don't have regrets. It
made me what I am . . . someone with a good mental grip on everything
that happens.''
Having drifted through a succession of nowhere jobs in London, it was
fitting that the emergence of Jimmy's unknown voice coincided with his
increasing policitisation. ''I'd been an apprentice baker, a shop
assistant, a prostitute. I've never liked bosses telling me what to do .
. . I'm too dizzy, and I don't take enough responsibility for myself, my
worst trait.
''But at 20 I found a gay and lesbian club, run by a bunch of Trots,
that wasn't solely about sex . . . it was about politics, opinions, art.
I became an angry young man, squatting, and working on video projects --
for one of which, Framed Youth, I had a poem. And the poem became
lyrics. And I started singing, and this strange, haunting sound came
out.''
It's only on his forthcoming poptastic-corker-of-an-album, Dare To
Love, that Jimmy has been able control his voice, he feels. So far
you'll have swooned to two examples of its improved lure on the singles
Heartbeat and Hurt So Good. Another album stand-out is Jimmy's version
of Diana Ross's Someday We'll Be Together.
''Lyrically, it's a loaded song for me, for gay men. It first came out
in the Vietnam war, and became addressed to soldiers. And, of course,
Aids has meant that never since wartime have so many men been dealing
with death.
''The song makes me feel good and makes me feel sad. So many people
I've known have become sick or are dead. I saw my flat-mate through the
process of death two years ago. He said he wanted his last rites read to
him by a shaman. I said: 'Where the hell are we going to get you a
shaman in Paddington?'
''It was my flat-mate's little joke. His way of showing us he wasn't
scared. So we weren't scared. I'm certainly less afraid of death. Death
is the pot of gold waiting at the end of the rainbow for everyone. I saw
my friend's last breath, and I know you draw a breath until you don't
draw a breath.
''I don't have HIV tests anymore, although I do have regular check-ups
from my doctor. Some people suffer terrible stress simply from finding
out they're HIV-positive. I hate to think of people reaching death and
saying: 'Why didn't I do that?'
''When I pop my clogs, it'll be: 'What didn't I do?' You simply
mustn't forget that eventually there is that last breath for all of
us.''
And until that day, how better to use your breath than in the way
Jimmy Somerville does? To create something musical and good.
* Dare To Love is released on the London label on June 12.

ONCE again, that maverick verse-maker and poet, Adrian Mitchell has
managed to kick some life into a crusty old text, Lope de Vega's
350-year-old drama of forbidden passion and honour revenged, El Castigo
sin Venganza, retitled Lost in a Mirror. Whether it's quite the moral
tract -- ''an example to us all tonight'' -- claimed for it at the end,
I'm not quite sure.
Yet strangely, some sense of warning does rub off for all that one's
sympathies are tugged less in the direction of the hypocritical Duke
whose honour has to be appeased than towards the two lovers -- his wife
and son (her stepson) who have enjoyed, if that's the word (there's so
much guilt and torment slopping around enjoyment seems rather low on the
list), a tumble in the sheets while the Duke has been away flexing his
sword in the wars.
Of course, there's rather more to it than that. Based on a real-life
event, it's also a steely, sinewy meditation on love, self-destruction,
and identity (a neat little twist finds Federico's spurned amour,
Aurora, actually witnessing the act of consummation through the
reflecting mirrors of Casandra's boudoir).
An act of pure dedication on the part of the tiny fringe company The
Other Theatre Company who've mounted this world premiere, director
Loveday Ingram's earnest production takes a while to hit its stride and
fails to exploit its irony.
But once in full swing, Mitchell's accessible, clever, translation and
compelling performances from Johanna Benyon and Paul Ansdell as the
lovers, David Brett as a delightfully jocular Burl Ives of his day, and
Lucinda Raikes as the jealous -- and like Casandra -- manipulated
sweetheart keep us riveted. Obsessive love kills. Now where have we
heard that before?

The effect of Robert Lepage and Strindberg meeting head on is to bring
a reality, albeit a dreamer's sense of reality, to the stage, as Mark
Fisher describes
WHEN someone had the bright idea of inviting Robert Lepage to direct
August Strindberg's A Dream Play in the bosom of Sweden's theatre
industry, they didn't get quite what they bargained for.
On paper the combination had a neat logic to it. Take one impossible
play, a sprawling piece of stream-of-consciousness that was considered
completely unstageable for a good six years after its first publication,
and match it with the golden boy of the international avant-garde, a
director prone to sinking Shakespeare in so many inches of mud or
producing mammoth productions about continental drift. Strindberg and
Lepage together would surely be thoroughly hallucinatory bedfellows.
Or so went the theory. ''We thought that he would confuse things --
make it even more subtle and strange,'' says Peder Bjurman, producer at
Dramaten, Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre, explaining that Strindberg
is to the Swedish theatre what Shakespeare is to our own, and that it
does no harm to have him re-evaluated every so often. The 200-year-old
Dramaten has a commitment to staging the classics, and at the theatre,
where Ingmar Bergman is the artistic director, you can expect A Dream
Play to be dusted down at least once a decade.
''Everybody knows A Dream Play,'' says Bjurman, admitting that Lepage
did the very opposite of what they expected. ''But up to now I don't
think they understood it. It is quite amazing that a Canadian can come
to Stockholm and explain Strindberg. His production suddenly makes the
play appear in a new way, it makes clear what Strindberg's intentions
were.''
Lepage himself is no less bemused by his success. It's true that his
directing career has been remarkably varied. As well as his own devised
shows like The Dragon's Trilogy, Tectonic Plates, Needles and Opium and
The Seven Streams of the River Ota -- all of which have been seen in
Glasgow -- he has directed everything from a Bartok opera to Shakespeare
at the National to a Peter Gabriel concert tour. But Strindberg, he
felt, was as far from his theatrical and cultural experience as you
could get.
''When I ended up in Stockholm, I expected it to be difficult,'' he
says from his Quebec City apartment. ''But I was there to learn. After a
week of work I was completely haunted, not only by the author and the
world of the author, but also by the fact that I could completely
recognise myself in this guy. I was surprised because Strindberg has
always been associated with craziness and baroque thought -- but on the
contrary I discovered an author and a world that were extremely coherent
and clear.''
Far from confusing the issue, the effect of Lepage and Strindberg
meeting head on is to bring a reality, albeit a dreamer's sense of
reality, to the stage.
''The best dreams you remember are completely real,'' says Bjurman,
''and this is what Lepage's aim was -- to make it real. Not to have the
actors acting like they were in a dream but to make it completely
realistic or normal.''
Normal, that is, apart from the fact that they are balanced
precariously in a three-meter cube suspended above a pool of water and
spinning on a tilted axis so that in the whole three-hour performance
they never once stand on a level surface. This by all reports is
Lepage's real coup. A set change in this production is when the floor
becomes the wall and the wall becomes the ceiling. The actors have to
crawl, dangle, and hang just to stay on stage.
The staging symbolises many of the themes that preoccupy both
Strindberg and Lepage, looking as they do from opposite ends of the same
century.
''Suddenly in my life most of my friends and people I'd been hanging
out with happened to be Buddhists,'' says Lepage. ''I wanted to find out
what's in this philosophy, what makes it so adaptable, why it is still
around. It happened that I was doing A Dream Play and it gave me a lot
of answers. For me Buddhism was an important starting point to
understand the play.
''At the beginning of the play the central character Agnes asks the
glazier why flowers grow in horseshit and he says because flowers don't
like the smell so they grow away from it. In the first page of the book
of Buddhist philosophy there is an image of the lotus flower that grows
in a swamp; the more horrible the swamp the more beautiful the lotus.
It's the idea that out of chaos comes beauty, logic, life. I tried to
elaborate the whole staging from that idea.''
Lepage is about to go public with a parallel career as a film director
when the David Putnam-produced Confessional opens the Directors'
Fortnight at Cannes.
''I've had offers from Hollywood producers, but that's not what I'm
going to be doing,'' he says, preferring to make small-budget films with
his own production company.
Any prospective producer should also note that their protege director
is just as likely to be devising his next one-man show or jet-setting
round the world to launch the latest version of The Seven Streams of the
River Ota, as he is to be concentrating on film.
But, like the man says, from chaos comes order. ''The converging point
for all these projects is that now I'm based in Quebec City,'' says
Lepage. ''I used to be based all over the place, but now I'm in the city
the company comes from. The mayor gave me a hall and I'm getting money
to develop it into a lab. It's very exciting.
''Over the next few years we're going to be doing all these
multi-media things that I'm building right now. That changes the
perspective a lot. So even if there's a lot of stuff on the make, now we
have a tool and I don't have to be chartered all over the world. Now
everything is done in my kitchen!''

DAVID BELCHER reports on how a hilarious natural history programme was
hatched
SQUAWKIETALKIE is the logical title for a TV show ostensibly narrated
by its animal stars. Making its debut on Channel 4 at 8pm tomorrow
night, Squawkietalkie is also a hilarious natural history programme
which deftly sends up the po-faced mien of most other natural history
programmes. Ennngh, the show's original title, would not have been as
good a name. Especially as its creators, Pete Baikie and John Sparkes of
C4's famed Absolutely Celtic comedy sextet, insisted that it could be
pronounced only by holding your nose and emitting a duck-like honking
noise. Making folk laugh: it's no joke.
Done properly, it can be a sobering experience, too. Squawkietalkie
was hatched in a pub, you see, but it was forced to straighten up and
fly right before finding a nesting-place on prime-time TV.
''It began as a quiz show with rounds called things like What Shat
That?'' explains Edinburgh laddie Baikie in the Absolutely
comedy-combine's three-storey London offices. ''Then John and I did the
most awful pilot show as two David Bellamy-Attenborough characters.''
C4 were unimpressed with both format and presenters, but they were
mightily taken with Sparkes and Baikie having added funny new narrative
voice-overs to a wealth of vintage natural history footage, thus
transforming perambulating cockroaches into policemen; gibbons into
stand-ups; penguins into detectives.
It wasn't easy, of course. ''We've sat through at least 2000 hours of
old film, beginning with monochrome footage shot in Africa in the
twenties. Beak-sync'ing was a tough, time-consuming process, too.''
Beak-sync'ing?
''As opposed to lip-sync'ing . . . synchronising our new voice-overs
with on-screen beak movements.''
Channel 4 love Absolutely sufficiently to have commissioned a fifth
series, due to be filmed later this year. Other Absolutely projects
include Jack Docherty's Mac for BBC Scotland; John Sparkes Unplugged
(''the usual cocktail of filth and Welshness'') for C4; Dancing, a
Tartan Short directed by Stevan Rimkus, and Mellow TV for a cable
operator.    Additionally, Pete has been crafting music for Vic Reeves
and Bob Mortimer's forthcoming quiz show, Shooting Stars, while
Hollywood has fallen completely in love with Absolutely's Morwenna
Banks.
''Our own Cornish sexpot is in a film with Christopher Guest, of
Spinal tap, as well as Saturday Night Live and Dream On. And one or two
people might have noticed our own oafish bampot, Gordon Kennedy,
presenting the National Lottery draw.''
Final words on Squawkietalkie? ''Sophisticated, high-class, adult, and
Pinteresque comedy.''    No it's not, thankfully. It's a hoot. It's
wild.

Youngsters are being treated to top-quality entertainment in
Edinburgh, reports MARK FISHER
THERE'S a very big secret being kept down in Inverleith Park. But they
surely can't keep it in for much longer. There's a queue outside the
gate before 10am, the sell-out shows run back-to-back all week, and
there are no disappointed customers.
And the secret -- on the strength of my first day's show-hopping at
this year's Scottish International Children's Festival in Edinburgh --
is that our school-age theatre-goers are getting a quality of
entertainment that, in its ambition, imagination, freshness and spirit,
time and again eclipses what their mums and dads are being served up at
night.
And with the announcement yesterday morning that Visible Fictions, the
Stirling-based children's theatre company, is to receive the first Bank
of Scotland Young People's Theatre Award -- a cool #10,000 to put
towards a production to be premiered at next year's event -- there are
strong indications that Scottish artists will continue to provide fair
competition for their well-funded rivals from abroad.
Visible Fictions, which is represented this year with Giant Steps,
plans to spend its award money on a new production of Pinocchio. The
cash injection means work can start straight away on the project, which
will be produced on a larger scale than normal and will benefit from a
healthy six-week rehearsal run.
The thing that hits home after a day's worth of children's shows,
aside from the professional standards and high commitment from all
concerned, is the sheer range of work on offer. It's as though the
demands of a young, open-minded audience encourage performers to let
their imaginations wander far beyond the parameters prescribed by the
boring old grown-up world.
So we get the Canadian company Theatre Sans Fil with The Crown of
Destiny performing a slick, high-tech, large-scale puppet show which
indulges in the current North American fascination with all things
Celtic in a thoroughly absorbing, time-travelling tale of good queens,
evil princes and creepy underworld goblins, elves and ogres.
Compare that to the home-made simplicity of fellow-Canadians The
Robert Minden Ensemble and The Boy who Wanted to Talk to Whales -- a
beguiling combination of narrative and music performed on bottles, saws,
tin cans and scrap-metal that will have you rushing home to find your
own whales to talk to.
A quick dash into the Happy Tent where the Happy Gang, a trio who do
for primary colours what Siouxee and the Banshees did for black, refuse
to take themselves too seriously on many a tuneful adventure for a
younger audience.
Then there's the US's Fred Garbo, plus sidekick dancer Daielma Santos
-- a jumped-up and pumped-up street performer with an amazing way with
inflatables. His act varies from knockabout comedy to sublime visual
poetry -- you'd never imagine there was so much enjoyment to be had from
watching large and colourful objects float across the stage.
Finally to Scotland's Hullaballoo, with a simple staging of some of
Aesop's Fables, performed with a breezy fluidity and a sense of humour
that suggests the company knows its audience well.
I'm not claiming these shows are beyond criticism -- Crown of Destiny
is so polished and hi-tech that it loses some intimacy; The Boy who
Wanted to Talk to Whales demands quite a mature level of concentration
and it's a shame the kids didn't get to rattle those sticks; there is
more than just inflatable padding in Fred Garbo's show; and Hullaballoo
lacks the precision and clarity that makes Communicado's Tall Tales for
Small People (also performing here) such a delight -- but I didn't sit
in a single audience that wasn't utterly captivated nor did I see a
single performer who wasn't doing it for the kids. Essential.

ACROSS the road at The Pavilion, we rue missing The Show They Never
Gave, allegedly starring Roy Orbison, Elvis, and Buddy Holly. Here at
the concert hall we have the merely mortal, multi-platinum,
multi-siblinged (she has 13 brothers and sisters) sound of FM radio
personified, Celine Dion.
One wonders, however, if Dion's backing musicians have found the
correct venue. The music is played perfectly, so perfectly, by the
hairiest bunch of backing musicians ever assembled. The drummer sounds
unnaturally programmed, the rhythms mechanical, and only Dion and her
three impressive backing singers give some degree of life to the
proceedings.
Dion herself, improbably thin and wearing a waistcoat that looks
implausibly like a Dunfermline Athletic top, shows off her sparkling
wedding ring and smiles constantly. At least she is a star of some
charisma, and in possession of a super voice, which for the most part is
controlled in such a way as to highlight its full range and subtlety.
Unfortunately she still comes across in parts as a Eurovision Mariah
Carey, a low-budget, cabaret Whitney Houston. This is because of the
songs, a collection of ill-advised cover versions cast among mid-tempo
mediocrity sparked only by the odd majestic ballad like If You Ask Me
To, and the hit singles Where Does My Heart Beat Now, and Think Twice.
The ironic twist comes in the encore: I Can't Help Falling In Love
With You, part Elvis, part Pavilion, and almost all Las Vegas, the sound
of a great voice in search of an equally good writer or record
collection.
Power pop at its most harmless and charmless.

THE pleasures of cruising along the information highway are coming to
be more widely appreciated. The Herald is already available on CD-ROM
through a joint initiative with the Scottish Council on Educational
Technology (Scet). Now its expertise on CD-ROM technology and
understanding of the market have enabled the Scottish Vocational
Education Council (Scotvec) to make information on its 3700 National
Certificate modules available to users on a single CD-ROM disk.
It has been to more than 1300 centres -- schools, colleges, community
education centres, industrial companies, and private trainers -- which
can now get access to information on any Scotvec module at the touch of
a button. A detailed instruction manual is incorporated into the disk.
The new system has been developed in response to the needs of
Scotvec's customers, since the volume of paperwork previously sent to
centres on large numbers of modules could be daunting. The new
arrangements will not only reduce the paper mountain, but will also cut
administrative corners.
According to Scotvec's head of administrative services, Neil MacGowan,
module descriptors have not in the past been issued direct to centres
but issued to regional authorities, from which centres could request
copies of specific descriptors. This procedure has now been omitted. The
CD-ROM disks have also been issued free by Scotvec, just as module
materials were previously made available to centres in hard copy without
charge.
The process of preparing comprehensive information on 3700 modules for
inclusion on disk was a massive one, co-ordinated by one of Scotvec's
administrative officers, Sandra Watson. The result is impressive.
Teachers can now select and print out quickly the specific sections of
module data which they require at any time.
Before starting the design process, Scotvec had undertaken a wide
consultation exercise which revealed that the overwhelming majority of
its centres would welcome the new system. The 1300 disks have now been
sent out and there have been only a few objections to the initiative.
An evaluation will be undertaken in next month, mainly through a
centre questionnaire which will be designed to elicit views on ease of
access and any desirable improvements. Thereafter, the CD-ROM disk will
be updated annually, starting in January 1996.
New National Certificate modules are always coming along and the next
batch will be included on the 1996 disk. In the meantime, centres will
be sent details of the next set, categorised by occupational areas, and
will be able to obtain hard copy on request.
The success of the CD-ROM venture seems assured. Scotvec is certainly
displaying its own confidence by proceeding with plans to extend the
initiative to its Higher National units. Information on these will also
be transferred to CD-ROM. On the information highway, traffic just keeps
building up.

OWZAT? Well, I wasn't exactly bowled over. This is a Bill Kenwright
and Rod Coton production of the original stage version which inspired
the contemporary -- and, apparently, award-winning -- television series
of the same name. First presented at the Hampstead Theatre 16 years ago
Richard Harris's drama about the behind-the-scenes domestic scenes at a
village cricket game is a tame little comedy of manners which pussyfoots
around the same middle-class preoccupations which Alan Ayckbourn
over-analyses, but lacks Ayckbourn's redeeming wit.
The dialogue is dated and pedestrian and most of the characters are
strictly one-dimensional -- from the drawling, bitchy beauty to the
boastful yuppie solicitor and his socially aspirational girlfriend, an
Essex girl called Sharon who shows up dressed for a day at Ascot, in Bo
Peep bows and frills. The gravelly-voiced Gareth Hunt is a box office
draw but fails even vaguely to flesh out his cardboard-thin role of
Dennis, a chauvinistic, lecherous carpet salesman.
The plot revolves around standard devices -- a case of (unfairly)
suspected marital infidelity and a genuinely dodgy leg-over from the
whiter than white cricket captain, Roger, efficiently played by Julian
Holloway. He and his put-upon cheesey wife Miriam are a bog-standard
farcical couple, although Diane Bull breathes some fire into her role,
practically rousing cheers from the audience when, discovering Roger's
off-side rogering, she scatters orange peel around the ground in a
defiant act of rebellion.
It's disappointingly short-lived -- a potential ''worm who turns'',
she opts out and sticks to the marital straight and narrow. A touch of
realism in an otherwise hyperbolic portrait.

AN air of paranoid delusion having been set by a screening of
Portishead's own stylish short movie, To Kill A Dead Man, last night's
mood was decidedly noir: claustrophobic, smouldering, on the edge of
collapse. We were trapped, possibly in an old episode of The Prisoner,
Diana Rigg-era Avengers or Man In A Suitcase. Or maybe we were all in a
scene from Cabaret, band and audience inescapably united in the seedy
complicity of a pre-war Berlin bar, with everyone aware of their own
impending doom.
Portishead's drummer lagged laconically behind the beat. Locked
grooves were scratchily spun from a pair of turntables. That primal
electronic device, the theremin, keened in its unearthly fashion.
Trumpet noises were deployed in ironic counterpoint. There were
elliptical bass rumblings; Adrian Utley's slow and spacey
guitar-loopings washed over us. Oh aye; the Portishead life is a
frigging cabaret, old chum . . . with vocalist Beth Gibbons as our
hectoring, raunchy Sally Bowles?
No. Her one conversational gambit with the audience was a nagging,
neurotic one: ''Anybody out there got a cigarette I could cadge?''
Lankily slumped round the mike in a nicotine haze, she resembled a
de-tuned Francoise Hardy.
Elsewhere, particularly during Glory Box, she was an updated Billie
Holiday for the ambient, post-hip hop generation, chewing out lines of
desperate weariness. ''I'm so tired of playing with this bow and arrow.
Give me a reason to love you, give me a reason to be.''
Portishead simply stopped after 40 minutes on stage, having exhausted
their one-album repertoire. No-one could complain. Movies are much
bigger than life-size after all.

THE other week I made a blast to the past; I downed tools for two days
and went on a pilgrimage to Lochaber, the district of my birth. The
weather was good, the company congenial, the landscape most beautiful.
But every apple has its worm.
Corpach, where a vast pulp mill arrived almost at the same time as
myself -- swamping the community with imported labour and much
unpleasant building -- is today a sad and demoralised place. The mill
closed 14 years ago, an early casualty of Thatcherism.
The great jetty at Annat is rusty and derelict. Much of the plant
ashore has been demolished, leaving ugly concrete floors where once
there was bustling prosperity. The tourist trade is in steep decline;
unemployment, and all its associated ills, is high in Lochaber.
We stayed at a very expensive hotel, the first night. There we chatted
up two very pleasant waitresses. They told us they were paid #1.87 an
hour for a working day which started at seven in the morning. The hotel,
of course, provided them with room and board. Its cost was deducted from
their pitiful wages.
We took a hurl to Mull, and drove the long and bleak road from
Craignure to Fionnphort. Mull is a desolation. Bare glen succeeds bare
glen; a pretty holiday cottage stands here and there, where once --
many, many years ago -- there were large communities. Mull, last
century, was savagely cleared by MacLean of Duart, ''improved'', and put
under sheep. As Hugh Miller said bitterly of Sutherland, it was
''improved into a desert''. Mull is a desert still.
We reached Iona and found no less than nine huge touring coaches
parked at the ferry. The contents of these -- predominantly ancient
''oop north'' tourists, with a sprinkling of loud Americans -- had
seized Iona for the day. Most of them milled about a cheap cafe, or
bypassed the abbey to stalk grimly towards a concrete ''visitor
centre''. Iona's sacred ruins proved an alien market-place. There was
much vainglory: plaques, monuments and a ''book of honour'' to such
great benefactors as Sir Hugh Fraser and a past Duke of Argyll.
The abbey, to judge by its furnishings, was given over to the most
vacuous and dreadful kind of worship: a high altar, candles, banners,
and all the excesses of cheap Anglo-Catholicism. Naturally, it boasts a
rip-off shop. In this, the visiting Christian was invited to buy naff
and dated soft-left literature -- books of South African protest hymns,
Patience MacStrong platitudes, something called The Tao of Pooh. There
was little here of rugged Columba, the godly warrior; little but
compromise, effeminacy, and the fudge of fashionable doubt.
Beside the abbey is an old graveyard, and near its corner -- with a
dignified little monument of bronze -- is the grave of John Smith, who
was buried just over a year ago. The first anniversary of his death has
been generally ignored. Smith was one of our ablest politicians. But for
the 15 years of his prime, his talents were spent in opposition and
futility, because he refused to abandon the logic of Union. John Smith,
in his life, achieved little of substance. That was his tragedy, and
ours.
These are some good reasons for voting SNP generally and, should you
be a voter in Perth and Kinross, voting this Thursday for the SNP and
Roseanna Cunningham specifically. They include, of course, motives and
thoughts both rational, emotional, and plain eccentric.
But my little tour showed me, yet again, a lovely landscape at present
hosting a debauched and bitter nation. We are a land refusing to grow up
and take on the excitement of adulthood. Until we do so, Scotland will
remain a holiday park, all its ills to be laid at the door of others.
I have only met Roseanna Cunningham once, at the end of last year, but
I thought she was super. She is strong, confident, and clever; she
speaks her mind; she is impossible to ignore. When Roseanna reaches
Westminster we will hear a good deal more of her. She may well be the
first SNP MP successfully to defend her by-election win in a General
Election. I would not be at all surprised if, in a half-decade or so,
she were seriously placed to lead the party.
Storming the streets of Perth, she leaves the other candidates in
eclipse and disarray. The poor Tory, John Godfrey, is a teacher's pet
who has forgotten his jotter. Veronica Linklater -- would you have
believed such folk still existed? -- suits the hockey pitch, not the
hustings. And then there is Douglas Alexander. Do you think there will
be time after the polls for the laddie to sit his Highers?
You might have expected the Tory to tout the Union, Labour to thump
the Tories, the Lib-Dems to bash the electoral system. Instead, of
course, they are all bashing Roseanna and the SNP. As far as Godfrey is
concerned, the plebs may vote for anything but. As far as Linklater
goes, talk of separation is too beastly for words, and Scottish
unemployment has a ready solution; everyone should have more servants.
And wee Douglas and his big pal Tony declare that there are no no-go
areas in Scotland for the Labour Party. Well, we have had 50-odd Labour
MPs for the past eight years, and the rape of Scotland has continued
apace: it is hard to see that one more could make any difference.
Here are five good reasons for you Fair City people to vote SNP on
Thursday. First: the Nationalists alone can beat the Tories, and every
little helps; every seat wrested from this wicked Government is a nail
of doom in the Conservative coffin.
Second: the Nationalists alone have the interests of Scotland at
heart. They will not suborn her interests to Westminster power-games, or
talk electoral reform and lentilburgers as public housing rots,
factories close, Trident ticks away on the firth, and our culture slides
into the sea.
Third: a strong SNP win prevents our little land from being taken for
granted. A Labour win in Perth and Kinross would be the worst thing
possible. Blair has shown little sensitivity for Scotland, and his
commitment to home rule lacks conviction. The stronger the SNP, the more
alacrity with which Labour pursues Scottish interests.
Fourth: it is tactically important that the SNP regain some toehold in
central Scotland; they are too readily dismissed as the party of the
rural north-east, and Perth is eminently lowland, rather mainstream.
And -- fifth -- you should vote for Roseanna Cunningham because she
has character and wit and judgment; she has a radical heart and a
formidable brain, and life with Roseanna in our politics will prove
great fun.

THE direction of Labour Party economic policy is becoming clearer as
first Mr Brown, and now Mr Blair, lay before us some of the parameters
which will define their approach in government. It has become common to
say that there is little difference on economic policy between Labour
and the Tories. There is some truth in this. The present state of the
British economy, despite the improvement in export figures, is such that
any party in government would find itself in a straitjacket of
exceptionally unyielding construction. In a key speech yesterday, and in
deference to these overwhelming realities, Mr Blair stressed that a firm
control of inflation would be central to the economic approach of his
Labour government and that it would not be sacrificed in a rush to
stimulate growth. This means that he intends to pursue a monetary policy
every bit as stringent as that of the present Government. By doing this,
he believes, the proper framework will be set for the deployment of
other measures, such as investment, infrastructure improvements, and the
promotion of industrial training, all of which will expand the economy
and lead to safe and sustainable growth. There are three pressing
questions which spring from this approach, only one of which Mr Blair
seems even halfway inclined to answer.
The first concerns the detail, as opposed to the broad brushwork of
policy. Fleshing out policy with figures, especially in relation to the
general economic framework in which he intends to work, is something
which Mr Blair wishes to avoid. It is reasonable to argue that it is
impossible to give detailed figures two years before a General Election
and without seeing the books. But the concerned electorate, and those
business and City figures which Mr Blair seeks to impress, are aware of
the impossibility of detailed figures but convinced that putting some
numbers to framework policy is perfectly possible, indeed necessary.
Doing this would help to answer the second question, which is in what
ways Labour Party policies on the economy differ from the approach of
the present Government. Mr Blair will be acutely conscious that some
members of his party will be unconvinced by an economic programme which
is in many respects so similar to that of the Government. This does not
worry him. He is convinced that a tight monetary approach will bring
benefits in the form of support from both the City and the electorate.
This is the way he wishes to approach the next election.
Why, then, should anybody vote Labour? That is the third question, and
unless it is answered in some detail the Labour Party could find it
difficult to retain its present support. The difference should be in
social policy. It is not sufficient, though, to talk about this in
pastel terms. Nor is it good enough to outline an economic policy
without connecting it umbilically to social policy. Economic success is
not a goal in itself but is, rather, a means to an end, which is the
promotion of as much human happiness as is possible. This is a universal
truth, but it is one which is not much heard in either Tory or Labour
circles these days. Let us also have some creative thought on the
subject of economic democracy, which concerns everyone and is not just
the preserve of boardrooms or shareholders. And while we are at it,
where are the signs of thinking on new forms of public enterprise?
Economic rectitude is important but it will not win an election on its
own, nor does it deserve to.

Alexander McKenzie reports on how our teacher education measures up in
world terms
WHICH country has the best trained teachers? Is it Japan, South Korea,
or any of the other education-obsessed societies of East Asia? Might it
be Australia, New Zealand, or one of the other vibrant countries of the
New World? Could it possibly be England or Scotland?
No. The answer, according to a detailed American analysis of the
world's finest teacher training programmes, is Germany. The combination
of demanding academic requirements and rigorous classroom teaching
practice ensures that teachers in Germany are among the best prepared,
and the most competent, in the world.
Before embarking on their two-year-long training programmes Germany's
student teachers have to attain degree-level passes in two academic
subjects.
The high standards demanded by the training authorities mean that
students have thoroughly mastered their teaching subjects before
learning about pedagogic matters and undertaking many months of teaching
practice in schools.
During their school placements students are visited, observed, and
assessed more than 20 times by their course tutors.
Once their teaching practice has been completed Germany's student
teachers have to endure final ''professional'' exams which involve a
combination of written papers and oral tests to make sure they are fully
aware of current educational developments.
''Germany's rigorous teacher-training programmes help to ensure that
students are truly capable of taking on full-time jobs in the
classroom,'' says Petra Voigt, a parent of two teenagers in Koblenz. ''A
competent body of teachers is the country's most valuable asset.''
German society recognises the endeavours of its teachers by providing
a generous package of rewards including high salaries, low-interest
mortgages, and job-security.
In spite of a national cash shortage, Russia also demands a high
standard of training for its student teachers. The country's
teacher-preparation programmes are among the world's most rigorous
involving, in many cases, four or five-year courses with numerous exams
and long stints of classroom practice.
Russia's student teachers are also encouraged to show their commitment
to children by volunteering to help out at the country's network of
youth camps.
Japanese student teachers, meanwhile, display their enthusiasm for
extra-curricular activities by acquiring the sort of skills which will
enable them to help out with the after-school clubs and sports that are
organised at the end of every school day in Japan.
In addition young teachers are required to continue with their
training programmes once they have actually been appointed to schools.
The Ministry of Education in Tokyo decrees that Japan's new teachers
receive a minimum of 20 hours of out-of-school training during their
first year in teaching.
These in-service training programmes are staffed by experienced
teachers who have been seconded from their posts specifically to help
new teachers develop their classroom management skills.
The high pay and status guaranteed for teachers in Japan help to
attract a steady supply of talented and highly-motivated students to the
country's teacher-training programmes.
In the US, by contrast, there is considerable concern about the low
status of teachers and the standard of the training they receive.
A study of American teachers' skills a few years back revealed that
many of the teachers employed in American schools are unable to write
proper sentences or solve simple mathematical problems.
Low status and low pay, it is now accepted, mean the American teaching
profession often fails to attract the best graduates from the country's
colleges and universities.
In Europe a similar concern about falling standards has produced a
spate of new ideas for teacher training programmes.
At the start of the 1990s France closed all its regional teacher
training centres and established new training colleges attached to
universities. The overhaul of the country's teacher training programmes
introduced more exacting entry requirements and provided more practical
classroom training for student teachers.
In Italy, where teachers have traditionally been recruited without
much formal training, there are also moves to set higher academic
requirements and to provide a more comprehensive training programme to
prepare students for classroom work.
In England the Department for Education has established a new Teacher
Training Agency to promote teaching as a profession and to take
responsibility for dispensing funds for teacher-training.
The TTA was set up in response to the criticisms that too many
teachers did not know their subjects well enough to teach effectively
and that the teaching of the 'three Rs', in particular, was being
neglected.
Scotland's teacher training centres, however, have a more favourable
reputation for training students to high standards. Nonetheless the
limited amount of classroom assessment which many secondary school
teachers receive has been criticised and, in response, the Scottish
Office is about to introduce a scheme which will involve students on the
one-year postgraduate course spending more time in school, and less at
college.
Secondary teachers will act as mentors who will supervise, train, and
assess them in the classroom. But some critics say longer courses, as
well as more classroom training, are required to strengthen the system
and to help ensure that the teachers who eventually make it to the
classroom are of the highest calibre.

IN some parts of Scotland as few as 5% of senior pupils go on to
university. Dick Louden looks at two initiatives to encourage young
people to stay on in education
THE fourth BP Scottish conference on student tutoring -- held in the
magnificent new St Margaret's Academy in Livingston -- was the
celebration of one of education's success stories of recent years.
Through BP's generous five-year sponsorship -- about to come to an end
-- it also reflected the huge potential for partnership between the
public and private sectors.
The project uses volunteer student tutors, from universities and
colleges, as role models for school pupils, with the objective of
interesting them in further or higher education. The tutors, from varied
subject backgrounds, support teachers and pupils across the curriculum
for a half-day per week for 10 to 15 weeks. Student tutoring is also
extending into some primary schools, aiming in particular to interest
from an early age pupils from families with little or no involvement in
higher education.
The Scottish director of the BP project, Kneale Johnson, told the
conference that the initiative now involves 12 universities, 14
colleges, 1000 tutors and 15,000 pupils. Since 1991 expansion of pupil
and student numbers has been of the order of 2000% -- clear evidence of
the benefits which student tutoring is seen to offer.
The Scottish coordinator is Joe Hogan, BP Student Tutoring Fellow, who
pointed out that tutoring is only one of seven innovative projects
sponsored since 1990 by BP in a #1m package under its Aiming for a
College Education programme.
Liz Reid, Lothian region's director of education, told the conference
that she regarded student tutoring as ''a method of adding value to the
quality of the learning experience''. She cited the example of
Castlebrae Community High School in Edinburgh, from which no pupils have
entered higher education for a number of years. ''Now they have student
tutors,'' she said, ''and several pupils are actively considering higher
education''.
She praised the students for their commitment of time and saw the
experience they gained as making an important contribution to their CVs
-- a theme echoed by many delegates, including students themselves.
Lothian region operates, in conjunction with Edinburgh University, the
University Special Entrance (Use) Initiative -- about to be re-launched
as Lothian Equal Access Programme for Schools (Leaps) -- which runs an
outreach programme in 15 schools. The Use co-ordinator, Elspeth Turner,
and students from the university work with teachers and careers staff to
heighten pupil awareness of the benefits of higher education.
One group of students, whose pioneering spirit attracted much
favourable comment at the conference, have set up their own student
tutoring society, devoted to organising activities which bring pupils
and students into contact in relaxed settings, thus encouraging pupils
to widen their social and cultural horizons and to seek informal advice.
The expansion into primary schools was described by Cathy Morrison, a
senior teacher at Carmyle Primary in Glasgow, where student tutoring has
operated for four years. She saw it as entailing certain problems.
Because of holidays students were unavailable at the start of the school
session. However, the school could harness their expertise and
enthusiasm, and could offer individual tuition to some pupils. Above
all, many pupils for whom higher education was an unknown quantity had
role models to emulate. The very presence of a student was valuable in
itself.
Indeed, the benefits of student tutoring for pupil and student alike
were not in question. There was solid agreement within the conference
that, even without the pump-priming funding generated by BP, local
authorities and others, the scheme should now be integrated into the
system of schooling.
Only one issue evoked diverging views at the conference -- should
students receive formal accreditation for their work?
Jim Wood, co-ordinator of the Tyneside Students into Schools Project,
which plans to accredit around 150 students this summer, sees the main
advantages as the official recognition accorded to the students'
contribution and the funding it can attract, since accreditation will be
through an NVQ module at level three. He accepts, however, that
accreditation could bring in students for the wrong reasons and that the
danger exists of yet another addition to teacher workload.
The debate about accreditation may fade away but student tutoring most
certainly will not. It is motivating more young Scots to continue their
education and training beyond school, and that will ensure its future.

SOME weeks ago in California Lady Thatcher stood before a delirious
throng of rich old things, the Reagan pals known otherwise as powerful
Republicans with ambitious wives. Perhaps a little more fatigued about
the face, she remained, nevertheless, emotionally changeless, tireless.
She still wore that regal smile of yesteryear and the no-surrender
hairdo, and as Charles Wick, her host, eloquently cited her ''unique''
friendship with the ailing ex-President of America as one which had
changed the course of history, the baroness inclined her head in
gracious acceptance. It was a classic performance in the hoodwinking art
of politics, and that night there was hardly an unmoist eye in Beverly
Hills.
The United States is now Margaret Thatcher's natural platform. Its
people identify with her work ethic of rising early and working late,
but more than that her son's Texan marriage -- although it might be
unravelling -- has served to bestow on the mother a sort of honorary
American citizenship.
But Lady Thatcher's sense of theatrics also finds an obvious home in
America, as does her recitation of simplistics. No-one doubts her
affection for Ronald Reagan: he taught her that politics and show
business are often interchangeable, a fact now evident in the marketing
of her latest memoirs which resembles the hype surrounding a carefully
packaged movie-star biography.
So, like some veteran character actor who requires the lifeblood of a
public stage, she appears, off Downing Street, to remind us that
Margaret Hilda Thatcher remains the most influential woman of the
century. And, as with any great trouper, the timing is flawless: here,
in yet another hour of Government need, she emerges from political
widowhood to strike the hands that felled her.
Much to their chagrin, the Cabinet are forced to respond, knowing that
her hectoring lustre mustn't be allowed to swell the Tory back benchers'
mutiny or again dominate the European agenda.
HER hapless protege, John Major, might put an affable face on all of
this, but uncertainty dwells in his eyes, for he knows that when the
lights are on her -- even from the distance of California -- Lady
Thatcher can summon all her bravura and defiance to signal: ''I am still
more potent than you.'' This may well be fantasy, a symptom of the old
Thatcher stubbornness, but with the relevance of the Major premiership
already in tatters, this latest attack, however much now mutually
dismissed, must seem like sabotage: a war cry to her foes, a promise to
her friends.
It is no secret that Lady Thatcher has found adjustment to the
shrunken vista a slow, agonising process. Even now, four-and-a-half
years after she was ousted, she often appears to be in a flailing
turmoil about eviction from the job she still sees as hers alone.
Yet in office this was the Prime Minister who had always lauded the
domestic arts, had always spoken excitedly, if incongruously, about her
skill with drapes. It proved a gentle deceit but one which she believed
expressed her common touch. However, six months after being booted out
of No 10, she reflected bleakly: ''Home is where you come to when you
have nothing better to do.'' There, in one sentence, she had exposed the
real Margaret Thatcher. Throughout her long career she had resolutely
demonstrated quite masculine aggression, and that characteristic doesn't
simply drain away from the genes with retirement. It seeks new goals
and, if unable to find them, it meddles.
The trouble is Lady Thatcher made too many European and Commonwealth
enemies to emerge now as a significant roving ambassador. So what is
left is her uneasy sojourn in the Lords, where she and fellow peers view
one another with poised contempt. Or else there is the business of books
and America's wealthy lecture circuit, but even here she feels Major has
mucked it up. She may pull the crowds among a certain generation, but he
has ruined her special relationship with the White House, where Lady
Thatcher counts for little among the Clintonites.
But there are times, like this week, when it seems that nothing has
altered. Groomed to perfection, the arms widening outwards as if to
dispense a benediction, Blessed Margaret is on the road to
self-canonisation, a road which, with this volume, she calls The Path to
Power. Yet there are changes. Under the weight of crude Conservative
greed and scandal, the image of the definitive Tory lady is being
elbowed into the archives. Around Westminster the hawkish costumes and
unbreachable coiffure are already part of history. Even so, that pushy
handbag still hangs, like the curse of Damocles, above her protege's
head.

THE enthusiasm with which members of the Leeds and Halifax building
societies endorsed their proposed merger yesterday should be sufficient
to give the lie to those managers of two big mutual societies who last
week dismissed recent trends in their movement as ''a fad''. The fact is
that the building society movement is at present subject to intense
pressures which will not quickly disappear. The catalyst for the change
has been the emergence of the banks and other (sometimes new) financial
institutions as major providers of mortgages, but it has also been given
a thrust forward by events in the housing market these past five years.
These have abruptly ended the assumption that home ownership is an
automatic escalator to (tax free) capital gain. The sticky housing
market is still overhung by some hundreds of thousands of homeowners
deterred from selling by having mortgages greater than any likely price
(so-called negative equity). Even the fact that prices have generally
fallen well below previous peaks (except in Scotland, where they have
held up better) has not stimulated sales as much as would have been
expected. Sentiment will have been damaged further by the claims
advanced in last night's Panorama programme that a long-term trend,
spanning perhaps as much as two more decades, is likely to take house
prices down by almost another third in real terms.
The move away from mutualisation cannot be dismissed as a fad. Mergers
are bound to take place in the movement which still has too many small
and medium-sized societies which are not conspicuously efficient. The
advantages of mutuality are fast diminishing: it is simply not true that
they include cheaper mortgages because mutuals pay no dividends to
shareholders but transfer surpluses to reserves. The performance of
Abbey National since becoming a plc has been to combine growing
dividends to shareholders with fully competitive mortgage and deposit
rates; and there is no reason to believe that the merged Halifax and
Leeds will be different. Unless the mutuals are to find themselves
losing depositors they are going to have to re-think their attitude
about sharing surpluses. In fact all building society depositors have
had a poor deal since 1945 when inflation has steadily transferred much
of their savings to borrowers' rising house values. The changes now
giving depositors (and borrowers too, as it happens) a little unexpected
bonus is in the case of the former group a belated act of justice.
Whether the gloom of Panorama's conclusions is justified will soon be
obvious. But even in a low-inflation environment the cost of new houses
will rise steadily and that must impact on the second-hand housing
market, the existing stock. A house will still have attractions, as will
borrowed money secured on it, though the subsidy implied by mortgage tax
relief will be greatly reduced. That reduction has been one of several
factors in the housing market which have worked heavily against the
present Government. Those responsible for the attempt to eliminate Miras
have been singularly unaware of likely unfavourable political
repercussions. It is easy to see why such a change would appeal to the
Treasury, whose job is to save expenditure and boost revenues. And there
was a good intellectual case for diverting spending on housing into the
rented sector. But Chancellors have a more complex remit, needing to
balance political, social, and economic needs. As with VAT on domestic
fuel and the attempt summarily to close most of the remaining coal
mines, this Government has behaved as if utterly bereft of political
''savvy''. No wonder Mrs Thatcher is distressed.

Fancy a job that's a cut above? Eric Kennedy met a young lady all set
to make a stylish living
STYLE is part and parcel of Diane Harley's life, and she wouldn't swop
her lifestyle for anything.
Not that her job, as a senior stylist at a Glasgow South Side hair
studio, pays all that much. It's just that she meets a lot of people,
gets to know her customers, and derives satisfaction from what she does.
''It's a good feeling, knowing you have done a good job,'' she says.
''Mind you, some of the requests you get can be funny. One chap asked
for 'a sort of pointed upside-down inverted mushroom'. He got it.''
Diane entered hairdressing in 1984 as a junior, at the studio where
she now works. She spent three years training on the job, going to
Glasgow College of Commerce on day-release once a week. This was paid
for by her employer.
She learned beauty culture (eyebrow plucking, pedicure, manicure,
facials) in the mornings and hairstyling in the afternoons. It was all
practical, and the girls practised on each other and on the public, who
were getting hairdos at a fraction of the normal price. They weren't
taking much of a risk, as all work is done under supervision.
At the end of these three years she passed her City &amp; Guild exam, then
got a job in a Shawlands salon as a junior stylist. She went on to be a
stylist in a Battlefield studio, and five years ago rejoined the
original Clarkston studio, where it had all started, as a senior
stylist.
Her career had followed the normal course although nowadays, she says,
youngsters are encouraged to take part in training schemes such as YT or
go to a training college.
She herself doubts whether the training there is any better than
learning on the job but it is another route into the business.
A junior works her way through the various skills -- shampooing,
putting treatments on hair, putting in rollers, and handling perms and
colours. A senior stylist cuts, blow-dries, perms, and does colours and
highlights.
She is in a good position, then, to notice changing styles:
apparently, short hair is in for summer, and the permed look is not as
popular as a few years ago.
A senior stylist can also seek wider horizons, perhaps through setting
up her own hair studio, or going into TV or theatrical make-up, or
teaching at one of the training colleges. For the moment, however, Diane
Harley is more than content with her lot.
''You get to know your clients, and when they are feeling a bit
down,'' she says.
''You find out exactly what they want done with their hair, and make
sure they get what they want. That usually cheers them up.
''I can't really think of another job where I would meet so many
people.''

WHEN he wasn't in front of sundry microphones yesterday defending his
boss from the slings and arrows of outrageous Thatcher, Michael
Heseltine was launching the Government's second Competitiveness White
Paper in a year in the Commons.
Competitiveness is the President of the Board of Trade's current big
idea. One hundred and sixty three pages last year. Two hundred and
thirty five pages this year. In terms of the paperwork, this is a very
big idea indeed. And getting bigger.
With little left to privatise, the drive now is to turn more UK
companies into world-class competitors. In his introduction to the first
White Paper last May, Prime Minister Major wrote: ''Today our companies
face the most competitive environment they have ever seen. Change is
relentless and swift. The global financial market never sleeps.
Technology has shrunk the world. Free trade has opened new markets but
it has also created new competitors. We cannot ignore these changes. To
do so means certain decline.''
Blunt message. And, in a rare shaft of political realism since,
Heseltine has conceded that, while some British companies are indeed
world class, we simply don't have enough of them to maintain our
aspirations in the world. So Competitiveness White Paper Two is designed
to keep up the pressure and encourager les autres.
Although Ministers appear less than sanguine about our current
competitive position, I doubt they would endorse the strictures of
arch-competitor Rupert Murdoch, in a rare television interview with
BBC's The Money Programme this past weekend.
Asked if he accepted his image, for many in Britain including MPs, as
an over-powerful media baron, Murdoch thundered: ''Anybody could have
set up Sky Television. Anybody. And we started it and people are still
free to compete against us.
''But they'd rather write articles, bitch and moan, lay around and say
no, we'd rather just keep our lazy way of life, we don't want to
compete. It's not until we get people being equally entrepreneurial and
really driving at it that Britain is going to get going again.''
For Murdoch, then, Britain's lack of competitiveness comes down to a
fundamental attitude problem. We've lost the hunger to compete.
Complacently dreaming of old glories, we've become voyeurs as others
roll up their sleeves and pitch in. If pressed on the point, I suspect,
Murdoch's disdain for the British establishment would burst through. Our
attitude problem, he would argue, starts at the very top.
But that begs the question of what attitude or mix of attitudes is
most conducive to competing effectively in the modern world. A few weeks
back former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil was recounting, over dinner
in Glasgow, his experience of working for Murdoch. Neil recalled one
Saturday, some years back, when he was immersed in editing his paper,
but Murdoch kept on phoning to find out the latest news on an imminent
communications satellite launch.
Eventually an increasingly irritated Neil pointed out he had a paper
to get out. Why did this obscure event matter anyway, he asked.
''Andrew,'' came the terse reply, ''I've bet the company on the success
of that launch.'' To compete, in that context, is to take risks. And
taking risks demands, inevitably, the psychology of the seasoned
gambler. Murdoch undoubtedly gambled on the success of Sky, just as he
is gambling now on the success of Star, its counterpart in the Asia
Pacific region.
But is a willingness to gamble, and gamble big, the whole story? The
blue bloods of Barings gambled, by proxy, through Nick Leeson's
derivatives trading. But, it appears, they failed to inform themselves
of the nature of the risks their trader was running in these new-fangled
markets. As long as his successes kept them in the style to which they
had grown accustomed, Leeson was given a freer and freer hand. Until the
whole house of trades crashed down and Barings had to be baled out by
the Dutch.
While Rupert Murdoch may be a global gambler, he certainly can't be
accused of being ill-informed about his companies or his sector. He has
printers' ink under his fingernails. So the risk-taking, in his case, is
leavened by deep knowledge of the business environment in which he
operates.
You will search in vain for this kind of analysis in either of the two
Heseltine White Papers. There is plenty about management and training;
about innovation and fair and open markets; about finance and
infrastructure. Acres of worthy words. There's barely an acknowledgement
of the role of risk-taking, let alone a willingness to bet a whole
company on this or that outcome.
The nearest the analysis gets to that is in an intervening document,
Winning, which bears the imprint of both the DTI and the CBI. It
directly analysed the characteristics of more than 100 of the best UK
companies, asking the question: What makes them better? What makes them
able to compete successfully?
Such companies are, it tells us, led by ''visionary, enthusiastic
champions of change''. Not people who manage change. But people who are,
through the way they lead their companies, the essence of change itself.
And high on the list of ingredients in that kind of leadership is a
willingness to take meaningful risks.
But that's not the whole story. Successful companies both know their
customers and learn from them. They know the competition too and are
constantly innovating in both products and services to outwit them.
Critically, in the words of Winning, the best companies unlock the
potential of their people, creating a culture in which they feel
empowered and valued. ''You can feel it the moment you enter a
competitive company,'' says the report. ''There is a buzz that suggests
confidence and success.''
IN too many British companies in recent years, the people have seen
themselves as an expendable cost, not as a key resource. The buzz, like
the feel-good factor, has been almost entirely absent. Too many top
managements, far from being visionary champions of change, have been
preoccupied with managing relative decline. In the worst examples, they
have been guilty of monopolising the (financial) lifeboats as the ships
went down.
Changing all that around will take more than two massive White Papers,
groaning with detail, but devoid of fresh vision. Yesterday's Scottish
launch was marred by microphone problems. 'Tis said the new Scottish
Office mikes are voice activated. Could it be that the message was so
bland, even the silicon chips found it a turn-off?

THERE are student tutors, and there arestudent mentors. Mentoring has
the same goals as tutoring but with one important difference, the
mentors do not assist teachers in the process of delivering the
curriculum in classrooms.
The mentoring scheme, which is being run this year by Glasgow
University, is one of 12 imaginative new projects financed by the
Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. As with student tutoring, the
scheme aims to encourage pupils, especially those who would otherwise be
unlikely to consider university as a realistic option, to think
seriously about it.
Each of the 17 Glasgow schools involved in the project has its own
team of volunteers: a university lecturer plus two undergraduate
students, normally from the second and third years of their courses.
Through regular visits to the school, the team informs pupils about
university life, the courses, the fun, and the problems. The youngsters
can also attend a Summer School designed to introduce new students to
university and how it operates.
Mentoring is about passing on the sort of information which cannot
readily be picked up from reading prospectuses -- What is a degree? Why
are there so few lectures in a day? It is all about breaking down
barriers and convincing young people that a university need not be a
forbidding place, and that you can both study conscientiously and enjoy
a good social life.
The coordinator of the Glasgow University project, Dr Kevin Francis,
takes the view that, ideally, the two students would be former pupils of
the school in which they are mentoring. For St Mungo's Academy in the
east end of Glasgow this presents no problems -- 11 out of the current
34 mentors were pupils there.
The headteacher, Tom Burnett, is very positive about the benefits of
student mentoring, his only regret being that the students are not
available in August and September when senior pupils are in the process
of preparing their university application forms. John Tully, principal
teacher of guidance, sees mentoring as increasing pupil motivation and
enhancing social skills and self-confidence.
However, most pupils have at best a conditional offer of a university
place when they enter sixth year. They therefore feel they need another
mechanism apart from mentoring to enhance their prospects and that is
where summer school comes in. ''It is popular with our pupils,'' said
assistant head teacher Tom MacDonald.
''As well as preparing them for university life, it makes all the
difference to some in terms of gaining entrance. Many marginal cases are
admitted on the basis of summer school reports. Indeed, some lecturers
say they place more weight on these reports than on SCE results.''
St Mungo's sixth-year pupils found the mentoring scheme an
illuminating exercise. ''The mentors began with a general talk to the
year group, then we saw them on a one-to-one basis,'' said Monica Tinny,
hoping to study biology at Strathclyde University. ''My sister is
already at university and the mentoring helped to confirm my thoughts.''
Martin Docherty, aiming for a place in engineering at Glasgow
Caledonian University, found most value in ''the general view of the
university which they gave us. They presented a picture of what life
there was like.''
Natalie Ann Ross, who wants to study public administration, probably
at Glasgow Caledonian, comes from a family with no previous involvement
in higher education. ''I realise now that it's the only way to get a
good start in life,'' she said. ''The only thing is, it would be better
to break the ice by meeting your mentors when you're younger.''
Paul Gilmartin, whose ambition is to take engineering at Glasgow
University, praised the mentors for their encouragement. ''I didn't know
anything about university,'' he said. ''They told us it was both hard
work and good fun. They explained things like student finance and the
loans system.''
The two mentors at St Mungo's are both former pupils of the school, in
the third year of their courses at Glasgow University and from families
with no history of higher education.
James Reid, studying politics and social policy, had enjoyed
demonstrating to pupils that universities were not ''bastions of
elitism''. Michelle McGuckien, about to sit her final exams in social
science, viewed the project as ''an experiment which needs more time to
develop. It would be good to get involved further down the school. James
and I went along to the third-year parents' evening.''
Michelle is an ideal role model for the St Mungo's pupils. ''Glasgow
University is the only place I ever wanted to go,'' she said. ''When I
was little, I drove past it, saw the tower and knew it was the place for
me.''

Geraldine Abrahams finds a workshop with a dual approach to training
COMPETING in the commercial marketplace is difficult for any firm in
today's business environment, and is especially hard when an essential
part of its work involves training its workforce and equipping them with
more than just commercially-based skills.
The prime purpose in setting up Seaborn industries, a training
workshop of the Strathclyde Branch of EAS (Epilepsy Association of
Scotland) in 1957, was to help people with varying mild disabilities to
work towards securing employment in an integrated workplace.
It operates a Training for Work workshop at Govan Road with qualified
trainers and the appropriate equipment to train in upholstery, joinery,
spray polishing, picture framing, and office practice, offering training
at the present time to SCOTVEC Level 2.
Given the high-quality workmanship and the potentially marketable
skills, the way forward for Seaborn in 1995 would seem to be dual
purposed: to continue to offer the training and support for its
trainees, while at the same time operating a commercially viable
enterprise.
Archie Gray, who is working as a consultant within the organisation at
the present time, would like to see the role of the workshop expanded.
''We have found in the past that people leaving here having been
through the training process, still find it hard to get into a
work-based situation,'' he said. ''We want to create our own work-based
situation out there in the community, to create a positive flow of
people and opportunity, helping them to build up enough confidence to
set up a business themselves or go into a work situation with much more
confidence than they have had in the past.
''It isn't easy for people coming from a workshop environment into a
workplace situation, either for the employer or the individual. These
trainees are capable of turning out a commercial job but it is a matter
of convincing employers. This would be a step towards that.''
To this end, Seaborn Industries has entered into discussions with
Community Enterprise, looking at future possibilities in terms of the
workshop's commercial activities.
For companies in the general marketplace, the conflict of interest
between meeting the needs of all the trainees and making a profit might
cause insurmountable problems. But Seaborn hopes to go forward with
plans that will lead eventually both to the profitability of its
potential commercial arm while at the same time safeguarding the
training opportunities of all trainees.
''The people here work at their own pace, in their own time,'' says
manager Jim Clark. ''There is a comradeship which all helps to build up
confidence. Some have small physical disabilities but despite that,
there are employers who see the words 'disability allowance' and
envisage problems, and will tend to choose an able-bodied person rather
than a disabled person.''
This is trainee Richard Winters' second year on the programme. At the
moment he is working under the guidance of trainer Stephen Toye,
re-covering a 60-year-old armchair for an air stewardess.
''For the first year I worked on smaller types of chairs, and modern
upholstery, but now I have moved on. This is my second year and I am
still finding it quite difficult. The variety is unbelievable and it
takes years to learn, but it is great to feel you are actually doing
something. We see the finished product and it is very satisfying,'' said
Richard.
He has already achieved City &amp; Guilds Level 1 and is now working
towards SCOTVEC Level 2, and hopes that the standard qualification will
give him a better chance of a job.
Stephen Toye feels that they are achieving a great deal in terms of
quality: ''We work at a slow pace which is good for training purposes
and cover a broad spectrum of upholstery. We tend to get the quality to
a good standard, and don't let anything go until it is right. Apart from
learning the craft, there is a very important social interaction here.''
Seaborn does not advertise for work. All of the orders they process
have been personal recommendations. In the joinery workshop, it is
commonplace for a customer to walk in with a drawing of what they want
and this can then be custom-built.
Trainee John McDermott, also working towards SCOTVEC Level 2 has been
building traditional wood-carved fireplaces to order. Completed in two
days, these are commercially viable products, and this ability to meet
individual customer specifications is an obvious strength.
A recently completed chest of drawers was also built to a customer's
specific requirements. ''The customer ordered a 'two over four' drawers
set which was made out of medium-density fibre and then taken into the
paint shop and coloured. After it was finished he decided that he wanted
a mirror to match on the top. We had all the measurements, so we built
that on.
''Some of the newer lads might be a bit slower but people like me who
have been on the course before are building up skills all the time.''
John has found age as one of the biggest problems in getting a job,
even with his newly acquired skills. He had previously worked for 33
years as a sales rep.
John's trainer, George Pozzi, who has experience in training
apprentices and YTS before the Training for Work scheme, explained the
processes involved in the training: ''Everybody starting here gets basic
work to do and then they are assessed on that standard. Those who are
assessed as being able to do more advanced work will go on but everyone
will achieve something.''
Through in the picture-framing section, trainees Hugh McMillan and
Robert Buchanan are putting the finishing touches on a framed set of
mementos celebrating the Centenary of Cathcart Castle Golf Club. The
skills here also owe a lot to the hands-on approach which operates at
Seaborn.
''There are different levels of work here, whether it is picture
framing, tapestries, or other work for businesses,'' said Hugh.
''Working with the machines is fairly straightforward, so it is a matter
of fitting the frame to individual customers tastes. It is very much a
matter of learning by watching each other, seeing how mistakes are made,
and learning from them.''
With SCOTVEC up and running, the workshop should be able to operate
more independently. In terms of setting up a commercial enterprise, the
present system of funding would be prohibitive, but given that the
trainees, the equipment and the systems are already in place, the change
over would appear be a relatively simple process.

I HAVE just come up from my new home in Oxford for another of my
alarmingly regular visits to my Glasgow dentist. Like the Second City's
doctors, surgeons, secretaries -- and taxi drivers -- Glasgow dentists
are the best, and mine, Mr Innes Grant, is the most tolerant one,
willing -- he alone, I'm sure -- to take on an ever more taxing labour.
When he has done me yet again my Smiles are, indeed, Miles Better.
At Preston, a group of Motherwell steel workers boarded the train.
Their animated informed conversation, fortified by a few cans of lager,
did much to relieve the tedium of a long and uneventful journey. One of
them gave me a copy of The Herald (May 18) to read. I was very pleased.
I've not found your paper on sale anywhere in Oxford.
As usual it contained several lively, skilfully and wittily written
pieces. I particularly liked Margaret Vaughan's and Brian Meek's
articles. Margaret Vaughan excelled in her treatment of a bemusing and
semi-salacious and topical item, that of ''promiscuous genes'' which she
handled with impressive aplomb and a touch of anti-male-chauvinist
wordplay.
The writer adduces the fruits of the labours of an Oxford geneticist,
who studies the relative weights and sizes of testes among primates,
ranging from the lightweight gorilla's and the more than heavyweight
chimp's -- ''relatively enormous'' in the less than admirable idiom of
the anonymous Glasgow geneticist who has mediated the Oxford one's
remarkable findings and made them available for Herald readers.
If promiscuousness stems from the size of testicles, as the geneticist
says it does in support of the foolish and hapless Bishop of Edinburgh's
easily misquoted statement on the subject, then we have quite a lot to
ponder about.
Women don't come into the debate, promiscuity being assumed to be a
male-only instinct. Women go in for adultery, no doubt partly because
they don't have comparable things suitable for weighing and measuring.
Russians don't acknowledge that it is a one-gender thing. Their word
for it is a totally two-gender thing -- promiskuitet. And there is more
proof that they are members of the Great European Family Group. The word
is not Asiatic in origin.
My recently acquired Russian wife, who hails from Yalta, in the
Crimea, constantly nags me to move back to Glasgow, because of the
better weather, the hills, the rivers, the sea -- and the soft clear
water as against the lime-infested variety that passes for fresh water
''dahn South''. And I haven't taken her to Rabbie Burns' Cottage yet!
Wives have wily, potent powers of persuasion -- so who can tell?
Mr Dave Stewart in his letter (May 18) makes an eloquent case for the
study of European languages other than French. He goes beyond Europe,
listing Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, and Russian as major non-European
tourism and trading languages that we ought to become familiar with.
All well and good. But here is the fly in that otherwise impeccable
ointment: Dave Stewart committed that all too common error of thinking
that Russia is not in Europe. It is in Europe, Russians are Europeans,
although the Nato/EC operators seem cannily to pretend that it isn't and
they aren't.
In this Mr Stewart is regrettably not alone. I recently booked an
airline ticket from Heathrow to St Petersburg in the Oxford office of
Thomas Cook. Their flight officer was enviably competent with her
computer, whereas her ignorance of the whereabouts of European countries
other than France, Italy, Spain, etc, was an eye-opener.
When she charged me an excessive amount for the insurance, she
explained that that amount is the ''non-European'' rate. She wasn't too
sure about Finland either -- I'm flying by FinnAir, via Helsinki.
The Motherwell steel workers are shortly going to Taiwan to teach the
locals there how to make steel. Another good instance of Scottish
internationalism.

THE following sounds like a classic apocryphal story but we have an
assurance that the two chaps involved, from Partick and Saltcoats
respectively, do exist and the events actually happened.
The two Scots are on a holiday in Australia and are driving through
the outback when their car is in collision with a kangaroo. They stop
and find the kangaroo lying lifeless by the roadside.
They prod it a bit but there is no sign of recovery. At this point,
and it is because of the next bit that they wish to remain anonymous,
they prop the kangaroo against the car and proceed to take some
photographs.
One of the chaps goes even further and dresses the unfortunate
kangaroo in his denim jacket to take some more snaps. At this point the
kangaroo comes to life and realises, even in its dazed state, that these
two lunatics are people well worth avoiding.
The kangaroo bounces off at great speed into the Bush, still wearing
the denim jacket with the chap's wallet, traveller's cheques, and other
important documents in the pockets.
Full marks to American Express who replaced the traveller's cheques
once they had stopped laughing at the details of their disappearance.
Claymore cliches
ONE of the advantages of the current crop of Scottish movies is that
it will help educate the rest of the world about our nation's history
and culture. Like in the review of Rob Roy which appeared in the
Financial Times which spoke of John Hurt's ''drawling Monmouth''. This
will come as a surprise to all of us who thought it was the Duke of
Montrose who was the baddie.
Our old chum and man of many long words, Pat Kane, had a few words to
say about these clutch of claymore movies. He told Guardian readers:
''What's so bad about big-hearted Scottish action movies, set in the
distant, mist-wreathed past? Simply that part of Scotland's long-term
disempowerment has been cultural, as well as economic and political: and
the nation as an elemental land of warrior men and wan maidens, of
breast-beating heroes fighting the overly-rational English is the most
disempowering cultural image of all.''
What a great day it was for Scottish intellectual life all those years
ago in Coatbridge when somebody told Pat to be a good boy and eat up his
dictionary.
Roar deal?
THE Times, a London periodical which used to be a newspaper of record,
lived up last Saturday to its new status as the cheapest blatt in town.
In its coverage of the case of Anthony Williams, the accountant who
stole #5m from Scotland Yard and bought Tomintoul, it reproduced the
coat of arms which he had done as part of his baronial lifestyle. In its
report it said his baronial device was ''still registered at the Court
of the Lyon King in Edinburgh''.
Obviously they meant the Court of the Lord Lyon, King of Arms, and not
the Disney film with a very similar name. Mind you, at 20p a copy, you
get what you pay for.
Cold comfort
A GROUP of British oilworkers were recently undergoing a training
course in Bergen which involved them experiencing the thrill of a drop
into the ocean on a freefall lifeboat, as might be necessary in an
emergency.
The oilworkers were filled with some trepidation at the idea of
plunging into the water at considerable speed. ''What is it really
like?'' one asked the instructress, who did her best to reassure him.
''You will really enjoy it,'' she said. ''It is just like a
holocaust.'' After a pause she added the more comforting information.
''No. I think your word is roller-coaster.''
Opere buffet
PAOLO GALLI, the Italian ambassador to Britain was in Glasgow
yesterday, to inaugurate the Scottish section of the Italian Chamber of
Commerce. A bit late, we would have thought, since the Italians have
been happily doing business here for more than a century.
He was also in town to declare open the Signor Caruso restaurant
opposite the Theatre Royal in Hope Street. (He did this very simply by
saying: ''This restaurant is now open and I'm first in the queue for the
buffet.'')
Signor Galli said the restaurant was ideally placed for meals before
and after the opera. We had to inform him that it was also ideal for
meals during the opera. Take in the first act, pop across the road for a
bowl of pasta and a glass of wine or two, and you can be back in your
seat well before the end. As a true Italian he was appalled at the
concept of dogging most of the opera.
The Signor Caruso, in a previous incarnation, used to be known as the
Trattoria Caruso and was much frequented on opera nights by upmarket
Glaswegians. One of whom was heard to remark: ''How interesting. I
didn't know his first name was Trattoria.''
Passing the test
THE exam papers for the Standard grades are, we are told, much more
pupil-friendly than in our days. Thus the old question about filling
those leaking tanks in this year's maths exam contains the names of the
weans who are trying so to do. Political correctness is also involved
and the kids are called Sula and Hanif.
The physics paper involves two kids called Iain and Heather. Surely
the next step is to merge Sula, Hanif, Iain, and Heather. Even better we
could dig into Glasgow's recent past and have the leaking tank filled
with Irn-Bru by BaBru and Sandy, two advertising cliches of the past
consigned to the dustbin of history by the PC brigade.
Thought for
the Day
WE admit we laughed when we heard that the world's pilchards are dying
of some mysterious disease. We don't like pilchards. Then we heard that
this may be just the start of the deterioration of our food chain. Then
we became worried. To paraphrase T S Eliot, is this how the world will
end, not with a bang but a pilchard?

Companies are waking up to the need for communication skills in
European markets, reports Geraldine Abrahams
THE formal establishment of the Single European Market at the end of
1992 should have meant greater business links with our European
neighbours. But three years on, there are still many companies in
Scotland that have made little or no effort to explore the possibilities
offered in the wider marketplace.
Barriers -- both psychological and real -- have been raised because of
the differences in language and culture, and have caused a large number
of firms in Scotland with a potential for trading in Europe, to turn
their backs on opportunity.
Over the past six to eight months however, there is evidence that the
message is getting through, as more and more companies enrol their staff
on short, practical language courses which will increase both their
understanding and their ability to respond to customers, particularly at
the first point of contact.
There are various language centres and schools offering such courses
to industry and commerce, and one of them, GTG International Language
Centre, has discovered an area of business where knowledge of language
is becoming increasingly important not only to those businesses
themselves but indeed to the national economy.
Manager Helen Miller explained: ''Over the past six or seven months,
mainly through our tele-marketing work, we have discovered a real need
within the tourist industry. We have found that hotels are looking for
language training for a variety of different levels of their staff, and
to that end we have been successful in securing major contracts with
most of the large hotel groups.
''We have tailor-made courses to suit their needs and have been able
to bring them down to such a short duration that the hotels have been
able to put on board what they call front-of-house staff, which includes
receptionists, telephonists and restaurant staff.
''Ninety percent of the people who come on such courses are beginners,
and they are given very basic language training coupled with useful
phrases, with a lot of emphasis on customer care so that they can meet
and greet their clients in the correct manner.
''Japanese Awareness Courses, for example, look purely at the cultural
aspects of the language and the country because there are so many
mistakes made by meeting people incorrectly. We have often found it more
beneficial for staff to understand the culture before they begin to try
and speak the language.
''As a result of this tourist type of trade, we are currently doing
some research in conjunction with GDA and once the information is
assimilated, we may create a focus group in Glasgow looking at these
areas within the leisure industry.''
This customising of the training provision is the key to teaching
languages for business purposes, and has been a vital factor in the
success stories of the various language trainers working in Scotland.
The International Language Centre, for example, specialises
predominantly in business language training, with courses being
industry-led according to the needs of the client. The centre currently
has around 200 language tutors covering all European languages, Russian
and Japanese.
Normally, training would be carried out in-house and in small groups,
offering a more flexible and convenient service to companies, or at
training centres. The International Language Centre has one in
Somerville Drive, Mount Florida, and at Hillington.
Despite the challenges that are out there in the international
marketplace, some companies will never take the initiative. When faced
with the situation where they are travelling abroad and meeting their
continental equals, they will continue to encounter embarrassing moments
where their counterparts will at least attempt to communicate in English
while they are unable to say anything at all in any other language.
More and more business people are finding such situations untenable,
says Helen Miller: ''We now get a lot of managers who have been to-ing
and fro-ing for a while and come to us in a panic, saying that they must
do something about the problem. This is very much crisis language
training. Some other companies tackle the language problem almost as
soon as they have established initial links.''
The more far-sighted firms go a step further, creating good
communication links with their potential markets before embarking on
business so that when it comes to building industrial and commercial
links in Europe, they have already created a sound foundation in terms
of understanding the language and culture of their European
counterparts, and good communication makes good business sense.
How does Helen Miller see the future? ''I would hope that by the year
2000 we would not have to be so persuasive to bring people on board. I
would hope that by that time people would have learned the validity of
taking time out to do a little extra training in languages,'' she says.
''We are still very isolated as a country and that is where we are
losing out. If we were in Europe, we would not even be discussing
this.''
* GTG International Language Centre provides language services
throughout Scotland and is the first private language centre in Britain
to achieve BS5750/ ISO9002 as well as already having Investors in People
and the Scottish Quality Management System award.

I HOPE that Bishop Holloway will not mind a dyed-in-the-wool
Presbyterian writing to offer support.
Could I recommend that some of the reporters and journalists who claim
to know his mind so well read his book, Anger, Sex, Doubt and Death, in
order to acquaint themselves more fully and correctly with his views? In
it he comes across as being a man of great compassion and understanding,
perhaps virtues lacking in those who have sensationalised his
pronouncements.
Surely he is only following his Master's example in loving the sinner
while hating the sin?
The section of this book which deals with death helped me to come to
terms with grief and the complex emotions which one experiences after
the loss of a loved one.
I also recommend that these same people read Bishop Holloway's book,
Behold Your King. It belongs to the ''I couldn't put it down until I was
finished,'' category.

WHO can doubt the professional way sex education has been marketed to
Scottish teenagers over the last 25 years? Family-planning clinics now
operate teenage-friendly hours. When the bell closes the school
afternoon session the clinics dispense the latest abortion and
contraceptive technology. GPs regularly prescribe sometimes lethal
contraceptive cocktails to underage girls without parental consent.
Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, the Greater Glasgow Health
Board on advice from the Scottish Office opened in Glasgow a Sexual
Health Help (SHH) clinic for teenagers. The reason being that the latest
research demonstrates that around 50% of 13-19-year-olds were sexually
active and were not seeking the help they need from the existing
providers.
So once again the State picks up the bill for this sexual hooliganism,
hooliganism on such a scale that death will result from sexually
transmitted diseases, HIV and abortion.
The vice-chairman of the GGHB, the Rev Roddy Campbell, puts a
different spin on it: ''Schools were failing to meet the needs of
children by not providing effective sex education.''
What are the sexual needs of 13-year-olds and how is the team of youth
volunteers going to help? Presumably these are sexually experienced
youth volunteers suitably primed on the latest low-dose pill or armed
with the latest spermicides and rubbers.
I hope they are experienced in all forms of sexual deviation and
peccadillo as we would not want to offer an amateur service.
The best advice for a 13-year-old is to remain a child and to refrain
from sexual acts. I fear that the Rev Roddy Campbell and his cohort will
merely fan the fires and that in 10 years time the GGHB will proudly
announce that although 75% of Scottish teenagers are now sexually active
it has been able to sterilise 15%, about 25%, and the rest are on secure
long-term contraceptive programmes. However, the GGHB will add
additional funding if needed to deal with the psychological trauma
caused.

I WOULD remind Mr Irvine (The Kirk's self-inflicted wounds, May 18)
that God was willing to spare Sodom if one good man, other than Lot
presumably, could be found therein.
That being so, He is not likely to wind up the Church of Scotland
because of the backsliding of a rather large percentage of this
generation. The faithful few are still with us.
A few good seed potatoes can produce a large crop. In the wisdom of my
old age, I would advise the Kirk to start with the Sunday School (I was
a teacher).
Dear knows why Mr Irvine is against women in the eldership. In my
experience the bulk of the Kirk's work, other than ministerial, is done
by women.
We need women, more than ever, to keep the Sunday School together. If
the children are not taught the Gospel, you will never get the youth to
join the Church. If you teach the children, the youth may drift away for
a bit, but will come back when they get married and settle down and
introduce their own children to Sunday School.
Happy families is by best description of a happy kirk.

THE well-publicised case of the custody dispute over Lucia Cortes
highlights the need for people to know more about family mediation
services (May 19).
Family mediation can help parents to make arrangements for their
children after separation or divorce. Mediation encourages reduced
conflict between parents and can enable both parents to retain shared
responsibility for the children. Research has shown this results in a
better outcome for the children.
Mediation can take place at any stage from before separation to after
divorce but the earlier the intervention the greater the chance of
success. It is important to emphasise the availability of family
mediation services throughout Scotland and those being developed
throughout Europe. Some Scottish services also provide children's
counselling, children's groups, and family access centres.
The demand for these services is ever increasing. Every year around
10,000 children in Scotland experience their parents' divorce. That does
not include the growing number of children whose parents separate and do
not divorce or separate without ever having been married.
Against this background we must ensure greater availability and
awareness of services which can reduce conflict and disputes.

I CANNOT help being intrigued by the sentence passed on Mr Anthony
Williams (May 21). Here we apparently have a man who took public money
in order to effect improvements and create jobs in a Highland village --
surely an appropriate use of public revenues?
Admittedly, he used money which was not intended for this purpose but
he does seem to have used it more effectively than, say, the Northern
Ireland Office in its grants to DeLorean or the Scottish Office when it
supported Caterpillar.
Perhaps I should be less flip about such a gross theft. However, I
cannot help comparing the #5m which Mr Williams diverted to the Highland
economy with the billions wasted by the Government in its effort to
maintain an inflated value of sterling in 1992.
Do we really have the right person behind bars?

CHIEF Constable Leslie Sharp is right to be alarmed at the dire
prospects for policing currently clambering over the political horizon
(May 18).
Policing for people is what we have and what we must keep. Policing
for profit is unacceptable and must be treated as the non-starter that
it surely is.
The office of constable is still among the most respected of our
professions and the power of arrest, questioning, investigation,
detention, and charge must be restricted to those who are professionally
trained for these tasks which are undertaken with the authority of the
Crown, that is on behalf of us all.
This authority cannot be defused amongst a myriad of private security
firms which cannot afford to provide the specialised training our police
receive, or teach and maintain the degree of commitment our police give
to the public, and remain financially solvent.
Attempting to quantify policing and the performance of officers in
market terms is the policy of the madhouse. Of course costs must be
monitored and the force run as economically as possible without
detriment to its operational ability.
However, there is no escaping the fact that effective operational
policing can never equate with the market-place.

YOUR report of the striking-off by her GP from her list of Mrs
Copland, a multiple sclerosis sufferer, and the refusal of another GP to
accept her as a patient, highlights a serious and growing problem in the
NHS (May 18). As the health board spokesman correctly pointed out, any
GP, unlike a hospital doctor, is entitled to strike off any existing
patient at any time without giving any reason.
This is quite unacceptable. GPs are expensively trained and highly
paid at public expense for one reason alone: to be of service to the
public. It is very disturbing when they abuse their unique privilege in
this heartless way.
The solution to this problem is to change the law to make it clear
that GPs must fulfil their obligations to their patients. It is patients
who should choose their GPs, not GPs patients. That is the only way to
prevent future cases like Mrs Copland's.

IF one was in any doubt as to who was running Scotland for the last 20
years then the announcement by Cosla of an 85% pay rise for some senior
local councillors leaves one in do doubt.
One would have thought that it was the function of Government or MPs
to state what the payments to councillors would be. Of course, if the
Government is not going to do it, then Cosla is delighted to oblige.
The majority of local electors of any political persuasion would, I am
sure, agree with the suggestion that they should get a rise tied to the
present rate of inflation.
Possibly one has missed the announcement by the Government that being
a councillor is to be more of a salaried career than it was.
One of the reasons given by the Government regarding the amalgamation
of region and district authorities was that it would save money.
The proposed increase is certainly not any saving nor is the movement
of a chief regional official to a new chief county appointment, as I
notice that ''under national terms and conditions of reform, a salary
reduction is made up for three years''.
Possibly the enormity of the task of cutting Cosla's wings has caused
Tories not to attempt to reduce its power. But it should be attempted.
We need a Tory David for the Goliath Cosla.

James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, argues that
genuine peace in Northern Ireland means the practical search for common
purpose between the communities rather than simply an absence of gunfire
and a succession of high-wire initiatives
GIVEN the trauma of 25 years of terrorism, it was hardly surprising
that a bout of the head staggers occurred in various quarters following
the announcement of the terrorist ceasefires. The peak of silliness was
reached with pollsters running up and down the streets of Belfast
demanding that every unsuspecting shopper answer the question ''Do you
want peace?''.
Any attempt on the part of the citizen to offer a realistic assessment
of how the peace, which we all naturally desire, might be guaranteed,
placed him or her in the negative bracket. Thankfully, realism has now
become established as the basis on which all parties must proceed. Real
answers to real questions are now being sought.
The ''Do you want peace?'' scenario portrayed my party in the role of
spoilsports. We decided not to turn a blind eye to the continued
punishment beatings, to concentrate on the regeneration of the Northern
Ireland economy as a priority, to caution against an upsurge in drug
abuse in Ulster. We were consequently cast as sourfaces.
As political representatives in an ongoing political process, we found
ourselves unable to put Northern Ireland on hold and into chaos. We do
not seek credit for this. We simply believed that we ought to act
responsibly and to prepare for the task ahead of us. The basis for this
attitude was laid when, long before the ''peace process'', my party
decided it ought to address itself to how Northern Ireland would react
to an IRA ceasfire, and how best we could continue to give leadership to
the greater number of people in Ulster in such circumstances.
We decided that the single most effective way of ensuring peace would
be if emphasis was placed on developing stability in our society. That
involved concentrating on Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom.
The greater number of people in Northern Ireland of all religions, and
none, wish to remain within the UK and that, therefore, is the context
within which stability is most likely to come about -- a democratic
context.
The people of Northern Ireland have been frustrated over the years as
one high-wire initiative has followed another. What they want to see is
a sensible, long-term approach to giving their lives as much sense of
stability as is enjoyed by the average man or woman in Scotland.
This means building, brick by brick, on firm foundations. We do not
need political progress to be sacrificed at the altar of summitry in
order that long-suffering viewers can be shown yet more ''live''
pictures of the grass growing on the lawn at Stormont.
If Northern Ireland is ever going to enjoy genuine peace and
stability, we all know that it will have to come about through a sense
of common purpose shared by parties and people alike. I have been
greatly encouraged by the willingness of the other democratic parties
who have answered the call of the Ulster Unionist Party for all of us to
hold discussions on matters of importance to all of those whom we
represent.
In meeting with the SDLP and Alliance Party, and continuing contact
with the DUP, I have been greatly encouraged by the mood of realism
which has taken hold. It is as if the framework document was nothing
more than an enormous hot-air balloon which has drifted up somewhere
beyond the clouds, leaving us to get on with co-operating on economic
and social issues which, we all recognise, demand our immediate
attention.
Following the discussions with the other parties, we have engaged in
discussion with the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, on the
matter of political progress. The term ''peace process'' was largely
coined by Sinn Fein as a device to link them to the democratic parties.
Given their long-term investment in violence, most of the rest of us
found it a distasteful term.
However, it is interesting to note that whereas we are now discussing
political progress with Sir Patrick, Sinn Fein are finding themselves in
a real peace process with the Minister of State, Michael Ancram. These
discussions are entirely separate from those in which we are involved.
The talks with Michael Ancram are about how Sinn Fein can gain
promotion into the world of real politics in which argument does not
depend on arms. The Government have made it clear that the next stage in
the peace process is the dismantling of the terrorist apparatus. This
will be a test of both IRA/Sinn Fein sincerity and of Government
resolve. Government firmness on this issue must be maintained. The
mistake of getting entangled in Provo-speak must not be repeated.
Recently we marked the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World
War in Europe. As a veteran of that war, I was impressed by the way in
which people throughout Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland
commemorated the anniversary in a spirit of celebration and solemnity
which was only possible because we chose to remember as one nation, with
a sense of common identity woven from the various strands of our
society. The media responsibly chose not to abuse the programme of
events but to report them in such a way that people reading their
newspapers, listening to the radio, or watching on television were able
to share in the events with those who were actually present.
After so many years of criticism of the institutions and people of
this country, with every opportunity to undermine national morale
exploited to the full, it was encouraging to see the media once again
tap into the national spirit.
Perhaps we have turned the corner from continuous national
self-criticism. I can think of few other developments which would be of
assistance to Northern Ireland in seeking to build a better future. For
many years, I have sought to persuade those who are pro-Union to have
confidence in themselves. This would be greatly assisted by a reduction
in attacks from outside.
The result would be a Northern Ireland safely within the United
Kingdom, at peace with itself, and confident enough to build improved
relations with the Irish Republic. Such a situation is possible provided
that reality continues to determine the agenda.

IF THE aim of the Victorian park-makers was to ''make people virtuous
and happy'' or, in the case of Edinburgh, apparently ''to cure
drunkenness'', what should our park strategists be planning for the next
millennium?
Few would deny that Britain's parks have declined since their heyday,
that they have become culturally devalued, that the very places intended
to make us happy and healthy are too often regarded as unsafe and
unhealthy.
The questions now facing our planners and park authorities are where
to find the resources necessary to finance park regeneration, and even
if they do find a source of revenue, should they spend the money along
traditional lines, or create a new vision of urban parklands in which
parks become the sites of health centres, leisure facilities, or
wildlife centres?
A report published today by the think-tanks Comedia and Demos is the
biggest ever inquiry into park policy in the UK. Its findings make
depressing reading -- only 30% of British parks and recreation grounds
now have toilets, few women will go to a park unaccompanied, and
vandalism is spiralling upwards.
Park officials in ''that Dear Green Place'' of Glasgow have a
different story to tell, however. In less than two weeks, Glasgow
District Council's parks and recreation committee will be asked to
approve a new strategy, the result of an extensive public consultation
exercise which will cost #78m.
Such a figure, not exactly small potatoes, will be expected to include
partnership funding from agencies such as the Glasgow Development
Agency. The various lottery funds can expect to receive applications,
too.
But Glasgow's strategy has to be seen against a background of general
malaise throughout the country. Brian Atkinson, environmental manager
with the parks and recreation department, is convinced that Glasgow's
strategy is far ahead of any other British city's. But he cannot deny
that Glasgow suffers from the same problems as elsewhere -- vandalism,
old trees coming to the end of their natural life, conflicts between the
interests of dog-owners and the parents of young children.
Some commentators have claimed that local authorities, shackled by
rate-capping and compulsory competitive tendering (CCT), have been
forced to pare their allowable spending on parks to negligible levels. A
report by the Planning Exchange for Glasgow Development Agency in August
1993 showed that Glasgow spent more on parks than other British cities,
although the report, using local authorities' own figures, also
shattered the myth that Glasgow had more parks and open-space provision
than other cities.
Mr Atkinson is adamant that CCT has had no effect on council budgeting
on parks, although the perception is prevalent elsewhere that resources
have been cut by other councils.
In Comedia and Demos's report Park Life, authors Liz Greenhalgh and
Ken Worpole call for new investment, in particular, funding from the
National Lottery, if parks are to lead the way in social renewal.
The bulk of the report, however, is an analysis of what has gone wrong
-- in other words why parks which in the Victorian era were at the
forefront of urban development are often now an after-thought and at the
bottom of the political agenda.
Nevertheless, there are still some successful parks which are seen by
people as local facilities, accessible to all ages, to all walks of
life, and a focus of that elusive notion of ''community''.
For some people, the park is a sanctuary, even if they never stop to
sit down but merely walk through it on the way to work or to shop. Some
parks are increasingly event-focused, whether for tourists, local
people, or schoolchildren. In the eyes of others, however, parks are
deemed too dangerous, a haven for drinkers, drug-takers, vandals, gangs
of youths, the forgotten souls in the care of the community.
While some argue for a police crackdown in parks, the Park Life report
calls for better management practice. However, it warns that as more
people move from city centres to the suburbs, and children become more
firmly wedded to home computers instead of outdoor games, local
authorities may have to concentrate on providing fewer and
better-quality open spaces rather than more mediocre parks.
Park Life's recommendation that Lottery funding be sought for park
regeneration is doubtless music to the ears of Glasgow District
Council's park experts. They have already drafted plans to seek Lottery
money to refurbish Springburn Park's Winter Gardens, to restore the
Doulton Fountain in Glasgow Green, and to regenerate Queen's Park. That
ignores the council's bid for multi-million pound funding from the
Millennium Commission to build an international indoor arena and
football centre of excellence at Fleshers' Haugh on Glasgow Green.
Such plans to site major sports centres, and their accompanying
parking facilities, within parks have already attracted criticism from
some community groups. The chairman of the pressure group Glasgow for
People, Mr Ian Bogle, is firmly against the commercialisation of
Glasgow's parks. Green open spaces should be for flying kites, going for
walks, playing football, he says.
Not that Glasgow district can be accused of failure to consult. Its
major marketing exercise, carried out along with the GDA, found that of
those questioned, more than 90% of residents use parks during summer,
more than 70% visit parks at least once a week, and 42% have taken
tourists to parks. On the positive side, people praised the maintenance
of grass and floral areas and the opportunity to enjoy peace and quiet.
The other side of the coin, however, was concerns about personal safety,
lack of toilet facilities, children's play areas, staff supervision, and
poor lighting.
The council's parks officials claim to have taken this on board and
have already instituted pilot projects such as dog exercise areas in
certain parks. The council's draft strategy includes provision for more
park rangers and better lighting to allay public fears.
Brian Atkinson claims that Glasgow does not have a serious safety and
vandalism problem compared with other major cities.
Inspector John O'Neil, force architectural liaison officer with
Strathclyde Police's community involvement branch, was one of those the
council consulted in drawing up its strategy.
He acknowledges that there is a continuing fear element which pushes
people away from using parks and suggests certain facilities, such as
children's play areas or gardens designed for the elderly, should be
situated at the periphery of parks, although not alongside each other,
so that people feel safer and have an easy exit route if necessary.
He recommends that the park ranger force be increased, and that its
members be better trained to deal with disorderly elements speedily, but
that they should not hesitate to call on local police officers at the
first hint of trouble.
Ed Gillett, a parks enthusiast and member of the Kelvingrove Park
Action Group, advocates that parks be kept green, open spaces, without
unnecessary development.
''In a city jam-packed with pubs, art galleries, and other buildings,
the whole idea of the creation of parks is a contrast from the sheer
stone mass of the urban fabric,'' he said.
The danger, according to some observers, is that the five Glasgow
parks deemed worthy of tourism and other developments -- the Botanic
Gardens, Bellahouston, Glasgow Green, Kelvingrove, and Pollok Park --
will receive the bulk of attention, and others will continue to suffer
from neglect.
A well-maintained park will retain its prestige, but a neglected or
vandalised park will detract from the value of a neighbourhood. As one
person questioned for the Park Life report put it: ''Why do people say
that when you live by the park the price of your house comes down?''
Glasgow's ambitious strategy seems destined to receive council
approval. A greater imponderable is whether the partnership funding it
requires will be forthcoming.
Of course, our cities could find themselves turning to the kind of
options favoured abroad: the creation of trusts to manage parks,
business sponsorship, and self-taxation schemes found in some cities in
the United States; or charging entrance fees, as happens in some German
cities. But for the present, Glasgow, for one, is committed to free
availability to all of its parklands, and absolutely no privatisation.

POLITICAL parties, you might think, exist to offer voters an
alternative. If Party A gets it wrong, we can switch to Party B for a
taste of something different. So, if the Conservative Party has brought
us recession and unemployment, can we look to Labour to give us boom and
full employment? Not any more.
Last night, Tony Blair announced a policy departure that will prove
even more revolutionary than abandoning Clause 4 and its commitment to
wholesale nationalisation. Giving the annual Mais lecture at City
University, the Labour leader unveiled his economic platform for the
next election: inflation is out, monetary and fiscal rectitude are in.
The creation of a stable macroeconomic environment, he declared, is
essential. Translated into English, his City-speak means Labour is no
longer prepared to accept rising prices in exchange for rapid growth and
more employment. Playing fast and easy with the economy is not an
option: ''The idea that inflation can be stabilised at around 5-10%,
with permanent benefits to growth, is pure and dangerous fantasy.''
The implications are momentous. By renouncing the use of inflation as
a means of creating short-term prosperity, Mr Blair has turned his back
on Old Labour's economic Achilles heel. Like its connections with the
trade unions, the party's reluctance to condemn inflation in all
circumstances has, until now, been looked upon by industry and the City
as proof that Labour simply couldn't be trusted with the economy.
Since coming to power 16 years ago, the Tories have relished reminding
the electorate of the financial crises that hit Britain under Labour:
inflation above 20%, industrial strife, eroded savings, and that banana
republic moment when Denis Healey had to ask the International Monetary
Fund for a loan.
Thatcherites pride themselves on their obsession with price stability.
Inflation, they say, is taxation without legislation, for which there is
no excuse. A little inflation is like being a little bit pregnant. But
as the boom of the late eighties -- and the recession engineered to
correct it -- proved, the Tories have not always been the party of sound
money. Instead, what they have been until now, is a party prepared to
ignore the social costs of bringing inflation down.
Take into account those excluded from the unemployment rolls and the
jobless total remains stubbornly above three million. Some economists
argue that in a post-industrial economy, with a deregulated labour
market, high unemployment is an unavoidable inconvenience. The
Government points to the steady decline in the jobless rate -- now at
8.3% -- but fails to mention that two recessions in a decade have
replaced secure manufacturing jobs with insecure and low-paid service
industry jobs.
By echoing the Tory loathing of inflation -- Blair insists control of
inflation is ''even more important than the Tories have said'' -- Labour
risks appearing more Conservative than the Tories: something wavering
voters and even party loyalists might find hard to accept. Why vote
Labour when all you might get is a nicer bunch of Tories?
Kenneth Clarke hit on the difficulty on Sunday when he accused his
Labour counterpart, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, of remaining
strangely silent on government policy. Labour, the allegation goes, has
found nothing to criticise in the Government's monetary policy. Faced
with the same circumstances, Clarke suggests, Labour would do the same.
Blair claims the Tory Mark II jibe is too facile, and his office
points to the steady stream of alternatives put out by Labour's Treasury
front bench. His speech goes a long way in proving that, with a
considered analysis of both the positive and negative achievements of
successive Tory Governments. The model he presents goes well beyond
simply controlling inflation, and attempts to reconcile macro and
micro-economic policy. Fighting inflation does not mean forgetting the
unemployed.
What Blair has identified, and which Old Labour refuses to accept, is
that the British economy is no longer an experiment conducted in a
vacuum. The UK is part of an active, deregulated global market. ''Since
it is inconceivable that the UK would want to withdraw unilaterally from
this global marketplace, we must instead adjust our policies to its
existence,'' he says. Privately his aides will tell you this reflects a
plain truth: the markets are all-powerful, and can't be ignored.
But this latest reordering of Labour beliefs will inevitably attenuate
the divisions which separate Old and New Labour. The promise of power
has so far kept the unreconstructed Left quiet, and out of Blair's hair.
However, such a clear repudiation of the anti-market, socially sensitive
imperatives which ruled Labour's approach in the past cannot but
alienate those who are not prepared to seek power at any cost.
If social justice matters to Labour, they will claim, then taking any
risks with unemployment is unacceptable. Anticipating the question,
Blair offered a simple answer in a Financial Times interview yesterday:
''It is the only way to get electable.''
Economists will applaud Blair's declaration that he is ''an unashamed
long-termist'' who will not play politics with the economy. But politics
has a way of making mockery of even the best ideals. Just imagine the
first few months of a Blair government. After 18 years out of power, the
shock of victory is rapidly replaced by a realisation that Opposition is
far easier than government.
Chancellor Brown is faced with a clamour for spending to satisfy all
those pent-up expectations. All those commitments to prudence and
monetary responsibility are put under enormous pressure by trade unions
and backbenchers, while the Bank of England and the Treasury's civil
servants counsel caution.
The markets smell a kill and move in on the pound. In the Commons,
Prime Minister Blair is pressed by his own side for public sector pay
rises and increased public spending, and the point is made that
regardless of what the massed ranks of markets and civil servants are
saying, it is his decision alone.
Only a scenario, perhaps. But examine what a Blair government would
inherit from John Major: government borrowing returned to acceptable
levels; inflation at an historic low, thanks to a combination of
political bravery on the part of Major and stubborn insistence from the
Bank of England; and -- with any luck -- a culture in which low
inflation has become an accepted way of life. Having declared himself to
be more Tory than the Tories in his passion for low inflation, there
will be precious little room for Blair to produce any noticeable change.
And that is where the challenge to the electorate lies: the changes
Tony Blair proposes are not overnight marvels or instant solutions. By
taking ideology out of economics, he has admitted there are no economic
levers for him to pull. If the British economy is in luck, there will be
no boom on offer at the next General Election. As last night's speech
pointed out, achieving sustained growth with low inflation is a long
hard slog.

Ann Coltart detects the possibilty of a compromise in the dispute over
siting a railway station which could bring new life to the historic
heart of Glasgow
AS the future of the British Rail system is hotly debated daily, a
continuing battle to get key railways stations operating in Glasgow has
shifted its ground from the city to Westminster.
Strathclyde region's transport chiefs have submitted their plans for
the long-awaited CrossRail route and stations in a draft provisional
order to Parliament for approval.
There is a widespread welcome, in Glasgow and beyond, to this proposed
railway link on the east side of the city, running from the High Street
down across the river to Pollokshields.
It should become a reality by the year 2000, after many years of
campaigning by public transport and amenity groups, and fresh thinking
by regional government.
However, swelling public opinion argues that a high-level,
high-profile Glasgow Cross station, which could eventually form an
interchange with the low-level Argyle Line, would be of strategic
importance -- but it is missing from the plans.
Glasgow City Council has now voted unanimously in favour of a station
at the historic crossroads, and Labour leader Pat Lally has been pushing
the city's arguments with the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive
(SPTE) against a parliamentary deadline today.
Along with the Glasgow councillors are several west coast politicians,
including 17 MPs, and a host of organisations and individuals -- many of
whom have taken professional advice and have prepared formal petitions
to present to Parliament.
They believe a station at Glasgow Cross, with a possible future
connection with the reopened station below ground, would improve
transport links for the city and for wider Scottish journeys.
It would also help revive the faded eastern quarter of the city and
highlight an A-listed building adjacent to the crossover tracks, where
the planned north-south line passes over the existing east-west route.
The listed Mercat Building is a majestic structure, wedging into the
crossroads between Gallowgate and London Road. Designed by A Graham
Henderson and built in the 1920s, its rump is abruptly sliced by an
overhead railway used for freight, which will become part of the new
CrossRail passenger line.
This truncated rear could be excavated a little further to provide
part of an overhead station, with access both to the subterranean Argyle
Line (where the old Glasgow Cross station cavern is still intact) and
into an open space of shops and cafes within the revamped Mercat
Building. The city council owns it and is offering it for use as a
virtual gift.
Strathclyde and SPTE have vetoed this idea until this week. Instead,
they proposed an overhead station several metres down the track, south
of Saltmarket and in the middle of a residential area.
''This is a silly place,'' said Pat Lally. ''It's quite unsuitable for
the station and will create a lot of problems for residents.''
Charles Gordon, chair of the regional transport committee, and Stephen
Lockley, SPTE director, have claimed there is little evidence that a
Glasgow Cross interchange would be useful to passengers; that it would
be too costly, too close to other stations, and cause too much
disruption if it were created.
Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson has, however, elicited from the SPTE
their own proposals for a Glasgow Cross interchange, presented less than
three years ago.
In this design concept report, a Glasgow Cross integrated station is
described as ''the flagship of the new network''.
Minds at Strathclyde somehow changed. Councillor Gordon and his SPTE
director became a little touchy on the subject as pressure mounted to
''put stations in the right place''.
''If these people who want a rail interchange would present figures on
which journeys would be facilitated, I'd be able to respond,'' said
Stephen Lockley. ''Our placing of the station in no way prejudices the
possible future opening of a low-level station at Glasgow Cross
anyway.''
Ken Sutherland, of the Railway Development Society, has waged an
unremitting campaign, with others, to persuade the region to ''do the
job properly'' on CrossRail, and has regularly produced maps of possible
journeys using the additional passenger track.
Councillor Gordon was persuaded to move a planned station at
Bridgegate, near the River Clyde, up the track towards the Cross -- but
only far enough to hit the Saltmarket residents, not straddle the
low-level line.
However, he says he has only just been made aware of the ''gift'' of
the Mercat Building from the city -- and has asked SPTE officials to
look at the Glasgow Cross ''flagship station'' idea again.
''We are examining the costings, traffic implications, and bridge
works there seriously,'' he said. ''We have no problems about changing
some details to the plans.''
But he claims that the High Street station resiting is a more
intractable problem. The plans moved the High Street station platforms
farther east. Strathclyde University and Merchant City organisations say
a great opportunity is being missed if the High Street station is not
relocated farther west, to serve the growing campus and still-developing
Merchant City area.
''But that would mean going underground with several engineering
challenges and would raise the cost too much,'' said Councillor Gordon.
The CrossRail Action Group is a new mix of traders, residents,
community, civic, transport and heritage organisations, determined to
see the revitalisation of the rundown eastern edge of the Merchant City,
with public transport as a major factor.
One of the group's central sparks is businessman Ron Smith, managing
director of Capones' wallpaper and paint warehouse, which lies beneath
part of the CrossRail route.
''Traders around here are all behind the idea of a station using the
Mercat Building,'' he said. ''We have seen our patch declining, shops
and offices going empty while it's busy just down the road where there
are bus, underground and rail connections. Business people would invest
if we could use the fantastic Mercat Building for a station cover and a
new centre like the Prince's Square development.''
Pat Lally agrees with him.
''It is a magnificent setting for such a plan and we're pushing for
it.''
Although the region had insists that the cost (estimated at about #5m)
and disruption to the Argyle Line puts a Glasgow Cross interchange out
of the running at present, its proponents claim there will be long-term
financial, transport, social and developmental benefits.
Feeling a threatened loss of benefits is the group of residents who
have learned that station platforms may be built over their already
overshadowed houses, or level with their windows.
Diane Young, secretary of the Saltmarket Place Residents' Association,
said: ''If they build columns to support the station, some people will
lose parts of their gardens, and there is one couple whose bedroom is
only 10 feet from the railway line already. With a platform, passengers
would almost be standing on their dressing table.''
These residents, now linked with others in the CrossRail Action Group,
have commissioned Mark Sullivan, an environmental and planning
consultant from England, to help them prepare formal documents to submit
to Parliament and the Scottish Office.
The politicians seem to be hovering at some compromise. Councillors
Lally and Gordon will be on the same council next year, following local
government changes. CrossRail supporters hope they can come to some
reasonable arrangement over a cup of tea, if not in a smoke-filled room.

<HEADLINE>Woman accountant awarded #14,245 in equal pay fight</HEADLINE>

A WOMAN accountant won her fight for the same pay as a former male
colleague and was awarded #14,245 compensation.
Mrs Elizabeth MacDougall, 48, took her former employer, Taggarts Motor
Group Ltd, of Motherwell, to an industrial tribunal because the company
refused to pay her the same as two male accountants.
A Glasgow industrial tribunal heard that Mrs MacDougall, a dealership
management accountant who earned #15,450, was paid much less than two
men with the same job title. Mr Brian McCoo, 31, management accountant
at Motherwell, earned #12,000 a year more, and Mr Alan Shearer, 52,
management accountant at Bellshill and Dunfermline, earned #8000 a year
more.
She discovered she was being paid a lot less when she transferred from
Bellshill to Glasgow and pointed this out to financial director Mr
George Ross. She was offered a 10% rise to #17,000 but when she said it
was only fair she should get what the men were getting, he said it was a
''historical problem'' and he would have to get back to her.
A short time later, she was told they were buying a new computer and
only one of the accountants, Mr McCoo, would produce the management
accounts. She and Mr Shearer would become internal auditors if there was
enough work for both of them.
She took the remarks to be veiled threats and gave notice of her
resignation next day. She complained to the tribunal that she was
constructively and unfairly dismissed.
The motoring company denied she was dismissed, as she had resigned, or
that they had breached her contract of employment.
They claimed the pay difference was justified by Mr McCoo's greater
workload, responsibility, and experience and there was no sex
discrimination. There were genuine differences in her duties and those
of the two men.
Mr Ross told the tribunal he had assured Mrs MacDougall that there
would still be a position for her, although not as a management
accountant. He told her the #17,000 salary offer was final.
The tribunal heard that after her resignation, Mrs MacDougall, of
Adelaide Place, Rothesay, moved to Bute when her husband retired.
In its findings, the tribunal accepted there were differences in the
workloads and responsibilities but not to the extent claimed by the
company. The tribunal concluded that she was employed on like work with
Mr Shearer but not with Mr McCoo.
She should have been paid the same salary as him, less #1000 as she
couldn't drive, which limited her ability to manage more than one
dealership.
The tribunal awarded her #12,950 compensation for the difference in
wages and #1295 interest.
Her constructive dismissal claim was rejected. The tribunal was not
satisfied she resigned because of the company's conduct.

SIMPLY being advised that something is good for you does not guarantee
a positive response. It can take a long time and a great deal of
education before attitude and practice are altered sufficiently to
produce a significant change. When the Scottish Joint Breastfeeding
Initiative was formally launched in May 1991, it was with an awareness
that just such a task lay ahead with all the inherent difficulties.
Four years on, the co-ordinator of SJBI, Jenny Warren, admits that at
the time of launching the initiative she would never have anticipated
the current level of success in getting the message across. She
certainly will not admit to the tremendous part she has played in this
achievement, turning what is essentially a part-time job into a more
than full-time crusade.
The message for Breastfeeding Awareness Week reflects the change in
thinking over the past few years. For 1993 the slogan was
''Breastfeeding's taking off in Scotland'', while last year's poster
showed a group of young women with their babies under the heading
''Breastfeeding -- can you tell?'', thus emphasising how discreetly
nursing can be done. This year's slogan is ''Breastfeeding needs
everyone's support'', and the poster features a family whose background
appears to be anything but ordinary.
The star of the show is four-month-old Dillon, a handsome young man
who generally smiles and flirts his way through life, while his parents,
Marie and Gordon, get on with supporting and caring for him and each
other.
Marie Anderson is an electrician, presently on maternity leave, and
contemplating a return to college to gain further qualifications in her
chosen field. After completing her four-year apprenticeship, she worked
first in Scotland, and then in France, Belgium, Holland and Gibraltar.
Her partner, Gordon Thomson, has a similarly unusual outlook on life.
He left an exclusive private school at age 16 with no formal
qualifications, but has never regretted this move, and is proud of
always making his own way.
His work experience covers a wide variety of jobs, but a couple of
years ago he discovered his forte, and is now an accomplished juggler.
He agrees that as parents they could be described as fairly exceptional,
and predicts rather wryly that ''Dillon will probably turn into a staid
bank manager, as an act of rebellion''.
On the surface hardly average, but in caring for their child they
share the concerns of parents worldwide. They want the best for Dillon,
and with this in mind Marie always intended to breastfeed, while
Gordon's support, encouragement and practical help have been invaluable.
They are delighted to promote breastfeeding and their reasons for
encouraging others are very positive. They consider it to be the most
natural way to nurture, the health benefits are far reaching and once
you have mastered the art you can breastfeed discreetly anywhere.
Marie's only reservation is lack of information before the birth. She
would like to have been told more about possible problems and given the
correct help and information which can quickly resolve any difficulties.
Dillon Thomson is a perfect example of what the SJBI hopes to achieve
in Scotland. It has almost gone beyond educating people about the
benefits of breastfeeding, and this is now widely accepted, not least
because of the ground-breaking research carried out in this country.
Evidence of the advantages involved gets stronger all the time, and
now points to the conviction that instant nutrition in the uterus and
during the first few years, sets a healthy pattern for life.
Scotland has taken these ideas on board to a much greater extent than
the rest of the country, and this applies to the general public as much
as to lay workers and health professionals. Breastfeeding Awareness Week
seeks to capitalise on this acceptance by taking it one step further and
initiating support for breastfeeding mothers from families, friends and
in particular, partners and mothers.
An information pack of ideas and activities compiled by Warren has
been distributed throughout the country, but area needs obviously vary
greatly, resulting in a variety of different events throughout Scotland.
Workshops, small support groups and information about baby-friendly
local businesses, cafes and shops are only a few of the objectives of
the week, while a problem-solving guide of the type Marie Anderson
recommended, is proving a universal hit.
The SJBI is due to end in September this year, but Warren hopes funds
will be made available for the work to continue. The Scottish Office has
started to show a genuine support by launching ''Supporting
Breastfeeding in the Primary Healthcare Team'' and distributing it to
every GP in Scotland.
Forrester Cockburn, Professor of Child Health at Glasgow University,
is famous for saying that a child at the breast is gaining ''not just
nutrition''. His reasoning for this is that the first two to three years
of a child's life are critical, not just for the chemical developments
taking place in the brain, but also for the interaction between mother
and child.
Children learn by copying and imitating and they acquire various
attitudes during that vital period which will be with them for a
lifetime. If physical or emotional abuse is sustained at that time, the
effects are long-term and similarly the beneficial consequences of
breastfeeding are lifelong.
In a family situation, a woman is more likely to breastfeed if her
mother did, and if she has support from those closest to her. An older
child who has vague memories of being fed will have these impressions
enhanced and heightened by watching a younger sibling suckle.
The tactile sensations and lasting security engendered by these images
will continue into adulthood and so produce another generation of
breastfeeders. For Jenny Warren and SJBI, such far-reaching results
prove without doubt that Breastfeeding Awareness Week produces the
desired results.

PAULINE McRoberts was in single digits when she broke one of her
sister's. ''It was my wee pinky,'' said Anne. ''She was burling me round
and round and I was shouting at her to stop.'' Pauline admits with a
frown: ''That incident is one I'm deeply, deeply ashamed of.''
The relationship between Anne, 16, and her big sister, Pauline, 20,
has always been fraught. Mum and dad can testify to that. In the early
years, Pauline regarded Anne not so much as a playmate but as ''a rag
doll''.
''My first memory of Anne is tripping her down the stairs and
battering her head off the radiator at the bottom,'' Pauline reminisces.
Anne is indignant at the memory. ''See what a bully she was?''
It's a sunny day in South Westerton, and members of the McRoberts
household are doing their respective things. Dad is away with the family
dog, a cocker spaniel who will dutifully retrieve the game his master is
involved in shooting. Mum is sleeping after a night's work, and Pauline
and Anne are gathered in the livingroom. Pauline sits cross-legged and
barefoot on the leather sofa, playing with her hair as she ponders each
question. Anne sits upright and shy.
Everyone has a gripe this morning. When Pauline awoke and couldn't get
back to sleep, everyone else had to get up in the house because her
music was played full blast. ''Half six I was up and went through to see
my dad. He was up, too, because of you,'' chides Anne. Pauline shrugs.
Tea is made and sipped as we discuss women's issues, such as men. On
this they agree: a unanimous vote for a big build and hairy chest. Anne
likes Rik Mayall, Jimmy Nail and Ross Kemp. I ask her what they have in
common, but Pauline interjects with: ''They're all ugly.''
The girls have, on occasion, had a great time together painting the
town red. Twice a week they scuttle off to step aerobics for a workout.
''It's actually been possible over this past year to be friendly with
each other,'' says Pauline. ''At the moment we're discussing where we
could go on our holidays. I can just imagine us at the age of 40. My
gran and her sister are pretty buddied up. It's good to see the two of
them hirpling about, getting the bus for a wee trot into Partick.
That'll be us.''
In the way of most sisters, Anne and Pauline have very different
personalities. On this, they drop into a rare bout of mutual
appreciation.
''Pauline can always come up with more jokes than I can; she takes
after my dad that way, with her sense of humour,'' says Anne.
''I think Anne is a tower of strength,'' explains Pauline,
''especially to her friends. She's the one they go to when they've got
problems -- an agony aunt. I must admit, I broke up with someone not so
long ago, and I was glad to speak to her. She's always a true friend,
and quite a forgiving person. And if something annoys her, she'll tell
you.''
Pauline admires assertive people, probably because she admits that for
all her gregariousness she'd rather avoid confrontation outside the
family. She currently works as a full-time carer in a home for the
elderly.
''The qualified nurses I work with take no shit off anybody. Same with
my friends: you always know where you stand with them. Whereas I
pussyfoot around in the background, gibbering: ''Well, maybe I might say
something.''
Mrs Mary McRoberts suddenly appears in the doorway of the adjoining
kitchen. ''I'm all bleary-eyed,'' she apologises, yawning. ''You look
like a Gremlin,'' says Pauline, in a tone which passes neither as an
insult nor a compliment -- merely observation. ''They're so nice to
me,'' replies mum.
During family arguments, Pauline and Anne find that they take on the
diplomatic role of interpreter, explaining each other's actions to a
concerned, often irate parent, sticking up for each other, working as a
team, rather than at odds. It wasn't always that way.
''We've always had a thing about our clothes,'' Pauline admits. ''At
the moment we're sitting here dressed up as each other. Sometimes, you
would never get us out the door.''
From the porch to the car, there would be wild accusations of
pilfering: ''You've got my belt on'' versus ''No, you've got my shoes
on!''
''Instead of saying that equals it, we'd fight. So immature,'' Pauline
sighs.
''The last big fight we had was at Christmas,'' chips in Anne. ''I
used her lip balm.''
''She was being really cheeky and showing off,'' Pauline retorts.
''I think mum fell out with you as well,'' Anne returns. ''You were
kicking me.'' Pauline's teenage rebellion is referred to with great
solemnity by the family as her ''bad years''. She performed the usual
theatrics: drinking, hanging out on the streets, working on the same
timescale as Glasgow Airport -- late departures, early morning arrivals
and sometimes cancelling the return journey altogether.
She tells me: ''I think that from the ages of 13 to 17 I was probably
a nightmare. I was quite a horrible person to my family, but to my
friends I was great. To my sister I was a terror.''
''Pauline was very selfish, always thinking of herself,'' adds Anne,
who has a dossier of incidents to study. As the youngest she witnessed
the mistakes Pauline made. For her good behaviour, in comparison to
Pauline's anyway, her parents issued her with more trust.
''With me being different to Pauline, they gave me more freedom,'' she
smiles. ''I come home at four in the morning when I'm at The Tunnel.''
Pauline wants to pursue nursing, but Anne wants to work with kids, and
on the condition she passes her driving test, she has a ticket to work
in America. ''Its scarey, leaving your family, but it's something I want
to do.''
''We were actually having a conversation the other night about girls
round our way, Anne's age, who have got families,'' offers Pauline,
becoming serious, ''who are stuck in one-bedroom flats, and I think
that's an awful thing to happen to a young female. I've got so much
admiration for Anne, that she decided to get up and go and do something.
There are people who, at the age of 20, haven't got the guts to put
their boots on and go for it.''
Anne replies that one of her friends was 14 when she had her first
baby. ''It probably came through drunken stupidity,'' Pauline continues,
''but they didn't have the same outlook on life as Anne has, in that she
has the brains to say I want a bit of life to myself first.''
The four-year gap between Pauline and Anne has all but disappeared in
their maturity. Pauline regards Anne as an equal because she is clubbing
in her own right now.
''It's good to know, at the end of the day, you're going to come home
and there's going to be a best friend waiting for you: someone you don't
have to phone up to see if they can slot you in. She's not daft. I speak
to her as one of my own close friends. There's an extra-special bond
because she is my sister.'' Then, she adds, with a sideways glance at
her sis, ''But Anne's got a sharper tongue than I have.''
''I don't think so,'' Anne bridles.
''She is, she's a lot more huffy than I am,'' Pauline insists.
''Away ye go,'' peeves Anne. ''I am not.''

PLANNING constraints are frustrating a supermarket chain from
expanding in Scotland, it was claimed yesterday.
Mr David Sainsbury -- chairman and chief executive of J Sainsbury plc
-- said it had been making strenuous efforts to open more stores in
Scotland in recent years but ''very restrictive'' planning procedures
had prevented it from expanding as quickly as it would have liked.
He said Scottish planning regulations on ''out-of-town'' supermarket
developments -- which say that planning permission should be refused if
the town or city centre would lose more than 10% of sales -- are too
rigid and should be changed to comply with more flexible regulations in
England and Wales.
There, the only condition on such developments is that they should not
affect the ''viability and vitality'' of the town or city centre.
Sainsbury's has consulted the Scottish Office during its review of the
Scottish national planning policy guidelines on retailing and a Scottish
Office decision on a draft of the new policy procedures is expected
later this year.
The company has stores at Cameron Toll and Craigleith in Edinburgh,
Darnley in Glasgow, and East Kilbride, which generate a combined sales
of almost #200m per annum. It also plans to increase to 20 the number of
its stores in Scotland over the next two years.
Addressing members of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce as a guest speaker
yesterday, Mr Sainsbury said the company had been trying to expand in
Scotland for the past five years.
He said Sainsbury's initially faced problems in acquiring suitable
sites because some competitors made very substantial bids whenever its
name was linked to a site.
He added: ''Fortunately, we managed to avoid getting involved in these
silly bidding wars and we have now assembled a portfolio of sites right
across the central belt of Scotland at very reasonable prices.''
He said he hoped there would be a ''slight easing'' of the planning
regulations and that the Scottish Office would speed up the process of
hearing planning appeals ''so that the huge cost to business of delayed
planning provisions can be reduced''.
Sainsbury's had, on two occasions, waited two years from the date of
lodging an appeal to finally getting a planning consent or refusal
notice from the Scottish Secretary.
''This is clearly a major brake on investment and I believe that, at a
time when the Government is looking more and more for investment from
private industry, there shouldn't be these brakes on developments of
this kind.''
He continued: ''If we can get through the planning process, then we
will have a string of excellent stores opening in Scotland in the next
couple of years.
''We have sites in the planning process in Ayr, south Edinburgh,
Kirkcaldy, Dundee, Aberdeen, and Stirling and . . . we still own the bus
garage in Bearsden which, I am confident, will one day become an
interesting development opportunity.''
A company owned jointly by Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer has also
been granted planning permission for a shopping centre at Braehead
between Govan and Renfrew.
Later, Mr Sainsbury referred to the company's failed bid to acquire
the William Low chain and said it was disappointed to miss an
opportunity to make a ''quantum leap'' in its representation in
Scotland.
He claimed, however, there had been few William Low stores which
conformed with Sainsbury's requirements and the company would have had
to make many compromises to convert them.

<HEADLINE>MP calls for follow-up over outdated food</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978256060</RECORDNO>

A LABOUR MP has called for an investigation to establish whether a
chain of supply in outdated foodstuffs to small shops exists after a
shopkeeper and his wife were fined for selling food that was almost 10
years past its sell-by date.
The call by Monklands East Labour MP Helen Liddell follows the removal
of 15 bin bags of mainly tinned foodstuffs, ranging from hamburgers to
baked beans, which were not fit to be sold from a shop in Cairn View,
Airdrie, run by Mr Bashir Malik and his wife Shahin.
Local environmental health officers have conceded that a chain of
supply in outdated foodstuffs could exist. Although they have no
evidence at present, they are continuing to monitor the situation and
are likely to consult their colleagues throughout Scotland in connection
with any further investigations.
An investigation by environmental health officials from Monklands
District Council, launched after a complaint from a shop customer, found
that a bag of ground rice offered for sale in the shop was packaged by
the manufacturers in July, 1984. It had a recommended shelf life of 12
months.
A tin of soup found in the shop, which had been canned on July 15,
1985, had a recommended sell-by date of July, 1987.
The couple were each fined #1000 at Airdrie Sheriff Court after
admitting stocking food in their store which had no indication of
minimum durability, contrary to the Food Labelling (Scotland) Act, 1984.
The fine is the highest recorded in Monklands district and is
understood to be one of the highest in Scotland for such an offence.
Mrs Liddell said yesterday: ''From the quantity removed from this
shop, it makes me wonder if there is a supplier in outdated foods. I
hope efforts will be made to trace the foods back to the source if that
is the case.''
A district council official, asked if it was possible that a chain of
supply in outdated foodstuffs existed, replied: ''Yes, that is possible,
although we have no evidence at this time.''
The official said: ''If anyone has any information or concerns about
foodstuffs they should contact their local environmental health
officers, who will investigate the matter.''
He said environmental health officers in Monklands would continue to
monitor the situation. It was likely any investigation would involve
consulting environmental services departments in local authorities
across Scotland.
Mr Graham Bryceland, the district council's director of environmental
services, said the heavy fines should be a warning to other retailers of
the importance of vigilant stock control.
Health officers visited the shop in January after a complaint from a
member of the public and advised Mrs Malik that all food bearing no
''best before'' date should be removed from the shelves. The officers
found some of the offending food was still on sale when they returned
two days later.
All the offending food was collected in bin bags and dumped at
Dalmacoulter tip.
Mr Malik declined to comment yesterday on the case. When approached at
his shop, he said: ''You have no right to come in here. I have my
rights. This is ridiculous.''
After telephoning his solicitor, he added: ''My wife has been treated
for cancer. I have a heart condition. You have to leave my shop now.''

THE Assembly yesterday rejected a move to urge all members to give 1%
of their annual income to the Kirk.
The meeting voted 360 to 297 against a motion aimed at increasing
offerings.
Mr John McCulloch, of Penicuik, said while cash offerings had
increased it still represented only a little over #1 per week from each
Church member. ''That is not enough,'' he said.
More had to be done to persuade people to give more than a couple of
pounds each week, he said.
Mrs Ann McCool, of Stevenson High, Ayrshire, said she knew of some of
the poorest members who gave as much as they could and said the Assembly
should be encouraging congregations to give proportionally.
The annual report of the board of stewardship and finance showed that
while Kirk membership fell by nearly 18,000 in 1994, offerings increased
by #2m while congregational income was up by nearly #3m.
The Rev Iain Paton, board convener, said the church was now emerging
in a much healthier state, but warned: ''We do not have space for
complacency.''
He said the average annual contribution of #59.24 per member could be
boosted greatly if activity could be rekindled among dormant Kirk
members.
Mr Paton also said there were too many people talking the church down.
''If we continue in this negative vein then people will believe us and
will decide that it is just not worth supporting us. It is time to be
talking ourselves up, to be saying what we can achieve.''

VIENNA: British lorry driver Mike Taylor remains stuck between Austria
and Hungary as he tries to ferry aid to refugees in Bosnia. Mr Taylor,
who has made 22 trips to Croatia and Bosnia delivering aid, has been
told he does not have the correct papers to proceed nor papers letting
him go back to Austria. Mr Taylor, from Shropshire, said: ''This is

SMOKERS could create 155,000 jobs if they gave up cigarettes in line
with Government targets for the next five years, health economists
claimed yesterday.
Researchers said that if smoking in the UK fell by 40%, the cash
ex-smokers saved would be spent on other products and services.
The report, published by the Society for the Study of Addiction and
the Centre for Health Economics at York University, pointed out that a
20-a-day smoker would save #900 a year by kicking the habit.
Most of the jobs -- 155,000 in all, and equivalent to 115,000
full-time jobs -- would be created in hotels and catering, sport,
museums, theatres, and cinemas.
Ms Christine Godfrey, one of the report's authors, said that even if
some of the money previously spent on tobacco -- a total of #8500m in
1990 -- was saved, it may eventually be spent on more expensive items
such as cars.
Their findings echo those of the Fraser of Allander Institute at
Strathclyde University, which calculated in 1989 that if smokers in
Glasgow gave up, 4000 jobs could be created in the city alone.
They showed that most of the #122m which people in Glasgow spent every
year on tobacco went in taxes and import costs, with only 6% going on
Scottish-produced goods and services.
Yesterday's report is based on there being 40% fewer smokers in
Britain by the year 2000, the target set by the Government's ''Health of
the Nation'' report.
Doctor Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA's head of health policy, said:
''This report buries the argument that reducing smoking has a negative
effect on the job market.''
However, Dr Nathanson admitted that the 40% fall was unlikely to be
reached.
There are around 16 million smokers in Britain, with 29% of men and
28% of women still lighting up.
Total employment in the tobacco industry was around 12,000 in 1991,
well down from 40,000 in 1970. If the target was reached, there would be
around 4000 fewer jobs.

A SCOTTISH father and his three children, travelling the world in a
horse-drawn caravan, must remain in Mongolia. A court overturned an
earlier ruling finding him guilty of deliberate wounding but ordered
that the case be reinvestigated.
Last night David Grant from Orkney was said to be shocked at the
court's decision, taken at an appeal hearing in Ulan Bator. Mr Grant can
not leave the country until the investigation is completed.
Last month Mr Grant was found guilty of deliberate wounding. He was
given a three-year sentence, reduced to two years and suspended, after
an incident last October.
Mr Grant had been travelling the world with his wife Kate and their
three children Torcuil, 15, Eilidh, 13, and Fionn, 10. Last November, as
they were crossing Mongolia, the family claim a group of drunken
Mongolian men tried to steal one of their horses.
Eilidh, afraid for her father's safety fired a catapult at the men,
hitting one of the men in the eye. Several weeks later Mr Grant was
arrested for the attack.
Last night Mr Grant's wife Kate, who returned to Britain nearly two
months ago, said the saga had become a nightmare. Speaking from her
father's home in Southampton, Mrs Grant said her husband had been in
tears on the telephone when he had called her after the hearing.
''I am very upset and so was David when I spoke to him. I just can't
understand the reasons for doing this. The man who says he was injured
claims he now has new witnesses to an incident that happened six months
ago.''
She said her three children were well but money was tight and the
family were desperate to leave the country. She said they were trapped
in Mongolia without an exit visa and had been given no indication as to
how long the investigation would take.
She said she had met with Foreign Office officials and intended to
appeal to Mr Jim Wallace, her MP.
A Foreign Office spokesman said a close watch had been kept on the
case but there was little the Government could do. ''We can not
interfere in the legal system of another country.''

A COMMUNITY is divided over the site for a new hospital designed to
improve standards of health and provide a wide range of services.
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board wants to build a single-site community
hospital to meet the needs of the people in the east of its area --
around the main towns of Cumnock and Mauchline -- and have invited
comment from patients, medical staff, and the NHS trusts which would
provide the services.
Now, the debate has become polarised, with one camp supporting a
hospital at Cumnock and the other backing a project to build on the site
of Ballochmyle Hospital, near Mauchline, which is currently being run
down towards closure.
A second stormy meeting on the subject is expected at Cumnock Town
Hall on Thursday and, while all parties are trying to play down talk of
a split, there is no doubt that feelings are running high.
Two of the trusts involved, North Ayrshire and Ayrshire and Arran
Community Health Care, yesterday put their weight behind the Cumnock
option, saying it would provide the best service for patients in the
areas of deprivation and poor health standards.
On the other side, South Ayrshire Trust -- which owns Ballochmyle --
wants not only to build the hospital but an associated ''village'' of
housing and retail developments.
Somewhere in between, leaning slightly towards Ballochmyle, is Mr
George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, who has
expressed his concern that health care is becoming a pawn in a political
game being played by the trusts.
He said: ''It seems, on the face of it, that Ballochmyle would be the
proper site, as the land is in public ownership and there is a long
tradition of health care there.
''I am concerned and angry, however, that such an important issue is
being used as a pawn as the trusts jockey for position in the provision
of health care. It demonstrates again the utter anarchy and chaos caused
by the modern set-up within the NHS.''
The health board consultation document calls for a hospital offering
such services as 24 medium acute beds for GP care, consultant and
para-medical outpatient clinics, continuing care beds for the elderly
and disabled, and support services such as pharmacy and diagnostic
investigation.
There is concern that only up to 40 beds for the frail elderly are in
the brief -- compared with 116 at present -- and this is to be
reconsidered.
The board will take public consultations until the end of this month
and consider them at its meeting on July 6. However, it is believed
unlikely work would start before next spring.

AN OFFICIAL of the union Unison, Mr Neil Henderson, claimed at an
industrial tribunal in Stornoway yesterday that the new chief executive
of An Comunn Gaidhealach approached him in a public house and said:
''You'd better not defend that bastard Maclean.''
Mr Donnie Maclean, 58, is claiming unfair dismissal as national
director of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which organises the Royal National
Mod each year.
He was ordered to clear his desk just days after Mr Donald John
MacSween, 44, took over as chief executive in January 1994.
Mr Maclean, a former TV producer, was accused of unauthorised buying,
selling a word processor without permission, and responsibility for the
financial disaster at the 1993 Airdrie Mod Fringe.
The tribunal hearing resumed yesterday after a four-month break.
Mr Henderson said he was advising Mr Maclean after he was suspended
when he bumped into Mr MacSween in the public house.
Despite cross-examination by An Comunn's solicitor, Mr David Walker,
Mr Henderson insisted that Mr MacSween, who also was a former union
official, had given him the warning and used the word ''bastard'' in the
Carlton Tavern in Stornoway.
The hearing continues.

<TEXT>
THE former marketing manager of a soft-drinks company told a court
yesterday of a telephone call alleging a cockroach had been found in one
of his firm's bottles.
Mr John Hempstock, 63, said he agreed to meet the caller at Glasgow
Central railway station after police had wired him up to make a sound
recording and video of the encounter.
The tapes were played to a jury at Glasgow Sheriff Court, where three
men deny attempting to extort #9000 from Afton Spring Ltd, of Cumnock,
on May 27 last year.
Mr Paul McBride, 24, of Seamore Street, Maryhill, Mr Tariq Ishaq, 22,
of Argyle Street, and Mr Alan Bastien, 22, of St Vincent Street, all
Glasgow, deny threatening Mr Hempstock that unless he paid the money,
they would tell newspapers they had found a cockroach in one of Afton's
soft drinks.
Mr Ishaq also denies making several phone calls to the firm to extort
money.
Mr Hempstock said a man identifying himself as ''Mr Ali'' had phoned
claiming he had found a cockroach in one of Afton's bottles and was
worried about the health of his family.
He told Mr William Duffy, prosecuting, that when he suggested the man
telephone environmental health officers: '' . . . the caller said he did
not think our company would want any fuss and suggested a meeting.''
Mr Hempstock said police were contacted and an hour before the meeting
he was ''wired up'' for sound and told that police would have him under
observation. At the station, two men approached and one introduced
himself as Mr Ali. Mr Hempstock identified Mr Ishaq in the dock but said
he was not sure about the second person.
Mr Hempstock said he was shown a bottle in a carrier bag and could see
what looked like an insect near the top of the bottle.
During the playing of the sound recording, a man's voice could be
heard asking Mr Hempstock how much money the firm made each week and
each day.
The trial, before Sheriff Daniel Convery, continues.

THREE of six Algerian immigrants who began a hunger strike in Greenock
Prison while awaiting deportation have been transferred to the hospital
wing of Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow.
A Home Office official with responsibility for immigration confirmed
yesterday that three of the men had been moved to Glasgow on Sunday
after medical staff at Greenock expressed concern about their condition.
They had been preparing to enter the third week of a hunger strike
organised as a protest at their incarceration in the prison.
She said the condition of the three Algerians in Barlinnie was not
considered ''critical'', although two of them have been refusing fluids.
Two of those detained at Greenock had breakfast yesterday while another
was taking fluids.
The official added: ''None of them is critical although we are closely
monitoring their state of health.'' She declined to comment further.
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said the detainees would be moved
from Barlinnie's hospital wing to a mainstream hospital outwith the
prison only if they became ''sufficiently unwell''.
Dr Norman Godman, Labour MP for Greenock, last week took up the case
of the Algerians by writing to the Home Office Minister with
responsibility for immigration, Mr Nicholas Baker, to complain formally
that the six had been locked up in prison while their deportation cases
were being considered.
The Algerians, some of whom have been behind bars for several months,
are protesting about their treatment. They have requested political
asylum to avoid going back to their home country, where a civil war has
claimed 40,000 lives in the past three years.

<TEXT>
Paris, Monday
THE West's energy watchdog raised the alarm today over Moscow's
nuclear power programme, citing cost-cutting and low morale as a serious
threat to safety at Russian plants.
The International Energy Agency, in a sharply critical report on
Moscow's energy policies, said Russia's nuclear industry was dogged by
unreliable pay for elite nuclear workers and inadequate funds for
regulation.
One solution would be for Russia to use part of its vast atomic
stockpile as collateral for special Western-backed loans.
''The nuclear safety situation in Russia is unsatisfactory,'' IEA
executive director Robert Priddle said after hosting talks in Paris for
Energy Ministers from the forum's 23 developed nations.
The report was drawn up by the IEA after a six-month analysis of
Russian energy and was originally to have been aired directly with
Russian Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik.
Shafranik, howver, cancelled out of the forum last week, giving no
reason.
Priddle said the IEA's idea was for Russia to use its stockpile of
refined uranium, the world's largest and estimated to be worth up to
#13.5 billion, as a way of raising the finance it needed to make nuclear
reforms.
Ministers noted the report but took no decisions, he said.
The IEA's worries over safety stem in part from a loss of morale among
Russia's nuclear engineers, whom it says face unreliable pay and a loss
of status in Russian society.--Reuter.

AN ANGLING club has been told it is too successful and, if it wants
its lease renewed, must make the fishing ''less attractive''.
Members of Kype Angling Club, which issues day tickets to the public,
yesterday ridiculed the edict from Strathclyde Regional Council's
estates department as ''a failure syndrome''.
They warned they would rather close down than bow to ''such a
ludicrous philosophy''.
Officials stressed that a first-class, low-cost facility was being
provided in line with central and local government aims to actively
encourage the development of leisure pursuits on publicly-owned waters.
Local councillor, Mr William Irvine, has also condemned the new lease
conditions, arguing they are excessively onerous and contrary to the
authority's social strategy.
The club has already agreed to cut membership, allow season ticket
holders only two visits a week, and limit stocked fish to a maximum
one-and-a-half pounds in weight.
However, it is not prepared to concede an annual demand for #150 plus
VAT towards maintaining the road which provides sole access to the Kype,
near Strathaven.
Officials argued that members -- as council taxpayers -- had already
paid for the road's upkeep. They saw no reason why they should pay
twice, especially when Strathclyde's water department used the road to
reach a reservoir owned and operated by the council for public supplies.
Anglers suspect the council's stance over a new 10-year lease is
designed to force the club to abandon the water so it can be turned into
a commercial fishery.
The holder of an eight-month-long season ticket at Kype is charged
#37. Juniors and pensioners, a third of the membership, pay #22 and day
tickets cost #8 -- about half that charged on some privately-owned
waters.
Club vice-president, Mr Hugh Burns, said yesterday: ''For the sake of
survival, we could accept a rent increase to take road maintenance into
account. But, as a matter of principle, we cannot accept a separate bill
for repairs to a road the council uses in the course of its business.''
The road is the heart of the controversy; it is the subject of a
bitter dispute between its farmer owner and club members, who come from
Glasgow, Ayrshire, and Lanarkshire.
The council has access across farmer Alexander Harper's land only in
connection with the water works and he questions if that legal right of
way extends to anglers who pay Strathclyde #250-a-year for the fishing.
Mr Harper has complained to the estates department that too many
anglers' cars drive at excessive speeds on his road which cuts between
his farmhouse and outbuildings.
The club, in turn, alleges he has damaged the single-track road with
heavy farm machinery and tried to block their access to the reservoir
with a tractor or other vehicles.
The estates department further claims the club's charges are too cheap
in comparison with commercial fisheries, that anglers damage the
reservoir by over-useage, and stocking policies encourage too many
visitors.
In a letter to the club, estates director, Mr Neil Macfarlane,
complained of breaches in an agreement ''to reduce the attractiveness of
the fishings'' and added: ''The regional council must insist upon usage
being greatly reduced.''
Mr Burns said the 11-year-old club has already cut the number of
members from 180 to 145, with income falling #1500 last year. He denied
stocking with rainbow trout had led to overfishing and pointed out that
hours have been cut and speed limit notices erected.
Mr Harper, of Hareshawhead Farm, said: ''I have no objection to people
enjoying the fresh air and God's own country. But I do object to
stocking because it leads to 'fishmongers' rather than fishermen
flocking to the water, with up to 20 cars going up and down the road in
convoy. The Kype should be left to nature and brown trout.''
The club, which offers free fishing to the blind and others with
handicaps, is adamant that access issues must be resolved before signing
a lease.
An estates department spokesman said last night that negotiations were
continuing.

<TEXT>
A BANK robber trying to confess his crime had to telephone police a
second time after they asked him, ''Is this a joke?'' and then hung up,
Glasgow Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Conscience-stricken James Johnston, 43, of Fyvie Avenue, Mansewood,
Glasgow, had called to say: ''I've robbed a bank.'' He had to ring back
before he was taken seriously.
When police did finally arrest him, none of the #1800 -- which he
admitted stealing two years before from the Bank of Scotland's
Battlefield Road branch in Glasgow -- was recovered.
Now, an internal inquiry is expected to be ordered at Strathclyde
Police headquarters in Glasgow.
Advocate-depute William Totten told the court that Johnston handed a
bank teller a note stating: ''Pass over the money.'' He indicated he had
a handgun in his jacket pocket and the teller gave him the money.
Mr Totten said that, some time later, Johnston told his son he had
robbed the bank. He said he could not live with the crime on his
conscience and decided to telephone the police.
However, Mr Totten said: ''His call was treated as a hoax by police
and he had to call back before being taken seriously.''
Defence advocate Martin Jones, who said that before the robbery
Johnston's sister had been killed by her common-law husband -- who was
later jailed -- said: ''He told police he robbed the bank so that he
could buy a gun.
''It was a bizarre attempt to get into Barlinnie Prison to kill the
man who killed his sister. Had he not made a full and frank confession
to police, he would probably not have been found out.''
Mr Jones said Johnston had lost his job and had a ''catastrophic drink
problem'' at the time of the robbery.
He told temporary judge, Mr Gerald Gordon, QC: ''Because of his
previous good character and the unusual circumstances, I would ask that
he is not sent to prison.''
Judge Gordon deferred sentence for three weeks for psychiatric
reports.

LET me give you the dirt about the General Assembly. There's plenty of
it about, mostly under the seats.
Perhaps the tendency for the Kirk to sweep problems under the carpet
is catching, and the Assembly Hall cleaners are taking their lead from
those who voted on Saturday to have their cake and candy stall at home
and feed the Third World hungry, as if the Kirk can easily afford both.
Having complimented the Kirk on its great technological leap forward
in switching to CD for recording the Assembly procedures, let me warn
that the machines may clog up from dirt. There is plenty on the wood
panelling which could do with a wipe from a rag soaked in turpentine.
The Rev John Cairns may be the man to do it. He seems to be the
Assembly handyman these days. Convening the Judicial Commission, and the
Forces Chaplains on one hand, and being Moderator's Chaplain on the
other, as well as speaking on behalf of Carberry Tower -- he seems to
have been doing a bit of painting since his trousers looked to be
splashed with colour.
Someone told me he is wearing tartan trews beneath his frock coat
while doing duty as Moderator's Chaplain. This will fit nicely with the
Army ethos which Moderator Harkness has brought to the role. He has
already been paid the honour of his own pipe tune, entitled ''The
Reverend James Harkness''.
Much was made at the opening session by the puckish outgoing Moderator
James Simpson about the fact that the Kirk has now had three successive
Moderators with the same Christian name. This trinity of Jimmys was not
the one referred to in a letter which arrived last year at 121 George
Street addressed to ''The Second Person of the Trinity'' and was passed
to the Moderator's office.
It turned out to be an invitation from a Scottish Office civil
servant, unused to the ways of the Kirk, who had asked a passing
colleague, whom he knew to be a Kirk elder, to name the head of the
Church of Scotland. ''Second Person of the Trinity'' he replied promptly
in giving Jesus his Sunday title.
Dirty money was the theme of the afternoon debate on social
responsibility. There is a continual shortfall in contributions from the
state to the Kirk for the running of its 43 eventide homes. This is not
new but has now become so serious that convener Bill Wallace warned he
could not play King Canute for much longer.
Some homes would certainly be closed soon and nearly half within the
next three years if the care gap (currently at #10m) was not bridged, he
told the Assembly in an excellent speech.
The work done by his board -- the largest national social work agency
-- is even more excellent, but it could not resist the moralising
tendency which last year tempted it into making announcements about
homosexuality and this year into condemning the National Lottery.
It was the board's undoing because King Canute was left staring at the
care gap with no-one to ask a single question about a hugely important
report on the morality of genetic research produced this year by his
board.
Instead, the dominant issue of the day became gambling, another tragic
instance of preferring to preach than to practice. Some cannier minds
like the Rev Iain Paton (stewardship convener) and the Rev James Simpson
(buildings convener) wanted to keep their options open to be able to use
the allegedly dirty money.
Bill Wallace, at a press conference after the vote, claimed the Church
was still committed to refusing to apply for lottery funds. At first
sight the motion passed gives this impression, but yesterday's lengthy
debate neither solved nor clarified the issue.
While the old and unborn were left to fend for themselves, the only
winners of this debating lottery were those who won the right to speak
against the national one.

COST-PRUNING by a dogmatic management in the Coastguard Agency will
result in the lives of rescuers being unduly risked or lost, a former
member of the service claimed yesterday.
The concerns of former Shetland coastguard Jim Evans will be raised by
Labour in the Commons.
He thinks the public is being duped into accepting an illusion that
working in offshore industries has become safe, when the opposite is
true.
Mr Evans, who has been involved with search and rescue for 21 years,
recently resigned from the Coastguard Agency. He had become
disillusioned by a ''dogmatic and autocratic management'' who took too
long to respond to the problems raised by staff.
He has sent his concerns to Mr Paul Channon, MP, chairman of the
Transport Select Committee, which has been critical of the Government's
policy, and other interested MPs, including Ms Joanne Walley, the Shadow
Shipping Minister, who has been alarmed enough to table several
questions arising from his claims.
Mr Evans believes the dangers for those who work at sea and, when
required, their rescuers, will increase as the West of Shetland province
is developed for oil. He thinks that workers, and even the Government,
are being misled about the reality of the risks faced.
Mr Evans, a former Fleet Air Arm search and rescue team member who
joined the Coastguard Agency three years ago, claims it marks Not For
Public Release on ''almost all'' incidents which are oil related.
''This is why the oil fields appear to be safer,'' he told The Herald
yesterday.
''Why are these incidents not for public release? Is it Coastguard
Agency policy, oil company policy, or Government policy?''
Mr Evans maintains that search and rescue professionals are expressing
doubts about their ability to operate efficiently in the extreme
conditions in the West of Shetland waters.
At the moment, there was not a helicopter available to conduct a
search and rescue mission independently in the extreme sea conditions.
Winching people from ships and liferafts in 80ft waves would be a
nightmare, causing severe stress for the units sent to assist.
It was not necessarily up to coastguards to provide safety cover but,
where the oil companies did not, it would be up to them to ''pick up the
pieces''.
He said it was only the professionalism of some of the rescue teams
which had saved the day on a number of occasions.
''The time will come when a coastguard operations team sees loss of
life due to a lack of resources and that is now the bottom line in many
areas of the UK.''
Mr Evans, 48, who is now based in Brighton on board a 55ft converted
trawler and about the take over a public house in the town, said: ''The
coastguards should be saving lives, not money. The Coastguard Agency is
going down a road from which there is no turning back and lives will be
lost because of it.''
From July 1, to save money, coastguards will take over from BT the
monitoring of the VHF Channel 16 emergency frequency, besides keeping a
radio watch on the 2182 KHz distress frequency. The additional
responsibility, Mr Evans says, means Mayday calls could be missed.
The change might be sensible if manning levels and the technology
available were suitable but it was being done on a ''You have it, now
work it!'' basis.
''It is a gross dereliction of duty to assume that everything is all
right. It is far from all right,'' he said.

THE Assembly yesterday accepted an invitation from the Scottish
Episcopal Church to enter into direct negotiations on union.
It approved a recommendation by its ecumenical affairs committee to
take up the invitation ''to see where the spirit leads''. Only a small
number of commissioners voted against.
The invitation emerged from dialogue between the two Churches and four
other Churches in Scotland held over the past 29 years.
The Rev Duncan McClements, convener of the committee, said there were
still issues to be teased out and convictions to be accommodated before
a document could be presented. Any firm proposals for union would have
to come back to the Assembly for approval.
The Rev Maxwell Craig, general secretary of Action of Churches
Together in Scotland (Acts), said two systems of Church polity were
widely used in the world -- one with supervision by a person and the
other supervision by a committee of one's peers.
However, the Assembly had often given the impression ''we are running
scared of bishops''.
Mr Craig said: ''It seems to me we have no good reason for running
scared of bishops like those in the Scottish Episcopal Church.
''Bishops in the Episcopal Church are elected and have nothing in the
way of pomp and ceremony and I suspect, given the will, we could find a
place in a united Church in Scotland for this congenial kind of bishop
alongside supervision by one's peers.''
Mr Craig asked the Assembly to enter the talks with the intention of
''breaking the bishops barrier to some degree''.
Mr Derrick McAllister, an elder in Laigh Church, Kilmarnock, opposing
acceptance, said it was more important to achieve a spiritual revival
than structural union.
''We must never forget our inheritance and the cost of that
inheritance,'' he said.
The Scottish Episcopal Church's delegate in the Assembly, the Right
Rev Michael Henley, Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Meigle, said his
church had recently put its own house in order by looking at its
episcopate and by ordaining women as priests.

THE Assembly yesterday agreed that the Church would not make
applications for funds from the National Lotterty.
Churchmen also resolved that the Kirk would not seek cash from the
Millennium Fund which is funded entirely by the proceeds of the lottery.
The Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the board of social responsibility,
told the Assembly that the launch of the lottery had ''sullied and
degraded'' national life and had set out both to encourage and exploit
the downside of human nature.
''It is disturbing to see the poor exploited in order to fund projects
which will be used largely by the rich,'' he said.
Urging the Assembly to maintain the Church's opposition to the
lottery, Mr Wallace said that it would be ''almost inconceivable'' for a
Christian Church to resort to funds from the lottery to celebrate the
millenium.
He was supported by the Rev William Craig, of Cambusbarron, who said:
''The Church should not seek to profit from this massive confidence
trick played on millions of people.''
But Mr Ian McCarter, an elder of Dalkeith, Midlothian, accused the
Kirk of ''hypocrisy'' by accepting grants from organisations such as
Historic Scotland which are set to be partially funded by the Lottery.
Earlier, the Rev Iain Paton, convener of the board of stewardship and
finance, expressed concern about the lottery funding of Historic
Scotland.
''The Church does not have resources of its own to maintain buildings
of national or historic importance,'' he said.

A THIEF who caused nearly #120,000 worth of damage in a raid on a
municipal rubbish dump was jailed for seven months at Stirling Sheriff
Court yesterday.
Robert Taylor, 27, of Forthview, Bannockburn, stole just a handful of
items -- including a telephone and a first- aid box -- from a Portakabin
at Stirling District Council's Lower Polmaise tip at Fallin.
He had gone to the tip last December to rake through refuse but
accidentally set fire to the office and a #112,000 compactor machine.
Damage to the office was estimated at almost #7000.
Taylor, who admitted theft and setting fires, told police he had
started the fires while using his cigarette lighter to look around in
the dark.
Defence agent Ian Angus told the court Taylor was an unemployed
landscape gardener living on income support: ''Given the extent of the
damages claim, compensation is out of the question,'' he said.
Jailing Taylor for seven months, Sheriff Robert Younger told him he
had caused a ''terrific amount of damage''.

In Cannes
A TALE of teenage sex in New York shocked the Cannes festival out of
lethargy yesterday with some critics branding it ''kiddie porn''.
Kids, the directorial debut of photographer Larry Clark, has been the
talk of the festival since it opened.
Variety, the trade magazine, declared it ''poised to be one of the
most controversial American films ever made -- Kids is going to be the
mother of all holy ratings wars''.
Clark shot the film from a script written in three weeks by one of the
teenagers he photographed in a city park. He recruited only amateurs to
play his characters, and shot it for a reported #54,000.
It tracks teenagers for one day and one night as they hang out and
lurch from kick to kick -- sex, drugs, riding skateboards, and beating
up a black man.
Critics, who had to fight their way into the first screening through
an excited mob, lurched out in a daze.
Clark, 52, best known for his provocative photography books Tulsa and
Teenage Lust, is not only aiming at the Golden Palm award but also at a
special prize for first-time directors.
Kids opens with the pubescent lead kissing a 14-year-old girl as a
giant teddy-bear looms in the background.
His seduction attempt is successful, and related in coarse and graphic
detail to a friend moments later -- a taste of the coarse exchanges that
run through the film.
Through one of the boy's conquests, we discover he is infected with
the HIV virus. The girl later tracks him down, only to find him making
love to another virgin.
Industry professionals wonder how Miramax, the producers, will square
distribution of the film with their parent company Disney. Clark said he
would refuse to make any cuts.
''Old Walt probably never imagined that films like -- heaven forbid --
Kids would inhabit the same small, small world as Snow White,'' said the
magazine Moving Pictures. -- Reuter.

KIKWIT: Doctors fighting Zaire's Ebola virus outbreak are trapping
forest animals, insects, and bats in a bid to find the source. The first
death in January this year has been traced back to a charcoal burner who
worked in the forests around Kikwit and doctors are trying to find out
if this is relevant. The virus, for which there is no known vaccine or
cure, kills by causing uncontrollable bleeding and has caused the deaths
of 101 people.

infection of haemophiliacs by Aids-tainted blood transfusions. The
inquiry goes back to when Schweitzer was chief-of-staff to Socialist
Prime Minister Laurent Fabius in 1985, and doctors discovered French

A SCHEME has been launched to tackle the problem of sex offenders.
The Bridge Project works with youngsters aged from 10 to 18 in an
effort to make sure that their sex abuse behaviour does not continue
into their adult years.
It involves counselling, therapy sessions, and work with familes.
The youngsters are referred to the project, based in Dundee, by
social-work departments and other agencies.
Managed by children's charity Barnado's and funded by the Scottish
Office, the initiative is the first of its kind in Scotland.
Mr Peter Bates, Tayside region's social work director, said research
indicates that a number of adult male sex offenders started abuse in
their childhood.
He said: ''The project is concerned with correcting disturbed and
misplaced behaviour in children.
Youngsters referred to the project are assessed and an individual
programme is drawn up.
Each offender is dealt with for more than two years and they are
encouraged to understand what they have done and the hurt they have
caused to victims, who are usually other children.

ALMOST half of the Church of Scotland's homes for the elderly could be
closed within three years because of a cash crisis.
The Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Kirk's board of social
responsibility, yesterday warned the Assembly that some could close
within a year if action was not taken to close the cost of the care gap
which threatens the future of the Kirk's 43 eventide homes.
The Church has given #10m from its own reserves in the last five years
to meet the increasing cost of caring. This supplements public money
given to support elderly residents.
Presenting the board's report, Mr Wallace said the growing gulf
between the cash handed out by the Government and local authorities and
the actual cost of the residential care had now put the homes under
threat.
''I have to serve notice to the Assembly that unless there is a major
change in our financial situation in the very near future the board will
require to close a significant number of our services. Some services may
well have to be closed within the next year.
''Indeed, if present trends continue we may be forced to close nearly
half our residential homes for elderly people within the next three
years,'' said Mr Wallace.
0 He pledged the Church would re-double its efforts and do everything
in its power to keep closures to a minimum, but added: ''We cannot play
King Canute for ever. The tide is rising fast.''
* The Assembly rejected a motion by Mr William Lithgow, Presbytery of
Hamilton, to note with concern moves by local authorities to persuade
the sick and elderly in residential care to sell their homes to recover
all or part of the costs of their care.
But it backed a second motion from the presbytery urging the
Government and council to reconstruct levels of public support given for
the care of the elderly.

ISSUES raised by homosexual relationships, unmarried couples living
together, and pre-marital sex are to be discussed by members of the
Church of Scotland in presbyteries, kirk sessions, and congregations.
The General Assembly agreed yesterday to commend the panel on doctrine's
study guidelines on marriage to Church members.
No decision is likely to be taken until a future Assembly on whether
to change the Church's view that sex should be within marriage and
homosexual practices are wrong.
The guidelines were presented at a discussion document giving both
sides of the question, the biblical position and contemporary attitudes.
The Rev Dr Stewart Todd, convener of the panel, said conflicting views
were adequately represented and a balance had been reached in the
guidelines. The working party which drew up the guidelines had been
changed to include representatives of those who dissented from the
panel's report on marriage last year when considerable controversy was
caused.
The dissenting members were happy with the balance that had been
struck.
Dr Todd said there was no time limit on the discussion, but there was
ample reason for getting discussion under way soon.
The Rev Professor George Newlands, Glasgow University, said the matter
was ultimately about justice and human dignity. Tolerance was not
enough.
He recalled that tens of thousands of homosexuals had been murdered by
the Nazis simply because of their orientation, adding: ''They are still
oppressed.''
The church should be where the pain was and should act in solidarity
with the disadvantaged, he said.
The Rev Iain Whyte, university chaplain, Edinburgh, who wore a red
badge which he explained showed support for people who were HIV
positive, said it was time for congregations to discuss issues which had
long been shoved under the carpet.
It was a small step to remove the conspiracy of silence and the
atmosphere of fear, he said.
The Rev Flora Munro, Cults East, told how she had worked in the gay
and lesbian community in pubs and clubs in Chicago and continued to do
the same in Aberdeen.
''I find in the homosexual community people who are crying out to hear
more about God and God's love because for too long all they have heard
about was God's wrath and condemnation.''
Mrs Munro said: ''These young people need our love and compassion,
guidance and comfort, to grow into mature people who are already taking
a serious part in society and holding good jobs.''
Mr Colin McLean, Bridge of Tilt, Blair Atholl, an elder, moved that
the guidelines be noted and not commended. He said the subject had been
studied for long enough without producing answers.
Mr McLean's amendment was heavily defeated.
The panel on doctrine is to undertake a further study following its
study of marriage. It is to report in future on the interpretation of
scripture in this area.

Jerusalem, Monday
ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin today froze plans to seize Arab
land in Jerusalem in a climbdown to save his government and Middle East
peace.
The PLO welcomed the decision taken at an emergency Cabinet meeting
and Arab leaders suspended a summit they called to discuss the
confiscation.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres made the announcement in Parliament,
where two Arab-dominated parties were threatening to topple Rabin's
three-year-old coalition government in a no-confidence vote later today.
After the announcement, one party withdrew its no-confidence motion to
ensure the government's survival.
''The government has decided to establish a team of Ministers chaired
by the Prime Minister to examine the issue of expropriating this land in
Jerusalem,'' Peres told a shocked Knesset.
Israel said last month that it would seize 131 acres of land in Arab
East Jerusalem for Jewish housing and a police station. This enraged the
Arab world, provoking calls for suspension of the peace process.
An Israeli Government promise on May 14 not to confiscate any more
land after the planned seizure did not satisfy Arab leaders, who planned
to co-ordinate a response at their largest summit in five years this
Saturday.
A spokesman for PLO chief Yasser Arafat said: ''It seems that the
Palestinian, Arab, and international efforts have paid off.''
The sudden climbdown angered Israeli right-wingers, who accused Rabin
of bowing to Arab pressure.
''This is a government of people lacking backbone who made a
humiliating and degrading surrender,'' said Israel's hard-line Mayor of
Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert.
The United States, Israel's closest ally, backed Israel on the issue,
exercising its first veto in the UN Security Council in five years to
kill a resolution opposing the land grab. The council's other 14 members
voted for the resolution.
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
Palestinians want it as the capital of a future state, but Israel vows
never to cede any part of the city.
At a joint news conference after talks with Peres in Gaza, Arafat said
he hoped Israel's planned land seizure in Arab East Jerusalem would be
its last.
Arafat said ''the most important'' element in their talks was Peres's
promise to meet a target date of July 1 for coming to terms on a plan
for expanding Palestinian self-rule beyond the Gaza Strip and West Bank
town of Jericho to more of the West Bank.
Under their 1993 peace deal, Israeli troops must redeploy away from
West Bank towns and cities and Palestinians must hold elections.
Peres said Israel would hand over eight more spheres of control to
Palestinians in the West Bank, including agriculture, electricity, fuel,
and gas. He said Israel would increase the number of Palestinians
allowed to work in Israel to 35,000.--Reuter.

Brussels, Monday
FIVE MPs who quit over corruption allegations made triumphant returns
to public life today, voted back into office by sympathetic voters and
those who distrust Belgium's justice system.
Four former Socialist Ministers, who were forced out of national or
regional office but never charged over the so-called Agusta scandal, and
a former Christian Democratic Defence Minister, who resigned for lying
to journalists about a villa he owned in France, all scored dramatic
victories in yesterday's General Election.
''Most of the voters for the Socialists and the Christian Democrats
are middle-lower to lower class, and for them the justice system is a
symbol of repression,'' said political analyst Helmut Gaus.
Other analysts attributed the comebacks of the scandal-hit politicians
to sympathy votes and party loyalty.
Opinion polls had predicted big losses for the Socialists, especially
the Flemish Socialists, who were recently at the centre of
investigations into a defence contract scandal in which Nato chief and
former Belgian Minister Willy Claes was named.
However, near-complete results showed the Dutch-speaking Socialists
increasing their vote tally from 12% to 12.6% in the decision-making
lower house, gaining two seats.
The Socialists from Wallonia, the French-speaking southern half of
Belgium, slipped from 13.5% of the vote to 12%, but both parties seemed
likely to retain their places in a four-party centre-left coalition.
The scandal involved the alleged payment of bribes by Italian defence
firm Agusta to Socialist parties, to win a helicopter contract with the
Belgian army. Agusta, as well as Claes, strongly denied any wrongdoing.
Christian Democrat Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene called the early
election in February, hours before the arrest of three senior Socialist
officials became public.
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene submitted his government's resignation
to King Albert today, paving the way for what are usually long months of
horse-trading to form a new coalition.-- Reuter.

Bonn, Monday
TWO HIV-positive German convicts tearing across Germany in a
high-speed Porsche with a prison guard as hostage phoned German
television by mobile phone today to complain that the police were still
hot on their trail.
''As soon as the helicopters are gone and we feel safe we will let our
hostage go,'' said one of the convicts, Guenther Finneisen, 37, in his
call to NTV television.
The convicts then handed the receiver to their hostage, who begged
police to give up the chase, so that they would release him.
''The police must keep away,'' Ditmar Kraft told German television in
a trembling voice. He is in the back seat of the Porsche with a
home-made bomb strapped to him.
German police in helicopters and cars, chasing the convicts as they
drove in circles around north Germany before heading south towards the
Harz mountain range in central Germany, said they did not expect a swift
end to the hostage drama.
Police issued a warning to the public to stay away from the men, whom
they said were armed, dangerous, and infected with the Aids virus.
Finneisen and Peter Struedinger, 38, overpowered a guard at their
prison in Celle near Hanover yesterday, using weapons they had made
themselves. They took the 35-year-old guard hostage and demanded a
Porsche as their getaway vehicle.
Broadcasting on radio frequencies used in Germany to inform motorists
about traffic conditions, police told the escapees they were willing to
negotiate and urged them to make contact.
Finneisen pledged he and Struedinger would not give up without a
fight.
''We will hold out as long as we can,'' he said. ''I'd rather die with
a bullet in the skull here outside than die slowly behind bars.''
The convicts, who had been in jail since 1979, also demanded DM200,000
(#93,000) in cash, but police did not say whether the money had been
handed over.--Reuter/AP.

EXPERIMENTS in smoking fish from the Caribbean and from waters around
Canada are being carried out in Argyll.
Fynefish Products in Tarbert plans to expand home and overseas markets
in a #175,000 development programme.
The scheme will add 10 jobs to the 35 staff employed by the family-run
business and production facilities will be upgraded to meet EC
standards.
The company also plans to buy more whitefish from Scottish fishermen.
Mr Duncan Blair, 41, who runs Fynefish with his brother, James, 38,
said: ''Back in the 1970s, we were smoking around 25 tons of herring a
week but since conservation measures came in, we were left with a huge
surplus capacity in our kilns.
''The interest in tropical fish has come through discussions with an
importer and we are now experimenting to see if fish like the tilapia
from the Caribbean will smoke well. There is a definite market for new
types of fish.''
Mr Blair added: ''I have just returned from the European Seafood
Exhibition in Brussels, where our products received a lot of interest
from new buyers, and I believe we can entice them with our growing range
of products. We are hoping to have them over to tour our facilities here
in Argyll.''
Investment in the scheme is being backed by a #105,000 package from
Argyll and the Islands Enterprise.
AIE chief executive, Mr David McIntyre, said: ''This family-run
business is very important for the local economy and provides vital
employment in an area where alternatives are not readily to hand.''

Karachi, Monday
UP TO 20 people were killed and 40 wounded today as a strike called by
an ethnic party paralysed the Pakistani port city of Karachi and nearby
provincial towns.
A Government official said that at least 10 people, including four
security men and a ruling party activist, were killed during the strike,
which was called by the Mohajir National Movement in protest about a
security crackdown.
Police and doctors put the toll at 16, including a driver burned to
death in a bus in northern Sindh province.
The Mohajiri ''black day'' provided a baptism of fire for the newly
appointed Sindh governor, Kamal Azfar. He replaces Mahmoud Haroon, who
resigned on health grounds.
Police said that a paramilitary ranger was killed in District East
when gunmen ambushed a patrol vehicle. Three policemen were killed in
separate hit-and-run attacks in District East and District West.
An activist of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party
was killed in District West and another person was found killed in
District East.
The latest deaths brought to 95 the number of people killed in ethnic
and sectarian strife in Karachi this month. More than 520 have been
killed in the city this year.
The area is a stronghold of the Mohajir National Movement, which
speaks for the majority Mohajir community of Urdu-speaking Muslims who
fled to Pakistan from India after partition in 1947.--Reuter.

Brussels, Monday
THE European Union and the United States made progress today on trade
issues from compensation for EU expansion to investment, but that failed
to hide differences over the US trade row with Japan over cars.
EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan emerged from a 25-minute
meeting with Trade Representative Mickey Kantor saying nothing had
changed in Europe's stance since last week when he voiced opposition to
US tactics in its trade dispute with Japan.
''I have nothing to add to what I said last week and nothing to
subtract,'' Sir Leon told reporters after the meeting.
Last week he said the US proposal to impose 100% tariffs on Japanese
luxury cars breached World Trade Organisation rules and threatened the
credibility of the new trade body.
To clear the air, he and Kantor discussed the car issue before a full
session with officials covering a wide range of trade issues from
bananas to animal traps.
Kantor later told a news conference that when disagreements emerged
between Washington and Brussels, it was important to resolve them
discreetly.
''When we agree we need to work together. When we disagree we need to
handle this properly,'' he said.
Despite the apparent rift over the US dispute with Japan, both sides
were upbeat on their meeting, which Kantor said had covered 17 different
issues. ''I can truly say we made progress,'' he said.
Commission spokesman Peter Guilford observed: ''They clearly didn't
rub each other up the wrong way.''
Among the issues cited by Kantor were talks aimed at settling
Washington's claim to compensation for the trade impact of the EU's
enlargement on January 1 to take in Austria, Finland, and Sweden.
He expressed caution over whether a deal could be finalised in time
for a deadline at the end of next month, but played down the prospects
of failure as an interim arrangement is in place.
''We made progress. Whether or not we will settle by the end of June
is not as important,'' he said.
On the banana trade dispute, Kantor appeared to retreat from a threat
to impose sanctions on some goods from the EU unless the bloc revises
its banana import system which Washington says discriminates against
Latin American producers.
On the touchy issue of an EU ban on imports of fur from animals caught
in leg-hold traps due to come into force on January 1, Sir Leon said
there was little chance of a delay.
He said he public opinion was very strong but he would do everything
to accelerate the search for a more humane alternative.
The ban has won warm praise in Europe but condemnation from the United
States, Canada, and Russia where trappers feel the EU's action threatens
their livelihoods.--Reuter.

Skoczow, Monday
THE Pope warmly embraced President Lech Walesa and his wife, Danuta,
today as old friends, but had only a short meeting with Poland's
ex-Communist Prime Minister.
Walesa greeted the Pope, as the devout Roman Catholic customarily
does, by kneeling and kissing his hand.
After a 24-minute meeting, the Walesas had a photograph taken with the
Pope, who stood between them tightly clasping their hands.
Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy, a former altar boy, was also a regional
Communist boss in the authoritarian regime Walesa and the Pope worked so
hard to defeat during the rise to power of the Solidarity union.
Oleksy's meeting with the Pope lasted nine minutes and the Prime
Minister later described it as ''very important and moving''.
On a brief, nostalgic journey home, the Pope said post-communist
Eastern Europe must remain vigilant to defend the spoils of freedom from
moral erosion.
He warned that the transformation of Polish society had high costs,
including ''the real social plagues'' of unemployment and growing
economic hardships for families.
At the start of a nine-hour stop in southern Poland, he also again
hammered home a plea he made in the Czech Republic -- that Roman
Catholics and other Christians admit their historical mistakes and seek
mutual forgiveness ahead of the year 2000.
The Pope arrived by helicopter in southern Poland, where he was bishop
before he became pontiff in 1978, after a weekend visit to the Czech
Republic.
Some 250,000 people, the biggest crowd of his trip, turned out for an
open-air papal mass on a cold, damp day to welcome him to the area where
he was born 75 years ago.
Later the Pope arrived back in Rome from his three-day visit, the
second of six foreign papal trips planned for this year.--AP/Reuter.

LEGENDARY actor and some-time drinker Oliver Reed did some typically
fast talking about a late-night incident in a hotel yesterday.
Just for once, the English actor, currently appearing in the Scottish
movie, The Bruce, was the innocent party.
Instead, Ollie's finger of guilt pointed at Mr Bob Carruthers, the
director of the movie.
According to Mr Reed, the unfortunate Carruthers was left in no doubt
by managers of the Park Hotel in Peebles that his presence was no longer
required after a night of singing and revelry in the hotel's bar on
Saturday.
Speaking in Peebles yesterday, Mr Reed said: ''The hotel staff didn't
ask Bob to leave, they just packed his bags and threw him out.
''It's a tiny storm in a teacup. In Peebles, at midnight, they want to
go to bed, they don't want a hooley going on.
''For once in my life, I am the innocent party. I was upstairs in my
bedroom getting telephoned by reception and being told, 'Will you please
turn your TV down'.''
A shamefaced Mr Carruthers admitted: ''I guess it's just difficult to
have a good time in Peebles. The hotel staff objected to singing and
general merriment and I was required to go to the Hydro the next day.
''I'll be a good boy next time I'm back but I'll probably not be
allowed back.''
Mr Lawson Keay, manager of the hotel, said: ''There was some singing
but nobody was asked to leave.''

A MAN who grabbed the steering wheel of a car in which he was being
given a lift home, causing the driver to lose control and plough into a
group of pedestrians, was yesterday jailed for nine months.
The car mounted a pavement in Causewayhead Road, Stirling, hitting
Thomas Leftwich an Edinburgh University undergraduate .
The brilliant student slid off the bonnet with blood pouring from his
ears, suffering severe head injuries.
The accident last July left Mr Leftwich, 20, of Argyll Park Terrace,
Edinburgh, with impaired language ability, and has forced him to take at
least a year off his degree course.
Last month, a jury at Stirling Sheriff Court found Paul Landsborough,
30, of Woodburn Terrace, Alloa, guilty of endangering Mr Leftwich's life
through culpable and reckless conduct.
He had spent the night of the incident drinking heavily. Sheriff
Robert Younger told him: ''I think at the time you did this as a joke
but it was a stupid and irresponsible joke which had serious
consequences for Mr Leftwich.''

Washington, Monday
THE shell of the federal building in Oklahoma City will be demolished
tomorrow morning with 100lb of dynamite.
A demolition firm has drilled holes in the pillars that hold the
structure up and will pack them with 200 or so small charges, and they
will be set off together some time after 6am.
There was much debate locally over whether to bring the building down
with explosives or with a ball and chain. The engineers much preferred
dynamite as it is far quicker and safer. The argument for the slower
method, which might have taken another week, was that the city's nerves
were not strong enough for a further blast.
Two, possibly three, bodies remain buried in the rubble. Rescue
workers think they know where two are buried, and have marked the site.
Once the walls are down and the bulldozers have cleared away the
rubble, they hope to find these two victims. The final death toll,
including the two and three killed in another building, is likely to be
166. One rescue worker was killed by falling masonry while tonight news
emerged of a possible final victim, a man who banked inthe building and
who has been missing since the explosion.
Meanwhile, Newsweek magazine reports today that the FBI expects to
arrest ''a group of major players'' in the bombing in the next few
weeks, including families and ''children as young as 12''.
Two people have been charged with the bombing and two other possible
suspects are in custody, on unrelated charges. One of the two prime
suspects, Terry Nichols, has a 12-year old son who was interviewed at
length by police.
Another possible suspect, mentioned in the Newsweek article, is a
white supremacist called Robert Millar, who runs a settlement he calls
Elohim City in eastern Oklahoma.
He was a close friend and pastor of a racist extremist called Richard
Snell who was executed in Arkansas on April 19 for murdering a black
policeman and a shopkeeper he thought was Jewish.
The date was the second anniversary of the federal attack on the
Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas.
The loose alliance of militias and apocalyptic visionaries that
believes the federal government is in the hands of an international
conspiracy believed further that the date of the execution was
deliberately chosen, and warned that Snell would be avenged.
The Oklahoma City bombing took place on that day. Mr Millar was with
Snell when he was executed.
* Terry Nichols' brother, James, appeared in court in Detroit today
and was released into a friend's care after more than a month in
custody.
He is accused of making and detonating explosives on his Michigan
farm, but is not charged in the Oklahoma case.

AN island bus row has turned into a holy war over services to Iona.
With their future at stake, Argyll coach operators are locked in
battle with a Lanarkshire-based company.
Today, they will hear the outcome of the tendering fight for a range
of services in Argyll, subsidised by Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive.
The Argyll firms claim it is a ''war of attrition'' which, if won by
Essbee Coaches of Coatbridge, will lead to job losses and an erosion of
the west coast economy.
The battle began a year ago when Bowman's Coaches of Mull lost
contracts, which it had held for 18 years, to Essbee.
The Mull company, founded in 1956, refused to concede defeat and
continued operating, without subsidy, in a business worth between
#220,000 and #270,000 a year.
Managing director James Bowman lodged complaints with SPTE about
Essbee's start-up services, alleging that essential coach specifications
had not been met.
Mr Brian Smith, managing director of Essbee, dismissed the complaints
as unfounded and said Essbee's operations on Mull were legal in every
respect.
Essbee sent two buses to Mull for scheduled services between
Tobermory, Craignure, and Fionnphort, including peak ferry connections.
Bowman's warned that it would be forced to shut down over the winter
and make 17 workers redundant. However, the fear of job losses won local
sympathy and the company continued to run four buses on the public
service routes.
Essbee claimed its rival was losing about #1000 a week. It reacted by
withdrawing from the runs and making two drivers redundant.
Now the war has taken a new twist, with both companies fighting for an
estimated #1m spent every year by pilgrims travelling to Iona.
Last month, Bowman's bought the Oban-based McDougalls Tours company to
broaden its west-coast business activities.
Most visitors to Iona cross Mull from Craignure to Fionnphort to reach
the ferry terminal.
Essbee and Bowman's tout for trade on the pierhead for 200,000
visitors each year, a number which has increased substantially since
former Labour leader John Smith was buried on Iona. Fares for the
37-mile journey have been cut from #3.30 to #1.30.
Mr Bowman is now running the service at a loss but says he will meet
the challenge and ''see off'' the outsiders.
Opening the battle on another front, Essbee has started inclusive Iona
tours from Oban -- #2 cheaper than Bowman's at #12.
Essbee's general manager Mr John Kinnaird said: ''This is a very
competitive business and we are giving the tourists an alternative. We
have bought ground on Mull and intend to build a new depot. We are here
to stay.''
0 At the same time that the Mull feud began, the Coatbridge firm won
the Mid-Argyll school run after SPTE enforced a 70-year-old Roads Act
preventing vehicles with more than 14 seats travelling on the B8024 road
to Ormsary.
Essbee used its good fortune to move in on other routes. In addition
to its two contracts on Mull, the company now holds several local
contracts throughout Argyll. With today's round of tenders, it is hoping
to strengthen its position.
WCM driver Mr Bobby Holden, of Ardrishaig, told The Herald that the
company's services had been ''harrassed'' by Strathclyde bus inspectors.
''On one occasion, I was fined #57 for being eight minutes early to a
stop -- yet I knew I was actually running late that day,'' he claimed.
Last night, Mr Kinnaird pledged that, after a ''fierce financial
commitment'' to Argyll, Essbee would maintain its presence:''We are not
going to go away because a few local firms who have enjoyed a monopoly
for many years suddenly find they have to sharpen up their acts.''

IN THE loveliest rose, there may lurk a canker. Mr Michael Heseltine's
inspiringly-titled ''Competitiveness -- Forging Ahead'' White Paper was
as glossily tricked out as the President who produced it.
Its 235 pages shone with graphs, maps, words that excite technocrats
like ''technology foresight'' and ''teleworking,'' although it was
occasionally let down by whole sentences like ''the retention of control
over the implementation of new policies by institutions close to those
being regulated will reinforce public acceptance of the need for
change.'' Well, perhaps.
The President of the Board of Trade presented it to the Commons in
overdrive, making it sound not far short of a state of the nation
address presented with a brio that made the Prime Minister sitting next
to him look faintly redundant.
A year ago, he told us, he had presented ''the first comprehensive
audit of the UK's industrial and commercial competitiveness.'' This
report on the year since then ''shows promises kept, action taken'' he
barked.
''This White Paper reports good news,'' he PR'd. Output, manufacturing
productivity, exports, investment were all up; unemployment, inflation
and the balance of payments deficit were all down.
Coming to grips with the second volume of Lady Thatcher's memoirs, the
President recorded that ''the turnaround in our economic performance
started in 1979.'' In case anyone felt that the 16 years since then had
not seemed as good as he was telling us they were, he put this in
perspective by reflecting that the task this heroic Conservative
administration had set itself was no less than ''to reverse more than a
century of relative decline.''
Listening carefully, it appeared we have not quite managed that yet,
but that we are relatively declining relatively more slowly which, if
not exactly ''Forging ahead'', does seem to represent progress of a
kind.
The President's Shadow, Dr Jack Cunningham, grumbled about this and
that, but the President saw him off by wondering why, if things were as
bad as he said they were, his leader was going around telling people
that nothing much would change if there was a Labour Government.
He joked about his reputation as a ''Euro-fanatic'', cracked a rather
involved joke featuring a few numbers in French, shrugged off Mr Dennis
Skinner's perennial complaint that the Tories had shut down just about
everything Mr Skinner cared about, with the aside ''that was New Labour
speaking.' All in all, he must have made Tory MPs with possibly saveable
majorities wonder if this might be the captain to steer at least some of
them back to their consultancies in 1997.
Most MPs, the Sketch suspects, will be among the multitude giving the
White Paper a miss but some smart chap flicking through alighted on a
panel on Page 71 giving a few thoughts on ''Funding old age'' -- the
canker as it turned out.
The last sentence reads: ''In these circumstances, individuals will
not be able to look to the state to fund improvements in their living
standards in old age.''
When the first Labour MP suggested that his precious White Paper said
pensioners should not expect to see their pensions go up, Mr Heseltine
simply replied that it was false.
By the time the third one got up waving ''Competiveness -- Forging
Ahead'' about, the President was getting rather red partly perhaps
because he could not remember what it said on Page 71 about pensions and
partly because he may have begun to think that Labour might be able to
make some political capital out of whatever it was.
The paragraph simply states that governments could not raise taxes
significantly to fund pensions without damaging national competitiveness
-- a truth that would be just as true under a Labour Government.
Mr Heseltine got going denouncing, with some justification, Labour's
willingness to scare for political gain. But by the time he had
finished, he seemed to be not so much ''forging ahead'' as conducting a
''fighting retreat.''

THE Government has announced a package of seventy new initiatives and
additional funding of #165m over the next four years to help improve
Britain's competitiveness.
Although the second competitiveness White Paper received a
supplementary Scottish launch in Glasgow before an audience of business
people, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang did not set out the funding
breakdown as far as it affects Scotland.
Most of the additional money -- about #125m -- will be aimed at
support for small and medium sized enterprises, through the network of
business shops in Scotland and the equivalent business links in England.
That money will be aimed at support programmes covering management,
exporting, technology and training.
The rest of the new money, about #40m, is aimed at stimulating
innovation. Some of the money will be used to maintain the Technology
Foresight programme, designed to pick out key developments in science,
engineering and technology in the years ahead.
National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell today will announce the
Government's conclusions on cross-media ownership.
In the Commons, the President of the Board of Trade Mr Michael
Heseltine claimed good progress had been made since the publication of
the first Competitiveness White Paper last year in reversing a century
of relative decline in the UK.
He claimed that overall UK manufacturing productivity now is close to
that of Germany and France, and continues to catch up with the United
States and Japan.
In Glasgow, Mr Lang was telling his audience that, on that score,
Scotland is outdoing the UK as a whole.
However, he warned: ''Competitiveness is an attitude of mind. It is
not a one-off initiative to be forgotten after an initial burst of
activity. The rest of the world is not standing still. Our mistake for
much of this century has been to assume that it would.''
During his resume of the 235- page White Paper, Mr Lang indicated that
Scotland's inward investment figures for the past year, due to be
published next month, will show a further improvement on the good
figures recorded in 1993-94.
Labour's Industry spokesman Mr John McFall said: ''The issues facing
the Scottish economy centre on achieving new growth, through the
expansion of the small business sector in particular.In doing anything
about that, this White Paper is long on rhetoric and short on muscle.''

THE Prime Minister sought last night to rescue his Government over its
stance on the Nolan Committee recommendations -- as Tory MP Sir Jerry
Wiggin appeared to escape from the latest ''sleaze'' allegations.
Mr Major wrote to Labour leader Tony Blair setting out in detail his
view on Nolan, and stating he very much hoped Labour would co-operate
with the select committee the Government is proposing to set up.
He said: ''I have made my view absolutely clear about the need for the
highest standards in public life. I set up the Nolan Committee for this
reason. I care about the reputation of Parliament and I want to restore
public confidence. That is why I set up a committee with wide
representation and why I have welcomed its report.''
Labour last night was considering its position on the matter after Sir
Jerry effectively escaped punishment in the row over his tabling of
amendments -- in which he had a financial interest -- to the Gas Bill.
He tabled them in the name of fellow Tory MP Sebastian Coe -- without
telling him.
The Labour left was outraged at the outcome, and last night 54 Labour
MPs signed an early-day motion calling for the case to be referred to
the powerful Commons Privileges Committee, which would have the right to
recommend Sir Jerry's suspension from the House.
.
However, the Labour Front Bench view appeared to be that the Speaker
had ruled on the matter and had drawn a line under it.
They felt it was much more important that the Prime Minister appeared
to be drifting in their direction over the Nolan recommendations and the
timescale of implementing them, and they want to maintain the pressure
on this.
A senior spokesman said: ''The Speaker has made this ruling but the
problem is we suspect she will continue to be faced with problems like
this. What today has shown is the need for Nolan's recommendations to be
implemented on an early timescale.''
In his statement to a subdued but tense Commons, Sir Jerry, the
58-year-old MP for Weston-super-Mare, unreservedly apologised to
Sebastian Coe and for ''an action which I acknowledge was at odds with
the proper expectations of the House.''
He said: ''There was no intention to deceive, but I accept my actions
were open to other interpretations and I wish to apologise to the House
without reservation for any harm this may have done to its reputation.''
Some Labour left-wingers shouted: ''Is that it?'' as Sir Jerry sat
down.
In her brief statement, Miss Boothroyd, who earlier had had a lengthy
meeting with Sir Jerry, said: ''Whatever structures and procedures we
have in this House, we cannot legislate for integrity and individual
Members should act in such a manner whereby their integrity is not
called into question.
''I trust this is the last distasteful occasion on which the Speaker
is obliged to inquire into the conduct of an Honourable Member.''
Several MPs -- including Labour's Dennis Skinner, who shouted: ''So
he's got away with it, then,'' -- rose in a bid to continue discussion
on points of order, but the Speaker sought to defuse the exchanges.
Later, in a letter to Mr Peter Hain (Neath -- Lab.) -- the MP who made
the original formal complaint about Sir Jerry by writing to Miss
Boothroyd alleging there had been a breach of privilege -- the Speaker
further elaborated on her decision.
Referring to Sir Jerry's statement she said: ''It is my view that the
statement disposes of this unpleasant matter, and no interests of the
House would be served by a reference to the Privileges Committee.
''There are two reasons for this. In the first place, there is no
dispute about the facts. Secondly, it is the practice of the House to
accept without further demur the bona fides and candour of a Member who
makes a personal statement. That being so, it is hard to see what task
the Privileges Committee would be asked to do.
''You may of course take on your own account any parliamentary action
within our rules of order which you think appropriate.''
An angry Mr Hain said later: ''The public will not understand that,
having fudged immediate implementation of Nolan, the House has now
dodged taking disciplinary action to prevent amendments and questions
being smuggled in to conceal their commercial origins.
''To re-establish the integrity of Parliament MPs must clean up their
act speedily. Lord Nolan's recommendations must be quickly implemented
and cash for amendments must be stamped out. Otherwise, the public will
think all MPs are Arthur Daley spiv-alikes.''
Mr Sebastian Coe said in a statement afterwards that he now regarded
the matter as closed.
''I have today heard Sir Jerry Wiggin's apology to the House of
Commons. He has also apologised to me. I now regard the matter as
closed,'' he said.
However, senior back bencher Doug Hoyle, chairman of the Parliamentary
Labour Party and a member of the Privileges Committee, said that the
ruling was likely to produce a public outcry.

THE last resting place of Ibrox legend Bill Struth has been cleaned
up.
Mr Struth was manager of the Rangers team which lifted so many honours
after the end of the Second World War.
His gravestone is among several of historical interest discovered at
overgrown Craigton Cemetery, Glasgow.
They have been uncovered by volunteers who are getting financial
support from BT and the district council to turn the neglected cemetery
into a wildlife haven.
It was disclosed yesterday that Rangers has been making ground staff
available to tidy up the area around Bill Struth's grave.
Other graves include a possible relative of Robert Burns and soldiers
from as far back as the Boer War.
The main purpose of the project -- a collaboration between Scottish
Conservation Projects Trust and Glasgow District Council -- is to effect
environmental improvements in conjunction with the community.
Yesterday, pupils from Lourdes Secondary and Drumoyne Primary were
planting wild flowers at the approaches to the cemetery.
For some years, Craigton Cemetery has been allowed to deteriorate into
a wilderness.
However, it seems set for improvement thanks to the council and the
trust.
Council official, Ms June Bell, said: ''The project gained first prize
of #1000 in a competition run in Scotland by BT in connection with their
Environment Week.''

THE Thatcher embarrassment to the Prime Minister deepened last night
as a cryptic emergency statement from her office failed to cool the war
of words between them. Mr Major is still ''furious'' about her
allegation of ''misguided policies''. His predecessor claimed that she
is not seeking his removal.
Labour leader Tony Blair is expected today at Commons Questions to try
to draw out from Mr Major his exact reaction to her savage attack on the
Government's stance on Europe, law and order, welfare and other issues.
Mr Blair also wants to know whether it was Chancellor Major or Prime
Minister Thatcher who set the rate for Britain's disastrous entry to the
European exchange rate mechanism that heightened the recession.
Lady Thatcher's second volume of her memoirs has hit Mr Major
personally. They are to be serialised next weekend, but her profound
criticisms of his Premiership have been widely reported.
She claimed yesterday: ''The meaning of one particular sentence from
the 'The Path to Power' quoted in newspapers has been seriously
distorted because its full context has not been given.
''The sentence is: 'It is now, however, for others to take the action
required.''' Her office claims: ''This shows that Lady Thatcher is here
referring to developments in the West as a whole, not just Britain. It
also shows that Lady Thatcher is ruling herself out of the long-term
task of taking the action needed to deal with the problems she
outlines.''
This rushed statement, which made no mention of support for the
beleaguered Prime Minister, did little to cool the row.
It encouraged the Euro-maverick former Chancellor Norman Lamont to
reopen his developing strategy to persuade the Tories to consider
seriously the prospect of pulling out of Europe altogether.
He said yesterday: ''The question of Britain's membership of the EU
has not been settled for all time. It is provisional, not
unconditional.''
He chose to use a speech in Paris to warn Mr Major: ''It would not be
wise to expect the Conservative Party to support a new Treaty that goes
beyond Maastricht. The heart of the matter is that Britain joined the
EEC for the wrong reasons.''
Lady Thatcher's new book offers what she calls ''some thoughts about
putting these things right''.
Cabinet Ministers yesterday rallied to Mr Major, and they were led by
Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade. It was he who
pointed out that: ''When we went into the ERM, Mrs Thatcher was Prime
Minister, and I think that when history is written, the rate at which we
went in -- some would say too high -- was very much Mrs Thatcher's
personal view.''
He added that every Government had an inheritance: ''Inevitably, there
are things which could have been done differently''.
Mr Blair said yesterday that it is highly significant that it was
Margaret Thatcher and not Mr Major, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer
at the time, who made the ERM decision. ''I think that is a fairly
serious allegation which no doubt people will want to clear up.''
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo, darling of the Thatcherite
right, was in some difficulty trying to support both her and his Prime
Minister.
''I just do not believe that Mrs Thatcher is attacking the leadership
of John Major. She is concerned with policy, but I don't think the
policies are as different as people have made out.
He claimed that there was ''very strong continuity'' on Europe between
the position Margaret Thatcher took and that which John Major has been
taking.''Mr Portillo added: ''Of course, the entry to the ERM was the
decision of the Prime Minister of the day, but I don't see much point in
raking up the past.''
The whole episode has provided another jolt for Mr Major already beset
by trouble over the Nolan proposals for establishing a code of conduct
for Parliament and the oncoming Scott findings on the arms-to-Iraq
affair which also involve Lady Thatcher's time in office.
Last night, even Thatcher supporters said her statement did not go far
enough. One MP told her bluntly to ''shut up.''
Tory MP Nigel Evans said: ''I'm one of Thatcher's children. Margaret
Thatcher was one of the greatest Prime Ministers this country has ever
had.
''But I do not believe she rises in the estimation of people in this
country by carping and criticising the Prime Minister.
Euro-sceptic Tory James Cran said Lady Thatcher's statement just
showed she had to be more careful what she said.
''She has done us no service at all. Shut up. We've all got to shut
up, her included,'' he said.
''It is unhelpful. It seems to me that former Prime Ministers who've
had to put up with that sort of treatment before should have learned
from their experience and be rather more understanding to their
successor.''

CHILDREN as young as 11 are arriving at school with hangovers or still
''pie-eyed'' with drink, teachers claimed yesterday.
Leaders of the Professional Association of Teachers said alcohol,
tobacco, cannabis and solvents were far greater threats to children's
health than hard drugs.
The association wants tougher regulation on the sale of alcohol and
tobacco, and a ban on advertising near schools.
It blamed parents who drank or smoked heavily for undermining the
Government's health messages.
Deputy general secretary Ms Jackie Miller said: ''Some children are
getting a very confused message.
''Too many parents tell them drinking and smoking are bad for their
health, but then do it themselves.
''So when parents say drugs are bad for their health as well, it isn't
surprising children don't take the message.
''It just seems like adults saying, once again, 'Here is something
else enjoyable that you can't do'. So they do it.''
Ms Miller was speaking after publication of a survey of nearly 500
members about drugs in their schools.
It found evidence of hard drugs like heroin or cocaine was
''statistically insignificant''.
But nearly seven out of 10 secondary schools and one in 10 primary
schools reported problems with pupils drinking.
Youngsters were smoking in almost all secondary schools and more than
20% of 10 primary schools.
On tobacco and alcohol, Ms Miller said: ''We assumed there would be a
problem with children at the younger end of secondary school, who might
appear old enough to buy these things legally.
''But we did not expect to find teachers talking of 11-year-olds
coming into school pie-eyed, or hung over.
''There is no way in the world these youngsters could have been
innocently sold alcohol. Shopkeepers must have known they were breaking
the law.''
The association wants the Government to take ''urgent steps to
encourage parents to adopt a more responsible attitude to the task of
parenting''.

<TEXT>
THE Bill aimed at remedying problems with the controversial Child
Support Agency cleared its Commons stages last night.
MPs gave the Child Support Bill a third reading by 208 votes to 46, a
Government majority of 162.
The measure, which includes an appeal system to allow ''departures''
from the much-criticised rigid financial formula for settlements, now
goes to the Lords.
Also included is recognition of so-called ''clean-break'' settlements
-- the lack of which was one of the principal grievances of angry
fathers.
The changes were brought forward after a wave of public criticism and
a highly-critical report on the workings of the CSA by the cross-party
Commons select committee on the Ombudsman.
The committee accused the CSA of wrongly identifying missing parents,
poor procedures, failure to answer letters and subjecting families to
lengthy and stressful delays.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar said last night that the
CSA was ''an administrative nightmare'' that needed to be reformed.
''It has arguably missed many of its social targets,'' he said,
claiming the agency sometimes ''added insult to perceived injury''.
Mr Dewar highlighted figures from the Chief Child Support Officer
which showed that in 1188 child maintenance assessments made by the
agency, ''only 157 could positively be said to have been as accurate as
they should have been''.
Calling for the creation of an impartial Child Support Advisory
Committee, Mr Dewar warned there could still be ''difficult times
ahead'' for the CSA.''Monitoring and adjusting is something that will be
key here.''
Junior Social Security Minister Alistair Burt insisted the Government
valued consultation and he listed organisations which Ministers had
talked to about the changes being introduced.
It was not clear how the committee suggested by Labour could assist,
Mr Burt said.
Ms Liz Lynne, for the Liberal Democrats, said: ''This Bill is a sorry
disappointment.''
She said the existing Act was not working as it did not take into
account individual circumstances and added that the Bill ''tinkers at
the edges and does not address the real problems''.
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley attacked Liberal Democrats, who
he said, had ''associated their party with some of the nastiest elements
in British politics''.
He claimed they joined forces with people and groups ''who sought to
overthrow the Child Support Agency''.
Mr Lilley told the House: ''Overall the changes, I believe, will
benefit children, both parents and the taxpayer.''

THE Government may clamp down on fathers who deny parentage of a child
in order to delay paying maintenance.
During Commons debate on the Child Support Bill, Social Security
junior Minister James Arbuthnot announced there would be a consultation

More than 200 cases have gone through courts with fathers denying
responsibility for a child. Only a few have turned out to be correct and
payment of maintenance, although backdated, has been delayed.

Yesterday at the base, the Royal Navy joined local authorities and

The proposed complex on the Duchess Fields in Helensburgh includes
floodlit outdoor sports pitches, improvements to existing cricket fields
and athletics tracks as well as gymnasiums and squash courts.
It is hoped the Millennium Commission will contribute #6m towards the

MORE than 100 local people will meet in Stirling later today to begin
planning the future of the decentralisation of council services in the
area.
They will be taking part in an area committee conference which will be
attended by the leaders and chief executives of the new unitary
authorities.
Four area committees, covering Denny and Bonnybridge, Hillfoots,
Stirling, and Grangemouth, were introduced a year ago by
Labour-controlled Central Regional Council. It is due to be replaced in
April next year by single-tier councils for Stirling, Clackmannan, and
Falkirk.
The committees -- which have been praised as a successful and
effective initiative -- bring together local people, councillors, and
service managers, as equal members, every six to eight weeks to discuss
and decide solutions to local problems.
Under the council reorganisation legislation, the 29 new unitary
councils are each obliged to publish a scheme of decentralisation by
April 1997.
One of the aims of the day-long conference is to plan the future of
community participation in local government.
Central region leader Corrie McChord, who will also lead the new
Stirling Council, said: ''The conference is an excellent opportunity for
the new councils to benefit from the Central experience and set the
agenda for their own decentralisation policies.
''It is almost a ready-made consultation exercise, with the
communities themselves providing information on their needs, views, and
experiences.''
The conference takes place in the Council Chambers at Old Viewforth,
Stirling.
Meanwhile, the new unitary Midlothian Council yesterday agreed a
committee structure which will combine responsibility for housing and
social work under one social services committee. A separate education
committee is planned and a community initiatives committee will play a
major role in the formulation of decentralisation plans.

A SENIOR Scots Tory has called on the Prime Minister to push
Government agencies north of the Border.
Mr Arthur Bell, chairman of the Scottish Tory Reform Group, has given
Mr Major a shopping list of suggestions that might help him. It would
mean the transfer of thousands of jobs to Scotland.
Mr Bell, in a letter to the Prime Minister, suggests moving:
* The fisheries division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
to Aberdeen;
* The Meat and Livestock Commission from Milton Keynes to Dumfries or
Dundee;
* The Intervention Board from Reading to Edinburgh;
* The Ministry of Defence's Met Office from Berkshire to Scotland;
* Selling Britain's food through Perth rather than Covent Garden; and,
* Setting up a Scottish Civil Aviation Authority in Glasgow.
Mr Bell also says there should be a Scottish Broadcasting Corporation,
Press Complaints Commission, Advertising Standards Authority, Office of
Fair Trading, and a Scottish Audit Commission.
His final suggestion, which he urges the Policy Unit at No 10 to
consider ''seriously'', is partial relocation of the Treasury itself to
Scotland.

AN English MP yesterday accused the Government of ''playing politics''
with the #5500m Trident missile submarine refit contract to try to win
votes in Thursday's Perth and Kinross by-election.
Mr David Jamieson, the Devonport Labour MP, said he was alarmed that
the contract was apparently being put in doubt two years after its award
to the Plymouth yard in preference to its Scottish rival at Rosyth.
Speaking in Plymouth, he said: ''I am fearful that vital defence
policy is being driven by the short-term political needs of the
Conservatives with the Perth by-election looming this week.
''The contract is of huge significance not only to Plymouth but to the
whole region. We need to know exactly what the Government's position is.
It seems to be playing politics with people's jobs purely as a vote
catcher.''
A statement by Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman at Rosyth
last week seemed to indicate that the Government was about to do a
U-turn on nuclear submarine refit work.
Under the terms of the decision to put all Trident and Royal Navy
hunter-killer submarine work to Devonport, Rosyth was to be relegated to
refitting 18 surface warships over the next 12 years.
However, doubts over Devonport's ability to qualify for a nuclear
safety certificate to allow it to carry out the work mean at least two
hunter-killers will go to Rosyth meantime.
There are also fears that the limestone on which the Plymouth yard is
built cannot be reinforced at an economic cost to pass the stringent
safety regulations for the much larger Trident boats. The first, HMS
Vanguard, is due for its initial refit in 1999.
The Herald revealed the problem exclusively a month ago amid categoric
Government denials that the contract for nuclear refits was in any
doubt.
Mr Freeman then visited Rosyth last Wednesday to discuss privatisation
of the yard and admitted that efforts would have to be made to avoid
''disruption of the docking of nuclear-powered submarines''.
He added that this might include ''the possibility of deferring the
ending of nuclear work at Rosyth previously planned for 1997''. He also
admitted that Devonport needed strengthening and upgrading of its
nuclear docks.
The most likely immediate scenario is that the aircraft carrier HMS
Ark Royal will go to Devonport as a sop for losing the overhaul of the
next two nuclear patrol submarines. An assessment will then have to be
made as to whether the yard can achieve the safety standard necessary
for Trident.
A senior West Country Tory MP, Mr Robert Hicks, said last night that
he remained convinced that Trident would still come to Plymouth.
Nevertheless, he said he would be pressing Defence Ministers for more
information.
The Plymouth Sutton Tory, Mr Gary Streeter, said he believed Mr
Freeman's remarks were intended to put pressure on DML, Devonport's
management, to give the best possible deal for the contract.
''There can be no question of a U-turn,'' he said. That would result
in a catastrophe for the Government in the South-west.''

FIREFIGHTERS investigating a water leak found an emaciated alsatian
feeding on the remains of another dog, a court was told yesterday.
Its owner, Michelle Keane, 20, was found guilty of six offences under
the 1911 Animals Protection Act of causing unnecessary suffering to both
dogs and abandoning them between December 4 and January 21.
She claimed when she appeared before Enfield magistrates that she had
gone away leaving a friend in charge of the animals.
The alsatian was found gnawing on the jawbone of a six-month-old
Staffordshire bull terrier cross on January 4.
The property in Enfield was empty and covered in dog excrement, the
court heard.
In an upstairs bedroom, a firefighter found the very thin alsatian on
a bed and on the floor was the jawbone of a dog along with a collar. The
alsatian weighed 9.8kg -- half its normal body weight.
Feeding bowls were found downstairs in the kitchen along with empty
tins of dog food in a plastic bag in a kitchen cupboard.
Constable Alexander McKennany interviewed Keane, who said she had
lived at the address for a year and had partially moved out.
In evidence, she said she had an ambition to be an RSPCA inspector and
had applied to the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, Blue Cross, and
the British Veterinary Nursing Association.
She had stayed at her mother's house nearby on December 16 for a
couple of nights then went ''up north'' for Christmas, leaving her dogs
in the care of an Irish friend, Angela O'Neill, a woman she had known
for five years.
Miss O'Neill was an ex-heroin addict and hoped to remain in England.
She told Keane she would stay until the end of January and was happy to
look after the dogs. Keane said she left #100 for dog food.
She told police she did not know Miss O'Neill's address or where she
could contact her but said she was a good friend who she trusted to look
after her dogs.
Mr David Grant, a vet, estimated that it would take at least three to
four weeks for the alsatian to get into the state in which it was found
without any food.
As it had eaten the terrier's carcass, it had survived longer. ''It
was probably within a week of death,'' he added.
The surviving dog was later featured on Rolf Harris's Animal Hospital
TV show.
The hearing was adjourned until June 12 for pre-sentence reports.

THE bank account of the Stirling of Keir family looks set to benefit
by more than #1m after antique dealers from across the world began
bidding yesterday for a share of the family silver.
The current laird of the Stirling of Keir dynasty, Mr Archibald
Stirling -- former husband of Diana Rigg and nephew of SAS founder David
Stirling -- looked on in disbelief as, bid after bid, family heirlooms
sold for well over their asking price.
Auctioneers Christie's said that takings at the end of the first day
of the sale -- being held in two marquees at Keir roundabout, on the
outskirts of Dunblane -- stood at #941,556, the amount expected for the
entire three-day event.
Standing at the back of the makeshift auction room on part on his
Perthshire estate, Mr Stirling only stayed for 10 minutes of bidding
before leaving with a look of happy amazement on his face.
The landowner last week announced he was putting more than 1400 items,
from a 500-year-old collection of antiques, up for sale because he was
tired of keeping them locked away in storage.
He also revealed that what might be a sad day for the Stirling of Keir
family would be a happy day for the taxman, though he said he believed
his predecessors would not be against the sale.
Yesterday the taxman had reason to smile as more than 100 dealers from
across Britain and Ireland filled the huge auction tent, while
Christie's staff relayed bids from American and Continental collectors
on private 'phone lines.
For lot after lot, both private collectors and dealers in the tent not
only matched the values Christie's had put on each item, but often more
than doubled the asking price.
Among the top prices fetched included #58,000 for a George III gilted
over-mantel mirror, which Christie's staff said was in need of repair
and had valued at #20,000, and a 19th century marble sculpture of a
bullock which sold for #26,450 even though experts had valued it between
#3000 to #5000.
Last night Christie's spokeswoman, Ms Victoria Gibson, said: ''The
sale has attracted a lot of international interest and is going better
than we could have hoped for.
''The thing that seems to be attracting dealers most is the history of
each item up for auction.
''We know it all came from the one family, and a famous family at
that. When dealers buy a piece they know its history will bump up the
price when they sell it on.
''And as a lot of the items Mr Stirling is selling are in need of some
repair they know that once their restoration experts have looked at
them, they will be able to sell them for a much higher price.''
She added: ''I think it is quite a sad day for Mr Stirling in the
sense that he grew up with most of the auction items around him, and
they trigger family memories for him.
''But at the same time I think he will be very pleased when he sees
how much money has been made by the time the sale closes on Wednesday
evening.''

TRANSPORT Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney yesterday angrily refused to
answer a Labour charge in the Commons that he ''bent'' rules to favour a
rail consortium led by former Tory Cabinet Minister Lord Parkinson.
He said he would not ''flirt with the law'' by discussing confidential
documents.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher based his attack on secret
papers he said he received about the handling of bids to build the
#3000m Channel Tunnel Rail Link.
It was reported in The Independent newspaper last week that the papers
showed that Eurorail, led by former Transport Secretary Lord Parkinson,
had been allowed to proceed with its bid despite its initial failure to
comply with the rules of the tendering process.
It claimed that Eurorail, one of four consortia bidding for the
scheme, was then asked to re-bid in line with the rules and did so.
Yesterday, Mr Meacher asked Dr Mawhinney: ''Will you explain why, in
bidding for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, you permitted a bid to proceed
from Eurorail which broke the terms of the tender document?
''The rules of the process which were published last year state
unequivocally that all the tenderers must submit a document on the basis
of the reference specification.
''Eurorail failed to do so and there is no mention in the rules of any
tenderers being allowed to submit a fresh bid.
''Is it not clear that you bent the rules by allowing Eurorail to make
a fresh bid because Eurorail consortium is led by one of the
Government's friends and associates, Lord Parkinson?''
Dr Mawhinney retorted: ''As I would have thought you understood, all
these documents are commercial and in confidence.''
As Labour MPs jeered, he added: ''I hope Hansard will record that
surge of contempt for legal contracts signed by those who have a desire
to take part in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link project.
''Unlike you, I am not going to flirt with the law in this regard.''

THE man who will have the challenging task of handing out #15m
annually to charities across Scotland has been appointed by the National
Lottery Charities Board.
He is Mr John Rafferty, 42, a Glaswegian, who has been recruited from
the Archdiocese of Glasgow, where he has been spearheading its business
development strategy.
The appointment, which will be announced officially today, is in line
with the NLCB's pledge that its distribution of grants for charity will
be delivered locally.
Along with the Committee for Scotland, Mr Rafferty will be responsible
for ensuring that the #15m is administered ''fairly and efficiently for
the benefit of charities across Scotland''.
Mr Rafferty estimates that in Scotland there are potentially between
8000 and 10,000 charitable organisations eligible to apply for the
board's help.
He said: ''The establishment of a Scottish committee and my
appointment forms a key part of the strategy of the NLCB, to make sure
that its grants programme is carried out in a way which clearly meets
needs in Scotland.
''I am looking forward to working with the Scottish committee to build
an effective team to undertake the major task of distributing
significant sums of money to the Scottish voluntary sector.
''Already the board has carried out extensive consultations to
establish its priorities. First among these is to assist in tackling
poverty in Scotland. We will make our first grants in October.''
Mr Rafferty said there had already been a positive response from
Scottish organisations in the first six days they had been allowed to
approach the Scottish committee. In that time, around 591 organisations
had been sent out grant application packs.
He said: ''We are predicting a high take-up in Scotland, which is
something we want to encourage.''
Mr Rafferty said the minimum grant would be #500. ''There will,
however, be no maximum figure.
''Big voluntary organisations will already be thinking of applying but
we are committed to reaching out to smaller organisations and we want to
encourage them to apply.''
Mr Rafferty will take up his job on June 12, at the board's new
offices in Edinburgh.
During his tenure at the archdiocese, he led the initiative which
successfully addressed the serious financial difficulties faced by the
church. In 1992, it had debts of #9.8m. By the end of this year, this
figure will have fallen to less than #4m. Mr Rafferty said yesterday he
was confident that, by 1997, the debt would have been written off.
Mr Rafferty has long-established links with the voluntary sector in
Scotland. He was director of the Volunteer Centre in Strathclyde for
more than 10 years and, in 1988, became chief executive of the Scottish
Foundation for Social and Economic Development.
Mr Timothy Hornsby, chief executive of the NLCB for the UK, said Mr
Rafferty was a marvellous addition to its management team.
''We look forward to the contribution he will make, not only in
Scotland, but also to policy and practices throughout the board's UK
operations.''
Mr Graham Bowie, chairman of the board's Scotland Committee, said:
''Mr Rafferty brings with him varied experience of the voluntary sector
and considerable experience of grant making to what is a challenging
task for the board in Scotland.''

MR John Robb will be paid #100,000 a year as part-time chairman of the
yet to be named holding company that will control Scottish Nuclear and
Nuclear Electric in the run-up to privatisation next year.
However, the former chairman of the Wellcome pharmaceuticals group
yesterday indicated there would not be many jobs created, adding: ''We
are not talking of a large bureaucracy.'' The implication is that
perhaps 100 jobs would be created.
He bridled at the suggestion that the Scottish headquarters would be
just a brass plate, adding: ''I will not be party to any reduction in
the Government's commitment to a Scottish headquarters.''
Mr Robb, who was born in Edinburgh, expects to be spending almost all
his time working on the flotation of the nuclear generators. He will
continue to live in Surrey.
As he received an estimated #2.2m pay-off from Glaxo after it took
over Wellcome earlier this year, he said money was not the driving force
and that his salary would have no additional perks or share options.

GREENPEACE activists were last night ''ready and waiting'' for Shell's
next attempt to remove them from the Brent Spar installation, which they
have occupied for three weeks, after the oil company's first abortive
landing bid.
Last night, from on board the Brent Spar, Greenpeace spokesman Jan
Rispens said: ''The Stadive is still standing by and is about 20 metres
away. We believe they are waiting for an improvement in the weather
before they try again. We will try to prevent them boarding by having
people standing where they might try to land baskets.
''If they do succeed in putting people on board we will disappear and
chain ourselves to the platform.''
Mr Rispens said that a number of the protesters had manufactured
''ingenious'' metal structures inside which they could chain themselves.
This, he added, would at least considerably delay their departure from
Brent Spar.
''We have quite long experience in these things,'' he said. ''We know
what to do and how to resist passively.''
He accepted that it was likely that Shell would eventually succeed in
removing all the protesters -- there are ''about a dozen'' -- but they
were committed to attempting to remain until Shell abandoned its plans
to dump the Brent Spar, and the toxic waste Greenpeace claims it
contains, in the Atlantic. The plan has Government approval and work on
it was due to start yesterday.
''This could set the precedent for hundreds of other platforms over
the next 10 years,'' Mr Rispens said.
He said that as yet they had no plans to move to any further
installations after the Brent Spar operation, but warned: ''As long as
there is dumping in the North Sea, whatever it is, Greenpeace will fight
against it.''
The weather yesterday was poor with force seven winds and four metre
waves.
''Morale is very high,'' Mr Rispens said. ''We had very good
motivation for the past three weeks because we have had a good cook and
the food has been very good quality. We can stay here for a long time.
It seems from their first attempt to board that Shell are not as well
prepared as we are, so we are even more motivated.''
Shell's first attempt to end what has been, at the least, a highly
successful publicity campaign by Greenpeace, failed because of the high
winds.
The Stadive, which dwarves the Brent Spar, pulled alongside at around
2.30am yesterday with police and sheriff officers ready to board the
installation.
Shell says the vessel moved alongside ''as scheduled to begin final
preparations for the disposal of the Spar''.
The statement continued: ''Initial boarding of the installation from
the Stadive was postponed on safety grounds due to strong winds and
forecast worsening weather.''
The Brent Spar was illuminated by floodlights on Stadive as an attempt
was made to extend a crane over to the installation. Shell apparently
planned to transport men on by basket, a commonly used technique in the
North Sea.
''The sea itself has granted us a stay of execution,'' said
Greenpeace's Chris Rose.

TWO-THIRDS of the people of Harris are opposed to the establishment of
Europe's largest coastal superquarry at Lingerbay, in the south of the
island, according to results of a referendum published yesterday.
Two years ago, there was support on the island for Redland Aggregates'
proposal to remove 600 million tonnes of anorthosite from the mountain
Roineabhal.
Harris Council of Social Service commissioned the Electoral Reform
Society to conduct a second poll and announced yesterday it had
attracted an 82.7% response, with 1013 (67.7%) voting against the
development and 483 (32.3%) for.
This marks an almost complete reversal of the position in June 1993,
when the first referendum showed that 62.1% were in favour. The overall
participation two years ago, however, was lower, at 60.9%.
In October, when The Herald and BBC's Eorpa programme polled 22% of
the island's over-16 population, it was clear that opinion had begun to
slip away, with 36% in favour, 36% against, and 27% undecided.
Mrs Morag Munro, secretary of the Council of Social Service and the
Quarry Benefits Group, said last night: ''I think the real story here is
the response to the poll. At 82.7%, it must be unprecedented. The people
had more information this time from the public inquiry and felt they
were better able to make up their minds.''
Lewis Councillor Alasdair Nicolson, who was one of only three
councillors who opposed the development two years ago, said last night
that Redland Aggregates should now withdraw the application.
A Redland spokesman, however, said the company had been consistent in
its view that the development would benefit all concerned. He was
disappointed that the referendum had taken place before the end of the
public inquiry.
Mr Donald M Mackay, convener of Western Isles Islands Council, who
chaired the council's development services committee in June 1993 when
it conditionally supported Redland's planning application, said
yesterday he accepted that there had been a shift in opinion.
However, he added: ''The council has already indicated that it wishes
to reconsider its position on Lingerbay.''
Mr Mackay said that, ultimately, it would be up to the Secretary of
State to decide.
Mr Ian Wilson, the Dunblane-based mineral consultant who holds the
mineral rights to Lingerbay, said he was not surprised by the results.
''The anti-quarry activists have had two years to mobilise opinion
against the quarry; two years of misleading statements; misleading local
fishermen over issues like ballast water, dust, and noise; misleading
islanders that it is the superquarry or other developments.''
The first occasion councillors will have to reconsider Lingerbay will
be at the next meeting of the development services committee on June 7.

A FORMER Scottish soldier yesterday broke a silence that has spanned
half a century to tell how he unmasked the Second World War's biggest
mass-murderer.
Mr Tom Selvester, 86, a retired police inspector, who lives in
Edinburgh, said it would be 50 years ago today that a small dishevelled
man with a bogus eye patch was brought before him in the civilian
interrogation camp near Luneburg, 28 miles outside the city of Hamburg.
On that fateful, cold day in early summer, Mr Selvester was a young
captain in the Pioneer Corps.
His job was to weed out Nazis trying to cover up their past.
At exactly 2pm, three German prisoners were marched before him.
''The first man to enter my office was small, ill-looking, with a
patch over one eye,'' he said. ''The other two were tall, well-built,
and soldier-like.''
Captain Selvester ordered that the German trio be separated and it was
then that the small man, left on his own, removed the patch and
announced:
''Ich bin Herr Heinrich Himmler.''
Himmler, the second most powerful man in the Third Reich who was
primarily responsible for the extermination of the Jews, had been picked
up with his companions two days earlier by British soldiers at a bridge
near Bremervorde, 36 miles north of Bremen.
He had claimed to be a postman but could not maintain the pretence.
Mr Selvester said: ''At first, I could not believe my ears and I
thought that we had some kind of nutter here.
''But as soon as he took off the patch and put on spectacles, I knew I
had my man.
''However, it was quite difficult to believe he was the same person as
the man who had behaved so arrogantly up until only few weeks before.''
Here was the man, with the blood of millions on his hands, who had
only recently broadcast his ''offer'' of unconditional surrender to the
Western Allies.
When his ''offer' had been contemptuously dismissed, he had
disappeared from sight among a flood of refugees.
Mr Selvester added: ''As they say these days, this definitely was my
15 minutes of fame. But as I saw it at the time I was only doing my
duty, and I still think that.
''When I realised that here was the most wanted Nazi of them all, a
feeling of pure elation spread through me.
''My unit had, after all, picked up some medium-ranking officers
earlier but here was the big fish in my net.
''It was when I removed him from the other two, who were obviously his
burly bodyguards, that he thought that the game was up. He came clean
and confessed to his true identity.''
Captain Selvester telephoned British Army HQ at Luneburg to tell them
that the most-wanted of all the Nazi arch-criminals was in custody.
At first, no-one at HQ would believe him.
He said: ''As the news began to sink in, I was warned that I would be
beaten to a pulp if I was joking and I was given orders -- including
putting an extra guard on him.''
Along with some of the soldiers from his 40-strong Pioneer Corps unit
at 031 Civilian Interrogation Camp, Captain Selvester then removed
Himmler's clothes.
He was then searched for poison-phials which they knew were carried by
top-ranking Nazis. Two brass cases were found -- one containing a
blue-coloured glass phial and one which was empty.
They knew that the second small capsule must be in his mouth but did
not want to make a move in case he swallowed it. Himmler was then
transferred to Second Army Surrender HQ in Luneburg.
It was there that an Army medical officer, Captain Jimmy Wells, asked
him to open his mouth. However, as the late Dr Wells, an English GP in
civilian life, tried to remove the phial, Himmler bit him hard and broke
the capsule, and subsequently fell unconscious and died around 11pm.

Nae day sae dark;
nae wind sae bare.
Nae grund sae stour wi stane.
But licht comes through;
a sang is there;
a glint o' grass is green.
A WONDERFUL statue by David Annand in Perth's main shopping
thoroughfare celebrates William Soutar's great poem about hope in
adversity.
A man, tortured and blindfold clutches a shining circular bar in
despair, while another leans back against it, at ease with himself.
Conservative candidate John Godfrey outwardly continues to present a
passable impersonation of the latter but it is hard not to believe that
inside lurks the other, for these are dark days indeed for his
by-election campaign and he will look in vain for a glint of green on
the stony ground.
To most observers, his campaign has been astonishingly inept from the
outset. It struck an immediate tone of stridency, wrapped in the Union
flag in a manner which does few favours north of the Border.
The Scottish Nationalists were like Nazis, the Conservatives were the
party of British patriotism, VE Day was the proprietorial property of
the Tories, and the SNP candidate was never referred to as anything so
courteous as Ms Cunningham.
Instead, she was ''Republican Rose'', and was yesterday dubbed the
''most radical left-wing MP at Westminster'' should she win.
This was a high-risk strategy, a long-odds bet. Mr Godfrey staked #33
on himself at 66-1 the other day. His nominated charity should not count
on the winnings.
Yet, the candidate is adamantine in his insistence that the campaign
has gone swimmingly and according to plan. It was, after all, his own
plan.
''It is very much my campaign,'' he said. ''I talked through my ideas
with Leith Links (Scottish Tory HQ) but it is my campaign, I have the
final veto.''
He looked at the electoral arithmetic of the last General Election and
decided that the campaign would target the SNP. ''In 1992, we did well
by defending the Union in historical and emotional terms. I wanted to
make more of an economic argument.''
However, although he has trotted out the figures on identifiable
Government expenditure in Scotland, tax revenues and so forth, this
rather grim number crunching has been overshadowed by the flag waving.
As one of his direct mailshots concluded in a handwritten postscript:
''Be a patriot not a Nationalist.''
He betrays no sign that he sees anything inconsistent in this message.
When it was put to him that for many mainstream, even Conservative
Scots, the sea of Union flag-waving hooray Henrys, familiar from the
Last Night of the Proms, was not a pretty sight, he and his wife
Charlotte seemed genuinely suprised.
The argument that the Tories could push the merits of a partnership of
equal sovereign nations, while wearing distinctly Scottish clothes, cut
little ice.
Of sailing so clearly under the Union Jack, he said: ''I think we are
doing exactly the right thing. All the responses I have been getting
from Conservative supporters have been very strong. It has given them
something to rally around, bringing life to the campaign, and if that
means that I am appealing to my party's bedrock support then so be it. A
lot have said thank goodness you have come out fighting instead of
apologising.
''I am frankly relieved to be fighting a Scottish by-election rather
than an English one at the moment. I don't think we have been arguing
from an English perspective on behalf of Scotland, for the strongest
position is within the Union. We are not shy of saying that.''
What about his ''fighting for Queen and country'' language?
''I think that's absolutely fair. A lot of SNP voters seem to think
their party just want to give their country more power, rather than
breaking up what we've got.
''Roseanna Cunningham is an avowed republican, so my comments are
fair. For example, if I had been a Euro-sceptic, opponents would say I
was out of step with the Prime Minister, and make something of that.
''Roseanna Cunningham is in some ways so radical that it takes even
the Labour Party by surprise -- and I suspect that was all part of the
problem over her selection process.''
The candidate still continues to talk up his prospects and play down
some of what has seemed to others to be campaign blunders but, in the
inevitable post-mortem examination, questions will have to be asked high
up within the Tory Party.
Having gone on the stump to paint a picture of its main opponent as a
dangerous republican socialist with Nazi leanings, she is going to
slaughter them in the poll.
Was Mr Godfrey briefed well enough? Why did no-one with expertise in
this area oversee his campaign? What was Raymond Robertson doing as his
campaign ''minder''? Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind at one point
mentioned that Mr Robertson looked like a Securicor guard. What the
candidate needed was a shrewd analyst, not a bodyguard.
Above all, when the campaign began to come apart at the seams, someone
should have noticed. The setbacks may have been 90% unavoidable locally
-- mid-term blues, party splits, sleaze, taxation, railways, nuclear
privatisation, the list is endless. But who carries the can for the 10%?
Mr Godfrey has stood on a platform and defended the poll tax as a good
thing, admitted that he would have voted for the full VAT on domestic
fuel. It has been impossible to detect the slightest bit of policy on
which the candidate differs by even a hair's breadth from his party
leadership. Ditto the Labour candidate.
This rather points towards the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's
observation about party clones and may explain part of the appeal of Ms
Cunningham, whose view on the demerits of the monarchy at least shows
her capable of independent thought.
However, Mr Godfrey has recovered before in times of adversity. The
32-year-old lad o' pairts from Spean Bridge had a bleak day some years
ago as a merchant banker in London, when he was in charge of his
company's interests as leading underwriters for the share flotation of
BP. The stock market crashed at an inopportune moment and they took the
proverbial bath to the tune of many millions of pounds. Bad arithmetic,
external factors, is there a parallel here?
The candidate remains determinedly upbeat. He will be fighting the
redrawn seat at the next General Election, he promises. He is unbowed by
his daily battering at the hands of the media.
''I have been on the ropes at one point but I feel I have managed to
get back in the ring each day,'' he said.
William Soutar put it rather better:
Wha hasna thol'd his thorter'd hours.
And kent, whan they were by,
the tenderness o' life that fleurs,
Rock-fast in misery.

THE grandson of a climber who disappeared on Mount Everest 71 years
ago, has finally fulfilled his family's dream of scaling the world's
highest peak.
In 1924, the crudely equipped George Leigh Mallory and Andrew Irvine
vanished, sparking decades of speculation that they may have been the
first to conquer Everest.
The Times newspaper yesterday reported that Mallory's 35-year-old
grandson George, from Melbourne, Australia, climbed the mountain
following the same route on the Tibetan side as his predecessor.
He was one of 13 climbers on an American expedition to commemorate the
ill-fated 1924 attempt. His father, John Mallory, who was just two years
old when his own father disappeared on the mountain, was at base camp on
Rongbuk glacier.
New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tensing Norgay were the first
to scale Everest on May 29, 1953.

THE first sign of a possible breakthrough in the NHS pay dispute came
last night when management agreed to reopen pay negotiations ''with no
preconditions''.
This response from Mr Ken Jarrold, NHS director of human resources, to
a request for talks from Unison was welcomed by Mr Bob Abberley, the
union's head of health.
''We are pleased the employers have seen sense in the face of a
massive rejection,'' he said, adding he would be interested to hear more
about reports of management ready to offer ''local bargaining within a
national framework''.
Earlier, he had set out a timetable for a summer of discontent over
NHS pay after a 91% rejection of the Government's pay offer in a
consultative ballot of its 440,000 health service members.
Voting in Scotland was even more emphatic, with a 93.7% rejection from
a 51% turnout.
Last night, union leaders in Scotland were speculating on how Mr
Jarrold's counterpart at the Scottish Health Department, Mr Mike
Sibbald, would follow Mr Jarrold's move. He is regarded as having taken
a harder line than Mr Jarrold during the dispute.
Before moving to a strike ballot, Unison is to delay for six weeks.
This will give it time to co-ordinate ballots and give the Tories a
chance to reopen national pay negotiations.
Faced with a resounding rejection of the 1% national offer and the
prospect of up to a further 2% negotiated locally, Unison's health
service executive decided to move for a full ballot for industrial
action up to and including strike action. This will take place on July
5.
This timetable will accommodate the Royal College of Nursing's ballot
on a proposed rule change to open the way for industrial action.
Negotiations are also to reopen today between NHS managers and the Royal
College of Midwives.
The RCN will have the result of its rule change ballot by June 29.

<HEADLINE>Mother who lied for husband is freed on appeal</HEADLINE>

A MOTHER of three young children, jailed for two months last Friday
for lying to police about who was driving the family car in a road
accident, was yesterday freed by the Court of Appeal.
Mrs Patricia Whitehead headed home for a reunion with her sons -- and
the task of explaining to them where she had been for three days.
Her husband, Mr David Whitehead, 47, who is said to have persuaded her
to tell her false story to the police, remained in prison.
His plea for leave to appeal against his four-month sentence was
refused by an appeal judge at a separate private hearing.
His lawyers were last night planning to renew his application before a
full appeal court, possibly later this week.
Mrs Whitehead, 32, walked free after three judges held that, although
attempting to pervert the course of justice almost always attracted a
custodial sentence, the balance was tipped in her favour by the plight
of her young sons.
Lord Justice Swinton Thomas said: ''The courts are always very
reluctant to send the mother of young children to prison, although
sometimes it is unavoidable.
''Clearly it is desirable that a mother should be permitted to look
after her children.''
The judge, sitting with Mr Justice Harrison and Mrs Justice Steel,
said that factor was ''decisive'' and substituted a 50-hour community
service order for the jail term.
There was no word of criticism for Mr Justice Ian Kennedy, whose
decision to jail the couple at Winchester Crown Court caused an angry
reaction among lawyers and prison reform groups.
Lord Justice Swinton Thomas said it had been wrong of press reports to
refer to a ''minor lapse in integrity'' and ''telling fibs to the
police'' over a small traffic accident.
He said: ''The courts have always taken a serious view of offences of
perverting the course of justice because they undermine the rule of law
. . . ''
American-born Mrs Whitehead, who runs an off-licence and is a Cub
Scout leader, told police she was driving when her husband's car was in
collision with a motor cycle near their home in Brockenhurst, Hampshire,
last August.
In fact, Mr Whitehead, a computer programmer and Sunday school
teacher, was at the wheel. His wife was at home at the time.
Mr Whitehead had mistakenly feared he faced a driving ban under the
totting-up procedure, which would have stopped him driving to London
each day to earn much-needed money in the face of serious financial
problems.
A week later, the couple confessed to the police.
Yesterday, Lord Justice Swinton Thomas pointed out that Mr Whitehead
had involved his car passengers -- his parents, his sister, and their
two French guests -- in the deception after the accident.
The offence was not committed on the spur of the moment. The plan was
''hatched'' in the hour between the accident and the arrival of police
at the couple's home.
The story was maintained six days later during police interviews. It
was when they learned of the strength of the evidence against them that
they confessed voluntarily.
He said the court accepted that Mrs Whitehead was drawn into the
offence by her husband and acted out of a misguided sense of loyalty.
Last night, Mrs Whitehead travelled to the Isle of Wight to be with
her sons, Ian, nine, Christian, seven, and Alexander, five. Thanking
those who helped win her freedom, she said: ''I am just so relieved to
see my sons again.''
They had been staying at their grandparents' home at Shanklin while
lawyers tried to free their mother.
Mother-in-law Lavinia Whitehead said: ''Patti is absolutely exhausted.
It has been an incredibly long day for her. She did not sleep at all in
prison because because she was so worried about her boys.''
Father-in-law Mr Archie Whitehead, 75, said: ''She has not seen or
spoken to her husband since all this happened . . . The quicker we can
get him out the better.''

A MAN being sought by Scottish police in connection with terrorism
inquiries, was under arrest in Dublin last night.
Mr Adam Busby, alleged to have links with the outlawed Scottish
National Liberation Army, was taken into custody early yesterday.
The Gardai said they had arrested three men under Section 30 of
Ireland's Offences Against the State Act.
Mr Busby fled Scotland 12 years ago while on bail after being charged
with damaging a military vehicle. The Crown Office confirmed that a
warrant had been issued for his arrest.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night praised some ''key'' aspects of
Tory economic and industrial policy in a speech designed to reassure the
City that Labour had learned lessons from governments of both parties.
He ran the gauntlet of left-wing wrath, and Tory taunts, by
acknowledging that crucial elements of Tory legislation affecting trade
unions had been necessary, and would be retained.
''There is no point in arguing that everything about the British
economy is awful or that the Government has done everything wrong,'' he
said in a lecture to London's City University.
He went on to offer some praise for former Chancellor Nigel Lawson,
saying he had been ''right to stress'' the need to focus on the medium
term.
''Since Lawson left the stage, up until the last election, successive
Chancellors have continued to be dominated by short-term
considerations,'' he said. ''The post-war years are littered with
short-term economic decisions which, taken for initially quite sensible
and pragmatic reasons, have resulted cumulatively in a protracted period
of decline.''
Mr Blair said: ''There was undoubtedly a need to change the climate of
industrial relations. For example, the key elements of the 1980s
legislation affecting trade unions will be retained.''
He added, however, that despite areas of agreement, something had gone
very badly wrong with Lord Lawson's ''British Experiment''.
Reacting to Mr Blair's speech, the Prime Minister said: ''I'm
delighted to see that he's moving yet another of his policies in our
direction.''
He added: ''Whatever the Labour Party might say, I think you'd go a
very long march to find anyone who believes that they would have
sustained the counter-inflation policies that we've sustained
consistently for the last five years.''
He welcomed Labour's acknowledgement ''that we have been right for so
long and they have been wrong for so long.
''But if they were wrong in the past, why should anyone assume that
they will be right in carrying it out in the future? I don't believe
they will,'' he told a news conference to launch the second Tory White
Paper on competitiveness.
Mr Blair also used his speech to try to settle the taxation battle
with the Government with a declaration that economic performance decides
the level of tax, writes Geoffrey Parkhouse.
''A lower level of overall taxation is preferable to a higher level,''
he said, ''but the 1980s have shown that whatever the Government
intends, high taxation can be imposed on the economy as the penalty for
economic failure.''
He said: ''The boundaries for changes in both are much reduced. And
both are dependent on the performance of the economy, not on assumptions
about the desirability of particular levels of either.''
Setting out Labour's economic framework, he pointed to low inflation,
raising educational standards, and tackling long-term unemployment to
reduce spending on welfare.

A SCOTS woman was given life-saving surgery 30,000 ft in the air by
two doctors using a coathanger sterilised in brandy, sticky tape, and a
plastic bottle of mineral water.
Drama struck as Mrs Pauline Dixon, 39, from Torry, Aberdeen, suffered
a collapsed lung minutes into her flight from Hong Kong. As she
desperately struggled for breath, it became apparent the aircraft did
not have the medical equipment needed to carry out surgery.
Improvising with everyday items provided by the cabin crew,
Nottingham-based surgeon Professor Angus Wallace and Dr Tom Wong, a
senior houseman from Brechin, operated to provide a chest drain to
alleviate her condition.
They carried out the emergency surgery on Mrs Dixon in her seat in row
53, towards the back of the aircraft, after first screening off the area
from other passengers with blankets.
Passengers were asked to extinguish cigarettes as the pair cut a hole
in her chest using a scalpel and scissors from the plane's medical kit.
The doctors used a knife and fork to hold open the incision. Then they
tried to set up a drain using a urinary catheter -- but it was too
flexible.
Professor Wallace, an orthopaedic surgeon, found a coathanger,
sterilised it with brandy and inserted it into the tube to stiffen it.
To complete the operation, a bottle of mineral water was used as a seal
to stop air escaping. Minutes later, the lung pumped up and Mrs Dixon
was breathing normally.
Professor Wallace said: ''She was fully conscious thoughout but we
managed to find some drugs to double up as anaesthetics.
''I was sweating a bit to say the least and the first thing I did when
the job was done was drink the brandy. If she had known how much I was
worried she would probably have panicked more. It's the most unusual
operation I've ever taken part in.''
''The nearest airport was Delhi which was one hour away. I was not all
that keen on landing as I don't think she would have made it.''
Mrs Dixon said the operation was: ''The most frightening moment of my
life. The prof and the doctor said I would have to have an operation in
my seat or I would die. It was not a case of signing consent forms or
anything. I just told them 'do what you have to do'.''
She added: ''I'm eternally grateful to them both. Those two heroes
saved my life. They really excelled themselves considering the equipment
they had.''
Last night, Mrs Dixon, who had been returning from a 10-day break in
Hong King where she was visiting her sister, was recovering at Ashford
Hospital in West London where she was taken as soon as the aircraft
landed.
The mid-air emergency was caused by a motor-cycle crash in which she
had been involved on the way to the airport. She had walked away from
the accident and thought she was uninjured.
Last night, a British Airways spokesman praised the fast action of the
two doctors.
The drama began when Mrs Dixon complained of pains in her arm while
the Boeing 747, with more than 300 passengers aboard, was taxiing to
take off.
The cabin crew called for a doctor and the two medics came forward,
putting Mrs Dixon's arm in a splint.
But just 20 minutes later, with the plane already in the air and
beginning a 14-hour flight, she complained of chest pains. The pair
diagnosed that she had fractured ''between two and four ribs'' and that
her lung had collapsed. They then decided they would have to operate.
