BRITISH regions which are highly dependent on the hard-pressed defence industry
have won #84m of European aid, it was announced yesterday.
The Scottish Office has the list of areas north of the Border which will
benefit from the windfall.
Those eligible for grants include, Argyll and Bute, Cunninghame, Glasgow, parts
of Fife, and Edinburgh.
The grants will be used to help industry diversify and to strengthen the local
economic base.
The so-called Konver II programme targets small and medium-sized companies that
need help with innovation, know-how, and training.
Support will also be given to improvements to the environment, tourism
projects, and the restoration of military and defence industry sites.
Industry Energy Minister Tim Eggar welcomed the announcement as good news for
areas dependent on defence.
``These funds are particularly important in the drive to diversify and
strengthen the economic base of the areas concerned,'' he said.

SADLY, the real pantomime has been happening off stage here. A precipitate
parting of ways between the company and its artistic director - our news hounds
have been reporting on this - meant Borderline found themselves caught with
their panto down . . . and the curtain ready to go up. Ofpants, the official
panto watchdog, does not intend to comment on the background situation - which
seems as thorny as Carabosse's wicked wood - since his province is essentially
what appears before the public. So what did the checklist look like after an
afternoon with Babes in the Wood?
Definitely checkered. A rash of black spots, a bristle of question marks, and a
smattering of ticks, occasionally followed by the letters BTCOD. ``Beyond The
Call Of Duty,'' explained Ofpants tersely.
Most folk look and behave as if they'd accidentally tried on a costume and then
found themselves on stage, but Deborah Young and Jane McCarry actually manage
to make the sudden plunges into Scotch myths and music bearable, while Billy
Riddoch (BTCOD with !*) walked on at a few hours' notice and made Silly Billy
the absolute touchstone of merriment and warm humanity in a piece that
desperately needed both. The audience, mainly schoolchildren, were remarkably
amenable. ``I suppose it's better than doing quadratic equations,'' I
volunteered. ``Oh no it's not,'' said Ofpants, opening his Herald at the
Situations Vacant . . .

THREE workmen were killed when an explosion rocked an engineering yard on
Tyneside.
Four other workers were injured in the blast at the Howdon yard of engineering
firm Amec.
The firm is understood to make plant for the offshore oil industry, near the
northern end of the River Tyne tunnel.
The explosion is thought to have occurred during a pressure-testing operation
at the plant.
A spokeswoman for the Northumbria police said: ``Three persons have
subsequently died and the other four are being treated for minor injuries and
shock.
``No names are being released as we are informing relatives at the moment.''
An ambulance spokesman said the casualties were taken to North Tyneside general
hospital for treatment.
Nine fire appliances were called to the yard.
The explosion took place in a pressurised container at the oil rig construction
complex.
The cause of the explosion was not known but it was not thought to be
suspicious.
Factory inspectors have been notified.

TTHEY'RE all charming, not just the Prince. Andrew McKinnon has firmly opted
for traditional family fun in his theatre's version of the tale of the insipid
kitchen wench. Accordingly there's a welcome lack of the kind of smutty double
entendre which is increasingly plaguing some of the glossier productions.
As usual, the soppy stuff is boring but the comic turns are tremendous, with
fabulous performances from Ian Greive and John Ramage as the Ugly Sisters,
Bianca and Samantha. That EastEnders reference aside, there isn't a lot of
contemporaneous comedy, although a boisterous Gladiators-themed work-out class
from the aesthetically challenged siblings certainly got the audience roaring.
Young Philip Carroll and Lewis Christie provide further knock-about humour as
the double act Dun and Dee - together they're Dundee United, groan, groan.
They're more Tweedledee and Tweedledum than a Dumb and Dumber duo.
Paul Nivinson plays Buttons with winsome cuteness and the right smattering of
pathos, immediately winning our sympathies with the admission that when they
played doctors and nurses at school he was always the ambulance driver. With
credentials like that he'll clearly never get the girl.
All the panto staples are there, from fuzzy animals whizzing across the stage
to the skulking skeleton, the sing-along with actions, and the wedding finale.
The cast generate enough exuberance to ensure that everyone joins in - and the
only reason that this critic didn't participate in the ``wriggling song'' was
because of a phobia about a certain animal. That was the only alarming moment
in a fun-packed entertaining show which ably proved that sometimes old jokes
really are the best.

PUTTING the clocks forward by one hour permanently would have saved 110 lives
lost on the roads last year, according to new Government estimates.
A total of 2080 road casualties would have been avoided including 590 serious
injuries, say figures given by junior Transport Minister Steven     Norris.
The news was hailed by supporters of a Commons Bill to change the clocks and
intro- duce so-called ``double summer time''.
Campaigners for the idea say it would produce an extra usable hour in the
summer, cut road accidents and bring Britain into line with its European
partners.
Tory MP John Butterfill is to introduce his Private Member's British Time
(Extra Daylight) Bill to the Commons on January 19.
However, the Scots, who would be plunged into darkness for most of the morning
in the winter, oppose the scheme and it has been reported that the Cabinet has
decided not to support the back-bench measure. Mr Norris published the new
figures in a Commons written reply to Labour MP Keith Hill.
He said the estimates were produced by the Transport Research Laboratory and
were based on a test conducted in 1968-71 when summer time continued throughout
the year.
He said the figures covered the whole of Britain and could not show what might
happen in any particular region of the country where special circumstances may
exist.

Buga, Colombia, Thursday
AS many as 17 people, including a family of four, were rescued from the
wreckage of an American Airlines jet that crashed into a mountain in southwest
Colombia, Caracol radio said today.
It did not give an exact breakdown of the survivors amid the many conflicting
reports from the remote crash site in the guerrilla-infested region of Valle
del Cauca province. The aircraft was en route from Miami to Cali in Colombia.
In what one commentator described as a true ``Christmas miracle,'' Caracol
quoted hospital officials as saying the survivors included a husband and wife,
identified as Gonzalo and Nancy Dussan Delgado, and their two young children.
One of the survivors, 19-year-old student Mauricio Reyes, was rescued by his
older brother Juan Carlos, who rushed to the site on the slopes of the 12,000ft
San Jose mountain last night.
Overcome by emotion, Juan Carlos praised the Virgin Mary for what he told
reporters was a ``miracle.''
As rescue teams searched the remote mountainside crash site, emergency workers
said local residents who reached the wreck first had gone through luggage and
stripped valuables off corpses. Three looters were reported arrested.
Caracol said the survivors also included a girl about seven years old who had
been found trapped in the wreckage of the Boeing 757 jet.
A dense fog and driving rain forced the suspension of rescue operations late
this afternoon amid protests from grieving family members.
The accident was the most deadly involving a US carrier since the 1988 bombing
of PanAm flight 103 over Lockerbie that killed 270 people.
It was also the worst in Colombian history and took place within hours of the
December 21, 1988, anniversary of the Lockerbie crash.
Alvaro Cala, head of Colombia's Civil Aviation department, said he could not
rule out sabotage. He also stressed that aircraft navigation radio beacons in
the area had all been in good working order last night.
The plane was flying at 9000 ft when the crash occurred, Cala said, adding the
flight recorder had still not been located more than 15 hours after the
accident.
In Forth Worth, Texas, American Airlines chairman Robert Crandall told
reporters the crash site was ``somewhat to the east of the course line''
normally set for approaches to Cali, Colombia's third largest city about four
minutes flying time from the crash site.
The plane was carrying 156 passengers, including four infants, and a crew of
eight. It went down in an area dominated by leftist guerrillas, who have
targeted radio beacons for sabotage attacks in the past. The beacons, usually
located on towers or mountaintops, emit radio signals that help pilots map
their location.
Radio reports said at least 10 American citizens were believed to have been
aboard the fatal flight, including its pilot and co-pilot and Francisco Ferre,
a son of former Miami Mayor Mauricio Ferre.
Boeing officials in Seattle, who sent a team of investigators to Colombia, said
the crash was the first ever involving the twin-engine 757, which entered
commercial service in January 1983.
Just last month, the US Federal Aviation Authority downgraded its assessment of
Colombia's civil air authority to a conditional safety rating after it found
shortcomings in its international safety standards. -- Reuter.

THE leader of Scotland's biggest teachers' union, the EIS, has called for a
meeting with Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to discuss what he describes as
a growing crisis in education funding.
Mr Forsyth's announcement of a standstill education budget would only add to
the problems which were about to confront the new unitary authorities, said Mr
Ronnie Smith.
``There exists now an unprecedented threat to the level of educational
provision which com- munities in Scotland have come to expect and deserve,'' he
said.
Private Funding Initiatives for capital building programmes were an unknown
quantity for parents, pupils, students, and local authorities, which merited
proper funding, he continued.
Mr Smith contrasted the standstill budget with the recent announcement by
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke of additional resources.
Also, he criticised the planned expansion of the assisted places scheme for
private schools which could eventually cost #9m a year, on top of the existing
annual allocation of more than #10m.
He said it served to indicate ``that the Government priority is not one which
the overwhelming number of parents would endorse''.
In a letter to Mr Forsyth, Mr Smith wrote: ``I am sure that you will recognise
the urgency of the matter.'' That was why he wanted to discuss the impact of a
cut in real terms on schools, universities, and colleges, he said.

A COUPLE who were ordered to silence their noisy cockerels have won a partial
Christmas reprieve.
Ken and Julie Ayres were told by a court to get rid of three of their four
birds - and build an 8ft high fence around their farm-style property following
complaints from neighbours.
Dumbarton District Court JP Richard Dickson had originally insisted that the
Ayres comply with the demands before December 25.
However, he didn't realise that any fence over 6ft 6ins required special
planning permission from the local council.
Yesterday, he deferred the order for four months to give the Ayres until
mid-April next year to erect the enclosure - providing the council permission
is granted.
The Ayres have been told that their planning application must be lodged with
Dumbarton District Council by next Friday.
However, Mrs Ayres, of Strone House, Glen Fruin, Dunbartonshire, said: ``We are
supposed to include three builders' quotes for the work. We have written to
three but each one has been too busy to give us one.''
She added: ``The whole business with the fence is quite ludicrous anyway.
``How can a wire-mesh fence possibly affect the amount of noise which travels
through the air?''

OPPOSITION parties yesterday demanded that former Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
resign from his current Cabinet post after the Public Accounts Committee
published a scathing report on the handling of the Health Care International
private hospital project at Clydebank.
The committee found that #37m of public money had been spent in support of a
scheme where the company had gone into receivership just a few months after the
hospital was officially opened.
It added there had been insufficient evaluation of the major risks involved and
inadequate monitoring of the worsening financial problems; there had been an
outright loss of #8.4m to the taxpayer; and the hospital was still operating at
a level far below that originally envisaged.
The founders of the #180m hospital complex hoped it would attract several
thousand overseas patients a year and employ as many as 1800 staff. However,
the scheme had to be saved from collapse early this year when it was bought by
the Abu Dhabi Investment Company, a shareholder in the original project.
Both the Scottish Office Industry Department and the Scottish Enterprise agency
were severely criticised in yesterday's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report,
which stated: ``We consider that all concerned should have taken a tighter grip
on this project.''
Labour responded to the report by calling for the resignation of Mr Lang, now
President of the Board of Trade and Industry.
Scottish health spokesman John McAllion said: ``Ministers must not attempt to
hide behind criticisms of their departments or agencies. They are directly
accountable for the failings identified by the committee.
``Ian Lang was the Minister most closely identified with the HCI project. He
initially sought to take the credit for it and then tried to make excuses for
it when it went wrong.
``This damning report is a direct condemnation of his role as a Minister. He is
the Cabinet Minister now directly responsible for Regional Selective Assistance
which was so wantonly wasted on this project. He has to go, there is no other
honourable way out.''
The resignation call was echoed by the Scottish National Party, whose
parliamentary health spokesperson, Mrs Margaret Ewing, said: ``The Government
stands condemned of wasting vast sums of taxpayers' money on an unsustainable
and unwanted ideological experiment.
``Ministers allowed themselves to be blinded by their bankrupt ideology and
must face up to the consequences. As the Minister most closely associated with
the HCI fiasco, Ian Lang should now tender his resignation.
``If he does not, then it will simply confirm that the Tories are incapable of
governing in the public interest but are thirled to a narrow, and failed,
anti-Scottish agenda.''
For the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Robert Maclennan, a senior member of the
PAC, said: ``This costly episode was a triumph of dogmatism over prudence. The
Scottish Office threw millions of pounds of taxpayers' money at an unsound
private medical initiative. This is the kind of
Government enterprise Scotland can well do without.''
PAC chairman Robert Sheldon said there should have been much more thorough
market research internationally before the project went ahead on the scale
envisaged. He was also critical of the lack of adequate monitoring as the
hospital's financial problems worsened, adding: ``The board only met a few
times a year. With the level of crisis we saw, there was a case for meeting a
few times a week.''
Scottish Office Industry Minister George Kynoch said the PAC report made a
number of recommendations which the Government would review carefully ``to see
what lessons can be learned from this case''. The formal response would be
issued in due course in the form of a Treasury minute.
``However, this one project has to be viewed in the context of the Government's
policy of seeking to attract to the UK investment in a range of projects which
will broaden and strengthen our economic base, thereby creating and
safeguarding jobs.
``Clearly such a policy carries risks but these have to be considered as part
of its overall impact, which when viewed as a whole, is clearly very
successful.''
He added: ``The HCI story is of course not concluded, as the PAC report
acknowledges. The hospital remains in business, employing over 450 staff at
Clydebank, has benefited from major investment by its new operators, and
continues to pursue its target markets. Indeed, it only recently announced the
signing of a major contract for the treatment of Algerian patients.''
A Scottish Enterprise spokesman said yesterday that the agency was considering
the recommendations in the report and would advise the Scottish Office of its
response.
Clydebank and Milngavie Labour MP Tony Worthington said: ``The report makes it
clear that the Government did no work of its own to evaluate the market. It
simply took the word of others who were seeking public money. The PAC said
there should have been a tighter grip. That is putting it mildly. There was no
grip at all.''
Public service union Unison said the report vindicated all the union's earlier
warnings about the HCI project.
Mr John Lambie, the union's Scottish head of health, said: ``What is especially
galling is that the really guilty men - Malcolm Rifkind and Ian Lang (both
former Scottish Secretaries) - have been rewarded with promotion to national
level, and Michael Forsyth, who was Scottish Minister for Health at the time,
is now Scottish Secretary.''
He added that the HCI hospital was now competing with NHS hospitals for NHS
contracts. The management at the HCI hospital refused to make any comment on
the report on the grounds that it related to management prior to receivership.
A company spokesman said the hospital's new owner, the Abu Dhabi Investment
Company, was happy with the current situation.

<TEXT>
IN the worst disaster on the accident-prone Egyptian railways for more than 15
years, 75 people were killed and 76 injured today when a crowded train ran into
the back of another in thick fog.
Eyewitnesses in the town of Badrasheen, 17 miles south of the capital Cairo,
said an early-morning train taking about 120 workers south to the town of Beni
Suef rammed a train to Assiut city from behind at high speed.
One carriage rode up on top of the others and two derailed, one of them onto
wooden stalls by the side of the track.
The driver of the second train, Mahmoud Ali, said the first train should not
have been there and he saw no red signal as he came to the last level crossing
before the crash.
Ali has had his right leg amputated from the knee down in Badrasheen hospital
and could hardly speak.
``I saw fog all around,'' he mumbled. ``I am not meant to stop at this place. I
was astounded by what happened.''
Another survivor, Mohamed Zaki Abdallah, ended up crushed under three other men
in one of the derailed carriages. He was badly bruised, scratched and bloodied.
Sobhi Abdelbaqi, a heavy plant operator who saw the crash and took part in the
rescue operations, said he had tried to pull two dead people out from under the
Beni Suef train.
``There was a man hugging his daughter - a girl about nine years old. We got
the girl, except for one of her legs, but the man is still there,'' he said.
``There are still lots of people under the cloth shops that were destroyed. We
pulled out two dead women from there. And there was this one man stuck up on
the carriage there and we cut his legs off and pulled him down.
``The crash squeezed bodies into the wood of the shops so we had to cut them
away,'' he added.
Hassan Nigm, the local police chief, told Reuters the latest death toll was 75
dead and 76 injured. The figure could rise when rescue workers lift the
derailed carriages.
Abdelfattah Abu Zeid, a municipal worker, said he had counted 50 corpses going
to Badrasheen central hospital. His colleague, Fathi Wahdan, counted 65 going
to Hawamdia hospital.
But the Interior Ministry in Cairo said its latest casualty toll was 60 killed
and 150 injured.
Police said the first train, the one travelling to Assiut city, had about 220
people aboard. The trains should have been about five minutes apart but the
Assiut train had slowed down because of the fog, police Colonel Mohamed Ibrahim
said.
Residents said the stretch of track around Badrasheen was notoriously
dangerous, with 43 people killed in a head-on collision near the local station
in 1992 and 18 killed in 1993 at a collision two stations away.
The disaster reinforces the poor safety record of the Egyptian railway and
level crossing systems.-Reuter.

RADIO One DJ Chris Evans appeared to forget all about his early morning show
yesterday. He failed to turn up the day after his Christmas party.
In fact, apart from one woman, all his breakfast show team failed to arrive at
Radio One. A stand-in DJ was called in at the last minute after frantic
attempts to reach the station's highest-paid performer failed.
Radio One said their star DJ was ``unwell due to a throat infection''.
However, the station said later that Evans, who has a #1m contract, was facing
a showdown with station controller Matthew Bannister for missing his show.
Spokeswoman Polly Ravenscroft said: `I am sure he will be reprimanded. He has
been burning the candle at both ends for some time now. He has been getting up
at 4.30am and going to bed late. He obviously went out and had a good time at
his Christmas party.''
A spokeswoman for Evans said: ``Chris took everybody from the programme out for
Christmas lunch and it developed into a bit of a session. He'll get a ticking
off when he's located but he's not answering his phone.
``How many people go to office parties at this time of year and don't make it
to work the next day? Chris will be back tomorrow and will probably explain
everything on the programme.''
The only member of his team to arrive, a woman called Holly, turned up at the
studio at 8.45am, 15 minutes before the programme was due to end. She told
listeners: ``I really can't remember too much at all about last night.''
Another one of his team revealed that, after the breakfast show on Wednesday,
the DJ went shopping and bought Christmas presents for all his production
staff. He added: ``When he came back mid-morning the drinking started pretty
much immediately. Then everyone went for lunch at a restaurant at the Hilton
Hotel on Park Lane. After lunch, which was a pretty raucous affair, Chris went
awol.
"He has not been seen since. He phoned in to Radio One this morning and said he
had a throat infection. However, it has not gone down well with BBC bosses,
some of whom managed to get in with sore heads from their own Christmas
parties.''
A Radio One spokeswoman said: ``Chris will be getting a ticking off when he
comes back.''
Since joining the station, Evans has annoyed BBC chiefs by flying the flag of
his company, Ginger, from radio masts at Broadcasting House, and he was
reprimanded for ``smut'' after listeners' complaints. BBC governors also
censured him for urging listeners to boycott Shell petrol stations during the
Brent Spar controversy, and the Broadcasting Standards Authority accused him of
overstepping the boundaries of acceptable taste.
However, the carrot-haired DJ has boosted Radio One's audience by more than
600,000 since he was brought in to reverse a slump in listening frigures.

BAD news for Eve: a new report disputes the theory that one genetic mother of
us all lived 200,000 years ago in Africa, arguing that there had to be some
100,000 ``Eves'' existing much earlier in time.
The report in tomorrow's edition of the journal Science that our earliest
genetic forbears existed perhaps 60 million years ago, long before human beings
walked the earth, contradicts the ``mitochondrial Eve'' theory advanced eight
years ago.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley said then that all
people descended from one African woman, basing their finding on tracking of
mutations in an original molecule of DNA, the genetic blueprint contained in
every living thing.
In every DNA molecule, there are some 6 billion bits of information. Most of
these bits are in the molecule's heart, or nucleus, but about 15,000 of them
are outside the nucleus, in an area called the mitochondrion. This
mitochondrial DNA is passed only from mothers to children, and the Berkeley
team used this to find the woman they say gave all current humans this part of
her DNA, which mutated down through the ages.
They theorised that she lived 100,000 to 200,000 years ago and while she was
not the only woman to have children then, her genes were the only ones that
endured to the present day.
But Francisco Ayala, a professor of biological sciences at the University of
California at Irvine, used mathematical models to argue that this could not
have happened.
``I find the ancestral molecule for an important piece of DNA that deals with
the immune system,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``That molecule existed
60 million years ago, about when the dinosaurs became extinct, before the
origination of modern monkeys, let alone humans.''
Ayala, the author of the study being published in Science, calculated that for
all the variants of this immune system gene to have survived until now would
have required a population of at least 100,000.
Some scientists say the one true Eve was possible because at times of great
anatomical change there is a population bottleneck - fewer people. But Ayala
said through all the big anatomical changes, from the time of the earliest
monkeys until now, ``there were no population bottlenecks at any time of our
ancestral species.''
The theory of mitochondrial Eve has sometimes been used to argue that the
differentiation between races was rather recent in evolutionary terms, but
Ayala disputed this notion, saying this differentiation was more likely to have
occurred around 1.8 million years ago when early humans began leaving Africa
for Europe and Asia.
And what about Adam? Scientists reported in the British scientific journal
Nature this month that ``Y-chromosome Adam probably lived 188,000 years ago.
The Y-chromosome is passed only from fathers to children, just as mitochondrial
DNA is passed only from mothers.-Reuter.

GENEVA: Eighteen remaining members of a doomsday sect at the centre of a mass
suicide-murder last year have gone missing, police said yesterday. Police in
Switzerland, France and Canada are involved in the hunt for the members of the
Order of the Solar Temple, so far without success, said Geneva police spokesman
Alexandre Baeriswyl.
Fifty-three members of the sect were found dead in Switzerland and Canada in
October 1994. Leading members committed suicide while the others were murdered,
investigations found. The reasons for the tragedy were never uncovered.
Nazi claim
VIENNA: Austrian public prosecutors said yesterday they were investigating the
possibility of criminal charges against far-right Freedom Party leader Joerg
Haider after an amateur video showed him making a speech praising the Nazi SS.
The video of Haider addressing and mingling with a group of former SS officers
in September has sent shockwaves through Austrian politics and society since it
was screened on television on Tuesday.
Smoking ban
BEIJING: A public smoking ban was ordered yesterday in Beijing, capital of the
world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco. The standing committee of the
People's Congress passed the no-smoking law, which will go into effect next
May. Violators will be fined 10 yuan (80p). China has over 350 million smokers
among its 1.2 billion population. In Beijing, more than 50% of the population
smokes.
Santa protest
STOCKHOLM: A man chosen to portray Father Christmas on a Swedish televsion show
has been exposed as a convicted child molester, sparking a storm of protest. A
pay channel TV Christmas gala will feature Hans Scheike, sentenced to six
years' imprisonment in 1988 for grievous bodily harm and sexual assault
involving children. Scheike led a notorious sex sect in which young teenagers
were held as sex slaves.
Election joy
PORT LOUIS: Mauritians celebrated yesterday when Prime Minister Sir Anerood
Jugnauth, 65, lost his parliamentary seat in an opposition rout of the ruling
coalition. The results were sweet revenge for Navin Ramgoolam after his father,
Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, was beaten in 1982 following 14 years of rule.

Holiday tragedy
MADRID: A French lorry driver failed a breathalyser test yesterday after his
truck collided head-on with a van, killing eight Portuguese emigrant workers on
their way home for Christmas. Four others in the van were gravely injured. The
32-year-old trucker was nearly twice over the limit after the crash near
Vitoria in northern Spain, police said.
Stalin honoured
MOSCOW: Scattered groups of Russian Stalinists braved a snowstorm in Red Square
to place flowers on their hero's grave yesterday, the 116th anniversary of his
birth. A small group of mostly elderly members of the hardline All-Union
Communist Party (Bolshevik), who boycotted last Sunday's parliamentary
election, laid a wreath and flowers on the grave in Red Square.

Washington, Thursday
SCIENTISTS have discovered a spectacular fossil of a 9ft ostrich-like dinosaur
squatting over a nest filled with eggs. The finding suggests birds inherited
their behaviour from dinosaurs.
The creature, its long arms wrapped around the nest, may have been engulfed by
a giant sandstorm 80 million years ago in Mongolia's Gobi Desert.
Dinosaur experts were astounded by the finding.
David Weishampel of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said
scientists did not know that dinosaurs brooded their nests.
The fossil itself is an ``amazingly beautiful'' freeze-frame image of the
dinosaur, he said. ``Without any imagination at all you can imagine this
critter sitting on a nest.''
Jack Horner, curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman,
Montana, said he considers it ``one of the two best specimens of dinosaur
fossils ever found.''
``We've had nests and babies and all sorts of things, but we had never had the
direct evidence of the parent with the eggs,'' he said. ``By far this is the
strongest evidence of some kind of parental attention.''
The find is reported in tomorrow's issue of the journal Nature.
The dinosaur, called an oviraptor, looked like a wingless ostrich with a
shorter neck and a long tail.
The scientists found the fossil in 1993. The dinosaur skeleton and the nest
were removed in a single 400lb block of sandstone to show how they were found,
because ``otherwise people would not believe us,'' said Mark Norell, associate
curator of vertebrate paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History.
The oviraptor is ``in the exact same position as if you looked at a chicken
sitting on a nest,'' he said.
He and colleagues uncovered 15 oviraptor eggs in the nest and concluded that it
probably contains about 22, a typical number. The eggs are neatly laid out in a
circle, the thinner ends pointing to the outside.
Norell said researchers assume the eggs all belong to the oviraptor found on
the nest, although he noted that ostriches have communal nests in which mothers
deposit their eggs.
It is not known whether the oviraptor was male or female, Norell said. The
skeleton includes most of the torso, including much of the pelvis and ribs, and
both arms and legs.
Scientists also do not know whether the creature was keeping the eggs warm as
birds do, or whether it was shading them or protecting them. ``We don't really
know whether this thing was warm-blooded or not,'' Norell said.
Although birds had appeared by the time the oviraptor died, the finding
provides the strongest evidence yet that birds inherited brooding from
dinosaurs.
That is because birds and oviraptors evolved from a common dinosaur ancestor,
Norell said. And since the brooding behaviour is found in oviraptors and the
birds, it was probably present in that common ancestor, he said.-AP.

ALL Glaswegians may have a sombrero or a straw donkey tucked away in the
wardrobe from that holiday on the Costas but it seems such connections are not
enough for the city to twin with the Spanish resort of Benidorm.
The twinning was proposed last month by the Mayor of Benidorm, Mr Vicente
Perez-Devesa, at a private meeting with Glasgow Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall.
Mr Perez-Devesa was in the city on the first leg of a glad-handing visit round
the UK to bang the drum for what is already Spain's number one holiday
destination.
However, Glasgow will not be joining in the chorus of Viva Espana. Council
leader Pat Lally has written to the Spaniards to tell them the idea is a
non-starter.
Mr Lally fully agrees in a letter to the Spaniards ``that Benidorm is a city in
which many Glaswegians enjoy wonderful holidays. I am sure that the obvious
friendship that exists between the people of Glasgow and Benidorm, and which
was clearly cemented by the Lord Provost and the mayor, can be maintained
without any formal links.''
However, he adds: ``It is council policy to limit the number of our twinning
relationships and to focus on developing links with cities which offer the
opportunity to develop substantial trading and economic links as well as
friendship and cultural links.
``Glasgow is twinned with Nuremberg in Germany, Dalian in China, and
Rostov-on-Don in Russia, while our agreed priority is to explore the
possibility of establishing links with a city in North America and Japan.''
Mr Lally goes on to say that with local government reorganisation in the wings
it would be inappropriate for the council to commit its successor to a new
twinning relationship.
Unofficially, The Herald also understands that twinning with Benidorm would put
councillors at a disadvantage because any time they jetted off to the town they
would leave themselves open to the allegation that they had gone off on a
``freebie''.
When it was first mooted that he should meet the Lord Provost, Mr Perez-Devesa
was told that a full diary precluded such an encounter. However, a meeting
subsequently scheduled at the City Chambers for 15 minutes ran over to 90 and
saw the Lord Provost tie a tartan tie round the mayor's neck.
The Lord Provost said yesterday: ``The idea of twinning was never a goer. It
never got off the ground. I was being polite with the mayor as I would be with
anyone who came to my home.''
Despite the setback - which will leave Benidorm with three twins, Bad Ems in
Germany, Vina del Mar in Chile, and Le Cannet in France - the town is confident
it will maintain its market share and attract about 100,000 visitors from
Scotland despite the fact that the industry is predicting that next year will
be difficult.
Last night, Mr Perez-Devesa said: ``Although obviously disappointed that
Glasgow is not able to take the twinning idea further I'm delighted to continue
to welcome Glaswegians to Benidorm.''
To maintain its number one position, the resort has spent more than #20m
improving facilities and upgrading hotels rather than allowing new ones to be
built. With the completion of the 52-storey Hotel Bali in 1997 (which will
become Spain's tallest building) no new hotels are being built.

RAILTRACK'S investment plans for the next 10 years exclude the long-awaited
electrification of three major lines in Scotland, including the busiest
commuter route, Glasgow-Edinburgh.
The ``upgrading freeze'' was condemned last night by Labour's transport
spokesman Brian Wilson as an appalling step backwards.
He added that Railtrack's failure to mention nine major electrification schemes
throughout the UK in investment plans over a decade will be greeted with fury
and dismay in the areas ``which have been written off''.
Mr Wilson said of Labour's analysis of Railtrack's #1000m-a-year investment
programme, published earlier this week: ``It represents no more than a wish
list, dependent on taxpayers' money - and they do not even wish to include the
extension of electrification over a full decade.''
However, Railtrack insisted the #10bn programme was not prescriptive. A
spokesman argued it covered schemes to be completed within the decade. ``In no
sense does it exclude any other developments. It does not mean other projects
have been thrown out. It is possible the Scottish electrification schemes could
start within the next 10 years.''
Mr Wilson said later: ``Oh, come on. They are not included in the programme
because they are not to be.''
Excluded from the programme are Glasgow-Edinburgh;
Edinburgh-Glasgow-Stirling-Dunblane-Perth, and Edinburgh-Dundee-Aberdeen.
All have been the subject of strong, sustained campaigns for upgrading, with
the latter the only non-electrified section of the East Coast main line to
London.
Save Our Railway campaigners believe money spent on the privatisation process
should go to upgradings and electrifications. However, some experts believe
electrification of the Edinburgh-Glasgow line, estimated at #89m, would not be
cost effective, with travel time benefits negligible.
Aberdeen-Glasgow electrification could cost #400m.
q Rail services will run down on Christmas Eve, with no trains on Christmas Day
and limited services on Boxing Day, ScotRail said last night.

Big Country have a lot to live up to at Edinburgh's Hogmanay bash. But, as
Stuart Adamson tells David Belcher, the size of the date isn't everything
I'm not keen on being seen as a rock'n'roll soap-box evangelist
STUART Adamson's 1995 has been a year of contrasts. During its course there
have been some very big Big Country gigs, and some rather more intimate ones,
too. Being a down-to-earth Dunfermline laddie, of course, Stuart keeps it all
in perspective.
Having earlier this year, for instance, supported such rock behemoths as the
Rolling Stones and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, Stuart and his cohorts will not
be rattled next weekend by playing al fresco before 100,000-plus revellers at
the grand civic bash which is Edinburgh's Hogmanay on an all-tartan bill beside
Edwyn Collins, Aly Bain, and the Scottish Fiddle Orchestra.
Big gigs, small gigs: Big Country do their bit. On the same day that Big
Country skirled on Hampden's turf alongside 130 pipers as part of the pre-match
warm-up for the Dundee-Aberdeen Coca Cola Cup final, they helped Glasgow's Lord
Provost switch on the city's Christmas lights in George Square.
Shortly afterwards, the band were interfacing with politicians in less amicable
style: handing over an anti-nuclear-testing petition on the steps of the French
consulate in Edinburgh, their current single, Nosn (Stop The Tests), having
been designed to act as a consciousness-raiser for Greenpeace's Pacific protest
campaign.
And just one week after that, Stuart and his long-time Big Country guitar-foil,
Bruce Watson, were playing as a douce acoustic duo, the Neverly Brothers, in
the venerable environs of Dunfermline abbey's abbot's house in a fund-raiser
for the local council's heritage scheme.
Naturally, when we meet, Stuart is fulfilling yet another role: laughing-eyed
mine host of Tappie Toories, his recently-acquired, tastefully-renovated,
eighteenth-century pub in Dunfermline's city centre. No, that's wrong.
Actually, what Stuart is doing when we meet is expertly wiring up the payphone
on Tappie Toories' bar and joking couthily amid a platoon of dust-covered
workies. ``My overalls are upstairs, stained and grubby,'' Stuart says with
lantern-jawed pride, his eyes crinkling into their trademark smiley crinkle.
His chest swelling, Stuart points to a gleaming stained-glass sign on display
in the pub's window. Stemming from the pub's previous 100-year lifespan as the
Star Tavern, the sign was rescued by Stuart and his wife, Sandra, from stoorie
oblivion. But what are tappie toories?
Tappie toories: old Scots for high spires, fittingly enough for a pub located
on Dunfermline's heritage trail midway between its city chambers and the abbey.
Like Stuart Adamson, if it's not too fanciful to say it: aiming star-wards, but
rooted in Fife.
``I hate to come out with the old `keeping-my-feet-on-the-ground' phrase, but
that's it really. I love being a songwriter, but in order to write about
people, you need to be among them. I enjoy being among the people I grew up
with.
``In the same way, I'm not keen on being seen as a rock'n'roll
soapbox-evangelist. It's more to do with having been on tour in Europe through
the summer and having seen everyone protesting about the French nuclear tests.
``But back in Britain, nothing - maybe because John Major's got his hand in
French pockets. So the single was intended to alleviate my frustrations and
give Greenpeace some support.''
Pop and politics: one can easily scupper the other. Speaking of which, I'll
never forget accompanying Big Country to Moscow in 1988 on a hugely-expensive
48-hour publicity stunt intended to promote the band's then-current Peace In
Our Time album by linking it to the emergent Soviet-dismantling process of
glasnost.
A plane-load of hacks, radio DJs, media-drunks, PR toadies, magazine weasels,
and rockbiz dimwits flew over for a less-than-triumphant gig, disrupted by
mysterious power-failures, in a municipal sports hall. Final result? Big
Country appearing the victims of their own rock-star hubris, entangled in
events beyond their control - and minus some of the expensive stage-gear that
they'd brought into the Soviet Union.
``I went in with my eyes open, and it was the best and worst experience of my
life,'' says Stuart. ``You hear about these legendary music industry disasters
from the seventies, and it was great to be on the end of one of a real one.''
Best bits?
``Doing the Soviet Union's first non-Government-run gig for which people simply
turned up at kiosks and bought tickets, and where the first 10 rows weren't
Government friends and relations.''
Worst bits?
``In the West, we'd been told for years how grim life in the Soviet Union was,
and as with all propaganda, there's an element of truth. I saw the queues for
food. You felt people's suspicion . . . suspicion of us, of each other . . .
everyone was so guarded.
``I think I learnt that if you take peoples' ambition away, you take people's
fire away. And that extremes of anything never work.''
Paradoxically, in the seven years since the extremes of that Iron Curtain trip,
Big Country's career seems not to have reached the commercial heights it did
previously. How true were tabloid horror stories about the Moscow lig-of-ligs
having incurred large-scale financial losses?
``There are newspaper stories and there are newspaper stories,'' Stuart says.
``It wasn't commercially great, but what mattered was that the whole thing was
a blast! It's not about taking the money and scuttling off to stuff it under
your pillow.''
It is true, though, that Big Country have been laying low for the past couple
of years, not least because Stuart and his family spent 18 months in their
Florida des res. From there, in a detached way, Stuart could observe the
vagaries of British pop fashion.
``In the US you hear lots of guitar music on the radio, the new punky stuff.
Not so much Green Day - too cartoonish - but Offspring, Cracker, the Flaming
Lips.
``But our singles don't get daytime radio air-play in Britain. It's especially
annoying when your record reaches the UK top 40 and you're told that you're not
getting play-listed on Radio 1 because no-one wants to hear it.
``Then again, unlike a lot of current British chart pop, Big Country's music
has an expressive, ethnic, Scottish and Irish folk base with a different tonal
nature and a different set of values... after all, Scottish folk is the roots
of country and western. There aren't the same obvious connections with English
bands.
``I mean, you can trace the current Britpop thing back in an obvious chain from
Blur to the Sex Pistols, to the Kinks; from the sixties to the fifties, to
Tommy Steele, to the forties, to music hall.''
Not that you'll find Stuart Adamson going mindlessly nationalistic and uttering
disapproving cries of Jings and Crivvens in the face of Blur's gorblimey
trahzers. He has too well-developed a sense of humour for that.

A DOCTOR who was infected with hepatitis B is said to have recovered and
returned to work in the Ayrshire and Arran area.
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board stressed that there was no risk of patients
being infected by the GP.
However, a Labour MP is to ask the health board what is being done to tackle
similar incidents in the future. Two years ago, a Staffordshire doctor was
diagnosed as having hepatitis B after working in Ayrshire and Arran and the MP
also wants confirmation that the cases are not linked.
Public health consultant Dr Cameron Stark said blood tests on the un-named
doctor in the latest case showed that he or she was clear of infection.
Dr Stark said: ``We would like to stress that there was absolutely no risk to
patients because the GP was not involved in invasive work.''
Dr Stark added that any infected patients would have come to light by now and
there were no plans to name the doctor or issue a warning to patients.
Meanwhile, Cunninghame South MP Brian Donohoe said yesterday: ``I will be
contacting the health board for assurances that the health of local patients
has not been put at risk.''

<HEADLINE>Warning to the terrorists over killings as Dublin delays release of IRA prisoners Ulster peace impetus renewed</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister and his Irish counterpart, Mr John Bruton, gave renewed
impetus to the peace process at a summit meeting in Dublin last night, but
there was a warning later for the men of violence.
The Irish Government dropped a plan for the pre-Christmas early release of IRA
prisoners, a move understood to be related to this week's Belfast murders of
two men in shootings linked to the IRA by some Northern Ireland security
sources.
Up to 10 men had been expected to be set free permanently as part of Dublin's
continuing response to the Northern Ireland peace process. One of the group was
thought to be Thomas McMahon, who has served 16 years for the 1979 IRA murder
of Lord Mountbatten and three other people in a fishing boat explosion.
At a joint news conference after the summit, Mr Major insisted he was not at
odds with the Irish government on the desirability of an elected assembly for
Northern Ireland.
Mr Major also insisted that the Irish government was committed to finding a
formula for the decommissioning of terrorist weapons as a prelude to the
holding of all-party talks.
In a similarly positive vein, Mr Bruton said that they were both very pleased
with the speed and the application of the international body in proceeding with
its task on the arms issue.
Mr Bruton said the two leaders believed that everyone engaged in the political
side of the ``twin-track process'' was showing a commitment to making it work.
Both leaders were determined to prolong ``the feel-good factor'' engendered by
US President Bill Clinton's visit, and to play down reports of differences
between London and Dublin on the details of the arms issue and the Ulster
Unionist proposal for an assembly in Belfast.
Placing strong emphasis on the importance of the assembly as a catalyst for the
political talks, Mr Major said that Irish government criticisms related to
details about its functions - and ``not as a forum from which negotiators might
emerge''.
The Prime Minister said that the assembly proposal had to be examined by all
parties.
``People who do not examine it would perhaps be closing off an option for
proceeding that an increasing number of people find to be attractive.''
Mr Major said he recognised that the whole assembly could not negotiate a
political settlement. But after the election of such an assembly representing
all strands of political opinion in Northern Ireland, ``other options may be
delivered''.
Mr Major said he very much hoped that this would be the case.
Asked if these options might include an electoral college from within the
assembly or a mandated smaller negotiating group, he said this would spring
from the will of the assembly.
Equally emphatic on the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, Mr Major said
that the key point for both governments was that without decommissioning it
would be difficult to see how the objective of getting all the parties around
the negotiating table could succeed.
The two Premiers called on the murder gangs in Northern Ireland to stop their
``appalling barbarities'', in a condemnation of the Belfast killings.
Earlier, in Northern Ireland, Mr Major told the IRA and Sinn Fein to stop
trying to maintain the laughable fiction that they were two separate
organisations.
He condemned the recent killings in Belfast and said that if the speculation
about their responsibility was correct, ``is that not the clearest indication
of why it is necessary for all weapons to be decommissioned?
Mr Major, who visited Ballymena, County Antrim, Belfast, and Downpatrick,
County Down, said it was not just the Government that wanted the guns
decommissioned but the vast majority of the people of Ireland, north and south.
In a direct message he said: ``If those talking about peace for 18 months or so
are genuine in what they say, then they can prove that very clearly, by proving
that they really wish to take the gun out of politics, by doing it - I hope
they will.''
The summit was given the go-ahead 24 hours earlier after the settlement of an
unrelated dispute between the British and Irish governments.
The dispute centred on Britain's opposition to a European Union plan to aid the
takeover by an Indian buyer of the troubled, state-backed Irish Steel company
because of fears it could have consequences for the UK steel industry.
It was felt the row might sour UK-Irish relations to an extent that the summit
would be counter-productive. But the differences were overcome after telephone
contact between the two Premiers on Wednesday - and their meeting plan was
confirmed.
Mr Major will return to London today after staying overnight at the British
Ambassador's residence in the outskirts of the city.

A YOUNG woman was followed near where murdered Kilmarnock schoolgirl Mhairi
Julyan was last seen alive, police revealed yesterday.
The woman, who is in her twenties, was tracked on London Road, Kilmarnock. The
incident happened in darkness on Wednesday last week, just three days before
16-year-old Mhairi's killing.
It also emerged yesterday that a mystery caller who phoned police could have
vital information.
The man leading the murder hunt, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder, said:
``A woman was walking in London Road at about 5.30pm last Wednesday when she
realised she was being followed.
``That's obviously of interest to us and we are anxious to hear from anyone who
had a similar experience in that area, or who has any information.''
The man, who is thought to be 5ft 2in tall, was in his early twenties with dark
brown, collar-length wavy hair, light stubble, and a sallow expression. He was
wearing a brown leather jacket.
No words were spoken and the man disappeared after the woman, who police are
not identifying, turned off London Road.
DCI Lauder also revealed that a witness had phoned police with information
about a sighting of Mhairi walking in London Road shortly before 10pm on
Saturday. He urged the person to call again.

Good response to
police appeal
WITNESSES to the road accident which killed a Glasgow woman and her unborn
child have been traced by police. Mrs Helen Howe, 32, of Bilsland Drive,
Ruchill, was a passenger in a car which crashed head-on into another vehicle on
Blackhill Road, Summerston, Glasgow, on Tuesday.
Mrs Howe died from multiple injuries, the almost full-term baby was still-born.
Police said last night that two women who passed the accident scene in a Ford
Fiesta had contacted them following a media appeal. Two teenagers from the
other crash car have been traced but a third occupant has not been found.
No-one has been charged.
Open all hours
A LOCH Lomond tourist centre on the A82 - gateway to the Highlands - which
served 69,000 visitors in its first year, will open year round, it was
announced yesterday.
Hospital review
LOTHIAN Health has asked West Lothian NHS Trust to carry out a feasibility
study on the future care of elderly people at Tippethill Hospital in Whitburn.
Proposals include refurbishment of the hospital or the building of a
purpose-built unit.
Impostors chased
TWO bogus workmen were chased from a doorstep by an 86-year-old woman waving a
walking stick, police revealed yesterday. The two posing as water board
officials tried to gain entry to her house in Killin Street, Glasgow, on
Wednesday. One of the men is about 20years old, 5ft 7in, and was wearing dark
blue overalls. The other man is between 25 and 32, of broad build, and was
wearing dark clothing.
Guppy loses
OLD Etonian Darius Guppy, the disgraced friend of Earl Spencer, lost his bid to
overturn a three-year sentence imposed for non-payment of a #227,000
compensation order at the High Court yesterday. He was given a five-year prison
sentence for falsely claiming insurance on jewellery ``stolen'' in New York.
Youth custody
A TEENAGER who helped stab the husband of Director of Public Prosecutions
Barbara Mills during an attempted robbery, was given six years' youth custody
at Inner London Crown Court yesterday. Bernard Enerio, 17, was convicted
earlier this month of unlawfully wounding and robbing Mr Mills, while acting
with others unknown, for supplying a Ninja knife used in the attack.

yesterday for separate offences involving guns. William Freeman, 34, of Duke
Street, Dennistoun, Glasgow, admitted threatening a kebab shop owner with a
plastic gun. William Wilson, 36, of no fixed address, admitted tying up staff
of a music shop in the city's St Vincent Street and robbing them at gunpoint of
#750. Robert McDade, 31, of Millerfield Place, Dalmarnock, Glasgow, robbed a
bookmakers of #1600 at gunpoint.

Navy clears
Solway bombs
MORE than 200 bombs were cleared from a Solway beaches during a month-long
operation by a naval disposal team.
The 10lb Second World War devices were uncovered by tides at Southerness beach
but are not thought to be linked to phosphorous incendiary bombs washed up on
the west coast during gasline work near Beaufort's Dyke - the sight of a
wartime arms dump. Further searches will take place in the new year.
Man in custody
A MAN is in police custody in connection with an early morning incident after
which an elderly woman was taken to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. The incident

Gloucester dig
CROMWELL Street pathologist Professor Bernard Knight, who examined 12 victims
in the West case, was helping police exhume the body of Ukrainian Iwan
Romanowskyj in Gloucester's Coney Hill cemetery yesterday. The professor was
called in after police took a 36-year-old man into custody and charged him with
murder. An inquest had returned an open verdict on Mr Romanowskyj, who died of
stab wounds in October 1985.
Missing woman
POLICE are searching for a 31-year-old woman who has been missing since
December 13. Ms Jennifer Bain was last seen at her home in Brechin, Angus, as

GRAMPIAN Healthcare revealed yesterday that its partners in the bid to win the
contract to run hospital services in Grampian will include an English-based
company which runs private nursing homes around the UK.
There is thought to be significant interest in the contract.
The Government caused controversy earlier this year when it rejected Grampian
Health Board's proposal, reached after wide consultation, that Woodcot Hospital
in Stonehaven should be disposed of and a new hospital built on the site of
Arduthie Hospital.
The Scottish Office NHS Management Executive told the board to invite open
competition and while some welcome the move as an opportunity for Stonehaven to
gain a hospital service tailored to the needs of the community others see it as
a major step towards privatisation of the NHS.
Grampian Healthcare is determined to win the contract and is heading a
consortium which includes CHS (Community Health Services), which runs a number
of private nursing homes, Miller Construction of Scotland, and the British
Linen Bank, which will finance the project.
``The trust is satisfied that a partnership arrangement will enhance our
prospects of winning the contract because the bid will have to meet the
criteria of the Government's private finance initiative,'' said Mr Jack Stuart,
who heads the trust's project team.
``All these companies have expertise in one form or another in the health
provision and with their support I am sure we can put together a body which has
a realistic chance of winning.''
The details of the project have still to be fully developed but the proposal
will include the construction of a hospital and 30-bed nursing home complex on
the Arduthie site.
The NHS services would continue to be under the control of Grampian Healthcare
while the nursing home would be the responsibility of CHS.
Expressions of interest were due to be submitted by 5pm last night. Details are
expected to be given this afternoon and a small number of providers will be
short listed in January.
Tenders will have to be returned by April 16 and the contract is expected to be
awarded in May with the new hospital operational a year later.
Grampian Healthcare staff and trade unions were being briefed on the plan
yesterday..
Mr Ken Macmillan, Grampian officer for the health service union Unison, said:
``Right now the trust is the body being led and it will continue to be led by
these private organisations who are only there for the cash. The trust is
merely the straw available to them to suck the public pot dry.
``Banks are not renowned for foregoing their pound of flesh and construction
companies' expertise in health-care provision is more than questionable.''

THE ailing official from Ofpants, the panto watchdog, had seconded his deputy,
a junior clerk from a local government quango who didn't know much about it but
knew what he liked, to monitor possible seasonal entertainment violations in
Inverness.
At the interval he was looking concerned. ``I know the audience is in full
voice,'' he said, pointing to his standard issue rule book, ``but it's
infringing the As-Seen-On-TV regulations.''
Indeed, the more amateurish moments in this traditional production are thanks
not to the show's well-drilled amateurs, but to the curious mix-and-match
casting that lands a Scottish Dame (Jackie Farrell) with one Australian son
(Matthew Lilley of Home and Away), and one southern English son (Sacha Pitimson
from The Biz). The anomalies wouldn't matter if these actors demonstrated a
feel for the subtleties of the broad art of panto, but they seem to think it
enough to jump around a lot and flap their arms at the audience. It isn't.
To be fair, they're not helped by a script that lacks flair - it tells the
story cleanly enough but many of the gags fall flat and the characterisation
isn't strong enough to support it. Several sequences ramble so much it's as if
they've been improvised.
Director Sheridan Nicol's strength is in her choreography - which is, after
all, what she is known for - and the dance sequences look far more polished
than the story proper. The music too is strong (director, Irvin Duguid) and
unsentimental even in the romantic numbers.
The man from Ofpants draws my attention to the fulsome yell of approval from
the matinee audience, and we grumble off into the winter dusk.

THE East Lothian school of painting, centred on East Linton, flourished
throughout the nineteenth century, attracting those interested in landscape and
those inspired by the new realism - the art of the French Barbizon painters and
of the realist Bastien Lepage, who also influenced the early work of the
Glasgow Boys. For a brief time they themselves set up temporary lodgings at
nearby Cockburnspath and explored peasant painting, earning the nickname of the
Cabbage School.
Interestingly, the exhibition does not consider the Glasgow Boys' work but
concentrates instead on East Linton painters such as Robert Noble and Darling
MacKay. Noble's lush oils are an evocation of the time and full of the richness
and colour of the land; but they are also, it has to be said, rather
sentimental. Even Darling MacKay's pieces, which sometimes have the sincerity
of a Bastien Lepage, don't have his bite. There is no sense of social comment
or even historical description in these paintings - they are objective and
self-conscious, waiting to be enjoyed for their own sake.
There are touches of brilliance by acknowledged masters: a wonderful study of
dusk in East Linton by James Paterson, a startling early John Bellany, Preston
Tower, a blackness against a yellow sky, and Arthur Melville's Cabbage Garden,
setting the ground at an inspired angle and heavy with the influence of
Japanese art; but these artists were not members of the school.
The exhibition organisers should be congratulated on publicising this
long-neglected school, but the show lacks cohesiveness; the accompanying text,
which outlines changes in farming methods and life, doesn't balance with the
romantic, almost idyllic, paintings. In the end we get only a glimpse which
doesn't do the Scottish Barbizon painters justice.

A YEAR after being treated successfully for breast cancer at Glasgow's Western
Infirmary, Miss Eleanor Martin is going back as director of nursing.
Her remarkable career move follows a 33-year association with the city's Royal
Hospital for Sick Children, where today is her last day as director of nursing
and patient services for Yorkhill NHS Trust.
The equivalent post in the West Glasgow Hospitals Trust covers the Beatson
Oncology Centre where Miss Martin, 55, was a patient last year.
``I am absolutely fine now. I was very lucky - I was caught very early on as a
result of screening,'' she said yesterday.
``The fact I had come through this alive made me think that maybe it was time
for a new direction.''
After her first stint at Yorkhill, starting from nursing school in 1962, Miss
Martin went to the Stoke Mandeville Hospital. Since returning to Yorkhill, she
has worked in neonatal surgery and obtained a Master of Business Administration
degree at Strathclyde University.
``It will be hard to walk out of here tomorrow,'' she said. ``I will really
miss the children but I am looking forward to the fresh challenge.''

LABOUR yesterday attacked employers who fail to give more than two million of
the workforce paid time off at Christmas.
Employment spokesman Ian McCartney said: ``It is a disgrace that many families
will be unable to spend Christmas together simply because their breadwinner is
not entitled to paid time off.''
He added: ``Tory Scrooge employment policies have created a country where two
million people cannot even get a paid day off for Christmas. These figures
should make Ministers choke on their turkey with shame.''
Labour findings, based on Government figures, show that 10.6% of all employees
have no entitlement, including 3.8% of all full-timers. The proportion of male
part-timers with no paid holiday is, at 54.6%, almost double that of women,
28.1%.
Mr McCartney said such people were forced to work not just anti-social hours
but on holidays as well, simply to make ends meet. The best Christmas present
for many of them would be the introduction of minimum standards of protection
at work.
Shadow Employment Secretary Michael Meacher had more gloomy news for unemployed
people. He said more than half (52%) of the vacancies registered with job
centres are now for part-time or temporary work.
He said that even when an unemployed person found a job, the odds were against
it being a regular full-time one. ``Without a major programme to end job
insecurity, Britain will be stuck in economic gloom throughout the new year,''
he said.

THE heaviest snow falls in the Shetland Islands for 15 years led police there
to appeal to all motorists not to drive unless their journeys were essential.
Snowploughs guided ambulances through the worst of the drifts and tonnes of
snow cleared from the centre of Lerwick had to be dumped in the town's harbour,
creating a mini iceberg.
Elsewhere, the first snow of the winter in the South-west caused traffic
problems on the main A75 Euro-route between Stranraer and Gretna for much of
yesterday and there was a spate of accidents along the road with several people
slightly injured.
Several inches of snow fell on higher areas of the region and conditions on
most roads were reported as extremely dangerous for several hours.
Strathclyde Police said only good fortune prevented a multi-vehicle accident on
the M8 in the Glasgow area yesterday afternoon when many drivers apparently
ignored the adverse weather conditions.
In the Highlands, all 300 snowploughs and gritters took to the roads last night
and kept most routes open. The Benefits Agency announced cold weather payments
were being sent out to several hundred people living in the Aviemore, Braemar,
and Tulloch Bridge area.

THE operators of the controversial Skye bridge yesterday unwrapped the present
they will give the people of the island on Christmas Day, 24 hours toll-free .
. . which seems to have left many decidedly underwhelmed.
Mr Russell Thomson, the bridge manager, said yesterday: ``This is the first
time that it has been possible to make the crossing as the ferry did not
operate on Christmas Day. We are delighted therefore to be able to offer our
customers a toll-free day with our best wishes for the season.''
Skye Bridge Ltd director Bob Wilson, meanwhile, said: ``In view of the
encouraging use of the bridge, we have managed to secure a concession from our
financiers to allow the bridge operators Miller/Dywidag to make the bridge
toll-free from midnight on Christmas Eve to midnight on Christmas Day.''
Some, however, seemed to sense humbug. Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the
Skye Bridge Appeal Group said: ``It is not even being mentioned, so I think it
is fair to say the people here are not particularly impressed by this
announcement today.
``What is of greater interest is that they admit they have had to go to their
financiers, the Bank of America, to ask permission to make this gesture. It is
the Bank of America which calls ths shots even down to holiday arrangements.''
Tolls for the Tay, Erskine, and Forth road bridges will remain in force over
Christmas and New Year.

MOTORISTS who ignored hazardous road conditions and warnings to drive carefully
after heavy snow showers in some parts of Scotland were accused of
``disgraceful'' driving by the police yesterday.
Strathclyde Police said only good fortune prevented a multi-vehicle accident on
the M8 in the Glasgow area yesterday afternoon.
Some motorists were reported to have been driving ``erratically'' by weaving in
and out of the traffic, while others failed to keep a safe distance between
their vehicles and those ahead.
Superintendent Fred McManus, of Strathclyde Police's traffic department, said
last night: ``Regrettably, it is all too common an experience that, when
adverse weather conditions prevail, drivers do not adapt their driving
accordingly.''
Strathclyde Police said that, although road conditions were very poor in the
Newton Mearns area in the south of Glasgow, Kilmarnock, and the A77 at
Eaglesham Moor, there were no serious road accidents.
Snow and ice also played havoc with air services in the east of Scotland last
night. Aberdeen was not badly affected but Edinburgh airport had to shut for
more than an hour, having previously taken diverted flights from Glasgow.

SNP leaders yesterday challenged Labour councillors to follow their lead in
giving special help to pensioners to combat the problem of keeping warm during
the winter months.
They claimed the fuel poverty amid energy plenty which existed in Scotland -
affecting 800,000 households - was ``a scandal of immense proportions''.
At a press conference in Edinburgh, the SNP vice-convener for local government,
Councillor Maureen Watt, said her party had a record second to none in
providing practical assistance over heating costs.
Councils controlled by the nationalists had developed a range of packages worth
#1.4m to help people, particularly the elderly, get through the cold winter
months safely and in comfort.
As an example, she displayed some of the hundreds of letters the party says it
has received from 19,000 pensioners in West Lothian who are each getting a #30
bonus from the district council.
West Lothian Councillor John Richardson said: ``The SNP have been inundated
with letters of support from pensioners who are grateful for the help which the
council has been able to provide. The #30 payment which we make represents
three week's fuel costs for pensioners, which means that West Lothian's elderly
are better able to fend off winter's chill.''
It is believed that regional councils are not legally allowed to give such
one-off payments and the position of the new unitary councils on the issue is
still uncertain.
However, Councillor Watt said the three new SNP-run councils of Angus, Perth
and Kinross, and Moray were determined to continue to give special help in some
form to the elderly during the winter.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night ordered the scrapping of a Labour Party
Christmas card which contained an illustration of a condom and a topless woman
saying ``Spank me''.
The Labour leader said the card showed a lapse in good taste.
He has told party officials, and Labour's ad agency which designed it, that
nothing similar should happen again.
The card was intended to poke fun at various Conservative scandals, and
contained a spoof version of the Twelve Days of Christmas.
To illustrate the scandals, the card, unveiled at a Labour function at
Westminster, showed a bra, underwear, a whip, and hotel bills as well as the
condom and the naked woman.
Ms Tessa Jowell, Labour's women's spokesperson, said: ``It was a parody on the
12 days of Christmas.''
The card was designed by Labour's advertising agency, BMP.
A spokesman for Mr Blair's office said: ``This was meant to be a light-hearted
Christmas joke.
``The script of the card was agreed and cleared but the illustrations on the
card were not.
``Mr Blair has been shown the material and believed it showed a lapse in good
taste. He does not want this card to be used in any way by the party, and the
agency and party officials have been instructed that nothing similar should
happen again.''

POLISH Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy today denied in parliament accusations by
the interior minister that he had been a long-term informer for foreign
intelligence services.
``I was never anyone's agent,'' Oleksy, formerly a senior figure in Poland's
pre-1989 communist system, told a special session to hear details of reports by
President Lech Walesa of a threat to state security.
He admitted he had known Russian and Soviet diplomats but said he had severed
ties with one when he learned he was a KGB agent. Asked by journalists later
whether he thought he should resign, Oleksy replied: ``I don't.''
The prime minister was responding to a statement by Interior Minister Andrzej
Milczanowski which accused him of acting as an intelligence informer until
recently.
``In 1995 intelligence was obtained indicating Mr Jozef Oleksy as an informer
of foreign intelligence,'' Milczanowski told parliament.
He did not name the foreign country but from Oleksy's denial it was clear the
issue concerned Moscow.
``Information emerges that in 1990-95 Mr Jozef Oleksy had many meetings with
officers of foreign intelligence during which he knowingly conveyed
information, some of which was classified,'' Milczanowski said.
He said Polish security knew that even in the 1980s foreign agents had a spy
among Poland's then-ruling communist party, but his identity had only emerged
this year, after Oleksy became prime minister in March.
Milczanowski rejected Oleksy's claim that he had severed links with people he
had been warned were foreign spies.
Oleksy said he had numbered Russian and Soviet diplomats among his close
contacts.
``The moment that the head of (Polish security) informed me that one of these
acquaintances was a KGB officer.......I stopped all contacts with him,'' Oleksy
said.
Russia's intelligence service yesterday denied that Oleksy has co-operated with
it and denounced the charges as a political provocation launched before Walesa
yields the presidency to ex-communist Aleksander Kwasniewski on Saturday.
Walesa, defeated by Oleksy's close colleague Kwasniewski in presidential
elections last month, claims there is a threat to state security.
The prosecutors office is due to decide tomorrow whether to proceed with a
formal inquiry into Oleksy.-Reuter.

A WOMAN has beaten the odds to become a mother for the first time, after seven
Christmases of despair.
Six of Angela Dickson's babies died before birth, two of them from cardiac
failure in the womb and the others early in pregnancy.
Now she and husband, George, are in seventh heaven after getting their best
Christmas present yet.
Mrs Dickson, 29, cuddled daughter Taylor and said: ``She's just perfect. I
could not ask for more. It is what we have dreamed of after almost eight years
of pregnancies.''
Ten weeks after Taylor arrived at the couple's home in Glasgow, Mrs Dickson
still wakes in the morning and finds it hard to believe that she is a mother.
It is all George, 27, can do to tear himself away from her cot to go to his job
as a mechanic. Even being wakened through the night is no chore.
Mrs Dickson said: ``When people, who did not know us well, asked if we were
going to start a family, I would just smile and tell them `some day'.
``Inside, my heart was breaking because I thought that we just were not
destined to become parents. Getting pregnant was not a problem. Keeping the
babies till they were ready to come into the world seemed impossible.''
Doctors could offer no medical explanation as to why her babies died before
birth.
``They carried out a myriad tests but there was no obvious answer,'' said Mrs
Dickson.
The obstetric team at Glasgow Royal Maternity explored every avenue of
treatment and by the last pregnancy Mrs Dickson was on a combined course of
folic acid to reduce the chance of foetal handicap, hormone treatment to lessen
miscarriage, and aspirin to make sure that the blood supply to the baby through
the placenta was not interrupted by blood clots.
She was also monitored by weekly scans. Both Mr and Mrs Dickson were on a
course of multi-vitamin tablets.
Baby Taylor was looked after in pregnancy and delivered by Dr Alan Mathers,
foetal medicine specialist at Glasgow Royal Maternity.
Dr Mathers described the unsuccessful pregnancies as ones which beat medical
science.
``We carried out every available investigation but they failed to provide an
answer to the cause.
``However, we were delighted to help Mrs Dickson achieve a healthy baby against
tremendous odds.
``These are the patients which make you realise the immense joy attached to
obstetrics.''
Mrs Dickson said: ``What Dr Mathers did was give us a healthy baby and we owe
him a great debt.
``He also gave me the encouragement and confidence to keep trying. Believe me,
I despaired of it ever happening.
``However, when I told him we were determined to have a baby he assured me they
would offer all maternity care and support possible.''
Mrs Dickson described how she is still adjusting to motherhood. ``I have yet to
accept that this has really happened. I keep thinking that I am looking after
someone else's baby and that it's all too good to be true.
``If I have to go into the kitchen, I keep checking the living-room to make
sure Taylor is still there. I realise those feelings will settle with time.
``George is so delighted that he's reluctant to leave her and go to work in the
morning and when he returns home he goes straight to the cot.''
Although she is just 10 weeks old, the infant is alert and frequently wide
awake. ``Taylor does not want to go to sleep at night but that is partly
because she is getting so much attention from our families,'' Mrs Dickson said.
``And to be honest I don't really care whether she keeps us up at night because
she is just such a joy to have around.''

A SHERIFF has called for a review of medical procedures involving junior
doctors after a man was twice misdiagnosed and died of a perforated ulcer.
The sheriff urged that junior doctors should be given better training to rule
out further ``possible errors of judgment''.
Mr Billy Muir, 51, who had a history of stomach ulcer complaints, was detained
for observation at Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, after complaining of
vomiting blood. He was discharged by doctors who said there was no cause for
concern.
Mr Muir, of Ben Lui Drive, Hawkhead, Paisley, returned to the hospital the
following day with severe stomach pains but, after being kept in for two hours,
was diagnosed by a junior doctor as having a blocked bowel, given suppositories
and sent home.
He died on February 20 - a day later - from peritonitis caused by a perforated
duodenal ulcer.
A pathologist who carried out a post-mortem examination told a fatal accident
inquiry at Paisley Sheriff Court earlier this year that Mr Muir's ulcer had
burst two to three days before he died.
The junior doctor who discharged him had worked in the casualty unit of the RAH
for just over two weeks after spending six months in the accident and emergency
unit at Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow.
Sheriff Neil Douglas, delivering his written judgment on Mr Muir's death
yesterday, urged that inexperienced young doctors should refer similar cases to
more experienced colleagues.
He said trainees had little chance of identifying vital warning signs because
advances in medical science had resulted in serious stomach complaints -
including perforated ulcers - becoming rarer.
Mr Muir's mother Mary, 75, told the inquiry she believed medical staff had been
negligent and that her son might still be alive if he had received proper
attention.
Dr Joris Van Der Horst, a senior house officer at the RAH, examined Mr Muir
when he was admitted to the ward from casualty. He said he had not been in pain
or showing any signs which would have alarmed him.
However, he conceded that he may have been more concerned, or at least
suspected the patient's condition had deteriorated, if he had made the same
observations made later by a colleague.
Consultant surgeon John Anderson of Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, said Mr
Muir might not have died if he had had been admitted to hospital after his
second visit and kept under observation.
He said a more experienced doctor might have admitted him and added: ``That is
one of the classic errors of judgment that junior doctors can make.''
A statement issued yesterday by the RAH said: ``We will be studying the report
and cannot comment until we have had the opportunity to do so.''

PERTH City Hall, one of the fixtures and fittings of Scottish political life,
may be demolished to make way for a piazza and a three-storey shopping mall
centred around a ``Golden Tower'' tourism attraction.
Perth and Kinross District Council has a plan to obliterate the B-listed hall
where Ted Heath made his famous declaration of Perth in 1968, promising
devolution for the Scots; and where Margaret Thatcher made her post-election
pledge of a war on ``Marxism''.
The council's #25m ``Putting a New Heart in Perth'' initiative envisages a
large piazza-style open space leading up to a redeveloped Kirkgate Centre
hosting quality shops. A new conference hall would be constructed at Horse
Cross and linked to the city's existing museum and art gallery.
But the normally douce citizens of the tweedy county town are up in arms over
the plan to tear down the hall and replace it with a new civic square. Two
thousand people have signed a petition and opponents accuse council planners of
destroying the city's heritage.
Opened in 1911 and constructed at a cost of #30,000, Perth City Hall was to
``remain for centuries'', according to the then Lord Provost.
Yet, if all goes to plan, the Edwardian neo-baroque hall by noted architect
Henry Clifford will have survived less than 100 years.
With the Scottish Conservatives already having turned their backs on what was a
traditional venue for their annual gathering, council officials insist the hall
is not suitable for the needs of the modern conference market.
THE council also estimates that #1m would have to be spent on essential repairs
to its interior over the next few years, while any major refurbishment would
cost between #3m and #7m.
But the proposals for a radically altered city centre have gone too far for
some of the inhabitants of Scotland's ancient capital.
Mr Dennis Gray, who runs a city-centre kilt shop, is one of the most vociferous
opponents. ``We don't want a piazza, we want to keep our city hall.
``They will replace it with seats, flowers, and winos and all I could say to my
grandchildren will be `that's where our city hall used to be'.
``The main thing is Perth's heritage. Once it's knocked down the hall cannot be
rebuilt again.
``In my opinion the money would be better spent on flood protection measures to
help the people of Perth. If you were to walk through Perth today I think you
would struggle to find people in favour of the plan.
``The city hall should be saved - that's what the majority of people want. It
is too important a part of our heritage to destroy.''
Perth Provost Jean McCormack is backing the demolition plan. ``The city hall
was always regarded by Margaret Thatcher as one of her favourite venues but
John Major has voted it down during my term of office.
``I have had the benefit of the presentations on the new scheme and I am very
much sold on the idea. There is a lot of sentiment attached to the city hall
and it is a radical suggestion to knock the hall down. But we have to move with
the times and the hall is just not suitable for modern political conferences.
``Perth lacks a city square and knocking down the hall would give us a
good-sized square and open up a vista on the beautiful St John's Kirk.''
Proposals will go before the district council early next year and the plans
would also have to be considered by the new unitary Perthshire and Kinross
Council.
The plans have already received the blessing of at least one of the city's
blue-blooded citizens.
Lord Perth, president of Perth Civic Trust, but speaking in a personal
capacity, said: ``I think it is a most imaginative and exciting thing. To open
up the whole of the square where the city hall currently stands would create a
tremendously interesting open space.
``Although I can understand the sentiment about not taking down the existing
city hall, I think it is in every way right.
``Perth would benefit enormously from it and it takes the city into the
twenty-first century.''

IT IS a miserable scene played out with increasing frequency during these
Christmas shopping weeks. Dawn Fulton arrives at the austere perspex window of
the car pound off the High Street in Glasgow to negotiate the return of her
Mini Metro. It was uplifted from Midland Street 20 minutes before. The signs
displaying credit cards accepted for the #105 charge are an added irony. If
Dawn held a credit card she would not be in this predicament.
Her costly ten-minute illegal parking manoeuvre, on a single yellow line, was
to allow her to withdraw a special #250 grant. Dawn, a final year student
taking a primary education degree to qualify next year as a teacher, had been
awarded the money by the Child Care Fund of Strathclyde University's student
association. A single parent, the grant was to allow her to give her children
Barry, 10, and Nikki, 9, a decent Christmas.
Her plan was to collect the money and return to East Kilbride to shop for toys
and food. The risk she took, parking close by the bank, halved that Christmas
cheer. An unanticipated queue at the bank was all it needed. By the time she
got back to her vehicle it had gone. The privately contracted hoisters had
responded to a police request to remove it. The operation was as speedy as it
was sickening. It left Dawn facing the #105 charge, which she paid with money
literally marked for her children, and the #20 fixed penalty parking ticket. A
double bind.
Dawn can hardly hold back the tears. Her predicament is desolate enough, but
snow begins to fall towards the ugly iron gates of the pound, and it gives an
added pathos. ``There was no notice,'' she says. ``I thought a single yellow
line just meant limited parking time. The car wasn't causing any obstruction,
causing a risk of an accident or an emergency.'' She looks bewildered, and
fights conflicting feelings of foolishness and anger. The level of the charge
has clearly shocked her. She never fully understood the risk she was taking.
``I am being penalised at the same rate as an executive in some large company
who can put this down on their expenses,'' she blurts finally, seizing on the
significance of the credit card display. ``I would like to know who is
benefitting from this? The police are a public service, but a private
contractor making a profit out of this is a disgrace.''
The name of Bells of Richmond appears on the six hoisters, vehicles with their
apparatus that look strangely like instruments of medieval torture, as they
hunt their prey through the city centre streets. The contract is due for
renewal next year. Bells have operated for the first three years of the scheme,
raking in #486,000, the successful tender accepted by Strathclyde Regional
Council over eight rival firms. Bells are experienced hands in this ugly game.
They also contract in London and Edinburgh.
Unlucky drivers are refused a company telephone number, and are given only a
London post office box address if they have complaints. This is to discourage
``cranks'' and ``angry people'', it is explained politely. Indeed, no number
for a Bells of Richmond is listed. The company actually operates as Whitrad
Ltd, Middlesex. They are unlikely to ever feature in a Beatles song, unlike
Lovely Rita the meter maid, who had some compensating presence. The
contractors, in their quasi-uniformed navy pullovers with emblems on the chest,
act defensively. They refused to be interviewed.
The company's successful tender represents some 30% of every vehicle lifted.
Since 1993 more than 16,000 vehicles have suffered the ignomony. It has raised
#1.7 million credited against the police budget within the overall Strathclyde
Regional Council budget. The cost of the service is assessed annually net of
income. The increased activity of the Contractual Removal of Vehicles, as it is
somberly termed, has provoked the AA and RAC to talk about a ``purge'' and to
raise questions of a ``revenue-raising exercise''.
``Not at all,'' denies Chief Inspector Jim Neill, of Strathclyde Police's
traffic department. ``Of course the contractors have to make a profit to
survive. But the charge is set by Government, nationally across the board. Any
private enterprise - if they don't make a profit they don't survive, and we
wouldn't have any contracters available, capable of paying their employees and
updating their vehicle fleet.
``This whole scheme is not about making money, nor is it about numbers of
vehicles. We are not interested one iota. Bells of Richmond are not either. The
whole ethos and thrust is road safety.''
NEITHER does Mr Neill accept that the scheme operates in an apparently
arbitrary fashion, singling out particular streets for intensive activity, on a
basis that appears to maximise numbers of cars to be swiftly removed rather
than over-riding traffic-flow criteria. Midland, Howard, and Shuttle Streets
are perceived as current targets, precisely because they are convenient.
``That's not true at all,'' counters Mr Neill. ``It's about regulation. It's
about people who will park illegally and by doing so avoid the cost of parking
and ignoring traffic regulation orders. A minority of the motoring public are
absolutely selfish and bloody minded. They are dogmatic and want to drive from
door to door, regardless of the inconvenience they cause. Some do it selfishly.
Some do it with a lack of thought.''
A quota system is denied. ``The quota we would like to achieve is no vehicles
removed at all,'' says Mr Neill. Even so, since 1993 the removal rate has been
steady from Glasgow city centre, with a slight increase that appears to deny
the success of the scheme and which runs counter to the expectations of
regional councillors when it was adopted. The figures are: 5123 cars (1993),
5416 (1994) and 5048 so far this year, with a final figure of 5600 anticipated.
In Edinburgh, 10,185 cars have been lifted already this year, according to
Lothian and Borders Police. The daily rate there is currently running at 25
vehicles.
Despite the deep unpopularity of the scheme among victims, Mr Neill insists
that it has been applauded by taxi associations, passenger transport
associations and bus companies who have appreciated the ease on congestion. He
claims people in bus queues have stood cheering as a vehicle is removed because
it was causing a safety hazard. He also maintains that it is a discretionary
system, willing to recognise cases where disabled drivers have been unfairly
penalised, where errors have been made, and where penalties have been applied
outwith restriction times. After ``sympathetic consideration'' full fees have
been refunded. He cannot give numbers.
It is useless to suggest anything of this to Dawn Fulton as she reflects on her
children's money she has just had to hand over. As she speaks, we are joined by
another woman who has had her battered X-registration Ford Sierra impounded.
Barbara Orton, an independent television producer, is furious. This is the
second time she has had to retrieve her vehicle in a fortnight. ``It is
completely arbitrary,'' she insists. ``That's what infuriates me. On the way
over here I have seen literally hundreds of illegally parked cars. This is what
I get for parking on a single, innocuous yellow line.''

CEILIDHS have been increasing in popularity throughout the nineties. Most of us
have done a bit of birling and twirling, even if it's taken some coaxing to get
those tapping toes on to the dance floor. It's good-natured. It's Scottish.
Anyone can do it.
But next time the band strikes up at a party or a wedding, why lumber bemusedly
like a buffalo playing tig, when, with a wee bit of practice, you could get the
steps right? There are experts who can help anyone who wants to make a New
Year's resolution to add finesse to enthusiasm.
Freeland Barbour and Karin Ingram have been sharing their expertise and
enthusiasm with a growing number of regulars and newcomers at Glasgow's
Riverside Club where the ceilidh revival really got going and where people
still pack the floor on Saturday nights.
Monday evening is when dancers of all ages and proficiency gather. Freeland
plays the accordion. Karen calls out the steps. They banter, they cajole, they
encourage. This is hands (and feet) on learning. It's fun. The only difference
between the Monday ``class'' and the weekend ceilidh, is that everybody knows
(or is taught) what they're doing. It's dancing by numbers.
You advance, you retire, set, cast off, visit your corner, learn what to do
with ``man one'' and ``lady four'' and because everyone is there to dance, you
don't have to sit around looking cool and detached. Being a wallflower isn't an
option.
``This is social dance rather than country dancing,'' says Freeland Barbour.
``Country dancing is courtly dancing. It's a bit more intricate and formal.
This is basically `round the room dancing.' Anyone can get up there and do it.''
It's not every box player however who can play sympathetically for dancing and
Freeland's skill and tact in matters of rhythm and tempo add enormously to the
pleasure of the experience. A founder member of Silly Wizard, an innovative and
influential music producer at BBC Radio Scotland in the eighties and mainstay
of the Wallachmor Ceilidh Band, Barbour, a Blair Atholl man originally, is also
one of Scotland's leading composers. He even wrote the theme tune for The
Beechgrove Garden. Music takes him all over the world but the Monday sessions
are a fixture. He sees them as a means of preserving and promoting the
tradition he is steeped in.
Karin Ingram does the calling with Freeland's other band The Occasionals and is
dance artist in residence for Dumfries and Galloway. Her instructions are a
model of witty lucidity.
We tend to think of calling as a North American feature at square and barn
dances. But as Freeland points out, there have always been callers in British
dance too. ``I was impressed by what some of the English callers were doing and
people like Bob Blair of Stramash began trying out these techniques up here.
It's not at all instructive. It helps things flow. A good caller adds to the
enjoyment of the dance.''
As class clod, I was taken graciously in hand by several energetically
accomplished regulars, most of whom have been going along for years, polishing
up the familiar dances and learning new ones.
The selection of dances is beautifully paced and varied. Houlihan's Jig was
like sumo wrestling on speed. Finding the direct ``corner '' in the Lancers was
trying to cross a motorway at rush hour. This was not Karin's fault. Once again
more experienced people kept me right with good humour and good grace.
I'm a pretty diffident chap and was at ease and on my feet within minutes. Most
of those attending came along in pairs or as part of larger groups. Dances call
for couples, fours, sixes and eights, so it's possible to stick with one's
friends and meet new people at the same time. Women dance cheerfully with each
other. You do what you like. Most people come here often: so you don't need to
ask.
The class starts again on January 15. At Easter, Freeland and Karin are
organising a residential course on Skye. There, as at the Riverside Club,
beginners are welcome.

WOMEN are set to become common currency in Scotland under a proposal to put
them on banknotes being considered by the Clydesdale Bank.
It would be the first time that a woman's face has been imprinted on currency
notes in Scotland. The representation of women on English notes is only
slightly better. The Queen and ``The lady of the lamp'' Florence Nightingale
gaze out from notes issued by the Bank of England.
The plan is to restrict the nominations to prominent historical figures to
avoid any unseemly controversy that could develop if past and present political
figures were suggested. ``We would definitely prefer a historical Scottish
character,'' said a Clydesdale Bank spokesman who added that no final decision
had been taken.
Suggestions already received by the bank include Elsie Inglis who set up
hospital units staffed by Scottish women in Serbia during the First World War,
after being told that the Government was not interested in the services of
women. A maternity hospital in Edinburgh named after her is no longer open.
Another suggestion is Flora Stevenson who was the first woman to sit on a
school board in Scotland. She was also involved in the women's suffrage
movement, and a school in Edinburgh was named after her.
The Herald asked contemporary Scotswomen to name who they would like to see on
a note. Ms Ray Michie, the Liberal Democrat MP, voted for Jenny Geddes who
tumbled into the history books when she threw a church stool at an English
minister.
``I think it's a great idea, but I would prefer someone other than Mary Queen
of Scots or St Margaret. We have not been able to look after our own affairs
for such a long time that not many women have come to the forefront,'' Michie
said.
Ms Annabel Goldie, vice-chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, found it
difficult to name a famous Scotswoman in history. She said she could not even
remember the men on banknotes and could only recall Edinburgh Castle in the
background.
Goldie finally settled for Eve. ``I would like Eve on a banknote. I would like
her with a fig leaf. Eve has a lot to answer for. She would be an instructive
example. Her face on a banknote would draw me up short and make me reflect on
what I was doing. In this cynical age we are so busy spending the money that we
don't pause to think who is on the notes,'' Goldie said.
SNP MP Margaret Ewing wondered how appropriate the plan was with a single
European currency looming, but added: ``I would like the picture of an old lady
who is not named. It could be everybody's mother or grandmother.''
Despite her initial hesitation she supported the idea as it would reflect
women's contribution to society. She felt Mary Queen of Scots would draw
substantial romantic interest from tourists. Her other nomination went to one
of Robert Burns's loves, Jean Armour, as 1996 is the Burns bicentenary year.
Labour MP Helen Liddell proposed Marion Gilchrist for leading the way for women
into medicine. Gilchrist was the first woman to graduate with a medical degree
from Glasgow University in the late nineteenth century.
Ms Elspeth King, the author of The Thenew Factor on forgotten women in
Scotland's past, believed that throughout history women's contribution had been
underplayed.
She suggested St Margaret of Scotland; Isabel Elder, who founded the Elder
Library in Glasgow, for the impetus she gave to the education of women; Flora
Drummond for her involvement in the women's suffrage movement; and writer
Catherine Carswell, whose books include a biography of Robert Burns.
In countries around the world the preference seems to be for symbolic female
figures in traditional costume as on French, Russian, Greek, African, and Irish
notes.
Israel is one of the rare countries that placed its former Prime Minister,
Golda Meyer, on banknotes. The current series of Chinese currency features
women representing different ethnic groups.
The Queen no longer figures on notes of Commonwealth countries such as
Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, but still appears on the currency of the
Cayman Islands and Bermuda.
The reaction of most Scottish women was that the move in this country was long
overdue. They believe it should be the start of more concrete steps to uncover
inspiring stories of Scottish women buried in the cobwebs of the past.
Once a decision is taken on who will be the first Scotswoman to grace a
banknote, it may well become as commonplace to have Scotswomen looking out
disapprovingly from banknotes at spendthrifts as the traditional Scottish male
icons.

JENNIFER CUNNINGHAM investigates the rights and wrongs of refunds on unwanted
gifts
ONE of the saddest sights of the season of goodwill is the queue of people
trying to exchange or refund the jumpers or shirts, presumably painstakingly
chosen by their nearest and dearest.
So what do you do if Auntie Jeannie is convinced you are two sizes smaller than
you are or vice versa ? If you are the giver rather than the receiver, the
advice of consumer officers is to patronise the patron saint of exchanges, keep
the receipt or even better, if you know it is equally likely to be a hit or a
miss, ask the shop to write on to the receipt that this article may be
exchanged if not suitable.
Only if the goods are faulty, can you count on your money back, however. Even
Marks and &amp; Spencer who used to trade on a promise of refunding unsuitable
goods, now offer gift vouchers to spend in the store if there is no receipt. It
is a fair exchange for genuine customers while putting a spanner in the
shoplifters' latest dodge of stealing from one branch and claiming the refund
in another.
Few people, however, give presents with the receipt attached. Alan Adams,
Strathclyde's principal consumer officer, suggests including the receipt in a
sealed envelope to be opened only if the present is unsuitable. He claims to
have used this device himself, but admits to a suspicion that the recipient
sneaked a look.
There is a clear obligation on the part of the seller to give back cash, if the
goods are faulty rather than unsuitable. It may be less than the full amount
depending on how old the article is and how much use has been made of it. The
amended Sale of Goods Act came into force last January as a clarification of
grey areas of consumer law, it removed the phrase ``of merchantable quality'' -
key to thousands of legal wranglings in favour fulfilling the purpose for which
it was bought. It also requires the retailer to offer a cash refund instead of
a replacement, repair or credit note.
That knowledge is likely to be of more use to bargain-hunters in the January
sales than to churlish souls in receipt of ``unwanted gifts''. They are likely
to appear in the small ads once again, because if not faulty shops are not
obliged to exchange or replace them. Most of the major High Street names do,
because they trade on their reputation, according to consumer protection
officer, Andy Moynihan, but he warns that shops which depend on selling at the
cheapest price, usually have a policy of not exchanging. A new hazard is
seasonal shops which open in empty premises in the run-up to Christmas and
disappear before the season of returns.
It is a good idea to use a credit card for purchases of individual items which
cost more than #100 according to Alan Adams, because it offers an extra degree
of protection because both the credit card company and the retailer are
responsible and the consumer has the right to take action agianst either or
both. In the case of a trader who has disappeared, for example, someone who had
paid by credit card could expect redress from the credit card company, such as
Access or Visa, but not if using a debit or switch card.

Abbot
makes
#8m bid
for OIS
DRILLING company Abbot Group last night launched an #8.25m takeover bid for
OIS, an Aberdeen firm which provides technical inspection services for the oil,
petrochemical and power generation industries, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Abbot offered one of its own shares for every OIS share - valuing OIS shares at
27.5p. It also offered a cash alternative of 24.5p.
The drilling company approached OIS with an offer six weeks ago. Receiving no
reply, it decided to launch a bid any way.
OIS officials were not immediately available for comment.
Abbot said there was potential for considerable synergy between the two groups.
Both have their UK operations centres in Aberdeen and are heavily engaged in
the offshore oil and gas industry.
``The board of Abbot believes that there is considerable potential to improve
the performance of OIS. This will be achieved by a combination of
cross-marketing of the enlarged group's services to a broader customer base and
opportunities to collaborate on major projects and develop business for the
combined group in new geographic areas,'' the company said in a statement.
Abbot said there were also savings to be made by eliminating the duplication of
head offices.
Abbot chairman Alasdair Locke said OIS had delivered disappointing profit and
dividend performances since it was floated on the Stock Exchange three years
ago and was unlikely to improve under its present management.
``The fundamental problems of OIS under its present management run so deep
that there can be little foreseeable chance of significant improvement in
levels of profit and dividends,'' he said.
OIS shares were floated at 50p, but had been below 25p for the last three
months. The announcement of Abbot's bid, just before the market closed, pushed
them up 7p to 25p.
Abbot shares fell 3p to 52p.

<HEADLINE>Surgeon cleared of abortion during hysterectomy charge</HEADLINE>

A SURGEON who performed a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman was cleared
yesterday of carrying out an illegal abortion.
Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Reginald Dixon, 59, was found not
guilty of procuring a miscarriage on part-time college lecturer Barbara Whiten,
38.
He said later he would return to work in the operating theatre within the next
few days.
After the verdict, childless Mrs Whiten broke down and sobbed before being led
from the court by her husband and two stepsons.
During the three-week trial at Nottingham Crown Court she had claimed the
surgeon had ``flippantly'' told her she had been pregnant, the day after
carrying out a full abdominal hysterectomy at Kings Mill Hospital,
Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, on March 8, 1993.
After the verdict, Mr Dixon said: ``It is a great relief to see the end of
nearly three years of severe stress for me, my family and, of course poor Mrs
Whiten.''
Mrs Whiten had been referred to Mr Dixon after being diagnosed as having
endometriosis, a womb disease.
Despite telling nurses she had not had a period for three months, no checks
were made to see if she was pregnant before she was wheeled into theatre and
met Mr Dixon briefly before being anaesthetised.
He was charged, after a lengthy investigation by Nottinghamshire police, under
the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.
The jury of seven men and five women took two hours and 10 minutes to return
their unanimous verdict.
Mr Dixon's counsel, Ms Nicola Davies QC, said he had acted in good faith under
the emergency procedures of the 1967 Abortion Act which allows surgeons to
abort a foetus if they believe the continuation of the pregnancy could cause
grave or permanent mental injury to the patient.
The court heard Mrs Whiten, of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, had a history of depression
and had twice tried to commit suicide.
She broke down as she said in evidence: ``I would have loved to have a baby.''
Mrs Whiten, who has been treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, said Mr
Dixon told her of the pregnancy during his ward round.
She said: ``He got to the bottom of the bed, looked over his shoulder and said:
`By the way, the womb was rather swollen and I suspected there was a pregnancy
but I carried on because that was what you would have wanted.'
``I didn't believe what I was hearing. Then he just walked away. I was
absolutely shocked, horrified.''
She denied ever telling other doctors that she did not want to become pregnant
and said she agreed to the hysterectomy after being told it was the only way to
cure her painful condition.
Mr Dixon said he was faced with a ``quandary'' when he realised his patient
might be pregnant.
After checking her notes, in which junior doctors had stated she did not want
to be pregnant, he decided to continue the operation, bearing in mind her age,
mental history, and the possibility the foetus may have been damaged by male
hormones she had been taking.
Later, Mrs Whiten's solicitors said in a statement ``Mr and Mrs
Whiten.......have not had time to think about the verdict or any civil action
and they both want some time on their own. They are going to go home and
hopefully get some rest.''
Kings Mill Hospital said: ``This case has been very stressful for all those
involved, particularly Mr Dixon and Mrs Whiten.'' It had also been distressing
for the staff and patients of Kings Mill, ``who have the utmost respect for Mr
Dixon professionally and personally''.
The statement added: ``We are pleased that, following the verdict, Mr Dixon can
continue his work......'' He has worked at the hospital for 13 years.
Mrs Whiten was 11 weeks pregnant with a son when the operation was performed.

OH, WHAT joy it is. Americans are thrilled and delighted at having some real
news, the royal divorce, after all that dreary stuff about the budget and the
blizzards. All the papers are full of it this morning. The talk shows were
abuzz with semi-informed gossip and the British ambassador has been summoned to
brief the Washington Post.
Sir John Kerr was, in fact, invited to lunch at the Post some time ago, to meet
the publisher, Mrs Katherine Graham, and all the editors. The lunch is today
and no doubt there will be a brief, ernest discussion of matters Irish and
transatlantic. But what they will all want to talk about is divorce, scandal,
and will Princess Di get the vacant title of Duchess of Windsor.
British journalists are popping up on CNN and other shows to offer their
well-prepared analyses of the significance of unpublished royal letters and
questions unasked in royal interviews. Is James Hewitt really trying to sell
the princesses's letters? One of the supermarket tabloids claimed to have seen
them and published steamy extracts a week ago. Why was Mr Carling not mentioned
by the Beeb?
The phrase ``fairytale wedding'' echoes across the airwaves and the name
Cinderella is heard in the land. For a republic, America is extraordinarily
interested in the British monarchy. All the networks are planning specials this
evening, with more film clips of fairytale wedding and talking heads,
especially royal talking heads, giving the shows such names as Battle Royal.
They are saving that old chestnut, Gone With the Windsors, for later.
The princess was in New York 10 days ago, a one-day trip to take part in a
charity dinner. The paparrazzi camped outside her hotel during her entire time
in the city and were disappointed when she sneaked out the back.
Mr Henry Kissinger greeted her at the dinner with a kiss on each cheek. We
didn't know until then that they were such pals, or that royalty had sunk to
the level of minor, kissable film stars. One of the Brito-pundits on CNN today
suggested that she will move into the Trump Tower in New York, home-from-home
for various celebrities.
It is less elegant than the chateau in the Bois de Boulogne where the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor ended their days as guests of the French Government but New
York can absorb famous exiles quite easily - and Mr Donald Trump can guarantee
privacy for the most camera-shy ex-princess.

AS a royal marriage reaches its bitter concluding chapter, it is an excusable
occasion, even if only of prurient interest, to recall some royal marriages
that might have been. Here's a resume of those who didn't make it.
When American Koo Stark snuck off to Mustique with Prince Andrew in '82, the
BBC aired snippets from a work of art in which she starred called Emily. Koo,
it came to light, was a soft porn actress.
Other demanding roles had included playing the lead in Cool Passion, an
innocent girl who refuses to pleasure nuns, who is sodomised by a Lord, savaged
by dogs, and raped by two graverobbers to the sounds of Wagner, Vivaldi, and
Berlioz.
``Koo would make someone a perfect wife,'' said Mr Wilbur Stark, her father,
when the revelations hit the fan. ``She is a very selective girl.'' Obviously.
But what about Prince Andrew himself, 22 at the time, a man who allegedly told
the Queen that ``girls who live with mummy and daddy, ride horses, and take
secretarial courses simply don't interest me at all''.
The press and the palace duly decreed that given her, ahem, body of work, Koo
had no morals, and therefore was an unsuitable partner for the prince.
Of course they hadn't met the future wife yet, Sarah ``Fergie'' Ferguson, the
topless, toe-sucking children's novelist.
And what about the sad case of Group Captain Peter Townsend, Second World War
pilot, hero, equerry, and lover of Princess Margaret? They were doomed, doomed.
The princess publicly announced that she would not marry him and the nation,
still somewhat shaken by the abdication of Edward VIII to marry Wallis Simpson,
was reassured.
However, the palace has always promulgated a freaky interpretation of human
emotion, to which Townsend, judging by this statement, made in a 1978
interview, had already succumbed: ``If you spend all your time in bed making
love, you can't win battles. All passion dies after six months or a year. I am
faithful to duty. If Margaret had wanted it, I would have married her. We
didn't part with tears in our eyes. We just felt like a stiff drink.''
There is still, however, the unresolved matter of Mrs Camilla Parker-Bowles,
married, divorced and, as always, available. She allegedly approved of Diana
but probably as breeding stock.
Camilla would not have tended the sick and needy. Not for her the Aids crusade.
If she had made it to princess, she would probably have raised the profile of
horse charities.

Up spoke the men of Knoydart; ``Away and shut your trap.
For the word of a Saxon brewer's boy we just don't give a rap.
We're all of us ex-Servicemen who fought against the Hun.
We know our enemies by now - and Brocket, you are one.''
HAMISH Henderson's great anthem marked almost the last land raids in the
Highlands, carried out by men returning from the Second World War and
confronted with the horrible irony that the land they coveted, in order to live
and work in the place of their birth, was still owned by Lord Brocket - one of
Adolf Hitler's leading British admirers.
Brocket Hall was Britain's Vichy-in-waiting. Now it is a conference centre
whose owner, the third Baron Brocket, had #20m of vintage cars in the garage.
Most of us, if we needed the money in that position, might have thought of
selling a few of them. But there is nothing straightforward about the British
aristocracy. How much craftier to chop them up and melt them down!
I would like to think that among the vestiges of local population in Knoydart
this week, a toast was sipped to the fall of the House of Brocket. All good
things are worth waiting for. And the descent of the third Baron, alias Charles
Ronald George Nall-Cain, could scarcely have been more spectacular.
Unfortunately, it was not yet the descent into the cells. After Brocket (Eton
and the Hussars) admitted trying to swindle two insurance companies out of
#4.5m, Judge Rodwell let him out for Christmas ``so that he might be allowed to
attend to matters of deep family concern''. (If my constituents tried that one
in Kilmarnock Sheriff Court they would probably get an extra 30 days.)
Perhaps the suite of well-appointed cells recently vacated by Mr Darius Guppy
have not yet been refurbished. Or maybe Lord Brocket will use the time to
consult the same physician who diagnosed Alzheimer's disease in Ernest
Saunders, leading to his release (on compassionate grounds) and subsequent
miraculous recovery. The law works in mysterious ways.
The Brocket baronetcy was bought from Lloyd George in 1921 for the equivalent
of #500,000. For that reason and no other, the third Lord Brocket retains a
season ticket with full speaking and voting rights to the House of Lords where
he takes the Conservative Whip.
Neither has he been shy about exercising these rights. In the light of his
conviction as a swindler on the grand scale, some of his contributions to the
columns of the House of Lords' Hansard have acquired an added piquancy.
For instance, he was very keen under rule of law during the miners' strike,
demanding action against pickets who ``constitute a threat to law and order and
to freedom of the individual''.
Then there was Lord Brocket on the poll tax: ``No socially minded person could
possibly disagree with the principle . . . I can thoroughly recommend to the
poll tax demonstrators in Wandsworth the game of cricket, or perhaps rugby, if
they are at a loose end.''
Lord Brocket confirmed his Thatcherite credentials in an economic debate: ``The
Government, quite correctly I believe, have changed the country's thinking in
that it is admirable to be successful and this natural inclination to
accumulate wealth is neither perverted nor in any way wrong.'' Tell that to the
insurance companies!
With power of hindsight however, Lord Brocket's most revealing contribution to
their Lordships' House came during a debate on the DTI report on the Al Fayeds
and the House of Fraser: ``It may well be that a rosier picture was painted of
their wealth. But which one of us has not at some time discouraged our bank
from believing that our assets are a little greater than they are? It is only a
matter of degree.''
The next line of Hansard reads: ``Noble Lords; `Oh!''' Lord Brocket had
apparently done the impossible. He had shocked the House of Lords on the
subject of money. The following speaker - Lord Longford, whom he might now get
to know better - chastised him: ``I believe that a lie is a lie, and if you lie
for a period of time you are a discredited person.''
All good fun, but the incredible point is that these were contributions to
debates in what is theoretically the highest debating Chamber. And just as
happened regularly between 1974-79, Lord Brocket (if available) will be able to
vote with the rest of them to obstruct and delay a Labour Government's
legislation.
That is not a marginal point of democracy, but a central one. The first Lord
Brocket bought the title. The second Lord Brocket was pro-Nazi. The third Lord
Brocket is a convicted fraudster. But the fourth and fourteenth Lords Brocket,
unless something is done, will still be in there legislating.
Thankfully, something is going to be done. Labour is committed to removing the
voting rights of hereditary peers - a small and woefully belated step in the
right direction. When it comes to discussions about availability of
parliamentary time, I trust that the wretched name of Brocket is not forgotten.
``We know our enemies by now - and Brocket, you are one.''

DR ALAN Pithie, a consultant in infectious diseases at Ruchill Hospital in
Glasgow lists the symptoms of bacterial meningitis as a severe headache,
drowsiness and a fever. In 50% of cases a fine rash also occurs, which blanches
on pressure.
``Not all the symptoms may occur,'' he says, ``but those that do will develop
simultaneously.''
The symptoms develop quickly and are similar to those of flu. This makes
knowing when to call in a doctor a problem.
As well as causing inflammation of the meninges - the lining of the brain - the
bacterium can cause generalised septicaemia - blood poisoning.
According to the Menigitis Research Foundation the main symptoms to look out
for in this case are: a high fever which may not be initially present,
shivering and cold hands and feet, a rash, nausea and vomiting, rapid
breathing, drowsiness, severe muscular aches, abdominal pain and sometimes
diarrhoea.
Septicaemia can occur with or without meningitis. The trigger symptom is the
rash of tiny pink spots which later develop into larger purple, bruise like
marks.
According to the foundation a simple test for septicaemia is to press a glass
against the rash. A septicaemic rash will not fade and will remain visible
through the glass.

SPECULATION that Camilla Parker Bowles could one day become Queen Camilla has
been rife ever since news of her intimate relationship with the Prince of Wales
first emerged.
Just how deep their friendship ran was first detailed in Andrew Morton's
biography of the Princess of Wales.
However, it was the prince's public admission of adultery in the Dimbleby TV
interview last year that fuelled speculation he might eventually remarry - to
48-year-old Mrs Parker Bowles.
The princess herself confirmed her estranged husband had long been in love with
Mrs Parker Bowles with her comment in last month's Panorama interview: ``There
were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.''
Yesterday's statement from the prince's press secretary that the heir to the
throne has no plans to remarry effectively means Mrs Parker Bowles must confine
her role in the prince's life to that of mistress.
One obstacle to a possible royal union with her was removed earlier this year
when her marriage to Andrew Parker Bowles ended after 21 years.
It also appeared, from opinion polls, that even the public, initially hostile
to the notion of Charles and Camilla becoming husband and wife, were beginning
to warm to the prospect.
Mrs Parker Bowles's refusal to talk publicly about her affair with the prince
has made her a figure about whom little is known.
She has, at the same time, helped to win round some sections of the
establishment who admire her discretion.
Hardened royal watchers had little success in lifting the veil of secrecy which
has shrouded her private life and, despite an almost constant media spotlight,
Mrs Parker Bowles has managed to maintain an almost dignified mystique.
The only insight into the woman who has entranced the Prince of Wales since
they first met 25 years ago has come from more outspoken members of her family.
Her former brother-in-law, Mr Richard Parker Bowles, told the Mail on Sunday
last month that Camilla was a ``wrecker''.
He claimed she was ``made of teak'' and actually encouraged Diana to marry
Charles because she thought she could manipulate the young princess.
``When it came to Prince Charles, Camilla always knew that she held his
heart,'' he added.
Political opinion has been shifting gradually towards the idea of the prince
marrying Mrs Parker Bowles.
In a poll of MPs conducted by the Sunday Times last weekend, exactly 50% of
Labour Members who responded believed the union should be allowed to take place.
Only 26% of Tory MPs thought the prince would be able to wed his mistress and
become king.
Before yesterday's dramatic announcement, there had been mounting speculation
among privy counsellors and MPs that Mrs Parker Bowles could take the title
queen consort if she was married to Prince Charles when he was crowned king.
Many agree Camilla would have made the ideal wife for Charles, with their
mutual love of hunting and the outdoors.
They are similar in age - Charles, at 47, is a year younger than his mistress -
unlike the gap of 13 years between him and Diana.
Mrs Parker Bowles has an intriguing historical link with royalty as her
great-grandmother Alice Kepple was mistress to Edward VII.

WHEN the going gets tough, the tough go shopping, but even the most
battle-hardened need a break sometimes, and the lunchtime search for a
restaurant is on.
It might be adding insult to injury - after all, you've just spent next month's
rent money on presents for the family there - but the canteen in the department
store is awfully convenient and lo and behold, they're serving Christmas lunch.
But is it worth the visit? The Herald sent out some of the toughest testers in
the business, members of the Strathclyde Elderly Forum pensioners' action
group, to see what they made of the festive fare at Glasgow's department stores
and supermarkets.
The response was an almost universal ``Could Do Better''. Cold food and long
queues were frequent complaints, but where staff were friendly and helpful the
store immediately scored higher marks. Christmas shopping over? Then let's get
stuck in.
n.Store: Debenhams, Argyle Street.
Tester: Edward Traynor.
Meal: Turkey, peas, roast potatoes and cranberry sauce; passion cake; #5.59.
Overall rating: good.
Would you recommend it? Yes.
``There was nothing I particularly liked or disliked, but the place was almost
full at 12.45pm.''
n.Store: Frasers, Buchanan Street.
Tester: Nan Masson.
Meal: Turkey, sprouts, carrots; Christmas pudding; #6.95.
Overall rating: Poor.
Would you recommend it? No.
``The meat course was cold, the bacon round the sausages was dried out and the
stuffing was horrible, but the Christmas pudding and brandy sauce was hot and
tasty. If they can produce a Christmas lunch for #7 they could at least serve
it hot!''
n.Store: BHS, Sauchiehall Street.
Testers: Betty Porter and Mrs JM Gilchrist.
Meal: Turkey, sprouts, carrots, potatoes, sausage stuffing; Christmas pudding,
coffee; #6.04.
Overall rating: poor.
Would you recommend it? No.
``The meal was cold and when returned for heating there was very little
difference. We were not offered cranberry sauce although it was listed.''
``Disappointing generally for such an establishment. Poor display for Christmas
meal and difficult to read.''
n.Store: C&amp;A, Trongate.
Testers: George Bennie and Duncan Munro.
Meal: Turkey with sausage stuffing and trimmings; trifle; #3.99.
Overall rating: average.
Would you recommend it? Yes - but only for the price.
``Meal could have been warmer.''
``The veg was over-salted for my taste, but the turkey portion and quality was
good.''
n.Store: Woolworth, Argyle Street.
Testers: Sarah Hart and Jean Smith.
Meal: Turkey, roast potatoes, Duchesse potatoes and peas; milkshake, Christmas
pudding, tea; #4.75.
Overall rating: average.
Would you recommend it? No.
``The wait we had was very poor.''
``We had to wait a long time for the meal. It was a shame for the girls because
they were overworked. They did try their best.''
n.Store: Littlewoods, Argyle Street.
Testers: William and Georgina Pollock.
Meal: Tomato soup, turkey, sausage, stuffing, carrots, sprouts, potatoes; lemon
meringue pie; #7.18.
Overall rating: average.
Would you recommend it? No.
``The cost was too high, but the restaurant was clean and the service good.''
``The meal was fat and greasy, but I liked the soup and the sweet. The service
was quick and the restaurant clean.''
n.Store: Asda, Sylvania Way, Clydebank.
Testers: Rhona Pidgeon and Audrey Wilson.
Meal: Turkey, stuffing, sprouts, potatoes; cappuccino cake and cream; #6.88.
Overall rating: Excellent/ good.

``I particularly liked the friendliness and helpfulness; I haven't visited this
restaurant for a very long time, but I will be back.''
``This is a pleasant, good eating place. I liked the friendliness of the staff
and the cleanliness.''

A THREE-year deal for Vauxhall's 8000 manual workers looks set to increase the
pressure on other UK motor manufacturers to concede a shorter working week.
Under the offer, being recommended by negotiators, Vauxhall workers will
receive a pay rise of 4%, or #12.25 a week - whichever is greater - followed by
rises in line with inflation in the next two years.
The company has also offered to cut an hour off the 39-hour working week,
although a commitment to work 48 hours of overtime during a year has been given
by unions.
Vauxhall workers have been banning overtime and finishing work two hours
earlier on Friday to press for a two-hour reduction. The workforces at Luton
and Ellesmere Port are expected to be balloted on the deal in the new year.
In conceding a cut in the 39-hour week, Vauxhall has made it virtually
impossible for Ford - whose 22,000 blue-collar workers are due to be balloted
on a 9.25% deal over two years with no cut in hours - to avoid doing the same
or be forced to buy off its workforce to retain 39 hours.

AN Edinburgh climbing instructor yesterday was cleared of all blame for the
injuries suffered by a pupil in a fall from a Northumbrian rock face.
Mr Peter Pope, of Molesey in Surrey - who fractured his spine and his left
wrist in the fall - failed in his bid for compensation and was ordered to pay
costs.
Judge Diana Cotton QC said climbing was a dangerous sport and noted that Mr
Pope, 53, had been ``determined'' to blame the 1990 accident on his instructor,
Mr David Cuthbertson.
The judge ruled: ``There was no failure by Mr Cuthbertson either to instruct or
supervise Mr Pope which was causative of the accident.
``I believe that Mr Pope's position throughout has been that he paid for a
guide and that he was entitled to have his safety guaranteed.
``To engage in what even he regarded as a high-risk sport in that frame of mind
was, I consider, foolish.''
Mr Cuthbertson, now 37, of Colinton Mains Road, Edinburgh - a member of the
Association of Mountain Guides - had been Mr Pope's instructor during a
climbing expedition to Back Bowden Doors, Northumbria, in Easter 1990.

THE formal signing tomorrow of the #2000m deal between BP and Sonatrach to
develop the southern Algerian gas fields has far-reaching repercussions which
should be good for both British and European consumers.
But it delivers another nasty blow to British Gas and also to Shell which has a
quarter of its gas reserves in the North Sea as well as substantial gas
distribution interests in Benelux and Germany.
At present, the average cost per therm is about 15p for an industrial user in
the UK which is the lowest price in the western world and about 45% of the cost
of both France and Germany.
The pity is that British Gas is now making losses of perhaps 2p per therm
because of the contracts it entered into to develop gas fields and is now
sitting on a #40bn surplus of gas contracted at 20p per therm.
The private consumer side is still highly profitable but British Gas's market
position is being increasingly undermined by new operators such as Amerada Hess
now offering a 15% discount on annual bills of over #1100 in some parts of
Britain and Total of France another package much the same.
British Gas is trying to offload its long-term surplus into Europe through an
inter-connector to Zeebrugge in three years time and is pressing for it to be
allowed into the Belgian industrial system and also access to Germany. But the
key player is arguably the German chemicals colossus BASF whose Wintershall
subsidiary is importing massive quantities of gas from Russia's Gazprom and is
determined to gain market share at the expense of the more established and
ossified Ruhrgas.
The BP-Sonatrach arrangement will result in gas being supplied through the
Transmed pipe to Italy and later through the Mahgreb system into Spain and
Portugal and so put even greater downward pressure on prices.
Industrial customers in all these countries will benefit before the householder
because they will have greater flexibility in sourcing. But prices will
inevitably fall across the board as more distant producers such as Iran and
Qatar enter the scene with a commodity which does seem to be in global surplus
for at least the next three decades.
Although British Gas is trying all means to be released from its expensive
contracts, it faces the most difficult problems of any of the utilities in 1996
as the European gas market enters a period of fundamental and probably chaotic
restructuring. It is difficult to see it coming out other than covered with
wounds.
Balancing act
THE UK's trading balance with the rest of the world looked a lot healthier than
expected following publication of the third-quarter current account which
includes the beneficial impact of invisible earnings from financial services,
investments and tourism.
According to British Invisibles, a private sector body which promotes
invisibles exports, these continue to show a strong surplus and should come
close to equalling the record #20.4bn recorded in 1994.
This is all to the good and will offset to a great extent the deficit on the
country's visible trade. But they are also primarily responsible for showing up
the precariousness of trying to forecast or estimate the balance of payments.
There are often major revisions to these figures which are after all only
estimates. The second quarter of the current year is a case in point with the
contribution from investment income now revised up from #1500m to #2000m. This
just for one quarter.
Adjustments can amount to a considerable sum, completely changing the
complexion of the balance of pay-    ments not just as the year progresses but
also in the final quarter as has happened in the past.
At the moment the figures are working in Britain's favour and will probably
continue to do so. But it does make nonsense sometimes of all that has gone
before.
Boring Hanson
ONE equity that is unlikely to figure on many 1996 buy lists is Hanson despite
the very poor showing this year, when the shares have underperformed the market
by 26%.
The yield is nudging 8%, twice the market average, and it is difficult to see
what will make the shares turnround. One analyst has described the group's
problems as those of old age which is rather cruel given that its founder and
leader Lord Hanson is now rising 74 but it does sum up the group's predicament.
Growth becomes progressively more difficult as a conglomerate gets larger.
Targets have to get bigger and bigger and as the activities proliferate
poorly-performing areas end up cancelling out the growth sectors and earnings
stagnate.
Conglomeracy has been out of fashion for years now and yet Hanson has not tried
to adapt to the times and still has no strategy except to grow by acquisition,
the latest being Eastern Electricity. Belatedly it is making major divestments
and concentrating on core activities.
The case against Hanson is not so much bearish as boring, with a third of the
group in low-growth areas like tobacco and energy and the bulk of the rest in
building materials and chemicals which are notoriously cyclical.
Some #2000m to be realised from disposals next year will de-gear the balance
sheet but the main problem is cash flow. Eastern will not be the cash cow some
thought because it has a heavy capital spending programme in hand, including
power stations.
Lord Hanson has already ridiculed the idea of the dividend actually being cut
but the point has now been reached where the market would take a dim view if it
was raised, which he would no doubt like to do, as its sustainability would be
in doubt.
There is one way excitement could be rekindled - a massive break-up of the
while group - but Lord Hanson would surely be unable to oversee the
dismemberment of his life's work.

ROYAL divorce chills the constitutional blood of big chiefs in the British
state and the prime difficulty is that of the sovereign's relationship with the
Church of England. In Scotland, the Kirk is merely the national church,
recognised by the state but entirely free from the scrutiny of Parliament and
any executive influence by the monarchy.
The Church of England is a truly established body. The sovereign is its supreme
governor; she, in principle, appoints bishops (though the function is now
devolved to a complex arrangement between Downing Street and the Church
hierarchy) and Parliament still, in theory, directs the Church of England in
matters of doctrine and worship. This was last demonstrated in the famous
stushie of 1928, when the Revised Prayer Book was rejected by Parliament.
The Church of England inclines to a Roman Catholic repudiation of divorce and,
specifically, ecclesiastically sanctioned remarriage after divorce. This is
most ironic. It was through a most famous divorce that the Church of England
split from Rome in the first place.
The claim of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne, nearly 500 years ago, was
somewhat tenuous. Henry VII won the throne only by concluding the Wars of the
Roses and bumping off Richard III. While he strengthened a flimsy claim to
sovereign right by marrying Elizabeth of York - a sister of the princes in the
tower - a good clear succession was vital if the Tudor claim to rule could be
cemented.
Arthur, Prince of Wales, had to make a good marriage. So he wed Catherine of
Aragon and, shortly afterwards, died. Rather than waste a perfectly good bride
and fall out with the Spanish monarchy, his brother Henry duly married
Catherine in turn. This, by canon-law of the time, was technically incestuous.
A Papal dispensation was sought and obtained, on the improbable basis that
Arthur's marriage to Catherine had not been consummated.
However, Henry VIII, as he now was, desperately needed a male heir. Catherine
produced one daughter, Mary, but no surviving boys. No queen regnant had then
sat on the English throne. A female heir could not be chanced. Henry (who was
cursed with a theological mind, as well as a raging ego) became convinced that
his lack of a son was God's righteous judgment. His marriage was unlawful. The
heavens were angry. And Anne Boleyn, who now featured in his life, was both
beautiful and seemingly fertile.
The Pope refused to grant annulment or divorce. He could not afford to insult
Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. So Henry made himself effective Pope of the
Church of England. He even, rather cheekily, arrogated the title of Defender of
the Faith for that role - which the Pope had granted him as a faithful son of
Mother Church.
Catherine died of a broken heart. Anne Boleyn fell from favour, was divorced
and beheaded. Henry divorced his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, because she
proved much uglier than the advertised product. He divorced and beheaded
Catherine Howard too. Small wonder that his two daughters grew up with evident
psycho-sexual problems. Mary's wretched marriage ruined her monarchy, and
Elizabeth, child of Anne Boleyn, never married at all.
Charles II could well have sought a divorce, over a century later, if he had
wanted one. His Queen, Catherine of Braganza, was barren. The Duke of York,
Roman Catholic heir-presumptive, was widely loathed. However, Charles seems
genuinely to have loved his wife and resisted all schemes for her removal. It
is perhaps the only honourable aspect of his disreputable career. It is said
that Charles had married before, to the cheerful tart Lucy Scott - certainly he
made their son Duke of Monmouth - but Charles never admitted this. Otherwise,
the Duke of Roxburghe and Buccleuch would be king.
James succeeded and was overthrown; his little son disinherited. The exiled
House of Stuart was barred from succession and, following the death of James's
daughter Queen Anne in 1714, the Crown passed by statute to George, Elector of
Hanover, great-grandson of James VI, and between whom and the throne at least
38 people had a stronger claim.
George I was already divorced. He was a strange, dull, boorish man who never
spoke more than a few words of English and spent most of his reign in Germany.
By 1714, he had savagely repudiated his wife, Sophia Dorothea - who had
foolishly embarked on a very obvious affair - executed the lover, divorced the
wretched Sophia Dorothea, and slapped her in a grim Hanoverian tower. There at
length she died. She never saw Britain and was never queen. George I did not
remarry and, in 1727, their son George II succeeded him.
When George III became king in 1760, he had to make a good marriage. There is
an abundant evidence that he was married already - to an obscure Quaker lassie
- but the bond was secret and easily set aside. George married Charlotte of
Mecklenberg-Strelitz. It is said that, some years later, she learned of the
earlier ceremony - the lady involved was now dead - and, mortified at the
thought of living in sin, insisted on a second marriage service with George,
drolly disguised as a ``turn'' in a masqued ball. (If this is true and the
additional wedding followed the birth of Edward, Duke of Kent, in 1776 -
Victoria's father - then he was a bastard and our whole royal house
illegitimate.
By now royal marriage was fraught with legislation. The Act of Settlement of
1701 forbade any Roman Catholic, or the spouse of a Roman Catholic, from
succession. George III - whose relationship with his sons was diabolical -
forced through the Royal Marriages Act, forbidding any of his descendants to
marry without the sovereign's permission, until they had reached the age of 25.
(This is still on the statute book, so the Queen must be bothered by a lot of
obscure relatives.) What provoked George to this was that his son, the Prince
of Wales, had secretly married a Roman Catholic wifie, Maria Fitzherbert.
Nevertheless, the young man was compelled to ignore this and proceed with a
grand wedding to Princess Caroline of Brunswick. Caroline was fat, washed
seldom, ate messily, and smelled. ``I need brandy,'' gasped the prince to his
valet when the lovebirds first met, and at the ceremony itself he was so drunk
he could scarcely stand.
George loathed his new wife and, at length, when her debauches became the talk
of tout Londres, tried to divorce her. (He was now Prince Regent, his father
having gone quite mad.) The celebrated ``Delicate Investigation'' was launched
in Parliament. The quotes and evidence still make good reading but the divorce
was denied; the mob, in true English fashion, stormed the streets on Caroline's
behalf. In 1820, George III died. George IV refused to acknowledge his wife as
queen and when she turned up for the coronation she was denied admittance. She
left, storming and cursing, and died soon after.
When George IV died in 1830 - ``there can scarcely be a wet eye in the kingdom
for this debauched monarch'', The Times editorialised sourly - they found,
rather sweetly, a miniature of Maria Fitzherbert in a locket on his breast.
In the long reign of his niece Victoria - despite the cheerful carnality of her
own heir - the royal family became respectable. It fell to her great-grandson,
Edward VIII, to revive old torments.
Edward succeeded George V in January 1936 and he was maniacally in love with
Mrs Wallis Simpson, who was married already and who had previous spouse still
living. She would happily have remained the king's mistress and this his
Ministers would have tolerated.
However, when he applied for divorce in the late autumn, it became apparent
that Edward, in all seriousness, meant to marry her. Technically, he had every
right to do so. The sovereign could marry whom he chose but he was readily
tricked into seeking the counsel of the Cabinet. He was thereafter bound, by
constitutional precedent, to follow the advice of his Government, and the
governments of the dominions.
Mrs Simpson was an American and a commoner. She was also a lady with of shady
past and dubious connections. That was enough to hang her in political eyes but
her marital past was sufficient excuse to resist the king's desire. The Church
of England now had a Catholic view of divorce: basically, that marriage was a
sacrament and a true marriage could not be broken. A marriage of the Supreme
Governor to a divorced lady was unacceptable.
Edward VIII, in other respects, was unacceptable already. Mrs Simpson's divorce
could readily have been blocked and the whole abdication avoided. That no
effort was made to do so is significant.
By the time George VI died, in 1952, folk in high places knew that his younger
daughter, Princess Margaret, was in love with his equerry, Group-Captain Peter
Townsend. Townsend was handsome, gracious, witty, and a war hero. He was also
divorced. He had been the innocent party in the divorce - granted on the basis
of his wife's adultery - but he was divorced.
The crisis bubbled on for several years, until - with the implacable will of
her mother, the Church of England hierarchy, and Anthony Eden's Cabinet against
her - threatening loss of royal status, wealth, and protection if she dared so
to wed - Margaret turned 25 and was free, in law, to decide for herself. It was
useless.
``You may put your books away, Archbishop,'' she said sadly, when the smarmy
Fisher came with his latest battery of tomes and lecture-notes, ``I have
decided not to marry the group-captain.''
``What a wonderful person the Holy Spirit is!'' exclaimed the cleric.
Margaret, in 1960, married Anthony Armstrong-Jones. By the end of the decade,
the bond was in deep trouble and, in 1976 - somewhat smothered by Wilson's
resignation and the breaking of the Thorpe scandal - the Snowdon's separation
was announced. Divorce duly followed in 1978.
Margaret was marginalised and unpopular. Damage to the House of Windsor was
minimal. Surely there could be no more divorce scandals in the close-knit House
of Windsor?
We ken noo.

A MAN cleared on appeal of murdering a woman during a sex attack was jailed
yesterday for 18 months for two indecent assaults.
Wayne Darvell had carried out the attacks after being released from prison by
the Court of Appeal.
Darvell, 35, was jailed for life in 1986 and served seven years for the murder
in a Swansea sex shop the previous year of an employee, Ms Sandra Phillips, 38.
She had been sexually assaulted and petrol was splashed over her body.
Darvell's campaign to be freed was led by the BBC's Rough Justice TV programme.
It succeeded in 1992 because of doubts about prosecution evidence.
Darvell, of Neath, West Glamorgan, was jailed at Swansea Crown Court yesterday
for indecent assaults on girls aged 17 and 13.
In August last year, he was fined #250 for an indecent assault on a legal
secretary in a Neath alleyway.
After Darvell and his co-accused brother, Paul, had their 1986 murder
convictions quashed, three policemen were charged with attempting to pervert
the course of justice. They were cleared by a jury.

JOURNO Ken Roy once wrote a profile about yer Urban V here. Said he looked
forward to my autobiography and hoped I finished it before my heart attack.
(Ken, like many others, suspects that my vigorous approach to life will result
in an early demise. It is not always like this. Archie Hind, the novelist and
critic, was telephoned once by an aged cousin who told him that his uncle Andy,
aged 92, had died in his sleep. ``He wis nivver the same,'' said the crone,
efter he wis gassed in the First War......'')
But this Roy may be right at that. Every Christmas sees my heart attack mair
likely. It is Christmas that does it.
I hate Christmas: I write this every year. I was listening to a wireless
Scotland programme in which a lady journalist examined the curious notion that
women get the worst of it at Yuletide. You know the drivel: the women do all
the cooking of the various beasts laid in front of them and the men just go
down the pub.
In the case of most lady journalists if I was their man I would forego the
turkey and trimmings and have organised the air-tickets to Bermuda months back.
But I am not married to a lady journalist: in fact I am not married at all. But
I still get rubbish at Christmas.
Far from women doing all the work at the Festive, it is the men who are given
all the unnecessary guilt. For a start, for years I did the Christmas dinner
and enjoyed it. My own brother does, with the willing acceptance of his partner
who doesn't even resent being told what to do in the matter of the duxelles
because, goddamit, my brother does the bloody cooking all the year round anyway.
Yet I have a wee feeling that I am not right here. I mean, my brother loves
Christmas. His little eyes are shining with the prospect of the fairy lights
strung across his soul and psyche. His daughter, a teenage lass who at present
makes Gertrude Lawrence appear a rubicund milk-maid from an Ivor Novello
operetta, she is that sophisticated, is aghast at my younger brother's dreadful
enthusiasm. But for myself I like it.
Jaded as I feel, the sight of a 46-year-old man jouking round the most obscure
electrical shops for the one fairy light which will let the others work at all,
or the sheer vision of the foolish chap making his own marzipan and flaming the
brandy for his version of fruit mincemeat one can perfectly easily purchase out
of a Robertson's jar...... Jesus, you should see him on Chrstmas morning when
he stands above you like Jules Streicher in jack boots, just to make sure you
open your presents. He wraps his presents with more glittering packaging than
Tony Blair has ever thought up.
And last year I enjoyed Christmas because of his relentless and childish glee
at Chrissie. I enjoyed as splendid a dinner as one could imagine in the house
of wee George Quar, Scottish telly chef, he of the bow-tie, ready quip, and
ex-Allan Glen's boy, whit else? But yet I still hate Christmas, and suspect the
heart attack is nearing. It does each year and nothing to do with overeating or
drinking too much: I do that every day as it is.
Ken Roy, the journalist who predicted my early shuffle off should know this.
You should see me at this time of year when the amateurs are out. Especially
the amateur professionals.
I can - just - put up with the novices who fondly imagine they can drink like
Brendan Behan in New York, the last days. I can do a deefy to those who turn up
once a year simply to tell me that there is another wean on the way and they
don't bother reading John Macleod. The other way round would be interesting
though not as peculiar a juxtaposition.
What I can't manage is pubs shutting early and publicans not giving me a wee
lock-in because they are pissed off by the sudden incursion of the public and
then take it out on me. Or TOA taxis who don't bother coming in the pub to tell
you that your taxi has arrived and when you ring the blaggards you are informed
that you should have been waiting in the snaw/sleet/rain/cauld for a taxi
driver.
Damned glad they were to have you the rest of the year. Contempt for the public
should be consistent and not just confined to Yuletide. This is where the heart
attack comes. When I can't get a cab or a drink or a table in a restaurant and
when the wireless tells me how wonderful the family is and the blatts tell me
that single people are at fault for their own misery at this time of year.
Happy Christmas. And not a Christmas card either, to any of you. Wait till New
Year and I'll have the heart attack then. No, later.

AN alleged Hanger 13 drugs dealer is to stand trial - accused of attempting the
impossible.
It is alleged that Mr James Docherty believed he was in possession of ecstasy,
although the 20 tablets turned out not to be a controlled drug at all.
The prosecution has been made possible by a Court of Criminal Appeal ruling
that it can be a crime under Scots law to attempt to do something which is
physically impossible.
The decision brings the law of Scotland into line with England. Last week,
22-year-old Louise Skidmore, a former British international synchronised
swimmer, was jailed for two years in Plymouth for offering tablets she
mistakenly thought were ecstasy.
Mr Docherty, 24, of Queen Mary Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow, was charged with, at
Hanger 13, Pavilion Road, Ayr, in November 1994, taking possession of 20
tablets which he believed contained ecstasy with intent to supply and
attempting to have the class A drug with intent to supply it.
He argued at Ayr Sheriff Court that this was not a competent charge under Scots
law and took the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal after his plea was
rejected.
The case went before five judges because they had to reconsider previous
three-judge decisions dating back more than 60 years.
The leading judgment was delivered by Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, who
heard the appeal with Lord Justice General Hope and Lords Sutherland, Cameron,
and Johnston.
Lord Ross said it was essential to bear in mind that an attempt to commit a
crime was a different offence from committing the complete crime.
There could be no question of an accused committing a crime which was
impossible to commit. The most that he could be guilty of in these
circumstances would be an attempt to commit the offence.
``The fact that it is impossible to commit the complete crime does not, in my
opinion, preclude the Crown from charging an accused with an attempt to commit
the crime.
``I see nothing illogical in an accused being charged with attempting to commit
a crime which is impossible of achievement.
``A man may be convicted of an attempt to steal by putting his hand towards
another man's pocket with the object of stealing money, even though there was
nothing in the pocket to steal.''
Because he had taken steps towards committing the crime, he could be convicted
of attempted theft.
Lord Ross added that a previous statement by a judge in 1928 that ``to attempt
to do what is physically impossible can never be a crime'' was an unsound
statement of the law.
He also disapproved of a ruling in a case from 1937 that before the Crown could
charge someone with attempting to procure an abortion the woman must be
pregnant.
He added, however, that the belief of the accused was a relevant consideration.
In a case like the present one, the Crown had to allege that the accused
believed that the tablets in his possession contained a controlled drug.
``If he did not believe that, the charge of attempting to commit the crime
could not succeed.''
Lord Ross gave a number of hypothetical examples - a man who tried to
assassinate a corpse or a bolster in a bed believing them to be live bodies, or
taking away an umbrella with intent to steal only to discover later that it was
your own umbrella.
``I am satisfied that all these instances would constitute relevant charges of
attempt to commit the complete offence because the accused had the necessary
criminal intent and had taken positive steps to carry out his purpose.''
Lord Johnston gave other examples of cases where a charge of attempting to
commit a crime which turned out to be impossible could be brought - attempted
rape of a tranvestite where the attacker thought the victim was a woman, and
attempted bigamy where the accused believed his first wife was alive although
she was in fact dead.
All five judges agreed that the charge against Mr Docherty should stand and
refused his appeal.

MENINGITIS strikes fear into parents every winter as they read of an outbreak
here, a death there. Statistics indicating that it isn't really on the
increase, that there is no pattern to it, that death or serious after-effects
are rare, are of little comfort to the unlucky few.
In fact there are about 2000 cases every year in the UK of bacterial
meningitis, the most serious variety, and one case in ten proves fatal.
Dr Leslie Smart, who monitors notifications at Ruchill Hospital in Glasgow,
said: ``Every time someone dies it hits the headlines, and rightly so. It is
important to get treatment as quickly as possible, so parents should be on the
look-out for signs and symptoms.''
One of the enduring mysteries is why a relatively common organism can come out
of the blue to strike down young children or teenagers with such devastating
results, leaving others around them untouched.
It is a mystery which Dr Caroline Blackwell and fellow microbiologists at
Edinburgh University have dedicated themselves to solving.
They have found themslves in a sinister world of viruses which pave the way for
the meningococcal bacteria to take hold, and of germs which use the body's own
defences - the white cells - as Trojan horses to ride through the circulation
and nervous system.
Some of these phenomena may hold the answer to many cases of cot death as well
as meningitis - alhough they are separate disorders there are eerie parallels
between the two.
``We are looking at inherited characteristics, viruses and cigarette smoke to
determine why one child in a group is susceptible and not another,'' Dr
Blackwell said yesterday.
``One of the factors we are interested in is why virus infection might make
people more susceptible, because there have been reports of an upsurge in cases
of meningitis after a flu outbreak.''
Babies under two are unlikely to have had flu before they contract meningitis -
but every winter thousands of them are affected by Respiratory Syncytial Virus,
(RSV), and many require treatment in hospital intensive care units.
Dr Blackwell and her colleagues believe there may be a legacy from this illness
in the form of a substance which makes the cells lining the baby's nose and
throat stickier, allowing the meningococcal bacteria to get a better hold.
``It may be something new, or the RSV may be increasing the levels of something
which exists naturally,'' she said.
Normally the presence of the bacteria - which can be found in about 10% of the
population at any one time with no ill effect - helps the baby to develop
immunity.
``It might be that the sticky substance leads to greater numbers building up
until an opportunity emerges for them to hop into the blood and nervous system,
without triggering the white cell's immune response.
``Antibodies which encounter these germs normally coat them and get them into
the white cell to be killed off. In the absence of the antibody they get in by
the back door.
``People who don't have the antibody, like babies and young children, may not
have been exposed at low level in order to gain immunity.
``This normally grows in strength up to the age of 12, by which time mos
children are immune.
``But they may still encounter a strain of bacteria to which they have not
acquired immunity - different groups of meningococci have different overcoats
to which the antibodies stick and help the white cells remove bacteria from he
blood.''
Investigations into the role of cigarette smoke have taken Dr Blackwell's team
to Greece, in a project sponsored by the Greek health ministry, the Athens
School of Public Health and the Meningitis Association of Scotland.
``There could be two effects - children who live with smokers may be more
susceptible to virus infection - which might also account for the higher rates
of cot-death among babies in smoking households,'' she said.
``Or it could be that people who smoke are more likely to be carriers of the
organism. We have found, for example, that teenage smokers are more likely to
have the meningococcal bacteria, but active smoking does not appear to be a
risk factor for meningitis.''
Previous studies have shown that children who live with smokers are at an
increased risk of the disease, and Dr Blackwell's team found their own evidence
for this in Greece, where children whose mothers or grannies smoked were more
likely to be carriers of the meningococcus bug.
This effect was not replicated in smoking fathers; those who were responsible
for children's care through the day were the key.

SILENT night? Forget it. The little town of Bethlehem lying still in a
dreamless sleep? Oh, please. Forget all those Christmas cards with their
placid, beatless cores and dusted, hobbling old words. Nowadays, in clubland,
nothing is calm, though all remains bright, and Glasgow is no little town
devoid of dreams. Club-culture turns silence into blistering sound and sleep
into something that the body can wait for. Today it is becoming almost
traditional for people to spend Christmas Eve and Hogmanay in the hot bosom of
a club on the helter-skelter ride of sound, light, energy and dance.
Traditional? too strong a word for it? Well, perhaps. Increasingly popular is
probably a more realistic term, but Christmas and New Year clubbing is not far
from reaching traditiondom. Yet what character does seasonal clubbing have that
warrants such popularity?
Once through the door, dressed-up, supped-up, buoyed-up for the night's events,
club-goers can naturally expect to find different experiences on different
nights at different venues.
First of all, it has to be understood that there are two main club camps: the
devotional clubber who is serious and analytical about venues, DJs, musical
trends and the effects of dry ice on the unborn child, and the cheddar-clubber
who loves all things cheesy, a mild Madonna track, a mature handbag and a
crumbly old Sugar Daddy to spread her dreams on buttered toast. The
devotional-clubber will pay homage in venues like The Tunnel, The Arches, The
Sub-Club and the Arena. The cheddar-clubber follows the strong scent to
Cleopatra's, The Cotton Club and Victoria's where they will encounter chart
hits, seasonal singalong songs and typical chintzy, sparkly party decor. But
both divisions want to party as much as the other at the end of the year -
after all, partying knows no social barriers, is no respecter of age or race.
The very act of partying is, in itself, definitely traditional.
Over the past few years the strongest tradition of festive clubbing has been an
increase in entry fees to capitalise on the surfeit of hungry clubbers
desperate to devour a clubbing experience. Did someone - above the clamouring
party sounds - say ``exploitation''?
``Christmas and New Year has always been a good excuse for clubs to make a lot
of money,'' agrees Stephen Faulkner of Reds on Sauchiehall Street, a club that
falls nicely between the crass and the credible, ``We're keeping our prices
down, and still having drink promotion nights in the hope that people loyal to
the club will come to us throughout the season, not just for a couple of
nights.''
Happily, the club promoters' and owners' desire for a fast festive buck seems
to have kept its head lower than usual this year, many clubs are endeavouring
to keep their entry charges at a typical amount for their venue, but the big
bad wolf of growing competition between clubs could have more to do with this
than a charitable change of heart.
And yet, for all its growing success, clubs are still unsure quite what to do
with Christmas Eve and Hogmanay. Devotional clubbers have only recently found a
New Year countdown in their favourite venues, due to the seriousness that house
and techno music initially inspired. Nowadays, the genres have a little more
sense of humour, but clubs are still uncertain just how far to exercise it. And
because guest DJs are hard to find as few disc-spinners want to be in a strange
city slaving over hot decks on such important nights, most venues fudge, they
mish-mash, they throw something together. The nights are like empty vessels
with ineffectual tinsel rudders that mean it could sail off in any number of
directions; not exactly a luxurious yacht, and no-one really steering the
evening.
``The way we see our nights at The Tunnel,'' says Brian Reid, area manager for
Big Beat, the company that owns the club, ``is that we don't want to get in the
way of people having a good time. Michael Kilkie will be the DJ on both
Christmas Eve and Hogmanay. There won't be a single bit of tinsel in the place
but we'll be painting a Christmas scene with the decor.''
Decor is at least one area where clubs can confidently add festivity without
infringing upon musical expectations. The rest is left to the natural evolution
of atmosphere provided (or not) by the club's clientele; the good time
hopefully being had by all.
If Christmas Eve and Hogmanay are precarious nights for clubbers, at other
times in the Christmas/New Year season clubbers needs are quite nicely
saturated. Sly is a student night at The Tunnel on December 26 with an
excellent reputation for delivering seasonal kitsch alongside necessary sounds.
Edinburgh's infamous techno extravaganza Pure has another one-night-stand at
The Barrowlands on December 30, and on the same night the illustrious Cream
promoters take up The Arches and make the space their own. Also at The Arches
on Boxing Day, the great John Digweed is the guest of Streetrave, with CJ
Macintosh in support.
The message seems to be that if serious clubbers want to be certain of a good
time then they should take advantage of the whole festive season rather than
relying on the Eves - Christmas or New Year.
To cut a long dress into a short party frock, Christmas Eve and Hogmanay
clubbing is, for the devotional clubber, a growing phenomenon in search of a
tradition, treading the thin hem-line between club-preciousness and
clubbers'-seasonal exuberance. But it's all surely set to change as clubbers
learn to take themselves less seriously, and promoters gain a sense of humour
as well as a scent for cash.
In the meantime, a new food should perhaps be added to the traditional seasonal
fare of turkey, mince pies and cranberry sauce - cheese, spread on thickly and
dressed in a tacky mini and a Santa Claus hat. After all, at this time of the
year, there's so much of it about.

TOO few prison officers at Holloway. Too few nurses at the Royal Edinburgh
Hospital. Overcrowded classrooms in schools. Youngsters begging on the streets.
Stress at work at a worrying level. Unemployment rising again. Millions turning
to gambling on the National Lottery.
This may be the recipe for economic success, but whatever happened to human
happiness?
Elspeth Porter,
116 Danes Drives, Glasgow.
IN the age where the breakdown of civilised behaviour seems to be accelerating,
and governments are feebly reacting to events instead of shaping them, is it
any wonder that hitherto decent and law-abiding people are becoming fearful for
the future for themselves and their families?
There is no-one I know, regardless of age, who envisages a brighter future for
the generations to come. The tragedy of such thinking is that it is
self-fulfilling and can only serve to encourage many to grab what they can for
themselves in an increasingly hostile attitude to authority.
Sadly, for most of us, selfishness and greed seem to be endemic in the highest
echelons of our institutions, with the result that contempt for authority is
universally felt if not openly displayed.
I feel especially sorry for our police forces who are in the front line between
the disillusioned, disenfranchised, and dispirited sections of our community
and an increasingly insular Government.
Is it any wonder that extreme nationalism and fascism are on the march once
more?
As a Scot, I feel that we as a nation might yet set an example of tolerance and
fair play that other nations will recognise and emulate.
In the present political quagmire, however, this would only come about through
the installation of a national democratic Government with attendant powers to
harness the indigenous and still potent force of a people whose sense of
justice is historically proven.

IN his article (Judges who can do the country a large favour, December 15) on
the Save Our Railways action against privatisation, Brian Wilson cites John
Major's ``I will tell the Rt Hon Gentleman that what is rising is investment in
the railways and the standards of service to the passengers''.
He also told the nation at large in 1992 that there would be no increase in
taxes. Not a lie, of course, merely a prophecy and promise bedevilled by
``events'' - or ``life'', as some people call it.
It would seem that if the population, if not the world, at large would stand
still and do nothing, the Government's promises could be realised. It's all
those nasty ``events''. By the same token, of course, supposing that what Mr
Major says is true, the rises in ``investment in the railways and the standards
of service'' are also ``events'' and in no way the outcome of Government
policies.
Or have we all got it wrong in this pantomime season? Is John Major the Good
Fairy and are the Tories Guardian Angels, with malevolent Unemployed,
Foreigners, Criminals, Single Parents, Schoolchildren With Knives, and other
forces of evil bringing about``events'' that thwart Unalloyed Good (or Tory
policy, as it is called)?
What if the Conservative Party stood still (or went into Whipping-boy
Opposition) for a decade or two and let the rest of the Creation get a look in?

<TEXT>
COUNCIL rents in Aberdeen could rise by #6 a week as a result of new financial
controls imposed by the Government unless current investment in the housing
stock was reduced, it was warned yesterday.
Councillor Ramsay Milne, housing convener of Aberdeen District Council and the
new Aberdeen City Council, condemned the Scottish Office decision which will
see an #8m cut in the authority's housing capital spending budget.
Under the new rules, which take effect from April 1, councils will be forced to
use 25% of their capital receipts for the repayment of debt.
``This means we are not only having to cope with a lower figure from last year
but that we will only be able to use 75% of it on our stock,'' he said.
He attacked the Government for ``blatantly massaging the figures to make them
look better''.
Mr Milne said the Scottish Office figures were based on an estimated sale of
821 council homes while the council's statistics showed the number would be
around 700, leaving a discrepancy of over #2.65 million.
Aberdeen council rents for the next financial year will be fixed in February.

A GAMEKEEPER, sacked after being accused of salmon poaching, yesterday said he
would not have put his job on the line by doing something so silly.
Mr Andrew Thomson, 31, from Invergarry, also insisted there was no hook on the
line when he was surprised on the bank of the River Garry in Inverness-shire by
the new laird.
Mr Thomson, originally from the Glasgow area, claimed at an industrial tribunal
in Inverness that he was only ``test casting'' a new rod he had taken on
approval from an angling shop in Inverness. There was a fly on the line but no
hook. He eventually bought the rod.
He said new laird Paul Williamson, 30, from Norfolk, did not come close enough
or touch the line to see if there was a hook on it. Mr Thomson agreed he was
going through the same motions as someone angling.
The bailiff said he was ``devastated'' when, three months later, his bosses,
the Ness District Fishery Board, accused him of fishing illegally and dismissed
him.
The tribunal will give its decision later on the unfair dismissal case.

THE results of a review of the Scottish Avalanche Information Service announced
earlier this year by the Scottish Office are not likely to be published until
May next year, it was confirmed yesterday.
Concern has been expressed in some quarters that the service, established in
1988, has not been extended beyond the mountain areas of Lochaber, Glencoe, and
the northern Cairngorms.
Eleven of the 23 victims of avalanches in the past seven years have been in
areas that are not covered, such as Torridon in Wester Ross, Lochnagar on
Deeside, and Creag Meggaidh in the Loch Laggan area.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth decided to commission a review costing #5500
to look at the service in view of the 12 deaths which occurred in avalanches
last winter.
A review group, whose members include representatives from the Mountaineering
Committee of Scotland and the British Mountaineering Council, will report to Mr
Forsyth next May after gleaning expert advice from mountaineers on the most
effective way of providing the service.
Mr Forsyth stressed yesterday that the review, carried out under the auspices
of the Scottish Sports Council, was concerned with getting expert advice on the
most effective way of providing an avalanche information service.
Mr Hamish MacInnes, an international consultant on mountain rescue, who was
instrumental in establishing the avalanche service in Scotland, said last
night: ``The service is very important to Scotland because of the greater
emphasis these days on outdoor activities.
``It is every bit as vital as daily weather forecasts and badly needs expanding
to take in more areas than it covers at present. Hopefully, the review may lead
to this.''

<HEADLINE>Ten-year sentence for screwdriver attack</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974766144</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PERSISTENT offender who stabbed a man with a screwdriver, endangering his
life, was jailed for 10 years yesterday at the High Court in Glasgow.
The court had heard how 23-year-old Frank Carroll had stabbed Mr Stewart
McFadyen, a worker in a surgical appliance business, after an attempted robbery
at Templeton Business Centre in the city's east end on August 31.
Carroll, of Whitevale Street in Camlachie, was charged with the attempted
murder of Mr McFadyen, who had suspected him of robbery and accosted him in a
lift. Carroll had attempted to break into a parked car.
The screwdriver had pierced one of the two main arteries of Mr McFadyen's heart.
During the two-day trial, surgeons told Mr Iain Bonomy QC, prosecuting, that
when Mr McFadyen arrived at the city's Royal Infirmary he was on the point of
death.
Blood pumping from his pulmonary artery was filling up the heart sac to the
point where it was so enlarged it was ready to stop beating.
Doctors just had 10 minutes to find out what was wrong with Mr McFadyen and
save his life.
In the desperate race against the clock, surgeons opened up his chest, released
the blood from his heart, looked for the injury, and made repairs.
Mr Bonomy revealed that Carroll, a persistent housebreaker and car thief, had
four convictions for resisting arrest where police were involved.
At the time of the offence, Carroll was doing 125 hours community service at
the Templeton Business Centre after a conviction at Airdrie Sheriff Court in
October 1994.
He was also out on licence after serving half of a six-month sentence for car
theft.
Jailing him for 10 years, Lord Gill told him: ``Your record establishes that
you have been a persistent criminal since you were 18.
``With this conviction, you have moved into a much graver category of crime.
``The medical brilliance of doctors saved you from a life sentence today. This
was a very grave crime.''
Lord Gill ordered that Carroll finishes the other half of his six-month
sentence before starting the new one.
Following the sentence, Mr McFadyen commented on his ``have-a-go-hero'' status.
He said: ``I was standing looking out of a window overlooking the car park when
I saw this guy break into a workmate's car and then head towards the building.
``I ran down the stairs and grabbed him by the arm. I told him that I'd just
seen him breaking into a car but he denied it.
``The next thing I marched him to the lift and put him inside.
Mr McFadyen added that if in such a situation again, he would call the police.
``And that's what I would advise anyone else to do who finds himself in a
similar situation. It's not worth risking your life for.''

THE brother of pop star Boy George was committed yesterday to a secure mental
hospital for an indefinite period for the manslaughter of his wife.
St Albans Crown Court was told that Gerald O'Dowd, 32, was a paranoid
schizophrenic who was suffering from delusions when he stabbed his wife Gillian.
Mr Graham Parkins QC, prosecuting, said the 32-year-old was ``almost certainly
resting'' when she was stabbed once in the heart at home in Tring,
Hertfordshire, in September.
Psychiatrists told the court O'Dowd had been suffering from a severe mental
illness.
After stabbing Gillian, he drove to Tring police station and placed a knife on
the bonnet of a police car outside, Mr Parkin said.
He told two officers: ``I think you'd better take this. I think I have killed
my wife.''
O'Dowd had pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the
grounds of diminished responsibility.
Mr Adrian Redgrave, QC, for the defence, said his client had no recollection of
the killing and was shocked and grieved by Gillian's death.

I WOULD like to thank you for the article in Weekend Extra on November 4 about
La Quetzal in Guatemala. I am pleased to continue buying your paper knowing
that you have a commitment to reporting the truth about our world and that you
have given people an opportunity to do some good, via the Scottish Catholic
International Aid Fund, for the people of La Quetzal.
I have been a SCIAF supporter for many years and normally at this time send a
donation to it in lieu of Christmas presents to my mum and dad and my sister
and her husband. This year's donation goes to La Quetzal and I have photocopied
your article to let them see who they are benefiting.
Perhaps next year you could feature a similar article and suggest that people
donate to a project instead of buying presents for people who don't need them?
One of the best presents I ever had was when I opened a card from my sister
which said: ``A donation has been made in your name to buy food for a year for
a street child in Guatemala''. It still brings tears to my eyes when I think of
it.
Over the past fortnight, since the beginning of December, my two sons and I
have been suffering from flu. It occurred to me during this time how fortunate
we are to live in a comfortable, centrally-heated house and not to have to
worry about the electricity bills when I am constantly washing and drying
sheets because the boys have been fevered and sweating.
And of course we have ready access to a doctor. My boys have asthma so we never
have trouble asking for a doctor and our GPs are excellent.
My younger son, who is 12, has been in and out of hospital since he was three,
and I have always been aware how much harder it is to be sick when you are also
poor. This is as true for the people here at home as it is for the people of La
Quetzal. What an unjust world!

THE scene is One Devonshire Gardens, the frightfully upmarket Glasgow hotel,
where Hamilton and Inches, the frightfully upmarket jewellers are having a wee
do. The idea is to sell some of their frightfully expensive baubles to a
discerning West End of Glasgow public who were warmed up for the purpose by
being served a little wine and a few canapes.
A lady journalist has been invited along to this glittering event and, after
being on her feet for some time, she parks her backside on one of the hotel's
frightfully upmarket armchairs. A waitress offers her a canape at which she
duly begins to gnaw.
At this point a frightfully upmarket lady from Hamilton and Inches approaches
and asks her to stand up. ``Why?'' she asks, not unreasonably. ``This is a
cocktail party,'' the H&amp;I lady hisses. ``One doesn't sit down at cocktail
parties.'' At least, now we know.
Taking the fizz
WE are indebted to Glasgow Guzzler, the organ of the West of Scotland branch of
the Campaign for Real Ale, for an unusual recipe for a home-made brew.
It reports how a chap called Bruce Williams, whose brewery produces Heather
Ale, gave a demonstration of how to make an instant creamy beer of the type now
favoured by so many drinkers: ``He took a half-pint glass of soda water, gave
the liquid a beer-like caramel colour by squeezing out a damp tea-bag, then
added to it some propylene glycol and isomerised hop extract.
``Then he gave it a thick creamy head by blasting some nitrous oxide into it.
The end product looked, smelled, and even tasted like a half-pint of beer, even
though two minutes earlier it had just been a glass of soda water.''
The recipe is not a recommendation from the Camra people as to what we should
be supping this festive season. It is yet another attack on the big brewers
who, they claim, ``are flooding the market with keg beers which use a mixture
of nitrogen and carbon dioxide to make the beers a bit less fizzy while
appearing to be a real ale''.
Mr Williams described his instant beer as a ``brewery formulated cocktail''. It
sounds more like a Blue Peter ale, with shades of John Noakes saying: ``And
here's one I made earlier''.
Ups and downs
WE are also indebted to The Absolute Game (OK, we admit that this ``indebted''
bit is another way of saying we are about to plagiarise shamelessly from the
aforesaid publication) for an update on the trials and tribulations of Hamilton
Accies FC.
The club is anchored, as they say, at the foot of the first division and are
homeless since Douglas Park was reduced to rubble in readiness for the
contruction of a Sainsbury's supermarket.
Repeated promises of a spanking new stadium in which to build a bright new
future appear to have fallen on sceptical ears. The TAG mag reports Willie
McInally, the Accies supporters club bus convener, as saying: ``I suppose we'll
believe it when we see the first brick being laid.''
He is backed up by Colin Mitchell, editor of HASH, the club fanzine, who says:
``We will not believe it until we are sitting in it.'' More realistic is the
anonymous fan, who asserts: ``I will not believe it until I am sitting
depressed in it.''
Sound and fury
NOW that the Diary is on the Internet, we get many messages from far-flung
parts, some of which are not far-flung enough. But we liked this possibly
apocryphal tale from Toronto. It concerns the local minister who pulled up
behind a car stopped at the lights and noticed that it boasted a bumper sticker
saying ``Honk if You Love Jesus''. He duly honked, only to have the occupant of
the front car leap out and approach him shouting, ``Can't you see the f*******
lights are red?''
Strip torn off
FERGUS McCann is at a social function and is in buoyant mood, given Celtic's
recent run of good results. ``What would you say if I told you that I had #20m
here to complete the rebuilding of Celtic Park?'' he asks, patting the
left-hand pocket of his jacket. ``And what would you say if I had another #15m
here to buy players?'' he asks patting the right-hand pocket.
``I'd say you were wearing David Murray's jacket,'' replies one of the
assembled company.
The end is nigh
AND so we reach the final chapter of our quest to find the perfect fourth Wise
Man to visit the stable in Bethlehem.
John Quinn of Lenzie wins a Langs whisky first-footing kit for his nomination
of Rab C Nesbitt saying ``Err merr myrrh - fae me an Mary, Mary.''
Norrie Stevenson of Doonfot, Ayr, wins a bottle of Langs Supreme whisky for one
of the worst puns in living memory. Norrie suggests that Humphrey Errington
would turn up with a lump of Lanarkshire Blue, courtesy of his new company
Cheeses of Nazareth.
Andy Murray receives a bolt of lightning for suggesting that Glasgow City
Council have decided to up the security at their George Square nativity scene
by nailing the Baby Jesus to the crib.
There's still time
LAST-MINUTE shoppers still have time to get along to the Lobey Dosser gift shop
which has newly opened at the Halt Bar in Woodlands Road, Glasgow, right
opposite That Statue. Umbrellas, T-shirts, pens, ties, and jigsaws all bearing
the Dosser Industries imprint are available. Part of the profits go to
maintaining the world-famous equestrian statue which recently, we have to
report, suffered a severe fetlock injury requiring the attention of men with
soldering equipment.
The injury was sustained by big boys jumping on the back of the wee horse. They
also broke El Fideldo's reins. All has been put right now and the statue even
has a new coat of patina for its Christmas.

MORE years ago than I care to remember, I carried out an investigation for the
late-lamented Sunday Standard into the size of the public-sector carrot
assembled to persuade Roche, the tight-lipped Swiss-based pharmaceutical
multinational, to build a vitamin C production plant at its existing vitamin B1
and B5 facility at Dalry in Ayrshire.
The carrot was stoutly rooted in deep soil, but eventually, after some serious
digging, I came up with an estimated cost, to your purse and mine, of each new
job. An astonishing #350,000. Between them, the Scottish Office and Strathclyde
region were contributing #70m in grants and infrastructure costs to a project
with a total price tag of #162m. All to create 200 new jobs.
When the story appeared, Roche senior management in the UK got very agitated. A
top team flew to Glasgow to confront me. We sat down - the simmering tensions
ruffling the tablecloth - for a lunch where I fully expected to be the main
course. Instead, they spent most of the meal interrogating me on who had fed me
my evidence.
In their innocence, the Roche execs did not know that case-by-case details of
regional development grants, regional selective assistance, and other state
investment incentives were published, on a regular basis, by Government. The
trick was knowing where to look. There was a presumption, in their questioning,
that the state aid they were getting for the Dalry project should have been
kept a closed commercial secret.
Globetrotting companies and the governments keen to lure them and their jobs
are often anxious to play down the importance of hard cash in deciding between
this location or that. The quality of the local skills base, access to markets,
and a hundred and one other factors, they'll tell you, loom just as large in
the final decision.
But the truth is that the market for inward investment, like every other free
market, operates on a price mechanism. And, with upwards of 35 million people
unemployed across the European Union, this is most definitely a seller's
market. In all but exceptional cases, if a government doesn't put a big enough
carrot on the table, it won't be at the races when the final choice is made.
When the Chunghwa Picture Tube company of Taiwan was finalising plans recently
for its major new plant at Mossend in Lanarkshire - #260m investment, 3300
direct jobs promised - a last-minute snag emerged. No-one had told Chunghwa's
president that the Government assistance package he was already promised - #80m
plus or #24,000 a job, 'tis said - was taxable.
``Get me the Irish on the phone,'' came the aggrieved instruction, as the
Scottish team scrambled to raid the Lanarkshire Development Agency's
accumulated budget surplus and tweak the package just enough to soothe fevered
oriental brows and secure the biggest single investment ever attracted to these
shores.
A few weeks ago the Irish looked like having the last laugh on another major
investment Lanarkshire would love to get its hands on. Nokia, the Finnish group
best known for its mobile telecoms business, is contemplating building a #26m
plant making base stations and employing up to 700 people. If it comes to
Scotland it will locate in the new Hamilton International site between Blantyre
and East Kilbride.
Sources close to the haggling were gloomily reporting that the Irish were
prepared to offer #18m in grants, while the best Scotland could do was #11m.
But Nokia may be one of those exceptions where money isn't everything. The
latest indications are that the battle may now be between Scotland and Germany.
But, with Nokia's share price sliding recently, the final decision has been
pushed back into next year.
If you set yourself up - in Michael Heseltine's well-worn phrase - as the
enterprise centre of Europe, out to attract as much footloose capital as you
can to replace declining indigenous industries, there is a serious price to be
paid. As yesterday's HCI hospital report from the Public Accounts Committee
reminds us, public money put into such ventures is, at the end of the day, risk
money. You may get your jobs. But, if you don't, there is no guarantee that
you'll get your money back either.
The Scottish Office argued, in evidence to the committee, that the #18.6m in
selective assistance paid to HCI has not been ``lost'', since the completed
Clydebank hospital is there for anyone to see, albeit now operated by the Abu
Dhabi Investment Company and not the original start-up company. What was lost
was Scottish Enterprise's #5.4m package of loans and equity, together with #3m
of associated interest.
Scottish Enterprise was saying very little yesterday. But it might reasonably
have argued that, while it took a bath on HCI, it has returned multi-million
pound gains to the Treasury on a whole series of other risk-equity investments,
from Inveresk Research, Dunclair Dispensers, and Stagecoach to Calluna, Exacta,
and Spider Systems. The sale of Spider to American interests alone generated a
gain of some #7m on SE's original stake, almost enough to offset the HCI
liability, at a stroke.
There is a debate to be had - and the PAC seems keen to have it - about why
more wasn't done earlier by publicly accountable officials to track the warning
signs that HCI, as originally conceived, would turn out to be a turkey. But
risk investment is about both shooting stars and turkeys. You win some. But,
sure as eggs is eggs, you lose some too.
The real debate, surely, is about whether the state has any place in backing
risky or footloose ventures with our money. But most politicians don't seem to
want that debate. Perhaps that's because, through the eighties and into the
nineties, luring inward investment to these shores was all that stood between
us and having no industrial strategy worthy of the name. Pouring millions into
everything from Roche to Chunghwa served an important political objective. It
kept the dole queues shorter than they might otherwise have been.
There is a danger in focusing, as the PAC has done in the HCI case, on why the
turkeys aren't spotted earlier. If that's what really matters, public officials
will become more and more risk averse. In that mood, they will miss a lot of
the shooting stars too.

PUBLIC utterances of the royal couple have traced the state of their
relationship over 14 years: early radiance degenerating into public feuding.
In an interview on the announcement of their engagement, Charles said he was
``positively delighted and frankly amazed that Diana is prepared to take me
on''.
The then Lady Diana appeared unable to conceal her happiness too. ``I am
absolutely delighted; thrilled; blissfully happy.''
On the eve of their 1981 marriage, the royal couple already appeared to have
thought out possible pitfalls likely to afflict the relationship.
The prince said he was confident Diana would ``develop her own sphere'', with
family and outside interests of her own.
As rumours mounted that she was bored with Charles's polo playing, the prince
blasted reports as ``absolute rubbish. It's not much fun watching polo when
you're being surrounded by people with very long lenses poking from all
directions at you for the entire time, taking photographs, which it's quite
easy to do, and saying you are bored.''
In 1984, in a rare American television interview, Diana spoke of the couple's
joy at becoming parents for the second time.
She said: ``It's interesting with a second child . . . you're more relaxed as
parents, I think, and therefore able to communicate an atmosphere of greater
relaxation to the child.''
In 1985, during an ITN interview they were asked about apparent public rows
while on holiday skiing. Charles defended his wife. ``I suspect that most
husbands and wives find they often have arguments.'' Immediately, Diana
corrected: ``But we don't.''
In 1986, an ITN documentary called In Person, In Private, featured a romantic
behind the scenes look at the royal couple's life. In one scene Diana's
excitement surfaced when she asked a lady-in-waiting: ``Will my hubby be down
from Scotland then 'cos I'd quite like to go with him?''
In 1992, shortly after publication of Andrew Morton's book Diana: Her True
Story, the couple separated. Embarrassing revelations followed.
In 1994, the gloves were well and truly off.
In Jonathan Dimbleby's ITV documentary Charles, The Private Man, The Public
Role, the prince told 20 million viewers of his relationship with Mrs Camilla
Parker Bowles. He said he had been faithful to Diana ``until it became
irretrievably broken down.''
The princess then admitted on Panorama she too had been unfaithful. She said of
Captain James Hewitt: ``I adored him. I was in love with him.''
Of Charles she said: ``My wish is that my husband finds peace of mind, and from
that follows other things.''

THE Queen's intervention in the warring Wales marriage met a mixed reaction in
a straw poll on the streets of Glasgow.
Some said she should not have interfered in such a public manner - but others
said she was right.
Others were not bothered by the prospect of a divorced king.
Ms Geraldine O'Rourke, 31, of Maryhill, said: ``She's interfering and its none
of her business.
``It has now got too public and they should have been left to sort themselves
out in private.''
Mr Brian Cormbie, 54, who lives in the west end of Glasgow said: ``She was
right to do it - after all, Charles and Diana had not managed to sort it out
themselves.''
Ms Freda Leighton, of Newton Mearns, said: ``She is not interfering. Sometimes
you have to put your children right. It was all getting too public and it's
time they both were stopped.''

BRITAIN is not a nation of Miss Worlds, bovinely demanding peace, happiness and
goodwill. One of the rights of living in a materialist democracy is being able
to buy what you want and when, and customers all over Europe feel this very
strongly. In the argument as to whether alcohol could be sold on a Sunday in
Scotland, the church lost, consumerism won.
No-one wants to be Scrooge. Fewer citizens, however, now attend any religious
service. The mood is not cynical, consumerism is not the new god, but evidently
few want to conform. While the ideals of joy and compassion still stand proud
and true, there is a major disagreement among the public as to how this
goodwill should manifest itself. The Christmas Tree personifies this combat
between tradition and evolution. Few people, regardless of personal moral
values, are prepared to live with alien decor.
The modern philosophy is that individuality can be forged by what you choose to
buy. One of the easiest ways of expressing self is to be singular about
upsetting the rules. But there is spontaneity, and there is premeditated
commercial nous. The designer responsible for the current non-conformist cheer
of Princes Square, Glasgow, is Malcolm Lochhead, a Lecturer in Design at
Glasgow Caledonian University. He was commissioned by a company called Flying
Colours (Enterprises) Ltd, who produced the heraldry for the Edinburgh Tattoo.
In his opinion, unconventional design can replace any fairy tale. ``Princes
Square is a shopping centre for grown-ups. I wanted the shapes to echo the
architecture.''
The semi-circles of netting above the Food Court hold two and a half thousand
lights. ``At night they look like the night sky.'' This is a personal
interpretation of adult magic, without regression, without the regurgitation of
childhood associations, for, with the right to buy comes snobbery. Evergreens
measled with small, white sparkling lights are trendy. Pine trees with acorns,
gold balls and crimson bows are traditional and safe. A bonsai fir saturated
with fake snow is fun. But those who believe themselves to be ahead of fashion
are convinced that the Christmas tree should blend in with its environment. But
this is a naff compulsion, too close to the idea of buying a painting to match
the living room suite.
It could be the exhumation of stress, that this article is witnessing, via the
camp and careful consideration of colour schemes. ``My tree has a huge bow at
the top,'' says Malcolm Lochhead. ``It's shocking pink with butterflies,
against a pink, silver and gold background.'' And this from the man, who, when
dispensing tree-dressing advice, told me to ``keep it simple''.
But there is a clear and strong demand for Christmas decorations which provide
a means of escaping the yawnerooing ``boredom'' of fat Santa. Condomania in New
York, have allegedly decorated their tree with differently coloured condoms.
And Habitat, the vanguard of good, bourgeois taste, have taken a stand against
the curse of Christmas Tree decoration.
``Habitat have never sold tinsel, never will, and we keep garlands to a
minimum,'' states Manager Susan McEwan.
Hingy things have no place in the homes of the artistically aware. Good
decorations don't droop, like the best of breasts they keep their shape. ``If
we think we are conforming to tradition we change direction. We decide on a
theme each year, last Christmas we used what we call naturals, this year we've
used brights; pinks, oranges, blues and yellows on bright baubles and glass.''
So confident are the public in their own integrity and values, that they don't
want to pollute their domestic territory with vulgar, festive frills anymore.
Habitat are 140% up on their decoration sales last year. The Christmas climate
is changing. The supporting symbols of Christianity, such as angels and
berries, are no longer needed.

n.SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth is being urged to leap into action in the
new year to save cities from a ``black plague'' of rubbish bags.
Laws designed to punish householders who dump refuse on the street outside
normal collecting hours have been rubbished by procurators fiscal who are
refusing to take suspects to court.
Recent environmental legislation empowered council officials to impose #10
fixed penalties on persistent offenders - traced through discarded envelopes -
with the threat of heavier fines at the Sheriff Court for defaulters.
But legal experts question whether convictions can be secured without positive
identification of actual offenders, and short-staffed councils can't afford
surveillance operations.
``If a householder blames someone else - a lodger or relative - there's little
we can do about it,'' a senior refuse manager told Check-Out. ``It's become a
dumper's charter.''
In Edinburgh the #10 penalty is now regarded as a ``hollow threat'', although
suspected dumpers are told it can be imposed. ``It's become a matter of
persuasion rather than enforcement,'' said an official. ``In the interests of
health and the environment the matter must be sorted soon.''
n.WHEN a reformed Scrooge marvelled at the prize turkey presented to the
Cratchits - ``that bird never could have stood upon his legs ..... he would
have snapped 'em off like sticks of sealing wax'' - he could easily be
describing today's factory-bred successor.
At least in Dickens' day the hapless creature had only itself to blame for
obesity: the supermarket variety most Scots will be scoffing this Christmas has
little choice, according to animal rights campaigners, Viva!
Sentenced to a brief and painful existence in cramped sheds that restrict
exercise to add extra pounds, turkeys become so top-heavy their bones snap
under their own weight, trapping them in the excreta that's accumulated over
months of captivity.
Ulcerated feet, beaks sliced off with red-hot blades, osteoporosis and heart
failure, with only salmonella to avenge you after your throat's been slit .....
God bless them every one!
n.MARKING the seventh anniversary of the Lockerbie air disaster, pressure group
Disaster Action, is urging public support for a Private Member's Bill proposing
new offences of ``corporate recklessness'' and negligence.
Writing in the influential Consumer Policy Review, published by the Consumers'
Association, spokeswoman Pamela Dix estimates more than 1000 people have died
in non-natural disasters, like the destruction of PanAm 103, over the last 30
years.
Official criticism seldom results in those who could have prevented deaths
being made accountable so prosecutions are rare, says Ms Dix, condemning
``corporate violence''.
Disaster Action wants this treated like ordinary crime with new definitions of
culpability and sanctions like corporate probation to encourage higher safety
standards.
n.AN acute dilemma is facing Princess Anne following Check-Out's disclosure
that Save The Children had aligned itself with the Robertson's golliwog on jars
of Christmas mincemeat.
Among those condemning the unlikely alliance is Prince Pius Nyiam, a Nigerian
leader of Edinburgh's ethnic community, who intends to complain to HRH. She
must decide whether to offend a fellow royal by ignoring the protest, or put
the cat among the pigeons at the London-based charity with a presidential
rebuke.
Not known for mincing her words, will the Princess be giving someone a
dressing-down for this public relations gaffe? You may think that, but we
couldn't possibly comment, was the gist of Buckingham Palace's reply.

A SHERIFF yesterday accepted medical evidence that no treatment would have
saved the life of ex-docker John Ross, 86, a patient who lay for 30 hours
unconscious in a lavatory in a doctor's surgery in Fife because of a failure to
check them.
The elderly man went missing on August 1 after going to Muiredge Surgery at
Buckhaven in Fife to collect a repeat prescription for his 83-year-old wife
Mary. Despite a police search, he was not found until surgery staff checked the
toilet the following night.
He died eight days later without regaining consciousness and the two-day
inquiry at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court heard medical evidence that prior to his
collapse he was ``living on a knife edge'' and could have died at any time.
Referring to the fact that a receptionist and cleaner failed to make earlier
checks of the toilets, Sheriff Gail Patrick said: ``Naturally it is of
considerable distress and anguish to Mr Ross's family that he was denied both
treatment and the comfort of professional nursing care immediately after his
collapse.''
She added: ``The evidence of doctors, however, was that for Mr Ross (a
remarkable gentleman, uncomplaining in spite of serious illness) there would
have been no difference to the outcome had he been discovered immediately, as
neither of his life-threatening illnesses could have been successfully
treated.''
In the light of that, she said, it would be inappropriate to make any findings
other than a formal verdict that Mr Ross of Sea Road, Methil, died at 2.30pm on
August 9 at Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy, as a result of a blood clot on the
lung and a massive stroke.
Stating that the inquiry had disclosed a ``tragic combination of
circumstances'' which resulted in Mr Ross lying unconscious and undiscovered
for 30 hours in the surgery's disabled toilet cubicle, the sheriff endorsed a
new checking and security code sent by Fife Health Board to all GP surgeries
following the incident.
Mr Ross's son Jackie declined to comment on the findings and referred inquiries
to the family's lawyer, Mr David Ritchie, who said on their behalf: ``The
family is very pleased that a full canvassing of all the issues involved was
carried out at the fatal accident inquiry.''
He added: ``I am of the view that the family's options are still open following
the sheriff's decision and they are taking stock of the situation over the next
few weeks before deciding what, if any, action to take.''
Yesterday, at the surgery - which has tightened up checking procedures, the
inquiry was told - a spokesman said: ``The practice appreciates the thorough
investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mr Ross. We are content
with the determination of the sheriff and have no further comment.''
Fife Health Board's director of primary care, Dr Gavin McBurnie, said:
``Following this incident, we ordered an immediate investigation. In the light
of the findings, we advised every medical practice in Fife of strict new
checking and security procedures which should be adhered to."

CLYDESDALE District Council is a bad loser. Having squandered #350,000 of
public money on its inept harassment of the Lanark Blue cheesemaker Humphrey
Errington, it has finally decided to leave him in penurious peace; but not
before telling the world it knows best. Cheese Wrong, Council Right - despite
four court hearings, an exhaustive scientific investigation, and a judicial
verdict which liberated the suspect cheeses and vindicated their maker.
Lanark Blue, meanwhile, has become a big cheese among small food producers, the
Che Guevara of their heroic struggle against the hegemony of mass production
and the tyranny of bulk buying. We can expect tee-shirts soon: In the Pink with
Lanark Blue, or suchlike slogans. Humphrey Errington's imaginative enterprise
at Dunsyre has been cheered on, too, by consumers - not only those who enjoy
his cheese but those who instinctively value the qualities which specialist
food producers bring to the market-place.
There are any number of vacuum-packed, orange-tinted so-called Cheddars on the
supermarket shelves. There is only one authentic Roquefort, or Gorgonzola, or
Lanark Blue, and Humphrey Errington intends to protect its distinction. His
cause celebre and the successful outcome have brought the kind of publicity he
couldn't buy; some compensation, you might think, for the #120,000 spent
defending his cheese.
But there is no return on the marketing side effects of this undesirable
investment. I had a telephone conversation with Mr Errington recently, and
asked him if sales of Lanark Blue had benefited from the public interest and
general sympathy the case attracted. ``No,'' he said, ``because we sell all we
make anyway, and I can't increase production without increasing our flock of
400 ewes, which I'm certainly not in a position to do at the moment.''
And he added, ``I could make more cheese by buying in supplies of frozen milk
from other sheep. But I'm producing a cheese called Lanark Blue, which gets its
name and its character from the milk of sheep which graze on the South
Lanarkshire hills. If I made it any other way it would be a different product.''
There speaks a food craftsman, and I wish there were more like him. How, for
example, has the famous name of Cheddar come to be represented in the popular
imagination by a peculiarly nasty shade of orange, the colour of something
which might be used to treat a fungal skin condition? My husband, who knows the
way to my heart is through my stomach, once brought me an authentic huckle of
Cheddar cheese from its home gorge; the texture of its moist crumbs and the
subtle strength of its flavour caused me to forswear forever the waxy wedges of
the supermarket shelves, dyed or undyed.
Something good does, occasionally, come out of the EC, so often the enemy of
traditional foods. (An EC directive on listeria in dairy products compounded
Lanark Blue's troubles, although it wasn't in force when Clydesdale seized the
cheeses.
In fact, the directive contains a derogation which, if used, waives the
listeria standards for specialist cheesemakers, but it was only the Lanark Blue
case which encouraged MAFF officials, prompted by Humphrey Errington's
supporters, to apply for the derogation for British cheeses.) The EC has also
become the guardian of the gastronomic pedigree.
I'm not much of a sherry drinker, but I applauded the news that as from January
the sickly beverages called British, Irish, and Cyprus sherry cease to exist.
There is only one country which produces decent fino and amontillado, albeit
with the historic co-operation of British families, and that's Spain. From the
beginning of 1996 only fortified wine produced in the region of Jerez de la
Frontera will be allowed to call itself sherry.
Which is as it should be. If you pronounce the name Jerez like a
French-speaker, rather than a Spanish one, you discover how the libation of the
suburban tippler came to be christened, and if you ever visit the bodegas of
this civilised corner of Andalucia you glimpse something of traditions which
can't be imitated. The wines of Jerez de la Frontera go with fine horses and
fighting bulls, as whisky goes with king salmon and royal stags. If it weren't
for the EC we might find Jameson calling their whiskey Scotch.
Its directives unfortunately don't extend to America, otherwise the great
champagne houses of Pol Roger and Bollinger might rest more easily in their
foundations. I once had a bad experience on a cruise ship which, although
British, sailed the Caribbean with a cargo of US citizens. As we left the
embarkation port of Fort Lauderdale the cruise director stood on deck and
shouted ``Bon Voyage'' to the spectators on the quay, just like Sam Goldwyn.
Such phoniness should have served as premonition.
At the poolside bar I picked up the drinks menu and looked at the prices.
``Wow! They're doing champagne at three dollars a glass!'' (In France the
average price of une coupe de champagne is 60 francs, over #7, and here you
might pay a fiver.) This thrilling discovery was followed by bitter
disappointment or, more accurately, sweet disappointment. The tepid pool of
sugary bubbles served in plastic beakers was not champagne, but one of the
lesser Californian fizzes. Anything that jumps about in a glass gets called
champagne in America, although the French producers have tried to outlaw the
practice.
There is craft in food and drink but they aren't works of art, which arguably
should remain in their country of origin, only to be exposed to the wider world
on touring exhibitions. Export helps the food industry, large and small, but it
carries the risk of hijack - the careless or cynical expropriation of
distinguished names, and the imperfect mimicry of production values which
should be unique.
As I walk round our cornucopian British supermarkets with their astonishing
range of produce, by no means all synthetic Cheddar and pot noodles, I feel
glad that the crop farmers of Zimbabwe and Mexico have found overseas markets
for their mange-touts and chilis; but I can't help regretting that foreign
travel holds few gastronomic surprises these days. There are few national
dishes or regional delicacies you won't find chill-cooked on the shelves of
Marks and Spencer.

AN Antarctic expedition has been abandoned because of the ``wrong type'' of
snow, it was announced yesterday.
A hi-tech sled being used by explorer Roger Mear in his solo unsupported
crossing of the Antarctic sank into snowdrifts and caused so much delay he had
to radio for help after 41 days on the ice.
The 45-year-old Derbyshire- based explorer admitted that the sled, which
carried his supplies for the 100-day walk across the sub-continent, and which
was propelled by a specially built kite, had not been tested in Antarctic
conditions. During the walk, which began on November 4, he experienced
temperatures of minus 34C and winds of 60 knots.
On his return to Britain yesterday, he commented: ``We had not tested in that
kind of ice and I had not experienced conditions like that before.
``What we had were two different types of snow. One, sustrugi, gets eroded by
wind and is very rough. On top of that, we had hoar which you get in still
areas.
``The sled kept sliding and sinking and I was losing time and wasting energy.
``I thought I could deal with the conditions and it was a real disappointment
but it was a rational decision.''
He had set out to race Norwegian Borge Ousland, a former commando, who began
the 1657-mile journey a week before him.
Mr Mear used a radio beacon to contact his expedition headquarters to send a
plane to pick him up on December 16 - after he had travelled less than 500
miles.
He used a special kite to help pull him and had hoped to set up 100-mile,
single-day journeys if the sled had worked properly.
``I was approaching an area with lots of crevassing and I didn't want to get
caught in that.
``I was in a vulnerable position in an area where winds reach up to 100mph. I
knew that if my tent was destroyed I couldn't survive for long.''

USING a mobile phone may ``cook'' your ear, a scientist warned yesterday.
According to Ole Svane, a senior physician in Denmark, the transmitter inside
the instrument generates an electromagnetic field similar to that of a
microwave oven.
In a Danish Government report into health and safety at work, Mr Svane says he
fears the phones may damage ears.
In an extract from the report, published in this month's National Association
of Health Authorities and Trusts health and safety newsletter, he reasons:
``You would never dream of sticking your head in a microwave oven.
``What happens to the delicate cartilage and bone of the ear when it is heated
time after time, in exactly the same way, as meat in a microwave oven?''
Mr Svane goes on to urge further research into the possibility of locating
nerve damage through mobile phone use.
However, a spokesman for mobile phone network operator Cellnet said: ``There
have been extensive tests on the effects of these electromagnetic fields and
none of the research has come up with evidence to suggest there are any ill
effects from using mobile phones.''

Missing patient inquiry prompts toilet checks

A SHERIFF yesterday accepted medical evidence that no treatment would have

THE dramatic effect of the Mexican peso crisis is well illustrated by the fact
that, even though Abtrust Emerging Economies Investment Trust's net asset value
was slashed by 18.6% to 82.87p in the year to end-September, the trust
significantly outperformed its benchmark index.
During the 12 months, Abtrust Emerging's benchmark International Finance
Corporation composite index tumbled 24.8%.
Abtrust Emerging suffered its worst losses in Latin America, as the shockwaves
from last December's peso crisis hit equity markets.
During the second half, its net asset value actually rose by 10.6%.
Abtrust Emerging, which last year paid a 0.20p Ordinary and 0.40p special
dividend, announced a 0.40p payout this time round, which it will at least
maintain in future years.
The #41m trust said, in spite of attractive valuations in Latin America and the
fact that stable and market-orientated governments had been in place for
several years in most countries, the ongoing strength of Wall Street continued
to divert funds away from the region.
It believes Brazil, Chile and Peru look attractive in terms of economic
fundamentals, and expects Argentina and Mexico to bounce back from the Latin
American financial crisis as interest rates fall.
Abtrust Emerging is invested in 22 countries, with 11.1% in Thailand, 10.6% in
Brazil, 9.1% in Indonesia, 7.5% in Malaysia, and 7.2% in Mexico.
Meanwhile, a poor showing by its substantial holdings in other investment
trusts' income shares saw Abtrust Preferred Income miss out on the recent
advances enjoyed by the UK stock market, writes ANDREW MULLINS.
Net asset value per Ordinary income share fell 4.2% to 86.38p during the six
months to end-November. The trust declared a second interim dividend of 3.25p,
for a half-year total of 6.5p.
Fund manager Paul Reed said the trust had performed well against a range of
internal benchmarks but declined to disclose what these were.
The remainder of the portfolio consists of Preference shares, bonds and
convertibles, which advanced with the UK stock market.
He is cautiously optimistic about the fund's immediate future and said he was
quite comfortable with the outlook for markets in the second half.

BRAND names are synonymous with the Vogue name, but at discounted prices. The
customer therefore has the confidence inspired by a recognised name of quality,
allied to competitive price tags.
Among the best known labels to be seen within the showroom are: Ercol, Stag,
Beaver &amp; Tapley, Nathan, Strongbow, Morris, Ducal, McIntosh, Wade, Cintique,
Duresta, Parker Knoll in furniture. In carpets, well respected names such as
Stoddard, Templeton, Mr Tomkinson, Kosset, Wilton Royal, Ulster, Brintons, are
just a few of the many ranges available. Similarly in the bed department in
hall three, where bedroom furniture ranges, are also displayed, you'll find
Rest Assured, Sealy, Slumberland, Silentnight and Relyon.
Here too, is where the custom-made curtain department is housed with an
excellent selection of fabrics from some of the leading manufacturers. Whatever
your ideas, for beautiful curtains and headings, this is where they can be
turned into practical possibilities. A home measuring service is available.
With around 120 three-piece suites on display at prices ranging from #699 to
#4000, more than 40 full dining ranges on view (wall units from #599 to #4500);
more than 26 full bedroom ranges displayed, and around 24 sofa bed styles to
see, customers' greatest difficulty will be making a choice.
There's lots of variety too in occasional pieces of furniture, with some really
interesting ideas such as handsome wooden topped tables with wrought iron
underframes; slender metal-framed pieces teamed with glass and canework, and
the unusual but effective looks of metal with verdigris finish.
``There used to be a tremendous difference between the European and American
markets, and the British and American tastes but they are all tending to
converge now,'' comments Robert Bremner.
He believes Vogue's new showroom is Glasgow's biggest furniture store, and, he
said: ``We believe in offering excellent customer service - while always being
pleased to allow people to browse in peace. We are fairly unique in the
furniture industry as far as independents go in that we have a fully
computerised system. We reckon that we are more efficient than anybody else in
Scotland because of it. The programme was written specifically for us and we've
had lots of people coming up from the South to look at it.''
Huge choice of quality products; branded names, often at significant discounts;
up to 36 months' interest-free credit - dependent upon the size of the order; a
promise that they won't be beaten on price; and customer care which extends
through delivery until the customer is fully satisfied with their products . .
. are the main reasons why Vogue considers itself the No.1 choice when it comes
to house furnishers.

<HEADLINE>Allianz sees higher profits but slowdown in premium growth</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S largest insurer, Allianz AG Holding, said yesterday it was on track
for higher earnings for 1995, although the strong mark and weak domestic
business had slowed its premium income growth this year.
The Munich-based insurance giant said premium income rose 5.1% in the first
nine months of 1995 and lower catastrophe claims and costs as well as the
downward trend in global interest rates had boosted earnings.
``In general one can expect a further improvement in total earnings in 1995 for
the entire Allianz group, barring any large claims such as from a natural
catastrophe, amid just slightly higher premium income growth,'' it said in a
statement.
Allianz said its underwriting earnings had improved significantly at home and
abroad in the first nine months of 1995 and non-underwriting earnings were
boosted by lower interest rates and higher stock prices worldwide.
The insurer reported group net profit of DM1340m (#604m) in 1994 and premium
income of DM66.1bn (#30bn).
Allianz said group premiums totalled DM52.2bn (#23.5bn) in the first nine
months of 1995, up from DM49.7bn (#22.4bn) a year earlier.
Income growth was curbed by strength in the mark. Consolidation of new
subsidiaries added DM4000m (#1801bn) to its premium income total.
``On a mark basis, the losses of key currencies against the mark were evident.
In original currencies, premium income rose 8.2%,'' Allianz said.
The insurer also said its German business was hurt by weak demand, while
premium income fell 41% in its North American life insurance business.
German insurers have been hit this year by a round of tax increases which have
cut consumers' disposable incomes.
``In Germany, growth in property and casualty insurance of barely 2% was the
result of clearly weaker new business. In life insurance also the number and
sums insured in new contracts were significantly reduced,'' the group said.
Allianz also said intensive competition led to muted premium income growth in
other European markets.
US life business was hit by weaker demand for pension funds, sending premiums
at Allianz Life of North America down 41% to DM2500m (#1126m).
However US property-casualty business rose 11%.
Allianz said its industrial and corporate business in the United States was
boosted by its Fireman's Fund unit's allocation of $800m to its reserves to
cover environmental legal costs claims. - Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Equitable wins bonus Dutch parent plans to invest further #325m in Edinburgh-based company to support its development</HEADLINE>

DUTCH insurance giant AEGON is completing its creeping takeover of Scottish
Equitable, the UK's largest provider of private pensions, with an
earlier-than-expected cash injection of #325m.
The money will be paid shortly into a fund that pays bonuses to Scottish
Equitable's with-profits policyholders.
The lump sum will compensate with-profits holders for letting AEGON take some
profits which they currently receive from other parts of the business.
AEGON first bought into Scottish Equitable in 1993, effectively ending its
status as a mutual company owned by policyholders.
An agreement signed two years ago provided for the Dutch insurer to take over
Scottish Equitable completely by the end of the century. But the final move
towards this goal has come sooner than expected.
``What we have done is thrive a little more quickly than we could have hoped
for,'' said Scottish Equitable marketing director Graham Dumble.
Funds managed by Scottish Equitable have grown about 13% over the last year to
more than #9500m.
The Edinburgh-based company started off in 1831 as a life assurance society,
but today 90% of its business consists of pension plans sold through
independent financial advisers (IFAs).
But over the past decade it has become increasingly focussed on pensions, which
now account for over 90% of its business. Two years ago AEGON paid #246m into
Scottish Equitable in a deal which transferred its staff and business to a new
company wholly owned by the Dutch insurer.
In return, AEGON gained the right to 40% of the profits from Scottish
Equitable's fast growing unit-linked business. Investors in unit-linked
products simply receive a return on the funds they invest. With-profits
policyholders also share in the profits of Scottish Equitable as a whole.
Last year AEGON ploughed a further #150m into Scottish Equitable to raise its
share of profits from the unit-linked business to 60%.
Now it will make a final #325m payment into the company's With-Profits Fund.
In return, AEGON's share of profits from the Non-Participating Fund, which pays
unit-linked investors, will increase gradually over the next four years.
The Dutch insurer will receive 80% of profits from the Non-Participating Fund
next year, 90% in 1997, 95% in 1998 and 100% in 1999.
``What the with-profits policyholders are doing over the next three years is
selling that profit stream for a capital sum,'' Mr Dumble said.
Although AEGON will be left in full charge of Scottish Equitable in 1999, the
interests of with-profits policyholders will remain protected by a trust
company set up in 1993 to represent them.
This trust company will continue to hold reserve powers over key matters such
as the distribution of bonuses.
``The With-Profits Fund which belongs to the with-profits policyholders will
always be ring-fenced from any other activity,'' Mr Dumble said.

THE Scottish League Management Committee decided yesterday to take no further
action on the suggestions submitted to them for reconstruction by the first
division clubs.
But the fight is still on to change the present set-up. And St Johnstone
chairman Geoff Brown warned that some of the clubs who have maintained a
full-time policy - as his own has done - may have to end that if a bigger
premier division does not soon become a reality.
Initially it had seemed that the debate had ended when League secretary Peter
Donald emerged from the three-and-a-half hours long meeting to announce the
management committee's verdict.
It was only after the official statement that Brown insisted the fight was far
from over and that a formal proposal was likely to be made to the League.
Donald said simply: ``The management committee this morning were discussing the
first divison suggestion for league reconstruction which would increase the
premier division to 16 teams.
``It was discussed fully and it was felt that it would not attract the
necessary support to warrant the calling of an extraordinary general meeting
and therefore no action will be taken.
``We realise, of course, that fresh proposals may come forward, but there was
no suggestion that the present plans would be supported by the 75% of the votes
which are required for change to take place this season.''
However, minutes later, Geoff Brown, who had been one of the main backers of
the discussion paper which had been presented, insisted that the clubs in
favour of a 16-club premier division would return with a fresh look at the
current set-up.
Brown argued powerfully for change, and pointed out that the most recent
alterations to the league had been carried by only a single vote.
``That, he said,``is why the fight for change will continue. There has been no
enormous support in the recent past for changes which have taken place and,
therefore, that encourages us to go forward.''
The main objections yesterday from some of the bigger clubs represented at the
management committee - the likes of Rangers, Aberdeen and Hibs - appeared to
centre around changes to the League Cup competition.
Donald explained: ``The way the tournament has been played over the past few
seasons has been exciting and it has been popular with the clubs and with the
supporters. There was also concern expressed at the reduction in league games
to just 30 each season.''
Brown, however, made a spirited defence of the first division case. He claimed:
``Some of the clubs who have maintained full time playing staffs will not be
able to continue to do so unless there is change.
``Many of us have built new stadiums and now we have to look at the oncost. It
is not easy. We have been tottering along for the last 20 or 30 years but we
cannot keep going in the same way.
``Playing each other four times every season is a recipe for staleness. I don't
think that it helps our game develop in the way most of us want to see it go.
Ask any of the managers and they will tell you.
``The first division was unanimously behind the discussion document which was
presented today. Now we shall go back and think again and look at modifications
which may be made. We are not giving up on this because it is too important to
do that.
``I cannot say whether any club will go to the wall, you would have to ask the
bank managers about that one, but we have all been living above our means and
that cannot go on.
``There is one club now which supports this move who were recently relegated
and their experience has changed their view of what is right for the game in
this country.''
Brown's reference was obviously to Dundee United whose chairman Jim McLean is
now fully supportive of the move for change after previously backing the status
quo.
The big guns remain lined up against any alterations, along with most of the
second and third division sides. Much lobbying requires to be done by Brown and
his allies before they can gain the support they require.
One thing seems sure. The people behind this current demand for a 16-club
premier division will not go away.

SCOTLAND will use the A game against Italy early in the new year as a dress
rehearsal for the Five Nations' Championship, and despite 11 changes in
position and personnel from the line-up which drew with Western Samoa, there
still is no place for stand-off Craig Chalmers.
Although he won his forty-sixth cap in the 15-15 draw against the Samoans last
month, Chalmers is relegated to the bench, with Gregor Townsend taking over the
pivotal fly-half role.
The revamped side for the game at Rieti, near Rome, on January 6, which SRU
director of rugby Jim Telfer said yesterday had taken on fresh importance in
view of the Five Nations opener against Ireland a fortnight later, also sees a
first A cap for 19-year-old Edinburgh Academicals' lock Scott Murray, and a
recall to No.8 for Bath's Eric Peters.
Telfer said the selection - made by mutual consent by the senior team
management - reflected his disappointment with the Scotland display against
Western Samoa.
Nevertheless, it was, he said, not necessarily the strongest combination
Scotland could field at the moment and included ``one or two'' tactical
experiments. The Italians now represent a ``fairly formidable force'' and that
had been reflected, too, in the selection.
Despite this being very much a front-line Scotland side full caps will not be
awarded by the SRU.
The only survivors from the Scotland side which played Western Samoa are Rowen
Shepherd, Kenny Logan, Bryan Redpath, David Hilton, Stuart Reid, and Rob
Wainwright, who will captain Scotland for the second time.
With Townsend moved to stand-off and Graham Shiel omitted from the squad, Scott
Hastings and Ian Jardine provide a more physical presence in the centre,
something which Telfer said yesterday was an absolute necessity in
international rugby.
Craig Joiner and Kevin McKenzie return after injury as does Peter Wright after
his suspension. Stewart Campbell, who was on the bench against the Samoans,
partners Murray in the second row, and the back-row unit - with Stuart Reid at
blindside flanker, Peters at No.8, and Wainwright at open-side - offers the
kind of blend that some had sought before the Samoan game.
The preference for young Murray to Doddie Weir at lock undoubtedly will act as
a spur to the Melrose man - he was dropped after the game against South Africa
a year ago, but came back to feature in at least part of the Five Nations'
campaign and the World Cup. Similarly, the selection of Townsend ahead of
Chalmers - criticised by Telfer after the Samoan game - offers the kind of
competition for specific places which the management are keen to foster.
Telfer said that the decision to pitch Murray into the big-time had not been
taken lightly. ``He's a very good player who has proved himself with Scotland's
under-21s and in the district matches, but this is a big step up for him.''
The director of rugby said that Townsend had been preferred to Chalmers - as he
had been a couple of seasons ago - because they wanted to look anew at the
Northampton man as a stand-off. ``Gregor is a stand-off. He was brought up as a
stand-off. It's unfortunate from our point of view that Northampton have the
new English stand-off there and Gregor is playing in the centre, but we know
what Craig can do.''
The omission of Gary Armstrong from the squad is also a talking point. Derrick
Patterson returns to the bench. ``We feel that Gary Armstrong is not back to
the kind of form that people had hoped he would be. He is still not as sharp as
he was before his injury.''
Scott Murray's elevation to top-grade international rugby has been rapid by any
standards. The 6ft 7in, 15-stone youngster has played just two and a half
seasons of serious rugby, first with Preston Lodge for a season and the rest of
the time with Edin-burgh Academicals, where he came under the tutelage of David
Sole and Jeremy Richardson.

CHELTENHAM'S controversially late abandonment earlier this month is to be
investigated by the Jockey Club disciplinary committee.
Having studied reports prepared after racing was called off at the track on
December 9, the Jockey Club stewards have decided the committee should hold an
inquiry to determine whether acting clerk of the course Edward Gillespie
complied with the rules of racing.
Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse explained: ``It has yet to be clarified which
rules are in question, just that there is a case to answer.
``There are a number of instructions issued to clerks which they are asked to
follow, and a clerk should at all times act in a professional manner.
``The most obvious similar case was at Newcastle two years ago on Fighting
Fifth Hurdle day, when racing was abandoned and clerk of the course David
Parmley was fined #600.''
The late decision to abandon the Cheltenham meeting, which featured the
Tripleprint Gold Cup, caused controversy as no warnings that the fixture was in
jeopardy had been issued.
Some 8000 racegoers had been admitted to the course when the abandonment was
announced at 12.55pm, 35 minutes after the scheduled off time for the delayed
first race.
No date has been set for the inquiry.

DESPITE Scotland's indifferent international results last season, the Scottish
Basketball Association's new management board have given a vote of confidence
to their senior honorary coaches.
Allan Turner and Lesley Beaton again will take on the unpaid tasks of coaching
the Scottish senior teams later this season.
Turner, who no longer coaches regularly at senior level but has led the
Scottish team on their last two European campaigns, beat off opposition from at
least two coaches with senior Scottish club teams.
The Cumnock Team Corsa club man from Ayrshire, and his assistant from Troon,
Tom Campbell, will now be responsible for taking Scotland to the Promotions Cup
in San Marino in June.
As far as the financially impoverished SBA is concerned, however, the San
Marino event offers two positive aspects: the international governing body,
FIBA, funds the accommodation costs, leaving Scotland only to cover the travel.
Originally, the senior and under-23 coaching posts were to be combined, but the
under-23 programme looks like being restricted not least due to England
withdrawing from the proposed first Home Countries championship which Scotland
was to host.
Scotland have now been offered the Under-18 championship instead and that will
go on in April, but there is one major embarrassment - there is at present no
coach for the Scottish junior men's side.
John Grant from Arbroath Musketeers, who led the side in last April's European
qualifying event at the Kelvin Hall, has moved down to coach the Scottish cadet
(under-16) schoolboys team, although he is still willing to assist the juniors.
But there were no applications for the junior position and the SBA's
performance and excellence convener Bob Brewer is keen to hear from anyone with
the appropriate qualifications interested in taking on the job.

BRITAIN'S overall third-quarter current account trade deficit, which includes
``invisible'' earnings from financial services and tourism, proved at #1343m to
be more favourable than the #2000m or so many in the market had been expecting
though along with the accompanying third-quarter GDP it made little impact in
financial markets except, perhaps, to provide some underpinning for sterling.
The visible deficit balance of #3371m was offset by estimated invisible
earnings of #2028m. Moreover, previous quarters' deficits have been revised
downward - the second quarter from #2400m to #1176m - to paint a much brighter
UK trading picture.
As usual it was invisibles which saw the major revision, particularly the
figures for investment income.
On the basis of the latest figures, which take the total for the year to
#3400m, the Chancellor's forecast in his Budget last month for a balance of
payments deficit of #6500m for the current year may prove to over-cautious.
The Central Statistical Office says that changes to the current account data
for previous quarters were largely due to the results of annual 1994 inquiries,
the receipt of late and revised returns to quarterly inquiries and
re-assessment of seasonal adjustment.
Looking ahead, securities house James Capel's Adam Cole expects a modest
deterioration in the UK's external position in the fourth quarter of the year
taking the total to #5000m, or just 0.7% of GDP.
Next year is thought likely again to see only modest deterioration as a
worsening trade position is offset by an improvement in invisible trade, not
least because sterling's decline this year will push up sterling-based earnings
on the UK's overseas assets.
Meanwhile, there were no major surprises in the third-quarter national account
data. A 0.4% quarterly increase in GDP leaves it up 2.1% on a year earlier.
Consumers' expenditure growth, at 0.6%, was slightly weaker than previous
estimates but still well ahead of retail sales.
The detail of the figures shows the strongest increases in leisure
services-related expenditure, with catering up by 2% on the quarter and
transport by 2.1%.
Real personal disposable income (RPDI) fell by 0.2% in the third quarter so
that the increase in consumption was more than accounted for by a fall in the
saving ratio (down from 9.3% to 8.6%).
Adam Cole considers that the figures are further confirmation that the gloom
over consumer spending is overdone. Capel's interpretation remains that the
weakness of the housing market has been diverting consumer spending away from
durable goods and towards services.
However, with the housing market showing signs of recovery and real income
growth picking up, consumer spending growth is expected to accelerate next
year, while the unwinding of manufacturing stocks after their build-up is
expected to depress GDP growth significantly to the middle of 1996. For the
full-year growth expectations have therefore been lowered to 2.5% from 3%
previously.

Earle pounds better off
JOCKEY-turned-trainer Simon Earle is looking forward to Christmas in his new
role. He has high hopes of landing a yuletide success with Dextra Dove at
Wincanton on Boxing Day, but win, lose or draw, he has no worries about the
scales this year.
For the first time since he launched his career as a jockey in 1982 he will be
able to enjoy a Christmas dinner with no concern about his weight for the
action the following day.
``I used to think it was crazy to have racing the day after the biggest
festival of the year,'' said Earle. ``In the past, I might get drunk on
champagne, but I wouldn't be able to eat anything. But the galling thing is
that I'm lighter now than when I used to diet.
``It's because I'm working harder. I don't have time for much breakfast or
lunch and I just fit in dinner when I can.''
The 31-year-old trainer has no regrets about his decision to turn his back on a
riding career which brought him nearly 150 winners. ``It was a very big change
and training is a totally different job, but I've been really lucky the way
things have gone,'' he said.
``I've got a state-of-the-art training centre with fantastic all-weather and
grass gallops set in the wonderful Dorset countryside. There's stabling for 29
horses and we've got one of the best sponsorship deals in the country with
Dextra Lighting Systems.''
Earle's backers have had a quick return on their investment through their own
Dextra Dove, unbeaten in four runs and set to bid for a five-timer in the Lord
Stalbridge Memorial Gold Cup at Wincanton on Boxing Day.
``The aim is run at Wincanton, although he is also in at Kempton the following
day. We're gearing his season towards the Ritz Club Chase at Cheltenham and the
Grand National.
``As a jockey on Boxing Day I generally went to Wincanton, which is one of my
favourite courses. It would be wonderful to have a winner there in front of a
big local crowd as a trainer.''

<HEADLINE>Eastern markets beckon MLC sees unlimited potential for British meat exports</HEADLINE>

FAR East markets promise virtually unlimited potential for British meat exports
although competition is fierce, according to the Meat and Livestock Commission.
One of the key players in the field, the United States, is gradually shifting
its pork production enterprises westwards to tackle the growing markets in Hong
Kong, Japan, China, Korea and the Pacific Rim.
But British Meat export executives Ken Jones and Bent Windahl, who will be
leading a party of eight meat plant operators on an outward bound mission east
next March, are confident the British message is getting through.
``I feel we are winning respect in these markets but we cannot sit back. We
have to build on this success and this means continuing to go out there to sell
our products,'' says Bent Windahl.
The latest figures bear out the success story. Exports of pig meat to Hong Kong
for the first half of this year at 1670 tonnes compare with 740 tonnes for the
whole of 1994; for Korea the figures are 4704 tonnes (3728 tonnes); and for
Japan 2348 tonnes (477 tonnes).
The potential can be shown by Japan's total imports of 468,000 tonnes.
During the export mission to Hong Kong, Korea and Japan, the party hopes to
make a day trip to China for a first-hand assessment of the state of the
industry there.
The MLC's latest International Meat Market Review says that all factors point
to an increased Chinese meat demand.
``Pig meat will remain by far the largest meat production sector but feed
limitations may restrict substantial growth and therefore slow up gains in per
capita consumption.
``Poultry consumption is expected to show the greatest growth and is the sector
likely to make the most significant inroads into the export market.
``Demand for both beef and mutton is expected to grow and production volumes
will inevitably be huge on a worldwide scale. But equally actual per capita
consumption levels are likely to remain small.''
But Britain, and the rest of Europe, will not have things all their own way, as
Dr Mildred Hay of the United States Department of Agriculture recently pointed
out to an international meat conference in London.
US meat exports had more than doubled to 20% of the country's total production
in the past 15 years. This had resulted from a reshaping of the industry with
more vertical integration, better corporate management and the adoption of new
technologies.
The Gatt round had also opened up tremendous export possibilities, allowing
low-cost US producers to compete more effectively. Pressure was growing for
more freedom to farm in the States and this would provide more low-cost feed
cereals from set-aside land taken back into production.
Pork exports to Japan had risen 60% in volume terms this year, aided by the
ability of the US to supply fresh product as opposed to the frozen EU offerings.
The country expected to be a net exporter of beef from next year with a large
proportion of this aimed at South-east Asia.
At the same time, she expected to see more constraints on production building
up in some EU countries.

PLAYERS' associations throughout Europe are ready to react to the Bosman
verdict, and Scottish Players' Union secretary Tony Higgins said yesterday:
``All associations agree there is a need for a system which gives clubs
compensation for training and developing young players.
``But that system will have to have a more scientific approach than there is at
the moment. I don't know what the exact system will be, but it must be able to
answer questions such as how many hours are young players coached and how many
hours are put in on their education. Steps are already being taken towards this
kind of approach with the apprenticeship scheme.''
Hamilton manager Iain Munro revealed that he has suggested a new approach to
Scotland manager and technical director Craig Brown.
Munro said: ``I would like to see clubs take schools and youth associations in
their own area under their wings.
``It would be laid down in players' contracts that they must spend a certain
number of hours a week coaching. All of this would be overseen by the SFA. At
the end of the day the club would get the chance to sign any of these players
and pay a small fee to the SFA. If the boy did not wish to sign for the local
club but opted for a club in another area, that club would pay part of the fee
to the SFA and part to the local club who had done all the coaching work.
``If that boy was a success and was either capped or transferred on to a bigger
club a small portion of the fee would go to the SFA and to the local club to
compensate them for a job well done.''
Meanwhile, Reinhard Rauball, former chairman of German champions Borussia
Dortmund who has wide experience of legal disputes in sport, said the Bosman
ruling eventually would sink transfer fees for good.
``It is only a question of time when there will be no more transfers,'' he
said. ``The football authorities have got to get ready for it now . . . It is
no good when a decision is made in Europe and the countries then ask `What do
we do now?' People have to be ready with solutions

WHAT is the best way to re-live the atmosphere, tension and emotion of an Old
Firm match? Easy, of course. Buy The Herald Book of Old Firm Games, an
exciting, new publication which is on the shelves in time for Christmas.
It is a book not just about any Old Firm match, but about every meeting since
the war between football's greatest rivals - match reports of all the clashes,
no matter the competition, which have appeared in the sports pages of The
Herald down through the years.
We have opened our archives to help you capture the mood, the passion, and the
excitement of each era, from the forties to the nineties. Stunning pictures
also will bring back great footballing memories.
What Celtic fan would not take a great delight in being given the chance to
take himself back to the club's greatest ever victory in an Old Firm match, the
League Cup final of 1957 when they beat Rangers 7-1 at Hampden?
Billy McPhail scored a hat trick, Willie Fernie turned in one of the best
individual displays ever seen in the fixture - and the fans wrote songs and
poems about the day.
Celtic supporters also will relish looking back to 1979 when the two clubs met
at Parkhead in what was a championship decider and Celtic won a dramatic match
by 4-2.
For the Rangers fans, there is also the chance to re-live some famous
victories. Two, which came against all the odds, spring to mind.
The League Cup final of season 1970-71 when a 16-year-old Derek Johnstone took
the trophy back to Ibrox with a stunning header, and the Scottish Cup final
replay of 1966 when Danish international full-back Kai Johansen grabbed the
only goal of the game with a spectacular strike.
There is an Ally McCoist hat trick in another League Cup final, and easy 5-1
and 4-1 wins in the league during season 1988-89.
I was pleased to make a modest contribution to the book, providing
decade-by-decade summaries.
I was also given the unenviable task of choosing the 25 best players from each
club since the war. That alone is bound to spark off heated argument as so many
outstanding players had to be left out.
Every Old Firm fan has his, or her, particular memory of a Celtic-Rangers match.
No matter the memory, if it happened after 1945 it will be recorded in this
publication, which has forewords by John Greig and Billy McNeill, arguably the
best-ever captains of the two Glasgow giants.

BESIEGED Forte received both bad and good news yesterday as the City was
relaxing further into pre-Christmas torpor.
The full Takeover Panel upheld the ruling of the executive that hostile bidder
Granada was fully entitled to set out its claim that it could increase the
on-going profits of Forte by over #100m a year, before reorganisation costs.
Forte had argued that the express inclusion of this figure in its offer
document of December 14 and without a detailed breakdown failed to met the
standards relating to the provision of information as stated in the Takeover
Code.
But the Panel executive has been asked to investigate whether there may be a
need for new specific requirements covering statements where merger benefits
are quantified. However, Forte's advisers putting together the formal defence
document against the #3200m bid due by January 2 will seize upon an
authoriative hotel industry study to boost its armoury.
Britains' hotel industry is in a period of strong profits growth which is
expected to continue for another three to four years according to Pannell Kerr
Forster Associates.
They said the balance in supply and demand of hotel rooms and overall economic
growth in Britain are fueling the growing profitability of the industry.
Granada also had some encouragement.
ABN AMRO, BZW and Chemical Bank have completed the sub-underwriting of the
#2500m banking facility with 16 major banks having subscribed in addition to
the three leaders.

French tighten
grip on water
THE French grip on the English water industry appears to be tightening after a
#75m bid for a water group supplying 525,000 customers in South-east England.
Mid Kent Holdings, based in Maidstone, has received an offer from a partnership
of French groups General Utilities and Saur Water Services.
The offer at 440p a share is subject to approval by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Mid Kent is one of the 28 smaller statutory water companies. In the year to
March it made profits of #8.3m on turnover of #38.1m.
The two French companies already had a 39% stake in Mid Kent also own
individual companies supplying 4.4 million customers in Kent, Essex and Sussex.
The French bidders predictably promise to cut water shortages and improve
efficiency. More pertinently, they propose splitting the company into two and
merge the parts into their respective operations.
Optimism falls
THE number of exporters reporting higher sales rose slightly in the third
quarter, according to a Royal Bank of Scotland survey. But the survey, carried
out in September and October, showed a decline in optimism about future
prospects. Royal Bank said 61.3% of exporters had experienced a rise in orders
over the previous 12 months, up from 60.1% in its second-quarter survey. But
the number of smaller firms who said they were more optimistic about the year
ahead fell to 42% from 44%.
Courtaulds sells
INTERNATIONAL chemicals group Courtaulds has sold its Amtico flooring
subsidiary for #49m to a management buy-out team with the backing of Electra
Fleming which is acting on the behalf of clients. Courtaulds will retain a 10%
equity stake in the business and may also be entitled to a further
consideration totalling up to #3.8m.
Pay boost
BURTON chief executive John Hoerner received a pay rise and other benefits last
year totalling #362,00 to boost total emoluments to #1,001,000. The
performance-related bonus jumped from #60,000 to #387,000, while his pension
fund was topped up by an extra #20,000 at #177,000 with his salary #15,000
higher at #437,000. Mr Hoerner is currently sitting on a paper profit on the
options he can exercise of #3,226,000 with Burton shares closing unchanged at
133p last night.
Concrete move
BUILDING and construction materials group Redland has acquired 29.99% of the
voting rights in Nottingham-based aggregates and ready-mixed concrete company
Ennemix. The #2m total acquisition of 5,481,840 Ordinary shares, together with
844,857 Preference shares appear to have come from the holdings of
non-executive director E A P Sells.
SmithKline buys
SMITHKLINE Beecham is buying the leading supplier of medicines in the German
supermarket sector in a #92m deal. The healthcare giant's purchase is Abtei
Pharma, which is the leader in the mass-market sector of the German food and
vitamin supplement business. SmithKline said the acquisition of Abtei would
make it the leading consumer healthcare group in Germany when added to its
existing pharmacy business.

VOGUE is celebrating the opening of its splendid new 52,000 sq.ft furniture
showroom on Boxing Day, with a massive sale which will see everything reduced
in price. Located at 2129 London Road, Glasgow, the superstore is the
long-awaited replacement for the ``tester'' store at Baillieston, in which
Vogue put a first, tentative foot into the West of Scotland market.
The success of the exercise is obvious. The new showroom shares with Vogue's
main store in Edinburgh, flagship status, while Falkirk and Kirkcaldy each have
a smaller showroom.
Every conceivable taste has been catered for within three main halls, at London
Road. Whether you favour the traditional, modern or something quite out of the
ordinary, Vogue's diversity can fill the bill.
Managing director Robert Bremner, son of the founder Harry Bremner, began the
Vogue chain 22 years ago, said: ``The new showroom is roughly twice the size of
our last Glasgow shop, and is in a much more prominent position. There are no
parking problems, with space for more 200 cars.
``Our last showroom was a `toe in the water' exercise to see how we went down
in Glasgow; if it worked we planned to move somewhere else. It certainly did
work, but it's taken nearly two years to find this site, get planning and start
trading.''
How did the company find the Glasgow market?
``Very different to that in Edinburgh,'' Mr Bremner reports. ``People in
Glasgow are much more adventurous and style conscious - it's more enjoyable to
be buying for this market. We can buy something a little bit different; and we
are covering a wider scale here than we do in Edinburgh, in traditional and
modern as well as going a bit more avant-garde on the foreign side too. We buy
from around the world, from Europe to America, China to the Far East.''
Wander through the halls, and be amazed at the diversity of styles, the scope
for developing ideas, the range of fabrics available, and find your imagination
stimulated by lots of different room settings. There are accessories too, such
as lamps, mirrors and pictures. ``We do the more unusual ranges of lamps,''
explains Mr Bremner. ``We try to find ideas which are different.''
Vogue in Glasgow carries all home furniture with the exception of that for
kitchens and bathrooms. There is soft and leather upholstery, cabinet
furniture, beds, carpets and rugs, and customers will find too, a custom-made
curtain service offering a good range of fabrics.
Walk into the main hall on your arrival and be greeted by pine displays and a
fine selection of more modern furniture designs in lots of different finishes,
painted, metal and wood, highly lacquered Chinese pieces, marble, Spanish
furniture . . . fresh and appealing. The central area of this hall is given
over to a broad range of soft-hued luxurious leather suites.
The second hall houses the more traditional cabinet furniture in teaks,
mahogany, yew and the increasingly popular cherry, admired for its lighter
looks. Upholstery here will appeal to a broad range of tastes so much of its
design being attractive to many tastes and age groups.
``Very traditional, middle-of-the-road upholstery is probably the mainstay of
our business,'' explains Robert Bremner. ``Older people still tend to buy
upholstery and say they want it to last 15 years. By and large they are more
careful with their money, they don't tend to take things on credit, preferring
to pay in cash.
``We did a survey, and found that the majority of our customers up to about 40,
looking for upholstery, said they'd expect it to last eight-10 years. However,
they said they'd be looking to change it in four years, because they'd be bored
with it. It becomes a fashion item.''
Fashion is certainly an established part of the furniture trade now. Take black
leather, or black cabinet. ``The former is no longer normal domestic, and the
latter which, five or six years ago there would have been lots of on the floor
you couldn't give away now. We are seeing more variety. If you went back 10
years, many suites were still being bought in browns, mink, grey, autumny
shades, and in dralon. Then flat weaves came in, and now there's a big market
for them. Chenilles too, are in and selling very well. Machine washable covers
in 100% cotton on upholstery are popular too, while leather, very much a niche
market a decade ago, now accounts for 20%-25% of our upholstery sales.''
Currently fashionable, are co-ordinate suites, perhaps in blue with yellow
cushions, ethnic designs which are fairly trendy and tartan and plaids which
similarly take a trick with some people. ``Look at this revolutionary new
material,'' smiles Mr Bremner. ``It's called Buffalo.'' He points to a suite
covered in what looks and feels like soft suede . . . ``it's tremendously
practical, one of its major advantages. You can take a ballpoint across it, rub
the two pieces of cloth together, and the stain comes off. That's very new on
the market.''
Beauty of course, is in the eye of the beholder and so too is perception.
``We've tried to separate tastes here to a degree, but what one consumer sees
as being traditional, another will see as modern,'' says Robert Bremner. ``The
shabbily chic is perhaps the ideal example. We sell a lot of these in Edinburgh
to the New Town, big houses with traditional furniture, the West End of Glasgow
would be a similar market. Yet, we also sell a lot of the more compact shabbily
chics into new, smaller modern houses.''

IT is difficult for me to write this article without sounding like a bitter and
twisted old has-been. However, I would just like to point out that I am not an
old has-been.
If you want to be a successful sports person then you could pick better places
to explore your potential than Scotland. I am fiercely patriotic, but
throughout my career it has been an undoubted drawback trying to succeed in
Scotland.
The basic problem is a fundamental lack of understanding of what it takes to
reach the top in international sport. It has become a cliche but we as a nation
are too eager to chop the feet from under our heroes and heroines when they do
not fulfil expectation - which in the main is media led.
It never ceases to amaze me that so many top sports persons cite intense media
pressure as a major problem, yet the media always shouts ``humbug!'' and does
its impression of an ostrich, sticking its head in the sand. It is time for
pundits to assume a certain responsibility and look at a brighter side to
sport. This does not mean they cannot report the news, but if they could try to
emphasise the positive rather than negative opinions, it would do us all a
favour. Remember that in reporting sports news most journalists are giving an
opinion based around facts. Sports news is not black and white.
As a nation we are all too willing to participate in the country's successes,
and rightly so, but we are less willing to help sports people achieve their
goals. Sport in Scotland is grossly underfunded and most success is achieved
despite the system. Everyone has to earn a living and being an international
competitor can be a definite hindrance when looking for employment.
When I got my first permanent job I refrained from telling my prospective
employers that I ran for Scotland. In previous interviews there was a
consistent view that athletics would detract from my ability to do the job.
Consequently I spent most of the interview trying to persuade them that being
an internationalist showed a high degree of commitment and self-discipline, but
to no avail. Yet as soon as I omitted my sporting achievements I landed a job
with one of the world's biggest chemical firms.
However, attitudes soon changed. I used to train in my 44-minute lunch break,
and my boss never failed to get a dig in: ``You may run for Scotland but don't
forget where your bread and butter comes from.'' This happened every day.
Eventually, just after helping Britain win the European Championships 4x400
metres relay title I was informed that much as the company applauded my
achievements, I must choose between athletics and my career. I chose my sport
and left.
The above experience is by no means isolated, as I know from talking to many
other sports people. Little wonder that overall we are falling further behind
the rest of the world.
We still produce as much talent as ever, but other countries have found better
ways of developing and supporting their talent. While we have maintained the
status quo, the world has developed facilities and back-up. They recognise the
importance of being seen as successful on the world stage.
Cast your mind forward to June 15, 1996, when Scotland play England in Euro
'96. If Scotland win, the nation's workforce will be delirious, and production
will benefit. But if the Auld Enemy get lucky, employers may as well give them
the month off.
It is all about attitude. Most sport governing bodies cannot deal with their
top personalities. It seems inevitable that the better one gets, the more
alienated one becomes from officialdom. My governing body does not know how to
deal with top athletes. As a consequence there is little dialogue, which is a
shame, because the principal asset of any sport is its competitors. The
athletics hierarchy has become unapproachable and has little understanding of
the needs of the people they are supposed to represent. This is a sad fact in
many sports.
Scotland has a great sporting tradition but if we want it maintained we have to
change our attitude. To persuade our children to participate in sport, parents
must drag themselves from EastEnders and take their sons and daughters to
whatever sport captures their imagination. They must also maintain an interest
in what their children do rather than treat sports clubs as a creche - take an
active interest.
Government, Central and local, must help foster a climate in which the
community can capitalise on the assets of Scotland's many great sports men and
women - and the media should help the nation revel in our successes.

IF YOU were one of the in-crowd it was a wonderful day. There was a bout of
preening and back-slapping after the recent announcement that Hampden is to
receive #23m from the Millennium Commission towards the cost of transforming
the national stadium into a facility for the new age. How wonderful.
It is claimed the old ground, a large part of which has already been rebuilt,
will be the finest sports arena in Europe when completed in 1998.
Those who have campaigned for Hampden's survival are entitled to be pleased,
misguided though they are, and undoubtedly they believe they have saved
something of a small nation's heritage. Bah, and humbug as well.
The desire to save Hampden at a cost of tens of millions was fuelled in part by
the idiotic and romantic notion that Scotland's international footballers could
play only inside a huge bowl gouged out of the Mount Florida landscape. If
that's true only God and not Craig Brown can help us when we go to England next
summer for the European Championship finals.
It is always nice to be charitable and I do try, especially at this time of the
year when we should all show a little understanding and work from compassion.
However, it is no more than the content of a Christmas pie - that is, a dollop
of mince - to believe this country needs a national football ground. Scotland
doesn't need a national stadium. What it does need is a rechannelling of
finances into the development of the game.
Nice, shiny stadia look smart, but in football terms they can reflect a false
economy in that the standard of play within these impressive structures whose
banks of stands reach into the skies can be poverty stricken. The
recommendations contained within the Taylor Report forced issues and compelled
clubs to accelerate reconstruction plans, and in many cases confront the
problem for the first time, but we must be careful always to remain in touch
with the priority. Continuous improvement is the only game.
How depressing it would be if we find ourselves in possession of a collection
of splendid grounds which tower above communities as little more than monuments
to our ignorance and neglect.
Many within football digested Fergus McCann's Arena Column in these pages the
other day and reacted in typical fashion. They protested: ``Get him, he's only
five minutes in the game and he's telling us what we need. What does he know
about the Scottish game?''
The Celtic chairmman has managed to put his foot in it a few times since he
took over, but you don't have to be steeped in tradition to realise when
something is turning rotten. You don't have to have had a family connection
with some lowly club which never has and never will go anywhere in the business
to realise somewhere along the line we all were taken down the wrong road.
Football's administration often can state their cases eloquently and forcibly
and in general the country tends to go along with them, but the establishment
are not always correct and we shouldn't always believe something is worthwhile
or necessary because they say so. They are capable of getting it wrong and they
also have been guilty of acting slowly. For years they behaved like ostriches
unwilling to tackle problems which were obvious to many of the people who hand
over their money at the turnstiles.
Hampden is a mistake. It was never a priority in a small country in which clubs
were willing to redevelop their own facilities.
Thought, and all available money, should have been directed towards recruitment
and coaching schemes because nothing is more important in football than an
ability to play. Without good players the game's importance will dwindle and
supporters will pay anywhere to watch class acts.
Of course, the fans cannot be crammed into dilapidated facilities, but they
don't need state-of-the-art accommodation. In an ideal world, one in which
Scottish football was awash with wealth, yes, but not in reality which is a
life of shortages.
No-one is naive enough to think the #23m handed over from the National Lottery
- the single largest payment from that source made in Scotland - would still
have found its way across the Border without the work and effort of the
National Stadium Committee, the SFA, and Queen's Park and, of course, Hampden
as the fulcrum, but millions of football's money have been spent on this one
ground. That is unacceptable and arguments that the SFA are trying to look
ahead and provide what they believe FIFA will want from any country which
applies to host major games and competitions are fatuous.
It is this kind of logic which merely strengthens the notion that we have an
administration which is more concerned with their own image and ability to
lobby in corridors of power rather than the game itself. I would rather see our
players capable of competing with Europe's strong nations than watch others
play finals in our grounds.
Also, can anyone tell me why a quaint little amateur club which occupies a
place in the lower reaches of the Scottish game be owners and the home side of
Hampden Park. They own the 33 acres and all assets and buildings on them, but
Scottish football has subsidised the stadium for almost a century. That cannot
be correct.
That Queen's Park should own the lot, even though they don't make a profit and
money is ploughed back into the game, is incongruous. It is not a case of them
doing the game a favour, it is the sport which has done them the service and
that money supplied by the people, who are not all football fans, should be
used to make the place even more splendid for the Amateurs to play on is a
nonsense.

A MANCHESTER-based company yesterday announced the acquisition of Q96 FM and
immediately voiced hopes of increasing the Paisley radio station's audience
five-fold.
Independent Radio Group (IRG), which is listed on the Alternative Investment
Market, purchased a controlling stake in Q96 by buying out Peter Ross and his
associates. Mr Ross, chairman of Bowfield Country Club in Howwood,
Renfrewshire, was part of the consortium which founded Q96 three years ago.
IRG paid between #750,000 and #1m for 67.5% of the Paisley station's issued
share capital and as a result has 74.1% of the voting rights.
The group was set up by the three former executive directors of Trans World
Communications. Trans World ran eight radio stations in England and Wales,
including Piccadilly Key 103 in Manchester, but was sold to media group EMAP
last year.
Two months ago, IRG raised #10m through a placing on the Stock Exchange's
Alternative Investment Market for smaller and growing companies to buy nine
local radio stations with a ``popular music'' remit. Q96 is its first
acquisition and suited its other requirement that the target station must have
a ``poor audience'' which can be increased.
Although IRG chief executive Michael Connolly sees significant potential to
expand Q96's audience, he does not envisage a war with Scottish Radio Holdings'
Radio Clyde because he believes it has a different audience.
He said: ``Clyde isn't a target of ours.''
Q96 has a defined marketing area of 758,000 ``adults'', aged 15 and above, in
Paisley and the surrounding districts.
Mr Connolly said of Q96: ``Only 6% of the population listen to them. Within
Trans World, we would have expected in FM to do 30%.
``Q96 was launched in the mists of the recession. We think, with our experience
and the resources we have got, that we will be able to build that from 6%
upwards.''
The ``friendly'' takeover was welcomed by Harry McNab, the Q96 chairman who led
the founding consortium.
He said: ``The (Q96) board was unanimous. We know they have the resources and

I could not play, but I was bloody good at stopping the other buggers playing
against us
JACK CHARLTON
WITH the dignity expected of Jack Charlton, the amiable big Geordie decided
yesterday to end his nine-and-a-half-year love affair with the the Republic of
Ireland.
He missed out on his last football ambition, taking the Republic to his native
England for the finals of the European Championship, but history will surely
record the amazing football revolution he started in the Republic.
The Irish people took the raw-boned, irascible ``Big Jack'' to their hearts
after he guided the team to two World Cup finals and one European Championships
final, and in the process restoring a nation's sporting pride.
His uncompromising methods and tactics did not always please the purist's eye,
but they were mightily effective and invariably embarrassing to rivals who
considered themselves much more sophisticated.
Charlton's edge was in persuading good players to perform simple tasks with
dedicated diligence. Put simply, they stopped the opposition playing and
imposed their own will with rugged endeavour and single-minded attention to
detail.
But recently, and quite suddenly, other sides seem to have found the answer to
Charlton's tactics, or was it just that Charlton's workhorses had no more left
to give? Either way, he admitted the game had changed and although he belatedly
tried to change with it, events have shown change is not really in his nature.
New instructions about patience and counter-attacking ploys only seemed to
confuse players who had revelled in Charlton's up-and-at-'em doctrine.
The brave new world of possession football was never meant for Charlton, a
safety-first centre half who would sooner put the ball in row X rather than
risk being robbed near his own penalty box.
As a player, he was always overshadowed by ``wor kid,'' younger brother Bobby,
a football genius with an explosive shot for Manchester United and England,
although he was still good enough to collect a World Cup winner's medal
alongside Bobby in Sir Alf Ramsey's celebrated team of 1966.
While Bobby was the epitome of the English sporting gentleman, blessed with
style and grace, Jack was the kind of rough, tough defender everyone wanted in
their side.
``I could not play, but I was bloody good at stopping the other buggers playing
against us,'' he once said.
He went on to enjoy only limited success as a club manaager at Middlesbrough,
Sheffield Wednesday, and Newcastle. But his impact on the international arena,
after England snubbed his application to succeed Don Revie in the national job,
gave Republic of Ireland fans pride in their team and, ultimately, a high
expectation of continued success that was impossible to deliver.
Charlton built steadily for two years before victory over England in the
quarter-finals of the 1988 European Championships in Germany kicked off a
golden era which shone even more brightly when the Republic reached the last
eight at the 1990 World Cup in Italy thanks to three draws and a
never-to-be-forgotten penalty shoot-out triumph over Romania.
They failed to qualify for the 1992 European Championships, but the fairy-tale
did not end there. Two years later, Charlton's jolly green army was on the
march to the World Cup finals in the United States, and this time they enjoyed
possibly their greatest single triumph, an opening match win over Italy, before
bowing out against the Dutch in the last 16.
Initial optimism that they had picked up the baton again after four splendid
wins and a draw at the start of the current European qualifying trail was
suddenly and startlingly exposed by the embarrassment of goalless frustration
in Liechtenstein, a team seemingly there just to make up the numbers.
Four defeats in five matches, culminating with the 2-0 play-off defeat against
Holland at Anfield last week, was something Charlton had never previously had
to handle in his 93-match reign. He could live with those and even the jibes of
the media, but not disdain from the southern Irish people.
They had, after all, made him a Freeman of Dublin, a city where, legend has it,
he once paid for something with a cheque that was never cashed but framed and
proudly displayed like a Renoir painting. In a reflective moment recently
before his departure, he said: ``I can take losing matches but never want to
lose the warmth of feeling the Irish people have given me. I do not want it to
come to the the point where I'm getting out with them disliking me.''
Thankfully, it has not reached that point. In the end, a predictable man has
followed the script, just as he did when quitting club management spells at
Ayresome Park, Hillsborough, and St James' Park before the natives on the
terraces became too restless in lean times.
For Jack Charlton is, and always was, a man of the people.
Officialdom, functions and media attention got on his nerves and he rarely
bothered to disguise the fact. But his shooting, hunting, and fishing image is
entirely accurate and he is never happier than when knee-deep in a stream with
rod in hand.
Publicly, his instinctive honesty often dropped him into traps with snipers
looking for flaws in an icon. In turn, he could be rude, charming,
bad-tempered, jolly, and belligerent.
Privately, given the chance, he would laugh and joke, swear and cuss with
practically anyone who wanted to sit down and talk about football over a pint
of Guinness.
Much has been made of the way he was snubbed by England when applying for the
manager's job a decade ago, but Charlton would probably not have lasted five
minutes in the politically-correct portals of the English FA.
With the FA of Ireland, his word was law, which was all right when things were
going well, as they almost always did.
Now the game has truly gone for Big Jack, but nobody should ever forget the
vast contribution he made to it.
q CHARLTON'S record with the Republic of Ireland: played 93, won 46, drawn 30,

MERCEDES tends to lose the place a little when what it does ceases to be
engineering-led, writes ROSS FINLAY. Engineering is the Stuttgart company's
real area of expertise, and when it returns to a line of technical development
abandoned something like 60 years ago, it is time to sit up and take notice.
This is what has happened with the new C230 Kompressor range, Kompressor being
the German for supercharger. Mercedes used supercharging in racing,
sports-racing and massive touring cars in the Twenties and Thirties, but gave
it up for production cars even while its grand prix cars were obliterating all
opposition towards the end of that period.
Mercedes is heading for a record UK sales year, expecting to have delivered
32,500 cars by the end of this month. One curious feature is that the
performance-modified AMG models have noticeably higher sales in Scotland than
in the UK as a whole, which suggests that the supercharged cars will be of
particular interest here.
Although turbocharging is currently more popular, it and supercharging have
exactly the same purpose. An internal combustion engine works better the more
air that can be crammed into it, especially high-density cold air, which is why
the Mercedes also has an intercooler. Not just air on its own, of course, but
the air/fuel mixture which maintains the combustion process.
When going back to forced induction petrol engines, Mercedes ignored
turbochargers, because these exhaust-gas driven machines have an inevitable,
however slight, turbo lag. The belt-driven supercharger makes for better
throttle response, and it is ``with'' the engine all the way, helping
acceleration from low revs, whereas a turbo usually wafts in with useful boost
perhaps a third or halfway up the engine's rev range.
The C230 Kompressor comes at prices from #25,300 for the Classic and Esprit
models, via #28,000 for the Elegance to #28,400 for the lowered-suspension
Sport. I would happily trade the Sport's firmer handling for the better ride
quality of the Elegance. And the interior appearance of the Elegance was a
reminder that, although I am no great admirer of the C-class fascia, Mercedes
has at last decided to style in its walnut trim, rather than just slap it on as
a token luxury item.
Mercedes is keen to compare the 193bhp 2.3-litre four-cylinder Kompressor
engine with the 2.8-litre six-cylinder unblown C280 which peaks at the same
figure. The Kompressor's on-road performance, with power sweeping in from low
engine revs, is formidable. It will accelerate to 60mph in just over eight
seconds, provide an autobahn maximum above 140mph, and give instant access to
tremendous reserves of torque.
But the car is completely untemperamental, easing down to pottering speeds
without any sign of being muscle-bound. On light load, the supercharger
disengages. And, since a forced induction engine is a more efficient engine,
both fuel economy and exhaust emissions benefit.
The Kompressor is far more economical than the C280. It will put up fuel
returns like 46mpg at 56mph, 36 at 75 and 25mpg on the urban cycle. Or 34mpg on
the new Euromix calculations. Oddly enough, until next August, when the new
Mercedes five-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission becomes
available, all Kompressors sold here will have manual gearboxes, despite the
known preference of UK customers for easy changing.
Old-style superchargers howled or whined. Some modern types retain those noise
effects. Mercedes says it has done its best to cut the noise levels right down,
but the cars available during the Scottish test session seemed to be rather
variable.
A mechanically-driven supercharger will never be entirely silent. To me, part
of the appeal in driving a supercharged car is being aware of, but not
disturbed by, the blower at work.
I hardly noticed, from the sound effects, that the Sport I tried was
supercharged at all. In the Elegance the rising hum during hard acceleration,
and the background sigh which accompanied a release of the throttle, were
enjoyable. On the other hand, one colleague insisted that a third car's blower
was definitely rattly under full acceleration.
This is something which will have to be sorted out, and may well be on the
showroom cars. But the C230 Kompressor is generally a most impressive car. If
supercharging can boost performance while retaining a crisp throttle action,
increase economy and reduce emissions as this Mercedes demonstrates, the
response to its reappearance in executive-class cars must be welcome back!

inaccuracy.
The quoted Milk Marque price is out of date. Milk Marque has been paying
members a higher price of 25ppl, based on a standard litre of 4.1% butterfat
and 3.3% protein since October. This resulted in an increase in the price
received by members of nearly 0.5ppl.
A bonus of 0.3ppl has been paid on milk supplied between April and October this
year, with an intention to pay a similar bonus for November to March. The
majority of members also receive a bonus of 0.22ppl for producing milk with low

DUTCH international defender Johan de Kock gave what local observers described
as a ``solid performance'' in Breda on Wednesday as Roda drew 0-0 with NAC, a
game watched by Celtic manager Tommy Burns.
The 31-year-old de Kock, who has also attracted the interest of Graeme Souness
in his role as manager of Turkish side Galatasaray, coped well with most of
what the home team could conjure up in an attacking sense.
However, there appears to be a strong possibility, acording to Dutch sources,
that a much younger man at a much more attractive price could be a serious
contender for any Celtic move.
The 22-year-old centre half of NAC, Dick van Burik, who was injured and unable
to play on Wednesday, has also been watched by the Parkhead club and has been
impressive.
Van Burick is a graduate of the Ajax school and, although the Amsterdam club
let him go for #150,000 after he had spent a year on loan to Breda, his form
has been such that the Ajax training has reputedly not been wasted.
A former Dutch youth cap, van Burik suffered a slight hamstring injury last
week when he was watched by Celtic but, as his team will not play again until
after the New Year, will have plenty of time to recover.
The former team-mate of Pierre van Hooydonk is priced at #350,000 as against
the #1.6m for the very much more experienced de Kock.
q NOTTINGHAM Forest manager Frank Clark last night insisted justice had been
done after Liverpool striker Stan Collymore's bid to win a #400,000-plus claim
against his former club was thrown out by Premier League officials.
Collymore maintained he was entitled to 5% of the British record #8.5m fee when
he left Forest during the summer, declaring the payment was due because he had
not requested a transfer.
But an FA Premier League board yesterday announced they had not been
``persuaded'' by Collymore's version of events and that Forest were therefore
not obliged to pay up.
Forest have, however, been instructed to pay an outstanding signing-on fee of
#150,000, agreed when Collymore moved to the City Ground from Southend for
#2.2m in 1993.
It was a decision Clark feels fully vindicated Forest's refusal to bow to
Collymore's demands, with the midlands club insisting the striker had
engineered his transfer, even though a formal request was never put in writing.
The Premier League board said they were ``not persuaded Mr Collymore was sold
at the club's request, which was the requirement to trigger the 5% of any
transfer fee under the terms of the player's contract with Nottingham Forest.''

BATTLE was joined yesterday between BT and its regulator Oftel as the latter
unveiled details of its plan to assume a broader approach to combating
anti-competitive behaviour.
Rejecting what some took to be a more conciliatory move by Oftel's
director-general Don Cruickshank when he welcomed BT's decision to set up a
compliance department, BT declared that any extension to his powers should be a
matter for the Government and Parliament.
``The new powers which the director-general proposes to take for himself would
give him virtually unchallengeable power to decide that anything done in the
British telecommunications industry was anti-competitive,'' said Alan Rudge,
deputy managing director of BT.
Mr Cruickshank said he could not see why BT should object in principle to his
plan as it was less broad than a similar condition in its licence that BT had
already accepted in respect of its Concert international telecoms operation.
Oftel released a consultation paper on the proposed licence changes which also
include deleting many existing ones. BT objected that it would have no right of
appeal against Oftel's decisions.
Mr Butler was particularly concerned that the new rules would largely determine
whether BT would be allowed to reduce prices on certain services or introduce
new ones. For example, BT would be required to warn rival operators of planned
new services ``sufficiently far in advance to enable them to respond with their
own offering''.
If agreement cannot be reached between Oftel and BT the matter will go to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a definitive ruling, which would probably
take the best part of 1996 to be forthcoming.

Olympics
RUPERT Murdoch's News Corporation has intensified efforts to add the Sydney
2000 Olympic Games to their sporting portfolio by forming an alliance with the
organisers to win European television rights, according to Australia's leading
financial newspaper.
``The innovative deal involves a bid by a News-led consortium for European
rights to both the Sydney Games and the Winter 2002 Games in Salt Lake City in
the US,'' said a report in the Australian Financial Review.
``The move is seen by media observers as an aggressive attempt to wrest control
of Olympics coverage from the powerful European Broadcasting Union, which
represents national broadcasters across Europe.''
News Corporation are behind rugby league's new Super League, the European arm
of which starts in March.
OLYMPIC doubles champion Boris Becker yesterday announced he won't defend his
title in Atlanta next year. ``I have personal reasons,'' Becker told said. The
three-times Wimbledon champion, 28 today, teamed up with compatriot Michael
Stich to win gold in Barcelona in 1992.
``With Wimbledon and the US Open, I would be traveling eight weeks in a row. I
can't do that,'' added Becker, who is ranked fourth in the world.

A DOUBLE from Hounslow's Rob Thompson helped Britain beat hosts Egypt 3-1
yesterday in Cairo. Despite feeling unwell, the centre forward came on as a
substitute to transform the match, scoring within 30 seconds of his entrance
and later sealing victory by netting again.
Yesterday's defeat of the African Games silver medallists was much more
convincing than Wednesday's 2-0 success. Russell Garcia, player-coach at
Barcelona's Polo Club, struck for the second time in two days to put the
tourists ahead after nine minutes.
Egypt equalised after 15 minutes through Ibrahim Tawfik, but Thompson came on
six minutes later and deflected Chris Mayer's long corner into the roof of the
net. The clinching goal came from an inch-perfect pass by Thomson's namesake,
Nick.
Ski-ing
MARTINA Ertl of Germany, fastest in both legs, recorded her third World Cup win
of the season yesterday with a giant slalom success at Veysonnaz, Switzerland.
Ertl clocked an aggregate 2min 0.06sec for a 1.49sec victory over Italian
Sabina Panzanini.
Austrian Anita Wachter, second fastest on the first leg, lost time towards the
finish of the second run to come home third in 2-01.79. Her compatriot, overall
leader Alexandra Meissnitzer, finished sixth to retain the overall World Cup
lead with 488 points. Wachter improved to second from third overall with 439.

MORE than 1000 policemen will be on riot duty at tomorrow's eagerly awaited
top-of-the-table clash between Fiorentina and AC Milan in Florence.
Live television coverage of the serie A game for the entire Tuscany region is
expected, while the expected 2000 Milan fans will be escorted to and from the
ground.
League leaders Milan come into the game one point ahead of Fiorentina, with
Parma a further point away in third and Juventus fourth, five behind Milan.
Fiorentina's notoriously explosive fans are hoping that their side can knock
Milan off the top of the table, but their shrewd coach Claudio Ranieri
dismisses talk of his side winning the title. He insists that qualifying for
the UEFA Cup is his priority.
Fiorentina's Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta also tried to play down the
significance of the game. ``One match, even an important one, won't make us
lose our heads,'' he said.

SUPERCHARGING has a long, zigzag history, writes Ross Finlay. The Roots-type
Eaton supercharger on the Mercedes C230 Kompressor works on a mechanical
principle established before there were any suitable vehicle engines to use it.
In the 1860s Francis Marion Roots and the fabulously-named Philander Highley
Roots from good old Cornersville, Indiana, patented a pump-cum-blower with two
rotating figure-of-eight shaped lobes. The Roots system could ``sook or blaw''
most fluids. It has remained the type name for this kind of action, although
the Roots brothers are sometimes confused with the founders of the Rootes Group
here.
Aero-engineers first realised the advantages of forced induction, especially at
higher altitudes where the air is thin. The American manufacturer Chadwick
pioneered supercharged car engines during 1908.
In 1922 Mercedes raced two supercharged sports cars in the Targa Florio, and a
year later the first blown formula car at Indianapolis. But Fiat scored the
first supercharged grand prix victory, in France that same season.
Mercedes entered the Le Mans 24-Hour Race in 1930 with a massive seven-litre
240bhp blown sports model. It could spin its wheels in any gear, and even the
great Rudi Caracciola was warned never to give it full power for more than 15
seconds at a time.
By the end of the decade, Mercedes grand prix cars were using two-stage Roots
superchargers, one blowing into the other, which blasted the mixture into the
engine at previously unheard-of pressures.
It was not all German expertise, however. During the Second World War the
Merlin aero-engine never changed its capacity or rev limit, but the power
output doubled from the original figure. Rolls-Royce was showing its mastery of
supercharger technology.

SEVEN Stirling County players, including two capped backs, Kenny Logan and Ian
Jardine, return to Glasgow's team for the inter-district championship match
against the South at Philiphaugh, Selkirk, on Sunday (kick-off 2pm).
Logan, Jardine, and five County colleagues - Angus Turner, Gordon Mackay,
Malcolm Norval, Brian Robertson, and John Gibson - were unavailable for the
district's match against Connacht in Galway last Saturday, when Glasgow won
22-16, because they were playing for Stirling in the Premier League match
against Heriot's.
Robertson, at tight head, is back in the Glasgow fold after he had been a
stand-by replacement for North and Midlands in the match against Western Samoa
last month.
Glasgow's selectors have named nine forwards for the Selkirk match as they have
yet to decide on the composition of their pack. Team:
G Breckenridge (GHK); A Turner, I C Jardine (both Stirling County), A Garry
(Watsonians), K M Logan (Stirling County); C MacGregor (Glasgow Academicals), C
Little (GHK); forwards from J Gibson (Stirling County), G Bulloch (West of
Scotland), B Robertson, M Norval (both Stirling County), G Perrett (West of
Scotland), F Wallace (Boroughmuir), captain, D McVey (Ayr), G Mackay (Stirling
County), I Sinclair (Watsonians). Replacements -T Mathewson (Glasgow
Academicals), C Sangster (Stirling County), J Weston (Watsonians), G Doran
(Glasgow Academicals), C Docherty (GHK).
q KEN Baillie, Edinburgh Academicals' full back, will have his first under-21
district game of the season for Glasgow when he returns for the final
championship match against Edinburgh at Murrayfield on Wednesday (kick-off
6pm). Craig Sangster, Stirling County's full back, also returns, though playing
at stand-off alongside Jamie Weston, Watsonians' scrum half. Team:
K Baillie (Edinburgh Academicals); G Caldwell (GHK), A Bulloch (West of
Scotland), D Ablett (Glasow Academicals), J Craig (West of Scotland); C
Sangster (Stirling County), J Weston (Watsonians); D Porte (Glasgow
Academicals), C Docherty (GHK), D Jamieson (West of Scotland), S Begley
(Glasgow Academicals), G Macfarlane (West of Scotland), N Adams (GHK), C
Houston (Glasgow Southern), R Wylie (Stirling County). Replacements -Tony
Greenshields (West of Scotland), M Hose (Edinburgh Academicals), D Wilson
(Cambuslang), S Allison (Kilmarnock), R Harvey (Cartha Queen's Park), M Smith
(Watsonians), R Anderson (Glasgow Southern).

HAMILTON are facing a selection crisis that could mean their revival lasts just
90 minutes. The first division basement side have four players suspended and
three injured for the Boxing Day clash at Dundee United.
Paul Hartley, Paul McKenzie, Gary Clark and Stephen McInulty are banned with
crocked trio Martin McIntosh, John McQuade and Scott McCulloch joining them on
the sidelines.
Accies beat Dumbarton 3-0 last week, but assistant manager Sandy Clark knows
the missing seven will make it doubly tough at Tannadice.
Clark said: ``We don't have problems to seek for available players and it will
certainly stretch our resources. It's a pity Hartley is missing because he has
been playing particularly well recently.
``Obviously, it will be very difficult against Dundee United, but we will go
and do our best.''

THE Scottish Rugby Union expect to have the country's top 23 players under
contract by the weekend in a deal which will cost the union more than #500,000
and which will gross the players a potential #25,000 apiece.
Eventually, the union will have the 42 players in the full international and A
squads signed up, with details of the shadow squad deal yet to be worked out.
Details of the top team contract were revealed yesterday at a Murrayfield press
conference by SRU senior vice-president Fred McLeod who said it was the result
of detailed negotiations between the players, their representatives, and the
union.
``The contract, which Rob Wainwright, Craig Chalmers, and Scott Hastings as the
players' representatives have recommended to the other players, is extremely
fair and represents a sensible balance between what the union can afford and
the realities of the new age of professional rugby,'' he added.
Players have been asked to sign the contracts by tomorrow and the union do not
expect any dissenters. If a player does not sign then he will no longer be
considered a member of the squad.
The players each will receive a #5000 retainer plus #3000 apiece for each Five
Nations' match in which they appear. A #2500 fee will be paid retrospectively
to those who appeared in the game against Western Samoa last month.
There also will be bonuses ranging from #1100 to #5500 per individual depending
on Scotland's ranking at the close of the Five Nations' championship. The Scots
will be paid #1100 for finishing last. A separate contract will be negotiated
for the tour to New Zealand next summer.
Yesterday McLeod indicated that the SRU's preference had been for bonuses to be
dependent on individual match results. The players, however, have been against
that. ``That is where the SRU came from originally but it came down to a
negotiating situation,'' he said.
The #25,000 which the SRU is offering Scotland's internationalists is small
beer compared to the #100,000-plus which Antipodean stars can expect and falls
short of the #36,000 deal signed by England last week. However, it compares
favourably with the reported #20,000 - #24,000 available to players in Wales
and Ireland.
McLeod said that players would still be able to earn money from off-field
activities and he expected that there were some members of the Scotland squad
who would be able to make around #40,000 in total this season.
The SRU - which yesterday dismissed as ``lies'' some newspaper reports
suggesting that the contract banned players' wives and girlfriends from trips -
is still exploring additional means of raising the extra revenue required to
pay the new breed of professional players.
``In the short term the money is not available but we have a variety of
commercial opportunities available to us. We are not, though, as some reports
have suggested, in dire financial straits and we are still examining the
possibilities.''
McLeod seemed to indicate initially that European Cup cash might enter the
equation but then qualified that by saying that it would, indeed, go primarily
to the clubs who supplied players for European competition.
There was, he said, a limit to what they could do with Murrayfield ticket
prices and the clubs had already indicated that they did not want prices to
rise. The possibility of a sponsor's logo on the Scotland shirt, however,
remained a possibility.
``That will not be given away for a small sum, though. Any potential sponsor
would have to pay an appropriate amount and at the moment nobody has offered a
sum which is acceptable.
``However, Famous Grouse, as the team sponsor, have certain options which they
have a right to take up

at the right price. It would be difficult to offer it to anybody else,'' said
McLeod.
One unfortunate player who will not figure in the new deal is the Currie hooker
Graham Ellis. He was scheduled to sit on the bench for the Western Samoan game
but was injured in training just a couple of days beforehand.
``The money has to go to players who were on the field or on the bench on the
day. Regrettably Graham Ellis is an unfortunate casualty through force of
circumstance,'' said McLeod.
Players who have been offered contracts are: Gary Armstrong (Jed-Forest), Paul
Burnell (London Scottish), Stewart Campbell (Dundee HS FP), Craig Chalmers
(Melrose), Damian Cronin (Bourges), Michael Dods (Northampton), Jim Hay
(Hawick), Scott Hastings (Watsonians), David Hilton (Bath), Ian Jardine
(Stirling County), Craig Joiner (Melrose), Kenny Logan (Stirling County), Kevin
McKenzie (Stirling County), Eric Peters (Bath), Bryan Redpath (Melrose), Stuart
Reid (Boroughmuir), Rowen Shepherd (Melrose), Graham Shiel (Melrose), Ian Smith
(Gloucester), Gregor Townsend (Northampton), Rob Wainwright (West Hartlepool),
Doddie Weir (Melrose), Peter Wright (Boroughmuir).

Descending
from summit
Charlie Woods, chief executive of Scotland Europa, examines the second report
from the Competitiveness Advisory Group which was established by European
leaders at last December's summit in Essen
THIS month's summit in Madrid was dominated by major issues covering the
expansion of the EU into Eastern Europe, Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and
next year's Inter Government Conference (IGC) to review the Maastricht Treaty
on European Union.
At the summit, leaders agreed on a name for the single currency (the Euro) and
reaffirmed the commitment that a single currency would be launched on January
1, 1999, between those countries that were ready and who had not opted out.
The summit also agreed to begin enlargement negotiations in early 1998,
although the precise details were a little vague. Agreement was also reached on
starting the IGC in Turin on March 29 next year.
Also on the summit agenda was the second report from       the Competitiveness
Advisory Group which was established by European leaders at last December's
summit in Essen. This group was given the remit to investigate the
competitiveness of European industry and to advise European leaders what they
could do to improve it, particularly in relation to the USA and Japan. The
group is chaired by former Italian Prime Minister Carlos Ciampi and its members
include David Simon, chairman of BP.
The Ciampi group report submitted to the Madrid summit makes interesting
reading and its recommendations are as fundamental to the peace and prosperity
of Europe as the other headline-grabbing issues at Madrid. The danger is that
it will not get the attention it deserves.
The report's main recommendation is that priority has to be given to improving
Europe's transport, power and telecoms infrastructure. This involves extending
the single market as quickly as possible to cover utilities, transport and
telecoms and ensuring that genuine European-wide competition exists in these
sectors.
The report sees greater competition as essential to boosting investment and
efficiency. Without this Europe's infrastructure is likely to act as a
constraint on the ability of companies in Europe to compete in the global
market place.
The completion of the single market still has some way to go. At the moment
full liberalisation of voice telephony is planned for 1998 and an opening up of
domestic airline routes to outside carriers is planned for 1997. However,
attempts to open up energy markets are on hold because of French reluctance to
act.
Further work is also required to ensure that even when a free market exists in
theory it also exists in practice. In some countries there are still many
elements of the single market that have already been agreed yet have still to
be implemented in full.
Denmark, with 96% of the legislation implemented is the best performer, while
Greece, with only 80% implemented, is the worst. Some areas of legislation are
also worse than others, eg only 51% of the public procurement legislation has
been implemented across the EU.
As well as freeing up markets, a competitive infrastructure also requires that
the necessary investment is made in the trans-European networks. These are the
key transport links across Europe that have been identified by the EU to speed
movement of goods and people throughout Europe and improve the functioning of
the single market. At the moment there are delays in agreeing funding for some
key projects which is holding up progress.
To improve competitiveness the Ciampi group report also identified the need for
improved links between new and developing businesses and sources of finance,
along with more effective schemes involving companies, teaching institutions
and unions to bring about a culture of lifelong learning and better equip
people for job mobility. They have already indicated that they will look at
skills issues further in their third report.
Practical measures which genuinely improve the functioning of the single
market, which provide Europe with a modern infrastructure, which help give
entrepreneurs the space and means to grow new businesses and which make the
most of the talents, skills and experience of Europe's citizens will have as
great an impact on the prosperity of Western Europen as many other issues under
discussion at the moment.
The competitive advantage from such measures will help European firms compete
with the best in the world. They will also give the EU the confidence to
further champion the removal of barriers to trade across the world. The
economic vitality they will engender will also give the EU the wherewithal to
more enthusiastically embrace the emerging democracies in eastern and central
Europe.
In a world dominated by what happens at the summit, the importance of the base
camp should not be overlooked.

ALEC Stewart looks set to carry on opening for England after arguing his case
at the crease for four hours yesterday.
Vice-captain Stewart responded to speculation that he might be dropped down to
No.3 for next week's fourth Test by scoring an unbeaten 89 against the South
African Students at Pietermaritzburg.
``I'm not fussed where I bat but I'm not one for making a change for the sake
of it,'' he said after an innings containing a 6, twelve 4s plus plenty of care
and concentration.
Stewart was not prepared to take too many chances yesterday. When he wafted
outside off stump early on, his body language indicated real annoyance and no
one was more disappointed to see play called off soon after tea because of
torrential rain.
It seems as though new recruit Jason Gallian will find himself filling
England's ``jinxed'' No.3 spot at Port Elizabeth next week, despite having made
only three runs from that position yesterday.
Manager Ray Illingworth and captain Mike Atherton could promote either Robin
Smith or Graeme Hick, but appear reluctant to consider either option. Here,
Atherton outscored Stewart during a first-wicket stand of 86 before top-edging
an attempted sweep against fourth Test candidate Nicky Boje two balls after
completing a half-century.
Following Gallian's dismissal, Graham Thorpe - twice dropped at slip - shared a
stand of 84 with his Surrey team-mate until rain ended proceedings with England
186 for two in reply to the Students' 269 for eight declared.

qAUSTRALIA were in record-breaking mood at the Sydney Cricket Ground yesterday
as they beat Sri Lanka by five wickets with two balls to spare in their World
Series match.
Michael Bevan hammered a boundary off the fourth ball of the final over to lift
the Australians to their third successive victory in the triangular tournament.
Chasing Sri Lanka's 50-over 255 for nine, Australia scored 257 for five, the
highest winning total for a side batting second in a one-day international on
the ground.
Australia captain Mark Taylor laid the foundations with a methodical 90 off 115
balls before being run out in the forty-first over.
Australia lead the competition with six points, four ahead of Sri Lanka, who
have played two games. West Indies have lost their opening three games.

REPUBLIC of Ireland football officials will embark today on what many in the
country consider an impossible task - replacing Jack Charlton as manager of the
national team.
The former England defender resigned as the Republic's manager yesterday,
ending a memorable reign spanning almost 10 years, and which took in two World
Cups.
Speculation over his successor - a talking point since the defeat by Holland in
a European Championship qualifying play-off eight days ago sparked strong
rumours that Charlton would quit - immediately went into overdrive.
Bookies' favourite Mick McCarthy said he was ``flattered'' at being linked with
the job, while first division Millwall confirmed they would give the Football
Association of Ireland permission to talk to their manager.
But the former Republic defender is just one name in a catalogue of reported
candidates, which also includes Blackburn director of football Kenny Dalglish,
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, his assistant Brian Kidd, Wimbledon's
Joe Kinnear, and former internationals Kevin Moran and Liam Brady.
The FAI would only comment on the man who led them to victory in 46 of his 93
games in charge - only 17 of which ended in defeat - and their praise was
lavish.
``Jack has steered our team to levels of success never before achieved,'' said
president Louis Kilcoyne. ``In doing this, he has helped to expand the game
into every corner of Ireland in a way which could hardly have been predicted 10
years ago.''
Charlton, who spoke to his bosses for 45 minutes before announcing his
decision, said: ``I have been walking around with a lump in my throat these
past two weeks. That lump has now gone. I am 60 now. It's time for someone
else. They have been a magnificent 10 years. Why spoil it all now?
``The country is in my blood now and I intend to spend a lot of time here in
the future among my friends. It was a dreadfully difficult decision to make,
but I felt it was in the best interest of the Irish team.''
Charlton's name will go down the history books. Republic midfielder Roy Keane
commented: ``I think everyone should give him a pat on the back because he has
done a fantastic job. Everbody knows that when Jack took the job nine years
ago, no-one had really heard of the Republic of Ireland as a footballing
nation, but now it is the No.1 sport in Ireland and obviously Jack and his team
are known all over the world.
Amid claims by supporters that the FAI had ousted Charlton, Kilcoyne confirmed:
``We will start our whole selection process within the next few days and hope
to have a manager appointed by the time we go to Liechtenstein for our World
Cup fixtures meeting in late January.

THIEVES are on the run with a sheepdog which has starred in farming adverts and
is said to be worth #1000.
Sam, a three-year-old smooth-coated collie, was stolen while owner Tom Jones of
Trefeddian Farm, Aberdyfi, Gwynedd, took a tea-break on his farm. ``I was only
in the house for a quarter-of-an-hour and when I came back he had gone,'' he
said.
Police and farmers' organisations warned of a series of thefts. At least 10
dogs have disappeared so far this winter in the Aberdyfi and Bala areas of
North Wales. Some have also gone missing in North Ceredigion.
Melvyn Harrison, a regional official for AGF Insurance, said: ``With the
current spate of thefts, we would urge farmers to take extra care, locking up
their dogs safe at night and making sure they do not stray during the day.''

q TRAINER Kim Bailey is not hoping for a white Christmas as he seeks to get
Master Oats back on the winning road.
The Gold Cup victor is pencilled in for next Thursday's Ericsson Chase at
Leopardstown as he tries to redeem a reputation tarnished by an inexplicable
flop at Chepstow earlier in the month.
But should wintry weather force the abandonment of Kempton's King George
programme on Boxing Day, Master Oats will challenge Merry Gale in the
three-mile Ericsson Chase.
Other possible rivals to Master Oats include the Galway Plate winner, Life of a
Lord, and last season's Greenalls Gold Cup winner, Nuaffe.
Bailey is still at a loss to explain Master Oats' poor performance in
Chepstow's Rehearsal Chase, when he was pulled up three out.

WHEN it comes to indoor hockey, the Scandinavian countries leave Britain
standing, particularly in the men's game.
They will be represented by Stockholm (Sweden) and Slagelse (Denmark) in the
finals in Vienna on February 16 to 18 of the European Club Championship, while
the Dundee side, Insights Menzieshill, will be the sole British representatives.
The Scottish champions have been placed in the stronger of the two groups, but
their coach, Harry Byres, at least will take some comfort from the order of
play.
The tournament organisers, WAC Vienna, see Menzieshill as the most likely
challengers in their group to last season's beaten finalists Pocztowiec with
the result the two teams will meet in the third and final series of group
matches.
This will give the Taysiders the chance to seal their place in the semi-finals
before they come up against the Poznan based Polish champions, as their two
other opponents, CD Terassa (Spain) and Bohemians Prague (Czech Republic), do
not appear to be in the same class as the Poles.
These two games will be played on the first of the three-day event with the
Terassa encounter likely to give them a perfect start to their campaign.
Unfortunately, the domestic season is not geared to Menzieshill's venture into
Europe and their quest for a medal. The league campaign is now over and they
have only a maximum of three cup-ties remaining.
The Taysiders, however, have arranged their own seven-team round-robin
tournament at the Dick McTaggart centre in Dundee on December 27 to 29, and
then, along with MIM, they will contest the DTZ Midlands international
invitation tournament at Kidderminster on January 6 and 7 to help them prepare
for the more demanding assignments that lie ahead.

RANGERS midfielder Alexei Mikhailichenko is set to join Wolverhampton Wanderers
in a #500,000 transfer deal. The clubs have agreed terms and it is now up to
the 31-year-old Ukrainian internationalist to decide his future.
Last night Wolves' new manager, Mark McGhee, said: ``Everything has been worked
out with Rangers. I want Alexei here, but at the moment I don't know when that
will happen. I may travel to Glasgow in the morning or I may wait and have him
down to look around Molineux next midweek.
``I don't want to rush things and throw him into the team for Saturday with no
preparation.
``He's the kind of player I need to turn this club round. I am sure he can do
that, especially as I am bringing in other players already.''
McGhee has taken Vinny Samways on loan from Everton and will finalise his
signing early in the new year, and last night he was agreeing a #1m deal for
Queen's Park Rangers midfielder Simon Osborne.
Mikhailichenko made only a handful of appearances for Rangers last season and
this year it has been the same story. His appearances have been few, although
he did play at Fir Park on Tuesday night in the 0-0 draw with Motherwell.
He joined Rangers four years ago from Sampdoria in a #2m deal. At that time he
was captain of the Russian national side and joined up to be alongside his
team-mate from Dynamo Kiev, Oleg Kuznetsov.
Now Mikhailichenko, always a favourite with the fans in spite of his infrequent
first-team appearances, is poised to leave. His contract at Ibrox ends in the
summer and this move by Wolves will suit the Ibrox club and should suit the
player, too.
Wolves are certain to move upwards under the guidance of McGhee and
Mikhailichenko can become part of that revival.

IMPROVING chaser Lo Stregone, a probable absentee from the Welsh National, is
set to test the mettle of Jodami on Boxing Day.
Trainer Tom Tate admitted yesterday the weather would play a part in the next
assignment for the nine-year-old, but at present his preferred option is to
stay close to home and tackle Wetherby's Rowland Meyrick Chase, where the
top-weight is 1993 Gold Cup hero Jodami.
``We definitely intend to run either at Wetherby or Chepstow, but who knows
what's going to happen as the weather forecast is poor,'' he said.
Unless top-weight Miinnehoma is a defector Lo Stregone will have to race from
out of the handicap in the Welsh National on Wednesday. ``We don't think that
he will be suited by a slogging match at Chepstow, and assuming both meetings
went ahead, the choice would be Wetherby, even though it looks a hot race,''
said Tate.
Lo Stregone appears to have progressed this season, judged on his defeat at
Wetherby last time of Unguided Missile, who has since gone on to land the
Betterware Cup at Ascot.
q FROST, which put paid to yesterday's scheduled cards at Uttoxeter and Kelso,
looks the main threat to Boxing Day's busy programme.
A spell of milder weather is in the offing today and tomorrow, but the clerks
of the 10 courses scheduled to race on Boxing Day will be keeping a keen eye on
conditions with the Met office predicting a spell of colder weather on
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day night.
Mark Kershaw, secretary at Ayr (Tuesday) and Edinburgh (Wednesday), gloomily
reported: ``We could not have raced at either course today because of frost. We
are just going to have to sit and wait until Sunday night before looking
again.''
q CONDITIONAL jockey Guy Lewis is to step into Diane Clay's recently hung up
riding boots and ride for Bill Clay.
Lewis, 21, who claims 3lb and has ridden eight winners this season, is
delighted that his agreement with Clay will allow him to continue his
association with Paul Nicholls and Milton Bradley.
He rode Viaggio to victory at Southwell on Tuesday, a result which both ended a
173-day drought for Clay and prompted the Stoke trainer to offer Lewis the
contract.
q JOCKEY David Bridgwater takes time off from his title tussle with Tony McCoy
today to get married. He and fiance Lucy Phelps-Brown will tie the knot in the
Cotswolds and spend their honeymoon and Christmas in Rome.
The couple were introduced three years ago by amateur jockey Alex
Charles-Jones, who is to be best man.
``It was a blind date really,'' said Lucy. ``Alex is a mutual friend and David
had told him he wanted to meet a girl who knew nothing about racing and would
like him for what he was.
``Alex put us together at a dinner party. My first thought was who was this
funny little man, but we really hit it off.
``I've ridden horses myself and done some eventing, but the only two names in
racing I knew were Lester Piggott and Willie Carson.
``Since going out with David I've had a real crash course in racing.''

n THE Public Accounts Committee expressed concern about Scottish Enterprise's
representatives on the HCI board.
It stated that it was surprised the board did not meet more frequently than
once every three or four months, and added that it was ``especially concerned''
that the board members appointed by Scottish Enterprise did not attend all of
these meetings.
While it was taking evidence, the committee heard that the first representative
was Mr John Laydon. He was Scottish Enterprise's HCI director for only a few
months and attended one meeting - in February, 1992, - before being given leave
of absence to join HCI as director of international marketing, a post he held
for less than a year before returning to Scottish Enterprise.
Mr Laydon, currently on secondment to the Scottish Financial Enterprise
organisation which promotes the interests of Scotland's financial community,
declined to comment on the report last night.
He was succeeded as Scottish Enterprise's HCI director by Mr Donald Patience.
Mr Patience, who died last month, was widely regarded as a brilliant operator
in the field of equity investment in his years at Scottish Enterprise and its
predecessor body, the Scottish Development Agency. He left Scottish Enterprise
in May, 1993, for various consultancy posts but continued to act as Scottish
Enterprise's nominee on the HCI board.
The committee said Mr Patience had attended only four HCI board meetings during
the 22 months between September 1992 and July 1994, but it was told in evidence
that all meetings, ``with the possible exception of three'', had been attended.
The committee asked Scottish Enterprise why Mr Laydon, after he had become
international marketing director, had not communicated the failures of the
international marketing effort to Mr Patience.
But the agency said it had its own director on the HCI board, ie Mr Patience,
and that marketing and other reports flowed through him to the agency.
Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, told the
committee that he was satisfied that Mr Patience had represented the agency's
interests adequately and properly.

BTURKEY goes to the polls on Christmas Eve in an election seen as crucial for
the country's future. For the first time in the 71-year history of the Turkish
Republic, a serious challenge to the legacy of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of
the state, is being mounted.
It comes from the Welfare Party, a pro-Islamic force intent on reversing the
secular and pro-Western course Turkey has been on since the era of the Ottoman
sultans ended after 1918.
In the 1920s, Turkey witnessed one of the great revolutions of the century,
which has proved more enduring than that attempted by Lenin in Russia. Ataturk
drove all foreign forces from Turkish soil and then made a radical break with
the Ottoman past and Islamic civilisation and culture.
Religious schools were abolished, the Arabic script was replaced by the Latin
alphabet, and women were emancipated as furious efforts were made to create a
modern state on the European model. Turkish nationalism became the new
ideology, with Ataturk himself as the father of the nation.
A colossal personality cult surrounds Ataturk, whose martial expression stares
down at Turks from statues and portraits throughout that sprawling land. He
undoubtedly saved the country from extinction but, for the first time, his
doctrine of Kemalism is being challenged openly by forces who argue that Turkey
can only move forward if it is in harmony with its religious roots.
The seeds of the Islamic revival were planted in the 1980s by Turgut Ozal who,
by the time of his death in 1993, was widely seen as the most important Turkish
leader since Ataturk.
He moved a state-run, centralised economy towards a market system, unleashing a
torrent of social change. Between 1981 and 1992 the economy grew at between 6%
and 8% (except in 1991, the year of the Gulf war), the highest rate in the West
except for Japan. A huge influx of peasants into the cities occurred so that
Istanbul and Ankara soon contained one-quarter of the population.
Ozal also seized the opportunities brought by the collapse of Soviet power to
turn Turkey into a regional power. The new states of former Soviet Central Asia
were encouraged to look to Turkey as a protector on account of shared culture
and language. Turkey also promoted economic links between the states bordering
the Black Sea and played a key role in the Gulf war.
But the economy was stretched by runaway inflation and one of the highest
external debts in the world. The chaotic boom left many social casualties and
huge infrastructural problems in cities whose populations doubled and then
trebled in the space of a decade.
Peasants tried to make sense of their lives in the strange big city by
increasingly turning to Islam. The Welfare Party, financed by Saudi Arabia and
committed to restoring Islamic law and rolling back secularism, captured their
loyalties.
In 1993, the secular middle-classes received a shock when it won local
elections in Istanbul and Ankara. But the lack of any credible alternative, as
much as its religious message, explains the success of radical Islam.
Personality disputes have split the centre-right while the radical left has
been shipwrecked by the fall of communism. Between 1993 and this summer, a
fragile coalition of left and right-of-centre parties was presided over by Mrs
Tansu Ciller.
In the macho world of Turkey, women enjoy surprising influence in professional
life and the elevation of Ciller was probably greeted with less surprise than
that of Mrs Thatcher here in the 1970s.

<TEXT>
THE son of a transport union leader travelled by train to rob banks and
building societies throughout the country, police said yesterday.
Matthew Loughlin - the son of Rail, Maritime, and Transport Union president Don
Loughlin - became known as The Anorak Man because he pulled the hood of his
coat over his face to hide his identity during a two-and-a-half-year robbery
spree.
Loughlin, 37, of Mount Street, Derby, was captured by transport policeman John
Dickinson, who recognised him from a security photograph taken during one raid,
as he stood next to him on a railway platform.
Loughlin's holdall was found to contain a replica gun and #1600 from a robbery
he had committed in Wakefield.
Yesterday, at Sheffield Crown Court, Loughlin admitted 11 robberies, one
attempted robbery, and one firearms offence. He also asked for four robberies
and an attempted robbery to be taken into consideration.
He denied a further nine charges, which were ordered to lie on the file.
Judge Alan Goldsack adjourned the case for reports until January 26, remanding
Loughlin in custody.
Police described Loughlin as a Mr Average, who they believe could have been
responsible for up to 84 offences, involving up to #100,000.
He confessed to robberies in Nottingham, Long Eaton, Tamworth, Sheffield,
Doncaster, Newark, Crewe, Grantham, and Wakefield, between July 1992 and
October 1994, which brought in #17,000.
After the hearing, Detective Inspector Chris Barnfather - who co-ordinated
Operation Trojan which involved 12 police forces hunting Loughlin - said the
former public schoolboy had turned to crime four months after losing his job as
a British Rail fitter.
``He was given #13,000 redundancy money and spent it very quickly. Effectively,
he went out to steal to maintain his lifestyle,'' Mr Barnfather claimed.
``If he got a good haul, we didn't get a robbery for a month. If it was a small
amount, we got another a couple of days later. It was his income.''
Mr Barnfather said that immediately after a robbery, Loughlin, who used the
money to buy cars, motorcycles, holidays, and presents for his girlfriend,
would go shopping.
On January 31, 1994, Loughlin raided the Midland Bank in Doncaster and the
Coventry Building Society in Sheffield, stealing #5855, and also tried to rob a
Sheffield branch of Midland Bank.
Loughlin - a Star Trek enthusiast - then returned to Derby and bought a
Vauxhall Cavalier for #5000.
The officers tracking The Anorak Man discovered that he had travelled around by
train when they found a left luggage locker he was using at Derby Central
Station which contained lots of used rail tickets.
Loughlin's parents, who are said to be ``very close'' to him, were in court
yesterday but refused to comment.

waiving his right to contest extradition.
He was sentenced to jail on other theft offences at York Crown Court on

A BID is being made to bring the Royal yacht Britannia to Glasgow when the
vessel is decommissioned in 1997.
City architect Geoffrey Jarvis has applied to the Cabinet Office to sail the
yacht up the Clyde one last time and give it a permanent home in a dry dock
next to the former Garden Festival site.
Mr Jarvis believes his plan for Britannia would help boost tourism in the city.
He said: ``This would be a tourism Mecca.''
Clydebank District Council is one of more than a dozen other organisations
which have applied to the Cabinet Office to give Britannia a home.
Chief executive Jim McNally said two sites had been proposed as a location for
the vessel, one opposite the HCI hospital and another near Rothesay Dock, where
the ship was built.
He expressed doubts about the viability of the Glasgow bid for the yacht. ``I
am not a marine specialist but I would have thought it was extremely difficult
to organise because of the depth of the water.''
Britannia was built at Clydebank and launched in 1953. It is due to come out of
service in 1997, when the Government is also expected to announce if a
replacement is to be built.
A Cabinet Office spokesman declined to comment on individual applications for
the Britannia. He said: ``We have received between 12 and 20 bids and we are
expecting a decision in the new year.''
Mr Jarvis is a director of The Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 Ltd, which made an
unsuccessful bid for Millennium Fund money to give the derelict garden festival
land a facelift.
Site owner Glasgow Development Agency is also bidding for Millennium funding
for its own plans for a National Science Centre on the land.
Announcements on the latest round of Millennium fund projects are expected
today.

Peshawar, Thursday.   A CAR bomb exploded outside a department store in the
northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar today, killing at least 32 people and
wounding 117, doctors and witnesses said.
Hospital doctors said they feared the death toll could rise as some of the
wounded were in critical condition.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, described by
Prime Minister Benzir Bhutto as terrorism, and authorities said they did not
know who carried it out.
Provincial police chief Masood Shah said he suspected an Afghan group because
of a series of recent smaller blasts in the region for which he blamed Afghans.
Peshawar has a large population of Afghan refugees from the war that has raged
in neighbouring Afghanistan since 1979.
Police said the bomb went off in a busy street in Peshawar's Saddar Bazaar
district at 6.30pm when the area was crowded with shoppers ahead of the Muslim
weekend tomorrow.
Government officials said at least 27 people were killed but hospital doctors
said the toll had risen to 31 after recovery of more victims from the Wadood
Sons department store.
Bhutto denounced the bombing as terrorism and said in a statement that ``the
culprits will not go unpunished and every effort will be made to bring them to
book''.
The blast set several cars on fire and wrecked nearby shops.
``I cannot say right now who was responsible,'' Aftab Sherpao, Chief Minister
of North West Frontier Province, of which Peshawar is the capital, told
reporters at the scene. ``We will fully investigate.''
A senior police official said the blast appeared to have been caused by a 55lb
time bomb. ``This is the worst bomb here for a long time,'' said the official,
Ghulam Hussain.
A suicide car bomb wrecked the Egyptian embassy in the Pakistani capital
Islamabad on November 19, killing 16 people and wounding more than 60.
The Muslim militant group Jihad, one of three Egyptian organisations which
claimed responsibility for the embassy blast, warned Pakistan last week to stop
extraditing militants to Egypt.
``We warn the government of Pakistan that it will pay a heavy price if it
continues to hand over Islamists living on its territory,'' said a December 14
statement signed by the Vanguard of the Conquest in Egypt, a revival of the
Jihad group which assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
Egypt and Pakistan signed an extradition treaty in July 1994. Islamabad says it
has extradited 10 of the 11 people wanted by Cairo. The 11th is on the run.
There was no immediate evidence to link Jihad with today's blast.-Reuter

The Scottish Office and Scottish Enterprise have been criticised for failing to
do their homework. Stephen McGregor reports
FEW of those concerned with the setting up of the controversial HCI hospital
project in Clydebank escape criticism in the damning report on the handling of
investment published yesterday by the powerful Commons public accounts
committee.
Starting with the confirmation that there has been an outright loss to the
taxpayer of #8.4m, it strongly criticises both the Scottish Office Industry
Department and Scottish Enterprise and states bluntly: ``We consider that all
concerned should have taken a tighter grip on this project.''
The committee, which monitors how public money is spent, conducted a lengthy
inquiry into the multi-million pound project, which went into receivership
after only four months.
On the positive side, the committee notes that following the sale of the
business to HCI Holdings, the hospital is continuing to function, that its new
backers have provided #20m, and that the department will release a further
#4.4m in Regional Selective Assistance when 400 jobs have been maintained for
at least three months.
It also notes that projections indicate the business will get close to
providing the 1800 jobs originally envisaged, and that the new owners are
prepared to give it ``some years'' to break into profitability, mainly in
overseas markets.
Elsewhere, however, the conclusions are overwhelmingly critical. The committee
makes clear that the majority of the #37m spent on the project was provided in
the form of Regional Selective Assistance and that the department did not
regard this as a loss because there now was a well-equipped hospital in being
which was providing jobs.
However, the committee states: ``We are nevertheless disturbed that so much
public money was spent in support of a project undertaken by a company which
went into receivership only months after the building had opened for business,
that there has been an outright loss to the taxpayer of #8.4m, and that the
hospital is operating at a level much below that envisaged when public funds
were committed.
``We consider the whole scheme should have been initiated on a less ambitious
scale if it were to attract public funds.''
The committee notes that only 761 people were treated in the hospital's first
four months, many from the National Health Service, and describes the
expectation that there would be a throughput of 5000 patients a year from the
private sector as ``wildly optimistic''.
It says there should have been analyses of the sensitivity of the project to
varying levels of market success and adds: ``Assumptions about patient numbers
are crucial to assessments of the viability of projects like these, and we are
concerned that neither of the two appraisals of this project carried out by
public-sector bodies addressed the hospital's market prospects.
``We consider the department placed too much reliance on assessments carried
out by others, who may have had differing reasons for investing in the project.
Given the gap between projected and actual patient numbers we question whether
the department carried out a sufficiently rigorous review of the appraisals of
others.''
The committee notes evidence from the Scottish Office Industry Department that
risk is involved with all Regional Selective Assistance, but it states that in
this case the risks were ``major''. HCI as a company had no experience of
running a hospital, let alone one that would depend for its success on a
little-tried patient referral system and which would operate novel prescribing
arrangements that would need to be validated.
The committee states: ``We consider the department's evaluation of the risks
was insufficiently thorough. In addition we are concerned to note that only
three of the 12 members of the Scottish Industry Development Advisory Board
positively supported the grant of RSA to this project.''
Pursuing the point on RSA, the committee notes that this was given to HCI in
part to compensate the company for its VAT liability on construction costs.
However, it says the company then managed to spread #10.4m of the liability
over 10 years and so far had avoided paying any of it. ``We consider it
unsatisfactory that the additional RSA was not similarly phased.''
The committee also expresses concern that #9.4m was spent on providing a site
for the hospital on land which was known to be heavily contaminated. ``We are
disturbed that it is not yet entirely clear of gas seepage and look to Scottish
Enterprise to conclude successfully their claim against the contractor
responsible.''
On the monitoring of HCI's operations, the committee says that in the light of
the increasingly serious problems of the HCI project it is surprised that its
board did not meet more often than every three or four months. It states: ``We
are especially concerned that the board member appointed by Scottish
Enterprise, and his successor, did not attend all of these meetings. As a
result Scottish Enterprise and the department were not kept fully in the
picture about the project's growing    difficulties.
``We are particularly disturbed that the nominee director failed to alert them
to HCI's worsening cash position until April 1994 when he had known about it
for some time. It is also unsatisfactory that the Scottish Enterprise and the
department were not sufficiently aware, until the hospital was coming on
stream, that there had been marketing shortcomings, notably in Greece and
Italy. ``As marketing was critical to the project's success and as the
department did not see the marketing reports available to Scottish Enterprise,
we regard this as a serious failing.
``We consider that all concerned should have taken a tighter grip on this
project and we note the department's acceptance that they need to deal better
with projects where the leadership is not clear.
``This is an important lesson for the future. We consider that it was for the
department to ensure that a nominee director was able to fulfil his duties as a
board member involved in the oversight of a large sum of public money, the
effectiveness of which was increasingly in question.''
In conclusion, the committee notes the department's view that they would
ultimately be judged by whether the project was successful, free-standing,
making money, and providing good patient care, and that the end of the decade
would probably be the right time to reach a judgment. It adds, however: ``We
consider that, in the meantime, they should set about implementing the lessons
we have drawn attention to.''

A FIRE chief has been cleared of allegations involving a female firefighter and
is to return to his post.
Mr George Fraser, 54, the officer in charge of Duns Fire Station, in the
Borders, was cleared by a special tribunal of failing to deal effectively with
sexual harassment claims made by the station's first woman fire officer, Mrs
Sharon McKenzie, 23.
He was cleared of nine allegations, which also included accusations of neglect
of duty.
His lawyer, Ms Shona Simon, said: ``The majority of these charges were in fact
based on the allegations that he failed to exercise sufficient management
control rather than suggesting that he himself had been involved in any alleged
misconduct.''
Mr Fraser had also said he was willing to undergo counselling ordered by fire
chiefs for both him and Mrs McKenzie before returning to his job.
The chairman of the joint Lothian and Borders fire board, Councillor Bill Axon,
said both firefighters were free to return to their posts.
Mrs McKenzie has been on special leave from the brigade since the claims
emerged in September last year.
A second fireman, Mr Ronnie Burnett, 34, is reported to have been reprimanded
for using threatening behaviour, while charges against a third man, Mr Andrew
Burns, 33, have been dropped.
Mr Axon said the tribunal had concluded there was no case to answer on any
charge of a sexual nature.
It is the first case of sexual harrassment to be handled by the brigade, which
has nine women fire officers.

The troubles ahead for the two princes
are assessed by Jennifer Cunningham
ALTHOUGH the Queen believes a swift divorce would put an end to some of the
problems caused by the unresolved separation of the Prince and Princess of
Wales, it is probably not be the best option for her grandsons.
There is rare agreement among psychologists that divorce is painful for
children whatever the circumstances which have led up to it.
``Divorce is not terrific news for these boys,'' confirmed Laura Galbraith,
co-ordinator of psychology services for children in Fife. Their first problem
is that they are boys. There has been a belated recognition of boys' greater
vulnerability. ``One of the things we do know is that boys tend to be more
affected than girls by their parents divorcing,'' she said.
Particular factors, however, can improve things. One is a very good
relationship with one parent or a good relationship with another adult, such as
a teacher or grandparent.
Despite the public aspects of this particular split, we don't know a lot about
the quality of the individual parent-child relationships but it is difficult to
see any of the three surviving grandparents stepping into the void.
Another negative factor is that although divorce is the final legal step in a
process already under way, there is no avoiding it being played out in public.
Being at boarding school could be an advantage or disadvantage. ``It may be
that the information does not come to them directly from their parents and it
may be difficult for them to check it with the people they are most emotionally
attached to, although there may be other protective factors,'' said Ms
Galbraith.
Princes William and Harry can expect support from their schoolfriends. Ms
Brenda Robson, a chartered psychologist specialising in child and family work
for the courts in cases where custody and access are disputed, is a school
counsellor in a boarding school. She runs groups there for children who are
going through the turmoil of parental divorce and finds that they will often
give each other tips about how to cope.
``It is very helpful for a child who is at the height of the emotional battle
to speak to a boy who went through it two years ago and to see that he has
managed to keep a relationship going with both parents,'' she said. She thinks
it is likely that 25% of the boys at the princes' schools will have experienced
divorce.
``Divorce is always a painful experience for children, even when the parents
are handling it in the most civilised manner. If the people happen to be well
known and in the public eye with a lot of acrimony going on in public, it is
particularly traumatic,'' said Margaret McAllister, a child psychologist in
Lothian region and secretary of the Scottish branch of the British
Psychological Society.
She suggests there may be some parallels, despite the different culture, with
the case of Macaulay Culkin's parents in the US, another high-profile example,
which Mrs McAllister describes as ``an upside down case where the child is the
gold mine''.
The boarding school life combined with the variety of houses at their disposal
will avoid the humiliation of a battle royal over custody and access but it
seems the luckless little princes will be fought over one way or another by the
adults.
Being scrupulously even-handed and avoiding criticism of the other parent is
enormously difficult, according to Laura Galbraith, who describes it as ``an
arena fraught with difficulty even when parents start out with good
intentions''.

THE article concerning parking in Glasgow (December 9) struck a painful chord
with me. The day before, while visiting my daughter in the Royal Infirmary, I
received a ticket for parking in enclosed ground which is described as Stirling
Road, opposite the old hospital. I was only just in time to prevent my car
being impounded - others were not so lucky.
This area, partly used as a taxi-rank, allows free parking all down one side
except, according to a policeman, for a small part at the south end where there
is space for some four cars. There are double yellow lines at this point which
seem very old and would appear to be remnants of the former use of the road.
Within minutes of the arrival of the policeman, there were three transporters
there to remove these vehicles.
The point is, what has the removal of these cars got to do with ``keeping the
traffic flowing''? Why were these officers not in the city where their
employment might have been more useful?

THE conduct of the Scottish Office and of Scottish Enterprise in the affair of
the Health Care International hospital at Clydebank was nothing short of a
disgrace. There should be apologies, and full ones at that. What we have had
instead is embarrassed silence and dissimulation. Scottish Office Minister
George Kynoch was put up yesterday to provide some sort of early excuse for
what went wrong. Although Mr Kynoch is not personally culpable his response
was, to use one of his own words, a disappointment.
The report into the shambles by the Commons Public Accounts Committee would
have to be reviewed ``very carefully'', he said. That should be a painful
exercise, bearing in mind that the report points out that the Scottish Office
Industry Department's evaluation of the risks was insufficiently thorough; that
the board of this limping enterprise met only every three or four months; that
Scottish Enterprise's nominated board member and his successor did not attend
all of the meetings and that as a result the Scottish Office and Scott
There is no point in mincing words here. Mr Ian Lang must carry a heavy
responsibility for this affair, especially as he continued with protestations
of confidence when it was abundantly clear that HCI was a disaster in the
making. He might ponder the Public Accounts Committee's conclusion that there
should have been a tighter grip on the project. Ultimately, that was Mr Lang's
task: he failed.

TYOUR editorial of December 19 on the Russian elections more than once
describes the victors as, in the same breath, ``the Communists and extreme
nationalists''. You also continue: ``The simple fact that the Government is
unpopular with the people, and that Russians have been able to register their
disapproval, is a sign that Russian democracy is working''.
The truth is more complex. It has been the Yeltsin Government that has pursued
a chauvinist war in Chechenya - with support from Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democrats. It has been the Russian Communist Party that has consistently led
the mass opposition to it.
It was the Yeltsin Government that bombarded the old Parliament in 1993. It was
the Communist Party which defended it.
It was Yeltsin who seized virtual dictatorial powers for the Presidency after
the dispersal of the previous Parliament. It is the Communists who today call
for  the restoration of powers to the Duma and, no less important, to local
elected bodies.
If there is mass support for the Communist Party in Russia, it is not because
it somehow represents dark forces of reaction. On the contrary, it is because
people see the Communists as the one organised force that stands between them
and a semi-dictatorial regime enforcing the most rapacious of capitalist values
and practices.
The scale of support for the Russian Communists should encourage socialists and
democrats everywhere.

UNDER a new scheme announced yesterday, travellers can complete payment of
their 1996 summer holidays months after they get back.
In an effort to boost the flagging holiday market, travel agent Lunn Poly is
launching an easy-to-pay plan.
From next Wednesday, the company is inviting holidaymakers to pay for their
summer 1996 breaks in up to four instalments. This means that a holiday booked
early next month need not be completely paid for until January 1997.
The instalment option is one of three being offered by Lunn Poly. The other two
are a 10% discount off summer 1996 brochure prices, or free insurance.
The company, and the rest of the travel industry, is hoping for a boost in
bookings in the vital post-Christmas period.
A lack of consumer confidence has caused bookings for summer 1996 to dip by as
much as 30% compared with this time last year.
Thomson, the UK's biggest holiday company, announced it was introducing a
``fluid pricing'' policy from next Wednesday that will mean reductions of up to
#100 per person off some holidays in the company's main summer 1996 brochures.
Early bookers will get discounts but those booking later will have to pay the
brochure price. Those who have already booked now-reduced holidays will still
get the discount

<TEXT>
THE four things the Princess of Wales will want defined in the divorce
settlement are her status, her income, how her wish to be a Queen of Hearts can
be met, and her future relationship with her children.
The negotiations about her future role began in the wake of her Panorama
interview and are likely to continue for some while yet. Although they arenot
part of the divorce settlement as such, are complementary to it.
The Queen's wish that the pair divorce gives them fresh impetus because it is
vital for the princess, even though she was refusing yesterday to respond
immediately to the Queen's request, that they move smoothly to a conclusion.
If she is seen to be being simply obstinate, especially given the Prince of
Wales's decision to do as his mother wants and his announcement that he will
not be marrying again, her image will be damaged and for the princess image is
all.
Her status. This is important because she is the mother of a man born to be
king and, if royalty means anything in British society, the mother of the king
must have the right social position. However, her future title is important to
the princess because it is what makes the former Lady Diana Spencer,
paradoxical though it may seem, a somebody in her own right.
After their divorce, she will cease to be Princess of Wales but she will want
to retain the title of Her Royal Highness. The royal family are jealous of the
title, which is not bestowed lightly, as the Duchess of Windsor found to her
cost and the fury of her husband. In this instance, it would seem rash to deny
the princess the right to remain an HRH, so HRH, Princess Diana it will very
probably be.
Income. Prince Charles is very wealthy but he is not actually as cash rich as
he is land rich - the Duchy of Cornwall owns around 133,000 acres, mostly in
the South-west of England, as well as shops and office buildings. Its assets
are said to be worth more than #90m, and his annual income from the duchy is
estimated at more than #3m.
He has no claim on the duchy's capital, however, which is held in trust for
future Princes of Wales. His income from the duchy estates - he does not
receive any money from the Civil List - is used to finance his household and
the performance of his public duties, but that still leaves him with around #2m
income to which she could lay claim. Were it an ordinary rich man she was
divorcing, she would probably seek a third of his income, or about #600,000 a
year.
If allowed to continue to play a role in public life, she will need enough
money to support her own household. A clean-break settlement would probably
have to total around #15m to allow her that sort of income and there is no way
the prince can come up with that kind of money. The Queen, however, wants the
divorce for the good of the family and can be expected to help.
Her future role. Princess Diana's expressed wish to be a queen of hearts cannot
be set aside. She may not be able to play the diplomatic role that she appears
to aspire to, as her visit to Argentina last month suggested she does, but
there is no reason why she should not prove a successful ambassador for Britain
on trips on behalf of her favourite charities.
The Princess Royal manages this, although with less attendant self-publicity,
in her work for the Save the Children Fund and, given the proper advice, there
is no reason why a divorced Princess Diana should not be able to do the same.
However, proper advice is the important factor, which brings us back to the
composition of her household and her finances.
If she is to remain part of the royal family firm, she has to be provided with
the right professional support to do her job, which costs money. Giving enough
money in the settlement to fund the role from her own resources might be the
easiest solution, although it would leave her in control of her advisers, which
may not be in the overall interests of the monarchy.
Clearly, since she is a media star the like of whom the Windsors have never
known, it would be foolish to jettison her completely. At the same time, she
cannot be allowed to compete for public attention and affection with her former
husband, whom she has upstaged regularly.
Access to her children. This is unlikely to present a major problem since in
this respect the divorce is really no different from any others. They are
expected to divorce by consent and are both self confessed adulterers, so,
there being no guilty party, as parents they would expect to have equal rights
of access.
As both princes will be at school for most of the year, it is primarily a
question of where they spend their holidays and there need be no arguments
about that. They will be expected to attend the grisly royal house parties at
Balmoral and Sandringham, their birthright, which could mean not seeing their
mother at certain times of the year, but the assurances required on sharing
their children fairly she and Prince Charles will seek will be no different
from those in any other divorce by consent.

IT was a long time coming but, after enduring frustration and anger to a degree
which we can only guess at, the Queen has taken action to bring some sort of
order to her unruly family. Her request that Prince Charles and Princess Diana
move quickly to a divorce is simple common sense. As an attempt to deal cleanly
with a situation which has deteriorated shockingly it can be received with no
emotion other than relief. Prince Charles will probably share that feeling.
Whatever his fitness to be King it is clear that he ardently wants the
position. What other explanation could there be for his announcement that he
will not remarry? He is well aware that the Church of England would have no
problem with crowning a divorced King but would baulk at one who had married a
divorcee or who was involved in extra-marital relationships. This would appear
to suggest that we could have a celibate Prince of Wales, or at least a very
careful one.
Princess Diana is less likely to be pleased and is obviously not prepared to be
bounced into making a quick decision. She has said that she does not want a
divorce and by holding her hand on a decision she has managed to retain the
initiative in a tricky situation. Most probably, though, she will have to agree
to the Queen's request. At this point her hold on the situation, and quite
likely on a good deal of the extraordinary fascination felt for her by the
public, could begin to drain away. She will have to cope with this as best she
can, although in common decency the royal family should do their best to ensure
that she retains a meaningful role in public life.
Although it is sad to admit as much, the royal family in all of this reflects
the difficulties many in our society face in sustaining marriage. There are a
variety of reasons for this and it would be wrong to attempt a facile analysis.
Nevertheless it is impossible to contemplate the present situation without
recognising the strains it will put on the young princes. Their parents come
from families which were either broken or which did not appear to enjoy much
love. In these circumstances behaviour patterns can be established which are
repeated later and we can only hope that this is not so in their lives. For his
part, Prince Charles may be seeing a good deal of his sister, Princess Anne. If
he pays close attention he may learn much to his advantage.

Alison Daniels looks at the project that was plagued by problems from the start
CONTROVERSY and heated debated surrounded every aspect of the conception,
planning, and building of the glitzy Health Care International hospital on the
unglamorous site of an old steelworks in Clydebank.
Just six months after opening, the project had met with financial disaster.
HCI, part funded by #37m of public money, was in the hands of the receivers
amid recriminations over the waste of taxpayers' cash.
Four months of negotiations with potential buyers saw a number of cliffhangers
before the hospital was finally saved when a deal was struck with the Middle
Eastern-based Abu Dhabi Investment Company.
But rescue did not mean the end of controversy. This year the hospital has come
under fire over the treatment of NHS patients, occupancy rates, revelations
about #220,000 roof repairs, and the departure of over 25 staff.
Yesterday, HCI's current management kept quite, distancing itself from
pre-receivership problems and pointing only to a recently signed contract with
the Algerian Government to treat around 300 heart patients and the steady
stream of patients, mainly from the Middle East, seen since February.
The long-term goals articulated over the past few months in measured terms by
Abu Dhabi Investment's chairman, Mr Harab Ali Darmaki, contrast all too sharply
with the picture of a thriving international 260-bed centre of medical
excellence painted by HCI's American founders, Dr Raphael Levey and Dr Angelo
Eraklis, when they unveiled their ambitious scheme in 1987.
Speaking in Glasgow eight years ago the former Harvard surgeons expressed
surprise at the hostility vented by health unions and MPs but promised to forge
ahead with the five-star hospital designed to cater for the wealthy foreigners
from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East if backed by the Government.
In October they got that backing when the then Scots Secretary, Malcolm
Rifkind, gave the official go-ahead for the hospital, attempting to soothe
misgivings over private health care with the promise of 4000 permanent jobs,
including 1800 at the hospital, for depressed Clydebank.
The decision met with almost universal condemnation. There were fears over a
drain on NHS staff, trained at public expense and now to be lured away into the
private sector, the impact on the health services in the Glasgow area, and,
ironically, in the private sector a concern over further competition.
As the debate raged on, practical problems had already arisen. Following
Rifkind's announcement it emerged that the proposed site was an asbestos dump,
prompting a public-safety row. The original Scottish Development Agency
estimate of #1m to clear the site became #5m. A further #3m was later added to
the SDA's bill by severe land engineering problems.
By the summer of 1989 the project had failed to secure the necessary private
financial backing amid rumours that the banks were reluctant to commit
themselves to the project. Months later, though, it was back on track after US
and British private investment was topped up with a Government offer of
Regional Selective Assistance totalling #22m.
Finally in March 1994 the state-of-the-art hospital, with its 21 operating
theatres, opened its doors to its first Middle Eastern patient. But trouble was
brewing. One of the hospital's leading surgeons, Dr Gerald Lawrie, returned to
America for ``personal reasons''. West Midlands Regional Health Authority
cancelled its contract. While the public debate centred over whether HCI could
and should be used to cut NHS waiting lists, behind the scenes the hospital was
already in dire financial straits.
By June, round the time of the official opening, HCI was asking its
international syndicate of banks for more cash to the tune of #15m. In
September the Royal Bank stepped in with loans to pay wages and keep the doors
open but within another two short months it was all over. HCI went into
receivership.
Salvation for the hospital's 350 staff came in February when the Abu Dhabi
Investment Company agreed to a #20m deal with the receivers, leasing the
hospital and its adjacent luxury hotel.
The American dream metamorphosed into a more modest Middle Eastern strategy of
long-term survival, concentrating on Middle Eastern and UK private markets as
well as NHS contracts.
The past 11 months have been a struggle. While the management, now headed by
the recently installed chief executive, Mike Hall, and a new development
manager, Douglas Trigg, has put occupancy rates at between 60 and 85%, the
actual number of beds occupied at any given time has fluctuated from between
about 20 and 60.
But against the backdrop of continuing bad publicity over public funding ADIC
has soldiered on to attract new patients, announcing the creation of around 100
new jobs, publicising a pioneering heart operation - on an NHS patient - and
last month finally clinching a deal with the Algerian Government under
negotiation since the summer.

TWO men have been charged in Strathclyde with a drink-drive offence even though
they were not behind the wheel. Both were supervising a learner when police
stopped their vehicle.
Chief Inspector Jim Neill, head of Strathclyde Police traffic specialist
services, said: ``Some drivers may think they can get round the law by
arranging for a sober driver holding a provisional driving licence to pick them
up from the pub and allowing the learner to drive home under their so-called
supervision.
``However, drivers should be aware that there is no hiding place as far as
drinking alcohol and being in charge of a vehicle goes.
``There are other cases where this happens though it is unusual that we have
detected them. These people should realise that they are ultimately in charge
of the vehicle.''
According to figures released yesterday by the Association of Chief Police
Officers in Scotland (ACPOS), the number of people drinking and driving in
Scotland during the festive season is decreasing.
Offenders face three months in prison or up to a #2500 fine as well as an
obligatory 10-point penalty.
A total of 746 positive tests have been recorded from 56,762 drivers stopped
since the drink-driving campaign was launched on November 24.
That represents a total of 1.3% compared to 2.1% from almost half as many
drivers during the same period last year.
Mr Ian MacKinnon, secretary of the traffic standing committee of ACPOS and
assistant chief constable in Strathclyde, said: ``I am pleased that the
drink-driving figures are showing a general decrease but the fact that nearly
750 drivers in Scotland have been caught driving over the limit must remain a
cause for concern.
``All eight Scottish police forces will remain dedicated to rooting out the
people who are prepared to put their lives, and those of others, at risk by
driving with too much alcohol.''
He said police needed help from the public to catch drunk drivers.
In Strathclyde, 301 drivers have tested positive from a total of 38,874,
representing just 0.77% of the total compared to 1.67% for the same period last
year. Thirty-five people have refused to take a breath test.
Officers called the fall in positive tests as a ``heartening'' sign that the
anti-drink-drive message was getting through.
Chief Inspector Neill said: ``It seems that our campaign of high-profile
policing and the message to motorists not to drink and drive is getting through
to the public.''

TOO late now. You should have thought about the Christmas cards weeks back and
today there isn't any point at all unless you don't mind the holly and the ivy
and the nativity and the scattering of silver tinsel over the pieces of
cardboard turning up a week after the Christmas festivities. You are simply too
late. Christmas cards were of a recent date really, made out of Victorian
scraps and a Germanic sensibility. Prince Albert and his Hanoverian entourage
invented it really. Prior to Prince Albert, Victoria's subjects were content to
spend Christmas feeding themselves to apoplexy if they were financially secure;
dying of starvation if they were not. It took a Saxe-Coburg to turn Christmas
into trees, Father Christmas, cards, and commercialism. Today Christmas cards
have two functions. One is to sting you with the notion that you haven't
bothered keeping in touch with old friends, best men, bridesmaids, aunties, and
the other you shouldn't care about. The other is to show off with bigger and
more expensive cards than people you despise and dislike. We have discovered in
the editorial department cards which come from the BBC and public relations
companies which would suggest that The Herald's writers and correspondents were
a combination of H L Menken and Mr Russell of the Times. In short we, as many
other recipients of Christmas cards are being horribly flattered.
We even have a writer of our own who eschews Christmas cards on the basis that
he doesn't like people, let alone Christmas. Yet even he sent off a few
desultory cards for this newpaper had a Christmas card of its own. It displays
a cheery Santa Claus, looking rather like the editor of this paper in fact.
Come to think of it, the editor is a trifle Germanic in appearance himself, and
horribly liberal at Christmas parties. But what the postal service is not is
liberal. You are too late for Christmas cards to arrive in time. But the
posties have spent - and never mind about the recent industrial dispute - a lot
of effort and time in getting these dods of card across to you, telling you how
many people you know and how many whose names you can't remember. We sympathise
with our colleague who never sends a card. But our sympathy goes out more to
those who have left it too late. New Year dawns.

HE intervention by George Galloway, MP, into the controversy surrounding the
Glasgow Govan Labour candidacy selection is as egregious as it was predictable.
While the democratic selection process in Govan resulted in the election by due
process of Mike Watson, MP, Mr Galloway faced the prospect of a similar process
in the new Kelvin constituency.
Despite the nomination of a challenger by party branches and affiliated
organisations, his acolytes denied Labour Party members a vote on the candidacy
and declared him elected.
The man who, in his present Hillhead constituency, was trounced in a members'
ballot, then bailed out by block votes, described this travesty as ``very
convincing''.
If anyone ``has no credibility and must not be allowed to stand'' it is the man
who simpered about the ``indefatigability'' of Saddam Hussein before the
smirking mass-murderer himself. Even Saddam Hussein's subjects got a ballot
paper, if only with one name on it. Kelvin Labour Party members didn't even get
a vote!
Mike Watson met his challenge and won by the rules. George Galloway ran away
and hid behind the same rules he now denounces. We need no lectures on
democracy from such a source, let alone crass and cynical demagoguery inflaming
spurious racial division. And Mohammed Sarwar needs this type of advocacy like
a hole in the head.

A GIRL born without hip sockets yesterday took her first steps thanks to an
American hospital and her best friend's inspiration.
Holly Ashford, 13, faced the prospect of spending her life in a wheelchair but
has now become the $500,000 girl, the cost of a series of pioneering operations
by a US hospital.
However, there was a sad aspect to the joy. Her best friend Claire John, who
had persuaded her to try the operations after six attempts to cure the trouble
in this country failed, died last year from an asthma attack.
Holly, from Yeovil, Somerset, said: ``I was determined to make it work in
tribute to her: she helped and encouraged me so much.
``It's just so sad that she's not here to see me walk. She would have been so
pleased. I kept her photograph beside my hospital bed to keep me going when
things got tough.''
In September, Holly flew to Salt Lake City to have the two 18-hour operations.
They involved surgeon Sherman Coleman carving hip sockets into her pelvis.
Now Holly is able to walk with the help of crutches and leg braces. She has
been able to return to Britain to spend Christmas at home.
She hopes to discard the final brace in four months' time and play with her
sister Harriet, seven.
``It's great, so different from this time last year and now I'm pain free,''
said Holly, who wants to be a veterinary surgeon.
``Now I have a whole new life ahead of me and I want to be able to dance and
horse ride.
``I won't ever be in a wheelchair again. It is the best Christmas present
ever.''
The hospital performed the operations free of charge but the family still need
financial help to pay for follow-up costs. An appeal fund headed by a local
woman raised #11,000 for initial bills.
Holly's mother, Pauline, said: ``It is the greatest Christmas present we could
have wished for. I can hardly take it all in that she will be able to walk.''

HEALTH spending to be slashed by a third. Investment in education to be cut by
38%. Imagine the headlines. Imagine the outpourings of the leader writers.
Imagine the rage of the political parties.
While as yet, fortunately, a distant prospect for schools or for hospitals,
there is no such consolation for council tenants. Such cuts are a cruel reality.
The full outline budget for council housing for the next three years was
announced on December 20 by the Scottish Housing Minister, Raymond Robertson.
By 1998-99 actual investment in council housing will have declined by 38% in
real terms compared to the current year's plans.
The Scottish Office will undoubtedly argue that the right to buy has led, and
will lead, to fewer council houses requiring money to be spent on them and that
this justifies cuts. But it is well-known that the right to buy has
cherry-picked the best houses; the houses which remain are those which require
disproportionate repairs and improvements.
There is also a need to replace those affordable homes which have been lost.
Investment should have been maintained for those tasks.
In past years, faced with such cuts to public-sector housing, we have at least
had the consolation of seeing housing associations pick up some of the need to
provide new and improved homes.
Not so from now on: next year Scottish Homes' budget for funding housing
associations and other independent developers will fall from #321m to #280m, a
cut of 15% in real terms?
Even this calculation depends on some rather optimistic assumptions from
Scottish Homes about how much they will raise from selling off their own homes.
We face the real prospect of any new developments from housing associations
being still born.
In anyone's terms this represents the deepest trough in the housing crisis. But
where are those headlines, those leader columns, those outcries of political
rage?
People who are homeless have every right to feel cheated. So too those on long
waiting-lists for housing and those tenants waiting patiently for repairs and
improvements to their homes.
But the failure goes deeper. It is a failure to realise the central role that
good, secure and affordable housing plays in individual lives; and so, the need
to place housing at the heart of public policy. After all, is there any point
in sending people straight from hospital to cold, damp homes; or much value in
giving a child a new book to haul around from one insecure temporary address to
the next?

JULIA Carling yesterday accepted a public apology and ``substantial'' libel
damages over allegations in the Daily Mail that she cynically cashed in on the
publicity generated by her separation from her England rugby captain husband
Will.
A High Court judge heard that the first of two articles published in October
accused Mrs Carling, presenter of Capital Woman on Carlton TV, of being
prepared to use the services of publicity agent Max Clifford in a calculated
bid to further her own career and hurt her husband.
The ``offensive and distressing'' allegation was wholly untrue, said her
solicitor Peter Crawford.
``On the contrary, she wishes it to be known that she has declined to accept
numerous offers from many national newspapers to sell her story in return for
substantial sums because she does not wish to sell information about her
separation or her private life to the press,'' he told Mr Justice Morland.
She had never met or spoken to Mr Clifford and had no intention of ever using
his services.
The second article, published the following day, compounded the damage by
accusing her of skilfully manipulating the media on the back of her separation
and of revelling in the resulting publicity.
Mrs Carling hoped that the outcome of the libel action would call a halt to the
allegations and to ``the continuing press fascination with the state of her
marriage and intrusion into her (and her husband's) private life''.
Solicitor Liz Hartley, for the newspaper, which also agreed to pay legal costs,
apologised for the distress and hurt caused by the stories, published in
reliance on false information from third parties.

THEY are the kind of things that generally go in threes.
First Ravenscraig closed, then Motherwell FC hit the bottom of the table. Now
it seems an African chief is coming to Motherwell to dig up the decapitated
head of an ancestor in an attempt to bring peace to South Africa.
Chief Nicholas Gcaleka, who also practises as a witch doctor but unfortunately
for Motherwell FC not as a centre forward, is due to fly in from South Africa
next month along with six tribal healers.
He is refusing to reveal where exactly the head is buried in Scotland but it is
thought he could be heading for the Lanarkshire town. The chief is based in
Motherwell, the one that is a Port Elizabeth suburb.
He maintains his Xhosa tribe has been cursed since King Hintsa Kaphalo was
decapitated and his head carried off as a trophy by a British soldier 167 years
ago. His tribe say the king lost his head in a battle with British forces,
colonising what is now South Africa.
Chief Gcaleka has been told that if he returns the head and buries it with the
rest of the king's body, peace will come to South Africa.
The trip is said to have the backing of South African President Nelson Mandela
while a Government lawyer is expected to join the trip to help resolve any
legal problems.
His quest has aroused interest in the South African business community: around
30 firms have helped raise #10,000 for expenses.
No exact date for the trip has been revealed but the chief has told friends the
quest must be completed by January 25. It accords with the time that manager
Alex McLeish has told his players that Motherwell FC must dig themselves out of
the relegation zone.
A spokesman for the chief said: ``This is very important to him and he's very
excited about going to Scotland. He believes that reuniting King Hintsa's head
with the rest of his body will bring peace and end corruption in South Africa.''
However, the British High Commission in Cape Town has taken issue with the
chief on the historical accuracy of his story. The commission claims King
Hintsa was never decapitated and that his head was never taken back to Scotland.
According to its records, the king was gunned down by a renegade British
soldier who opened fire during a peace conference. The soldier sliced off his
ears and was later punished at a court martial.
Meanwhile, Motherwell is bracing itself. A council spokeswoman said: ``We have
an excellent historical records department which will be only too happy to help
with any historical research.''
If the chief fails in his quest, he may find the odd head or two rolling free
if the king of Motherwell FC is not obeyed.

Washington, Thursday
RELATIVES of some of the 270 people killed in the Lockerbie bombing seven years
ago were turned away from Arlington cemetery today when they tried to leave
wreaths at the memorial there.
The cemetery has been closed because Congress and President Bill Clinton are
locked in battle over the budget.
A memorial cairn to the dead was unveiled by the president on November 3.
When the families arrived this morning, they discovered the gates locked.
Arlington, though a military cemetery, is administered by the parks service, so
it is closed, like almost all the other national parks, monuments and museums
in the US.
The relatives were furious. One said that the anniversary of the worst day of
her life, the day on which her daughter and only child was killed, was always a
horrible occasion.
To find that she could not put flowers on the monument was to add insult to
agony, and she blamed the government for playing silly Washington games.
The Pentagon then intervened and sent a military team to escort the relatives
into Arlington. They are, of course, not the only disappointed visitors. There
are scores of thousands of veterans buried there, including President Kennedy
and his brother Robert, and a steady stream of people goes there every day, as
tourists or private pilgrims.
.q.The United States today called for tougher United Nations sanctions against
Libya for refusing to hand over two Libyan suspects in the bombing.

John Macleod casts an unrelenting eye over the options left open to two
sparring erstwhile partners
NO-ONE emerges well from the sorry wreck of the Prince of Wales's marriage. He
himself has been exposed as an inadequate, insensitive husband, who neglected
his wife for the favours of another woman, who was herself married to someone
else. The princess seems addicted both to publicity and victimhood, greedy for
the privileges of her rank but loth to wear the yoke of duty, daft enough to
sleep with a cad and admit it to the world.
The Queen herself put absurd pressure on the prince many years ago to marry and
to marry well, to marry a virgin, to marry someone of appropriate standing.
There was outrageous interference in his private affairs then; over the last
three years, she has dithered and dallied, while Diana and her nasty little
alternative court pumped her position and claims for all they were worth. The
Queen's action now is drastic but eminently justifiable and comes not a moment
too soon.
Before we consider further the principals of this drama, let's outline the
constitutional issues involved and assess the impact of divorce on the future
of the Windsors and the monarchy.
First: divorce is not unlawful, and facility for it has long existed both in
the laws of Scotland and England, though until the Victorian era each divorce
required a specific Act of Parliament. Second: divorce is not unBiblical. In
the Mosaic law, it was suffered on the grounds of adultery or desertion ``for
the hardness of men's hearts''. Christ in the Gospels recognised this but
implied that the remarriage of at least one party would be adulterous. In
divorce on Biblical grounds one party is always guilty and their remarriage
will be sinful.
Many evangelical Christians regard remarriage after divorce as always and
necessarily sinful for both parties. (Many others, though, do not; when
Princess Margaret sought to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend, she found an
unlikely ally in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, who recognised that
Townsend had been an innocent party.) However, the Roman Catholic Church, which
views marriage as a sacrament, regards true marriage as indissoluble. Marriage
can be ``annulled'' - normally on the grounds of some technical inadequacy in
the marriage rite or marital relationship. Civil law here also permits
annulment, on one ground: that of a marriage which has not been physically
consummated.
The Roman Catholic view has also significantly influenced thinking in the
Church of England, of which the sovereign is supreme governor. (Oddly enough he
or she need not be a church member: James VII was a Roman Catholic.) Anglicans
do not regard divorce in and of itself as sinful and divorced parties are still
eligible to take Communion, for instance. Remarriage after divorce is frowned
on and very few Anglican vicars will grant a church wedding if one or both
parties are divorced. (When the Duke of Windsor married Wallis Simpson, in
1937, he had great difficulty in finding a clergyman prepared to officiate.)
The issue, then, is simple. The divorce will have no constitutional impact
whatever unless, at future date, the Prince of Wales decides to remarry. Much
might turn on who the happy woman might be; but he would be well-advised not to
seek a wedding service in the Church of England. He could marry in Scotland, as
the Princess Royal did some years ago, the Church of Scotland having a more
Biblical view of divorce and remarriage (Anne could claim to have been the
innocent party in her split; her former husband had fathered a child on another
woman). Or he could marry in a civil register office, as his cousin the Earl of
St Andrews did, when he took a Roman Catholic bride.
When the divorce is through, Charles will be perfectly entitled to succeed his
mother to the throne, in due time, and there is no reason in law or precedent
why he should not. (King George I was divorced but still ascended the British
throne in 1715.) Likewise, his sons remain in their proper places of
succession. He will retain his church privileges in the Anglican Communion and,
like George I, would be accepted as supreme governor. Once the divorce is
through, what his former wife chooses to do, and with whom, and how publicly,
will be irrelevant.
Diana, in strict precedent, should retain her present rank, though as ``Diana,
Princess of Wales'' rather than ``The Princess of Wales''. More likely she will
be sent off with some grandiloquent title: Duchess of Windsor, perhaps? If she
remarries she would of course shed that rank and any children of that marriage
would, I need hardly say, be without royal status or any claim to the throne.
In that regard, the Windsors might already be sweating over their malicious
refusal, in 1937, to recognise the Duchess of Windsor as Her Royal Highness and
of equal rank with her husband, formerly Edward VIII. It was argued then that
the title of Royal Highness, once granted, could not be removed; and even if
the Windsors divorced, and the duchess remarried, she would retain that rank
and further pass it on to children of her second marriage. Somewhere in
Frogmore, one hears wild American chuckles.
There are three difficulties on the horizon.
The first is the Princess of Wales herself. She has given no response to the
Queen's request that she concur in a rapid divorce. Diana might be stupid
enough - and some of her circle are certainly desperate enough - to resist.
With her consent, a divorce could be processed in a matter of weeks (and the
Queen is no doubt mindful of the impending new legislation from Lord Mackay,
with its absolute mandatory ``cooling off'' period of 12 months. If Diana
contests the divorce, it could be delayed for three years. This would be a
great embarrassment.
The second problem is the marital future of the Prince of Wales. He has
declared he does not intend to remarry. However, he declared a good deal on
July 29, 1981, that he has since broken, and the word of an adulterer may
readily change with circumstances. Besides, he could find it hard to reign
without someone to act as consort: true, there might be a daughter-in-law but,
on what they have seen of heterosexuality, his sons may decide they prefer boys.
If the prince does make a second bid for marital bliss, and if his bride is
deemed fit by the public, and if he does not seek an Anglican wedding, this
could be accomplished readily enough. But what if he decides to marry Camilla
Parker Bowles? She is widely viewed as Diana's heartbreak, as the scarlet
woman, as the ageing adventuress who saw off the young and innocent bride. On
that ground alone there would be riots in the streets.
Further, Mrs Parker Bowles is herself now divorced, and she is of Roman
Catholic background (though her present relationship to that system is
unclear). Marriage to a Roman Catholic, by any in line to the throne, is
forbidden under the 1701 Act of Settlement.
The prince's marriage would also require, in his position, the permission of
the Queen. She would be bound to take Cabinet advice and that advice would
certainly be, at the present time, that he could not marry this woman and
remain heir apparent to the throne.
Charles will almost certainly weather the demands widely made, at present, that
he step aside from the succession and leave the way clear for his elder son. As
long as he wants to be king that will remain the position. But if he tries to
marry Mrs Parker Bowles he will be denied the choice.
The third difficulty is more delicate: is Charles the father of his sons?
Nothing shows the stupidity of the princess more than her free admission of
adultery. (It was, in strict law, an admission to high treason by herself and
for the wretched fellow involved.) Apart from the anguish caused to her
children, it raises the obvious question of their paternity. Prince William is
obviously the son of his father and of the true Teutonic line. In Prince
Harry's case, a resemblance is less evident.
Only a few weeks ago, we were exhorted to marvel at the courage, dignity, and
bearing of the princess in her sensational Panorama interview. In hindsight, it
already appears mawkish, embarrassing, and rehearsed. It has also proved a
major political blunder. By admitting her own adultery and by declaring openly
that she did not believe her husband would be king, she committed the
unforgivable in the eyes of the Queen.
The princess showed both malice and wilful ignorance of her position. She
pushed beyond bounds the great tolerance granted her these three years past. It
was also an astonishing blunder to predict she herself would not be queen -
that future contingency, however tenuous it appeared, being the strongest
weapon in her armoury.
When the divorce comes - and come it will, whatever she might now try - the
princess will be visibly devalued in rank and standing. Her looks are already
fading. Her sons are growing up and away from her influence. People, I think,
are beginning to laugh at her, as they whooped at Rory Bremner's wonderful
panda-eyed parody of her broadcast.
There has been, for 40 years, an insistent tradition of prophecy in the
Hebrides that Charles will never reign. That remains to be seen. But his wife's
role in the drama is over. She has written herself out of the script and, at
the last - for all her miseries - has only herself to blame.

Sarajevo, Thursday
NATO moved quickly today to stamp a peace strategy on the ruins of Bosnia and
told leaders of the former warring factions that its 60,000 troops would go
where they pleased.
Units of the biggest peace-time force the alliance has ever mustered fanned out
across the country, tearing down roadblocks and passing frontlines which its
United Nations predecessor never crossed.
``I am an optimist.......I am just tickled pink with what I seee already,'' the
overall Commander of the Nato's Implementation Force (IFOR), Admiral Leighton
Smith told CNN television 24 hours after it took over from the UN.
Smith met military leaders of the Muslim, Croat and Bosnian Serb communities to
tell them how he planned to enforce the peace which their political leaders
signed in Paris last week.
He said he had told them at ``very succesful'' talks that his multi-national
force from more than 30 nations would exercise complete freedom of movement and
go ``wherever we need to go''.
Smith laid down his plans at a heavily-guarded meeting with the one-time
warring faction chiefs at the first meeting of a Joint Military Commission set
up to monitor implementation of the Paris peace accord.
Britain's Defence Minister Michael Portillo said the 13,000-strong British
contingent would use force if necessary against anyone who tried to break the
pact ending the worst conflict in Europe since the Second World War.
He said that the Nato force, better armed than UN troops and backed by a strong
international resolve, would try persuasion and argument first but back it up
with firepower.
``.......it is perfectly clear that they (British troops) are armed in such a
way to defend themselves and they have the authority to use force if that is
necessary to implement the peace agreement,'' he said on a brief visit to
Sarajevo.
``You'll find that the forces are much more prepared to defend
themselves.......but also take action against anyone who may try to break the
peace agreement,'' he said.
Meanwhile, the commander of US ground troops in Bosnia said in Tuzla today he
planned to put forward bases in Serb-held territory, where foreign troops were
barred during 43 months of war, to enforce the peace accord.
Major General William Nash told reporters all 20,000 US troops in the
60,000-member Nato peacekeeping force should be deployed in Bosnia by the end
of January.
He said US Army engineers are expected to complete a temporary bridge next week
across the Sava River, marking the border between Croatia and Bosnia north of
this northeast Bosnia US base. This would allow the First Armoured Division now
massing in Hungary to roll south into Bosnia.
Nash said he had been meeting with military leaders of all the parties to the
peace accord and ``their words and deeds are positive''.
The Bosnian Serbs have been the most critical of the peace agreement and are
regarded by US officials as harbouring factions that are most likely to break
the peace.
``They have pledged their support,'' Nash said, adding that the Serbs had
started to clear minefields and withdraw to boundaries laid down in the
US-brokered peace deal signed in Paris on December 14.
Nash said the first units of the Armoured division, driving Abrams tanks and
armoured Bradley Fighting Vehicles, would be met near the Sava crossing and
would then head south to Tuzla.
Later units would move directly to forward bases set up to run patrols along
the dividing lines between Bosnian factions.
A US military official said a Russian airborne brigade would be stationed in
Serb-held territory around Bijeljina, northeast of Tuzla. It will be the first
US-Russian military operation with combat potential since the Second World
War.-Reuter.

A SKIER who survived three nights of blizzards while lost in Glenshee is to

out of the mountains during a lull in the weather after spending two nights
entombed in a snow-hole in February.
The 45-year-old from East Kilbride, a cashier with a plumbers' merchants in
Glasgow, will tell of his ordeal on the LWT documentary Missing, to be screened
at 9pm on Scottish.
Second tragedy
A WOMAN whose husband was killed in the Piper Alpha disaster has been hit by
another tragedy. Mrs Christine Richard's son, Brian, 22, was found dead in a
flat at Linlithgow, West Lothian. Police have ruled out suspicious
circumstances. Mrs Richard, of Polmont, Stirlingshire, was widowed when her
husband, Bob, died in the 1988 North Sea oil rig disaster.
Pleasant shock
TWO thousand electricians in Scotland's building industry are to get a 3.5% pay
rise from January, their union, the AEEU said yesterday.
Park stabbing
POLICE in Edinburgh are treating as attempted murder the stabbing of a
15-year-old boy in Corstorphine Park. The boy, from the Corstorphine area,
suffered a punctured lung and last night was said to be ``serious but stable''
in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
Tory choice
THE Scottish Conservative Party have chosen their candidate to oppose Labour
front-bench spokesman John McFall in his Dumbarton constituency at the next
General Election. He is Mr Peter Ramsay, 40, of Helensburgh, a personal banking
manager with the Clydesdale Bank in West Dunbartonshire.
Hospice grant
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday gave a #500,000 Christmas present
to support the new children's hospice, Rachel House, currently being built at
Kinross. The move follows a meeting between Mr Forsyth and representatives of
the Children's Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS). The Government has already
contributed #750,000 to the project
Bogus sales
POLICE last night issued a warning to elderly people in the Kirkintilloch area
to be on their guard after a bogus door-to-door sales team robbed a pensioner
of a three-figure sum of money on Wednesday. The incident follows a spate of
similar calls by a number of women to pensioners' homes over the last month.

I HAVE just read the item in Tom Shields's Diary about Councillor Buchanan and
the use of the expression ``nig-nog'' (December 19). This was an expression
constantly used in the Army during the days of National Service. It never had
any racial connotation.
I recall one morning in July, 1949, when my training platoon was being marched
down to the dining-hall at Fort George when the drill corporal stopped the
platoon suddenly; he put his face close to mine and stated loudly: ``Doig, you
are a f****** nig-nog! What are you?''
I was then required to roar as loudly as possible in the affirmative. One
rendition was never enough, nor was the volume ever satisfactory.
We would then continue our progress towards the dining-hall by which time
another platoon had passed us which brought the platoon's invective upon me as
this would mean that there was now a much longer queue at the cookhouse waiting
for the ATS girls' watery porridge.
The culprit was not necessarily told what his offence had been. It was all part
of the game and afforded the corporal or sergeant some wry amusement. I do not
recall that I was offended thereby. He was probably right!
Thousands of graduates of the Highland Brigade Training Battalion at Fort
George will remember such occasions.

``GOT a story?'' is the start of a little white-on-black box which usually sits
on page two of the Sun newspaper. It then tells you to phone the Sun's news
desk. On Wednesday afternoon, according to the paper's editor, someone did that
with devastating effect, and gave the paper what it quite rightly calls the
``royal scoop of the year.''
However, such scoops are transitory. What the Sun had to itself at 10pm that
night was by midnight a far more in-depth three-page study of the Queen's
intervention in her eldest son's marriage in The Herald.
The point though, is that once again one of Britain's tabloids, often so
sleazy, crass, and embarrassing, was spot on in its coverage of a royal story.
While the tabloids embellish so many stories, their track record on the Prince
and Princess of Wales in recent years has been praiseworthy. Perhaps, of
course, it is because to readers interested in the royals, the truth is so
compelling that embellishment is not required.
As the Wales's marriage deteriorated, both sides used the tabloids to wage
megaphone diplomacy of the loudest kind on each other to try to win public
sympathy. All it really won was newspaper sales.
In 1987, the harder edge of royal reporting began as the rift between Charles
and Diana became obvious. The media was desperate for details. Eventually the
details came, often from friends of the couple. That was for two reasons.
Either to give their side of the story a bigger airing, or purely for money.
Even Sloane rangers require the occasional injection of hard cash into their
bank accounts.
Then in 1992 came the biggest eye-opener so far - Andrew Morton's book Diana:
Her True Story, which revealed that the princess felt ``trapped in a loveless
marriage'', suggested she suffered from bulimia nervosa, and that she made a
number of suicide attempts in the early 1980s.
It was followed by the ``Squidgygate'' tapes, giving details of an telephone
conversation between Diana and James Gilbey. Then ``Camillagate'', another
tape, this time a highly personal conversation between Charles and Camilla
Parker Bowles.
The palace was appalled and covert attempts were made by the Queen's senior
aides to involve the Press Complaints Commission in somehow curbing the
tabloids. Lord McGregor, the chairman of the PCC, was told that newspaper
claims that the Princess of Wales and her friends had co-operated on the Morton
book were lies.
Lord McGregor attempted to censure the press. Unfortunately, he was soon to
discover that he had been misled by the palace.
Thoughts of official complaints to the PCC dissipated. Instead, the palace
withdrew to the sidelines as the confirmation finally came in television
interviews by Prince Charles and Princess Diana that both had indeed committed
adultery. The tabloids had been right all along.
Mr Stuart Higgins, editor of The Sun, believes the Queen's intervention in the
marriage saga is a courageous one.
``I think the Queen took it upon herself, very bravely, to intervene and decide
out of commonsense this can't go on any longer, to have the whole thing played
out day after day, the public bickering, the tit for tat. The interviews after
each other, hitting at each other, he said.
Very magnanimous from a journalist whose paper has depended so much on the
public warring for selling papers.

<HEADLINE>Plea for realism on fishing deal</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974766228</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FISHERIES Minister Tony Baldry appealed for realism from Britain's fishermen
last night as he prepared to accept a Euro deal on catches which will mean
belt-tightening for trawlermen.
Whatever the scale of concessions he wrings out of marathon negotiations in
Brussels, national catch quotas in British waters will be cut drastically in
the name of conservation.
Reductions of up to a half in permitted catches of main species have been
tabled by the Brussels Commission, relying on scientific evidence that EU
fishing waters are desperately depleted and need a respite.
The negotiations were adjourned last night and a final deal is not expected
until later today.
Mr Baldry insisted he was out for the ``best possible deal'' for fishermen and
added: ``We have to strike a balance between conservation and ensuring the
industry can bring in a decent catch to sustain them.''
Of the industry's reaction, he said: ``At the end of the day, my ability will
have to be judged by them. It is their livelihoods, it is their futures which
are at stake and I think and hope that they will make a realistic judgment on
what we will be able to achieve here.''
The Commons defeat for a Government motion supporting cuts made little
difference to Mr Baldry's bargaining position but he hopes to limit the
reduction in the planned British North Sea plaice quota to 30% instead of the
suggested 47%. He is also arguing for smaller cuts than recommended in hake and
mackerel quotas.
The outcome will determine the future prosperity of the UK fleet, with
fishermen warning that some trawler owners will go out of business.

THE Herald journalist Chris Holme has won the first Reuter Foundation
Fellowship in Medical Journalism at Oxford University.
Mr Holme, 41, a news reporter at The Herald's Edinburgh office since 1987, will
spend three months next year at Green College, Oxford, studying aspects of the
campaign against the worldwide resurgence of tuberculosis.
The Reuter Foundation is the news agency's charitable and educational arm. It
was set up in 1982 to promote high standards in international journalism.
Its new fellowship in medical journalism is intended to offer specialist
writers and broadcasters an opportunity to carry out personal research. A
second fellowship is now being offered at the Columbia Graduate School of
Journalism in New York.
Mr Holme has written extensively in The Herald on medical issues, including the
development 40 years ago of the first 100% cure for TB by an Edinburgh team led
by Sir John Crofton.

Rikki Fulton's calling has proved an uplifting experience for all, so it should
come as no surprise that he is a religious man. But he is also one of the most
popular in Scotland, or so it seems to Allan Laing
FUNNY things, jokes. But they're really only funny things when you hear them
the first time. After that, they tend to lose a bit in the telling. It is the
law of diminishing returns, I suppose.
``The trouble is they're not like songs,'' explains a thoughtful Rikki Fulton,
a man who over the years has delivered more gags than you could shake a stick
at. ``Kenneth McKellar can stand up on stage and say `Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
now like to sing a beautiful number - and one of my own personal favourites . .
. Aye Fond Kiss.' And the audience will burst into wild applause. As a
comedian, I always used to think how lucky singers were because you could never
do that with a joke.''
Well, actually, that is not strictly true. If you're Rikki Fulton and Jack
Milroy masquerading as Francie and Josie, then it can happen. During a recent
performance at the King's Theatre in Glasgow, the pair were in full comic
flight when Francie said ``Tell them the one about Arbroath, Josie.'' And, as
if they had announced an old familiar song, the audience clapped and cheered
like there was no tomorrow, a roar of approval in anticipation of the pair's
best-loved routine.
The origins of the joke (anyone who has ever seen Francie and Josie will be
familiar with this particular Arbroath declaration) are worth examining in some
detail for they illustrate perfectly the symbiotic relationship which exists
between the two old rogues of Scottish variety. Stripped bare, it is a
wonderfully silly wee gag about a chap who chaps on a door and it's answered by
another chap and the chap who chapped the door asks ``Is your grannie in?'' And
the chap who answered the door to the chap who chapped the door says ``No,
she's at Arbroath.'' Then the chap who chapped the door says ``Well, I'll just
wait till she's finished.''
But the real beauty of the gag (think ``soup'', then read it out loud and
you'll get it) is the fact that it is only the skeleton key, its funny bones
inspirationally fleshed out by Fulton and Milroy's brilliant ad-libbing. Off
they go into a truly hilarious routine - different every time they do it -
which can last as long as 10 or even 15 minutes.
Rikki Fulton recalls that the gag came into being many years ago during a Five
Past Eight Show at the King's. ``We were doing this sketch where we were locked
out of a bed and breakfast; it was supposed to be a haunted house in the middle
of nowhere. And Frankenstein monsters and mummies would appear as we were
standing on the steps of this house.
``So there was this mummy standing over us and Jack, typically, said `Tell them
the one about Arbroath, Josie.' And I took it from there.''
You had to feel sorry for the poor mummy. There he was, standing there like a
ham sandwich at a Jewish wedding, while Fulton and Milroy launched into this
totally unscripted routine. He didn't know whether to stay, join in, or walk
off for a cup of tea and a fag.
``I do have this terrible habit of ad-libbing,'' explains Fulton, with an eye
for the understatement. ``I've done Moliere and Shakespeare and I've found that
certain members of my profession - classical actors - don't like it. But it is
what I do. Jack is exactly the same. I noticed when we first started to work
together that, on first nights it sometimes didn't work too well. But on the
second night we got roars of laughter because we'd say to ourselves `I'll stick
this or that in.' We just said whatever came into our minds.
``We were both from the same school - and it wasn't a terribly disciplined one,
I suppose. We still ad-lib all the time. It's a kind of challenge to each
other; a sort of `get out of that one' kind of thing. And a lot of the best
material we ever had came from that.''
Every time they did it, Rikki would go home and write all the ad-libs down.
``I'd write it properly, hone it and tidy it up, and then other ideas would
occur to me. And it all came from this ad-lib.''
We are sitting in the study of the actor's palatial West End home. He is in
relaxed mode, comfortably stretched out in a leather easy chair. Any time is a
good time to talk to the amiable Mr Fulton - but the festive season is more
appropriate than most.
After all, over many years we have come to associate him with Hogmanay. First,
through his Scotch and Wry series and, more recently, through our annual visit
to the manse of Scotland's cheeriest minister, that familiar bundle of Church
of Scotland laughs, the Rev I M Jolly.
But right now, barely a fortnight before his new show is due to be broadcast,
Fulton is musing about his life, about his career, and about the gift God gave
him - the abiding talent to crack a light and make us laugh. A profoundly
thoughtful and considerate man, he is an engaging conversationalist with an
endearing habit of wandering wonderfully off the point.
You very quickly realise that there are an awful lot of good things to be said
for Rikki Fulton. The first, and probably the most important, is the fact that
you couldn't meet a nicer man in a month's walking. The second is that, by
virtue of the fact that he is probably the finest comic actor of his (or any
other) generation, he makes us laugh. And the third is that, throughout a long
and distinguished career, he has steadfastly refused to desert his beloved
Glasgow.
Now comes the ``but''. But the thing about Fulton is that there are no buts
about him. It may be a cliche but he really is one of our ``best-loved'' actors.
He is show business's glorious exception. With him, what you see is what you
get. A proper gentleman. A happy and thoroughly contented human being with his
heart in the right place and his feet firmly on the ground. One of nature's
good guys. Was it ever thus? Probably. For, no matter who you talk to, you will
never hear a word said against him.
You mention his childhood - by all accounts a happy one in Dennistoun, brought
up the son of a newsagent and stationer - and you set off a fascinating train
of nostalgic thought. You quickly realise that here is a man, refreshingly
untainted by the vulgar excesses of the modern world, who treasures those
old-fashioned, benignly conservative values which disappeared, like snow off a
dyke, around the time the Corporation tram cars ceased to ply their trade in
Glasgow.
``I was born in 1924 so we are talking about a totally different set of rules,
regulations, customs, and views. It was a different country altogether. I mean
sex was a word you didn't use. Homosexuality was something you never heard
about. Anyone living together out of marriage would not be visited by either
family. If someone committed some terrible murder then they would be hanged.
``It was a happier and safer world to live in because it had all to do with the
fact that you knew exactly where you were. Policemen were respected, ministers
were respected. You wouldn't dream of arguing with your mother or father. They
were obeyed. Drugs were not around; the worst thing you could do was smoke too
early,'' he recalls.
This almost quaint sense of morality, which is both rare and unfashionable in
this day and age, is reflected in his work. As a regular churchgoer, dirty
jokes are anathema to him. Which is why there's nothing remotely crude or
smutty about Francie and Josie. It's all good clean fun. Likewise the Rev
Jolly. What Fulton delivers is a strength of characters, great comic roles
which don't need the crutch of bad taste to hold them up.
Rikki Fulton took his first tentative step into the world of showbiz shortly
after he was demobbed from the Navy. It was the mid forties and he was working
in a mundane job in a Glasgow shipping office. For some reason he found himself
drawn to the theatre, joining the local amateur Pantheon Club. After an
audition with the BBC he made his first radio broadcast in 1947. The engagement
led to more regular work, hosting the BBC Show Band Show from London (to this
day his only lengthy absence from Scotland).
It was not until 1954 that he first appeared on the stage as a comedian - in an
Edinburgh Festival revue. Shortly after that Howard and Wynham, famous
impressarios of the day, signed Fulton up on a long-term contract and teamed
him with legendary Scots comic Alec Finlay.
More than 40 years later, Rikki Fulton can look back with no small measure of
pride and satisfaction on a rich and diverse stage career. There was his
inspired performance in the celebrated Scots version of the Moliere plays for
Bill bryden at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum. Then there was his big-screen role as
the sinister, steely-eyed, KGB villain in Michael Apted's Gorky Park. More
recently, of course, he's been back on familiar territory with BBC Scotland's
re-working of The Vital Spark.
But Rikki Fulton's kindest words are reserved for his theatrical partnership
with Jack Milroy. Of all the things he has done, it's Francie and Josie which
he has enjoyed the most.
He explains it this way: ``You know how people go to the theatre, watch a show,
and on the way home in the car they'll chuckle away and say `That was helluva
funny when they did this or that.' Well, that's exactly what Jack and I do too
after a show. We talk about it all the way home!
``There is something very rewarding and particularly satisfying about working
with someone where you get this great togetherness and understanding with each
finding the other funny.
``There are other things I have done which have put me under tremendous
pressure or have perhaps been greater challenges. I am very proud of them but,
in the end, it's Francie and Josie which gives me the most fun.''
Mind you, there was a time not so long ago when it appeared that the characters
were fast approaching the end of the road. But, at 67 and 71 respectively,
Milroy and Fulton seem prepared to soldier on for a while yet. Indeed, Fulton
is currently slaving over a hot computer screen, writing an entire new show for
the gruesome twosome which will be unleashed upon an unsuspecting Glasgow
public some time next year.
``It is a lot of work and I often complain that I'm stuck in front of a word
processor and all I get from Jack is the odd postcard from Tenerife or Majorca
saying `Keep going, China,''' he quips. ``To be honest it's not the happiest
way of spending the day or night. And there's something about writing. At the
back of your mind there's always this great block of anxiety about a joke which
you might find helluva funny but that no-one else will.''
The truth is that Rikki Fulton, at 71, will not allow himself to be put under
pressure from work. A serious heart attack a few years back served to
concentrate his mind and slow him down. Nevertheless, the offers of work are
still there if he wants them.
``I have to tell you, the things I have turned down only this year in film and
television parts you would not believe. And I turned them down because it would
have meant me being away from home for too long. If I cannot have my wife
(Kate, to whom he is utterly devoted) along with me then I don't want to know.
In any case, I am much more at home in the theatre in Scotland,'' he explains.

The Queen Mother encouraged a meek and biddable Diana to pass through the
portals of protocol, says Anne Simpson
NOT many chuckles at the Buck House Happy Hour tonight. Those letters from the
Queen, so obviously intended to draw the messy tale of Splitsville to a close,
are having precisely the opposite effect. In terms of drama, The Public Fall of
the House of Windsor might yet outrun The Mousetrap. One thing is certain: next
Monday, the Sovereign's seasonal broadcast to an increasingly truculent nation
will notch up its biggest audience for years. The question is: will she, or
won't she?
The notion of an idealised royal family began in the same era that Christmas
itself became an elaborate family festival. Now Elizabeth II, the only one of
the tribe still actively holding regality and worthiness together, must enter
our living rooms as the beleaguered figurehead of ramshackle mythologies.
Apart from, maybe, one reference, couched in Latin, to another horrible year,
it is doubtful that Her Majesty will unburden her heart to the country. She was
born to adhere to a system that imposes emotional denial upon its members. Her
siblings might openly challenge it but look what happens - her siblings become
humiliatingly unstuck.
In fact, this is the very British story of four women and a wimp. It began with
a hyper-sensitive child who sought more ready affection than a royal mother
seemed able to give. So he sought and found pampering approval from a figure
one generation removed; that make-believe granny of the people, the Good Queen
Mum.
On reflection, the early travails of Charles's love life were the first
elements to threaten his public reputation. He was hopeless, and hopelessly, in
love with numerous society women, all too independent and intelligent to settle
for the stifling grandeur of marriage to the throne's heir and its long
practiced moral deceits. As a result, Charles the Misunderstood sought release
from misery in the company of a high-caste country woman whose gumboots-style
and impressive plainness are, interestingly, not unlike those of her lover's
mother, the Queen.
According to Lord Charteris, permanent Lord-in-Waiting at Buckingham Palace,
Camilla Parker Bowles is the love of Charles's life. Yet his very dependence on
the affection and guidance of a married woman (as she was then), did not
prevent him submitting to the marriage instructed by his family. So, by taking
Diana as his wife, Charles the Misunderstood became increasingly Charles the
Wretched.
Here, the cruellest irony pierces the tale, for it was with the Queen Mother's
encouragement that the meek and biddable Lady Diana Spencer passed through the
portals of insufferable protocol as consort to the prince. Diana is the
grandchild of one of the dowager Queen's closest friends, the late Ruth, Lady
Fermoy, and popular belief has it that the two old ladies set about their
disastrous match-making when it became obvious that Charles could no longer
delay choosing a wife.
From the start, some say, Lady Fermoy had worries about a misalliance. However,
in Diana, the Crown had found not just the required sexual innocent but a
symbol of modernity. What it eventually got, to maybe its greatest cost, was a
virgin who refused to be sacrificial. The Wales's doomed marriage is perhaps
the Queen Mother's only public mistake.
She was 82 at the time of the wedding and no doubt possessed an elderly
incomprehension about the very fundamental shifts in British life. Infidelity
would not have shocked her, since that has always been a sophisticated,
upper-crust deceit, but the candid independence of contemporary women was
something completely alien to her generation.
All those years before, it had been the Queen Mother's insistence on duty that
had been paramount in Princess Margaret's decision not to marry the handsome
and gallant divorcee, Peter Townsend. As things worsened in her favourite
grandchild's marriage, she might have thought her influence would be equally
effective in taming Diana. It wasn't, with the result that an old Queen and a
``future Queen'' allegedly came to detest each other.
Howvever, having been told to marry by his mother, and now finally instructed
by her to divorce, Charles seeks to shake off the ditherer image by announcing
he will never marry again, and possibly this is one way to pre-empt any further
scorn or outrage in his direction.
The desanctifying of Diana began with James Hewitt's caddish revelations and
continued with Julia Carling's silky catfight over her foolish husband's roving
eye. Yet in both instances Diana has emerged triumphant. Hewitt has been
black-balled from society and Will Carling has not only lost his wife, he has
been snubbed and dumped by a princess for being too crass in his infatuation.
And still Diana's popularity rating far outstrips her husband's.
Of course, Prince Charles has no need to marry Camilla for, as things are, her
own divorce, earlier this year, tidies and elevates her status as his closest
confidante. The couple could simply reinforce the contemporary trend and
co-habit, with the hearty and efficient Princess Anne acting as consort when
required. Yet Charles's ruling out of Camilla as a wife raises still more
questions than it answers. If she is to be seen accompanying him in official
life, will the citizenry wear it? Camilla has no public following and the
palace must consider how her appearance would go down in places such as
Bermondsey or Crathie.
Certainly Diana will never be queen, and she has long known that. Skittish in
Klosters, some years ago, she alerted photographers to an outsize medal on her
ski jacket, explaining: ``I have awarded it to myself for services to my
country because nobody else will.''
Graceful, hardworking, wilful, this noblewoman demonstrates repeatedly how an
instinctively manipulative and beautiful creature can hold her own against any
men.
In the past, women who owed their royal station to their marriages were shunted
out to the country when they fell from favour, or they had their heads chopped
off. But the broad, muscular back and full-blown figure which the princess now
reveals in those low-cut, shapely gowns seems to symbolise her metamorphosis
from Shy Di to powerful and self-possessed womanhood. She has also added a
feminist agenda to her armoury, reflecting the demands of twentieth-century
women to be defined not by men but as themselves.
Curiosity about her fate will remain fervent. Her loving attentiveness as a
mother is not doubted but what might stymie her chances of some sort of
ambassadorial existence, or establishing an alternative but influential
commoners' court, will be any indication of vindictive behaviour over the
divorce. Or any more predatory meddling with other people's marriages.
Diana says she wishes to use the media interest in her to her country's
advantage, and not be ``battered by it'', but fame and celebrity are fickle
allies in establishing a long-term career. As she ages and the glamour becomes
less immediately photogenic, she will find the cameras moving on to other
targets. In seven years' time, Prince William will be 20 and his hunt for a
royal bride will be the magnet for all the gossip hacks.
So, what advice would this clever but damaged mother-in-law give to a woman who
will be judged just as much as she was by the man she marries, rather than as
the person she is? Would she tell William's bride to seek affection from an
adoring public rather than from her husband? To reconcile herself to public
duty and private loneliness? To walk out before her face is on the souvenir
T-shirts? Or to find consolation in being the world's Number One cover girl?
Would she tell the royal bride to take a lover, or take fate on the chin? Or
even suggest that, given her own eventual divorce settlement, the marriage of a
twenty-first century woman to a future king could be a worthwhile life choice,
of sorts?
Nothing more illustrates the gulf in regal and emotional understanding between
Diana and the Queen than a comment in another royal TV expose earlier this
week. The divorce letters had not yet been made public but, in the programme,
certain persons were heard to discuss the imminent departure of a beautiful
lady from the royal family. Only they were talking about Britannia.

EXCLUSIVE
MOHAMMED Sarwar, one of the candidates at the centre of the Labour racism row
in Govan, has been pitched into a new controversy - this time over his business
affairs.
The Herald can reveal that the millionaire Pakistani businessman, who is the
Labour councillor for Pollokshields, is to be reported to the next district
council planning meeting over a breach of planning regulations.
Acting on information also passed to The Herald, planning and building control
officers visited Mr Sarwar's United Cash &amp; Carry business in West Street, on
the south side of the city.
The planning officer found that Mr Sarwar's business had expanded into an
adjoining building and was selling goods to the public.
The retailing is in direct contradiction to the full planning permission
granted for the building to a Mr Muhammed Akram by the district council in June
this year.
This permission had been granted on condition that ``the premises shall be used
for a storage and distribution warehouse as described by the applicant in his
letter dated March 20, and for no other purpose''.
Last night, a district council spokesman said: ``There are all sorts of things
on display to the general public in Mr Akram's depot and the effect of this is
that the planning department is to go to the next council planning committee
meeting to seek authority to serve on Mr Akram and Mr Sarwar breach of
condition notices which would require them to stop immediately.
``There is no right of appeal against this. The first available planning
committee meeting is on January 5 and the department will seek authority to
serve the notice then. If they did not stop, we could go to the fiscal.''
United is also apparently trading as a retail warehouse with members of the
public able to walk in off the street and buy goods. However, the district
council spokesman said that no-one in the area had been given retail consent.
``United has only wholesale consent,'' the spokesman said.
He added: ``If it is brought to our attention that there is an operation which
is carried out which is in breach of planning conditions, we have to
investigate and take steps to regularise it.''
The Herald understands that no-one has so far complained about this.
The district council spokesman also said there appeared to be no building
warrant for the two connecting entrances between Mr Sarwar's business and Mr
Akram's warehouse.
He said that fire exits could also be an issue. What had been set up to
safeguard a small number of warehousemen would not not necessarily be
satisfactory for the public.
Last night, Mr Sarwar's brother, Mohammad Ramzam, who deals with commercial
operations, said they were letting the building from Mr Akram, who was their
landlord. ``He assured us there was no problem as a cash and carry. A deal has
not been finalised. We are hoping to get a deal by the end of the month.
``I am not sure what it says on the lease. I don't know the complications. My
solicitor is looking into it. We can easily stop people going into Mr Akram's
depot or we can apply for change of use.''
Mr Ramzam said he believed his manager had knocked two entrances through to Mr
Akram's depot as a temporary measure. ``I'm not sure about building warrants.''
Mr Ramzam also said they were operating as a wholesaler and not a retailer.
``Our stock is sold at wholesale prices. Some people can say they are the
public but we say they are small business people.''
On the question of fire safety, he said: ``I think we have enough fire exits in
the building. It is well covered.''
It is the second time Mr Sarwar, who is a member of the Scottish Labour Party's
NEC and who has been elected to Pollokshields East on the new unitary
authority, has found himself the centre of controversy.
Last week, Mr Sarwar, who is bidding to become the first Asian MP in the UK,
was embroiled in a furious row after he lost his bid to become Labour
prospective parliamentary candidate for Glasgow Govan by one vote to Mike
Watson MP.
It emerged then that about 52 ballot papers - many of them Sarwar supporters -
had been disallowed, leading to the claim that they had been victims of racism.
Loud cries were raised for an inquiry while Mr Sarwar contemplated a legal
action. That threat was withdrawn pending a meeting of Labour's national
executive committee which will decide whether to investigate Mr Sarwar's
complaint when it meets on January 24.

TWO Scots Guards who shot dead an unarmed teenager on the streets of Belfast
were sent back to jail yesterday after a court rejected their appeals against
conviction for murder.
James Fisher, 27, from Ayr, and Mark Wright, 22, of Arbroath, who were given
life sentences, heard the judgment at the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.
The youth's father, Mr Peter McBride, 46, said he was satisfied but hoped there
would not be another Lee Clegg-style campaign to free the two men.
``There is no point in judges passing sentences if there is somebody else
coming behind with his magic pen and then rubbing them out,'' he said, adding
that ``life should mean life''.
His 18-year-old son, also Peter, was shot dead in the republican New Lodge Road
area of north Belfast in September, l992.
Fisher and Wright denied murder, claiming they opened fire because they
believed the boy, who was running away at the time, was carrying a ``coffee
jar'' bomb and they feared for their lives. He was unarmed.
Defence lawyers claimed crucial witnesses lied at the original trial because
they were hostile to the presence of the British Army.
The Northern Ireland Lord Chief Justice, Sir Brian Hutton, dismissing the
appeals, said there had been no justifiable reason for the shooting.
However, at the end of his judgment, he declared: ``This court shares the hope
of the trial judge that Parliament will give consideration to the substitution
of a single crime of culpable homicide for the present distinct crimes of
murder and manslaughter, so that in a case of this nature a trial judge will
have power to impose a sentence for the term of years he considers just . . .
rather than be compelled to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.''
Fisher, of Glendale Place, Belmont, Ayr, and Wright, of Glebe Road, Arbroath,
were taken back to Maghaberry Prison, near Lisburn, County Antrim, to resume
their sentences.
Fisher's wife Julie left the court without making any comment but the soldiers'
former commanding officer, who did not wish to be named, said: ``These soldiers
found themselves operating in a difficult and dangerous environment. They had
to make a judgment quickly and decisively and that is what they did. I consider
they acted in good faith.''

DID people really buy souvenirs of the newly spliced couple back in 1981?
Apparently, yes. So what would the Charles and Di mugs, plates, wedding photos,
and suchlike be worth today in the wake of the Queen's divorce ultimatum?
Inquiries themselves turned into something of a mug's game. At Sotheby's of
London, a spokeswoman said severely: ``We wouldn't actually sell them, they'd
be too contemporary.''
The message was similar from the Glasgow branch of Phillips. ``We don't deal
with that kind of thing at all. They are not antiques but collectors' items.''
There was an equally negative reaction from Christie's of London. ``We don't
actually deal with royal memorabilia,'' said a spokeswoman.
Mr Sam Chalmers of the Scottish Auction House, Glasgow, confirmed that they
would classify photographs of the royal wedding and commemorative china as
collectors' items, would sell them, but that their auction price was
unpredictable. Would the couple's split make such items more or less valuable?
``Everyone's talking about it,'' Mr Chalmers replied, ``and probably will be
for years to come. But you just don't know the effect of these things.''
The owner of the Kilmarnock firm of Oliver's Antique and Bricabrac Store was
equally forthright: ``We do get stuff like this from house sales, it does sell,
but for a very small price.'' She also pointed out that there was a ``lot of it
made''.
She didn't think that the latest turn of events in the marriage saga would make
any difference: ``I don't see any market for this monetary-wise for quite a
long time.''
So there's little point in rushing to the loft and dusting down images of the
smiling couple. You might as well let the cobwebs gather.

NEWSPAPERS which printed articles before the trial of Mr Geoffrey Knights -
boyfriend of EastEnders actress Gillian Taylforth - face contempt proceedings
after a High Court decision yesterday.
Two judges gave the Attorney-General permission to take action against the
Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, the now-defunct Today, the Sun, and the Daily Star
for publishing the articles before Mr Knights was tried on a charge of wounding
with intent Miss Taylforth's driver Martin Davies.
Mr Knights' trial was halted at Harrow Crown Court in October on the grounds
that the ``unfair, outrageous, and oppressive'' publicity meant he would not
get a fair trial.
Mr Justice Popplewell, sitting with Mr Justice Dyson, said after a brief
hearing yesterday - at which the newspapers were not represented - that
Attorney-General Sir Nicholas Lyell could seek fines against the newspapers'
editors and publishers.
Mr Knights, a 41-year-old businessman, was arrested in April for allegedly
assaulting both Miss Taylforth, 39, and her driver. She withdrew her
allegations but the prosecution had intended to obtain a witness summons
against her.
In the days following the arrest and into the following month, a series of
articles appeared about the alleged attack.
The Attorney-General will argue when the case is heard early in the New Year
that the newspapers covered issues which would have gone before a trial jury,
including whether Mr Knights or Mr Davies was the aggressor, or whether Mr
Knights had acted in self-defence, as well as the nature of the relationship
between Miss Taylforth and her driver and the nature and extent of Mr Davies's
injuries.

IT will be lonely this Christmas for Abraham Baxter. He is refusing to move to
make way for a controversial scheme.
On Christmas Day, he will be home alone in St Clement's Terrace, Dundee - the
defiant last tenant in a tenement block scheduled to become a fortress to
rehabilitate ``neighbours from hell''.
Despite the noise and dust generated by workmen transforming the tenement into
a #1m high-security unit, Mr Baxter is sitting tight.
He said: ``I'm just sick of getting pushed around. The good tenants are having
to make way for the bad in this block.''

THE Highland Communities NHS Trust last night announced it would be shedding
the equivalent of 30 full-time jobs in an attempt to deal with a projected
deficit of #1.8m. It plans to save #2.4m.
The trust board, which in October accepted the resignation of chief executive
St John Hattersley having accepted his proposal to shed up to 45 jobs,
yesterday decided to revise its development plan and financial strategy.
It will now be based on three divisions rather than five, giving ``a leaner and
flatter structure.''
In a statement issued last night, the trust said: ``The plan proposes a
reduction in staffing of approximately 28.5 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts.
Eighteen of these are in senior management or administrative posts, with the
balance including ancillary and works posts.
``These changes will take place between now and March 31, 1996, by the
non-filling of vacancies, redeployment, early retirement, or voluntary or
compulsory redundancy.''
Mr Gary Maclennan, Highland regional officer for Unison, said last night: ``We
don't have the detail yet but . . . we will be involved in detailed
consultation which will begin in January.''
Meanwhile, Highland Health Board and Raigmore Hospital NHS Trust yesterday
denied reports it was closing eight surgical beds because of a cash shortage
and denied people were having to wait for vital operations as a result.
Mr Derek Leslie, service standards manager issued a statement on behalf of both
the board and the trust saying: ``There is no question of the Raigmore trust
running out of money and, indeed, the action has been taken in an effort to
best manage resources . . . ''

YOUR report regarding Nigel Griffiths's comments on the difficulties
encountered in attempts to use children to purchase alcohol as a means of
identifying retailers who break the law is somewhat misleading (December 13).
It distinguishes alcohol sales to under-age buyers from similar sales of
tobacco, fireworks, videos, etc, on the basis that the child purchaser, as well
as the retailer, commits an offence and implies that the ``test purchase'' by a
supervised child is a successful enforcement method in those other areas.
In relation to tobacco sales to young people, the Scottish Office Home and
Health Department in its guidance to enforcement agencies specifically ruled
out such methods, even where a child and parents were both in agreement with
the exercise.
In all areas of sales to under-age children the problems are further
complicated by Section 428(2) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1975,
which provides that those who aid, abet, counsel, procure, or incite the
commission of an offence by another are guilty of that same offence.
Trading standards officers would therefore be open to prosecution themselves.
Readers may be further interested to know that the Government, via its
De-regulation Task Force, recently scrapped the legislation that gave local
authorities (ie, trading standards officers) power to exercise control over
firework sales to under-16s, leaving the police as the only enforcement agency.
Inevitably, other more pressing priorities will take precedence, letting
unscrupulous traders off the hook.
If certain areas of the criminal justice system were reformed - not confined to
alcohol sales as Nigel Griffiths appears to suggest - trading standards
officers could effectively enforce legal controls in the retail sector leaving
the police free to deal with ``real'' crime.

THE Prince of Wales yesterday ruled out remarriage after his divorce. He will
be a king alone.
His decision, announced by his press secretary, Mr Alan Percival, was coupled
with his decision to obey the Queen's request, given in letters sent on Monday
to him and the Princess of Wales, that they should divorce.
It brings to an end speculation about the future of his relationship with Mrs
Camilla Parker-Bowles, removes the spectre of a future Queen Camilla, and ought
to ensure his eventual accession to the throne.
It also ends talk about his standing down, when the time comes, in favour of
his son, Prince William.
Mrs Parker-Bowles will remain, as she has been for many years, the royal
mistress and she and the prince will be able to be seen in public on private
occasions without comment. Although divorce is no barrier to Prince Charles
becoming king, marrying a divorcee would have met with bitter opposition from
many sections of the Church of England, of which he would then be head, as well
as from many other sections of society.
The Princess of Wales, apparently taken by surprise when the Queen's letters
became public knowledge, indicated she would not be replying until the New
Year. Although she said in her Panorama interview that she did not wish a
divorce, she has no alternative but to do as the Queen wishes.
It will be divorce by consent and, since the Queen's letters have removed the
barrier about her consent being required to the ending of a royal marriage, it
could become effective within a matter of weeks.
The task now is for the couple's lawyers to proceed with the complicated
divorce settlement ensuring adequate financial provision for the princess. This
could take the form of a lump sum of some 15m invested to bring her an annual
income of about 500,000.
The problem is where to find the cash. The prince's wealth comes mainly from
the Duchy of Cornwall's revenues and he has no access to the capital.
The princess will also want the details about her access to their two sons,
William and Harry, clarified, and, while not part of the settlement, there is
the matter of her desire to be a queen of hearts, a roving royal angel of
mercy, to be resolved.
Meanwhile, the prince's decision was applauded by constitutional expert and
former Conservative Cabinet Minister Lord St John of Fawsley as putting duty
and the nation before personal desires.
One leading churchman, the Archdeacon of York, however, warned the prince
against having a relationship with Mrs Parker-Bowles outside marriage. Mrs
Parker-Bowles's brother-in-law, Mr Simon Elliot said she would not be
commenting.
There could be some delay over a decree nisi as the principal lawyers
concerned were away on holiday.
Lord Blake, the constitutional historian and royal adviser, said the prince's
announcement made no difference to constitutional and legal claims to the
throne. "It may affect public opinion. I would have thought it would not damage
his position at all." He added he did not think the princess could stand in the
way of a divorce, "having admitted to 21 million viewers adultery with that
ghastly man".
"The Prince of Wales would have a cast-iron case for bringing a petition
against her. I don't think he would like to do it but I don't think she can
block it indefinitely."
The Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Eric Evans, said many would have
found Mrs Parker-Bowles unsuitable to be Queen because of her role as "the
other woman".
The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Church of England refused to make any
comment on the prince's decision, as did Cardinal Basil Hume and the Roman
Catholic Church.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine commented: "Obviously it's a very sad
announcement but I think it had become inevitable..."
Labour Leader Tony Blair said there would have to be discussions about the
future public role the princess would play. "I think most people, myself
included, would want to see, should a divorce take place, some role for
Princess Diana..." Should the princess agree to a divorce by consent it is
expected that she could retain the title, Her Royal Highness, and be known as
Diana, Princess of Wales. Her trump card remains the children. Whatever else
happens, as the mother of William and Harry she will be provided for.
